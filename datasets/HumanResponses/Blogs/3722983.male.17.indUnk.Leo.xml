      I had McDonald's for lunch for about the fourth time in the past week.  Same thing every time, a #5 and a hamburger, could I get some honey with that too?  It's very good but I'm probably not losing very much weight or getting any healthier.  I also printed a 30-page thing on Slovak declension.  It took about an hour and I felt like I was wasting a whole lot of paper and ink, but I figured oh well, I'm not paying for it.  We played hockey but the highlight was the dog chase.  While we were taking a break from hockey a dog ran by, followed by a man and his wife who were chasing the dog.  We decided to help out and were soon joined by about 4 or 5 other people trying to catch the little varmint.  We never caught it, it escaped into the golf course (LaFortune), but it was really fun and it gave us a good workout.  We almost caught it several times, and Tyler even touched it once, but it always weaseled its way out.  Right before the chase this girl went jogging by, and as she was jogging by she kind of just pulled off her shirt like it was no big deal.  Well, it was a big deal, and we were grateful.  Luckily no one else was around so we were the only ones to experience this delightful occurrence.  Granted, she was "sporting" a sports bra (haha) but hey, it's all good.  Then we walked the track at LaFortune (by this time it was 9:22) which took a really long time.  Another one of our bad ideas.  I am growingly increasingly tired.  Well, I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

      I don't exactly know why I am doing this.  Maybe it will be fun.  Maybe it will be thought-inspiring.  Maybe I will post in it twice and never again.  But here I am, making my mark on the Internet, totally exposing myself to the world.  By the world I mean a couple of my friends who get so bored they decide to finally check out what I'm writing, which by the way is going to be very little because I am known to start things and not finish th  Anyway, I think it would be kind of stupid to launch right into some shallow ponderings of mine right away in this first (last?) entry.  Then I would have nothing good left to write in later ones.  Who am I kidding, I KNOW I'm just going to quit with this very soon, saying 'Oh forget it, one site is enough.'  Oh well.  It's late and I don't want to sound stupid in my first entry, due to lack of being awake-ness, so I really want to avoid trying to sound all smart and philosophical.  Well, shouldn't be hard for me.  For fear of saying on here what is on my site, I think I will stop typing now.  This could very well be the very last entry in this blog.  Well, I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

      Alright, this is the third time I've attempted to write this entry, the first two times I got disconnected from the Internet and lost everything, which made me really really mad because I had been working on it for over an hour both times. They were both really good and juicy too, so I'll just try and remember as much as I can. Still, you can only write something for the first time once, so it won't be half as interesting. Ok.  First, I want to apologize to David, in case I made you upset or pissed off or anything. It's your life and I know you control what goes on, and if playing EQ is what's gonna make you the happiest, then Mizzuz Joja please, by all means, proceed with your EverQuest Online Adventure. However, I am allowed to chip in my two cents and that's all I was doing. You know I'd rather prefer you hanging out with the guys on a Saturday night than playing that game all night, but eh, your choice, and your choice is obviously most important.  Second, I want to apologize to myself for getting too political in the last entry. Any politics is too much politics for me. That's one of the major problems with Americans, they all care way too much about politics. You'll see later on that I have a lot more problems with Americans, but politics is definitely near the top.  Alright, now I'll get back to my regularly scheduled topic. So I'm getting to the point in my life where I probably should start thinking about colleges. It is possible that my parents would find this agreeable. However, due to my extraordinary talent for not doing extremely important things, I have yet to really begin my college/future planning. Thus, I have taken it upon myself to start now, and write down all my thoughts and stuff about the college selection process. This is all for my benefit but, lucky for you, you get to read it. You get to get inside my head! How often does that happen? Not very, unless you're a germ or a piece of food or something.  I'll start off with my life planning with college. I think that, in choosing a college, it's really essentially a question of familiarity and unfamiliarity, and which one I want. First I will look at the benefits and drawbacks of familiarity (I think I've been influenced too much by Parousia. In math he would always solve problems on the board and write out the solutions in sentence form, like "First we must differentiate with respect to x. Then we must separate the variables using cross-multiplication. Then we must integrate both sides, so we have ln y = 1 + x" etc etc).  Familiarity is two things, familiarity of surroundings and familiarity of people. Pretty much familiarity of surroundings will be accompanied by familiarity of people, but familiarity of people won't always bring familiarity of surroundings. If I want both, that means going to an Oklahoma college, like TU, OU, or (over my dead body) OSU. No doubt there will be a lot of people that I know that will be going to these colleges, and likely some of my friends. If I wanted to just play it safe and go into college knowing that I'd have some guaranteed friends, these places would be the surest bets. I'm not really good at making new friends, and having at least one friend to survive the first year of college would help me out a lot. I would love to room with Tyler, Matt, David G, or any of my other non-crazy-drinker-and-party-goer friends. I might not have that option, though. Just having that one person there would make my first year so much easier. Also, knowing where I'm at would be nice. Staying in Tulsa, or even going to Norman, wouldn't be bad except for the whole my-parents-are-close-enough-to-visit-me-unexpectedly-at-any-time factor that you always have to worry about, and when I say "you" I mean "I." I know my way around Oklahoma and I'd know what to expect. My ever-so-slight Okie accent wouldn't be out of place. I could come home at any time, get free meals and all that other stuff that the Huxtable college kids are always doing on The Cosby Show.  But what if I don't want any of that? What if I want to get away from everyone, everything back home? College would be a great place to take a step, a giant leap even, out of what my camp counselors would call my "comfort zone." Going to the Northeast or to California (where else is there? Idaho State College of Welding and Cosmetics?) would definitely be outside my comfort zone. Chances are, I wouldn't know anybody out there, save for maybe a few Booker T grads that I didn't really know very well. It would be a whole new world, and I'd have to go it on my own. That can be fun though. I really do like being on my own, and there's nothing more exciting than getting to go out and explore a brand new city like LA or Boston on my own. Actually I've been to Boston, but it was with a school group, so you know, just the historical stuff. I absolutely loved Boston though, it would be an awesome place to work and live, and I have the Red Sox and Bruins there so there's always a game to go to. LA might be even better for college, simply because of the Dodgers and the Kings. Man, what could be better than getting to see 20+ Kings games every season in LA? Also, I hear there's a pretty attractive young lady living in the vicinity of LA, but unfortunately she's been claimed by Tyler... If I did go far away, I'd explore the area because that's the kind of stuff I like doing. I wouldn't be one of those bums who sits in his dorm room playing hearts online and watching reruns of Cops, I'd go out and do the town. Fun stuff, 'twould be. But still, there's that not-knowing-anyone that would put a little fear into anyone. I don't know. Depends on if I'm feeling adventurous or not at the time of choosing a college.  So I guess I can make a short, rough-draft list that will surely shrink and grow accordingly: (in no order) Stanford, USC, UCLA, Boston College, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Washington in St Louis, maybe Berkeley, maybe Boston University, and if I stay close to home, TU and OU. There. There's a start.  And then there's after college. What to do with life? I'm one of those kids that's not really interested in anything that can get me a job; pretty much my life revolves around hockey, and I doubt I have a future in that unless I become a stats analyst or something. Well, I guess there's always a chance that I go on to play roller hockey in college, then get discovered and play pro or international for Team USA, although I doubt that that really brings in the dough. So I'll have to figure it out later.  Stu says he's going to be an oyster farmer, Tyler's going to sell onions from a bike in a Celtic village, and I say I'll be a shoe repairman (cobbler) in Slovakia. That's not entirely a joke on my part. It is my dream to go to Slovakia. In fact, it is my dream to travel all over, wherever I want. I hope I get rich enough so that I can just go live in some foreign country for as long as I feel like it, then move on to the next place until I go everywhere on my list. That list would include pretty much all of Europe, plus some other places: Slovakia, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Yap, and Canada (where they actually appreciate hockey!). I don't much care for Africa, Asia, and everywhere else, I'd rather live til I'm 30, thank you very much. I figure I'll make it to Slovakia someday, probably during college or right after. I think by then I'll know enough of the language and have enough money to really experience it all. I have a friend there who lives in Presov, Eva, and I'll surely meet her and have her show me around and stuff. It'll be a blast, and I have a good feeling deep down that it'll happen. It'll be the best time of my life, no doubt. I also kind of want to travel around Europe during college with a friend, preferably Matt. My mom did it and she had a blast, I figure we could do the same. Traveling with your family sucks, I have to do it all the time, you can never do what you want to do and you can't talk to girls or anybody because your family's always there. If me and Matt were to go to Europe, we'd do whatever we wanted. None of that boring parent stuff, just fun and interesting stuff. So there's that to possibly look forward to.  Basically I just don't want to live in America. I haven't seen enough of the world to really know where I want to live, but I'd fancy living in a small little mountain village in Slovakia and being, who knows, a cobbler or something. I just hate so many things about America. Everyone here is just, I don't know, a slob. There aren't very many people I like in America, you know, besides my friends and family and all them. I know this is highly generalized, but it just seems like everyone only cares about themself and everyone's just trying to make money and stuff. That's not really living. I want to do what I WANT to do. Life is for enjoying, not for slaving away for 30-40 years in some boring office job with no real goal to aim for, the kind of job where afterwards you look back and think, hm, I just wasted 30-40 years of my life. When I'm an old man, I want to look back on my life and think, you know what, I've had a pretty awesome life. So I just want to have a list or something of all the things in life that I really, really want to do, and then throughout the course of my life, do them. Hold on, I'm getting off subject again. (This didn't happen in my previous two drafts.) Why I hate America. Oh yeah. One thing that I really, really hate about a lot of Americans is all their fake national pride, like with their "God Bless America" bumper stickers and stuff like that. Most of all that is so fake, everyone just wants to act like they're all patriotic, but if they were forced to sacrifice their lives for the country they wouldn't do it. I know some of that fervent nationalism exists somewhere, but mostly people just fake it all, and act like they're all "one big happy American family" and all that other pride stuff. It got really really bad after 9-11. It just bugs me, people here do not care about their country like people everywhere else do. Places like Croatia, Poland, Slovakia, places that just got their independence after years, centuries of not having sovereignty, these people have a fierce national pride that Americans probably cannot even begin to comprehend. These people live and die with their soccer and hockey and I don't know, shuffleboard national teams, they CARE about the government instead of just criticizing it, they stick together and fight for the common good of the people. In America there is no fighting for the common good of the people, there IS no common good of the people, there IS no people. Everyone's in it for themselves, everyone's trying to get ahead of everyone else, it's sick. Plus NASCAR racing is considered a sport. Now that's just wrong.  However, Tyler, David C, and I have concocted a brilliant almost-foolproof plan that will bring eternal happiness to all three of us. I was going to wait until a later entry, but it seems appropriate now, so I present to you the plan of THE ISLAND. Here's the deal, I'll just give you the procedure step-by-step. 1. Get really really rich. How, I don't know. That's the difficult part. 2. Buy a group of three small tropical islands out in the Pacific Ocean that are fairly close to each other but not too close. They must be arranged in a triangular shape. This might also be a difficult part. 3. Each person gets his own island and is responsible for the completion of his hut and cave. Each person gets to build one one-room hut and one artificial above-ground cave that can be locked (the purpose of which will be explained very soon). 4. After building the huts and caves, we build a floating roller hockey rink in the middle of our triangle so that we can play hockey every day. 5. Get all the supplies we need to live on the islands for as long as we want. Also maybe have a boatplane so we can fly to and fro the mainland for emergencies. 6. Here's the fun part. We each kidnap 5 girls and take them to our respective islands. Recommended qualities: at least 2 should be good companion-type girls, girls that are interesting to talk to and fun to be around. It's also recommended (but not required) that they be attractive, for obvious reasons. The remaining 3 (or 2, if you choose 3 of the above type) should be there for one reason and one reason alone, and that is to be the slaves. What kind of slaves, let your imagination run wild. It is required that these girls be sex bombs so you don't get tired of them. Now, as for sleeping arrangements -- the interesting, fun-to-talk-to companion girls get to sleep in the hut with you, but the rest, the slaves, must be locked up in the cave all day, only to be let out at night per our request like wild beasts so that they may engage in nocturnal activities with us (well, me; remember we all have our own island). Isn't it great? Hockey whenever we want, the girls whenever we want...what more to life is there? We've all already selected our five girls, so we just have to get rich and all that other stuff and we're set. Here's the catch: Tyler and David both chose the same girl as one of their 5. So we had to come up with a solution, here it is: we build a tunnel under the water between David's and Tyler's islands, calling it the (let's just call this girl "Mary" for security purposes) Mary Transport Tunnel, so they can just pass her back and forth whenever they want. Genius, huh? Creepy, yes, but genius nonetheless. I think it's a great plan, however unrealistic it is.  There was one other thing I wanted to say about me hating America(ns). I really hate how everyone cares too much about politics. It's good to care about the government, but not about politics, because they're different, I think. Everyone in America is turning into Democrat or Republican, it's like gangs or something, and I just don't like it. It's either/or now, and it shouldn't be. I don't want to say too much about this because I don't care very much, but I did want to say it. For more on politics and government, check out Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway. You can also learn fun facts about the Washington Monument and about shoving your tongue down someone else's throat on a bus.  I think that was all I had to say. Like I said, the original 2 versions were a lot better and had a lot more detail, but hey, there's nothing I can do about that. I mean after all, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

      This entry will have two main focuses, different in topic but similar in underlying theme.  The first focus will be on what I call "people who actually think they can change the world."  I have always kind of been cynical about this type of thing, but I hadn't gotten the idea to do a blog entry on it until a few days ago when Tyler started picking up every empty paper cup he encountered along the side of the road during our bike ride to the post office and back.  I asked him if he thought he was actually going to "make a difference" by picking up four Wendy's cups and ended up going off on people like that.  He agreed.  Let me start by defining what a "person who actually thinks he can change the world" is.  This person is very ambitious.  He (actually, it's usually a she, so let me just use she) she is always supporting some good but generally boring and not-in-the-average-American's-interests cause, usually with some sort of non-profit organization that is destined to fail because no one really cares about the cause it supports and it runs out of funds because duh, it's a non-profit organization and who's gonna donate?  She doesn't have a normal job and spends all her time and money working for this cause, making cheap t-shirts and signs and standing on street corners with other "people who actually think they can change the world" yelling at and basically just annoying everyone who drives by.  She is single or divorced and probably not very attractive, but most likely pretty educated and what they'll tell you is "smart."  They are probably extremely liberal and criticize the government left and right, be it Bush Kerry Clinton or Glompitt.  Civil disobedience comes to mind, but the cops won't go near them because then the "people who actually think they can change the world" will start citing the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address, which wouldn't make sense at all, but they'd still do it.  I probably could have used the word "activist" instead.  So activists.  Go home.  Get a job that does not involve licking envelopes.  Get a spouse (this may be the more difficult part).  Become normal.  Because you are wasting your life.  All of your criticizing and poster-making and pedestrian-annoying is getting you nowhere because nobody cares.  Nobody cares about whatever you're supporting.  We don't care if it doesn't benefit us, and chances are it doesn't benefit us, so we don't care.  You're wasting time, money, and likely phone minutes which would place supporting worthless causes in the same ballpark as having a girlfriend.  Come to think of it, worthless causes, having a girlfriend.  One and the same.  Anyway back to the idea of no one caring.  You're not going to influence anybody enough to really make a difference and change the world, however hard you may try and however many times your leader will tell you you can and will succeed, because you won't because no one cares.  One example that I have been thinking of this entire time is my school's Free Tibet club.  The Free Tibet club is composed of the type of people I just described.  Their goal is to free Tibet (!) and I am not exactly sure what exactly they are doing in Tulsa, Oklahoma to achieve this goal, but it is probably something along the lines of making cheap t-shirts and putting signs up around the school advising all of us punk teenagers to Free Tibet, and writing letters to the Chinese government that are immediately crumpled up, burned, and fed to the dirt-poor peasants of Tibet in a radical display of cruel irony.  So the Free Tibet club is a WASTE of everything that can be wasted.  I just don't see what they're doing, they're not achieving anything or getting any closer to their goal and they're just gonna give up when they realize that it's hopeless and they have NO SAY WHATSOEVER IN WHAT HAPPENS IN TIBET, OKAY???  A bunch of "outcast" teenagers in a superficial high school in a cow town in the middle of nowhere just doesn't have any power and simply is doing nothing because nobody cares.  Man I'm cynical.  Focus number two.  EQers.  Specifically I'm talking to you, Michael David Carter.  You, much like the activists, are (ALERT: SIMILAR UNDERLYING THEME COMING UP) wasting your life.  You spend 10-15 hours a day on that stupid EQ game, and you know you're wasting your time and you don't even mind!  What kind of life is it to sit in a dirty ugly room all day and play the same computer game for over half the day, taking a break for dinner and maybe to sleep, for the whole summer until you leave for China for a year and won't see your friends again for that whole time!!!  I don't get it!  I've seen you play it before, it doesn't look particularly fun or interesting or mentally stimulating or anything.  You can't win in it, what kind of game is that?  Are you just hitting on the Hawaiian all day long or what??  If you're reading this don't get mad.  I'm just in a ranting mood and I'm just asking questions that won't be answered.  You are seventeen years old, you should be OUT HAVING FUN WITH YOUR FRIENDS and getting into trouble and meeting girls and racing up and down Memorial and just generally being a seventeen year old.  You think you're spending your time well, because to you the game is fun, but you don't know what you're missing.  You really don't.  I am deathly sure that you would much rather go rock climbing with Kyle for a few hours than spend another few hours playing EQ, where your thirst for playing can never be satisfied much as the ancient Romans' thirst for land could never be satisfied, and see where it got them.  Never mind that being a comically horrible analogy.  I'm just trying to save your life here.  Maybe you hadn't realized this, but this is essentially your last summer with all your grade-school friends.  Next summer everyone will all be busy making college preparations and such, and there won't always be time to hang out.  This is it.  You HAVE to make the most of your time as a kid, because before you know it, you're not a kid anymore.  EQ will always be there, but we will not.  There are better ways to spend your time.  You're addicted and obsessed and I'm just trying to help.  I personally liked my idea of hacking into the server, creating a death function, then creating a supercreature that could kill anything, then kill you so you would have to quit playing and resume having a life.  However, I do not think this would be possible without an immense amount of blackmail money to pay the EQ game developers or whoever, so I have to do it the old-fashioned way and write a scathing admonishment in my blog.  You're wasting your life, don't become a fat lazy slob who ends up on Jerry Springer arguing with your fat lazy slob wife about who is fatter, lazier, and slobbier, because chances are, I'll be watching that episode, and I'll just laugh and say I told you so.  Because I am.  My fingers are really sore, but hey, once the cookie crumbles in the way that it does, well, I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

      So I don't want this to turn into a journal, where I just write down everything I've done and that's that.  That's boring.  That was also three thats in a row.  That aside, it's hard to think of topics for this.  I've come up with a few but every time I sit down to write in this I immediately want to do something else.  Something useful.  But I do want to say this:  Having a girlfriend is retarded.  A while ago I came off what was my first true relationship with a member of the fairer sex.  It has a long story to it, but you don't care, and I certainly don't care.  But looking back on it, I can plainly see that it was a major, major waste of -- time -- money -- phone minutes Especially time.  I spent countless Friday/Saturday nights with her, bored to death and wishing very much to be out with my friends, playing hockey or at a movie, or even at home playing Yahoo hearts or refreshing the NHL scoreboard, or WHATEVER.  But, despite all these clear signs that I was wasting away my junior year, I kept at it.  I knew early on that I was already tired and bored, and there was nothing left to look forward to.  It was more trouble than it was worth -- it was lots of trouble and worth nothing.  Sixteen years old is not the time to be dealing with this kind of thing.  Relationship I mean.  Dating at this age should not really be a relationship-type thing.  It should be all about going out and having fun together and not caring about 'How long will it last' or 'How committed should I be', or any of that stupid stuff that only adults should have to worry about.  My second semester, junior year was almost entirely wasted on this girl that I didn't really know, much less care about, and I didn't really come out with any positive consequences, besides the new knowledge that having a girlfriend is retarded.  A few of my friends have/have had girlfriends, and they never last long.  The reasons vary but it's obvious that no one really cares to work at it that much.  David G is in the same position I was in, he's dating some girl and he's pretty tired.  When I was involved and I was told to "call me tonight" I would try and pick the time that would be most inconvenient for her, so I could increase my chances of her not picking up because hey, I didn't want to talk to her.  There were hockey games to watch, homework to do, card games to play, sleep to...go to.  Matt knows what I'm talking about, he's experienced the same.  But you can't just not call because then she'll think something's up or you just don't care and it'll turn into a whole big thing and then you have to get down on your knees and kiss her feet and apologize like a Jap and it's simply a situation that you really want to avoid.  It's really very inconvenient.  But let me talk more in depth about each aspect that was wasted.  The first and most important: time.  As I said, I spent so many Friday and Saturday nights doing basically nothing.  I could have done so many more fun things and had a really great time than hang out with the same semi-attractive girl every single weekend over and over.  Not only time with her, but also time on the phone, or talking to her online, or time waiting for her to call, time giving her a ride home, time thinking about her.  Fastball's "Time" says Time beats up on you, but it should say Girls beat up on your time.  My junior year.  One fourth of my high school years.  Geez louise.  Money.  Luckily for me, I didn't invest as much as some other people have.  For me it was probably even under $100.  Still, I don't really have a full-time job, and money is pretty hard to come by for me.  I don't buy that much but it's still nice to have for whenever I do, and that $60-70-80 that I spent is money that could have been much better spent than movies, dinner, ice cream, etc.  I could have bought a bunch of CDs, books, movies, not to mention a whole boatload of QuikTrip and Sonic drinks.  The whole time she paid for only one thing, a movie rental, maybe $5 at most.  That wasn't exactly expense sharing.  And I know that I'm lucky.  I never bought any $50 necklaces or anything like that, and I got out after only a few months.  Phone minutes.  I got a cell phone last Christmas and my mom and I shared a plan.  Normally I would use maybe an hour a month on the phone (hey, who's gonna call me?) but nooo, not with her.  It was, on the average, about 30 minutes a night, 30 minutes of pure torture.  Usually I just pretended to care while I watched a hockey game or The Cosby Show or did homework.  It really sucked and we almost went over on our minutes a few times.  Now that she's gone, my minutes pretty much have freefallen (-9.81 m/s) and I use maybe 5 minutes every few days.  It's great.  So those were the big ones for me.  Mostly time, because time is really important to me.  I'm extremely aware that you only get to be young once, and you only get to be in high school once, and you have to use your time as best as you can, because before you know it you're working 5 days a week 10 hours a day in a dead-end job until you're 65, then you retire and you die.  I have better things to do than spend my time with some worthless girlfriend who I don't really care about and I know doesn't really care about me.  I'm generalizing here, of course.  I'm sure there are MANY great girls out there who would make terrific girlfriends: girls who respect your time and space and let you go out with your friends and aren't demanding or anything and understand you and are interesting to talk to and do fun things.  They're somewhere out there, just not at Booker T, or Tulsa.  As far as I know.  So when I say having a girlfriend is retarded, hmm.  The best girlfriend would be one who is more of a really good friend, a best friend, but the bonus is that you get to get physical with them too.  That would definitely not be retarded.  But the kind like I had, who probably just has a boyfriend to have a boyfriend, or some other self-esteem-related reason, no, just stay away please.  It should be about having fun.  Nothing more.  And I wasn't having fun.  It's fun to have a really awesome friend that you can hang out with and burp around and play video games with, and then when everyone's gone you get to make out with.  Not that I know anything about that.  But that's how I think it should be.  Friends with priveliges at this age.  Unless you're retarded, or unless you have found your perfect soulmate who is just perfect beyond comprehension, no lovey-dovey I-love-you-forever relationships.  I'm sure we've all THOUGHT we've found that perfect one at least once in our young lives thus far, but usually at the time we're just too blind to see past the shortcomings.  Enlightenment is what we need then, and sometimes your friends give it to you, and sometimes they encourage you instead, not wanting to hurt your feelings (Doh gog Jama).  It's always better to have an objective viewpoint waiting to give you their input.  But that's not really on the point.  So the point is, having a girlfriend is retarded.  I've been enlightened.  Or maybe I'm just bitter.  Well, and so the cookie crumbles once again.  And that's just its way.

      Last Tuesday The Rink died.  Actually, to be more precise, The Rink was killed.  The Rink is, or was, a sacred place, a safe haven for us few roller hockey players left in Tulsa, a place where no one could disturb us and we could be totally at peace, just playing the game we love.  The Rink was built, so the legend goes, about 7-8 years ago. It's located between 51st and 61st Streets on Hudson (which is between Yale and Sheridan), wedged between the Memorial softball field, parking lot, soccer field, and football stadium. Back in its early days, it was top-of-the-line. It was surrounded by high chain-link fences to protect the spectators from misguided slapshots, it had two team benches (home and visitor) that were shielded from the sun by a nifty little wooden roof, 15-foot high bleachers for adoring fans and parents to come watch, a nice flat smooth surface to play on, two brand-new hockey goals, and even advertisements stuck onto the boards. It was a thing of beauty.  However, six or seven years ago the league that was in operation at The Rink folded, presumably due to lack of funds, and maintenance of the place all but ceased completely. First went the goals and the little maintenance shed that stood beside The Rink. Then went the benches and the nifty little roof, followed by the bleachers. The advertisements, which had been painted on, slowly faded away throughout the years.  In the months leading up to the murder of The Rink, it had become a sad sight indeed. Boards were either rotting or missing, there was a noticeable layer of dirt, someone had drunkenly attempted to paint a blue line (yes, only one!), the bench doors were off the hinges, nails were poking out everywhere, the chain-link fences were as holey as a prairie dog village, the paint was chipping off, there was graffiti all over the boards, the concrete was littered with the remains of broken skate wheels, stick blades, and goalposts, and there was grass (grass!) growing out of the cracks in the concrete.  The first time we played there was a long time ago, seventh grade I believe. It was a chilly, rainy Saturday morning and the rink was all wet but we gave it a try anyway. A bunch of people showed up and we had a great time. Little did we know that this would be the first of many, many times to spend our Saturdays and Sundays and any-days at The Rink.  A lot of different people played with us there over the years; besides the usuals (me, Tyler, David C) there was Shane, Brandt, Wade, Rob, Sam, Joe, Cory, Michael, David T, Max, Bradley, Marshall, my brother, Travis, David G, Blake, and probably a few others as well. Friendships were made, torn, and mended on the rink. There's nothing like getting together on a Saturday morning with a bunch of guys and playin a good fun game of hockey.  Throughout the school year, especially during fall and winter, we would try and get out to The Rink as often as possible, usually on a Saturday morning, to play World Cup or a high-scoring game for a couple hours. In summer if it wasn't too hot we'd make it as often as we could, although it usually was too hot and we'd just end up leaving, sweaty and grumpy. This last year it was every weekend, sometimes twice, after school Friday and after 4 on Saturday. It gave the weekends meaning and it was guaranteed fun.  Fortunately, Tyler, David C, and I were there the night before they tore it down. We played for a while, as was the custom, and when we got tired we went and sat on the sideboards and talked about life, or just sat and watched for hot joggers, just like always. Then we left, just like it was no big deal and The Rink would always be there for us, just for us. It really pretty much did belong to us. Through all the years that we played there, we only saw other people playing there maybe 10 times, and it was rarely more than 5 people at a time, and that's out of hundreds of trips to The Rink. It really was ours.  Anyway, the next evening Tyler and I went out there intending to sweep it up a bit so the puck wouldn't skitter as much. Usually when we are turning into the parking lot, one of us says, in a fat-sweaty-hick-construction-worker voice: "Well boys, looks like we're gonna have to tear this thing down!" just as a joke, because we knew that they would tear it down someday, and joking around eased the fear, I guess. This time though, we didn't do it. We turned in and we both had the same reaction. Our eyes popped out and our jaws dropped, and we were shocked. There, where our proud beautiful Rink had once stood, was a heaping pile of old rotting wood (the boards) surrounded by bright yellow evil caution tape. We pulled up quickly and got out and were just shocked, so shocked that we didn't even care that the Memorial girls softball team was practicing (which, trust me, must have meant we were really shocked). Tyler started yelling No, they can't do this! while I just shook my head and walked around, observing the damage. After the inital shock had worn off, I said to Tyler, You know what we have to do, don't you? We have to take home as much as we can of The Rink, our Rink. And that's exactly what we did. We loaded up our cars with as much as we could get of The Rink: both bench doors, the old Tulsa Hockey Sales sign, some chain-link fence, some random boards and pieces of metal, a couple poles and posts...anything that would fit in our cars, we salvaged it and took it to Tyler's garage, where it's all still sitting. We returned to say our final good-byes. David arrived by pure chance and joined us. We tore down all the caution tape in a rage and stuck it in a trash can, then put hockey sticks over it all as if to say hockey conquers all. We put back in place as many of the boards as we could, for nothing else than to make a statement to whoever tore it down. Then we lied down on the boards or the concrete for awhile...and left.  The next day we called TPS and found out they tore it down because the boards were rotting and unsafe. There are no plans to rebuild it, but there are no plans to use the space for something else, so there may be a really small glimmer of hope...  They can destroy our Rink, but they can't destroy our memories of it or our love for it or for hockey. We essentially spent the last 6 years of our lives at The Rink. It will not be forgotten, and it will be missed. We only have good memories of it, and it only has good memories of us. In fact, our blood (mostly Tyler's) is spattered here and there on the boards and concrete, so we are a part of it, and surely The Rink is a part of us. Good-bye, Rink.  You know, it's true. You never really know how much you love something until it's gone.  Well, I guess that's just the way the cookie (or The Rink) crumbles.
