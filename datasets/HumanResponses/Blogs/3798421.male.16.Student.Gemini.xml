       So...in continuation of yesterday's post...I have had some major problems with girls. It all started about a year ago. I lie. I have had problems with girls ever since Sarah said inderectly I was her boyfriend in the second grade. She was my friend since about first, and I had her over to my house one day. The next day at school, when we were discussing the word chandeleir (shows you how much I have learned, I don't even know how to spell it). She stated "My boyfriend has one of those in his bathroom.", and being the naive young man that I was, I thought, "Gee. I have one in my bathroom too." Thus my interduction to the world of women. But the big juicy problems started about a year ago. See, I started liking this one girl in school, well, not just one girl, because I can say I like many girls in school. But this one especially has turned into one that is important. I will say her name is Andrea, because her name IS Andrea. Anyway, I started liking her. I was looking forward to hanging out with her at this vacation bible school I help out with ever year. I was looking forward to hanging out with her, until I met Andilynne. Ah, yes, Andilynne. Blonde, very pretty, everything a man could ask for and more, yes? Oh yeah, and she even had a good personality. Unfortunatly, although I didn't know it yet, she was shallow even to the point of me noticing. I still don't have a clue wheather she fakes it or not, but she definatly acts shallow. Anyway, I spent the dog days of summer flirting with her. Of course she lives far away, so in all reality, I spent the dog days of summer wishing I was flirting with her. By the time fall came around, I saw her for one last time, got her phone number, went to her youth group...oh wait. Whadda ya know? Andrea is in her youth group, too. Strange. Anyways, as time progresses, Andi becomes more distant from me. It comes to a point where I realize she does not like me anymore. How sad. I confide in Andrea. Bad move, because I end up falling for her. As we both admit that we like each other, I think it is only natural that we progress into a romantic relationship, right? Oh yeah. She has a boyfriend. Oops. Well, maybe I can get around that, right? To make a long story short, no, I can't. And now I have to hold Andrea in the highest regard because she did not cheat on her boyfriend. So, my birthday comes around after we realize that our relationship will definatly be nothing more than just friends. And Andilynne calls me. Calls me THREE times on my birthday, if fact (I wasn't home). When she finally does reach me, she "confesses" to me that she still likes me. Augh. Not that I don't like it when a girl tells me she likes me, but I really doubt she actually likes me. I guess you would have to know the girl to actually understand. So, I try to break that off as best as I can. (As it turns out, I am still struggling to convince her that I really don't want to go out with her). So, it's back to bachelor. As you can see, I have had a romantic roller coaster, and just coming out of it, I really don't feel like entering another relationship like that in a while. Maybe I was a bit of a fanatic when saying that I am not going out for a really long time like five years. I can't forsee the future, but all I am saying is it will have to be someone really really really special for me to go out with her.   Someone like J-Lo.  Maybe not even her.

       So this is obviously my first, hopefully not last, post. It is difficult on such a system to actually put down the honest and true thoughts that you have in the full realization that people can read it. It is odd how, because I know that almost literally anyone could find this blog if they tried hard enough, and in itself, that is scary. Wonder if some stalker is looking for me? One can never know. Of course, all of this is silly. Of course people can read it. I am sure people I know will read it. So what? Who the crap should not know my true thoughts and feelings. If what you tell them is otherwise, isn't that being truely and utterly fake? I don't want to be fake. So, thus begins the blog. Don't pretend that it will be updated as often as it should, or as regularly as it should. Just know that it will be updated when it needs to be, no more or no less. As this is my first one...                                  I'll clue you in to my life so far. You can read my profile for any personal info, age/sex/weight/hair color/eye color/IQ/BO/type of toenail fungus, etc, etc. Here I will tell you about my life. I live in NW Pennsylvania, drive a new bulletproof black Caddilac STS and have a personal assistant named Johnny. Ok, so, no...not really. I do live in Northwestern Pennsylvania, though! Actually, I don't come from a rich family at all...but we have it pretty good, roof over our heads, the last in a line of three children, a nice, seven car family. Someday I will tell you what all kind of cars we own. Not today. And tomorrow isn't looking too good either.  Now on to my lack of love life. I have had some trouble with the ladies...girls...females...opposite sex...whatever you want to call them. Their trouble. At least in my experience(s). See, as a family rule, I could not date until I was sixteen. Three weeks ago I turned the magic number. So, how could I have so much trouble with women before that? Actually, I stuck by the family name and did not disgrace us. I didn't date anyone before I was sixteen. At least, not officially. See, a fine line is drawn between being friends with someone and being more than friends. I wish I knew where that line was. In all reality, I know I have been more than friends with some girls. But with all girls, I have been less than their boyfriend. What is that gray called? Make up a name for it and put in the comments part. Anywhoo, as I have had nothing really worth my while happen between me and a girl (and if you are thinking physically, you are wrong and right in the same aspect). See, I have never done more than hold hands or hug a girl. So you are right that "nothing really worth my while happen between me and a girl" could mean that. But, it doesn't. I mean a connection of some sort. Something that says "I want to be with this girl for a very long time, whatever the cost". And, the thing is, I don't expect that to happen. I don't think it ever will. Some of you in the older crowd are probably crooning "Oh sonny, just wait until that special girl comes along, you'll change that tune". Well, no, I won't. Because I was born to be single. I have established that so far. And, being that I have established that, I have decided not even to waste precious time/effort/brainpower/etc on a close relationship with a female. I know it won't work out, so why try? It makes sense to me... And of course, there will be the doubters that say "Well, how can you judge when you have never had a kiss or a viable relationship?". Maybe I can't judge. But, watching from afar, (the best place to watch from), I have seen relationships fail, falter, get ruined. I have seen couples painfully split, get back together, split again, get into fights, make up, break up. It looks like it really sucks. So, I really don't want to be a part of it, therefore I plan on not dating until I am completely ready. Who knows when that will be? Maybe, one could hope, never.  Maybe I am just a bitter old man in a young kid's body. A hermit or monk of sorts. As I see it, maybe I just learned the secret way ahead of my time. Do you notice how, in history, monks have invented and thought a lot of powerful ideas and inventions? It is because they have time to think, and don't worry about silly things like romantic relationships. And out of all the romantic relationships in the world, how many have been helping civilization? Basically, one on one relationships are selfish. I want to really experience the world with open eyes, not through rose-colored glasses, and it would be difficult for me to do that when I can't see past another "special" person. So, out of the dating circle I go.  Don't be screwed up, either, in thinking I am gay or something retarded like that. I am extremely attracted to girls.  Like a moth to a flame.

       The last few weeks have been great. I have had a lot of fun, except that whole getting sick bit. I have accomplished much on my car, getting the roll bar in and such. I still have a ways to go, though. Last night was great, my dad and I went to Shreffler's snack shack for their cruise in. The burnouts were amazing, it was just zoom zoom zoom one after another. I can't wait until a week from now, when I will be going to night camp. That will be fun. Staying up late, hanging out with all the peoples I know, like Central, Zack, and Deanna. It should prove interesting seeing all the peeps that were there last year, and of course all the newbies. I feel obligated to write about Andrea because she was gracious and kind enough to write about me in her blog. I mean, there is not much to write about, we had a nice long chat tonight, that's about it. Talking to her is always fun. Tomorrow I have to work on my car some more. I should probably go to bed soon so I can get up early enough to get cracking on my car. I can't wait until it is done. It will be really fun taking people off road. I remember when Mike Atkinson would take Micheal and me off road in his bug. He is the guy who started my brother on getting his bug ready for off road. I can't wait to join them. My car is all built for it, too. I can't wait until I get 3x3 trailing arms for it. That should put the stance nice, especially with longer shocks. And, when I twist the spline a few notches, that should bring that rear up like an angry cat. The front end, I don't need to do much. I just need to preload the spline a couple notches, I should be fine. Of course, the real thing that should help it is the huge tires I plan to put on it. 32 inches for the back would be awesome, buggy tires so that they are nice and wide. Of course, it really doesn't matter how wide the fronts are, in fact, the skinnier the better. They just need to be tall. When I connect the front beam to the bumper, and the front beam to the roll bar, which is connected to the center tunnel, the body, and the whole rear end, that will make the whole car integrated. It will be plenty safe jumping, and rolling it wouldn't be a worry. I am not sure yet if I want to put nerf bars on it. I suppose it is almost necessary. Ah well. After I have the body done, the fun part comes in doing the electronics. I plan to use a different harness, so as to make it reliable, especially with the larger wires. It will certainly be a beast when I am done with it. I just hope it will have enough power. A little 1600 is not exactly a pulling machine. It would be the bomb if I could fit in a type 4 engine, a 2.0 liter instead of a 1.6. Of course, the ultimate of ultimates that I would do if I could would be sticking in a vr6. Yeah, like that will ever happen! It would be next to impossible. I will just have to do with what I have to work with for now. Ah, dreaming of a vr6. Good night.

       I have been thinking a lot lately. &nbsp; Big suprise. &nbsp; Actually, I have been thinking, do dreams mean anything or are they just made of the stuff we ate that day? I mean, I actually beleive that dreams mean things. I don't know why this has got stuck in my head, I havn't actually had a dream lately, I was just wondering. Hm...now that I think about it, the most recent dream I have had was about two weeks ago. I dreamed that I was in school without a shirt on, and was asking people if I could borrow one. This is the closest thing I have ever had to what people think is a common dream of being naked in school. The weirdest part about the dream was that I was walking around with Miranda Buchman, and she offered me a cigarette, and&nbsp;I smoked it (and later one more) and stated that I shouldn't smoke them or else I would get addicted. I can explain the part about the cigarette a little because of reading about the whole inner person thing at this blog,  urlLink www.andr246.blogspot.com  . Also, during the dream I was scared to death that a teacher or someone would catch me without a shirt on (even though I was looking for one) and give me detention or something. If you have any interpretations, or perhaps explain what the heck I could have eaten to get a dream like that, I would appreciate you telling me. &nbsp; For the last three days, I was at soccer camp in Grove City. That was pretty great. Andy Nosko and I even got a girl's email...that's a story! Also, during the camp, I went from 15 or 16 percent body fat to 13 percent. Wow. That is kind of sick, expecially since I didn't lose any pounds. That is all muscle buildup. Awesome. Now, Jared, try and keep it up. Anyway, it's like, 11:27 and I am feeling tired. Maybe I should go to bed. Nah... &nbsp; I was reading on the internet, look up the word trillion in google and I am sure you'll find it, about a formula used to figure out what stocks are good, which are bad, what'll help, etc. The formula was likened to figuring out the double helix in DNA (a significant find). I was kind of curious, if such complicated things like the stock market be figured out with a simple formula, what other things in life can? I would like to think of myself as a logical person. One plus one always equals two for me. Despite that I hate and suck at math, I enjoy logic. Now, in life there is a lot of variables, and not that many, or perhaps none at all, stable areas. Many parts of people's thinking are documented by use of surveys and science. Such things as hormones, enviroment, genes, etc all play a role in what people act like, do, and say. Could all of this be broken down into a simple formula? Could we figure out what people are going to do, or about what they are thinking? We do have some pretty accurate lie detector testing equipment nowdays. I was just wondering if we could become so sophisticated that we could unlock all areas of our natural mind using something as simple as a formula. If you are a heavy thinker, stick that into your brain and ponder for a long time. So many contradictions will come up. If anything, thinking thoughts such as these will keep you busy. &nbsp; And speaking of busy, I have been. Today I welded in my roll bar, what a task that was. Beautiful welds though, gosh. I know it is probably hard for someone to understand how beautiful something can be that you create your self. This rollbar, and the awesome welds...it's like poetry. It flows. I can almost not bear grinding them down.  &nbsp; Sitting in my ignorance. Curious. Wondering what's next. Curious. Figuring out the future. Curious. Asking the right questions. At all the wrong times. Figures. Looking one way. Figures. Running the other. Figures. What should I do? What can I do? What will I do? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       All my life I have been curious what that first kiss would be like. Considering I have never been in a relationship that has progressed as far as that, I think I should be the first person desperate to get into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. Tonight, I have realized once again that they are not worth it. While I should be sleeping at this moment in time, I am actually waiting up for Andrea to get back online. I actually highly doubt she will. Even if she does, my logic still holds. Ready for the top reasons why such relationships are not worth a wooden nickel?  1. They take time and effort that could easily be used for productive things (like sleep).  2. They also take money.  3. All you get is some physical and mental comfort for a short period(s) of time.  4. Three words: Sexually Transmitted Diseases. And even if you don't get that far, you have those kissing diseases.  5. Because they are selfish (one on one relationship), friendships with other people you know deteriorate because you are spending time with the "special person".  6. Because easily the hard times offset the fun times. Look at how half of the love songs on the radio are about broken love, love lost, etc.  7. You get joked about by your family, and friends.  8. In the end you get heartbroken and walletbroken. Broke.  9. In a one in a hundred case, you marry a person, and the mairrage has a fifty percent chance of failing anyway. And if it doesn't, you are stuck with the same person who gets on your nerves. Example: look at your parents.  And finally, 10 is the ONLY  REAL  REASON why it is good to have a romantic relationship.  10. Because you swap germs when you kiss, it strenghtens your immune system.  As you can see, it's true. Such relationships are logically not worth it. So, why do so many people want to get into them? Beats me. Actually, I have felt the feelings that everyone else has felt, I know why people date other people. It is just hard to put a finger on, and so to put out that feeling I have created that list. Now that it all makes sense, I can sleep better. Ha, Cupid, take THAT!

       So I was thinking...in this alone, I have posted 1000 some words...and I wasn't trying. With my luck, if I try I will not be able to post much. But, this morning I want to write a story. A long one. I have no clue yet what it is about. May God let it flow through me. Obviously, the way to get a story done is write about something you know well. Andrea and I are going to write a story at mack2007.blogspot.com in case you are interested. Of course you are. But, on top of that, I want to write another story. How am I going to do that? I have no clue. But, write about something you know, and so I guess that leaves me with limited options. Of course, I could write about cars. I know a lot about them. Limited potential...but that is what you get. Hmm...what else could I write about? I could write about school. I definitly could do that considering I live there. That actually wouldn't be all that hard. But would it be interesting? Probably not. I really love short stories that make people think "Huh.". You know, a really good moral. Or if not a moral, at least something crazy. Something that...well, yes, a moral. Ok, I have established that. Now that I have that down, what should I stinking write about? Is this Jared with writer's block? How did that happen? You know, Jared, for someone without anything to say you sure do talk a lot. At least I am a fast typer. This would be pure torture if I wrote really slow. My dad writes slow. He has made whoever came up with the "peck the keyboard slowly one finger at a time" method very proud. Not to mention sometimes his grammar is not all that great sometimes. But, God love him, he has brains. I know he has got to be a genius. Sometimes he wastes that. Other times he puts that to great use. I just hope that I get half of the ingenuity that has been bestowed upon him. I have really got to stop wasting my life. Things like staying up until noon can really screw me up. Tomorrow I could do a million things, but most likely I will do nothing much. I AM having a small party. That will be great fun. And I have to mow. And send a bill out for mowing the neighbors lawn. Also, I have to set up the volley ball net. And it would be great to work on my car some. Another thing that would be amazing is if I could actually get my car done in the future. I guess it all comes down to working on it like a madman. I can write like a madman, how come I can't make a car like a madman? You know, I have no clue what my words per minute are, but I have been typing this only for about ten minutes so far. I wonder if I could write a book that fast? If I could do that, do you know how quick it would go? It would be on the shelves yesterday! But, unfortunatly, there are things to think about in books like a plot. That sucks, because you have to think about it. See, here I am typing without really thinking. I am just seeing how fast I can type in a short amount of time late at night. Late at night is the thing, see? It is harder to make sense at night. Of course, I can't claim I am making sense here. I am rambling. I should really come up with someting cool to do with this blog. I know Andrea and I are already doing something cool with Mack's. That is going to turn out awesome. I can't wait to get to this one scene (that I personally protested, let that be on the record). Anyway, I can't wait because that should really be very interesting. Interesting is quite the understatement here. Actually, I wonder about that. I wonder if, because, seriously those two characters are the equivelant of ourselves. In all honesty, they are. So, if the story goes a certain direction, are we hoping OUR relationship will go in that direction? I really hope not. I think this because Andrea and I have already had a chance at a relationship, and it did not work out. I really doubt it would work out again. First off, I don't think I treat people the way I should. I get that from my dad, too. I guess it is a really undesireable trait in the Porcenaluk clan. Will I be able to change? I want to be kind and a good person, I really do. I also know that I have trouble with that. Speaking of things I know about myself, I know that I am not the best looking person on the planet, and I try to make up for that in personality. But, I am like TNT. Useful for short stints? Ok, bad metephor. What I am trying to say, is from the "data" I have "gathered" from girls who like or have liked me, I am attractive at first, at least, because I can be outgoing, and quick witted. That is when I am trying to further a relationship. I have trouble, though, when I have to be in a relationship for a long time, because I am not trying to get that girl so bad. Then I can turn into a real bad person. I know I do. And I hate that. You would think it would be easy just...changing. But it is as bad as trying to quit smoking (not that I would know). It is like trying to breathe underwater without air. Let's just say that changing the way I act is difficult. Is it my chemical composition that makes me like a tiger on a hunt at first and then a...I don't know...lion not on the hunt (for lack of better words) as time goes on? I hear that, at least in some sort of animal, they are doing these tests that prove that being someone who doesn't cheat on their girlfriend or wife is hereditary. There is this gene that controls that or something. I just worry about that. I don't want to cheat on anybody. So, there is another reason I should just stay away from girls. Not to mention, I think that Andrea is starting to like me again. I know she is reading this at this moment in time, and I wish I knew what she was thinking. All I can say is maybe I am dead wrong. Maybe she still hates my guts. But I highly doubt that. I am just hoping that I am wrong. Andrea, don't go that route. Me and her, we make great friends. I enjoy her company. I like talking to her a lot because sometimes I have no one else to talk to about my problems and feelings. But, I really can't/don't-want-to get into a romantic relationship with her. To be honest...I do find her attractive. But I also still find Andi attractive...I find lots of girls attractive, that does not mean that I want to go out with them. Boy is this hard to explain, and even harder to say. Especially because I know she is reading this. That is the toughest part. But, if I had advice for her, and I do, stick with Brian. He is good for her. I never want to come between the two of them. If this means suspending the story for a little while, that would be ok...I would rather not, but if it comes to that. I just feel so sick, I hate being the wedge in a relationship. Of course, if I am totally wrong, and am baring all of my feelings for nothing, well, it goes to show you how open and stupid I can be. In fact, Andrea is probably thinking right now "What a dumbass". Ah well, that is a chance I will have to take. Maybe I will just be able to blame it on a lack of sleep as it is 12:38 and I got woken up at four thirty last night...Maybe I can blame my rantings on that. Boy do I hate uponing up and showing my feelings. And it is even worse on this blog thing. Anyone could see it. It is also bad because I can't read reations. Ah well, I am confident that I am right...I am taking a wild stab in the dark here, but I believe her relationship with her boyfriend is not going too badly nor too good, and it is becoming monotenous. It probably is going towards that line of going badly, though. She wants some spice in her life, so she still likes me. Maybe something will become of it, maybe not, she thinks. It is sure fun flirting, though, she thinks. Well, maybe I am as good as a guesser as I think I am. Maybe not. I will how close I am by if I am alive after she reads this. If she does kill me, I want these words on my gravestone:  If your not living, Your dieing.  See, I just want to say by writing all of my thoughts and feelings, and exposing them out in the open, I am living. Therefore I am not dieing. It is simple for me. Go big or go home. I just want to experience life. I can't do that being all meek all the time, can I? Oh well, I probably just provided so many loose ends in this blog I won't be able to count them all. Sheesh. I am stupid.   Live is hard.

       Sometimes...I wonder why I stay up late nights talking when I should be sleeping. This shall prove to be a somewhat intimate and deep look into mine and Andrea's persona. Andrea enjoys flirting with me. I know it, she does it, and every once in a while I flirt back. It happens. But, mostly, now that I have realized how much trouble she is, it has become easier to just ignore these nudges she gives me towards flirting. More like flirting with disaster. A long time ago, in a land far far away, I found out that Andrea is trouble if you ever try to go any further than being a friend with her. She can be a nice person, but she can be very mean and very nasty when she wants to be. In being a male friend with her (for over a year now) I have found out a few things. For a successful relationship with Andrea as a friend, you have to walk a fine line between being too kind and too mean. I, obviously, have never found that line. I have found both sides of the line, though. In being too kind, she eventually wants to make something more of the relationship, even if she has already a very viable and useful, not to mention sound, romantic relationship already. I have also found that side of being too mean. In doing that, she becomes this hostile creature ready to bite your head off, and depending on the unkindness you displayed, she can come to terms with you and be nice to you in as little as three days or as much as three weeks. This period of unkindness usually occurs after a short time of being too nice, which usually leads into a small period of being mean to each other, which leads into the said three day to three week period of her being angry and hostile towards me, which then continues the circle back into the time of being too kind. I am still trying to find that fine line of being kind, but not inviting, or breaking the circle. Either way, I am getting this down to a science. Soon I will begin selling books on how to be a good friend towards Andrea. This has been a Discovery Channel Documentary On Andrea. Hope you have enjoyed the show. (lights up)  She wanted me to do a sort of comparison test between her and Andi. Unfortunatly, our comparison test servers and algorithms have been down for quite some time now, and are not planned to have up in running for a few months. I am sorry for the inconvenience. What I can provide instead, though, is a look into why I don't want a romantic relationship with either. Andi is a very kind person, and I have always thought the best of her. But, she is not deep enough for me, she seems to bring up the same points in conversation, not to mention she lives in a dream world where she can go out with a 19 year old and get away with it. Not to mention, she beleives her life will be led out in a series of events that are planned and will happen, no matter what. Like I said, great person, but I see problems with relationships on the horizon.  Andrea, on the other hand, is perhaps too deep. Although I have figured out our relationship cycles to a T, she always has her suprises. I dislike the way she seems to want everything, and I hope she realizes she can't have everything. For one door to open, another door must close. I have found that to be pretty true in life. There are many reasons why I will not and cannot date either of these girls without having brain surgery done, or on the effect of drugs, or without realizing I most likely will be the most miserable person on the planet. I am sure both of them will find the perfect guy to make them happy. Maybe they already have. I just know I won't make them happy, either one of them. But I wish them the best. Now I'm going to bed... Cue that time when Andrea won't speak to me...this might be a three-weeker, guys. Lol.
