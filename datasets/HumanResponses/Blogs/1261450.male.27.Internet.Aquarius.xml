      In the netscape api for LDAP; the LDAPSearchResults method getCount() doesn't work. When there was more than one results the count would still return 1. That took over 3 hours to figure out because we assumed the whole time that it was working.  Yesterday was a long day; our LDAP server went down and all the data was gone so after getting it back up and reviving the data our application was acting funny. Most of the side effects were due to human error.   I finally checked out Struts test case. And from now on I'm going to be a unit testing madman. Haven't test EJB unit testing but I have enough to get me going on Struts and Servlets; Still need to try testing a JSP, using integration testing, and functional testing. This all came about from the decompression meeting and I'm going to make it a standard for development practice and process.  I've looking at webservices usage. First I looked at Apache SOAP project, but then found Apache Axis which seems to be more up to date  and active.  Donny also enlightened me about how EJBs are used to implement RMI and RMIC is used to create RMI at a lower level than EJB.   @work  start postgress by going to /usr/local/pgsql/data and typing ./startdb &  This weekend I started working on my course materials, about time. I have no idea how I'm going to fit all this content into only three days. It's going to take me a full day to get people aquainted with the development environment and get through the introduction.  Working on getting the idea of developer data sandboxes going. Testing the usage of the servletcontext in cactusstrutstestcase. I originally worked on setting up the configuration variables in the servlet unit test case; but then I realized the system should initialize itself via the filter; however, a servlet loaded on startup would be better.   Be careful not to include language="java", errorPage="MyError.jsp", isErrorPage="false" in jsps that directive includes like         jar classes have different uid from web to ejb  fixed problem  compiling WS with glue made proxy objects for the client that would convert the Soap response of the server to an exception in the client. Nice. There was a problem of connection refused to host: 127.0.0.1 from our EJB server. This was caused because the machine name was in the /etc/hosts file so when doing a host lookup it would return the localhost ip instead of the machine's actual ip.  My estimate for how long it was going to take to deploy our app from staging to production was way off due to more LDAP migration problems.   From deployment yesterday, I have narrowed down the problem with LDAP. It seems that spaces are to blame, specifically between the user's DN and the entries in the groupOfUniqueNames. For instance, the user's dn may be something like this, "mail=joe@public.com,ou=people,o=jway.com", but in the group the uniqueMember attribute is "mail=joe@public.com,_ou=people,_o=jway.com", notice the space after the commas. Therefore, the search would not find the user and there we have a problem. We are planning to standardize. been working with cactusstrutstestcase; having problem with sending the actionform  This has been solved.. Ricardo helped me to figure out that the setRequestPathInfo() must be called before setActionForm() because the name of the actionform is looked up in the strut-config action mapping.   have ldap outputting logs now to :/usr/local/var/openldap-data/replog; sweet!

      Got a new project, since my boss wants to have a Web-based interface to our LDAP much like an employee admin, in needs to use EJBs and Web Services.   Had to reinstall a project that used IIS and Tomcat connecting to a SQL Server db. How fun! Had some probs with the registry entries.  Used the isapi_redirect.dll, workers.properties, and uriworkermap.properties   Deploying the e-learning project, Angelo and Tomoo freak out over difference in configuration. Had to slap them around a bit to bring them back to reality and show them it wasn't that bad and everything will be ok.  Had a problem with org/xml...DocumentHandler which had a class loader conflict. Cause: the jars of the project were old. *Resolved by copying the jars from itd_test_tool(currently working project) to the broken one.  JSTL x:transform is giving a nullpointerexception due to the tag not being able to find the xsl. The mappings worked on our development machines but not on the unix staging server. So far the only way to make it work was by putting the full url path (server name and all) into the import statement. Why won't the relative mapping work?   AHhhhhhh..... We, the team, just found the solution. Donny downloaded the most recent JSTL version from Apache and voila it worked. The jars that made the difference were standard.jar and jstl.jar

      Had a problem with the deployment of e-learning admin... turned out to be missing some new properties. Dnstart and dnmiddle.  Installed OpenCMS (opencms.com) and took it for a test drive. Installation wasn't too bad, Tomcat with MySQL. Not quite sure where to implement it. I'm sure there is more to the app than I've been able to figure out so far.   Eunee had the problem of 'Can not convert #STRING to a NodeList!' from within a transformation. The cause was a template call with a param. No clear solution but to paste the template content into the area it was being called from.  Doing some performance tests, Ricardo, found castor marshalling to be heavy on processing time.  Worked on converting LDAP connection to be like the DAO pattern, will take a lot of work to get done. Still getting my LDAP methods to use castor to convert entries to DSML. Have been having numerous problems with jar versions being different from dev to staging. We're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss this and how to fix this.

      Action had action form null; This was due to the relationship, in struts-config.xml, which connects to . The class reference in the was wrong.  Figured out the LDAP Connection similar to JDBC, in that you must clone the results if you are planning to use them AFTER closing the connection or else you get unstable data sets.  When dealing with objects, methods ALWAYS pass by reference and return by reference, Thomas tested this one.

      finally got cruisecontrol up on xwing!   CruisControl installation notes:  folowed the following tutorial: http://c2.com/w4/cc/wiki.cgi?CruiseControlInstalled  cvs must be on the path; this is done by installing wincvs and putting the folder on the path  "cvs login" may be needed  outOfMemoryError is caused by the dir value same as dir value. Should be set to location of test-results  (No Modifications Found) Modifications not being found because of clock diference between CruiseControl and CVS.  for the log/_cache files used in the webapp; if accessing via network files make sure the directory allows writing   1. checked out project to local folder   C:\temp\extract\javancss21.41\bin>cruisecontrol.bat -port 8081 -projectname myproject -lastbuild 20030401010000 -label v1_2.1 -configfile config.xml

      I was looking for a java obfuscator and came across these:  1. ygaurd - $0, free! but doesn't have string obfuscation.  2. zelix klassmaster - created in Australia, licence is $400. website didn't look too impressive  3. dasho - impressive website, ~$400, large client base - including Sun   I started out with the zelix product but the eval has run out. But I just found Dasho and it looks more endorsed.   Doing research for my Hawaii preso I made some cool finding. These are all related to the 1.4 spec:  JSPs can be full XML compliant documents, no more ; JSF is like the struts Form Beans and Form custom tags (support for validation, formatting, and bean-data mapping); JSTL has a "functions" package for string related actions;

      Angelo vows there will be 150 people in Jway by this time next year, due to XUI removed C:\java\import_check\ZKM.jar from jedit antfarm   Been looking in to some apache projects. With the help of Donny, I setup a first run of Maven on our Xui-framework. Maven generates some project docs which can be useful.  That led me to check out the continuous integration product Gump, but this seems to strictly be only used with open source apache projects. So, I've decided to go and re-setup Cruise Control on a free server.

      In order to connect to the data servlet I implemented the DAOFactory pattern.  This way we can change our implementation at a later date with out much hassle.  Learned about using the archway serlvet which connects the database though an xml mapping file.  We're able to get specific data by using a .js file and creating a message object.  Ideas for freemind: print preview, dynamic legend, branch templates

      i created a class to make an authenticated call to the data servlet. Problem is that if I establish a valid user connection then I can't invalidate the connection.  Therefore, all users after the valid user are seen as valid user requests by the data servlet

      Thomas showed me how to use the validation fields in excel. during the Visa deployment, learned how to run the Tomcat zip installation into an NT service.  Tomcat comes with an EXE that all you have to do is pass certain params.

      in order to get the perigreen web app to connect to the sql server the odbc source must be undre the system dsn.  Here's our code for using basic auth. on each request to the data servlet(in our search there were examples using Authenticator but that method was very limiting):    try {             String converted = new String(Base64.encode((username + ":" + password).getBytes()));             URL u = new URL(urlString);             HttpURLConnection huc = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection();             huc.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic " + converted);             huc.setRequestMethod("GET");             logger.debug("huc: permission " + huc.getResponseCode());             if (huc.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {                 huc.connect();                 BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(huc.getInputStream()));                  String str;                 while ((str = in.readLine()) != null) {                     sb.append(str); // str is one line of text; readLine() strips the newline character(s)                 }                 in.close();                 huc.disconnect();             } else if (huc.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED) {                 throw new UnauthorizedDAOException("username | password invalid");             } else {                 throw new DAOException("Problem connecting to data servlet");             }         } catch (MalformedURLException me) {             throw new DAOException(me);         } catch (IOException ie) {             throw new DAOException(ie);         }

      There is a difference in the exe and zip installation of tomcat 4.1.x.  Our XUI didn't startup when the tomcat was installed using the binary(exe).  The errors that we got were the same as when we had conflicts with the jar files.  When installed from zip it worked ok.

      what I don't like about the project I'm working on now: No way to cache views bec. a transformation is needed everytime. Not THAT user friendly. Relies heavily on XML and XSL, which for a programmer is very limiting. Schema is also limiting so validation isn't consistant
