      I spent the day with two of my classmates today (The only other two 'young' people here so far).  I met Rachel last week because the secretary at school gave me the numbers of the students who arrived before me.  I called her and she invited me for dinner.  We then went our seperate ways for Shabbat (because she went to Netanya and I had Lisa over) but she called yesterday and we made plans to meet up at school today since we both had errands to run there (she was checking email in the library - I have internet in my apt. now btw - not my toronto phone yet though - and I was picking up my Israeli health card).  We walked back towards our neighborhoods (she lives about 10-15 min. walk from me) and went to have lunch at a movie theater/cafe on Emek Refayim (it's an artsy little place and the only theater that is open on Saturdays!!).  As we were attempting to decipher our menus (her Hebrew is only slightly better than mine which is good but not up to menu standards) when our other classmate, Dan, who I had not yet met walked in.  So he joined us and we had a lovely lunch and afternoon chatting away.  I managed to order a Mediteranian Salad which was incredible.  If you have never tried the combination of Zatar and Feta Cheese, please do!!  Later, Dan and I walked over another movie theater to see if we could catch a movie but none of them start until later this evening.  As they say in Hebrew, CHAVAL!! (TOO BAD!!)

      Hello all! So.  I got here safely and I am now all settled in.  It took a while to get internet access (still don't have it in my apt., just at school in the library) so I've already been here for almost a week!  There's way too much to tell you all but I will highlight some of the best moments so far. My friend Lisa (from home but she's been here in the army for the past year and a half) came to visit for the weekend.  We shopped at the shook (the outdoor market) and cooked shabbat dinner together and went to services at Kol Haneshama (the Reform temple near my apt.)  Needless to say my first shabbat in Jerusalem was wonderful.   On Sat. Lisa and I had a picnic in the park across the street from my house (the Tiyellet for those of you who know it).  And from the spot where we sat down we had the most wonderful view of Jerusalem.  The amazing thing was that you could see my apt. and the dome of the rock in the same panoramic scene.  It was amazing. I cannot believe that I actually live here.  It's incredible.   Will write more as soon as I get internet set up in my apt.   Until then!  PS - if you are reading these posts email me to let me know.  I would love an idea of who my audience is or if I'm wasting my time with this...thanks!

      Hello there.   Ok so this is my blog.  Right now it's not much but as the year goes by I will try to post to it as often as possible to keep you all updated on life in Israel and what it's like to be a student at HUC and all that.  I will keep a diary of sorts and put up pictures so stop by as often as you like to keep up with what's new with me.  Right now I'm getting organized and ready to go.  I'm pretty anxious about the move but I know that once I get settled I'll be excited to be there and to get started.  So that's all for now.  Keep in touch!!  Emma

      So another shabbat has come.  This week went by fast for me.  Last night I went to Har-El which is one of the liberal congregations in Jerusalem.  It was not only the first progressive congregation in the city but the first in the country (47 years old!).  The services were nice.  They lacked the spiritual energy of Kol Haneshama (I felt) but it was familiar and comfortable and I'm sure I will find myself there from time to time.  After services I went to David Singer's house where a bunch of us were meeting for dinner.  It was lovely.  Good food.  Good company.  Good Z'mirot (shabbat singing) afterwards.  Then I spent the night at my friend Anna's house so that I could go to Shira Chadasha (another congregation) near her house in the morning.  Shira Chadasha is a big congregation.  The sanctuary is in a big open somewhat bland and undecorrated room.  It has white walls and a high ceiling and my first thought (funnily enough) is that it reminded me of the mosque in Kingston.  At the mosque in Kingston, men and women pray seperately but together.  The men at the front of the room and the women at the back.  They are not divided by any physical barriers but they enter through different doors. At Shira Chadasha everyone enters through the same door.  The men sit on one side though and the women sit on the other.  In the middle of the room is a thin, gauze curtain.  The curtain is kept closed during most of the service but them men and women can see each other through it. When you look around the women's section you see women wearin kippot.  Women wearing hats.  Wearing scarves.  Wearing shalls.  AND wearing Talitot.  During the torah service the middle part of the curtain is pulled aside and men and women both gather around a table in the middle to lead the torah service.  Men and women both read from the torah. While I appreciate all this, I still couldn't quite figure it out.  What's the point of a mechitza that you can see through?  What's the point of praying seperately when everyone can equally participate?  I asked Anna and she said something about how seeing one another accross the room is still less distracting than sitting together.  Fair enough I suppose but I found myself thinking about women behind mechitza's and how they often don't participate in the service but gab to one another while they wait for their men to come back from their rendevous with God.  The cynic in me wondered if maybe the curtain was just see through so that the women, knowing the men were watching, would be more inclined to participate.  I'm sure that's unfair of me but it did cross my mind.  My cynicism lessened when the curtain was pulled all the way open for the sermon.  I immideately scanned the room for familair male faces and found, to my surprise, my friend David Frommer from Kutz.  We meet up in the weirdest places...Cantorial concerts in NYC...Services in Jerusalem.  In all fairness, had I been able to understand the sermon, I would have been distracted by the men's side of the room being visible to me.  By my friend David smiling at me accross the room.  By sheer curiosity.  And then the sermon ended and the curtain closed.  Goodbye men.  Good bye David.  Back to God.  All in all, Shira Chadasha was an interesting experience.  I think it's an important place and I'm glad it exists.  Glad that there is a place for men and women to pray seperately together equally.  I'm glad I went but it's not my cup of tea and I don't know that I will be back there any time soon. The rest of the day will be spent on Hebrew homework, laundry, shmoozing in the park and havdallah at my friend Adam's house.  Then a new week will begin.

      We went to the old city today in our small trip groups (same groups as last week's tunnel experience).&nbsp; Text study was not as engaging as it could have been but we went to a neat little museum with a large scale topagraphical model (I'm sure I spelled that wrong!) of Jerusalem and a 3D movie.&nbsp; Despite not being overly impressed with the morning's program, I did manage to have some interesting experiences in the old city.&nbsp; First, as we were entering the old city, some crazy orthodox man asked me for money as I was walking by and when I didn't answer him, he grabbed my arm.&nbsp; I pulled away and gave him quite the nasty look.&nbsp; I was unharmed but could feel his hand on my arm for the rest of the morning.&nbsp; Then, after we went to the museum, my friend David Reiner made friends with a cat.&nbsp; I wanted to take a picture of them and the cat seemed to think this was an invitation of some sort.&nbsp; He/she came over and rubbed up against my leg and then promptly bit me.&nbsp; Again, I was unharmed.&nbsp; At least it took my mind off the crazy orthodox guy for a while!&nbsp; At least in the old city I wasn't worried about&nbsp; terrorists.&nbsp; I was too busy looking over my shoulder for crazy orthodox men and vicious cats.

      The thing that continually amazes me about this year is that I am learning things, not just about Judaism and Israel but about people.&nbsp; About myself.&nbsp; About the way I perceive people and the way they perceive me.&nbsp;  It's funny.&nbsp; Sometimes, there are people, who just rub you the wrong way.&nbsp; People who just hit all your buttons.&nbsp; Set off all your insecurities.&nbsp; We all know someone like that.&nbsp; Usually, we run the other way and never look back.&nbsp; I do at least.&nbsp; And if I can't, I find myself closed down.&nbsp; Shut off.&nbsp; Uncomfortable until I can get away and breath again. Even here, where most of my insecurities (not good enough, not smart enough, pretty enough, talented enough, cool enough...are you sick of me yet...I am) have melted away (and granted, I've made some major progress over the last few years self-esteem wise).&nbsp; Here where I am a perfect fit (would that I had gone to elementary school with these people!), where people tell me on a regular basis (seriously, and not to toot my own horn) how confident they THINK I am (makes me want to laugh and cry every time).&nbsp;. .Even here. . .sometimes. . .my insecurities can be set off.&nbsp; By a person.&nbsp; By a phrase.&nbsp; By a suggestion.&nbsp; A look.&nbsp; An attitude.&nbsp; And while I want to run in the other direction, something about being here, about having the luxury of confidence, makes me not do it.&nbsp; Makes me want to confront it instead. What is it about that person, that look, that phrase, that tone, that attitude?&nbsp; What is it that set me off and why?&nbsp; And where was it coming from? Because when I can take a step away from my insecurities...or when I can aknowledge and move past them...then I can look at where they're coming from and realize that maybe, just maybe, that look, that tone, that attitude is coming from a place of insecurity itself.&nbsp; Maybe I rub someone the wrong way too.&nbsp; Maybe I can be scary in a way that I can't even conceive of.&nbsp; If I can come off as confident when I'm not than maybe I am misreading people as easily as I'm being misread.&nbsp;  So, I'm challenging myself - again - continually - and I'm challenging my classmates who read this and all the rest of you - go out, find that person, that one person, who just scares the shit out of you and instead of running away, befriend them.&nbsp; Find out what's behind all the bullshit we put on ourselves and on others.&nbsp; Discover that maybe you're both afraid of the same thing.&nbsp;  Think of all the trouble we could save ourselves.&nbsp; Could have saved ourselves.&nbsp; All the extra friendships and connections we could have and can still have.&nbsp;  Go play in that yard on the other side of the fence.&nbsp; They will want to know how you get your grass so green.

      Of all the prayers and readings we've read last night and this morning, this is my favorite.   Answer us, Adonai, answer us on our Fast Day, for grievous trouble has overtaken us.&nbsp; Consider not our guilt, turn not away from us.&nbsp; Be mindful of our plea and heed our supplication.&nbsp; Your love is our comfort; answer before we call.&nbsp; This is the promise uttered by Your prophet: "I shall answer before they have spoken, I shall heed their call before it is uttered."&nbsp; You, O God, answer us in time of trouble;&nbsp; You rescue and redeem in time of distress.&nbsp; You mercifully heed Your people's supplication.&nbsp; Praised are You, Adonai, who hears prayer.

      Today finds me less cynical but no less certain.&nbsp; I woke up still mulling over the experiences of my friends at the wall.&nbsp; Josh was with Joel (see below) and many of my other classmates and here's some of what he had to say about it.  "I made the decision to go to the Kotel last night because the Conservative (they call it Masorti here) movement was holding Tisha b'Av services (including an Eicha reading) at Robinson's Arch, a spot along the southern end of the wall separate from the Kotel.  urlLink As David explains ,   'In a compromise, the Masorti Movement agreed some time back to hold their non-traditional services there, in exchange for being allowed to pray at all. But agreements are only as deep as the paper they are written on, and last night did not go over to well.'  I walked down the path leading to the arch and was confronted by a large crowd. Turns out that -- despite the agreement that their rabbis and political leaders made -- the Ultra-Orthodox rank-and-file didn't like the idea of men and women praying together. So they went down to Robinson's Arch to get in the way. Groups of Orthodox men and women yelled obscenities at the small egalitarian minyan. They tried to physically get in the way. They heckled those of us trying to get in. Lots of Israeli security was on hand. In addition to dealing with the terrorist threat, their job was to ensure a safe, peaceful, smooth evening. In order to protect the twenty (or so) Jews gathered for the Masorti services from the religious extremists trying to get in their way, they locked the gate. I was not allowed to pray in the one place it was supposed to be safe (literally and figuratively speaking) for me to do so.  During the existence of The Second Temple, Jews were engaged in Torah study, in mitzvot, and in the doing of good deeds; why, then, was it destroyed? Because there existed groundless hatred.  (Yoma 9b) I don't want to sound so arrogant as to suggest that I can understand the gravity of the Temple's destruction in personal terms. So excuse what may appear like a lack of humility when I say that, for me, the Temple was destroyed again on Tisha b'Av last night as I watched the security guard lock the gate in front of me." Josh's thoughts pretty much sum up how I was feeling about things this morning.&nbsp; Angry on behalf of my friends and liberal Jews everywhere and feeling like the history of Tisha B'av is repeating all around us.&nbsp; What does it mean when our enemies are now ourselves.&nbsp; Looking at things from this perspective, Jews don't need other nations to destroy our "temple", we are doing it just fine by ourselves. We had study sessions today instead of a full day of Ulpan.&nbsp; My group did some text study on the readings from Lamentations (the book read on Tisha B'av) and some of the surrounding Midrashim.&nbsp; Some very interesting stuff.&nbsp; I'm not sure any of it changed my feeling toward the theology of the holiday but here are some thoughts and quotes from our session that gave me pause for thought. My friend Ari pointed out, in response to my asking what the point of trying to be better people is if we're just going to be punished for the sins of our ancestors anyway, that maybe there was a better way of looking at Tisha B'av.&nbsp; Maybe all of those bad things had to happen in order for good things to happen.&nbsp; If the temple had not been destroyed, we would not be able to pray the way we do (as liberal Jews, as women, through prayer and not sacrifice. . .).&nbsp; Indeed, we might not be a people at all had we remained one small nation in Jerusalem and not been scattered and exiled and spread around the world. Then my group leader, Moshe, talked at length about how Tisha B'av is a way of dealing with our past.&nbsp; A way of admitting our faults and wrong doings and learning from them.&nbsp; It is not enough to move on, to be glad that we have rebuilt our city.&nbsp; Tisha B'av is a time for remembering, a time to acknowledge what he called "a stain on the Jewish people" (various misdeeds by our kings, prophets, and people in post-biblical time) and to face up to it and to the consequences of them.&nbsp; Moshe began our study session with this quote, but I think I will end with it. "If it's our sins (that cause(d) the destruction) we can make it better"  I am no more certain&nbsp;of the future than I was last night&nbsp;but at least, this way, there is hope.

      I am excited (and a little abashed) to announce that I have learned more about computers since getting here than I have in my whole life.&nbsp; While trying to set up Arik's vonage system last night (so that people can call him for free on his NY number like the way you all have or should be calling me for free on mine...) we accidentally unplugged everything and lost both internet and vonage upon re-plugging in.&nbsp; I am happy to report that two hours later, and with minimal help from techies at vonage, netvision, and bezeq (the internet and telephone companies here), I got everything back up and running.&nbsp; The tech people were, of course, useless (except the very last vonage guy who helped me reconfigure my vonage box since I had to set it up differently...), but I found that I understood on my own how to do most of it.&nbsp; Thanks to Uncle Bruce, every tech person I have spoken to since moving to Israel, and all of my classmates with their various Vonage episodes.&nbsp; I am now, officially, computer literate.

      The following is taken from my friend and classmate, Joel Nickerson,'s page.&nbsp; He, along with a bunch of my other classmates went to the&nbsp;Kotel after our service at HUC.&nbsp; From what I hear it was an overwhelming and somewhat negative experience due to the thousands of people (mostly orthodox).&nbsp; I didn't go with them in anticipation of that situation.&nbsp; I have yet to go to the wall since I've gotten here and wasn't about to reapproach it on a night like that.&nbsp; In any case, Joel gives great description and insight.   "From this distance, you can start to see just how many people were there. An estimated 8,000 came to the Kotel tonight to pray. The place is divided into a men and women's section and both sections were overflowing with people. As I stood there looking out at the Kotel and the mass of people, I actually began to feel a little nervous and uncomfortable. I felt as if I was an outsider in some way. Not that I didn't belong there as a Jew, but that this was not the type of Judaism I know and love. A group of us walked down (through the airport-type security) and descended into the men's section. It was packed with 'black hats' - the charedim (ultra-orthodox) who were sitting and standing in groups praying and reading Eicha. There I was in my jeans and green T-shirt and feeling completely out of place physically and mentally. The other Joel couldn't handle it at all and went to the plaza area behind the split sections to sit and wait for me to come out of the men's area. I walked around for awhile, standing in certain places and listening to the various styles and energy levels of prayer. I walked up close to the wall and decided that I would come back when it wasn't so packed in order to actually have a private moment there. But I have mixed feelings about the Kotel as well. There we were, thousands of us Jews, praying at a wall that, while it has stood for millenia, is still just a wall and in some ways, has a feeling of idolatry linked to it. Bowing to a wall just seems a little weird to me. I don't know, but I have a whole year to work this out. The whole experience was a combination of Jewish pride and submission. On the one hand, it was wonderful to be amongst thousands of other Jews from around the world. On the other hand, I felt as though I was outside the holiness of the place - as though my Judaism and my lack of heart-felt lamentation separated me from those 'holy' Jews. I think a lot of it has to do with my own personal Jewish identity issues, similar to many Reform Jews who find themselves amongst more religious people. To use a sports analogy - it's as if I'm on the team, but I'm third string, so I can sit on the bench and watch everyone else play, but I don't have the skills to be a starter. It's something I need to get over if I want to be a productive and proficient rabbi. Once I come to realize that my Jewish knowledge will be fine (with good training and learning), I will be able to teach others without them questioning whether or not I know what I'm talking about. This all may sound a little disjointed right now, but that's kind of how I am right now. It's been a long day."

      We had a service tonight to bring in Tisha B'av (the anniversary of the destruction of the temples and basically every bad thing that's ever happened to the Jewish people).&nbsp; Two things struck me tonight.&nbsp; First of all, the view from the garden on campus is amazing.&nbsp; You can see the walls of the old city (practically across the street!) and as the service began the sun was just setting and the old city was all lit up and pink and beautiful.&nbsp; As the service progressed the sun set and the city got darker and seemed more distant.&nbsp; It was eerie since the service readings were about losing Jerusalem and it seemed to be fading right in front of my eyes.&nbsp; Very eerie. The second thing was that in light of the political and security situation here it is not difficult to imagine losing Jerusalem (or all of Israel) again.&nbsp; It's scary and sad to think of what hangs in the balance or how easily everything could fall apart.&nbsp; I am also overwhelmed by not knowing what to do.&nbsp; I know that I can only change myself, and my attitudes and relations to others and try to set an example but I often feel like I can only do so much and the situation (indeed the world) is so out of control and maybe it's too late.&nbsp; Maybe our generation, or one to soon follow will find they've lost Israel due to their sins, our sins, the sins of everyone who came before.&nbsp; I have trouble with that theology but I also can't say that I see a happy ending just over the horizon.&nbsp; I don't.&nbsp; Wish I did.&nbsp; I don't know that it will all end in disaster either but Tisha B'av makes me feel (more than most days) that it's a distinct possibility.&nbsp; That history has and can repeat itself.&nbsp; That there's nothing I really can do besides pray.&nbsp; So that's what I'm doing this year for Tisha B'av.&nbsp; Praying harder than I've ever prayed.&nbsp; For Israel.&nbsp; For Humanity.&nbsp; For the world.&nbsp;

      Even though the air in Jerusalem is dry, it is quite heavy. Sometimes you really feel like you can sense the weight of the world on your shoulders. All the holiness, bloodshed, lust, longing, etc. can really get to you.   - My friend Adam Rosenwasser

      Wow.&nbsp; I am overwhelmed with happiness today.&nbsp; I have now officially moved up a Hebrew level to Kitah Hey and it feels amazing to be in an environment where I'm ACTUALLY LEARNING.&nbsp; I knew that Kitah Daled was too easy for me but I hadn't realized how bored I was and I had forgotten how much I enjoy learning Hebrew when I'm engaged and not being held back by stuff I already know.&nbsp; It's amazing how being in the right place can change your whole perspective on life.&nbsp; Everything is better and brighter today.&nbsp;

      Shabbat was sleeping in, relaxing in the park with friends and getting to know great people better.&nbsp; Fried rice and "dishing" with Ana and Sara Mason at Ana's house ended the day and havdallah in the park brought in the week followed by dessert with Zoe, Ana, and Sara at the David Citadel (WHAT A VIEW!!).&nbsp; A perfect day if you ask me.

      My friend Lisa called me last night (Lisa, formerly of Toronto, currently of the Israeli Air Force...way more Israeli now than she'll admit or believe possible).&nbsp; She has decided that since I've started Ulpan we should&nbsp;now only&nbsp;speak in Hebrew.&nbsp; This is partially my fault since last year when I did Ulpan at JTS I began writting to her in Hebrew and did so for the majority of the year.&nbsp; I tried to explain to Lisa that my written Hebrew is far better than my spoken Hebrew (I freeze when I have to speak to Israelis...fear of making mistakes...lack of confidence...you know me) but she would not relent.&nbsp; Our first attempt at a Hebrew phone conversation was not in any way impressive.&nbsp; She speaks like an Israeli and cell phone reception is not always a perfect thing.&nbsp; Between the two I understood her less than I would have if she had been in the room with me.&nbsp; It was frustrating.&nbsp; I want to talk to my friend about things that I can't verbalize in Hebrew.&nbsp; Not about whatever my vocabulary limits me to.&nbsp; I know she is pushing me the way that she was pushed when she got here and I know that I am lucky to have her and that if my Hebrew is half as good as hers when I leave that I'll be grateful but still... Maybe I'm just spoiled because most Israelis will let me slide into English when I flounder&nbsp;and because my classmates and I are not yet into the swing of speaking anything other than English with each other outside of class.&nbsp; I wish that she and you and everyone could see me in my Ulpan class (somehow I am in the 2nd highest level) where I DO actually understand 85% of what my teacher says and where I am in the right grammer level.&nbsp; I wish that I could take the confidence that I have in Ulpan class out into the Israeli world with me.&nbsp; The security of the learning atmosphere and the acceptance of my classmates melt away in the harsh sunlight and I hide in the English language.&nbsp; Would that I could push myself as hard as Lisa does.&nbsp; Mind you, she's always held me to a higher standard than I've held myself.&nbsp; Must be why she's my best friend.

      After a day of freedom and good food (Waffles for breakfast and REAL Japaneese food for lunch!), Katie and I decided to take advantange of the fact that we had no shabbat obligations and decided to stay in and just relax.&nbsp; We made shabbat, played guitar, sang pretty harmonies, caught up on our life stories, watched a movie and fell asleep.&nbsp; I'm all for the educational, spiritual, shabbat experiences and anyone who knows me knows that I'm not one to avoid going to Temple (I am here, aren't I?) but this was a perfect Shabbat evening.&nbsp; So thank you to Katie and Hi to her parents who read this site religiously.&nbsp; Shabbat Shalom y'all.

      So.&nbsp; As promised, here are pictures of my friends and I.&nbsp; This particular batch is from last week from Josh's birthday party.&nbsp; It took a while to get them from Josh (since I didn't bring my camera to the party) and put them on my computer and then on here....but here they are now.&nbsp; Should you find yourself thinking, "these party animals are the future leaders of Reform Judaism???", don't feel bad.&nbsp; We often find ourselves thinking the same thing!

      I woke up this morning to the sounds of Israeli's arguing in the street.&nbsp; Some woman yelling at some other woman in that angry but friendly boisterous way they have of yelling at one another.&nbsp; Other people joined in the argument and soon cars were honking.&nbsp; I just laughed before rolling over and falling back asleep.&nbsp; I love this country!

      Had a great experience today.&nbsp; We went to King David's city today and walked through the&nbsp;tunnel that he supposedly used to get into the city of Jerusalem to conquer it.&nbsp; I was very excited to go because I've never been there before.&nbsp; The tunnel was long and wet (water up to knees and thighs) and dark.&nbsp; It was cool (temperature wise) which was wonderful after a morning of walking in the heat.&nbsp; I always enjoy experiencing biblical sites.&nbsp; I feel that I can connect to the characters in the Torah that way; That by&nbsp;retracing their supposed steps I can&nbsp;get a better sense of what they might have been feeling or experiencing.&nbsp; I liked imagining David and his army quietly making their way towards destiny.&nbsp;  In addition to the historical aspect, the tunnel was a great bonding experience for myself and the members of my group (our class was split into three groups for the purpose of these little historical expeditions).&nbsp; The best part was at one point when Dave Reiner (a big tall guy with a really deep voice) starting singing Lo Yisa Goy (Ay Oh) from the back of the line.&nbsp; Because of the acoustics in the tunnel, we at the front of the line, could only hear the deep timber of his voice at first.&nbsp; Then, as we listened, we could make out the melody and join in.&nbsp; Soon the whole group was singing (in harmony of course!) as we waded through the mountain.&nbsp; It was an amazing thing.&nbsp; Very cool.  We will be going on further excursions next Thursday and the Thursday after.&nbsp; I will update and more amazing things develop.

      Sometimes, I read my friends web page and think, why do I bother?&nbsp; I can't write or verbalize what I'm feeling nearly as well as they do.&nbsp; This is from my friend Josh Barkin's web page.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's pretty great.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between him and David Singer, I may never try to write again.&nbsp;  &nbsp; “We fear the unknown more than we fear being lied to.”  Today, we spent the first part of Ulpan learning the word for lie (sheker) and liar (shakran), and then we each told stories to the class (in Hebrew), and everyone had to figure out which were lies.  Then we read a May, 1999 piece from  urlLink Ha’Aretz  by Dafna Levy in which the author waxes philosophic about lying. In Hebrew, the letters of the word for truth (alef -- mem -- tav, emet) are the first, middle, and last letters of the alphabet, while the letters for lie (shin -- kuf -- resh) are all at the end of the alphabet and in no particular order.  Levy quotes some scholarly work by Adin Cohen at Haifa University on the sociological and psychological implications of lying. In a survey of Israelis, Cohen found that people here believe that their politicians lie more than anyone else.  After we read the article, Sara, our teacher, asked a question for discussion: If we distrust politicians so much, why do we keep electing them?  We responded with what are probably very typical American responses: We keep electing them because there's no one better available. Or because we don't mind being lied to as long as the lies aren't big, as long as they're in our best interest, and as long as we don't have to know too many of the messy details.  Sarah agreed with us all, but added a more Israeli take: “We fear the unknown more than we fear being lied to.”  She said that lots of people would rather have a leader who we're used to -- and who is seemingly predictable -- than one we're not sure about. Uncertainty, and the fear and insecurity that comes with it, is worse than dishonesty.  It's a fascinating idea, and seems like an amazing (and uniquely Israeli) coping mechanism. Life here is almost unbearably uncertain, and people grasp onto anything they can count on.  Last week, a suicide bomber stood in front of a café in the German Colony -- less than a block from where I almost lived -- and changed his mind. He had an explosive belt on, and was armed with a handgun. It was his plan to shoot his way into the place (presumably, by taking out the guards and anyone else in his way) and then detonate himself. But he changed his mind.  I'd give a toe or two to know what was going through his head.  Thankfully, it's been quiet in Israel since I got here. A package blew up at a Tel Aviv bus stop last week, killing a young Israeli soldier (and if I were writing this in Hebrew, you'd know from the word I'd have used -- hayala that she was a female soldier), and two suicide bombers, including the aforementioned, chose at the last minute not to blow themselves up. The other was a fifteen-year-old boy whose parents sent him to blow himself up. He chose not to, and turned himself into the police. Now he can't go home. He's fifteen, did one of the most courageous things I've ever heard of, and now he can't go home.  Yes, it’s been quiet, but everyone seems to be aware that, at any moment, explosions, broken glass, and stray limbs could shatter the silence.  So I'll forgive Israelis for being overwhelmingly supportive of the security fence, which I consider a violation of human rights and a gross injustice to people everywhere. Israelis grasp at every straw of certainty they can hold on to. It's unclear whether the fence actually is preventing terrorism (especially given the infighting going on right now in the Territories, which could very well be having a far greater effect than the fence). But from the point of view of a Jerusalem resident far-removed from the chaos in Gaza, it sure seems to be working. The politicians say it's working.  Even if that's a lie, it's one Israelis have little choice but to believe. The converse is way scarier, and people need to live their lives, shopping at supermarkets, eating and drinking at cafés.  The Hebrew word for "lie" may be born from disorder, but Israelis can live with disorder and dishonesty. Just visit the shuk (the open-air market). When you're living a fifteen-minute walk from Caffeit in the German Colony, where a man straddling the fine line between life and death made the decision to walk away and dispose of his explosive belt, being lied to is far less scary than being unsure.

      In addition to posting pictures of my various friends in our various gatherings (they're coming, I promise!) I will also, from time to time, introduce you to my friends by pointing you towards their respective websites and blogs so that you can see what other people in my program are feeling and experiencing.&nbsp; We'll start with David Singer.&nbsp; David and I were on ad-staff together at KUTZ in 2000.&nbsp; He is in the Rabbinic program and he is quite the writer.&nbsp; If nothing else, you should check out his response to his experience with Women at the Wall (who I will, with some trepidation, join next month at their next gathering).&nbsp; In other news:&nbsp; Zoe is finally here!!&nbsp; So good to see my old friend and to have her here.&nbsp; I helped to move her into her apt. today (which meant I did not get home until 7pm. . .LONG DAY).&nbsp; She is living with my another of my new friends, Sara Mason (Rabbi Mason's daughter for those of you who know him (DAD)).&nbsp; They have quite a nice place.  Anyway, it is past my bed time.&nbsp; As my good friend Katie says, "NIGHT Y'ALL!!"

      So.&nbsp; I know I've been depressing lately.&nbsp; I was thinking and I want to say that despite the hardness of this place and the disillusionment, it is so wonderful to be here and to be here with people who are experiencing the same things and emotions.&nbsp; We are supporting each other through everything and that makes all the difference. Hebrew placements came out yesterday.&nbsp; I'm in Kitah Daled (level 4 of 6)!&nbsp; Thought I'd be in Gimmel (level 3) but am excited to try my hand at a higher level.&nbsp; I have an amazing class anyway, people wise, lots of my friends are in it which is fantastic fun.  Today we did scavenger hunts around Jerusalem.&nbsp; My group was in the neighborhood closest to campus so we didn't have to walk too much!! We saw some cool stuff though.&nbsp; Here are just a few pictures from today.

      We had an interesting cross cultural workshop today.  About why Israeli's are the way they are and where they're coming from and how to deal with them and adjust to living here. Some of it was pretty heavy so here's what I wrote as I was processing it all:  Israel is a heavy place The heat and weight come down on you The second your foot touches Holy ground. I feel it pressing - A burden I am not prepared to carry. How can anyone be ready for a place like this; The quiet sadness; The silent pain? A country in mourning Living day to day And here I am. Will I be crushed by this Or will I learn to share The burden; To take part of it Upon myself And live here  Day to day Without falling apart? Will I grow the thick Sabra Skin? I must, I think, If I am to survive this; If I am to move on.

      Last night I saw a movie at the film festival entitled 'WALL'.  It was about the security fence and it was VERY one sided (i.e. not very pro the fence).  It was incredibly depressing.  Very focused on the disadvantages, cost, and the compromises to the Palestinians rights.  Then at the end they showed images of the Palestinians climbing over parts of the wall or through the barbed wire (to get to work, not to bomb buses mind you. . .) but still. . .the worst part was that I was just as disturbed by those images as I was by the situation and the disadvantages the Palestinian people (most of whom are not terrorists) are facing.  What kind of person does that make me?  That I'm concerned for their rights but only until I'm faced with my own vulnerability?  When did my right to live become more important than their rights to freedom?

      As some of you may have read or seen on the news, there was a bomb in Tel Aviv yesterday.  Since I am not in Tel Aviv, I'm just fine so not to worry (you wouldn't believe how many people's parents called to check in on them. . .We are in a WHOLE other city!).  However, I won't lie and say that I am unaffected.  Any one who knows me knows how I can let optimism get the best of me.  I feel like I let the quiet and uneventfulness of the past few months trick me into thinking I was completely safe.  And with being able to see the security wall from my window. . .I think I created a false sense of safety for myself and maybe that was necessary in some ways. . .To get my head around being here and living here. . .But I feel like, if it can happen there, it can happen here, and to be honest (with myself and all of you), it probably will.  Now, that's not to say that I think I'm in imminent danger.  I don't take buses and that helps my chances a lot.  I'm not worried about being directly involved.  It's way more likely that I'll get hit by a car because the traffic related deaths are way higher here than terrorist related deaths.  I'm worried about hearing an explosion.  About hearing sirens.  About how it'll feel to be in a city when something like that happens.  Our interns tell us that the first one is the worst.  I can't imagine going through it once let alone multiple times.  I guess time will tell and I am bracing myself because to think otherwise is to lie to myself about where I am living.   I am not writing this so that you will all worry.  I don't want you all to worry because I am going to be just fine but this website is to share with you my year.  Not just what I'm doing but what I'm thinking and how I'm feeling and that's where I am right now. God willing, the year will go by peacefully and I won't have a year that comes close to resembling the one that my intern Sari had (when they all had to leave early...).  God willing I won't have to deal with any of this.   I was too far from Tel Aviv to hear the explosion or see the ambulances drive by.  I was too far to even know it happened until hours later.  Yet somehow, that explosion shattered a part of my life too: my false sense of security and sadly, for the moment, my optimism.

      Last night a group of us did Havdallah in the park by the windmill.  It was fun and beautiful and creative and it made us feel like we had really made it (which we have!).  Afterwards we went out for dinner to Olive and Fish which is a great restarant near school and the park and after that we went to a party at a classmates house.  All around a great evening.  Here are some pictures as well as one that I took earlier in the day of a camel passing through the park as we were hanging out there.

      I participated in something amazing last night.  Every year at this time, there is an art fair in Jerusalem.  Traditionally, the artists set up on Ben Yehuda St. and there is music and dancing and lots of food and large crowds.  Since the security situation began a few years ago, the festival was moved to the gates of the old city.  This year it was back on Ben Yehuda for the first time in 3 years. Everyone turned out.  The crowds were large and excited and I'm told, it was an evening to come out and say, "We Are Not Afraid!".  And so we did.  A group of us went and shopped and ate and sang and danced in the street and it was fantastic.  It was Ben Yehuda the way I remembered it, crowded and thriving, and secure (there were security guards at the entrance to the festival and circulating through the crowds.  It felt great to be there and somehow, standing up to danger, none of us felt unsafe.  It's one thing not to take a bus.  It's another thing not to live your life.

      We had such a blast last night.  The interns planned a social event for us at Beit Ticho which is a very cool restaraunt near Ben Yehuda St.  It's in a large outdoor courtyard with trees and lights and it's just beautiful.  You pay 75 Shekels for all you can eat wine, cheese, breads, salads, and pasta.  It was great!  We had a bunch of small tables and we all sort of circulated and got to know each other.  I met new people and got to know some of the other people I'd already met much better.  There was lots of picture taking, and at one point 5 or 6 of us got very excited and carried away beaming things to each other on our palm pilots (everything you've heard about HUC students and palm pilots is TRUE - we have them, we use them, and we are slightly obsessed!).  Anyway, it was a great evening.  Here are the pictures.

      I had quite an experience today!  My friends Rachel and Dan and I met outside my apt. to go to the mall.  While we were waiting outside for the cab (becuase we DON'T take buses), we saw. . .coming up the street towards us. . .two Israeli Arab boys riding. . . a DONKEY!!  I couldn't believe it.  Now, granted, this is Israel, but this is JERUSALEM which is a CITY and I don't know about you but I've NEVER seen a DONKEY in a RESIDENTIAL part of a CITY!!  I certainly never expected to see one anyway!  It was funny and incredible.  Luckily Rachel knows a little Arabic and the boys let me take a picture to document the occasion (in case no one believes me).  So here it is! I register at school tomorrow. I will continue to post as amazing things happen.

      Well.  After much preparation and lots of cooking I hosted my first shabbat dinner in my new home!!  In addition to my housemate, Rachel B, and her friend Katie who arrived this morning, I had Rachel K and Dan over (whom I've introduced previously) and also Rachel's friend Rebecca and Aaron and Liz Kaplan who arrived on Wed.  Rachel B, Katie, and Aaron are all in the cantorial program with me so it was great for us all to get a chance to meet each other.  Shabbat was lovely.  Rachel K. had come over yesterday to help prepare and cook and the lasagne that I made and the stuffed peppers that she made were both very well recieved.  I attempted Carrot soup but it didn't really. . .soup. . .and Dan brought a gorgeous Salad with the words "Shabbat Shalom" carved in Hebrew letters out of cuccumber.  Very creative!  We all had a great time and got along really well.  And so it begins.  Tomorrow there's a picnic that Dan and Rachel K put together and even more people are coming.  Can't wait to meet them all!  Anyway, here are some pictures from dinner.  Enjoy!

      What a night!  Tonight the Social Action Committee, of which I am a part, ran a Beit Cafe (coffee house) fundraiser with a talent show and silent auction.  It was fantastic!  The talent acts were great (people sang and did funny things - Anna can cross her toes and Ari can play Hava Nagila on his head!) and the silent auction (which I organized) went really well.  All together we raised about 5500 NIS (new Israeli shekels) which is about 1500 US dollars!!  What a great feeling!  Throughout the evening I had great moments where I'd look around and be amazed at my fellow classmates.  If we can have a night like this, organized in a few days with a few people and a lot of generosity and talent, imagine what we will do and accomplish over the years.  As we sang and laughed and did mitzvot together I looked around and tried to imagine looking back on this years down the road.  I cannot quite imagine that yet.  Right now it's enough to just wonder at and about who will are becomming.  Every day I see our potential, individually and collectively, a little more clearly.  I can't wait to continue doing amazing things with these people.  I am so lucky to be a part of this. (pictures of tonight and the Galillee trip to be posted tomorrow after I steal them from Katie!!)

      On Wednesday we ended Ulpan early and boarded buses to the Gallilee for a 2 day adventure.  We travelled towards the North of Israel making stops along the way to learn about the First Aliyah.  We went to the Rothchild Gardens, which were beautiful and then to the First Aliyah Museum in Zichron Ya'akov which is a beautiful town to which I had never been to before.  What a view!  We stayed at a Kibbutz near the Golan Heights where we had evening services, where the rooms were super clean (I roomed with Katie, Marcy and Lisa S.) and where the breakfast was typically Israeli. Then the real fun began.  We boarded the buses and headed to the Jordan river where we went rafting!  So much fun!  The rafts were big and the rapids (if you could call them that) were miniscule and for the first half of the trip (before the tiny rapids began) we were alowed to jump in each other's boats and thrown people into the water and swim around.  I did of course, get thrown in (Thanks Joel!) but it was refreshing and it made it all the more fun to watch other people get dumped in as well.  I rafted with Rachel C., David S., Tal, Sadie and Josh.  Super good times. After that we had a fantastic lunch at a restaraunt on Lake Kineret (SO GORGEOUS) and then went to the cemetary where Rachel the Poet and Naomi Shemer are burried to learn about the 2nd Aliyah.  Seeing their gravestones was moving as I know their poetry and music and have known of them as important Israeli figures for most of my life.  At the end of the day we took the buses back to Jerusalem.  It was good to be home (mostly cause we all smelled like the Jordan river and really needed to shower!).  Pictures to follow.

      Sometimes I realise things in fleeting moments and it takes a while to get them composed and down on paper (or...computer screen rather...).  It's amazing how quickly we've all settled in to a routine here.  I no longer feel that it's strange that I live in Israel or that I speak and study a different language every day.  I no longer notice buses driving buy or worry that the parked cars on the street are going to explode as I walk buy them.  The heat is hardly noticable or bothersome.  I feel like I've known these people forever. . . It's only sometimes - moments all too fleeting - when I remember why were here.  How amazing it is that I'm here.  That these people are here with me.  What we're doing here - working toward. I had a moment in Ulpan the other day when it occured to me that these people aren't just classmates - they're collegues.  Some of the people in my class will be in my classes for the next 5 years.  Some of them will work in the same city as me.  All of them will be part of my life forever.  It's crazy. Then tonight, I had dinner with Katie and Lisa S. and Marcy.  The cantorial crew.  We brought a chicken to Marcy's and she made cuscus and it was great.  Just sitting around gabbing and I found myself thinking how great it was that I will have these people in my life now.  Sometimes I get sad when I think about my rabbinic friends who will be at different campuses next year.  I don't have those worries with Marcy and the girls.  I know they're not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's comforting.  And it occured to me that these women aren't just my collegues.  They're my friends, and sitting around and eating and laughing (and being rude!) I knew it was more than that.  They are my family too. On a lighter note - I stole pictures from Katie and Marcy today.  Some great ones from Hezekiah's tunnel and of me being frum in the old city (also a great one of Katie and Dan).  They're all on my webshots page in the trip pictures album.  Enjoy!

      Attraction is so basic.  What people need from one another is so much more complex.  One does not guarantee the other and appologies should not be necessary.

      Hang on everyone.  This is going to be a long entry.  The day started off with a joke.  Since we had been told to dress appropriately for our visit to the Western Wall today, I decided to go all the way and wear not only a long skirt (to ankles) but a very frum-looking head scarf.  I did it to make my classmates smile and to make a joke of the fact that we can't just go as we are.  Can't just pray as we are.  Can never quite feel accepted in "our" homeland.  At "our" wall.  Anyway, it worked for a while.  My classmates laughed.  I laughed (especially when Anna told me that the head scarf indicated to people that I was married!) and it was fun to be in the old city and not get mean looks from the orthodox crowd.  In fact, I got smiles sometimes.  Felt welcome.  Was harrassed by orthodox children raising money for Yeshivas who thought I'd be sympathetic.  Things only got better when I offered to carry my friend Jo's baby for a while in her snuggly carrier thing.  Boy did I look like a young frum mother (pictures to follow sometime soon!)!!  Little did I know. We went to the Western Wall tunnels which was very cool because I had never been there before.  What wasn't cool was that the tunnels empty out into the Arab quarter of the Old City.  Now.  Let me preface this by saying that we were very safe.  The Western Wall Tunnel people surround departing groups with a TEAM of security men to escort you back to the Jewish quarter.  Men who have handguns IN HAND with their fingers all but on the trigger.  Nobody was going to bother us surrounded by these men.  And certainly nothing was going to explode in the Arab quarter.  But suddenly, it was not so funny to be dressed as an orthodox Jew.  The outfit, adopted with the intention of making me feel LESS conspicuous was suddenly a very big failure.  Luckily the walk back to the Jewish quarter was short.  Never have I been so relieved to be surrounded by orthodox Jews.  For a while I even felt safe. And then it happened. (don't freak out.  I'm fine.  Everything's fine.) After lunch we were heading back towards the Western Wall area when we found we couldn't go any farthur.  Police had blocked off the bottom of the staircase we were on.  There was a suspicious object down the street and no one was going anywhere until it had been delt with (which means that someone left a backpack somewhere and the whole area had to be blocked off, the bomb squad had to come in, and it had to be blown up).  We stood on the stairs for about 10-15 minutes.  Patiently for the most part.  I actually didn't feel scared.  I was impressed with the policeman and the efficeincy of the whole ordeal.  People were calm.  At first. But people don't like to be caged and in addition to not letting people into the Western Wall area, the police were also not letting anyone out. While you would think that when there's a bomb scare people would be happy to sit back and listen to the police, this is Israel and nothing's that easy. Just as we hear the suspicious object being blown up a block or so away (something like a soft POP not a big explosion noise) a riot breaks out at the gate to the Western Wall.  The people wanted out.  Police were running and people were screaming and it was not pleasant.  Actually it was pretty upsetting and a little scary.  Yes.  That's me.  Fine with the suspicious object down the street but scared of riots and upset by the sight of policeman running with raised nightstick type things.  Anyway, the whole ordeal left me feeling pretty shaken up.  Today made me feel like I don't know who to be more afraid of.  Being too Jewish means I may not feel safe around Arabs, not being Jewish enough means I may not feel safe around orthodox Jews and in the end it doesn't really matter because all it takes is one person's left behind belongings for everyone to be confronted with mortality and for all hell to suddenly break lose. Most days I feel perfectly safe here.  Most days I argue with others that I'm probably safer here than in most big cities.  Today made me want to crawl into bed and never come out.  And in fact, for the rest of the day, that may be exactly what I do.

      Today we had a community service fair so that we could meet people from different organizations and begin to decide where to devote our community service requirement.  I went over to the Young Judaea table after reading the description of their program.  Basically they need HUC students to help plan, lead and facilitate liberal, spiritual prayer experiences (services) for their group of 300 American college freshmen who are doing a year in Israel program.  These kids have never really been active in religious settings so they want us to help introduce them to different types of prayer and worship styles (traditional, creative, medatative, musical, etc.).  So I knew this was right up my ally and in the end, it's where I'm going to volunteer.  All this is well and good but not the point of my story.  I go up to the table and introduce myself to Avi, the leader of the program.  Avi points to the Canada pin on my bag and says, "where are you from?" Emma: Toronto Avi: Me too! E - Really? A - Yes. E - That's so cool! A - Where did you go to school? E - Queen's. A - Oh yeah?  I worked at York. E - Awesome. A - What temple do you belong to. E - I grew up at Har Zion. . . A - oh!  Sheryl Nosan was there for a while! E - Yeah, she's great. . .and now I'm at Kol Ami.  My dad's the Rabbi there. A - OH!  You're DANNY's daughter!  I love your dad!  I worked with Kolel etc. etc.  Really close friends with Nancy (W.A.) etc. etc.  ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN TO YOUR HOUSE BEFORE! E - (a little weirded out)  Really?  Was I there? A - probably.  Nancy and David's engagement party? E - I WAS there!  That's really weird. A - Yeah.  So you're doing the second generation thing?  You're dad's great.  He knows my dad actually.  My dad's a rabbi in Winnipeg...  and it went on from there.  So this is both funny and frustrating.  I don't know why I thought I could get away from all of that here.  You'd think I'd expect it by now.  Maybe I'm just sensitive now to wanting to be seen as being here on my own terms.  We RK's (rabbi's kids - and there are a good sized group of us in the program) get a lot of, "Oh.  You're an RK.  No wonder you're here"  And everytime I think, "Gee...thanks for assuming I can think for myself..."  It's funny that these things never really used to bother me.  I just really don't want people thinking I got a free ticket here or that I didn't come to this "calling" on my own terms...  oh well... what can you do? In anycase, Dad, Avi Rose (Nathan Rose's son) says hi.

      I somehow forgot to talk about Havdallah this past week.  We (a large group of my classmates and I) had it at Noah and Adam's house and it was lead by my classmate and friend Noam Katz who just happens to write amazing Jewish music.  The energy in the room was incredible and I could go on forever about it but my friend Leah describes it beautifully on her blog so here's what she said:    Last night, during Havdalah at Noah and Adam's, a room teeming with HUC students separated the peace of Shabbat from the routine of the week. As the room filled with song, with harmony and beauty, love enveloped that space between the sacred and the profane, bringing the two together in a dance that embodied the essence of shalem, of wholeness, of letting go of the rest of the world in search of a peace that is the calm amidst the insanity .

      Wow.  Talk about once in a life time experiences! Last night I went with about half of my classmates to a David Broza sunrise concert at Massada.  David Broza is a famous Israeli musician (singer and guitar player).  Some say he is Israel's version of Dave Matthews.  Others say Eric Clapton.  Still others say Billy Joel. . .  I had heard of David Broza before and had, in fact, seen him in Central Park when I was on staff at KUTZ camp and we took the campers to participate in an Israel rally.  I hadn't paid too much attention to him then though because I was doing my job and looking out for the campers.  So I didn't go to this concert because I was a fan.  I went because it was a sunrise concert at Massada, meaning it began at 3am in the middle of the desert at the base of one of the coolest mountains on the planet and one of my favorite places in Isreal, and ended with the rising of the sun which I had seen from the top of Massada on my NFTY Israel trip and knew to be an amazing sight. About 30 of the 70 HUC students went to this concert but we broke ourselves down into smaller groups for the purpose of transportation.  We went in 3 sheiruts (taxi buses), some which went straight to Massada from Jerusalem (about 2 1/2 hour drive) and some (like mine) which first went to Arad where we had to pick up our tickets (other people had picked them up in Tel Aviv earlier in the week).  Arad is a small city just south of Massada.  Our group (16 of us in 2 sheiruts) left Jerusalem at 6 in the evening and drove to Arad.  The drive was beautiful.  There is a heavyness about Jerusalem that you don't always feel when you're in the city but when it leaves you as you leave the city, you notice it.  Between our newfound lightweightedness (I think I just created a word) and the gorgeous veiw, we were elated.  My last trip to Israel was spent mostly in the south so as we drove down into the desert I felt like I was coming home; back to a place of familiarity and happy memories. Anyway, We picked up our tickets and went to a bar for dinner and drinks.  We had a grand old time eating, drinking, playing pool, shmoozing and getting excited for the concert.  After that we bought tickets for the bus to Massada which would leave at 2:15am.  Since it was only 11:30pm we found a park to chill out in and kill time.  Some of us slept while others played frisbee and chatted.  Those of us that wanted to sleep spread out blankets on the grass and quickly learned that it is VERY COLD in the desert at night.  Despite our various sweatshirts and blankets we were quite cold. Luckily, we are all friendly peaople and did not mind squeezing our bodies close up to one another under one blanket.  As I lay under the sky in Arad, shivering, I learned two very important things.  The first is that a tired Rachel Crossley and a tired Emma equal a LOT of giggling.  The second thing is that if you ever have to go to a cold country (or sleep in a cold desert) and you can only take one person with you, Tal is the person to take.  He EMITS warmth!  Around 1:30am we woke ourselves up, warmed ourselves up, found some bathrooms to use, and headed for the bus.  The bus left on time but took longer than the expected 45 min. to get there due to the heavy traffic created by the concert attendants, police, and security people.  Finally we got there though and it was well worth the wait.  The concert was set up at the foot of Massada at the back between the Roman Ramp and Herod's Palace (for those of you that have been there and know what I'm talking about).  We sat in the stands or on blankets and watched the amazing concert.  Broza is an incredible musician and you didn't have to be familiar with his music in order to appreciate his talent and the atmosphere.  The concert started in the dark.  Just the lights from the stage.  Then certain parts of Massada (Herod's palace for example) were lit up and could be seen clearly from where we sat below.  At one point, the whole line of wall at the top of the mountain was lit up.  It was incredible.  After 2 hours of great music and moving lighting, the sky began to lighten and the mountain and the sea below us began to become more and more visible.  David worked his music to a climax with everybody's favorite songs at the end so we found ourselves standing and singing as the sun rose above us.  It was truely an amazing, moving, beautiful morning. I am incredibly tired but so glad that I went.  Below is a picture from the concert and you can find more on my album on webshots.  I will continue to add pictures as well as I get them from friends so check back now and again. I'm going to sleep now.  It's been a long but worthwhile 24 hours.  A day I will surely never forget.

      There are new pictures up on my album care of my friend Rachel Isaacson.  There are a few pictures from a few days back when we had a blood drive on campus and then there are two beautiful shots that Rachel took from outside the old city of Yemin Moshe (where the windmill is) and of the King David Hotel and HUC.  Enjoy!   urlLink http://community.webshots.com/user/chazzan2b .
