      Yes, you read right...Some Jolly Rancher Lolly Pops ARE made more equal than others.  For example, green apple tastes like chemicals and makes me cough, on the contrary, watermelon is light and soothing and is quite a plesant experience.

      Today, I attended the Laurel Festival once again that is held every year in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania.  On "The Green" they have many tents full of people selling neat trinkets, hand-carved woodwork, lawn-decorating pieces, tye-dyed clothes, and hundreds of other unique products.  I bought two dollars worth of marbles which appealed to me...especially the orange and white ones that look like cream/dreamsicles.  In the north section of "The Green" are approximately fifteen food stands; They have everything you can imagine...german bratwurst, greek gyros, candy apples, mongolian noodles, old-fashioned orangeade, bloomin' onions, sausage, meatballs, cheesesteak, pie, pierogies, cheesecake, chicken sandwiches, and other exotic food stands.  This was the list of my "gastric-hoardings" from today in order of first to last eaten from 1pm to 5pm...  1.)  Old-Fashioned Lemonade 2.)  Half of a funnelcake 3.)  A huge strawberry shortcake (real strawberries, real biscuits, and really       rich, buttery, whipped topping) 4.)  Greek potato salad - perfectly cooked warm-ish olive-oiled potatos with       leaves/flakes of parsley and pepper 5.)  Old-Fashioned Lemonade  I am kicking myself now because I decided against buying some oriental mongolian noodles for fear of barfing near the "marble tent".  I will just have to wait until next year.  As I listen to the news they are talking about "Bill Clinton's Autobiography: My Life"...haha...what a freaker...And for DINNER (7:30pm), dad made a delicious bbq chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese, garlic, and romaine, all on a plain flour bun...

      I had so many carbs and calories yesterday...420 calories worth of chocolate milk, a whole bread stick and huge slice of lasagna, a clearly canadian blackberry soda, a whole basket full of french fries, a bbq sandwich w/ two slices of white bread, four twizzler sticks (all flour and corn starch), and two slim jims.  I felt so sick...but now, today, I am hungry.  I think, perhaps, I should go on a forty-day fast and not eat anything.  Fasts are quite healthy, because, at any given moment, your body is carrying five to ten pounds of toxins and other bad things.  Fasting releases these harmful byproducts of your body making you healthier.  I'm nost sure which DVD I want to watch tonight... either Office Space, Fantasia 2000, Behind Enemy Lines, or The Others.  Everyone told me it was going to be a nice day when I knew it was going to be crappy.  I woke up to ugly skies but now it is sunny...wtf is going on?!  I believe that the events that take place in the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" are not too far in the future from occurring.  We have all of these screwed up weather patterns that do not necessarily follow anything that we've seen in the past.  Barcodes are awesome... www.upcdatabase.com is my website of the day. I'm out...

      Today was filled with restlessness as I struggled to find other things to occupy the hours.  I got up approx. at 10:25am and started taping Ronald Reagen's funeral for my mom at 10:37am...it had started at 10am.  I got online to see if my friend in Niedersachsen (Dissen, to be specific), Germany, was on or Курочкино Надежда Сергеевна, my friend in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Neither were on but I chatted with my mom who was at work at the courthouse.  I finished watching the commentary version of "The Craft" on DVD, which is one of my favorite movies of all time!  I tried renaming and reorganizing my mp3s that i had to transfer from my iPod to my new computer hardrive which will be a strenuous task, seeing as how the names somehow change in the transfer process... I really wish there were a Starbucks within at least 30 minutes of here.  There are three in one city an hour from here which is not fair.  The one-pound-burrito restaurant, Chipotle: there is not one in the whole grand state of Pennsylvania.  I had one while in Baltimore on a field trip and it was extremely tasty.  OH DAMN!  I forgot that the stand up comedians on on tonight!...hmm...I hope I'm not missing any good ones!...My condolences go out to Nancy and the rest of the Reagan family...he truly was a compassionate human being.

      Привет!  I'm glad that this day is finally over.  If all of those preps hadn't been in my last period class of the day I would have been fine.  My internet has been going extremely slow so I had to reconnect about four times.  Now I am talking to one of my friends and she is telling me that she heard a "bad but true story" (hmm...) about me that shows exactly how much of an "a-hole" I really am...that's almost funny...although, she is sworn to secrecy not to tell me the story or who told her.  And she just said that the other main person is the true a-hole in the story and not me, after she thought about it.  Hmm...I want to finish watching The Craft, but I am too tired to watch the whole thing with the commentary without passing out less than five times.  You know, water doesn't really keep your breath fresh.  I wish we had central air in this house...it becomes quite humid at points and the air flow is almost non-existant unless you were to knock down the entire front wall.  I wonder if the gas prices are going to go down and I DON'T think that the power is going to be handed over to the Iraqis by the deadline.  That new Coca Cola (C2) is kinda good.  It has half the carbs and half the sugar...although it contains phenylalanine, which is the fake sugar in diet products that causes cancer in lab rats... до завтра!

      Hallo alle personen!  Wir sind in die Schweiz!  I we have had a great flight with no delays.  We checked out a swiss clock shoppe and bought lots of neat stuff in the village that that was in.  The wood carvings all over the villiages are amaying...most houses are over 400 years old.  Surprisingly, in the hotel that we are staying at (in the villaige it is in) there is a musik festival going on that we have been to...very interesting but since we cannot drink beer, there is not much to do there but walk aound and look at the sidewalk shops and food stands.  The language barrier doesn't really create a problem...usually only machines.  Today we checked out lots of waterfalls as well, but I must go now...only 40 seconds left...yak

      From today, there are only four more days until I go to Europe.  While at the mall, I went in to Holiday Hairstyles to get a haircut and saw my one friend from the skating rink getting her hair done.  She is being a bridesmaid for her one friend this afternoon.  Her hair was halfly-braided, halfly-twisted, with small butterfly clips everywhere and small curls in the back.  As soon as I step foot onto Paris concrete, I am going to buy fifty-four crepes...fifty-four because everyone else always picks a stupid number like "fifty" or "fifty-two".  Why did Coca Cola get rid of their "Surge" line of soda?!  I thought it was quite good...I know it's weird for me to be talking about it now since it happened many months ago (before Christmas), but I am just now realizing how much I miss it.  I like most all sodas except for Diet Pepsi (Pepsi One is ok though...).  I love the vanilla colas.  If you like both Vanilla Coke and Pepsi Vanilla, check this...v. coke contains artificial vanilla flavorings while pepsi v. contains pure vanilla extract.  Also, I mentioned in an earlier post that C2 contains phenylalanine that causes cancer in lab rats...Pepsi just introduced Pepsi Edge which has half the sugar and carbs (same thing as C2), but does not replace it with the fake sugar!  Amen to that, Pepsi!  They seem to be thinking more about what's "healthy in an already bad-for-your-body soda"...which is enough for me.  Even though Pepsi tends to go the natural way, I still buy Coca Cola more now just because the shape of the bottle is more appealing to me than the regular Pepsi bottle...lol...what a tart...

      Since I got my iPod from Apple about three months ago, I have gotten very poor quality output of bass and terrible sound distortion on my favorite kind of music, Russian Techno (specifically, the artists Русский Размер, Вирус, and Руки Вверх).  I have used a little music format converter for a while and decided to fool around with the bit rate and file type.  I converted some .WMA files into mp3s because Apple won't play windows media audio formats...go figure.  Lol...anyway, I discovered that the songs sound perfect, except there is still not enough bass to satisfy me.  I don't exactly know what I did differently this time to change the format because all of the settings are the same as last time I did this.  Anyway, I have only eleven more days until I fly to Europe for twenty-one days, which is going to be very fulfilling for my travel craving for a few months.  The drivers' saftey classes I have been taking all of this week and will continue to for the length of next weeks is total hell.  The teacher acts like a younger version of Mr. Rogers on delta-9 tetrahydrocanabinol, or even crack cocain...it doesn't matter, he's a little too happy in the mornings but is annoying at the same time, which is nearly impossible for the rest of us.  Now, I must look for my camera tripod before my trip so I don't miss the perfect long exposure shot of the Notre Dame cathedral...this house is such a mess I'll never find it in the piles of shiz flooding my "space"...
