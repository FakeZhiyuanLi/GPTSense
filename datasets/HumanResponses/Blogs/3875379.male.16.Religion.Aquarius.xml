        Tilling my own grave to keep me level     Jam another dragon down the hole     Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren     One that pushes me along and leaves me so           Desperate and Ravenous     I'm so weak and powerless over you          Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China     White as Dracula as I approach the bottom          Desperate and Ravenous     I'm so weak and powerless over you          Pale angel go away     Come again some other day     The devil has my ear today     I'll never hear of what you say     Promised I would find a little solace     And some piece of mind     Whatever just as long as I don't feel so          Desperate and Ravenous     I'm so weak and powerless over you     Desperate and Ravenous     I'm so weak and powerless over you

       urlLink    Say hello to the rug's topography  It holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it  Say hello to the shrinking in your head  You can't see it but you know its there so don't neglect it   I'm taking her home with me all dressed in white  She's got everything I need pharmacy keys  She's falling hard for me I can see it in her eyes  She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys   Say hello to all the apples on the ground   They were once in your eyes but you sneezed them out while sleeping  Say hello to everything you've left behind  It's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it   I'm taking her home with me all dressed in white  She's got everything I need some pills and a little cup  She's falling hard for me I can see it in her eyes  She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    So glad to see you well  Overcome and completely silent now  Without himself  You cast your demons out  And not to pull your halo down  Around your neck and tug you off your cloud  But I'm more than just curious  How you're planning to go about  Making your amends to the dead  To the dead   Recall the deeds as if  They're all someone else's  Atrocious stories  Now you stand reborn before us all  So glad to see you well   And not to pull your halo down  Around your neck and tug you to the ground  But I'm more than just curious  How you're planning to go about  Making your amends to the dead  To the dead   With your halo slipping down  Your halo slipping  Your halo slipping down  Your halo slipping down  Your halo slipping down  Your halo slipping down to choke you now &nbsp; urlLink

       Dreaming of that face again.   It's bright and blue and shimmering.   Grinning wideAnd comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes.      On my back and tumbling   Down that hole and back again Rising up   And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.    In... Out... In... Out... In... Out...    A child's rhyme stuck in my head.   It said that life is but a dream.   I've spent so many years in questionto find I've known this all along.    "So good to see you.   I've missed you so much.   So glad it's over.   I've missed you so much   Came out to watch you play.   Why are you running?"    Shroud-ing all the ground around me   Is this holy crow above me.   Black as holes within a memory   And blue as our new second sun.   I stick my hand into his shadow   To pull the pieces from the sand.   Which I attempt to reassemble   To see just who I might have been.   I do not recognize the vessel,   But the eyes seem so familiar.   Like phosphorescent desert buttons   Singing one familiar song...    "So good to see you.   I've missed you so much.   So glad it's over.   I've missed you so much.   Came out to watch you play.   Why are you running away?"    Prying open my third eye.        So good to see you once again.       I thought that you were hiding.       And you thought that I had run away.       Chasing the tail of dogma.       I opened my eye and there we were.              So good to see you once again       I thought that you were hiding from me.       And you thought that I had run away.       Chasing a trail of smoke and reason.      Prying open my third eye.

      What was it like to see The face of your own stability Suddenly look away Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?  Eleven and she was gone. Eleven is when we waved good-bye. Eleven is standing still, Waiting for me to free him By coming home.  Moving me with a sound. Opening me within a gesture. Drawing me down and in, Showing me where it all began,Eleven.  It took so long to realize that You hold the light that's been leading me back home.  Under a dead ohio sky, Eleven has been and will be waiting, Defending his light,And wondering... Where the hell have I been? Sleeping, lost, and numb. So glad that I have found you. I am wide awake and heading home.  Hold your light, Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step by inch by loaded memory. I'll move to heal As soon as pain allows so we can Reunite and both move on together.  Hold your light, Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step By inch by loaded memory'till one and one are one, Eleven So glow, child, glow. I'm heading back home.

      What's coming through is alive. What's holding up is a mirror. But what's singing songs is a snake Looking to turn this piss to wine.  They're both totally void of hate, But killing me just the same.  The snake behind me hisses What my damage could have been My blood before me begs me Open up my heart again. And I feel this coming over like a storm again. Considerately.  Venomous voice, tempts me,Drains me, bleeds me,Leaves me cracked and empty. Drags me down like some sweet gravity. The snake behind me hisses What my damage could have been. My blood before me begs me Open up my heart again. And I feel this coming over like a storm again.  I am too connected to you to Slip away, to fade away. Days away I still feel you Touching me, changing me, And considerately killing me.  Without the skin, Beneath the storm, Under these tears The walls came down. And the snake is drowned and As I look in his eyes, My fear begins to fadeRecalling all of those times.  I could have cried then. I should have cried then.  And as the walls come down and As I look in your eyes My fear begins to fade Recalling all of the times I have died and will die. It's all right.I don't mind.  I am too connected to you to Slip away, to fade away. Days away I still feel youTouching me, changing me, And considerately killing me.

      Something has to change. Un-deniable dilemma. Boredom's not a burden Anyone should bear. Constant over stimu-lation numbs me and I wouldn't have It any other way.  It's not enough. I need more. Nothing seems to satisfy. I don't want it. I just need it. To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive.  Finger deep within the borderline. Show me that you love me and that we belong together. Relax, turn around and take my hand.  I can help you change Tired moments into pleasure. Say the word and we'll be Well upon our way. Blend and balance Pain and comfort Deep within you Till you will not have me any other way.  It's not enough. I need more. Nothing seems to satisfy. I don't want it.I just need it. To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive.  Knuckle deep inside the borderline. This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to. Relax. Slip away.  Something kinda sad about the way that things have come to be. Desensitized to everything. What became of subtlety?  How can it mean anything to me If I really don't feel anything at all?  I'll keep digging till I feel something.  Elbow deep inside the borderline. Show me that you love me and that we belong together. Shoulder deep within the borderline. Relax. Turn around and take my hand.

But you're pushing me And Im shoving you And your pushing me And Im shoving you  Rest your trigger on my finger, Bang my head upon the fault line You better take care not to make me enter If I do we both may disappear  But you're pushing me And Im shoving you And your pushing me And Im shoving you  You still love me  We're pushing and were shoving And you're pushing and I'm shoving  You still love me  And were pushing and were shoving And I'm pushing as your shoving  And Im slipping back into the gap again I feel alive when you touch me... I feel alive when you hold me......down  Slipping back into you  I am somewhere I dont wanna be, yeah Put me somewhere I dont wanna be Push me somewhere I dont wanna be Seeing someplace I don't wanna see Never wanna see that place again...  Saw that gap again today While you were begging me to stay Managed to push myself away, And you as well, my dear  If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay, You minimize my movement anyway, I must persuade you another way  Pushing and Shoving and Pushing and Shoving and Pushing me  There's no love in fear.  Staring down the hole again. Hands are on my back again. Survival is my only friend. Terrified of what may come.  Remember I will always love you, As I claw your fucking throat away. It will end no other way.

      Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone Inside sleeping, my heart beating You know that you tried to hide it Couldn't you have said what you meant? Oh...  Time heals, time congeals around us Endless hours of wasted moments Understanding, not demanding Your eyes tell what you feel inside Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone Inside sleeping, my heart beating You know that you tried to hide it Shouldn't you have said what you meant?  YOU LIED!

      I have come curiously close to the end, down Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole, Defeated, I concede and Move closer I may find comfort here I may find peace within the emptiness How pitiful It's calling me...  And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping The moon tells me a secret - my confidant As full and bright as I am This light is not my own and A million light reflections pass over me Its source is bright and endless She resuscitates the hopeless Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting  And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt Don't wanna be down here feeding my narcissism. I must crucify the ego before it's far too late I pray the light lifts me out Before I pine away.  So crucify the ego, before it's far too late To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical, And you will come to find that we are all one mind Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable. Just let the light touch you And let the words spill through And let them pass right through Bringing out our hope and reason ...before we pine away.

      Black then white are all I see in my infancy. red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.lets me see. As below, so above and beyond, I imagine drawn beyond the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend.  Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind. Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I mustFeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.  Black then white are all I see in my infancy. red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. lets me see there is so much more and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities. As below, so above and beyond, I imagine drawn outside the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend.  Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind. Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind. Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.  Reaching out to embrace the random. Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.  I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected enough to step aside and weep like a widow to feel inspired, to fathom the power,to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain, to swing on the spiralof our divinity and still be a human.  With my feet upon the ground I lose myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin. I'm reaching up and reaching out, I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me. And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been. Spiral out. Keep going, going...

      Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity. Calculate what we will or will not tolerate. Desperate to control all and everything. Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down. Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end. Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down. Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.  Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again. Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end. Saturn ascends, comes round again. Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done.  Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity. Calculate what we will or will not tolerate. Desperate to control all and everything. Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control. Unable to forgive. And we're sinking deeper. Defining, confining, controlling, and we're sinking deeper.  Saturn comes back around to show you everything Let's you choose what you will not see and then Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.  Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child or Drags you down like a stone To consume you till you choose to let this go.  Give away the stone. Let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor. Give away the stone. Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold.  Let go.

      A groan of tedium escapes me,Startling the fearful. Is this a test? It has to be,Otherwise I can't go on. Draining patience, drain vitality. This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.  But I'm still right here Giving blood, keeping faith And I'm still right here.  Wait it out, Gonna wait it out, Be patient (wait it out).  If there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. Gonna wait it out.  If there were no desire to heal The damaged and broken met along This tedious path I've chosen here I certainly would've walked away by now.  And I still may ..... I still may. Be patient.  I must keep reminding myself of this.  And if there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. And I still may. Gonna wait it out.

      Suck and suck. Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck. Workin up under my patience like a little tick. Fat little parasite.  Suck me dry. My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards. You have turned my blood cold and bitter, beat my compassion black and blue.  Hope this is what you wanted. Hope this is what you had in mind. Cuz this is what you're getting. I hope you're choking. I hope you choke on this.  Taken all I can, taken all I can take. Taken all you can, taken all you can fuggin take Got nothing left to give to you. Blood suckin parasitic little tick Take what you want and then go.  Hope this is what you wanted. Hope this is what you had in mind. Cuz this is what you're getting.  Suck me dry. Is this what you wanted? Is this what you had in mind? Cuz this this is what you're getting. I hope you choke.

      Hey guess what? not to long ago the band got back together 2 jam again, and we used this sweet bass line i wrote so pretty soon sometime, were gonna have another song. its slower but awesome as heck! i haven't written in here in a while, but guess what? We're looking at moving somewhere into a different neighborhood cuz ours is slowly goin down the drain, so were gonna move across the freeway. Maybe to kellywood or Pinoak, i still am gonna go to Katy but just live somewhere else. Were going 2 try and get a house with an extra couple of rooms, one so i can put my guitar stuff in. Which is where then later i will run my own buisness right out of my own house, a studio. I'm slowly saving up. i just got a job at the polo store in the mall, so maybe ill have money, everyone works in the mall now. Kaitlyn, Kara, Staci, Olivia , Sil , and Jonny works right outside the mall at Fridays now. And my Neihbor works at The Los Cucos...mmmm...LOL....Yea ( mmm to the food too ) LOL....If yah know what im sayin LOL. But yeah Katie you need 2 go to one of our band practices "jam sessions, in the words of matt". LOL. im kind of wanting to back to school now, i know that sounds kinda dorky but i haven't seen so many people in forever, and it sucks because some of the incoming sophomores are going 2 Morton ranch h.s.&nbsp;&nbsp; like Katie baker.... &nbsp;: ( . But still anyways, im working on writting my own acoustic songs, i know i always say that but now i might as well cuz a while back i promised aimee i would write her a song and i never got around to it, and cuz i don't want her 2 lay a beat down on me, i thought id get started, cuz shes a Hoss. a hoss and a half. LOL. But yeah ill try and put more in as i can think of it later. Shea im going to jack your car and give you mine..... cuz i know you'll like mine a lot better...LOL jk. Funny story??? Ok.....Well&nbsp;i was&nbsp;playing basketball with Jake and Rudy and Blake m. And then we were all goofing around at the court in peckum park. And Jake kept kicking the ball straight up...And then the very next one....The ball launched up into the rafters and jams in the ceiling....And it was funny cuz it was his basketball....So he immediately goes...."ahhh" in the highest pitch squeal ever. And Rudy and Blake and i were cracking up cuz it was so randomly funny......Yeah i know....hah hah hah, not funny...well it would be if you were there! ahh hah! wow im kinda hungry so im gonna go fix me some lunch......it being three and i havent eatin yet...thad be a good thing huh? 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
