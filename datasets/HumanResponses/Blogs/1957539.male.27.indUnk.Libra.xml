      I just signed up with  urlLink Philippine Blog Awards .  Not like I have any chance of winning any awards, but I am hoping to get any publicity for my main Mazinkaiser site that I can.  Who knows, though?  There might be someone out there who finds that reading the output generated by the neurotransmitters in my brain is actually entertaining.  Yeah right, that and the Philippines will win the 2004 Olympic Gold Medal in Basketball with myself as head coach.  Now, what did I do today?  I got a haircut, for one thing.  With F4 hitting its stride as arguably THE fad of the year, it seems that everyone is dyeing and/or growing their hair long.  Call me conservative, but I can't stand long hair.  In the harsh Philippine environs, I view long hair as an attempt to look cool while compromising one's own comfort.  It's not that I'm sexist or something - I don't mind long hair per se.  I mean, Jesus Christ had long hair (arguably, based on the shroud of Turin...), but He also lived in a place where there is often a cool ocean breeze.  (I should know, I've been to Israel in 1999.)  Here in Manila, the only breeze one can rely on is the breezing by of rush hour jeepneys and taxis belching out their hopefully now lead free smoke.  I feel long hair and Philippine weather are so incompatible so as to make them mutually exclusive.  I wonder how ladies have endured the heat and humidity with all those tresses for all these years.  Then again, ladies also used to wear corsets.  (Pirates of the Carribean comes to mind.)  Maybe guys are the ones who used to be lazy in terms of fashion.  I don't know.

      Oh, I had forgotten to mention that they misspelled my name on my new jersey.  Tan-Gatue was spelled "Tan-Gataue".  Usually when my last name is mispelled, the "e" is replaced by something else, usually an s or an a.  This is the first time that Tan-Gatue was misspelled like this, though.  I'm going to have to find a way to remedy this.  The funny thing is, it shouldn't have to be.  Tan-Gatue is my great-grandfather's full name in the Fujian Chinese dialect.  The root surname is actually Tan.  I daresay Tan is a LOT easier to spell.  To save myself the trouble of having to spell it out everytime, I just call myself "Philip Tan" in minor situations like phoning for delivery.  Well, if this is the biggest problem of my life, then I'm one lucky SOB.

      We finally got our new uniforms for our high school alumni basketball league.  I like the designs very much!  They're modeled after the Detroit Pistons' road blues, except with the words "NINETYFOUR" emblazoned up front.  Now they want me to change my headband color to match Ben Wallace's.

      Okiedokie, now I'm going to compensate for almost a year of doing nothing with my blogger account.  Let's start by recreating some posts from the past blogs with other services I've tried.   urlLink Density Church International - Miracle Claimed at Density Church!   OOOOOOOOOkay, now I believe in miracles, but this is kind of stretching it a LOT.  Comment number 1: Usually in cases like this, God takes a more direct route and cures the blindness.  Comment number 2:  "According to Brian Tamariki, Colleen Shannon’s bumps clearly spell out the words “suck here” in Braille." That's a LOT of bumps to fit in a nipple.  Comment number 3: Even if it IS there in Braille, what use is it to a baby?  Comment number 4:  "The Shannons’ family doctor, Dr Ralph Wellhausen, confirmed there was medical support for the phenomenon. “It is true that the bumps on the areolae, or ‘Montgomery bumps’ as we call them, often become more pronounced following childbirth.” Despite this fact, Dr Wellhausen felt that the pattern could have merely been the result of “a quite natural random formation”. Pastor Brian denied Dr Wellhausen the opportunity to examine the areolae at the time of the alleged miracle, due to the doctor’s “lack of faith”." How can we call this a miracle then, if it can be explained scientifically?  Conclusion: This is not a miracle, but an insult to the intellect.  I am a Catholic Christian and proud of it, yet it is this kind of intellectual idiocy that makes non-believers make fun of us.

      Man, I never knew I'd end up back with Blogger.  I went from Blogger to Movable Type to Greymatter to Livejournal to Xanga to TBlog and now back to Blogger.  Back to Blogger and Blogspot.  But hey, they've improved a LOT.  Now they've got COMMENTS!  Only one more on the wish list - categories and sorting by them perhaps?

      After watching the movie  urlLink Down With Love , I am more than convinced that Ewan McGregor should be considered to play James Bond in the future.  In the film, McGregor exhibits his dapper side, strutting about in a tuxedo.  This is in contrast to his portrayal of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the more recent Star Wars movies.  In  urlLink Moulin Rouge!  he was a more sensitve type.  All in all, I believe that these various roles prove that McGregor can be the best James Bond since the original, Sir Sean Connery.  For the record, I think that the current incarnation (bastardization?) of James Bond, as portrayed by (ugh), Pierce Brosnan, is too "soft" to play a seasoned secret agent.  Of course, I admit my bias for Sean Connery's Bond.  I watched the James Bond movies in order from Doctor No onwards, and so Sean was the first Bond I had seen.  Hence, his 007 is THE 007 for me.  I understand that people who saw Roger Moore first prefer him, and that the current crop of moviegoers whose first taste of Bond was with Brosnan feel that his portayal is the quintessential one.  Still, my preference is my preference and I'm sure many people share it.  Sean Connery IS James Bond.  I just thought of another reason why I believe McGregor can be as good as Sean.  They're both Scottish.  Ha Ha.

       urlLink Toll fees at North, South expressways increased - Jul. 05, 2004   Looks like the new government is desparate for money.  The North Expressway fees aren't that bad, but the South ones are ridiculous.  At this rate, it'll take more than 120 pesos to go to Alabang.  I would just like to make the observation that fees are very expensive already, and this is just an additional burden.  And right after the inauguration yet!  An ominous sign?  Either way, it shows that the new six year term of Pres. Arroyo is not setting off on the right foot.  Then again, it's already tripped twice over the rising electricity rates and the rising gasoline rates.  If this is really a scheme to make more money for the government, I'm all against it.  I still say scrap the pork barrel for congressmen, lease government property (not sell), and trim the fat off the bloated government payroll.  That and stir-fry all corrupt government officials.  Only, there'd be no one left.

      Okay, we played our first game and my statline stunk.  Zero points, rebounds, assists, everything... in about two minutes of playing time.  Normally, that wouldn't matter to me, but we lost.  That puts everything in a different light.  At least my jumper's back.  Now if I could showcase it in more than just practice and pickup games.
