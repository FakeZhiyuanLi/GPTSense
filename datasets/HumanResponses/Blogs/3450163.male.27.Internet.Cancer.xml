      It's a pity CSI isn't really like what the Crime scene techs do.  I would love that job.  Here is to hoping the FBI results of phase II come out this week, I can't wait to see if I made it.  I really hope I did.

      I always hated those first post...postings.  Decided to set one of these up, even though I doubt I will see much activity.  It's a lot more satisfying to do it here then in some paper journal.  For anyone that does happen to stumble across...I'm 26 going on 27, just got out of the navy as an officer (LT) and am seeking employment, hopefully something federal/governmental.  I've been involved with computers since I was nine years old, even though I tend to shy away from web-things since I see them as a colossal waste of resources, usually.  How utterly ironic I made this then.  I'm going for my CISSP soon, with a friend sponsoring me.  I guess I should really start cracking on the books more.   Anyways, here is something to look at.  The Patriot Act.  Most people are quick to hop on the hype bandwagon about how "bad" it is, but riddle me this:  what were to happen if the United States never took any initiative to stop terrorism, violence, and dictatorship?  Who would?  France?  HAH.  Someone has to do it, and the US is the only one that will.  We are damned if we do, and damned if we don't.  http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html

      Will be optimizing that damn map server.  I'm not sure what can be done - yet.  I've only traced the code for the login server, and it makes me nauseous.  However, I am sure there are a few things that can be changed with judicious debugging.  Hopefully, we can eliminate some of the size and execution time of it.  First look will come as soon as the CVS repository is set up.  Stay tuned for more idiocy!   Edit:  Removed an item already.  Friends list has to stay broken until OA implements it serverside.  I MIGHT try and do it myself, but I am making no promises.

      As I study for CISSP, I have gone back to my roots - coding.  Right now, I am doing some optimizing of the omniathena engine for spyderlake ragnarok online.  A nifty little project to do on the side.  You can check out information on it at www.spyderlake.com  Hey, I always liked programming on my own!
