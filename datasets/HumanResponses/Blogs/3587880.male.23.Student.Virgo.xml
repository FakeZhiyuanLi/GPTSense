      It looks like the 22nd of August is the official start date for my year&nbsp;with Youth Encounter.&nbsp; I've got a ton of reading to do and a bunch of info that I have to digest before I can go onto the next step of things&nbsp; though.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was sent a CD ROM full of info on the organization and I need to go through it and fill out some more forms.&nbsp; Forms forms and more forms, that's the life of a prospective member of Team. (For those of you that don't know, "Team" is the short form for what I'll be doing this year.&nbsp; I imagine that I'll be using it frequently in the coming months as I get sucked into the jargon of a new living situation.)   No longer will it be the jargon of school and&nbsp;science, no mine will be the lingo of a Christian in a small community doing ministry.&nbsp; I say this with some sarcasm and even more dread because I hate it when people assume&nbsp;that I understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;language they're using when in reality I haven't got a clue and am just too confused to ask for clarification.&nbsp; Yeah I'm really looking forward to becoming  that&nbsp; guy :)

      After a 2 hour interview, reference letters, and a demo tape I found out yesterday that I'm going to be a part of   Youth Encounter's 2004-2005 season  .&nbsp; I have no idea where I'm going, who's on my team, or even when it starts but I'm going.&nbsp; That's really all matters.&nbsp; I'll find out in the next couple of days what's next in the process.&nbsp; They just mailed the info to me yesterday so it'll be a few days till it gets here.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Today I found myself running all over Regina trying to get things sorted out after yesterday. I got the passport thing taken care of, and I called the Y.E. office to ask a few questions. I set up an appointment to see my doctor for a medical, and worked a full day. When I got home I found my parents had done some checking into things so I knew all I needed to about health insurance and had a dentist appointment booked as well. All in all a good day.  Not too surprisingly I found myself on the Youth Encounter web site (if you're interested it's  urlLink  www  .youthencounter.org  ) today. I was looking around at some of the info about the bands from 2003-04 and started to wonder to myself "How would I feel if I were placed in the North central team?" There is a team in the North and South West, North and South central, central Great Lakes, Eastern Great Lakes, and North and South East. For as long as I've been thinking about doing this I've had a picture of being on the North East team, but what if I were placed on the North central team? It's just like home I'd imagine, flat dull, small towns and cities. Would I be disappointed? Would I develop a bad attitude about being there? Would I be jealous of those who were placed on the North East team?  To combat this I started reading one of the online journal entries from a member of the North central team. I didn't read too much, frankly I lost interest and there are times when I don't wonder if I don't have some sort of mild form of A.D.D., but I did read for a bit. What did strike me was that the person who was writing had a real joy about being there. She loved the people and didn't necessarily put too much emphasis on her physical surroundings. I was given pause to consider if I'd be able to do the same thing if I were in her shoes (because I might just be in a year). I think I need to spend some time asking God to give me a heart for the people that I'll encounter. I need to focus on them and not where ever I'll be posted. They're the real reason I'm going in the first place and He knows where I'll be used the most. I've got to trust that He's looking out for my best interests, that He'll teach me everything that He want me to know this year and that He'll arrange my posting so He can accomplish those two goals...Easier said than done though.

      Well after putting it all off for a while I decided to start doing some of the paperwork that I need to do. I was sort of stressed about my passport and whether it would come in time for me to leave the country, but when I got home from work today I found it was waiting for me, or so I thought. I opened up the package to find that they'd mailed it back to me unprocessed because the pictures I had given weren't right. My image on the photos was too small and there were shadows behind my ears which apparently isn't allowed. So with less than two weeks left I have to go get new pictures taken and request a rush job on the processing of my passport application. It's do-able but it's still one more stress that I'd prefer not to have experienced.  It doesn't seem like it's all only two weeks away. A week from Saturday (aka Aug. 21) at 6:00 I fly out of Regina for Minneapolis. I guess  "in a post Sept. 11th era"  I need to be at the airport three hours early for international flights, so I'll be there at the boring old Regina airport at 3:00 in the morning. I didn't know it was even open that early. Oh well!  So even though it's fast approaching I'm not really taking it seriously. I mean I've sold my car in order to take care of my student loans for the year, and I've put together the list of potential supporters that they've asked me for, but other than that it doesn't really feel like it's going to happen. Then one day I'll wake up on the floor of an American church and I'll be there and it'll be underway. It still doesn't feel real yet.
