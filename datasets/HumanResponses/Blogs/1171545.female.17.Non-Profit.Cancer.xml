      Well, here I am. I'm blogging. I'm typing a message. I'm blabbering about the nonsense that is my life. Lets see, where do I start...  My mom comes home tonight or tomorrow. She left last thursday with her fiancee and her family and flew to the caribbean to spend a week on 'The Galaxy' ship. Sounds like paradise, doesnt it? Well, while she's off burning her skin and bathing in the crystal-blue water of Grenada, i'm at home. Hell. Ok, it's not THAT bad. But the house is a disaster area. It's like a bomb has been dropped and the inhabitants have taken cover and not revealed themselves. No one is doing anything. The dishes are done, however, by my grandpa. He's an awesome guy and i love him more then anything, but he isn't the best house-keeper. Then again, neither are my brothers. Not even I keep up the best house-hold - but i have been! If my mom comes home to this house, she'll have a heart-attack. So I'm spending today cleaning, vaccuming and dusting. Thankfully, i've talked my brothers into cleaning the basement. Afterall, they practically LIVE down there. I'm just praying it all goes well and everything works out.   There are some good outcomes to my moms trip...She took my video camera! So she'll have awesome video and I get gifts! That's kewl and i'm sort of excited about that.   R A W R  Yeh. I started second semester on monday. I have Art first period. My art teacher is a free-spirit and she's really whacky, but everyone swears she's on crack. I don't think it's true, but i wouldnt put it past her. She is an odd-one, but i guess that's required in such an artistic setting. We're starting a project where we paint objects. She gave my a bicycle helmet, because i couldnt find anything i wanted to paint. We have to copy a painting, which sorta takes away from the creativity inside of me, but that's ok. I found a kewl painting.  Second period, I have Law. I have a good story about this class, but i'll get to that in a minute. This is my biggest class and I almost didn't get into it! But I did, and it's boring..but it's better then taking Outdoor Education (Evil.) I sit at the back of the class, beside my friends. But there is this guy in my class named Colin. I'm not sure whats wrong with him, but he isn't..shall we say, Normal. He's a loser. Before you go - OH MY GOODNESS! ALISON! HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT SOMEONE - let me explain.   Colin cries. screams. kicks. punches. and says 'for petes sake' A LOT. He'll be quiet and smart one moment, and throwing his books and desk/chair the next. If you anger him, he'll get after you. For example, someone threw an apple at him in the hallway and he spun around, threw his books on the ground and SCREAMED at the top of his lungs.."LEAVE ME ALONE!' Then, he turned to me and slammed his fist against my locker and kicked it, and started screaming at me. (His locker is beside mine.)   Since that event, i've been terrified of this kid. He is scary, and it's sad to say that.   Anyway, third period..I have 16th century history. This is my smallest class and it's not that bad. It's rather interesting, and like Law, we watch a lot of movies. Right now we're stuck on human evolution, which isnt exactly 16th century. I keep saying we should watch gladiator and have a dual on chariots or something. It's better then learning about..'The pelvis bone of the homo erectus was larger, to support his heavy internal organs.' give me a BREAK!  Lastly, i have BTA. This is the boring class. It's almost unbearable, i swear. We are learning about Microsoft word, Microsoft power-point. It's so flippin' easy. I almost have to fall asleep. Anndd, to make things worst? Colin is in that class! First day of school, he saw beside me at my computer because his wasnt working. I scrolled down a little to fast and he started to cry and threw his fist down on the table. Heh...heh..scary! But the teacher made him move, thank-god.   Yep. That's just a jumble of my classes. What else can I say? Oh.  I can't wait till the summer. It's a good thing that this is last semester, because I couldn't bare being in first. This summer is going to be a blast! I'm so excited about it. Newbrunswick, Wonderland, Bowmanville, Trenton, Whitby..i'm gonna make my rounds! It's crazy. I'm gonna go horse-back-riding and hopefully i'll have some money to spend. I want to buy a kewl bathing suit and some nifty sunglasses. It's going to rock. I'm supposed to be picking up guitar lessons when my moms fianceés friend gets back from Afghanistan or Iraq, wherever he may be. Ofcourse, he's been saying that since christmas. I'm getting a bit impatient.   My fish is cute. He's still blue, but he's slowly turning red. I'm not sure if this is normal, but then again..he isnt a normal fish. What kind of fish forgets to breathe..or spits his food out? He's a weird one, but i love him to death. He's almost 2 months old, which is sad..I'm not sure how old they live. I love my Pippin :)  Yep..So i think i've blabbered enough for today. Infact, this is rather addicting and i'll probably do another entry tonight. When my fingers arent aching.   RAWR P.S I miss you Emirly..:P -hugs- -Alison

      I'm at school. I figured, since im to sick and tired to do any REAL work, that i'd blabber on my blog for awhile.  You know what I don't get? When I used to have the urge to sneeze, people would say 'PICKLE!' and i was so thankful for that. Now, when i suggest to someone to say it here, where i now live, and try to hold in my sneeze at the same time, they're like...Pickle? Where?! Some people...  I have to minimize this window a lot. It's getting rather annoying. Though I tend to brave the chance of having the BTA teacher catch me typing something, i do know when to minimize. I'm done my business report anyway, so I have nothing else to do at the moment. (That's a lie, by the way.)  THIS KEYBOARD SUCKS, the spacebar refuses to move and therefore, i must type slow..how stinkish..  So, my nose has been running all day..it's really horrible. Me and my friend Ashlee have concluded that 'Halls Fruit Breathers' make your throat feel better, but they make you cough more. Regular Halls on the other hand, make your cough go away but they make your throat hurt. Though people might not agree with this, they should know that it's true.  :-D  So, my mom finally got back from her cruise. We watched the video they taped while they were there. Me and my brother Andrew were freaking out at them. We're so jealou of them and all we can talk about now is saving money for a cruise. They did bring back some kewl stuff though. Aside from the coral bits and countless sea-shells, i got a 'lazy-kitten' t-shirt, a happy-face-sun ring that goes from clear to bright orange outside, 3 cocoa-bean-necklaces, a shark-tooth and a key-chain. Oh, and i can't forget my Pirates of the Caribbean flag. I'm glad, in many ways, that she's back. I mean, i can finally go to bed without worrying about things. . .(Is the stove off? are the doors locked?) But on the other hand, my mom and her fiancee just depress me. I'm so depressed when they're around me. It's sad and only confirms that I, Allie, require a vacation.   So - what else can I say? It's only 2:07pm, i still have 43 minutes left. Oh, would anyone like to know a crazy movie? Rat Race. That movie is crazy-funny. I laugh at everything. Even the starting, where the credits come up! I think i'm going to rent 'Once upon a time in Mexico' and watch that again. It's so great.   This weekend, i talked to some guy named Dave. He's a friend of my friends boyfriend. He's hilarious and he says GROOVY a lot. He did say some weird things..such as...  'Johnny Depp is the man' 'Yeh...' 'Johnny Depp is hott!' '......Yeh' 'I'm not gay' 'Ok...' 'I'm just so confident with my sexuality that i can admit another man is good-looking'  It was funny, no matter what you say. Then he continued...  'I got Johnny Depps autograph' '...No you didnt!' 'I did' 'I'm going to steal it from you' 'Yeh, that's gonna be hard my dear, seeing as i keep it on my 'p*nis' '.....Ok'  Yeh, it was weird. Shirley, my friend, told me he was doing all this on purpose. I knew he was, considering she and her boyfriend were sitting there edging him on. It just seems like something they'd do. It was, none the less, amusing. Anyway, yeh. What else..It's 2:18pm. Emily, you're gonna have a lot to read.   So i've been trying to think of stuff I want to do this summer and i'm going to make a list. I know I'm going to NewBrunswick for atleast 2weeks. I also know i'm going to Wonderland and possibly Niagra Falls. I have plans to go visit my friends in Trenton, Belleville,Stirling. I also have plans to go visit family in Bowmanville. I want to go horse-back-riding and water-tubing and I also want to go to the rapids by the golf-course. I hope to have my guitar-teacher back from Afghanistan and I want to get my ears pierced. I'm going to work on a movie and hopefully fly a kite(Weeee!) and above all else, i want to have the best damn summer EVER!   I have a craving now, to talk about something stupid. I know, by reading this, that you'll be like..ok,you're a dork alison. But hear me out!  There is a game that I'm addicted to called 'Ultima Online.' It's a very awesome game. Infact, I have some screen-shots to show you before I explain it. (These pictures aren't from the shard that I play, by the way)        (RAWR! This last one is funny..) I'll try and get some screen captures from the shard that I play because they're much more interesting. This game is basically like a puppet show. You are the puppet-master and you control your puppet. You can your character skills, armor, spells, books, candles, horses, houses..it's like..you're living in these days! It's a roleplaying game, if nothing else. Anyway, this shard I play is called 'Alter Realms of time' (Shards are basically another name for a world. I actually created my own shard, but it didnt work out.) Anyway, on a shard, there are usually Admins and Game-masters. These are the people who control the shard(Make sure people arent breaking rules or swearing, ect. because you can talk in real-time, making your characters say everything.) On our shard, we have two really kewl gms. They are the kewlest. Me and a bunch of my internet friends play this shard and we're always together on it. Well, lately..'Admin'(He hosts the shard and owns it, basically.) Has been being a big knob and he's tearing down our beloved shard and making a new one. This is interesting, but we have to start all our characters over again! (It takes along time to build your characters skills, get items, horses, money.) He doesnt want anyone telling anyone else about this new shard, fearing that people will leave it. It's getting really depressing, but it shouldnt be, because it's a friggen game. A lot of my friends have left because of him and his 'new shard idea' Hopefully,  they all come back and everything goes back to normal. IT'd be nice. Anyway, now it's..2:51pm and I should probably get going. I havent got anything else to say right now except..SNEEZING SUCKS, when the room is silent. :P   -Allie

      Today is a good day. You may ask, how can ANY weekday be a good day? Well..it's rather simple actualy. Today, i'm in this computer lab for three periods! That's..along time. It's almost lunch time, so this won't be an incredibly long entry. I hate history BTA after lunch, then i have history in here. It's pretty kewl actually. I like using the internet.  I got myself a new shirt from zellers. Yeh, it's not the best quality..but it's got a vintage mickey mouse on the front! It's really spiffy. It wont fit me in a month though, because i'm gonna be 10lbs lighter. better believe it.  So..if anyone out there follows 24, you know..that show? Well, last night was the show of all shows..JACK SHOT NINA! YAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY! I've been waiting for 2 years, almost, just to see that scene. I've seen every episode..and that was the greatest moment. I HATED HER. She stunk.  well..i better go..im gonna sit here till the bell rings..yay?  -Allie (P.S My word, for today, is.. Fanny feathers.) hehehe

      So here I am again..Impressive, right? Sure it is! I hardly ever used to enter anything i'm my blog..and look! TWICE IN ONE DAY. Yep. I'm impressed. So, i just finished doing a map for BTA. It was really easy, i'm just waiting for it to print..Infact, I've been waiting for 5 minutes. Oh, there, it printed. Now, i'm done working for today! I have 20 minutes left of school and I can't wait till I get home.   What to say..what to say..I love my life at this very second of the day. Like, I can't sit here and think of many things that i hate. Well, i can, but i'm not. I have this thing, like a few people already know, with guys. No, it's not the regular..Ohmygodhessohot kinda thing. It's more of a..He'd be an awesome brother! HOLD IT! I know that you're thinking. Alison, you're a nut. This, in all, is very true - However - you need to know the entire story. My dad left us at a very young age. He literally came home from work, said he was leaving, packed his stuff and left an hour later. He cheated, lied and decieved my mom and overall, he did all this to us aswell. I remember everything though..Every second of that day, and it's still haunting me. RAWR - Anyway..because my dad was absent for most of my life, i never really had an "OLDER male" in my life. I always wanted an older brother, especially when i was getting beat up in grade 5 and 6, but i never got one. Well NOW I have a few people who love me like a sister, who are older then me and who are willing to throw themselves infront of the bullet for me. I think that's the greatest thing I could ever ask for..Don't ask why, i'm just like this. :) I'm odd. but ya gotta love me, right?  Yeh, the only problem with this stuff is..my older siblings all live so far away now, because of my mom and her obssession with military posting. It's sad..but i get to go see Marc and Stephanie this summer! YAY! :D  . . . . . . . . .  Don't ask why I did that..I just..did. Well, im gonna go..I have like 10 minutes left and nothing interesting to say.  -Allie

      So I've decided to scribble for a bit. It's 9:35am, way to early for me. Actually, if this was saturday, I'd still be sleeping! But no, i'm sitting at a computer in art class. Don't ask. I've got to finish painting my object, which i havent started yet. :D RAWR.  So, i'm listening to my burnt c.d with my headphones. Right now? It's Edwin McCain, I'll be. It's a nice song..makes me happy! Next song is My Immortal by Evanescense. After that? It's Stacey's Mom! hehehe   For some reason, I'm in a good mood. I'm not sure why, i mean..it's only tuesday! This weekend will be nice, because..it's the weekend! Who doesn't love the weekend? I need new socks, pronto. My feet are freezing. May-day. May-day. Yes, i'm a dork.   I'm rambling about nothing, whatever my fingers feel like typing is what you're seeing. I'm not even looking at the computer screen, nor the keyboard..it's all them! I SWEAR!  So, my friend Ashlee said I was insane and i needed a mental institution. I agree with her, but she didnt have to tell me in the tone she did. My army of pidgeons, the sniper chickadee and the white-wing crow were all lingering around! I could have sent them on her, but decided she didnt deserve that much torture.  This is seriously funny. When I was desribing the order of songs i was listening too, i was just guessing..but they are actually in that order, that's funny. Yeh..people are staring at me..they're onto me! THEY KNOW!   I'm rushing. This march break is coming so fast. I'm going to have NO time to get everything ready. I need to lose weight! LIKE 10lbs! (Everyone is saying I dont, but I REALLY DO!) Then, i need to buy a bathing suit..sunglasses..capris..t-shirts..a few books to read on the 25 hour journey..batteries for my discman..a new towel? Yeh, why not! OH MAN - I need sandals! OH yeh, and i need other stuff..like my camera..and my video camera..lol I'm SO excited to go to florida! It's going to be so much fun. I mean, i dont know Jessica that well anymore, but we're still friends..we're like sisters who havent seen each other for along time. It's kewl that she wants me to go though. We're going to the same hotel we always went to! and hopefully, if everything goes as planned, charlie and rose will be there..! :D So now it's 9:44am..I have 20 minutes till I go to Law class. I didn't do my homework, sucks huh? Ohwell, can't get everything done. Wish I could..Oy, this song is kewl..Megalomaniac by Incubus. Mesa Like, RAWR.  Well, I guess I should stop typing and go surf the web a bit. :) I'll post later, when i actually have something intelligent to say. -Allie

      I've realized accidents happen, but sometimes, ACCIDENTS SUCK! Long story, i won't get into it. On a better note, however, i've started my lord of the rings fanfic! So far, it's not bad. Infact, just for Emily, I'll post what i have so far..(I'm also posting this on here so that I may copy and paste it on my own computer at home..School computers suck anyawy.) This story will be fixed and manipulated, no doubt, but this chapter isnt that bad.   -------------   The sky was clear and the clouds faintly fluffy. It hadnt rained in a fortnight and everything was nicely tainted with warmth. The soft muttering of sheep and the distant laughter of other hobbits filled the atmosphere, intermingling with the moist air that settled over the shire this lovely afternoon. There was something happening in the market. Besides being packed with busy hobbits who rushed around, halting to chat to any familiar face they may come across, many out-of-town folk from Hard-bottle and Willow bottom had brought stands to town. They were selling things. Though it wasnt anything spectacular, many hobbits gushed at the chance to snatch up something from another part of the shire. There was, however, one hobbit who wasnt attending the festivities. In fact, many would wonder if she even realized it was taking place. Siniver Took was settled comfortably in the long grass, leaning back gently on the corner-slope. She had concealed herself there, having lost herself in an occupation early in the morning. She was clad in a pair of tanned overalls that matched nicely with her mauve shirt. Her sleeves were rolled up at the elbows and her overall hems were folded up just above her ankles. Her hair was a tangled mass of curls, done up in a messy bun, wisps and strands torturing her pale face. It fit her nicely though, allowing those bright green eyes to peer out with all curiosity. She often got herself in trouble with her eyes, but it was all worth it in the end. In her hands was a book. This book, whatever it was, had her full attention. She stared at it feverishly, unable to tear her eyes away for the worn pages. If the day continued like this, there wouldnt be a problem. Right?  Wrong. She could hear them faintly, sifting through the grass, crushing each blade momentarily as it moved. She didnt care though, not right now. In fact, she passed it off as one of the many sheep who stalked around her. She went back to reading, soaking in every detail when suddenly it hit her  literally.   ACK!   The figure slammed a foot into her mid-section, catching it between her and the ground. This movement, unfortunately, caused the individual to fall over her and roll a couple feet on the opposite side. She let out a gasp, dropping her book into the grass and grabbing her side in pain. With a sour expression lingering over her face, she glared at the individual, who turned around suddenly and held his forehead. It was odd, really, how fast his pained expression left and a smile stole his features after that.  Siniver! Ive found you!   Yes, you did Pip.  Siniver offered him a smile, rubbing her side gently. When she had re-arranged herself in the grass, she snatched up her book and began to read those worn pages again. Pippin sat in the grass, supported by his hands and knees. Silence overwhelmed the situation and Pippin gaped at her. His face, having held such a surprised expression for so long, suddenly curled into one of shock.   Siniver, have you blinked in the last hour?  She shrugged off his comment, turning the page of her book quickly. Pippins concern was only short-lived. He quickly reached over and gathered up the brown bag he had dropped in his tumble and he dug his hand into it, withdrawing an object.   HA! Ok, it's not a lot. But it's enough for now. I havent got all day to write anyway..  Sheesh, my teacher is lingering around and she totally knows i'm not doing work. Ohwell, neither is anyone else really..So it's all good. Well..i'm off..gotta go to history..then i gotta go home! Then to the gym..then to the shower..Rawr, rawr! lol  -Allie

      So today is Thursday. It's not Friday - but Thursday. I hate Wednesday. Where that came from, I do not know. All I know is i'm staying home after lunch tomorrow because of that darn winter carnival which i didn't sign up for. >:)  I'm in Law right now and i'm not doing my work. I'm supposed to be looking up something on Equal Rights with African Canadians. I was going to do Gays/Lesbians, but i figured I should spare myself the stares and gasps. Not that there is anything wrong with being gay, of course. It's perfectly natural to me.   Marqui is sitting behind me and he's making really funny sounds.......He's scaring me.  Anyhoo.. what to say.. what to say.. I wonder if anyone even reads this..Hellloooo... is there anyone alive out there? heh..heh.. Titanic moment.   I'm going to my friends party this weekend. She's going to have three cakes, chips, popcorn, pop and chocolate and we're watching crazy movies all night long.. it might be fun! I'm not sure what i'm going to get her yet.. weird, huh?   I have to pick my courses for grade 12 by tomorrow.. My mom and I are gonna do that tonight.. should be interesting.. The way this place has the course selection set up is so stupid, i hate it so much. You have four boxes and they're labeled A, B, C and D. In each box are a selection of a couple course codes and you browse through the book and you HAVE to pick one of those courses. It's so incredibly dumb, because if you dont like those courses, you're sorta screwed.. Ohwell, I plan on using both my spares and a 2 period co-op.. so it's all good. If I can make it, im trying for a very easy last semester in grade 12.. If i can make it, i'll have.. Art, Spare, 2-period co-op. That'd be so easy. First semester, i'd take up 3 classes and use a spare again.. that'll ruin my chances at university though, so i'll have to think about it.   Marqui just went after Matt.. running down the hallway.. hehe.. that's funny.  Well.. better go.. do work.. Yeh..  -Allie

      So.. This hasn't been a very exciting day.. Infact, If I could curl up in a hole and stay there till next thursday, I'd be the happiest person in the world. I don't have much to say.. I just felt like posting something.. I'm actually going to use the next 40 minutes and attempt a webpage layout.. so, yeh.. School sucks. Long live Rock and Roll.. I like cheese..

      Why must the day go by so friggen slowly? I swear, first period (Art) was total slow-motion. I could hardly keep my eyes open. I finished the sketch that was due today however. It's a water-dragon.. it's really spiffy. We're in Law now and Ashlee, Kacey and I are supposed to be working on a project. I feel really bad, because they're doing more then me, but ohwell..   Marqui is sitting behind me, playing with a music program. He's trying to make music for.. music. :P It sounds strange. but.. it's entertaining.  La, La, La.. So! I bought my bathing suit for Florida. This weekend I'm going to buy some sunglasses and sandals and maybe a few more things. My friend Janis is giving me a bag of magazines to read on the way to florida. It's awesome, because that way.. I wont go bored! Also, I'm taking my video camera.. so we're going to make a video diary thing.. It should be very entertaining. I bought a new book too.. It's called 'Eragon.'  Anyhoo. What else can I say.. I'm bored and I want to go home.. NOW. lol School sucks muchly.. especially with cramps. I started a diet thing, so i can lose some weight before I go to florida.. It sucks though, because i can't eat anything but cabage soup. It's really depressing.. But OHWELL.. It's only for 7 days.. :)  Wellp.. I'm done for now, since i havent got much to talk about..   (Don't tax my gig so hardcore cruster..) -allie

      Well, where do I start? Howdy! Today is April 23rd, and I'm tired. This is nothing new, but I figured I'd cure some curious minds and post about the nonsense that is my life. Today is Friday, thank god. My week went O.K I guess. I'll tell you about it. Ready? Good.  Monday - Woke up early. Tired. Grumpy. Went to school. Went home. Went to gym. Hurt my legs.  Tuesday - Woke up early. Tired. Grumpy. Went to school. Went home. Went to gym. Hurt my legs.  Wednesday - Woke up early, but NO school! We went to the Ottawa Art Museum and well, had an interesting day. Let me tell you about it.  Well.. We got at the museum about 10am and we had our buddies picked out and everything. I was with Kacey, her sister and another girl. Well, the first hour was fun. We walked through the exhibits, looked at..paintings. Laughed at the statues with little dinkies.. (Don't ask) anndd.. we just laughed at stuff and made jokes. It was fun. well, then we had lunch around 11:30 and realized no one else was eating. For the next 2 hours, we saw no one - not even the teachers! so we went and sat down, praying that three oclock would come around FAST because we were hot, tired, soar and VERY, VERY bored after seeing each exhibit atleast 8 times.. I NEVER WANT TO SEE TOM THOMPSON AGAIN. So we went and sat in a sketches room and bought 25 cent chocolate M&Ms and drank pop, making outrageous stories, etc. It was fun.. For example - OMG! A PAINTING WAS STOLEN AND A BOMB WAS DROPPED AND EVERYONE DIED BUT THERE WAS LOTS OF ICECREAM! lol So sad..  but so funny at the time. Then we SAW SOMEONE! A grade nine named Robert, who we adopted into our group. He told us how he was looking at the million dollar painting and he stepped over the metal bar and 6 security guards went after him. hahahaha.. yeh, so anyway.. around 2:40, everyone came back. turns out.. THEY ALL WENT SHOPPING.. thats right folks, SHOPPING. WAit, it gets better.. even the TEACHERS went shopping. Turns out, they couldnt TELL us we could go because if something happened to use, they would have got sued. unbelievable. So yeh, then i slept on the way home. It was interesting, needles to say.  Thursday - Woke up early. Went to school. Left at Lunch. Went to Ottawa AGAIN. Saw Stepdad. Hugged. Left. Slept.  And then there is today, nothing much has happened yet.. Ugg.. yeh..  So.. havent got much else to say.. except.. rawr, rawr, rawr, i want an electric.. NOW and i love Johnny Depp. heheheheh! Byeeesss      -Allie

      YAY! TGIF! I've waited all week for today.. After school, I'm jumping in the shower, drying my hair, straightning it, eating supper and going to Krista's house! rawr! me, janis, kacey, candice, and a few other people are going to camp at krista's.. but only me and Janis are staying overnight. Spiffy huh? Yeh, it's gonna kick arse. I'm not gonna get into any alchohol though, if it appears like last time. Bad news for me anyway.   Ugg.. I have a history test in 20 minutes. I'm really nervous about it, but I think I'll do okay. ;)  So.. on Saturday, I'm headed to Ottawa again to see my stepdad. HE CAN TALK NOW! I'm so friggen excited. I want to go see him really bad. When I get back on saturday, i'm going to roleplaytill 2:00am.. and then watch The Last Samurai till 4am or so.. should be interesting. and I can be certain I wont be moving around on sunday. lol sleep in till 7:00pm.  Anyone watch the finale of friends? I cried. I pouted. I hated saying goodbye.. but it was such a good episode!

      Well, today is defiently a slow day. I hate Thursday. Yeh, I hate Monday and Wednesday too! Just can't escape them.. Friday, well, Friday is another story. Friday is a blessing. I spend every day and night just praying for Friday to hurry the hell up.. I did another count today, and I officially have 22 SCHOOL days left. (This is cutting out weekends, May 24 weekend and exams)   I only have three exams this semester! RAWR! I get to do my BTA exam in class.. which is totally awesome. I still have to write my Law, History and Art exam in the crowded, stinky, sweaty gym. Uggg. Why can't the technical stuff here, be anything like Bayside? That is one reason WHY I miss Bayside.   Well, I must admit - I feel pretty forgotten. Not just by my friends at Bayside, but by all my friends.. I considered becoming a hermit and just hiding in my house all day, but figured i'd just become a BIG flubberish ball of goo and my goal, at this moment, is to be thin enough to fit into American Eagle clothes, which i personally love. Especially the skirts! >  So.. Yes.. I need to start working on my stocks. I'm so behind, and I'll probably fail them.. Doh..    Well, havent got much else to say.. I need to go to history and die of complete boredome, melt from the heat, die from the powerful scent of burnt, run-down computers that threaten to explode.. and work on a BIG project. Fun, fun   -Allie

      It sucks, you know? I have a problem. A big problem. If I see something I like.. If I do something I like.. I will focus all my thoughts on that specific thing! For example.. I saw Troy last Sunday.. Here, a week later, I'm still obssessed! Today, I went into a helicopter at 427 Squadron for the first time.. I LOVEED IT and ever since I got home, I haven't talked about anything else.. you see where I'm coming from? I'm obssesive! It's starting to disgust even myself.. But ohwell, can't change myself overnight - right?  So I'm sitting here.. my mom is cooking sausages and stuff for supper.. I'm blaring my music, and drinking a Sprite Remix. I got a free hamburger at the 427 Squadron today.. it was goood. I think I'll tell you about my helicopter ride..  Well, we were briefed by Cpl. Lane, an FE. After that, we waited for helicopter 4.. It landed, and with nothing but the roar of the wind and chop-chop of propellars, I followed him onto the runway. He got everyone else out, and me and a few other people climbed in. I took the side seat, wanting to be able to look outside. After our seatbelts were double checked, we got the thumbs up and we were off.. I can't explain the feeling.. It's not like a plane at all, infact.. it's like nothing I've done before.. The drop-zone is a close bet, but only the helicopter was more comfortable.. We flew around for 20 minutes. There were head-phones, and i put them on. You could hear the pilot's talking, and the 'roger'roger' thing they do.. and then, he glanced over his shoulder and talked to me! AHHHH... He was so KEWL! Ever seen 24? The show on FOX? You know the character 'Chase' ? That's what he looked and sounded like! He asked me if I could hear him, I nodded. He then laughed and asked if I was having fun. I nodded. Then he goes.. HOLD ON! And he dove down towards the ottawa river.. GOD DAMNIT! my ears popped, but god.. it was the greatest experience.. I can't wait till the next family day! Hehehehehehehehehehehehe...   Anyway, yeh.. I'm beginning to reconsider my career.. Im thinking the military might not be so bad afterall.. I could be a photographer, and be retired when I'm 37! That's not a bad deal, if you think about it..  Yeh, off to think..  Toods.  -Allie

      ZzZzzZzzzzZzZzz...  Oh, if only I could do that! I can't stop thinking! Think, think, think.. it's all I friggen do! Sometimes.. I wish I was brocoli, yeh, that's right - brocoli. Then maybe I wouldn't think, or I could just get into the odd vegetable state..   I need to complain..  1. I can't stop yawning! Everytime I do, my eyes water up.. ugg..  2. I'm tired.. can't stop thinking 3. I'm.. bored  Damnit, I shoulda went to the coffee house :( Tony was playing.. and he did 'I believe in a thing called love' by the Darkness.. Ugg.. One of my favourite songs sung by the guy I'm totally crushin' over.. He doesn't even know that either, he probably never will.. Grr.. DAMN my stubborness!  So.. my brother is playing X-Box. He won't stop! I want to watch a friggen movie.. Cats and Dogs is on.. and so is the Shawshank Redemption.. I want to watch Shawshank more then the other, and probably could if I sat downstairs, but it's to cold..   So now I'm sitting here listening to music.. Nelly Furtado's 'Forca', Default's 'Live a lie', Nicklebacks 'Feelin' way too damn good', The Darkness' 'I believe in a thing called love..', Lifehouse's 'hangin' by a moment' beyond other things.. Damn I love my music, it kicks arse..   Yeh, i just heard the door open, and my cat walk out.. but, yeh.. i'm insane, so it's all good..  Yeehh.. so.. not much else to say, someone shoot me.. fast-forward the next 8 days, make school go away! gark..  Ok, i'm off.. gonna.. sit here some more.. toods     -Allie

      'Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel.. My hearts in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel!'  Lalalalala...  'I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart!'  Oh boy.. yeh, I'm okay. I'm in a good mood! I'd be in a better mood if I had something to read at the gym when I go, but ohwell. So I've been working on my webpage a lot. Spiffy eh? Yeh. It's pretty crazy.. I've added like, a big list of my friends with pictures.. I still need to add like, 50 more!  Http://www.geocities.com/ShadedGuitarGeek/Main.html  Yeh. Well. Week and three days of school left..

      So I painted a picture.. It's a flower.     Nifty, aye? Yeh, it took me two hours.. I sat in my room, blared my music and watched my fish, Pippin, swim around. I used my watercolor set and one of my remaining canvas's and painted away.. I dabbed it with kleenex to get the leaf-effect.. Not that you can really see it.. Meh, yeh.. and behind the painting is my floor, what a nice floor.. Since we're on the topic of pictures, here's another.. My guitar! Hello, Guitar!       It's Paris! Yes, my acoustic has a name... When I get my hands on my first electric, his name will be.. well, lets see.. Oh! Spartan! :D  So yeh.. I'm sitting here, considering my bed.. I really do need to sleep, but i'm thinking about my movie.. How the HECK am I going to do it.. Meh, i'll figure it out this summer, when my mind isn't stuck on school and exams.. Yeh, so.. i'm going to bed. Night. Toodles. Rock on.      -Allie

      Well, three days.. Yes, three days till it ends. I was thinking about it yesterday, and I'm not sad at all. I'm not sure why.. maybe because this was my first year at this school, maybe because outside my close group of friends, i dislike almost everyone minus a dozen. I should be sad.. My favourite teacher is gone next year. Many of the people I DO like are leaving, and I'll probably be leaving after grade 12.. going to Toronto or Oshawa, to college or university. It's sorta scary, actually.. to think about. I'll miss my friends, but we don't all live THAT far away. Sure, Janis and Krista are a 15 minute drive away, but that shouldnt be a problem. We've got all these plans.. Like, swimming in the rapids! Camping! Movie Theater! Sleeping In! DVD Parties! Pizza Parties! Kacey's Pool! We're also going to shoot my film, once I can convince them to be on camera.. Want to hear about it? I've got many ideas, but this one seems to work out for the moment. Depending on how many allow themselves to be an actress/actor, they're each going to be a character.. maybe an alchoholic? a love-struck fool? a jock? a rock-star? They'll get to pick out their own theme song, and all these stories will eventually merge into one, and everyone will be together.. It's got more to it, but this is just a rough draft of the idea, a short film.. If it works, I'll enter it into the film festival next year.   I can't wait till exams are over though. I have three, but this wednesday coming i'll write my BTA exam. I'm writing my Law Exam on Friday and my History Exam on Monday. Shouldn't be that bad.. Rather nervous, considering I haven't studied yet. I told myself it wouldnt be a repeat of last year and the night before study jam. That was horrible, and stressful. Oy.   Well, not much else to say.. I'm rather bitter at the moment, and really need a shower. Toodles.  Words of the Day:  'Here's the pitch.. Hobbit on Hobbit.'   'I don't.. understand?'

      It's gone. It just sailed away. I'm watching it disapear into the distance. It won't ever return. I feel like Samwise Gamgee as he watches his friends sail away at the end of Return of the King.. Helpless, abandoned, deserted, alone.. I want to rush forward, cling to them, never let them go.. Get ready for the longest blog I've ever written..   Most would jump for joy at the mention of 'School's Out!' I, Alison, was once one of those people, until last week. Don't get me wrong.. There ARE good aspects of not having school. You can stay up late, sleep in late, wear whatever you want. You don't need to do any homework, study or keep an organized binder. You're away from the judgement of your knowledge, and the road to the future.. It's a nice break, but with it comes a sacrifice. In grade 11, it took me awhile to get adjusted. I'd just been snatched from my natural habitat, torn away from my friends.. shipped off like a fragile package and thrown visciously into a new place. I felt so alone.. It took me a bit, but I did get adjusted. I got into a routine, found a place to belong.. I found my friends.. Janis, Krista, Josh, Kacey, Caleb, Dustin, Kate, Candice, Matt, Gneid.. and I found my first real crush.. I know most of them will be there next year, but it's the fact that I won't see them everyday, laugh with them, or just.. have a social life with them.  It's not all over, I realize. I mean.. this friday, Janis is having a party.. So, that IS something to look forward to..   I'm sad. All my life, I've never seen guys as.. 'boyfriend' material. It was always.. Oh! He'd make a great older brother! Or.. Oh! He'd make a GREAT friend.. It was never.. OH MY GOD! I wanna go out with him! Then.. well, I found someone. I like him.. I've never felt this way before about anyone, so i'm not sure if it's an 'infatuation', 'love' or just.. 'puppy love'. I won't bother thinking on it, I just know that I want to get to know this guy better. He was in both my classes this year, and I'm angry at myself for not talking to him like I should have.. He's talented (Plays the guitar, sings, performs at the coffee house), he's smart.. he's funny.. he's cute.. he knows WHEN to be sarcastic.. he's respectable.. AND he plays cards, and knows every trick in the book! Yes, I know all this and I've hardly talked to the guy.. (In the last few days, however, I started to talk to him a lot..) The thing that has me down, however, is that he's really popular.. I'm not unpopular, but i'm just.. not there yet. I'm sad because I don't know him enough to just.. ask for his phone number, or ask him for his MSN. I won't see him for two months, unless I bump into him on the street.. and i'm scared to death that I won't have a class with him next year, destroying all my chances anything ever happening.. You're probably thinking.. Alison, you're SUCH a loser.. it's true, but hey.. I'm finally maturing.. It's a sign.  All I can do is hope for the best.. and re-read his little message he wrote in my yearbook! RAWR!  Everyday, I wake up. I think.. where is this life going? I mean, really.. At the moment, everything sucks.. My stepdad has been in the hospital since march 16th, my mom isn't here every wednesday or saturday.. I sit on this damn computer all day, literally.. I'm lazy.. and yet, I CLEAN.. I do everything around here it seems.. my brothers are lazy arse pigs, who leave messes everywhere they step. I still don't know what I want to do for a living, and I REALLY need to start going to the gym again..   I think once I get a job, get my G1, lose atleast 20 pounds and keep it off and get back to school.. i'll be happier. At the moment, however, I'm miserable.. My guitar skills have even suffered! I forget EVERYTHING..    Ugg.. I just want my life to be perfect, and i'm not allowed! It's like.. i'm being controlled.. I don't understand.. I'm not a robot! I don't need anyone to control my life.. just, leave me the nuck alone.. Anyway, yeh, wasn't as long as I thought it'd be.. but my hand is hurting, as someone kicked my locker door SHUT ON MY KNUCKLES, the JACKASS.. ok, i'm out..   Toodles..      -Allie

       Ok, so everyone has a 'taste' - since I had absolutely nothing better to do, I decided to explore my own 'taste'  As a result, I found myself in Adobe Photoshop, playing around for over an hour, shrinking down and softening pictures of my 'taste' and uploading them on the internet for you all to view.. Instead of writing how much I love each one (Pretty self-explanitory..) I wrote which movies/shows they've stared in.  So, without further adue, scroll down and check out my ultimate entertainers!         Johnny Depp  (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sleepy Hollow, From Hell, Ed Wood)       Brad Pitt  (Troy, Ocean's Eleven, Fight Club, The Mexican)       Orlando Bloom  (Lord of the Rings, Troy, Pirates of the Caribbean)       Jake Gyllenhal  (Bubble Boy, The Day After Tomorrow, October Sky)       Dominic Monaghan  (Lord of the Rings, Spivs, The Purifiers)       Joaquin Phoenix  (Gladiator, Signs, The Village, Quills)       Jude Law  (Enemy at the Gates, A.I, Cold Moutain, Road to Perdition)       Chris Kattan  (Night of the Roxburry, SNL, Corky Romano, Undercover Brother)       Heath Ledger  (A Knights Tale, The Four Feathers, The Patriot, The Order)       Evan Farmer  (Austion Powers: Goldmember, While you were out, 2ge+her)       Colin Farrell  (American Outlaws, The Recruit, Daredevil, S.W.A.T, Hart's War)       Andrew Dan-Jumbo  (Carpenter on 'While you were out')       Viggo Mortensen  (Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo, Perfect Murder, G.I Jane)       David Spade  (Dickie Roberts, Just Shoot Me, Joe Dirt)       Ellen Degeneres  (The Ellen Degeneres Show, Finding Nemo, The Ellen Show)       We can't forget Jack Black, Jimmy Fallon, Josh Hartnett, Ben Afflec, Tom Hanks, Billy Boyd, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Noah Wylie.. etc.. etc..  There ya go.. those are just some of my favourite entertainers.. (Meaning they aren't the only ones.. just the only ones I could think of off the spot..) I respect them, love them, adore them, support them, and basically.. live off them.. Stay tuned for my music tastes, my artist tastes, cartoon tastes, movie tastes.. hey, i'm hooked now!

      So, I went to the Midway Fair. Again. That's three days in a row I've hung with all my friends.. It was kind of nice, actually. Thursday, we went to the midway for cheap day. It was a dollar a ticket. We went on the Tilt-A-Whirl, Bumper Cars, Ferris Wheel and The Zipper. Well, it was fun! And, of course, I fell inlove with a carnie. Stupid me, STUPID STUPID me.. Surprisingly, it wasn't the Stephen Dorff look-a-like.. It was a native guy, with a ponytail.. I don't know what it was, but he was just such a sweet, cute guy.. He even went on the ride WITH us.. But yeh, he was the reason I rode the Tilt-A-Whirl so much. So, then friday, I wrote my Law Exam. I went into it with an 81%, so I should do pretty good! Then, that night, we had a big sleepover at Janis's house. It was a blast, and we ate lots of junk and watched all these movies.. Like, Dickie Roberts, Corky Ramano and Pitch Black. Good stuff. Then, Saturday, I was at her house till lunchtime, and I came home and was very bored, and realized I had caught a cold.. Grr.. so, i spent the night being sick.. Then, today, was the smash up derby! We painted a car for art class, and it was in there.. so, we had to go cheer it on! unfortunately, it got so hot out that we just dumped the smash up and went back to the midway, rode rides.. and my carnie was there again! I went on that ride 10 times.. ;/ and the zipper twice..   Yeh, then.. well, heres my story.. my friends all left, and i decided I'd go to cuz i had no money, i was tired and hot and just.. unhappy. BUT - I wanted to ride the Tilt-A-Whirl one last time.. so, i went on by myself. STUPID idea.. the carnie came over and asked if I could sit with a 6 year old kid.. Ok, fine.. not a big deal, so he sat down.. then, this really HUGE lady with horribly ugly curly orange hair, no teeth except for two rotten brown ones that bucked from her lower lip, huge sweat stains along her skin-tight pink shirt, and a horrible glint in her buldging eyes comes around and goes.. CAN I SHARE WITH YOU.. I said Yes, because i'm a nice person.. so she sits down, smelling like tabacco and B.O and shifts up against this poor kid beside me, who sat as still as a stick the entire ride.. So, it starts up and she's just chatting about something and suddenly it spins and she goes.. OH MY GOD! THIS IS BETTER THEN SEX!!! and everytime that thing spun around, she'd scream that out.. Then she laughed so stupidly and goes.. I CANT STOP LAUGHING! BETTER THEN SEX! BETTER THEN SEX!   I wanted to shove this woman from the seat.. this poor kid beside me looked like he wanted to cry, and I looked very unhappy.. the carnie was looking at me from the control seat with such obvious sympathy, like he wanted to give me a hug.. lol When it was finally over, I helped the kid out and the lady stumbled around. The carnie came over, gave me that 'Oooookkaayyy..' kinda look, and we snickered secretly. Then, that lady turns around and goes..  'YOU GOING ON AGAIN, BUDDY?!?!' Im like.. uhhh.. no and the carnie went.. 'No, she isn't ma'am, now get off the platform..'  HA.. stupid lady.. yummy carnie.. cute little kid..   God, it was scary.. and now I miss the carnie.. IT's sad, knowing i'll never see him again.. :( But anyway, yeh.. that's my story.. i'm off to bed now, though, cuz it's 3:00am, and i'm sick..  Toods.       -Allie

      Howdy! Well, this is different.. so many new properties in the 'post' box.. Look, my text is maroon! Spiff.&nbsp;Shows you how often I update.. lol&nbsp;Anyhoo.. so, not a lot has happened. Well, ok a few things have happened.. &nbsp;1. On July 22nd, I turned 17! It doesn't feel any different.. Infact, it's rather depressing. I'll be an adult next year, by legal terms.. but in my head, i'll always be 17. I'm really enjoying it so far! Didn't do anything exciting on my birthdate. Had KFC and cake.. got a bunch of cards, with money and scratch tickets.. got some claigon body spray.. yeh..&nbsp;2. Went to Kris's house for a sleepover.. it was fun, because we went driving around with this dude named Josh. Me, Jan and Kris sat in the back, while britt sat in the front.. It was fun! Lots of music, and speeding.. and swirving.. and driving over bumps.. and yeh.. then we watched some Foamy.. starsky and hutch.. and stayed up all night. &nbsp;3. Harry back in hospital. He had surgery to clean up his pancreas, take out his galbladder and whatever else they did..&nbsp; I didn't ask.&nbsp;4. Probably not going to Newbrunswick, very pissed.&nbsp;5. Ate some cheese&nbsp;6. Updated my entire webpage! Layout and all.. Go check!  urlLink www.geocities.com/ShadedGuitarGeek/Main.html   So yeh.. not much else to type.. except if anyone reads this;&nbsp;PLEASE, I repeat.. PLEEASSEEEE, sign this petition! (It's for Same Sex Marriages in Canada  urlLink www.petitiononline.com/lbgtmun/petition.html   So, here's a picture..  AHhHhhHh!  eh, er.. Oh! I've been really busy in adobe photoshop 7 lately.. and here are a few pictures i've done for different projects.. mostly character sketches for stories me and my buds are writing.. :)     (This is Anna Paquin in&nbsp;The Piano (1993), but I used various pictures and re-named her Evelyn for my friends story..)&nbsp;   (A gothic, grunged up Brad Pitt picture.. WOO! Yeh, he's for a story aswell..)&nbsp;   (Another character sketch.. this is Lindsay Lohan, manipulated and gradiated..)&nbsp;     (This is some dude, some wolf, and a really creepy drawing all put together.. took off the dude's necklace, made everything blue, added the backgroud, changed the eye colours to yellow.. Yeh.. spiff!)  &nbsp;There are more.. but that's good for now.. :DI'm getting better at Adobe if I do say so myself..Yeh.. i'm off.. watched GREASE today! GO GREASE!   -Allie  &nbsp;  -Allie  -Allie
