      hey guys! well we just got home from the hospital, Nick is doin a little better! He made it out of surgery fine, they ended up having to remove 3/4 of his small intestine, he will never be able to play football again, he is going to have a very long recovery, but he has made progress!! his brain activity was only at 30 and now it is up to 66, so he is a little more aware of what is goin on! but He is an extremely strong guy, so we know he will pull through! We'll be up there again real soon to check on him again, and i'll keep ya updated!! Keep him in your prayers!! love you all!- bRiTtAnY-

      hey, its me again!, ok, well it turns out Nick is a lot worse off than we all thought!! It is sooo sadd!! =( I just got home from the hospital, and the latest news is ... he has 3 cracked vertebrae, broke ribs, hole in his colon, partially collasped lung (but they put a tube in there to drain the blood). When he got to the hospital, his temperature was 90 degrees, cause he lost soo much blood, but they have gotten it up to about 94-95 degrees now,which is good!, He is on a ventalator to help him breathe so his body won't have to use any energey, except to begin healing!.. He is in Stable, but critial condition. He is having another surgery tomorrow at 12:30! We are all gonna go up there again tomorrow! Keep him and his family in your thoughts and prayers! *^*We Love You So Much Nick!*^* Hang in there!!

      *!*ok I have been thinking wayy to much!!*!* Its crazyy how people change!!... I have no idea why I started thinking about him, but I've had Justin on my mind alll day!! weird huh?, I guess it is because it is his B-Day!! * HaPpY BiRtHdAy JuStIn!* but anyway... There is totally NOTHING there AT ALL!!.. I'm happy with everything goin on right now with a certain someone!!! hehe.. but I just thought about all the memories we had together, all the stuff we went through, him being there for me through anything and everything! I will always *MISS*: the ^MANYYY^ hours we spent on the phone, always watching football together, all the Jokes we had, I will miss him callin me *SuNsHiNe*, I will miss him.. calling me ENTIRELY TOOOO early in the morning just to tell me he was thinking about me and loved me!, I will miss his truck(hehe), I will miss watchin 'Trading Spaces' and 'While you were Out' EvErY Saturday together!, I will miss him calling me to tell me our song was on!, I will miss him always askin me 'how the "dog" is doing?', I will miss his hugs and kisses, and sooo many more thing about him! But, even though we have gone our separate ways, which I know is for the best, He will always mean a lot to me, and he knows that! I honestly wish the best for him!, I'll always remember him and all the times we had together, they are just things I could never forget!! ... Although I wish in a way I had never dated him because of our *aWeSoMe* friendship that we no longer have, I wouldn't have changed a thing!, I learned sOoOoO much from dating him so long!, but its all good!! I just felt like gettin all that out!! hehe!! well David is calling!! so I'm gone!! byeee!

Love isn’t love ‘til you give it away.”   “Follow your heart and you’ll never get lost.”  'Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without, someone you you fall head over heels for, love is everything everyone lives for, Love is Life!'  *If you look down on others, you turn your head down from god, but by considering yourself lower than others and serving, you always have to look up to people, which guides your eyes towards the heavens.*  *^*It takes 3 seconds to say *i love you*, 3 hours to explain it, and a Lifetime to prove it!*^*  ^Meeting you was fate,  being friends with you was a choice, but fallin in love with you was beyond my control.^  #You don't loose by loving, you loose by holding back.#  One day I asked you whose life was more important, yours or mine?, You said mine, and I walked away not knowing that you are my life!

I was on the phone so Julie went and asked some nigger if they had it and he was like 'nahh we done sold out of it' and so she was like 'ohh, ok' and I was like yea right! they have to have it! so we went and asked a different nigger and she was like 'yes its right over here' and she went and got it!, we were like wtf?... so we went and checked out in that line with the guy that told us it was sold out! and he was like 'did yall find everything ok?' and I was like 'yep, we found the "sold out" movie we were looking for', and he was like 'ohhh yall found one?' and we were like 'yea, sitting with the other 30', haha but anyways!

No! I didn't have any guy!' and so we argued about that for a lil bit! then I had to go so he said he would call me tomorrow and we would talk about everything, and he said he didn't hate me!.. so I guess things are a little better, at least we are going to try to fix things!~*...  but anyways.. so after Wal-Mart we went up to the bowling alley, LOL!!, we went up there to see Brenton and Jarrod(FaTtY)! it was actually pretty funN!, I love those guys!!, we met Jarrod's brother, Jeremy, he was cool too!.. oh today is amanda's birthday!!

      hey guys!.. I haven't felt like bloggin! sorry about that, but anyways!... Friday night, me and elizabeth went to the rodeo, we were on the ground RIGHT in front of Trace Adkins when he performed!, its was funn!!, then I saw Josh, and he wanted us to go to the dance after it, but we decided that we would wait until sat. night! so me and Eliz and Jessica, went back to elizabeth's house and spent the night, and David B. got Elizabeth's number from jessica, so we got her a man! hehe!! he's a sweetheart!!.. so Saturday (..Valentine's day... mine and Justin's anniversary...) anyways... well it was already not such a great day to start with, but then it got better... but it was back down hill at the end of that night!... We get to the rodeo... and I haven't heard from Josh, well i saw him but it was from a distance so I couldn't like go talk to him or anything... but a lil while later he found where we were sitting and came and sat with me!, then we went down to the floor when Jeff Bates performed! (that poor guy, he was TeRrIbLe, like hardly anyone cheered for him, it was sooo sad, but me and elizbaeth were like jumping up and down and screamin to make him feel loved).. so Josh's phone rings in the middle of that and it was come girl and he said it was just one of his friends... blah blah blah, so i was all in a pissy mood! and I was real short with him and everything! so after the rodeo he was like well 'I'm about to go ahead and go over to the dance, are you coming?' and I was like 'yea i guess in a lil bit' and he was like 'ok, i'll see you in a minute'.. so like 30 min. later we go over there and there were soooooo many people there!!, it was unreal! but anyways, so me and elizabeth and david b. run into Orin and are talkin or whatever! and then we see Josh, and he's like giving me all these ugly looks, like I was there WiTh orin or something (not that i would have minded, lol, he's fineee!, haha j/k), but anyways, so I was already mad at him, so i wasn't about to go up and try and make things better, so I didn't and he was mad, cause I was talkin to a friend (i mean since that is soooo wrong and everything)... but anyways so me and him and that whole situation went a Big.. NO WHERE!!, but it was pretty much pointless to begin with cause he lives in lucedale!!, but anyways, he is sweet and VERYYYYY HOTT!! but its all good, there are plenty more out there!, I didn't really see that so-called relationship going anywhere!, well I didn't think about Justin much on Valentine's!, which is kinda surprising!, I figured I would have!, I dreaded Valentines' soo bad, but I mean it really wasn't that badd, i know the whole Josh thing didn't turn out very well in the end, but we still had funn the time we did spend together!, he's a nice guy, but it just wouldn't have worked out!! but anyways... moving on... Sunday night me and Elizabeth and Dana went to Margarita's! it was soo good!.. then we went to Brenton's house and saw him and Jarrod!, then Eliz stayed at my house!, and Monday we didn't have school!, so I went to Clinton and met up with Julie and we went to Wal-mart, then we went to Matt's and saw him, Jarrod, and Brenton! I felt like crap all day!! well, i wake up today and I thought I was dying!, my wisdom teeth are coming in and they hurt EXTREMELY bad!, but thats the least of my problems!, mom insists on taking me to the doctor!, and I have Strep! is that great or what?.. well I'm all for gettin some medicine and going home, but nooo, I'm just 'sooo sick' I MUST have a freakin shot!!.... ugh!!!!!!!!.. i mean you might as well shoot me, before you give me a shot! I'm the BIGGEST chicken when it comes to that stuff!!! i just can't handle it, well anyways... it gets worse!!... so after the shot!, they decide that I probably have Mono too, so after they stab me once, the lil nurse comes back in there ready to draw blood to test it to see if I have Mono too!... so yea my day SUCKKED!!!... but anyways, i feel a little better! my teeth hurt worse than anything!, I can't eat anything! I've lost 4 pounds!! I weigh 106 now! .. but anyways, I think I've talked long enough about absolutly nothing important or anything that you wanted to know about!! so I'm gone! we'll holla!~*

      hey guys!... gahh... I'm slackin, I  haven't blogged in a while!! I'm a failure right Julie??!..ah well I try!.. lets see what I did this weekend... well Friday I skipped school, and went with Elizabeth to the Fairgrounds for her Show! we were there at like 9 in the morning and left at like 7 or 8 that night! it was a very long day but it was funn!!... we met A TON of HOTTTT guys, haha! then I started feeling like total crap! and we got to her house and I thought I was gonna die! I got NO sleep!, Then Saturday... yea ..it sucked too! i slept and layed around all day. and Elizabeth came by that night and I was asleep, but she basically lives at my house anyways, so when I woke up we watched a movie!, then.. we went to sleep! and Sunday I felt a lotttt better!! I don't know what was wrong with me in the first place, but anyways... so me and Eliz went back up to the shows Sunday and saw everyone from Friday, and ohh how could I forget...... I meT JOSH!!!... oh what a sweetheart!! i barely know him and love the kid already!... I get to see him this weekend!! *YaY!!* ... but anyways... yesterday was interesting.. I had this history report to print, but I guess it was just the day for EVERYONE's printer to be messed up!... but finally me and Julie talked to Baker, who has a working printer and said we could come over and use it! so we get over there and what do ya know... the floppy disc is screwed up!!! so it doesn't work!, and i spent 10 valuable minutes plagerizing that thing the night before (haha Michael and Julie) .. so later we go to nick's and re-plagerize a whole new report and save it to a different disc (couldn't print it..cause his printer is screwed up too) and finally get done with that damn report!. I ended up printing it at school today... haha but anyways... I don't know what else to write about, but Julie said this blog had to be long, since I haven't written one in forever!...so let me think... ok... I thought of something.... Me and Stephen are.. I guess you would say fighting *AgAiN*. whats new though?.. I swear me and him fight more than any two people i know!.. It started because He called me Friday night at about 5 and I was with Elizabeth in Jackson, and he was like 'I was just calling to tell you that I'm about to go to the mall with my brothers!' and I was like 'aight!'.. no big ya know.. so he calls Saturday while I was asleep, and I told him i had to go and to call me later!, well he didn't call until Sunday and I was with eLizabeth at her show thing.. and he was like 'well I guess your feeling better?' and I was like 'yes, actually I am', and then Brian(a guy we were playing pool with at the time) takes the phone from me and starts talkin to him, and I finally get back on the phone and Stephen is all in a pissy mood.. but I talked to him for a few more minutes.. and I asked him what he did this weekend and he said 'oh some 'people' spent the night' and I was like 'oh, ok, who?' and he started naming people (girls and boys) and it was all good until he said a certain someone's name! and I was like oh really????, well uh... I'll let you go! and he HUNG UP!!!! yea... He had the nerve to hang up on me!!, so I called him back up and I was like what are you thinking?, and he was like 'you didn't even ask if anything happened between me and 'that certain person'.. and i was like 'yea i know I don't even want to know!', and he was like 'brittany, don't start with me, this is not a good day'...blah, blah, blah... and I haven't spoken to him since then! so thats that!... oh well!.. i dunno... it'll be aight!... well I hope this is long enough for you Julie, cause I have absolutly nothing else to say! I'm gone to watch the rest of Dr. Phil! haha Michael!~:.:.:-holla-!:.:.:

      Watching every motion In my fooish lover's game On this endless ocean Finally lovers know no shame Turning and returning To some secret place inside Watching in slow motion As you turn around and say My love  Take my breath away Take my breath away  Watching I keep waiting Still anticipating love Never hesitating To become the fated ones Turning and returning To some secret place inside Watching in slow motion As you turn to me and say  Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Through the hourglass I saw you In time you slipped away When the mirror crashed I called you And turned to hear you say If only for today I am unafraid  Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Watching everything motion In this foolish lovers game  Haunted my the notion Somewhere there's a love in flames Turning and returning  To some secret place inside Watching in slow motion As you turn my way and say  Take my breath away Take my breath away -Jessica Simpson-

Cause with you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you With you  Come and take me Love you save me Like nobody else Now I can be myself With you  With you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now) Now that I'm with you     Artist : J-Kwon Title : Tipsy    	Intro: Teen drinking is very bad. Yo I got a fake ID though. Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, 2 step with me, 2 step with me.  Verse 1: 1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4, Everybody drunk out on the dance floor, Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more, Like she a groupie and I aint even on tour, Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore, Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores, Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score, If not i gotta move on to the next floor, Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1, Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun, When it come to pop man we do shit for fun, You aint got one nigga you betta run, Now i'm in the back gettin head from my hunz, While she goin down i'm breakin down what i done, She smokin my stuff sayin she aint havin fun, Bitch give it back now you don't get none.  Chorus: Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Everybody in the club gettin tipsy.  Verse 2: 2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5, Now i'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes, Couple seconds passed now i'm lookin at her thighs, While she tellin me how much she hate her guy, Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied, If you 21 girl that's alright, I wonder if a shake comin with them fries, If so baby can i get em super sized, Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2, She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue, Girl you super thick so i'm thinkin that's kool, But instead of 1 lifefab i need 2 Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels, Expression on her face like she aint got a clue, And she told me she don't run with a crew, You know how i do but i guess one gotta do.  --Chorus--  Verse 3: 3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6, Self explanatory I ain't gotta say i'm rich, This single man aint tryna get hitched, Nigga waste it on me man son of a bitch, Brushed it all off now i'm back to gettin lit, Grisa orange juice man this some good ish, Homeboy trippin cause i'm starin at his chick, Now he on the sideline starin at my clique, Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3, Hands in the air if you thugs drunk as me, Club on the set kwon cut out them ......., Dude i don't care i'm a p.i.m.p.  --Chorus--

      hey guys! this is julie! and i know what you're thinking! "did i go to the wrong website?" haha well the answer to that is no! i'm bloggin for brittany today because she is a blog failure and is too lazy to type a couple paragraphs.. so for lack of better things to do.. and as vbf.. i am writing her blog. well this was her weekend.. starting with saturday! she woke up at 9:30, got dressed, and went to the mall with dana..they shopped like all day (without me) and went to lunch.. bought a lot of goodies! then she met up with me and we went to nick's... theres was like 7 people there and we played 'know it all'..this includes brad, who was trippin everyone out.. he thought kate spade was a bball coach.. and whenever he was wrong, he kinda -to himself- said "ShAT" ..lol.. okay so then me, brittany, and gracie went and met the alleged REX...... who was not exactly what we had in mind.. needless to say he scared brittany to death when he begged me to leave her alone with him... then we came up with an incredibly desperate plan. we lied. we told him a friend of ours was stranded at walmart and we had to go get her and take her to her home in utica..and would not be coming back from clinton.. reality of the situation: gracie was in my car.. stayed with us for like 2 more hours, until we took her home, to lakeridge. after all that though, we went and got Mex, JP, and Boo (brenton didnt go because he was sick). we went riding around and then to brett's (boo's) parents' house to play pool and watch madd tv and pretty woman..we had fun! it was great! okay well then we went on home! sunday, since i hadn't gone to the mall this weekend, i made brit go with me to northpark, where we saw Cary, Josh, and Matt. Josh and Matt left and we made Cary walk around with us for a couple hours.. we shopped till i was sick of spending my own money.. so we went to old navy and then took cary home just down the road... alright, so we went to krystals to buy some food haha.. and josh called brit.. josh as in josh wilkinson.. they talked a while.. i chatted with him too.. well then brit went home.. that brings us to monday!.. boring school.. gay homework.. i came over.. we played out of order for countless hours.. and then i left.. brittany talked on the phone and online for some more countless hours and then that brings us to tuesday! which is today! which means........ a long hard day at school (and a lovely algebra 2 test).., chosing class rings, and a crappy lunch. well that brings us to now. we're sittin at brit's.... eating animal crackers! hahah!!!! anyways! i guess i'll end this blog now.. so thanks for readin!......... GeT'eR DoNe!!!

      hey yall! this past weekend has been the BY FAR craziest weekend ever!! and I'm not sure what I can and can't say! so I'll just let yall read Julie's blog!   hey guys.. WoW.. this weekend started off aMaZiNg.. and now it suddenly BLOWS!!! we'll just start with the amazing part.. that part doesn't last long- don't worry. Thursday night me and brittany chilled for a while once she got off of work.. we met up with baker, charlie, crask, kyle, and chandler.. we went to baker's for a while.. that's all in my last blog.. we spent a lot of time with brenton and matt this weekend. we got to hang out with neil and steve.. we hung out with will a. and michael p. too.. i bumped into kelsey (cousin) - i havent seen her in a long long time- and molly.. we saw matt b., kameron b., and johnny g. too! saw chris and michael b. and charlie again.. then spent some more time with matt and brenton.. watched like 500 movies... got in a hot tub (that didn't last long, haha) .. we went and saw chad m., jessi b., and cole m. ... a very very very strange thing for me to have allowed myself to do.. some things just don't seem like they go together quite well... but its whatever.... so yeah yeah yeah~ to all yall my weekend might not sound all that *gRaNd*FrEaKiN*TaSTiC* but it really was SoO+ much fun! last night me and brittany chilled a while and i felt like complete cRaP.. like .. throwin up blood... yeah its sick but that's what happened. brit pulled over so i could like catch my breath and then we started goin again right.. okay well bLuE LiGhTs ArE a BiTcH!!! we got pulled over b/c we "looked suspicious" b/c we only paused for a min and then started goin again and he just happened to drive by in the time we parked.. he ran a check on brit's license and then let us go.. i mean what else could he do? we didn't do anything wrong so he couldn't exactly arrest us.. i mean come on?! that sucked reallly reallly reallly bad.. but that's not even the beginning of what ruined my weekend!! oohh!~ and get this. i fell down some stairs haha.. but i gotta admit it really was funny as anything.. like i didn't fall down.. i just missed one step and that made me miss about 15 more haha.. my right arm scraped the banister thing on the side and i was bleeding... it looked like i tried to slit my wrists and only did one... it still looks kinda rough but oh well.. it was my own fault... but that's still nothing compared to all the crap that went on this weekend... i'd love to share all the b/s details with yall but i am not allowed to.. and neither is the only other person who knows.. i made some sucky decisions and let's just say they caught up with me... bad. i'd take it back if i could... but i can't so there goes that idea. i am kinda grounded but kinda not.. which is a major first.. ive never gotten in trouble for like anything before.. i'm still not really in trouble.. b/c my daddy doesn't know the whole spill. my mom kinda like put me on probation i guess u could say... it's very strange.. and i could prolly get in trouble for talkin bout all this.. but its a risk i am obviously willing to take. i could go ahead and spill the beans n just spill em everywhere but i know CeRtAiN ppl still read this.. and those certain ppl couldn't keep a secret even if it was a life or death type deal... oh well.. anyway. i went to church this morning.. i couldnt go to the confirmation so i went to my church and i couldn't sit through it.. i felt so sick so my mom let me go sleep in the car.. when we got home i slept until like 5:30 and then i called brittany and woke her up too. i went with my mom to raymond and to the movie place.. got some dvds for me n britt to watch tonight.. we may have some ppl here, not really sure yet.. on the way there, me and my mom weren't feeling very chatty so i had the radio goin ya know.. yeah, well i busted out in tears b/c of the songs that came on.. first "perfect" came on... but it was like the version w/o bass or something.. i teared up b/c it reminds me of a guy i know.. he dedicated it to his real daddy... (and i used to be in LOVE with that guy so it got to me a lil quicker).. so when that song went off.. i was like 'aw sad' or whatever.. then "The Reason" came on.. i was like what's the deal!?.. for those of you who didnt know, i cry almost every time i hear that song b/c it kinda describes a relationship i used to have with someone who was and still is very important to me whether they know it or not.. and whether i like it or not.. that will probably never change. after that "Here Without You" came on and i was like DeAr GoD.. i wanted to like shoot myself.. cuz it was mine n someone else's song... i was like screw it.. screw it all!!! but i mean seriosuly screw all that.. i still love all those people to death... i really really do.. but some things never change.. and some things HAVE to.. for better or worse this is how it all worked out. but i mean.. that's life. mine especially. its full of screw ups.. oopses.. regrets.. amazing moments.. and memories that never fade. some that you'd kill to forget and some you pray to God you never ever do. i sound like one of those lil "quote for the day" books... or a fortune cookie or something. God i should be shot. i really really should. this blog has jumped from one thing to the next.. sorry about that.. but its hard to help stuff like that when you have so much to say.. and so much you just can't... me and brit were talkin the other day and we decided that we really miss jarrod. he used to be our best best best friend.. and then it just stopped. it was sooo weird especially now that we're so close to matt and brenton again.. kinda odd but that's how it all worked out.. anyway... we decided we wanted to be friends with jdawg again.. but we didn't know how to go about it.. well he IMed brittany today... its progress at the very least! who knows.. maybe we'll al be best friends again. okay it is SO past time to shut up! i love yall so0o much and here's a quick tip.. think about the consequences of your actions before you just go and think you know all the answers.. before you do what you think is best.. it may seem great at the time but i promise it will come back to you.. ...No oNe kNoWs eVeRy tHiNg... *JuLie eLiSe cArGiLe*

      what up?.. well i have officially decided that Cary is the biggest bullshitter I know!, yea I know that in my last blog I was rambling on about how awesome he is and all that!, but i was Very wrong!, now I know *for the second time* why me and him are NOT meant to date and why every time me attempt to make it work, it ends up like this!! I do NOT know what his problem is, I haven't talked to him since Saturday night and thats only because I called his sorry ass!... but me and Julie have made an agreement that I can't call or talk to him, until he calls me! and there is a consiquence If I do call him! but I do not want to have to suffer through it, so there is no chance in hell I'll be callin Cary Trammell anytime soon!, lol! (I can't say what the consequence is!)... but anyways... I understand people have crap they are going through, but that doesn't mena he has to take it out on me! and I found out some very disturbing news about him and the things he does that I really wish wasn't true, but I know they are and can't change them so, i guess this is for the best! I don't know, but its sooo weird how someone can tell you everything you wanna hear and you actually think they TRULY mean it and then turn around and all hell breaks loose!.... fuck it!... I'm not gonna even waste my time on it anymore, because I know he's not goin too!! *I'm so frusterated*-I'm out- *bRiTtAnY*

      hey! i'm haven't writtin in a while! but all I've been doin lately is working, and hangin out with Dana, Jason, Bryan, Julie, Austin, Rowdy, Kirby, Derek, Neil, Cole, Nick, Preston, Matt, Brad, Blake, Jordy, Colby, David D, Brandon, David M., Johnny Rob, Owen, Crask, Edward, Jake and everyone else!... David M. went out of town the other day with Scott M. they just got back a lil while ago, and David missed me soo much.. He called me right when he got home! =) I missed him too actually!... I didn't get woke u at 1 in the morning and talk on the phone for hours... it was kinda odd!  but anyways... Yesterday I took off work, and Julie and I went to the mall to take something back.. then we went to Clinton!... we went to Jana's house and Brad, Matt, Jordy, and Jeffrey came over!, then we all left there and went to brad's house and Colby came over there! All the Boys were working on Jordy's truck, and me and Julie were bored so we asked Brad if we could take the Tahoe to Jana's house cause 'I forgot my money there', haha!, so he said we could go!, well we went riding all around Clinton! and everybody was staring at us, cause we were in the huge truck!, it was funn!!... then we went and 'met Dana and Jana's' and then we all went back to Brad's house!.. we chilled there a while!.. and Jason had planned to take me to the movies, but by the time him and Sean got done working out and playin basketball... it was like 8:00 and so we would have had to go to a late movie, and I had to be home by 11:30 and that wouldn't have worked!... so we decided to go another night!, but he met up with me, julie, Brad, Jordy, Dana, Colby, Matt.. > by the way Dana and I took a picture with the cow! haha

      hey guys... I'm at Dana's! I spent the night with her last night becaus we both had to get up and go to work at 8:30 this morning!... yesterday when we got off work, we went to Ridgeland to David's house.. then his friend Tye came over and we all went to Wendy's cause Tye was hungry... then we left there and went to some huge party in Madison! it was crazy!.. there were more people at that one party then in the whole city of clinton!.. it was funn though!.. but guess who I bumped into there... Justin Allard... yea, he is sooo fat these days... well not like obese or anything but he is wider now than when we dated!... it was soo weird seein him though!... he like kept walkin by and finally I just busted out with hey justin!, and he was on the phone and he was like 'dude' i'll call you back' and he got off the phone and hugged me!, it was really weird, then we walked over to where Dana, Tye, and David were standing and i was like who are you here with and he names some people and then he asked me and i was like well ME & DAVID and Dana & Tye... and he was like oohhh.... and then I was like well I have to pee reallyyy bad! and I was talkin to David and justin butts in with come with me, i'll take you!... its up stairs, and I was like ummm.... ohh, ok... and so he like walked me upstairs, but thank God Dana and David came with me!... but anyways... enough about him... it was just shockin to see him, caseu he is like the last person I would have expected to see there!... but anyways... well everything was good... until someone runs up yellin 'Cops' and so everyone like started freakin out!... The Cops gave us five minutes for everyone with a car to get out, and if not then we were all gettin tickets! and that wouldn't hav ebeen a problem if it didn't take us five  minutes to walk to our car! we had to park like 1/2 a mile down the road because there were so many people there!... but it was funn!... after the party got busted we left and went to David's house and chilled there a while! and then left and came back to Clinton! We were supposed to meet up with Jason and Bryan... cause uh.. Bryan is uh.. very interested in Dana if ya know what I mean! haha!.. he is so hott! so this could definately work, haha right Dana!~... but anyways.. we are about to roll out so I'll blog about tonight tomorrow! bye bye!!*
