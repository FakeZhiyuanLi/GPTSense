						   There came a day that I was told was the day I would begin the journey to furfill my destiny. I had spent many of my hatchling years under the tutilage of the Mystics of Cabalis, they taught me all living things have a spirit, and while it was easy to convince a living being to be a tool for our regal line, the art of asking the dead spirits of animals to give to us their blessing is quite different.  I am the oldest of 4 Siblings, and I am a shaman. My brother Shasthis spent too much time playing with the Scaled Wolves, and has since become a Beastlord. Next in the Line is my Sister, who unfortunately has been pampered by the nobles of Cabalis, for she went down the respected path of Necromancer. My Brother Shaszaak has a burning in his blood to that he has forged to perfection, learning the skills of our battle hardened monks.  Since I was the eldest, I made my rite of passage first, and began my spirit walk with the first steps into the Field of Bone, a place filled with the remains of the fallen warriors of both sides of the Iksar vs Dragon battle. I spent the first few seasons of my life honing my skills against the skeletons and the Scaled Pups, and as I worked to increase my skill, I saw the powerful Deltree, an elder beastlord, hated by most Iksar for his befriending the "softskins" as we call all other races. Upon meeting him, he told me his story, and inspired me to join him in the Call of Honour, a guild of like minded warriors seeking to rid Norrath of the greater threats against us.  One I had accepted his call, I returned to my practice, and eventually getting very tired of killing the unyielding number of skeletons, I made my way to the Plane of Knowledge for the first time.  The Plane of Knowledge is hard to describe, picture a giant floating library, with stores and banks all around it, as adventurers pass through seeking to fuel their knowledge of magic, or to barter their magics with others. Many even gave young adventurer's free enhancements for battle. I was impressed by the charity of many in this place. But I also heard this place was a crossroads to connect me to any location I needed to go quicker than any boat could promise. So I touched the Kelethin Stone, it felt as if a lightning bolt hit me, and then I was standing just outside the tree city.  It was here I met a powerful barbarian named Finaid, I gave him my assistance for I felt with two strong sets of hands we could destroy the orcs, and possibly gain me enough favor to one day enter the city of Kelethin, if anything out of convienance, not out of compassion. Finaid was mighty indeed and we slayed many Orc's for countless seasons together.  Eventually I had heard that my brother had finally left the nest as well, and that Shasthis was working toward earning the respect of his warder. I found him hunting the same forest city that I had when I first got out of the nest. When I got there, I found that he had grown through many seasons without my knowing it, and so I allied with my brother as we as a duo killed many more orc than we could have alone. We entered the corrupted city of Crushbone, and we began to slay the Orcish slavers, my brother gained many more seasons under my watchful eye.   Later that evening I had heard word that my Sister had just been granter her leave from the necromancer's tower, and that she could now practice her arts on the world at large, and not just in chantries within the walls of Cabalis. We met her at the Knowledge book inside Greater Faydark, and we watched over her first few seasons. She has been tutored more in the ways of the noble iksar necromancers, and because of this has an intense hatred for living softskins than me and Shasthis.  After a few close calls, my sister decided to make camp, so we went to the Plane of knowledge, and made camp, while my brother Shasthis said he needed to finish a few things, probably testing his skills with his new warder he had earned that day. I bid him farewell, and made camp.  The next day we awoke we discovered that my other brother Shaszaak had left the nest and began to hone his fighting techniques in the ways of the monk. Shaclas our sister and Shaszaak joined forces against the vile orcs while Shasthis and I joined forces to keep watch over our brethren. I almost neglected to mention that I had met once again the mighty Kretais, a mystic elder shaman. I knelt in reverence to him, for any one strong enough to wield that much power deserved to be shown respect, even if they are a softskin. My sister and brother shaszaak didn't believe this so, and my sister told me that Shamans are soft, and challenged my life. I told her that she should not challenge the power of a shaman at her age, but her naivity won out over my wisdom.   I accepted her challenge, and promptly slowed her and blinded her, she managed to hit me with her diseases, but they had no effect on my health. I kept her blinded and repeatedly struck her in the back of the head, as I saw her swaying about to topple over, I held fast, and informed her that if she wished to stay conscious, she would yield and call off her annoying skeleton ally, I also wanted to make sure she was still strong with the enhancements the mighty kretais had laid upon us. She did yield, and we all received the blessing of temperence from Halzor, a dwarven ally from the Call of Honour. I exchanged his gift for my control over the spirit of wolf. and he left us there.   We went back into battle against the orcs, and my lesser brethren gained a few seasons, despite the best efforts of the softskins in Crushbone to antagonize the orcs and deliver them to us. We proved those softskins that we iksar are far stronger than they are, and we slaughtered all that they brought. Only one of us fell in battle, my brother Shazaak, I mourned his loss, and felt the deep rooted iksar anger against the Softskins, but I learned in my shaman training that Anger is much like any spirit, and can be controlled with enough effort, and I held my tongue.  Eventually the greedy softskins left no quarry for us, and there was nothing left to hunt in Crushbone. We made camp that night, determined to make a better day of it tomorrow.   We have ruled Norrath before, know your place softskinsss, Shactolas

						   I started this day in Cabilis after being recently liberated from the dungeons of Gloomingdeep. Being only my 3rd season I began to wander and eventually found myself once again outside the city walls. Having recently been captured I made my way cautiously into the land of Kunark. As I wandered I came upon a stone book mounted upon a pedastal and as I touched I was whisked way to an unknown land.  Fear is the strength of the Iksar thus I did not fear but I was still startled by all the noise and ... the Softskins! They were everywhere! Having the memory of the teachery of those first softskins to land on Kunark I was terrified but then I saw a familiar face. Deltree, The Great Feral Lord, basking in the sun in his alabaster robe.  As I approached the great lord he turned to address me, me a young broodling without anything but a dagger, and invited me to join the estemed guild Call of Honour. I immediately accepted having heard many of the exploits of this great guild and being aware of how selective they were of their members. Deltree then blessed me with the best spells my young form could take and I commenced my hunt.  During my time in this land, which I learned was called the Plane of Knowledge, I heard of a place called Crushbone on the continent Faydwer and of the vile orcs that live there. Appearently they were mounting an attack on the elves in the woods of Faydark. Now not that I care anything of the elves the thought of battle excited me and I traveled to the woods of Greater Faydark. It was here the next six seasons passed slaughtering endless patrols and camps of orcs. As my ninth season drew to a close I learned that another of my siblings had hatched so I raced back to Cabilis to greet my new sister and to show my guildmasters I was ready to receive training in the arts of healing and enhancment and receive my first Scaled Wolf.   Shasthis Ironscale Norrath is mine for the taking stay out of my way and you shall live ... for a time

						   Within these pages are inscribed the tales of the House of Ironscale. Noble and powerful Iksars of the 6th age of Norrath.  The eldest of the Ironscales is Shactolas. A shaman of Cazic-Thule and pupil of the Mystic Kretais. Inducted into the guild Call of Honour by the noble Feral Lord Deltree, who has always been a great ally of the House of Ironscale.  Second hatched is the ferocious Shasthis. Never one to be content with one path he has studied the ways of shaman and of monks. Finally with the guidance of Deltree and his brother Shactolas he decided to follow the path of the Beastlords and raise is very own Scaled Wolf named Scooter.  The youngest of the line hatched late and greatly consern to Shactolas, Shasthis and their mother for they feared these two broodlings would not make it. But Cazic-Thule inspired fear in these young ones that drove them from there shells and so were hatched Shaclas and Shaszaak.  Shaclas, third hatched and only female in the brood, never acquired and interest in the physical combet her brothers enjoyed and thus began to study the art of necromancy under the supervision of a 47th season Iksar named Rmdir.  The youngest Ironscale, Shaszaak, always had a nack for getting in to trouble. So he was sent to train with the Iksar monks in order to hone his energy and recklessness.

						   It has been very trying without my companions, yet I trudge on. I have a mission and a quest from Brell. I have taken many adventures from the Wayfarers Brotherhood and in all of them I am overcome with a sense of loss for my companions. It simply seems that no one else of Norrath wishes to help me in my quest. They are all greedy for fame, riches or magical jewels. I am now at a loss.   Though there is one Shadow Knight, a dark elf that beings my hope and joy. His teasing taunting have showed me that even outside of my former companions the people of Norrath can stand up to the evil and wish to overcome it. His name is Sivius. We have done many adventures together in the dungeons under Norrath and we plan to do many more.   There have been groups with us that seem to want to perish us all. Yet with Sivius I have not perished yet and neither has he. There are some arrogant fighters and spell casters in Norrath that seem to believe that they can accomplish everything themselves without the help of others. There was a barbarian warrior who would pull massive mobs when all were low on energy. He did meet his doom a few too many times; however Brell told me that he chooses his own destiny and that I should heal the others before him. I felt bad however I did as Brell told me. There was also a wizard who told us repeatedly that she can take on a dungeon by herself alone. A few hours later I saw many of her bodies that Brell did not see fit to bring back to life lying outside a cave. I believe Brell has taught her humility.  I will rest now and rejoin with Sivius tomorrow for more adventures, he is very persistent and willing to join me on my quest. It is a very nice change from the eager for fame population that lives on Norrath.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

						   I have made an entire circle and have my new spells while awaiting the return of my group. I did not know that so many of the people that live on Norrath or not inclined to help me in my noble quest. Perhaps I am still a little young with the high hopes and ambitions of the young, yet it was a shock to meet those that did not wish to smite the evil to protect the young, helpless and innocent.   I met an Iksar the first night without Ziggur and my companions, we were going to go to Dulak harbor to clear the beach. I know that Iksars are supposed to be mean and ferocious beasts however I have met many, such as Delltree, that I trusted him with my life. I was wrong. As we were swimming to the beach I yelled out to him not to swim to fast because I can not swim too well. Yet he trudged on with out me. I yelled that I am frail and have met my demise many a time on this beach, yet he still left me. There were many undead there and they all did not like intruders. I did the best that I could yet I still met a valiant doom. When Brell kindly brought me back to the Plane of Knowledge I contacted the Iksar, he had fallen fast asleep under the waters of the beach. I was not impressed. I contacted my ally’s and they retrieved my belongings for me. They were slightly concerned that I would not make it on my own however I told them that with Brells wisdom and faith I can accomplish anything.   And so I picked myself up and carried on.  -- Akcron --- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

						   This day has gone well. The evils at the castle have been eliminated. The spiders have been squished and the orcs that were present have been dealt with accordingly. It did not take too long to accomplish this with my trusty group of Ziggur, Kretais and Ellektra. They have done their jobs to the best that anyone could imagine and we had a wonderful time knowing that our deeds were the most noble of all on Norrath.  At the end of the day however I received some terrible news. Ziggur, Kretais and Ellektra will be leaving me for a short time. They must attain a brilliant sword called the SoulFire to enable Ziggur to be the best Paladin ever known. This saddened me and for a second I feared that I will be unable to meet my goals of cleansing the evil on Norrath. However, Brell shined upon me and told me that while my companions are indeed leaving on another equally important quest that the Wayfarers Brotherhood still had a need for me and its own evil to eliminate. I was proud to know that even without my beloved group that I can still commit to my quest. At that I bid my group adue and wished them on their way.

						   This day was started again near the Dark Kastanor Castle. I shiver even at the thought of entering, remembering the pain that it brought to me and my companions. I vowed to myself right then that no one should fear such things and that when my companions and I are ready we will smite every creature that sets foot on that ground with an evil thought in his mind. But, now we must get stronger. We head past the castle to a giant fortress where large dark humanoids breed their young and teach them the ways of all the dark gods and goddesses. I feel sorry for the young ones that my compainions slaughter yet I know what they will grow up to be and am grateful that I am saving them the tragedy of serving one that is not Brell. This takes us a long time, yet we are successfull. Kretais, Ziggur and I agree that we should contact the Wayfarers Brotherhood to see if they have any use of our abilities. I am ashamed that it has been so long since we have asked them, yet there are many evils in the world and we have been busy.  Kretais then called upon his powers and made us all as light as a feather. Before I knew it I was levitating. I had no idea it was so much fun to fly in the sky. I could see the world and the mountains, the slight sunset on the eastern horizon. I felt that with one long hard bellow I could cure the world simply by shouting my prayers. All the evil creatures would turn thier heads and listen immediatly putting down thier swords and maces and taking up a book of Brell. I was ashamed at my naivite yet it was a wonderous and emignatic feeling of power. Though I must admit that I like being little and so close to the ground. Ziggur and Kretais miss out on so much that I see from my small stature. Such as did you know ants and other small bugs have the cutest little faces? Everyone should bend down and take a look, it might bother you to step on such small creatures.  Brell has blessed me yet again with new spells and abilities that I will put to good use. I picked these up on my way to the Wayfarers Camp where they told me of a great evil in one of the many dungeons on Norrath. It seems that the evil is starting to creep slowly into Lesser Faydark and they thought that these creatures are just right for me, Ziggur and a few other companions to smite. I agreed and contacted Ziggur, his beastlord friend, another paladin and a ranger to help. We went through the dungeon smoothly and with ease. These creatures were of no match for Brell's powers in our group. We take care of this in less than an hour and are on our way again to the Kastanor Castle eager to beat this evil once and for all.

						   Our journeys have been successful, perhaps too successful. The evil creatures that we have been fighting have found a particular hatred for me. I have been smited down time and time again. My companions are bewildered they have all tried to protect me to the best of their abilities however the evil in this Castle is just too strong.   We have camped here for more than a week, every day that I rise I pray to Brell for safety however I don’t believe he hears my pleas. The guards of the castle are just too strong for any of our endeavors and we have yet to triumph. I fear that perhaps my companions and I are too weak to clear the evil of this place. We have succeeded in a number of these dark creatures yet there are more to dispel.   Kretais the sage of our group has decided that we must first level and gain more power by smiting lower evils first then return to this Dark Castle to clear this castle. Ziggur, my dear friend, has also ran to the Bazaar to buy me better armor. He fears that the evil ones everywhere might wish me harm.   Pray for us all,   Ackron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

						   I was a cleric. Clothed in nothing but a flimsy robe and Brell, yet I was still young and with the ideals of one so young and naive. I will cure the world of all the pain and suffering it could have. I didnt think there would be so much. I traveled with a few friends of mine in the begining, ranging from an Froglok wizard, Ribbikolos, to one of my close friends an Iksar shaman named Shaktolas, both have since moved on.   I met my closest friend a paladin named Ziggur in about my 10th rotation. He also feels the innermost need to cure the world of pain and suffering. He introduced me to all of my current companions in the guild of Call of Honour. There are two Vah Shirs, a shaman named Kretais and Konath a warrior. However, I find that Ziggur needs the most of my attention. He is a wonderful companion and bodyguard, yet I find that, like myself, he puts his own life as forfeit for others to live. We ran along Norrath for many years together clearing the world of all that is evil, however as I roamed I found that evil is everywhere that I go. No matter how big the Call of Honour becomes the evil will always be bigger. Yet, we can try and what we dispell will never come back again. Their cousins and sons might, but they certainly will not.   Along the way we also picked up a few more for our journey, another paladin name Katheena and a Dark Elf named Ellektra. Both are essential for our plans. Ellektra, though her race is not one known for good has been convinced of our mission. Brell has even blessed her with the ability to mezmerize the fierce creatures that we fight so that I can heal our companions. Katheena is also essential, though not yet as strong as our Ziggur and Konath, she will soon be able to kill the monstors as swiftly as they.  For now, I must go. Tommorrow we are going to Lower Gukta to kill the Arch Magi. Ellektra needs a robe that a certain Magi drops so that she may be a more effective enchanter. I also hear that it is a prime place to clear out the undead of the area.  Akcron --- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

						   Gnomes believe that they are the best thing since Brell. However I slightly disagree. My father, mother and all of my 6 siblings are tinkerers. They make the tinkering merchants, suppliers and other handy tinks for my city. I personally hate them. They are loud and they break. Yes, they are a good idea and all but what if you just want an ale and some company! I hate drinking ale alone, its depressing. Yet when the families away or busy and I want an ale just try to find a live human being. I told this to my father once and he made me a talking tinker toy. He doesnt have much of a brain and only say 5 things. 'Hi', 'Bye', 'Come back soon','How are you today?' and 'Missed you while you were gone.' Hard to have a conversation of deep thought within those capasities. I tried to program it to be smarter, know a little about nature, gnomes and philosophy. Totally broke but I'm not so sad about it. One time when I was young I told my mother I wanted a pet. Something to love, hold and take care of. I personally wanted a young dire wolf puppy. I thought that if I took care of him just right then he would love me and never grow up to eat me or any other gnome. I thought that after that he could go out into Rivervale and tell all the other dire wolves that gnomes are nice and wonderful and not eat them. My parents didn't agree with this and so my father, mother and siblings all made me a tinker puppy. Who wants a clanky metal puppy when nice warm fluffy ones are right outside thier city?  My mother sat me down one day. I was slightly lit and bashed so gnomes, my city, those blasted toy and the world at large. She was repulsed, she thought that something might be wrong with my head. My father came in on half the bout as well, he thought that I was accursed and perhaps not a gnome at all. They didnt know what to do with me. If I was of an uncivilized race then I probably would have died, however gnomes really are not that violent. My bags were packed the next day and I was off to the nearest School of Brell. I wasnt too pleased as I too was set in my ways of long nights with an ale bottle and mornings that dont exist, yet at least here I could talk to living beings.   There I learned to be cleric of Brell. Fantsy that. Me, Ackron, the gnome voted "One With the Least Potential" was a cleric. I studied hard and found the entire dogma absolutly fasinating. I was entranced. Soon I learned how to call upon the favor of Brell for healing and power. I was also taught that some used this power for evil yet I swore to never do so. I still am young and even cry when I stub my toe. Pain is terrible and I will cure all the pain in Norrath if I must die a thousand times to do so.  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      Mood: indifferent and Tired  So goes a typical morning here at work. Only problem is that I was 30 minutes late today :( I hate alarm clocks, they need to be more precise, this is not to say that they aren't precise about the original alarm going off, but it seems once you hit that snooze button, life becomes a gamble. Will it go off, and when? I don't think it's too much to ask for a snooze button that is reliable(will always go off again) and consistent(will go off at X minutes later). Oh well, I woke up to it at 9am, could've gotten up then. But I still blame the thing for not going off early enough. I got up at 10:57am, 3 minutes before work, it takes 5 minutes to get to work, and it takes my fam about 15 minutes to prepare for work on a rush day.  Hate alarm clocks, absolutely hate them. Anyway, Played more EQ last night after eating some corn dogs. Things went well, but I about passed out while playing, and that's never fun. Was just totally drained. Had to call off our hunt on pirates, though we did get some diamonds and other high sell items, we each ended up with 75 platinum, not a bad haul. Put my character on Trader last night to try and sell some velium I had on me(very pricey ore sells really high) but apparently my internet was going wonkie, cycled the router today and resetup my trader in EQ, so hopefully he stays up tonight, and when I get home, I hope to see mountains of money :)  Anyway, typical day on the helpdesk, they've put me on the Customer Service side(I've done both and like Tech better) which is alright, except the angry customers hunting for money, but that's only a small portion of my calls. the rest are definitely getting all mixed up in our systems and I have to unravel the strands to get them back on track. There's rarely a wait on my line, so most of my time I'm sitting here relaxing and writing stuff like this :)   More to come as it happens.  Please try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix Malakai

      Okay, new blog from a new blogger. Don't cringe yet, I'm sure you'll find something interesting here. Now I figure it's time to give you the run down on who I am to give you a frame of reference for future posts.  I'm a 21 year old ex-Air Force Computer Programmer turned Internet Helpdesk. I have a fiance SammyCaine, and a kid very close to hitting the 2yr old mark. I was a goth in my teenage years, and still have that angsty goodness in my soul, just doesn't come around as much. Been using a computer since I was 4, been playing role playing games since I was 18 in the Air Force.  hopefully that helps a little bit in understanding what makes me who I am. This was supposed to be yesterdays little opening blurb, but it didn't happen. Why? because the best of plans will certainly fail. I actually didn't give myself enough time while at work to publish this. So we're gonna do a dual day post :)   Someone might ask, why didn't I finish this post last night after work? because my computer dumped on me. OS had been about:blank hijacked, and so I did a lot of headscratching all week, tried to run a few simple commands that reset the OS back to stabilityville, and hopefully nuke that lil trojan out of my computer. But instead, it took out the whole system. Typical. so last night I spent reloading all my critical stuff(Windows, Windows Updates, Motherboard drivers and utilities, all other system drivers, Anti-Virus, and Office) then making sure I could still access Everquest.  Forgot to mention that I play everquest, I know. Some of you will probably shun me for that, I don't care, it's more complex than just picking up a box at the store and playing it. But I'll leave that to a seperate post. Wanna try to keep on track of this post, which is about what happened yesterday(since it's extremely tough to write about today today, I mean, how much is there to say about a day just started?  So last night, SammyCaine was sick, so she didn't get to partake in the action last night, she was watching TV snuggled in blankets. Very cute, while I was right behind her, playing my Dwarf Paladin trying to hit level 40. This was optimal since I could tend to her needs, and get my fix. About 3 hours of play later, I hit 40 with my paladin, I was very happy since I have a weapon that does something special at 40, it heals my character 7% whenever the effect triggers.  After that, and not realizing it was 3am, I decided to play my necromancer to get his level 8. did that as well. Logged off and went to bed around 4am. This is the life of an EQ junkie.  This morning, woke up to kicks from the fiance to get up, at 8am :( needless to say I'm not the most chipper person in morning hours, especially after doing a all night burn on EQ. So I growled and moaned about sleep, got up, changed the kid. brought him into our room while I tried to feign comatose on the bed, that didn't work either. Sick people have this kind of special pitch of whine that prohibits doing anything other than assisting them in their endeavor. So out of bed I go, grumbling all the way at 9:00am, to get myself and the kid some breakfast(Kix for him yech, and Cracklin Oat Bran for me!) read some webcomics, and sleepdrove to Sammycaine's father's house, to deliver the kiddo to them.   Now I have my peace, my alone time, I'm kind of a car guy, I like cars, fast cars. I drive a Dodge Stratus ES, with Autostick. So I'm bumping out the Need For Speed Underground soundtrack through my car stereo with the windows down and the autostick engaged, doing some high intensity driving to work. which unfortunately is only 10 minutes away, but this kind of thing wakes me up, gets the blood flowing.   Work has been light enough today for me to write over 90% more today than I did yesterday. Go Figure.  For the curious I'll leave you all with a list of my webcomics I read day to day.  urlLink User Friendly  - a ISP tech comic  urlLink pvp online  = a game magazine behind the scenes comic  urlLink NuklearPower  - original final fantasy with a humorous twist  urlLink Penny Arcade  Penny Arcade, a twisted vantage on Gaming  urlLink MegaTokyo  - an Anime style gaming oriented comic  urlLink /GU Comics  - A MMORPG Comic  urlLink WTF Comics  - a Everquest related Comic   everyone try not to feed the stupid people...

      In my previous article I mentioned I play everquest, and that the reason behind my everquest playing was more complicated than a person merely wishing to play something and buying it from the store. Let me go into detail on what brought me to this addictive entertaining game.  For those that do not know, Everquest is a online game, a game you play with multiple people from all over the internet. It carries a monthly fee of $12.95. It is a roleplaying game, or a game where you play as someone potentially different than yourself acheiving goals to progress the game story as a whole. There is no clear way to "win", you make the decision as to whether you are winning in terms of how satisfied you are with each play session.  I had at one point in time told myself I would never pay money to buy a game, then pay money to play it per month. I decided that this was a waste of money because there are plenty of free games to play online, where all you pay for is the original software. This attitude changed however because of a friend of mine.  This friend is one of my old buddies from when I was in the military. we used to gather weekly for Dungeons and Dragons which I ran, and he was a really cool individual. He is a Air Traffic Controller for the Air Force. Well eventually he got called to duty in Iraq maintaining the bagdad air field. He was gone for many months, and every month he was there I worried about his welfare.   Eventually he did come home, and he let me know that he was back. I was excited to see him again! First night he returned and was settled in enough he came by, while SammyCaine was with her dad wasting his money away at the casinos in Iowa. He brought his computer as we figured we might hook up to my internet service, and play some games or something. When he arrived, he brought Everquest with him, the Planes of Power Disc to be specific. He had told me at that time that if I wanted I could install it and play with him on it and that it was free for the first month, and if I didn't like it I could give him back the discs and the account and he'd give it to another person. Since there was apparently no risk to this scenario, I decided what the heck, I would find out what all the hype was about.  I installed Everquest, patch took 20 minutes or so, while it was doing that we played a little hockey on my Playstation 2. Then we eventually got my account setup. We both decided to play new characters(as he was a long time player of the game) on the server he specified. That night I setup a human Monk(melee class style of play) and he setup a human Wizard, and we started in the same city. it went okay first night, we played a bit had a decent time trying to kill things we should've known not to, and we got offline for the night.   The next day was a day off, I think I had a 3 day weekend, and my friend had to run errands. So bored but semi-fascinated by this game, I decided to create a new character just for myself to play on. I built a Male Dwarf Paladin named Ziggur. Paladin's seemed kind of cool, and I like dwarves, so I thought why not. played that character for a while, and noticed how much more fun this character was, not to mention I started doing quests, which are little missions that garner decent rewards in everquest. When my buddy returned for the night, he decided it would be more fun to play with my paladin than my monk, so I scrapped the monk and played the Paladin all the time while he was there.   Turns out that my friend was stationed with a guy in an Everquest guild(a group of players playing together to acheive greater goals) and he got us invited in. This dramatically improved the gameplay experience, as now I had a greater pool of people with who to talk to, who seemed really cool, and were always very helpful for a new player like myself.   Eventually my friend had to go back to the typical military grind, and eventually stopped playing everquest. I however played it for hours every night. So much so, that my fiance began to feel neglected. I had heard of EQ addiction and the effects on the home, so I always kept myself alert to this situation and corrected it everytime it popped up. But eventually I convinced her to try it(after we bought a second computer to play games together online) and she liked it, she liked it so much she bought Everquest evolutions that same night, I had already bought that plus the Lost Dungeons of Norrath to open up all the spots on the Everquest map for me to play with. She was hooked.  Now I've made friends with a warrior and shaman in our guild, and we go out almost every night adventuring. my Dwarf just made level 40 last night and I have 7 other characters, maxing out the number of characters I can play on any given server.   I don't know what my friend is doing now, sometimes I wish he'd stayed playing so we could group together, but he's just that way. playing different MMORPG's and hopping between them as one gets stale. All I can do is thank him for giving us an experience, that my fiance and I can share, and keeps us entertained till way late at night.   Why do I play everquest? It's not the world that keeps me involved, it's the time I spend with good friends exploring that world.   Try not to feed the stupid people... Phoenix

      Well, since I won't be able to play EQ most of the days of the weekend, I've decided I'm going to make some of the utilities to work on my project portable, so I can take them on my USB flash drive to my Father in Laws house to work on my D&D adventure, as well as my website, so hopefully I'll have a website draft finished and ready to post by end of weekend and perhaps the complete background story of my D&amp;D campaign fully drafted and ready to go, depends on how much quiet time I get to do this work. expect more blogs as the weekend continues.

      Don’t let the previous blog from Pheonix fool you. Yes it is true that SOS came within minuets of our phone call. Yes they did make the suffocating AC blow large amounts of air. However it is not nice refreshing cool air. It is warm stagnant air. Our AC is broken. So I called the landlord. I told her my AC thinks it’s a heater and needs moral support and perhaps a psychologist. She told me that she will call SOS again. So I wait and wait. I wait for an hour. Where are my SOS guys, my large staff of people that are just waiting to serve my every need and whim. Where are the people who show up before I even know I have a problem? No where. I call them. They tell me that perhaps they can fix it by next week. They don’t seem to sure of themselves. I ask them why? Perhaps they need moral support, I will defiantly give them moral support to fix my identity challenged AC. They say that some things need to come together. Like what? What kind of an answer is that? ‘Some things need to come together.’ Do they need head? Who do I have to blow to get my AC fixed?  Last night was the worst. I enjoy playing EQ. It’s my lifetime goal to play EQ for an entire night, from kid asleep to kid up time. Oh yeah, that’s my life. Last night however it was 90 in my house and 70 outside. I couldn’t hack it. Perhaps I wasn’t strong enough or maybe my biological needs of fresh air and cool breezes out weighed the health and welfare of my group. I felt bad yet when I went outside for a smoke and felt the sweat that was rolling down my chest and in between my boobs freeze in the cool night breeze and I actually shivered. EQ didn’t have a thing to sitting on the deck outside reveling with nature.  Akcron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

      Well, despite the best efforts of the speedy SOS Heating and Air person, we are still without AC. Not his fault really, since apparently the Air Conditioner's Compressor is grounding out, or grinding out. If it's grounding out, that would mean the wires that supply the Compressor with power is contacting something else metal, and instead of the electricity getting to the compressor, it's going the quickest route to ground, which is the roof. If it is Grinding out, well then I would guess the compressor Pump's bearings blew out and the pump is grinding and not doing any good. Why the confusion as to which is which? because it seems that Technology Repair Specialists have the mandatory requirement to have the handwriting of Doctors. This is why I type instead of write most of the time, but for some reason, these guys never seem to have a computer capable of printing out an invoice. so instead I get this poorly written slip of paper that says&nbsp; "Compressor is (grounding?/Grinding?) out, Cond. needs Replaced."  The other problem with this is that they didn't give us an estimated time of completion of replacing this equipment. We called our landlord, who is going to call them to kick them in the rear, and we called the SOS ourselves, and their answer to us was they're not sure it'll we fixed all week! and with 85 Degrees all the rest of the week, it's gonna start baking me and my computers :( which sucks. I probably should have turned off my computer, but I didn't, will have to start doing that the rest of the week. hopefully all the fans in my system will keep the system chilled.   What also ticks me off is that I may not be able to play EQ this weekend, because we're taking refuge up in my Father in Law's house, which I assign the standard "nice place to visit" clause. As in, it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. They only have a PS2 for gaming, the computer is off limits for gaming and even anything short of basic internet access.   Now those who know me know that I cannot live without my computer, I want to at least be productive, but all I can forsee me doing at her dad's place is drooling on the couch watching the kid get in trouble. And frankly that Blows goats, I'd rather go to work than be nothing more than a slave to the child. I have needs to, and I guess they just won't be met this weekend, this weekend will be hell in a cell. might as well be in prison.   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      Mood: Refreshed, happy  Finally got sleep last night, we were only going to nap for an hour and join our friends in EQ, but when the pillows were hit, it was ALL over. woke up at 8:30am this morning refreshed and sweaty, because our AC was broken, called the Landlord who then called SOS heating and AC, who showed up not 15 minutes after we called. Very good response, if you live in Nebraska, give them a ring, they do good work.  Anyway, today I'm striving to expand my mind, I'm reading up on Cascading Style Sheets. I'm an old HTML horse, and CSS is too new for me, however I know how XML works, figure that out :P  So I'm surfing the sites about CSS, so that I can practice with it so I can put up the Phoenix Perch Website, which once I do, will be linked here. It's content obviously going to be more static than the information you can find here. Things like my Resume, and Flash Apps and such :D Looking forward to doing some Flash type stuff, I might even make animated EQ comics, who knows, depends on how much time I dedicate to playing with flash apps.  I'll let you know the progress on the website as it happens. till then.   Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      mood: Damn Tired, but happy   3rd night in a row sleep has been so short, I might as well not be sleeping. Past 3 nights I've gotten all of 4 hours of sleep, without a nap the next day. First couple of nights were my fault I admit, last night was just craziness, here I am, all set to go to bed at 2am, which is a perfectly good bed time for me 6 hours of sleep is just fine. Any less and I approach critical mass, start getting headaches and stuff. Kid has a nightmare and starts wailing, and now the house can't get to sleep until he does, which is right around 4am :( not fun.   I wake up at 8am, hit the snooze, thinking, hey, we can live with 30 more minutes of sleep. It turned into 9am without my knowledge, and me and Akcron tear off, we get out the door in less than 15 minutes, and when I get to work I setup my computer while reading the new deadlands book my best buddy gave me, and suddenly, I realized how hard it was to read. couldn't read a damn thing, eyes were blurry for a good 1 1/2 hours before clearing up.   So I've been reading up on deadlands, produced by Pinnacle, it's a pretty interesting tabletop roleplaying game, and I look forward to playing it, I'm going to probably make a couple of characters for the game to see what character I like.   Been in a writing mood lately, I wish I had access to my roleplaying master at work, I'd get more accomplished, but then again I really do need my D&D books to write effectively(as they provide the standard NPC's and major characters of D&amp;D) anyway, this weekend it'll be time to write more for my game, so look at my other blog  urlLink Nefarnomicon  for more information. Also been hungry to write my Website so I may start that task tonight or sometime real soon, going to add it to my Outlook Tasks.  more to come as I think of it.

      I have to admit I am now an addict. Whenever I am at work, eating, giving Zack a bath I think of playing EQ. Even when I am sleeping – I dream of EQ. Last nights dream started like a normal twenty something mom of a toddler dream.   I was riding in the backseat of my Grandparents car with Zack, who for some reason was around two months old. The only minorly strange thing here was that Zack was extremely young and I have seen these particular Grandparents in forever, yet this is normal dream strangeness. So we’re driving down a rode in some unknown ghetto little town and I notice that Zack isn’t buckled into his car seat. This kind of freaked me out because I’m am a slightly paranoid and overprotective mom. So I yell at them to pull over and they yell back ‘Just buckle him up.’ So I try and realize that the metal parts to the straps are broke off. This angers me so I’m slightly dream pissy and yell at them to go to Walmart so I can buy another one. After a long argument that ghetto rural towns don’t have a Walmart they concede because I am all-knowing and I know where one is. (Hey, it my dream!)   As we are driving down this dirt road the town disappears and there is a huge ditch on the side of it. My Grandpa is driving and he just kind of pops into the back seat to help with the car seat, maybe jiggy-rig it to work for a couple of miles. Just as it dawns on me that no one is driving I look out the window and yell ‘DITCH!’ Then we fall, forever, and land on a tree branch about 1/3 of the way down the ditch with long yellow grass weeds getting caught in my hair. I think for a second about huge bugs and fleas just leaping on my head and going to town before I pull Zack out and of the ghetto car seat and leave the car. Just then my Grandma tells me ‘Don’t pull on the grass.’ I tell her its sturdy enough. Just as I do the grass breaks and Zack and I fall and land on another tree branch near bottom of the ditch. Somehow we are just fine and Zack is still asleep. So I sit on the branch. The height is just high enough that you know you will break a leg if you jump down yet you still debate if you really should. I hate that height it’s such a mind boggler. Yet I sit and wait, I don’t know for what.   Just then a town appears in the distance with a police station on the outskirts. Fantastic! I get up and jump up and down yelling for help. A young male cop comes over and so I ramble on about all that happened and all he says is ‘Alright.’ I get kind of mad when at the end of my speech he’s still standing there saying ‘Alright.’ So I ask him if he has a ladder or some rope, he just looks at me, says ‘Alright’ again and walks off. Now I really consider jumping, but before I do my dream turns into EQ, complete with windows and chat channels and my Grandparents OOC the zone with ‘Don’t Aggro the Cops in this Zone unless you have Vah Shir Stat FOOD!’ Now I’m panicked. I’m stuck in a tree with a baby without any stat food at all and no temp or any HP buff at all to cushion my fall. I’m even OOM for some reason or another. I sit and try to med really, really fast cursing all the enchanters that are in the zone and to scared to come give me clarity.  Then the cop comes back with the mayor. I look up and my Grandparents have already ported out, damn wizards. The mayor looks nice, he’s smiling and laughing, though it is an election year so that explains that. And good God they con red. Me, a cleric, and a kid facing reds. I decide the best plan of attack is to just go with the flow till mana charges for a gate. They get me down and take me to their police station. It’s full of con yellows to reds and election year posters. They ask me to join their guild to put the mayor on the throne again and take up their quests. I deny I just can’t join the side of evil. They go agro.  Just at this moment Zack wakes up and then I wake up. I kick Pheonix. I tell him something jumbled about how I need to make some stat food so I wont die and he tells me to go back to sleep. Yet, somehow I cant because all I can think about is how to make Vah Shir stat food.

      Mood: Impatient  This day just doesn't seem to end, I want to go home, take a quick cat nap and finish my epic sword in Everquest. I got up today at 9:55 AM, I had to be at work at 10:00am, if that tells you anything about this morning. Got up, threw on clothes and out the door with tea in hand.  Finally got more tea, my body thanks me. After drinking mostly Soda for a long time, the Tea just gives me a much greater feeling of contentment, something Soda never does. Got an hour left of work, I've read all my web comics, and I'm kicking myself because I cannot seem to figure out what to write in my Ziggur Blog. I had a pretty good time, despite the fact my buddy Kretais was out most of the day. I spent the entire day out with Guild members on various assualts for my fiance and my pieces to spell quests, and finished the last portion of my soulfire drops. Spent the last part of the night with Kretais farming Sashes, which turned out rather well later in the night.   Tonight I've got more sashes to do, then once the busy work is out of the way(25+ sashes) then I've gotta finish getting my epic sword with it's 5 complete heals. need to also take the time to write up a Zblog and do some work on my Adventure for D&D.  Oh yeah, a follow up on my organization skills. I actually sat down and completed about 5 % of the D&D origin story. Thinking about posting the collective thoughts of this D&amp;D Project on a seperate blog, using it kind of as a white board/forum for comments from readers.   But then again, isn't that just more for me to keep up with? So much to do, so little time in wake filled life to do it. isn't that always the case? maybe that's why I stay up till 4am and get up at 8am at times. 4 hours of sleep, some say it's unhealthy, I say it's the only way I can get anything done. I'll sleep when I'm retired or dead. That's my motto, there's too much in this world to experience or do, to simply spend 1/3 of my life asleep.  Consider it maximizing effeciency. As long as it doesn't affect my work quality, and as long as I can avoid passing out at my desk, I will continue to min/max my life.  For those who do not know the definition of min/max  Min/Max -   Abbv of Minimum/Maximum - origin: Roleplaying Game Slang  - 1. A person who does the minimum to acheive the maximum result. 2. A method of spending the least to get the most. 3. A person who takes advantage of a system to achieve maximum results with the lowest possible side effects.  &nbsp; Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      mood: silly, wacky even, and peaceful.  &nbsp;  Today has been pretty hectic here at work, the problem with the phones at our work continues so we keep getting calls flowing into our dept that should not be. but those things happen. Aside from that I've been keeping up with  urlLink The Newbie Zone , the Everquest forum of personal choice. making comments when I have time, and also keeping up my other blogs.  &nbsp;  But I made a vow last night while my fiance was tucked into bed, that I needed to organize my life and priorities a little bit. Right now I'm on a pretty ferocious cycle of Sleep, Eat, Work, Eat, EQ, repeat. I have several projects I've been meaning to work on, and I'll explain them a little bit here.  &nbsp;  Dungeons and Dragons Adventure Concept: Nefarnomicon - a detailed campaign world, I've worked on this for over a year now, and I've got the concept world all in my head, and many of the pieces written down in various places. But I need to write this, it's very important to me, but has always been pushed around to being nothing but something in my Outlook ToDo list with nothing to push it past hitting the snooze button for the thousanth time. I built this world, with my bare hands, from the original goddess, to the various races, when they came into being, what drove them to be how they are, etc. and no of it is organized or complete! grr, that angers me sometimes that I let it get away from me. It's going to be stupendous to play, and maybe, when I'm done I can submit it to WotC for publication and if that happens, well, money is always good :D  &nbsp;  Shadowrun Covert Operations Suite: a package software much like the  urlLink RolePlaying Master  I typically use for the Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted to put my coding skills to decent use and make a tool I could use for designing and laying out things structured easily and offer online access at the same time. So I could run games even with people physically seperated from my game table. I began research into what I would need to do, but didn't move past that stage. &nbsp; The Phoenix Perch Website: I've been meaning to do this for well over 2 years I just haven't spent the time with Flash and Dreamweaver to hammer out the particulars about this site. I figure it may generate more traffic to this page, and give me a place to show off all the screenshots of all the cool stuff I've done in EQ, and link my shirt shops I run non-profit. &nbsp; Organize and catalog my Magic Cards using Magic Workstation: I have 3 binders and a pizzabox sized box of Magic cards, organization of these has always been a chore, however if I could put them into my database, I could sort them easily, and create virtual decks out of my available cards before I even have to touch the dreaded binders.  &nbsp; In an endevour to actually accomplish these fabled tasks obviously I'm going to have to cut back a little on my EQ time, which is suprisingly easy to do, in small increments. I have started to place things in my Outlook Tasklist a little more broken down, instead of "organize all magic cards into MTGW" I have "append and organize the black cards into the database" and I give myself 2 full weekends to accomplish even these broken down tasks, and I can extend that as necessary, but I'm going to try to force myself to accomplish at least 10% of any given task per weekend, so that I am making progress, even if it is slow and steady. We'll see how it goes next weekend.  &nbsp; more to come later, &nbsp; Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      Well this weekend was a hot one for Zack and I. We went off to our family reunion right outside of North Platte at the lake. It was a scorcher. The weather man said it was supposed to rain all weekend yet the little man and I showed our pale bods about every two hours as we walked to the beach for a dip.  &nbsp;  The little man surprised me a good one too. I knew he liked to swim, however I didn’t know he was suicidal. He has taken a liking to jumping off of rafts and boats. He has also learned to like his Spidey life jacket. Suicidal is fine with the appropriate life saving devices.  &nbsp;  Another big concern for us was quarters; you know it those round silver 25 cent pieces of valued coins. Not only are they there to clean your laundry, yet they can also be used for showers. Fifty cents is about 2 mins. I now take a 3 minute shower. Oh yeah, I'm good.&nbsp;However those coins are the new gold. If I wasn’t the one going around begging for the damn things I would be the one selling 50 cents in quarters for 5 dollars. Bet I’d get it too. Zack, on the other hand, has grown to hate water falling out of the sky. He thinks the sky is falling, or the oceans raining down or any other paranoid version of Henny Penny he can think up. He really trips a big one. Raging toddler tantrums from hell, face red through minor sun burn and flaling arms and legs. The showers are cut off of the rest of the bathroom by a curtain. With both of us butt-naked he ran through the curtain and headed for the door, our only towel in his hand. He opens up the door and runs out. Here’s flaming mom, flashing the camp, soaking wet, running after screaming, streaking two year old. Oh yeah, most embarrassing moment, *raises hand* I have the best one.  &nbsp;  NEWAYS – Those are the highlights of our trip. I also have been sleeping since I got back. I’m hoping to do some Ever Cracking tonight. Miss that smash and bash.  &nbsp;  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      Mood: happy and a little tired  I'm full of pride, I've actually made posts for all the blogs I've been writing on, and this is the last one to finish. Akcron is leaving for her family reunion tomorrow morning and she will be missed. Work has been slow paced in terms of calls, but the day is just flashing past me in turbo, I just hope it settles down enough for me to get lots of satisfaction out of my Everquest tonight. I'm going to read some comedy links at the  urlLink EQ Forums  which have been really funny so far, so if you're a huge EQ nut, give it a peek. You'll enjoy it. Anyway, not too many thoughts to comment on other than my pride and current events, if something comes up you'll see another blog from me :)   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      Life the world and nothing. I’m none too happy today. Its really for no particular reason at all either. I just don’t feel the need to be up and yuppie today.   Today I want to talk about boobs. I used to hate the male (and female) obsession of boobs. So much so that I wore baggy clothes and was called a variety of names from a dude, to a dike to a guy continuously. Well meaning strangers would kindly tell me that I was entering the wrong restroom for my own safety. I simply did not want to be a piece of meat. I wanted to be known for my charming personality and quick wit. Yes, you know it, I rarely got a date. (Love ya Pheonix)   Then a dress code change came into work. No baggy clothes, I was upset and mortified. I felt like my old ratty boss wanted to see my boobs. I contemplate going for sexual harassment, Pheonix talked me down and told me that boobs, yes wonderful are actually sources of infinite power if used correctly. I decided to hone this power and use it for good and not evil.   It’s been working pretty well too. I get days off of work and if I wear just the right shirt, nobody really cares if I’m late. (Only girl in the workplace.) The best thing that I have done with my boobs was sell my car. It was a ratty 150,000 mile totaled Ford Taurus. It wasn’t always like that though. I loved that car. It went through my rebellion years with me. But hasn’t been driven since. Two years ago at about 5am I was blazed and driving home to crash. I was also stopped at a red blinking stoplight. I waited. I rocked to a number of songs headbanging in my car and bellowing along. I waited some more. Finally a little voice in my head whispered, ‘it’s a red BLINKING stoplight.’ I turned down the music and the little voice told me, ‘at a red BLINKING stoplight you must Stop Look Both Ways and Proceed.’ I felt like I was in the Field of Dreams. I looked around the car, no one there. ‘DO IT!’ yelled the voice. Then it finally dawned on me. It’s a RED BLINKING STOPLIGHT. I hit myself in the head and ran into the intersection. Then  I saw it. A bright orange Scooby Doo van, it hit me, I turned three full circles and stopped on the other side of the intersection exactly as if I had stopped, looked both ways, proceeded and stopped on the other side of the intersection. I was wondering why  I would do that. Why would I stop on the OTHER side of the intersection?   As I was scrambling in my head for some weird law concerning this Boone, my best invisible friend from when I was a kid, popped up on my steering wheel and said ‘DUUUDE! You totaled your car MAN!’ I told him I didn’t and asked him where he had went I missed him. As we were catching up on old times there was a knock on my window. I thought that was just kinda rude to interrupt a conversation but I decided to be polite. I rolled down my window. The guys asked me if I was ok, I told him I was just talking with Boone. He looked around the car, obviously only seeing me since Boone is my invisible best friend, and said ‘Don’t move. The ambulance is on its way.’ Then it dawned on me, I’m 23 and talking to an invisible friend, I’m insane.  So that’s how I wrecked my car with no registration, no insurance, expired plates. I didn’t even get a ticket, I got a court date. The Judge I got was really, well weird. His grandson had just won a spelling bee and he told everyone awaiting punishment that if they congratulated him he’d go easy on them. I watched as people went up most of them getting thousand dollar fines or jail. It rang in my head ‘jail’, ‘prison’, ‘jail’, prison’. I hated high school I sure as hell was NOT going to prison. I was too young and too cute. It was my turn. I had to pee. I walked up there and stood in front of the judge hanging my head and doing the pee dance. Then I looked up to him and thought I was looking at God, you feel really lame and little when you look at God. But I did stuttered a congratulations to his grandson.  God smiled at me and said ‘What did you do.’ I told him. He asked me why. I said I didn’t know but was really, really sorry. I think a tear fell then. He smiled again and gave me a warning and not to drive for a while as a punishment. He didn’t suspend my license or anything just kind of like a warning for a toddler. I was ecstatic. I couldn’t believe it. I left while another person was being put in jail. I was invincible.   Well back on the main story I just paid off my piece of shit car and found out that since it wasn’t ‘under cover’ ie under anything including a towel, I owe registration and back taxes. So I marched down to the court house in my boob shirt, waved them in front of a really lonely ugly guy and got them waved. He just told me to sell the car or give it away, also not to tell anyone who he was. So I did and the over a grand of fines and fees are waved and I got a profit of 200.00 from flashing my boobs to my Mom’s old boyfriend.   I like boobs.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      I am sick and tired of God playing praticle jokes on me. You step outside from the AC and it feels humid yet temperate. You walk the mandatory 50 ft away from the building and step into the shade the temperture falls to a humid yet lovely 10 degrees cooler.You light your ciggarrette. As you puff away you think to yourself, 'Whats everyone bitching about? Its not that bad out here." It becomes a little hotter as you sit on the bench puffing away till it gets to a humid yet slightly a little too warm. You feel slightly suffocated since people with asthma really shouldnt smoke especially in humidity so you do your lungs a favor and put out the ciggarette. You step outside the shade and WHAMMO! Gods sick twisted little mind thinks that it will be funny to make the temparture go up to a stifling 98 degrees with max humidity. Its like a punishment for smoking too long when your not supposed to have that break. It's 50 feet back to the door. You think you should run, but your feet just cant. You trudge to the doorway, hair falling and laying flat on your head trapping the humidity on your skull, your bangs start leaking sweat into your eyes and your makeup starts running in turrents. You now look like crap. Coworkers will know you went on an illegal break and now you stink. You get to the door, you forgot to punch the handicap button five feet away and this door is heavy. You try to tell your arm to open the door, your arm rebels. Your tell your feet turn around, the buttons right there do arm a favor. Your feet say 'Fuck you and the arm, We just walked 50 feet.' You stand there in a debate with feet and arm looking like an idiot staring at all the nice AC'd people inside while God is up there laughing at you with Michel and the boys. You picture Michel putting back Hard Lemonade say 'Crank it Jesus, Crank it some More!' It gets hotter. Finally the arm gives in and you walk under that mandatory whiff of AC right by the door. Feels nice yet now the running makeup and sweat under your armpits freezes into a stinky sticky gell.   Is smoking worth it? Must be because I'm about to have another. God ... Bring It On!

      mood: agitated and bored Okay Okay, can't let Akcron take the entire stage that I built :P I know it's been a while since I said even hello to you all. But I must say I am annoyed by this blog tool, looks like they fixed the random unable to display this page issue. But I just wrote a blog post for my other blog  urlLink Ziggurs Camp , my everquest character blog, and it ate it! I went to hit publish, and the thing session timed out. grumble, oh well, nothing I can do but be annoyed. I'm at work, contemplating the idea of putting hydraulics on cars, and why they don't put hydraulics on saturns or something. I mean you'd get more bounce in a lighter car :P   Anyway, I apologize to those who read my Ziggur Camp blog, but you'll just have to wait longer for the most current post.   Also of note, Akcron is leaving for a weekend with the family at a family reunion, I won't be going with her because of financial reasons, so I'll be posting all the antics while she's gone ;P honestly might not be much, but you never know what a lonely guy might do :P   Anyway, more to come later on as stories progress.  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      That night was one of many oddities.   I had forgotten my badge at home and was sent to pick it back up so that the freshman could address me appropriatly and ask me inane questions. On my way back to work I saw a homeless man on the street with a sign that read 'Anything will help, even if it is only a dollar.' Well, all I had was a dollar on me and was feeling charitable so I pulled over in a grocery store parking lot and ran across Dodge to give it to the guy. All the sayings of saftey and girls being tormented that my mother has told me over the past 23 years ran through my mind, yet I was on a mission to give this poor homeless man my dollar. I get there and hand the guy my buck, apologize I dont have more and turn around. He yells at me to wait. I see the zooming car run past my nose then turn, smile and say thanks. He grabs my hand bends down and kisses it. I'm astonished and a little grossed out but hey, he doesnt exactly have a bath and a toothbrush. But the thing is that he wont let go of my hand. I know Judo, I'm a black belt, I'd feel guilty about beating up a homeless guy but ya know I really wouldnt care. I tell him to let go first I think that you should warn everyone before breaking thier noses and kicking them in the nuts. But before I can even get out, 'Let go of me or I'll beat you senseless.' he starts jabbering about steaks and shrimp. I tell him again that all I have is a dollar. He points to the grocery store and says a dollar doesnt buy much these days, he wants a steak. I'm bewildered, I cant beleive that this hobo wants me to buy hima bloody Bew Yourk Strip! If I buy anyone else a New York Strip I better be fucking them, and I dont have sex with people who dont bathe regualarly. I get my hand back, he places my dollar back in it. I tell him my long story about how my credit card wont accept anything but ciggarrettes or gas. (I know laugh it up. My bank is ghetto and my card declines at random intervals. Its annoying but I just take heart in knowing I have the only credit card with a personality.)I give him my dollar back. He starts to get angry, he wants a steak. I tell him to save all the dollars that he gets and he can buy his own steak. He gets pissed. I ask for my dollar back. I get it, flip him off and run back to my car. You know, I wasnt exactly wanting a big gush of emotion over my puny little dollar, I wasnt even wanting a thankyou from schizophrenic homeless men but that was just a little too much. I mean the sign said any money, even a dollar. Really its false advertising, I should sue for his box. I head off to work wondering how to summons a homeless man to court.  When I get there I buy myself a Mountain Dew with MY dollar, see still works for little stuff, and head in. Here I see the freshman class for Creighton University, dressed in the lastest fads, hair sleek and shiny apparently not homeless.  I got an email from the President of the University today to treat these future lawyers and doctors well because they are the highest of their classes with the best SAT's and honors (they are also paying the most since tuition just raised by 5,000 dollars). These future doctors and lawyers however are smooshed together in a big circle jumping up and down and shouting out the words to TuPok and Ja Rule. Its quite comical because half the songs their belting out actually say how much the singer and the ghetto peeps want to shoot them and take out their liver.   Thier probably all Republicans too. I hate republicans just like I hate spiders. Simply out of neccessity and reason.  Have fun - dont kill yourselves  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      Today has been both eventful and uneventful. I woke up today and Pheonix and I had a wonderful miscommunication. One of those stupid little things that seem to be so important at the time yet when you look back at it you realize that you just need to grow up. Who cares who has the keys when your both going to the same place and why in the hell do when you put on your shoes really matter in the long run? Not a clue but this morning those things seemed to be at the top of my list of priorities. If I ever get a divorce or break up with Pheonix I want it to be about more than just shoes and keys on the table.   Besides the chatastophes of this morning I am working 17 hours straight today and into tommorrow. Today at Crieghton University's DOIT (Division of Information and Technology) we are holding GameFest, a bigger and better LAN party for all incoming sniveling whining bratty freshman that I hate more and more each day. I want to make a t-shirt that says, 'Please dont bring your 80's computer to Crieghton. It sucks and so do you.' My job today is to haul 5 plasma tv's and 40 Gateway computers three blocks across campus. My shoulders hurt, my arms have fallen off, I'm tired and I'm on break. I'm sitting here bitching in my blog about this and that and the other thing while random people are coming up to me. 'Can you fix my computer?' 'I cant get connected.' 'Where is the nearest wireless connection?' Dude I'm on break. Just because I work for DOIT does not meen that I like people. I tried to ignore them but then it seemed that they multiplied like mold on cheese. I want to charge money, $5.00 to see the on break DOIT person. I bet your asking 'how do they know you work for DOIT? Do you have a sign above your head?' Almost but not quite entirely unlike tea there. I have a big sign on my shirt. In large bold letters across my back and chest my shirt yells DOIT to the masses. I'm going to apply ducttape to it today. It's not even a nice colored shirt. It reminds me of a janitor or an industrial worker. I feel like I should be scrubbing toilets and not crawling around on the floor hooking cables into walls and explaning what a Desktop and a window is to estranged students. (Yes, that really happened I just got through talking to them. He wasnt even 50, he was a sniveling freshman.)  However I too have a tendency to digress as well and my break is over. More on the fantasies of DOIT later.  Ackron --- shoot the stupid people.

      Attitude: bored Mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight  Been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. however it's good to see Tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :)   Not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but I had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday I'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. but I digress.  Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining. I took one myself in fact, but then again I'm used to it. early Basic Training and later Field exercises were both sans hot water, and thus we got to enjoy the blasts of cold water. I rate our current shower scenario a 2 out of possible 10 where 10 is the warmest. I use the showers in the field as the coldest this side of a snowball.   Anyway, we did more EQ last night and will do more probably tonight as is what is typical, so expect more ziggur camp blogging to ensue.

      Hello world, this is Ackron/Tigger_On_Crack. Yes, yes I am undecided on which name  I’m going to choose so I’ll use this one for right now. I don’t think it will be too confusing for the world at large to associate two names for one person, especially if they play EQ and can understand the concept of ALT’s.   Well, my morning was interesting today. I am used to lying in bed with the sounds of Kermit and Cookie Monster going off in the background till I have to wake up at about 9 or so. This morning however I was awakened by a sippy cup bashing me repeatedly in the head. Unbeknownst to me my son just figured out how to open doors and really, really wanted a drink. I guess he felt the need to go agro on me. I swear the sippy cup has to do lethal damage. *touches tender eye* So there I was black eye on the way, Pheonix still sleeping peacefully and a two-year old on rampage. First thought through my head is “this is too painful to be a dream” second thought “how in the hell do men sleep?”  When Son was born he slept through midnight roll calls, he sleeps through tornado alarms, now he’s sleeping through 7am juice requests. Is there some sort of biological chemistry that the female brain simply neglected to give us or is God still pissed about that God-damned peice of rotten fruit? I wonder if the man who got his dick chopped off slept through that as well. Anyways, I get up and give the kid a drink. I think if he is smart enough to get out of his room and strong enough to give me a black eye then he can get his own drink. Get a chair, spill it on the floor if he doesn’t drown I don't care.  Now is the second dilemma of the morning. How do you put a 2 year old back in bed when they can open up the door with out having well intending neighbors and Grandmothers call CPS? Not sure. It's 7am, my thought processes just are not booting. So I let him in my room and tell him that I’m going to sleep. He seems fine with that and why not? I never let him in my room it’s a no-kid zone and not baby/toddler proof at all. So as I lay staring at the ceiling with Zack merrily sipping on his fucking juice and staring at all of his new toys that he gets to randomly destroy, horrible thoughts start to pile through my head. He could climb on my desk chair, fall and get a concussion, go Evil Kinevil off my desk and into the pile of forbidden laundry, fall into my closet and enter a second dimension of reality never to be seen again (nice thought at the time I stuck with that one for a while) electrocute himself with the outlets under my desk. I get up again and try to convince the rampaging toddler to sleep with me on the bed. He body slams Pheonix who finally wakes up. Not bad, there is something that will wake him up besides sex. Now we’re all up. Fun. I decide to go to work early.  For the past weekend our water heater has been broken. Nice lovely landlord from hell has been promising a fix ‘the next day’ since the end of June. I feel like a pioneer woman, heating the water before cooking and bathing and ice showers. Son is the luckiest out of us all and gets an invitation to have a nice bath at Grandma’s house. I’m so jealous. What are my boobs not as speacial as the kid? Do they not deserve love? Guess not. For all the men who don't have boobs picture your testicles without the turtle feature then take a shower in falling ice cubes. Time to take another. I yip as I get in and Pheonix laughs. Never laugh at a woman with frozen nipples. Rage ensues. I'll leave it at that.  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Back-up!

      Been having trouble writing this post, simply because I don't want to bore you with too many of the crappy details. Sometime's I'm just too perfectionist for my own good.  I just want to say for the record money sucks.  Or rather, that being out of money sucks.  For me, money = confidence, at least the confidence of being secure in your position in life. When money tides roll out, you start to notice the rocks that you're narrowly avoiding, that will cause you to sink to the next lowest lifestyle. We're Working class anyway, which is a pretty big group of people who make almost enough to live on without working ourselves to the bone, and so we also have good reason to dread going further down the monetary based caste system of america.   when the budget works, life is good, I'm usually more pleasant, I sleep better, and don't feel bad if I go to Burger King for a lil meal here and there.   It's when the budget breaks that I feel like a 10 ton gorilla is sitting in my pocket where my wallet was. That ten ton gorilla makes me hesitate spending any money, even for food. because I know if I buy food, then I can't afford a bill, or if I pay that bill, I'll not have much in the fridge.   I never was good at carnival tricks, but since I got started out in the real world(read: not sheltered military world protected from such things as rent and power bills) I've gotten pretty damn good at juggling.  I don't think there's a single working class citizen out there that hasn't gotten a "last chance before we repo/disconnect/cancel/eviction your (insert reason for bill here)" once and a while, and I'm sure more than a few have had it happen that the company actually goes through with it. but if it can be helped, a working class person will avoid the disconnect/repo/cancel at all costs. because as soon as you get disconnected, usually they need an insane deposit, and 2 months up front. and if you couldn't afford the bill initially and it got cut off, then how are you going to afford to turn it back on? rob a bank?   So you learn to juggle, the art of letting one bill slide into being late or even into the next bill you get from that company, so you can pay other bills and still eat. Then the next month you pay the late+new bill from that one company, and let the company you paid the month before slide. and by doing this you really only pay for a handful of stuff at at time, while the other stuff becomes late. then you pay the late, and let the current slide, this prevents a disconnect, because the disconnect usually only happens after 2 months of unpaid bills.   The problem comes when even with juggling, your still leaking money from somewhere, those bill-balls start turning into bowling balls, and later flaming machetes. you end up getting tired of the juggling, and you just wish you could let all the balls drop without repercussions. Right now I'd say that I'm at the bowling ball stage, but I've been here before, and so my juggling skills here are not too bad. I'm pretty sure I'll live, but it won't be comfy for another month my guess would be.  See, I think this post came out really well, better than the other 4 drafts :P just be glad I didn't torture you with those. They were incredibly boring, and well, I figure if you're going to post anything it had better be at least semi interesting, and not some detailed ramble that gets more than the point across. :P  Anyway, Even Everquest was tragic last night, check out my Ziggurscamp Blog for details  urlLink Ziggur's Camp   try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      Mood: relaxed  well, looks like SammyCaine has decided to go by another of her aliases, Tigger_On_Crack. one of these days I'm sure she'll make a post(even if I have to prod her to do so :P) so future posts will reflect her choice in names.  Well the 4th went pretty well for us. I worked for the day(time and a half woohoo) which is okay since all the good stuff happens at night anyway. I went directly to my soon to be father in laws where Tigger and my Son had been hanging out most of the day. I had a beer and relaxed for a bit, while the ladies made macaroni salad. and I must say I'm not usually a terribly huge fan of a lot of people's recipes for egg based salads. but this macaroni salad is pretty good. and Tigger has learned the art of making it, so I'm hoping to see some in my home someday soon :P  I ate Chicken and Potato Wedges and Macaroni salad for dinner, it was very good. and I helped my youngest Brother in Law with smoke bombs and found some unfired black cats amongst the carnage in their backyard. we did this until it was time to go to the big Fireworks show at Harrah's Casino(I still don't know why Iowa wants to pronounce Harrah's (which I pronounce harrah! like when you are applauding something) like Harris. it's not Harris, it's Harrah!) which was very awesome, my son got a kick out of it, and the place we sat at you'd swear the fireworks were going to rain down right on you. they were huge! Very good show. Anyway, we drove back, me being completely dehydrated for a little home fireworks display setup by the brother in laws.   The brother in laws had mortars to fire off, the first couple went off well, then the brother's got the idea to try to link them together 2 at a time. well, when they lit them off, the tube got knocked sideways and the mortar fired off screaming right toward a neighbors house and blew a big scorch mark on the neighbor's garage door. my Father in law was pretty ticked off at what my brother in law did, but my fiance said he would probably just do some free mowing's to cover the expense if any to be had fixing that garage door.  Second botch came right after the first. the littlest brother in law didn't understand how to load a mortar in the tube correctly, so he placed the ball end down, which of course by any who have fired these lovely night time toys, is upside down. He lit it off, and backed away, all the sudden we head the thump of the propellant fire off, but we didn't see the mortar leave the tube, we all screamed for the kid to run away from the tube, and he was almost hit by the flaming sparks as the mortar tube blew into pieces.  After that the evening returned to normal. But I must say a lot of funny and cool things happened that night. it was a blast!   Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      So I saw spidey 2, with my fiance, the biggest fan of Spidey I know, I mean during the whole Spiderman 2 Movie she was bouncing in her seat, raising her arms in celebration and generally being more hyperactive than a lab rat on speed.   The movie features one of Marvel's most malevolent bad guys, Doctor Octopus. It also revolves around the love story of Peter Parker with Mary Jane Watson. A lot of the movie focuses on Spiderman's inner struggle with his own dreams and his duty to being a superhero.   The special effects were really awesome, and on par with the former movie, and the fight scenes between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus are very intense, and features even more property damage than the Hobgoblin fights in the first movie. One of the coolest scenes was the fight on the subway train, very intense and very good special effects. The movie also features a comic relief in Peter Parkers current apartment and his interactions between the landlord.   The movie invokes a wide spectrum of emotion throughout the film, and does it with very good cinematography. if there is anything to complain about in the movie it would be the amount of times that Spidey is without his mask. He reveals himself to too many people in my opinion. A Superhero is supposed to mask his identity, and in the comics does so to a great extent, whereas in the movie he's practically revealing himself to everyone toward the end of the movie.   All in all I recommend seeing this movie, it was very well done, and besides the slight annoyance by the amount of times spidey reveals who he is to people, there is nothing else to dislike about this movie. I give it 5/5 stars, and is a must see movie.

      Mood: Headache, hungry and tired  well my buddy didn't show up this weekend, didn't even call, wonder what happened, anyway, time to go have barbecue and relax with the inlaws as best I can. probably gonna be a short night.  I'll edit this post later and give you more info on my weekend.    -edit-  My buddy didn't show up this weekend, dunno what happened to him, will have to call him up and ask him someday, oh well, things like this happen. And sometimes they disappoint me. This weekend was pretty rough, Friday I spent from the time Sammycaine got up, till around 9pm taking care of the toddler. That much time alone with him can be a little challenging, now compound that with a lack of cigarettes till around 6pm, and you have a recipe for a crappy day. The second day I had to get up to take Sammy's brothers home, at 8:30 am, after spending till 5am playing. 3 hours of sleep, luckily I overslept my alarm, got up at 9:30 instead, so 4 hours of sleep, lil better, drove the brothers home, came back home, and kid was crying and fiance was asleep.  I felt awake, I tend to whenever I get up, I just can't get back to sleep once I've gotten dressed and have met the morning. I have to wait forever before I can even think about taking a nap. Anyway so I stay up, take care of the kid until the fiance wakes, SammyCaine wakes around 2ish, says she feels sick, and went back to bed. I took care of the kid until around 5:30 when Sammy needed to pick up her brothers for babysitting duty. They arrived, I got rushed around the house doing this and that, while I wanted to just chill.  Things started to pick up Saturday after the brothers came over. We took off and went to Taco Bell before we went to a movie. I ordered their new 1/2 lb combo burrito(which I will tell you for a fact, was not 1/2 lb!) a beef grilled stuft burrito(now that's 1/2 lb or more!) and a cheesy gordita crunch(nirvana of cheese to me) and a large Dr Pepper. What do I wind up with? 2 of my items, and I'm missing my fave one, the Cheesy Gordita Crunch, they didn't even ring it up, we checked the receipt, the dude operating the register was a complete idiot, and you could tell when I told him my order, and he waffled it twice and didn't repeat it back to me the last time. Maybe he was new, but new people should be forced to work a night shift before being put on rush periods to ensure they know what they are doing before they handle the tough times of the day. Ah well, I digress.  Now my day was still being crappy, missing my fave item in my bell bag, and then I go to take a swig of the Dr Pepper while driving. SPLASHDOWN! the lid was not Firmly affixed to the cup, and thus, I end up with a Dr Pepper Shower, Ice cold refreshment this was not. more like frosty hands of death while I'm driving. I can't help but laugh at that last part though looking back on it. I dunno just seeing people getting the suprise of their life by being splashed with water when they're not looking always made me at least giggle. but at that time it was pretty crummy, Thanks Taco Bell Stooge! missing parts of my order and not putting the cup lids on correctly! you're fired. Okay I feel better.  Then we saw the movie, Spiderman 2, which I will review in a seperate post. Turned my day around, just snuggling with SammyCaine in the movie(Spiderman is her fave superhero, mine is Punisher) just made my life more complete. we drove away from the show later, and I was no longer as grumpy as I had been the whole day. I didn't care that my buddy didn't even call. I didn't care that I had the kid for 2 days straight. We went to the park after, for a lil while, walked around it looking at artwork. then went home, played more Everquest, and went to bed. so it got better, and everything turned out all right.

      My buddy who got me addicted to everquest contacted me last night, for the first time in a long time I got to talk to him. he's doing decent and been playing City of Heroes(a superhero MMORPG) and has become leader of a top Supergroup(Guild in CoH) I think he's thinking about stopping in tonight or soon to hook up with us and do some LAN gaming. should be a fun time. I'll keep posting the details of the days that we have together, he has a tendency of doing this, since his schedule is so hectic most of the time and he's so occupied, whenever he gets a bunch of days off stretched out for a while(july 4th holiday) he hooks up with us so we can do some serious LAN gaming. it's fun, and it never seems to last long enough. We miss him often when he's gone, and we enjoy every moment that he's in our home. I'll keep you posted as things develop.  Try not to Feed the Stupid People, Phoenix

      Mood: sleepy, but content  I want to wish Sammycaine a warm welcome, she is a shining star in my life, and a welcome addition to the Phoenix Perch crew. She will post her thoughts as they come to her as well. This way not everything has to come out of my mouth :P Welcome SammyCaine, let's get blogging.   Anyway, SammyCaine had most of the adventures last night, she hooked up with an old buddy and went to a bar, she'll probably tell you about that. I had a long day at work yesterday, but a lot of it I spent blogging and surfing, which goes to show just how slow my work place is. I came home, cleaned the house for the arrival of Sammy's friend, and he never showed, then I got on Everquest, made 899 platinum last night helping me break 1k of plat for the first time. I then did some tradeskilling, making smoker's to boost my pottery skill high enough to make prismatic dye's for Sammy's characters.   When Sammy came back, we decided to play our lowbie characters, so I played my necro, which was fun, I played the necro because our regular mage was not playing that night, and the necro has a skeleton that is highly useful in combat when you don't have anyone to tank(take hits) for you.   Ended the night with a pull of 3 giant badger things known as burnies, which almost wiped the whole group. I knew then that it was time to camp for the night. Snuggled in with Sammy for the night, talked about the usual stuff, and went to bed.  Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix
