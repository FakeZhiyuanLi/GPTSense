      Okay, had the day off today *YAY*, so I was sitting here at my desk thinking "Wow, my blog is plain.  I should look to see what kind of neat and nifty things I can add to it".  BIG mistake!  I clicked and read... and clicked and read... and clicked and read... and at the end of an hour long session of staring at various blog pages and stuff, what have I learned?  Nothing!  Nope, nothing... it was in one eye, and out the other basically.  But, on the other hand, I came out of the experience with a nifty lil headache from not blinking.  Maybe some day...  In the meantime though, I can do a quick rundown of the characters in my life.    There's me, obviously.  Then I have my two SpztcKids from a previous mistak... err, marriage.  SK1 and SK2.  Also known as Nick and Brad.  SK3 is still in the process of cooking, but I'm sure she will be mentioned from time to time anyways, as she is wreaking havoc on my body!  LOL  I WON'T go into how she is doing that though.  But she is due to debut on Halloween, the lil diva!  Then we have SK3's dad... David.  We'll refer to him as SKSO for the time being.  He may become Mr. SK, but at this point, I'm still a wee bit on the gun shy side.  And we are happy in our arrangement of living in sin.  ;)  Then the peripherals... as I am sure I'll bitch about my family periodically.  My ma, pa, and sis live a few miles away.  That would be my younger sister, who is only 13, and a major pain in the ass.  But hey, it's cheap daycare.  I also have an older sister, so they will be the B's.  BS (sis), BBIL (bil), and BG1, BG2, BB3, BB4.  Two neices, two nephews.  Hope that makes sense.  Why the B's though?  They are fondly referred to as "The Beans" or "The Beaners".  My sister is half mexican (half sister too), and brother-in-law is full mex.    I may also refer once in a while to Max or Tigger, my cats.  Or my ex-moron, as he pisses me off on a regular basis.  Though with time, his names are liable to become quite inventive.  But for now, ex-moron works.  *takes a bow* And there ya go...

      So, I'm enjoying my sleep, as I'm sure most people do.  It's one of my favorite parts of the day actually!  And of course, as has been the norm for a week or so now, it took me til almost 1am to fall asleep.  Bleh.  Then, of course, we add in being up what felt like every 10 minutes to run to the bathroom.  Finally about 5am, I lapsed into a nice, deep sleep.    Fast forward to 7am: "YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP" outside my bedroom window. ARGH!  Okay, this wouldn't be so bad, but the bitch owner did NOTHING to shut up this yipping piece of shit!  ARGH!  Not to mention the fact that I live on the 3rd floor of a NO PETS apartment complex.  But she has "medical issues" that allow her to have this bag of bones in the apartment complex.  Now, granted, I have two of my cats here... but they've never woken anyone up by barking at 7am.  GRRR!  I roll over, put my pillow over my head, and attempt to smother myself into unconsciousness.    Fast forward to 9am: "YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP!" ARRRGGGGHHH!!!  Yep, same stupid dog, same stupid owner.  DSO was in the shower, otherwise I might have sent his butt down to kick this dogs head in.  Or the owners.  But I'm thinking for a house warming gift to myself (we've been here 5 months), I'm going to invest in a BB Gun... or a muzzle.  One for the dog, one for the owner, and I'm not telling which is which!  GRRR!  And no nap in my future, since I get to go slave away at my cruddy job for 8 hours.  I'll fill in a "Cast of Players" post tomorrow.

      My most recent fascination: Blogs.  I have a few that I read daily, and that I've been reading for quite some time.  So, after reading these blogs for well over a month, I thought "Why not?" and did a search.  Tada!  Here we are.  So, we'll see if I can't continue this and keep it up to date, or if I'll lose interest in it like I do in everything else.  I have an old webpage out there also... and half done scrapbooking pages, a partially finished cross stitch... etc etc.  You get the point.  So Cheers!  Wish me luck...

      I am a closet blogger.  SKSO is not aware of this yet.  He laughs at me for reading all the blogs that I have bookmarked.  Yesterday, I was commenting about how I had been working on my webpage, which I hadn't touched in 1.5 yrs.  He goes "Next thing you know, you are going to have a blog."  I just kind of chuckled.    What's the harm, really?  No one reads this, so it's like having a journal, except faster, since I type a lot better than I write.   urlLink     When I start obsessing about my entries, using my cell phone to make text entries from work or something, that is when I will confess to him.  Until then, I'm content in my obscurity.

      My youngest (for now) just came up, gave me a nice big hug, patted my belly and goes "My mommy".    Yeah, that's why I had them.  Damn I love my kids.

      Wow, I was just perusing the mug shots at  urlLink The Smoking Gun and came across this  urlLink little gem.   Now that scares me, being the mother of two boys.  EEK!!!

      I love the 4th of July.  And there is a lot of comfort in tradition and continuity.  And this is a good thing I think.  Yesterday was the typical 4th of July celebration here on our lil island in the Pacific Northwest.  After getting off of work *bleh*, I loaded SKSO and the SKB's into the car and we headed down to the beach where the carnival ALWAYS sets up, and where the city's fireworks show is launched from.  Had to park way the fuck out in BFE, but I'm okay with that... I guess.  My fault for not asking for the day off earlier, but hey, it's time and a half.  Heh.  Anyways, the carnival was CROWDED!  OMG, afraid-I'm-going-to-lose-one-of-the-boys crowded!  *sniff*  My lil town I grew up in is growing so quickly!  We walked thru, trying to find the spot my parents staked out on the waterfront to watch from.  *side note: Living in the town you grew up in, went to school in, and are BACK living in is kinda bizarre.  To pass all these faces that you know, and in my case probably disliked, and to see the look of recognition in their eyes before they quickly avert them so they aren't sucked into a conversation with someone they don't want to be.  As if "I" would have stopped to chat.  Yeah, right.*    But it just filled me with warm fuzzies to note the continuity of this ritual.  Going to the carnival, spending $20 for the boys to play one game and win a prize that I wouldn't spend $3.50 on in the store, watching the lines of people wanting to get onto the "Ring of Fire" or "Gravitron" just one more time before having to go sit and watch the fireworks.  It's comforting.  After pissing away numerous dollars on games and rides, it was time for the run to the Funnel Cake stand.  FUCK!  Every year I get suckered into standing in the mile long line to get these too.  As if standing on my feet for 8 hours while pregnant wasn't torture enough... oh no.  We'll make the sore pregnant lady stand in line for the funnel cakes too.  Good thing I love my family.  Mostly.    So I head to the Funnel Cake place, and get in the line, like the good person I am.  It's set up like tent city on the beach.  All these different colored plastic tarp-looking stands selling all this yummy food.  So maybe I drooled a bit.  Funnel Cakes, BBQ Beef that was just falling apart, Lumpia from the Fil-Am folks, freshly made right there Kettle Corn, and the list goes on.  By far, my FAVORITE part of the carnival.  Hehe.    After a 20 min wait, I finally pick up our SIX, yes, 6, funnel cakes and maneuver my way back to the blanket on the beach to wait for the show.  You would think people would be a little more considerate of a pregnant woman waddling threw the masses with a stack of six funnel cakes.  Nope.  They probably all figured I was going to sit in a corner and eat all of them myself!    Anyways, we gorged ourselves on our tasty treats, and had a great old time.  We even got the priviledge of a drunk narration on the pretty colors of the different fireworks.  "GREEEEEN!!!  REEEEDDDD!!!  OOOOOH PURRRPPPLE!!!"  SK2 isn't usually fond of fireworks, and this year wasn't any different.  They had these ones that like shot out of the ground, and he informed us that they looked like a dragon breathing fire out of the ground and that it was coming to get him.  I don't think SK3 liked the fireworks either.  She was just a kicking away in my belly.  Guess I should be thankful she missed the bladder while slam-dancing.  No going to the porta-potties for me this year!  YAY!!!  Okay, so the day was kinda boring...  But it's tradition, so it's a good kind of boring.

      I woke up this morning, and was instantly depressed.  What should be a fun day, as the four of us are going to a concert, is shaping up to be blah.  Why?  It's July already.  Most would think that's a good thing, but not me.  Being July means that I only have another 3 weeks until I have to load my babies onto an airplane for a 2000 mile flight across the states to TN and the ex-moron.  That's not so bad, except he doesn't know how to deal with them.  He's never had to.  I've always been mom and dad for the most part.  But in TN also is the ex-moron's psychotic bitch of a mother.  OY!!!  I would rather cut off my toes than have my children subjected to this psycho!  There is a LOT of background there as far as why I feel this way, but trust me.  The bitch is crazy.  She needs to get mental help, ASAP!  She was on Prozac and felt she didn't need it anymore, so she quit taking it.  Umm, no.    So, I woke up, and realized it was July.  What did I do?  What any self-respecting yet overly hormonal woman would do... cried.  *rolling my eyes*  And I am so not an emotional person.  I blame SK3 totally for this!  The lil evil one who plays with my intestines like it's a pinata.  I keep trying to convince SKSO to let me hire a hitman.  He says it's too expensive.  I say the therapy I'm going to need one day will be more expensive than a one time payment to a hitman.    And then, what should I roll across today but this entry from  urlLink ASB  about her hubby.  Hmm, maybe it's divine intervention.  Or maybe my homicidal tendencies are making it seem that way...
