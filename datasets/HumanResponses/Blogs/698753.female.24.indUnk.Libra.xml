       The corporate mindset   I discovered yesterday that I have the power!!  The power to do good or evil!  I have...(da da dum...)...the keys to the supply cabinet.  *oooohhhh!!!!*  I have unlimited pens, paper, sticky notes, paperclips, scissors!!  EVERYTHING!!  I see why the temptation to steal office supplies is so high.  :)  It's a "because it's there" moment...  So far, I have stolen no office supplies...but the temptation is mounting.  :)  Psssst...anyone wanna buy a cheap stapler?  ;)

       Note to self...  ...kick PT's butt.  He made me think I didn't mention I was home.  Oh, and I weighed 163.5 this morning.  I blame C/M for letting me near Boston Pizza last night.

       ...aaaaand, I'm home.  :)  Well, I got home Sunday night.  Gave Meesh her keys back today and went out for a coffee and lasagne at Gallagher's coffee bar on Austin in Coquitlam.  Played Ultimate last night, as usual.  Went over to C/M's house afterwards, then went out to Boston Pizza...our default "late night" dining establishment.  I ate more yesterday than I did in the last three days...combination of heat and diet.  Felt good though.  Had another day of wonderful filing.  I actually kind of like my job.  Gives me time to think up naughty stories.  ;)  Ah well.  I fell asleep today at lunch in the break room.  :)  I didn't get much sleep over the weekend (cats...) or last night, seeing as I have to get up at 0730 or so to get downtown.  Hmph.  I hate getting up early, although Cat has seen me first thing in the morning after I've had some time to wake up, and I'm apparently annoyingly cheerful way too early.  Another thing I like about my job is that I don't need to be there at a specific time.  Between 8 and 9 is fine...which means I don't wait until the last minute to leave, which means I'm there on time or early...which means I get to go home early.  I love it!  I hate waiting around for stuff.  I prefer arriving exactly on time, which means that (with my incredibly underdeveloped sense of direction) I'm often late.  No worries about that here!  I just hung up my karate-gi (uniform) and my Ultimate gear is in the wash now.  Part of karate is making sure the gi is pressed, spotless and glaringly white for every class.  Argh...I don't like that bit, but I will not make the black belts do pushups for my mistakes.  They're supposed to make sure everyone's gi is properly done, so they get pushups for the lower belt's errors.  It's a pretty interesting system.  I wonder if I'd press the gi etc. if it was me who was having to do the pushups.  Don't know.  I'd like to think that I was honourable and respectful enough that punishment wouldn't enter into it.  Faugh...it's hot.  I'm rambling.  G'nite, unless I think of something else.

       Happy dance...  Ok,  urlLink this  may be a load of bull hooey, but according to it, I only need to lose one more pound in order to be at a healthy weight for my height.  I KNOW that this is inaccurate, but dammit...it's giving me a bit of encouragement.  And I'm not really 5'9", according to my tape measuring of the official "Oasis height wall" in the kitchen.  :(  I'm only barely 5'8"...maybe Candyman really is as tall as I am.  Don't tell him I said that.

       Ooh, the ideas I can use...   42.4% pure, according to Bimkin's spiffy  urlLink purity test .  I hadn't done a purity test in ages, so I decided to try it.  Y'know, if I used drugs, my score would be soooo much lower.  Too bad.  However, I have some new ideas.  Sex in a hammock or a tree...honestly.  I'd never thought of that.

       Home again  I'm messing with some of the stuff on my sidebar, so it may look funny.  Meh.  Not really caring right now.  I'm starting working full time tomorrow for two weeks.  *sigh*  I look forward to the money, but I don't want to work.  Hm.  A job that makes me lots of money, but I don't have to do any work... I should get into management.  :)  Didn't exercise today, had way too much money on my credit card (parent's anniversary present, bike rack [which I think I will be returning] among other things.)  However, I'm still at 162 lbs.  Didn't do any cleaning today.  :p  This weekend was pretty slow, except for karate.  I submitted my hours for the church today, so I ought to have some money next week.  Candyman went to look at a bunch of science fiction and fantasy books, but I wasn't invited.  :(  Probably just as well.  I think I have over 2000 books at my house already.  Played  urlLink Illuminati  over at Candyman's house with a couple of friends last night.  It was pretty fun.  I almost won...going for an all or nothing gamble, weakening everyone else, but then got stopped.  Fun, fun.  :)  Kind of like the  Undergrads  episode where they play Risk...  Gimpy: (screaming)  KAMIKAZE!! KAMIKAZE!!!  Yeah, that was me last night.  :)

       Haaaaaaaa-choo!  Whew.  Daisy's playing with an empty can and a plastic bag, so I don't have to deal with her jumping all over me.  She's right beside me though, so I can keep an eye on her.  I'm housesitting thisweekend...Candyman's ex girlfriend's place.  She and her fiance have two cats down in the basement and her mom has three cats upstairs.  I'm allergic to cats.  No good can come of this.  :p  Daisy's really cute though.  She's just a little thing: about 7 months old, with all the kitten-y qualities.  I want a cat that stays small, and cute and kitten-y for their whole lives.  Oh wait, that's a ferret.  :)   I want one of those too.  Thinking about my last post (Hot for teacher.) I should probably clarify what I meant by a "safe" crush.  I actually wasn't being facetious or anything.  I think this is a very safe crush, and I really am kind of happy about it.  By safe, I mean that he is: 1) not a good friend of mine 2) not a good friend of Candyman 3) in a position of power, sort of, so he won't do anything even if he's interested because he'll be afraid of getting slapped with a sexual harrassment suit. 4) not a co-worker, so I only have to see him once a week.  Ok, that's just adorable...Daisy's sticking her paw into a cup of water and splashing me, then sticking her nose into it, drinking and sneezing.  (I took away the plastic bag because she's torn a bit of a hole in it and I don't want her to choke.)  I'm so getting a cat when I move out.  A permanent kitten would be awesome.  hhhhaaaaaaaa-choo!!  Or not...  *splish*  Well...ok.  *sprrrraawwwwwlll right across my lap, attack the keyboard holder from underneath, and fall off my lap, then go to stalk one of the other cats...*  Priceless.  :)   *scrolls back up*  God and Goddess.  I need something harder hitting than "then the kitten did cute stuff".  Meh.  I'm sure it'll get back to normal later.  So, I got my weight down to 162 lbs today.  :D  (Daisy's knocking that can all around and not playing with the mouse!!  Yay!!  ahem.  Sorry...)  Went to karate, and learned some neat things.  (kitten alert: underneath a pile of papers...WTF? How did she get under there?!)  Slept after I got home.   Ahhhhh, screw it.  I can't deal with this when there's a cat around.  I'm glad I'm in the basement though...  I'm sorry Bimkins, but you CAN'T get this cute without being a kitten yourself...  *splish, there's droplets on the screen, and off she goes with a ball of paper in her mouth to play with.*  *Riiiiiiiiips*  Crap.

       Hot for teacher.  I think I have a crush on one of my karate sensei (teacher).  Cool.  That's something I could use right now.  A nice, simple, unreturnable crush.  Excellent.

       Can't we just cuddle?   An open letter to the cats I'm housesitting for/with  Dear Mojo and Jag, Let's get one thing clear right away.  I like you.  I really do.  I just don't think that our relationship can continue in this manner.  I think that we should talk about the direction that our relationship is going.  1) We seem to have differing opinions about what constitutes affection, for one thing.  Myself, I consider it to be showing affection when I pet you, and let you cuddle with me in bed.  You, especially Mojo I think (it was dark sometimes when this happened), seem to like biting my hand when I pet you, and then get all hurt when I stop petting you.  That's really not fair to me, getting these mixed signals.  2) Also, while I kind of like the feel of you licking my fingers, I'm really not a fan of it happening while I'm sleeping.  Especially when it's my nose.  In fact, while we're on the topic, getting a cold nose in my face while I'm sleeping isn't really my cup of tea either.  3) Next...you guys are HEAVY!  So, please, when I have a stomach ache (yes, I KNOW I shouldn't have had potato skins and mocha milkshakes at 2am...) don't jump onto my stomach.  You really are uncomfortable.  Also, when I finally drop off to sleep, licking my shoulder isn't really condusive to me staying asleep and being in what you would call a "good" mood the next day.  4) Now, I know that you like me, and I was very grateful that you keep your claws in whenever you bat at my arms or my face, however, please keep the face-batting to a minimum when you've just used the litter-box.  I *know* I didn't hear the water running after you went to the bathroom, so don't try to fool me into thinking you washed your hands.  What?  You lick your paws to clean them?  Well, please see #2 again.  So guys, we're going to be together for another 24 hours or so.  If you have any problems with me, please write them down and let me know, mmmm-kay?  I'd really like to make this work.  Thanks.  Love and kisses, Oasis  PS.  Please don't sleep on my clothes.  I didn't bring any spares for today, and I'm allergic to cats and forgot my anti-histamines.  Also, you've got an entire king-sized bed to lie on.  *****   And that is why I'm home and awake at 10 am on the last Saturday before I work full time for two weeks.

       Sex joke time...   1)  What kind of chocolate do you use for kinky sex?  (from Bimkins) 2)  Why is sex like air?  (from  urlLink red headed slut ) 3)  What's the difference between erotic and kinky?  (from Bimkins)  (answers after the terribly punny [sorry!!] joke coming up.)  Computer Dates (from  urlLink here ) I was hanging out in a SCSI bar. A loud bandwidth played in the corner.  I gave the place a binary search. I saw a little chip in the corner. She SIMMed like a pro. I traversed over to her.  She pressed her Apples against me. "Hey, Mac, do you have a hard drive?" "No, only a floppy," I replied.  "Well, then you need an Amiga," she sed.  "Vi?"  "Well, if I was your Amiga, we could interface."  We went to a motel on a VESA local bus.  The motel was SCSI-2. It needed to be debugged.  "So, how much is this going to cost me?" I queried.  She added it up right away. She had a mind like a...like a.... She could add really fast.  She stripped her binaries. It was quite a procedure.  "I'm going to turn your software into hardware," she transmitted.  She started to spreadsheet.  "So, are you ready to RAM?" she called.  I had been auditing everything. I sent a signal. It was time for the trap.  All the agents burst through the gateway. My manager was with them.  "Awk! It's a RAID!" she sed.  "Don't arrest me! I'm a motherboard! How will I explain this to my Sun?"  The agents were not responding. They got ready to stop her process.  She was getting desperate. "Hey, I could do a favor for all of you. I'm fully multitasking."  It didn't work. We're all UNIX.   1)  S & M & M's 2)  Because it's not a big deal until you aren't getting any. 3)  Erotic: You use a feather, Kinky: You use the whole chicken.

       They're safe.  Stupid little boogers just stopped at every fast food place on the way to Seattle that they could.  And they didn't buy me Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  Booger.

       APB-going south along I5, Explorer with three teenage boys  My brother and his two friends are currently MIA on their way down to Seattle for the Enumclaw Highland Games.  They left 8 hours ago, then got pulled over for missing a single lugnut on their car.  It got towed and they were left at the side of the freeway.  They made it back to our house, then left again, using a different car.  This was about six hours ago.  They should have made it to Seattle by now and met up with my dad, who has been phoning us every half hour for the last two hours.  My mother is starting to get very worried.

       Friday Five  Yeah, I'm a copycat.  So sue me.  :)  I've actually thought a little about this subject, but it was in the guise of a book.  So here goes.  This is going to be a long one...with a lot of links.  I'll probably never do it this in depth ever again, so enjoy!   1. If your life were a movie, what would the title be?  "Forcing Away"  (Ultimate Frisbee reference)   2. What songs would be on the soundtrack?  *looks up the playlist of the CD that I just burned...*    urlLink "1000 Oceans" - Tori Amos   [I found this song after Pete Abrams from  urlLink Sluggy Freelance  used it in his "Fire and Rain" storyline]    urlLink "Desert Rose" -	Sting   [The first few times I heard this song was when it was a warm June/July/September? night last year and I was in a really spacy mood, just driving around with Candyman, and he had the sunroof in his car open.  It always brings me back there.]    urlLink "Everybody Knows" -	Leonard Cohen   [I was on the verge of breaking up with Candyman once, right near the beginning of our relationship, when he played this song for me.  I'd never heard it before, and figured that if someone likes this odd music, with these amazing lyrics, then there's something in there worth fighting for.]    urlLink "Faith of the Heart" -	Russell Watson   [I love the visuals of the opening scene for "Enterprise", and the music fits it so well.  It gives me hope that humanity might make it into the Star Trek world of acceptance and peace.  I only have the short version...hmmm....I might have to buy a CD soon.]    urlLink "Fire and Rain" -	Dave Matthews Band (cover)   [Another song from Sluggy Freelance's "Fire and Rain" storyline.  Found  urlLink this  site while looking up lyrics.]    urlLink "It's Not Easy To Be Me" -	Five For Fighting   [I'm a fan of superheroes, and it really isn't easy being anyone...including Superman.  I thought this was Dave Matthews for the longest time.  Huh.  Go figure.  And I've never seen Smallville either.]    urlLink "Cape" -	Guy Clark   [A song that partly inspired me to start this blog.]    urlLink "Heaven Denied" -	Labÿrinth   [A very spacy song, it also partly inspired me to start this blog.]    urlLink "99 Red Balloons" (English) -	Nena   [It's just so true...]   "Diva Opera Mix" (5th Element) -	Sarah Brightman  [Memories of a great movie...one of the first things Candyman played for me on his kickass entertainment system.  Couldn't find the lyrics...]    urlLink "Back On Earth" - Ozzy Osbourne   [My brother introduced me to this song.  I'd never heard any Ozzy before.  Not a fan of his voice, but the lyrics are stupendous.]    urlLink "500 Miles"	- Proclaimers   [I've always wanted someone who would walk 1000 miles for me, if it ever became necessary.  I guess I'm a silly girl.]    urlLink "Jukebox Hero" -	Foreigner   [Another song that made me decide to start this blog.  I took the name of this blog from some of the lines.]    urlLink "Callin' Baton Rouge"	- Garth Brooks   [Another song that shows I'm a silly girl.  I want someone to love me enough to call me every hour that they're away from me...and I want to love them enough to not get irritated by it.  :)]    urlLink "Didn't Start the Fire" -	Billy Joel   [Realizing that all of these things happened in less than 100 years gives me hope that I might be able to change the world, in at least a little way.]    urlLink "Forever Young" ("Queer as Folk" Techno Remix)	- Temperance   [Vampire song.  :)  Someday I'll post all my vampire songs. Lyrics partway down the page.]    urlLink "It's The End of the World As We Know It" -	REM   [It's true...just like Nena's "99 Red Balloons"]    urlLink "Lady Picture Show" -	Stone Temple Pilots   [Yet another Sluggy Freelance reference.]    urlLink "Phantom of the Opera" (Techno Dance Mix)	- ???   [Another Gothic reference I guess.  I love any movie/story/song that implies supernatural love that trancends boundaries.  Some of the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" songs from the musical episode do that.  That's the only episode I've watched all the way through, FYI...]    3. Would it be a live-action film or animated? Why?  Live action.  If it were animated, it would  have  to be anime though.  I prefer that style to "traditional" animation.  I think that live action would make it sexier...   4. Casting: who would play you, members of your family, friends, etc?   Huh.  These are kind of based on appearance I guess, but some of it has to do with previous roles...or something.  I don't know!!!  Me:  urlLink Carrie-Anne Moss  [I'd love it to be Nicole Kidman, but can't justify it.  At least Carrie-Anne and I both wear black PVC...  ;)  And we're both from Vancouver.  Although, I do have a corset...]  Candyman:  urlLink Oded Fehr  [If Candyman read this, he'd probably be all embarrassed, but I think there's a definite resemblance.  Good thing he doesn't read this...]  Justy:  urlLink  Elijah Woods   [This is mostly because of the Frodo character.  I don't know why...he just sort of jumped out at me.  Please don't kill me!]  Bimkins:  urlLink Orlando Bloom  [mostly so that Bimkins could meet him.  ;) ]  Kittens:  urlLink Renee Zellweger   [Bit of a resemblence.  :)  And (she's gonna kill me for this...) I could totally see her acting a bit like Bridget in "Bridget Jones's Diary"  *ducks*]  Cat: Crap.  I have no idea...probably some sexy indie, undiscovered star.  Or  urlLink Christina Ricci ...fsck.  Yeah, this one didn't jump out at me at all...    5. Describe the movie preview/trailer.  Um.  Well, probably it would open with me playing Ultimate Frisbee, then going back and forth between that and me wearing my clubbing clothes (black PVC, corsets etc.) and doing karate, interspersed with nine-ball, and tasteful love scenes.  Oh, and me teaching Sunday school.  LOL.  And me fighting with Candyman, and being morose.  Maybe I should have Christina Ricci playing me instead.  Cat, wanna switch?  The whole thing would be a study in contrasts.  This was actually posted at 2:53 pm.  I was saving it as I was going, and so it saved at 1:00 or whatever.

       So sleepy...  I couldn't sleep last night.  I am grumpy and overly warm and feeling totally apathetic about doing stuff today.  I should probably put my new bike rack together and go for a bike ride (test out the tire on an extended trip) around Rocky Point Park.  But I'm feeling lazy...  Good Oasis:  But you should go and exercise in the beautiful weather!!  Bad Oasis:  Bah, beat the heat by drinking your 1.5 litre bottle of strawberry wine in the fridge.  Good O:  You should work on losing some more weight!  You're already at 164!  Have some vegetables and chicken, then go for a bike ride.  It will make you less grumpy as well.  Bad O:  No, invite Justy up to play nineball and eat chips, Taquitos (from 7-11) and slurpies!  You'll feel much better about yourself.  Real Oasis:  /me starts chasing the crazy fairies around with a phone book and electric fly-swatter.

       Halfway there  Turns out my bike didn't have a leak (or else it's a REALLY slow leak.) and the bike rack I got for free wasn't compatible with my car.  So I bought a $100 3 bike rack, and a water bottle carrier.  Now I need to use them.  It's like exercise tapes...gotta use them to get the benefits.  I did the tie dye money stuff.  I don't want to put away clothes, dammit.  Or box up my winter clothes.  Maybe tomorrow?  Bah.  I think my next goals will be "No more goals" and "go to bed before 12".  Yeah.  Time for that.  Night.

       Needing to blog.  I don't really have too much to say today.  Played Ultimate yesterday...managed to not hurt myself for the 5th(?) week in a row!  Oh, I guess I could do my goal thing.   Online:  Still blogging.  Financial:  Credit card bill was lower than I thought.  Should be able to pay it all off, including what I owe Candyman and the parents for this month and next.  Physical I:  164.5 lbs today and yesterday.  That's down half a pound in case anyone's been paying attention.  Physical II:   Ultimate Frisbee yesterday.  What today?  Only time will tell.  Personal Space:   Ugh.  I lost about 10 sq feet when my dad put a bunch of stuff back into my room.  I haven't been able to deal with it.  However, I did conglomerate two big piles of clean clothes, so there's another 5 feet of space.  345/400 is unliveable right now.  Education:  Reading "Power Herbs".  I'm registered for 3 courses in the fall at SFU, so that's going to be my focus come September.   Other goals:   I still haven't done the tie dye money stuff.  :(  I've been holding to my other goals pretty well though...picked up my karate uniform yesterday.  So, what are my goals for today?    1) Do the tie dye money stuff!! 2) Go to Cap's Bicycles and see about getting a bike rack put on my car and get my bike's tire changed (slow leak  :p ) 3) Put away clean laundry on floor.  4) Get rid of winter clothing (box?)  Just remembered...a couple days ago I decided that July 22nd was going to be National No Pants Day...well, I never got around to getting changed, so I decided that I don't follow those silly, made up National Days.  Yeah, even when I make them up.

       Musings.  My parents have just celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary.  I simply cannot see myself together with one person for 25 years.  Something to do with my longest relationship being just over three years, I guess.  Candyman and I have been together now for nearly a year officially, and 14 months unofficially, and it still feels like we haven't been together that long.  It's sort of weird that way.  I don't know...maybe because we don't really talk about our future or anything much...we just sort of let it happen.  [edit: took some stuff off here that was too personal about someone else.]

       Creation of a new day.  There are "National Day of Blah" popping up all over the place, so I think I'm adding one.  Today is "National 'It's too damn hot to wear pants' Day".  I'm going downstairs to participate.

       A small step for a woman...   I sucessfully completed all the goals I set for myself two nights ago.  It may not look like much to the outsider, but I feel that goal completing is like a muscle.  It must be exercised slowly in order to strengthen it, otherwise you wind up pulling something.   Heh.  So now, goals for today...  1)  Buy my parent's 25th wedding anniversary present.  [edit: 4:08 pm.  Bought a really nice silver and glass clock.  My brother and I are splitting the cost of it.] 2) Figure out tie dye money stuff (we did tie dyed shirts for Ultimate Frisbee jerseys last week, and I organized the tie dye, so I need to collect money from everyone.) 3) Do karate practice (~10 minutes) 4) Bring up laundry and do a load (gotta wash the Ulti-gear)   I feel great about completing these goals.  No specific goals for yesterday, but I ate pretty healthy yesterday, played Ultimate really hard, worked a full day filing papers and didn't mess up my room too much.  I even practiced seiza while filing papers. (right foot out, left knee SLOWLY down making sure there's only a fist width between feet, wince at sore right thigh muscle, right foot back, sit back on feet with toes down, shift forward, point toes, knees two fist widths apart, open drawer, file papers, reverse process  to get up.)

       I have goals for tonight!  Ok, I'm very tired from dealing with the brats from hell Sunday School class, I didn't get as much sleep as I should have last night, and I didn't get my nap today.  HOWEVER!  Before I go to bed tonight I will accomplish several things.  1)  I will clean off my couch (Personal space goal=10 square feet) 2)  I will practice what I learned at karate for at least 10 minutes (hand block, punch, movement and [ugh] getting into and out of seiza) 3)  I will pack a very healthy lunch and several snacks for work tomorrow. 4)  I will get clothing ready for tomorrow so that I don't have to do the mad scramble at 7 am.  Thank you.  Should I be ambitious and post my goals for tomorrow?  BECAUSE I WILL GET THESE ONES DONE!!!  I think I'll wait.    (And the amazing Fudgesicle brand is...Fudgesicle: The Original Brand.  Seriously.)

       It's so EASY!!  Damn, it's almost too easy to post now.  It's like "Ok, I have ten seconds...I can write something."  I don't think I'll be going back to doing all my own coding, thank you very much.  I need to put comments on this blog.  Yup yup.  That's my next project...as soon as I get other stuff together.  (the lava lamp's still at the garage sale.  I wonder if it's been price reduced yet...I'd better go have another fudgecicle, which I forgot to check the brand again...)

       Ow, my freaking legs!   This post is very run-on and fragmented...I'm still tired.   Yes, friends.  Practicing seiza (kneeling down in five easy steps, then getting back up in five easy steps) makes the top of the right thigh muscle very tired and sore.  I guess that means I'm doing it right...  Unfortunately, my posture hasn't improved much, but at least I'm aware of the fact that it's crummy.  We have hummingbirds at my house again.  They left for a couple of weeks, but they're back, feeding on the specifically chosen flowers that my mom and I bought for them, and drinking the specially formulated nectar.  They're eating better than I am these days!  Speaking of eating (woo, segue...) I love fat free, sugar free fudgecicles.  Bimkins, I'm trying to remember what brand they are, but I'm lazy and stairs are evil, so I'm not going to go and look right now.  HA!  I think one of the neat things about karate (at least in the one time that I've gone...) is that it's making me want to be a better person.  Huh.  I started taking karate in order to become more fit, but it seems to be helping me want to achieve my other goals.  Justy has mentioned something about that in regards to kendo (Japanese "whacking people with sticks").  Hmm...I feel like doing yoga...first must eat, then bug Justy into showing me yoga stuff again, or I could do the yoga DVD that I bought at Costco.  Unfortuanately, it doesn't count towards fitness just owning exercise DVD's and tapes.  You gotta use 'em.  Walked up my hill today to check out a garage sale.  A few nice things, but very expensive...I resisted the urge to spend $20 on a purple lava lamp though...I'm quite proud of myself.  We'll see if I can continue to resist through the day.  Fudgecicles...cure the shopping craving, by indulging the chocolate craving.

       Ooh, good movie!!  Went to see  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  this evening with Candyman.  It was a very good movie.  I won't give away any spoilers, but at one point I was very disappointed because the movie seemed...simple.  It seemed like they could have done much more than they did.  And then they did.  :D     And there's a vampire.  I like vampires.  I have a minor vampire fetish...which as many people will attest, is more like a major vampire fetish obsession.  Heh.  Well...you say "tomato", I say "vegetable that is just advertising for trouble with it's succulent blood red colour".  Re-reading that paragraph...just seemed...odd.  Um.  Ok, endorphins apparently making me crazy.  Oh, I was so very good tonight.  I didn't have any junk food at the theatre, nor did I drink my usual "blue raspberry of death" slurpee type thing.  I stuck to ice water and feel very good about myself.  My legs are still very tired from karate, and I have to get up and teach tomorrow morning, so I think I'll call it a night.  Oh right...running total.  Maybe I should just write it up once a week...   Online:  blogged many times so far.  Financial:  Um, I haven't opened my credit card bill yet.  I'm kind of scared, and I need to buy a gi for karate...  Physical I:  165 lbs, baybeee!  No junk food today either.  Physical II:  Went to karate tonight.  Loving it.  Personal Space:  Roughly 350 square feet out of 400 are totally unlivable.  The 50 feet equals my bed, some space beside it, my bathroom and a path to each place.  Education:  Currently reading "Power Herbs", and referencing other herbal and aromatherapy books.  Tonight I will be researching blisters and how to cure them before my Monday night Ultimate Frisbee game.

       Ohhhhh...that felt good...  I had my first karate class tonight in a long time.  My ankle felt great, my legs are now sore in that "I just worked out, and damn do I feel great" kind of way.  I bought a new Tensor type bandage...it's Velcro-riffic!!  Now, I'm over at Candyman's writing a quick blog, and trying to decide if I want to stay here and watch TV and play nine-ball, or go out to see a movie.  Decisions.  :)  Justy-san...I'd love it if I could borrow some of the coding from your webpage.  Could we work something out?  I'm at 165 lbs today after karate class!  w00t!  3y3 4m w0rk1n6 0n m4 604lz!  Happy dance!  Now if only I could get some cleaning in tonight.

       Hey, it's coming together...  Small things amuse small minds...or at least make them seem better.  I left my sunglasses/glasses at Candyman's last night and he sent me a voice mail, then backed it up with an email which said "I love you" in it.  For some reason we haven't been super affectionate lately, with "I love you"s being in somewhat short supply on both ends.  It's just nice to see it again, especially since I was up lying in bed being neurotic last night about relationships and stuff...  :p  Sometimes my mind just goes around in circles, annoyingly.  If it was going around in circles about something that I could change right then, or even change a little later, it wouldn't be annoying.  Well, not as annoying.

       No longer blinded by the stars in my eyes.   Well, here's a test.  I've done some blogs before, but for various reasons they've gotten toasted.  I'm separating this blog from my other ones, so if you're here, you probably got here either directly from me, or linked from a friend...not that anyone has this yet.  Um, yeah.  I tend to get these urges to blog at strange times...this time it was after being at my b/f, Candyman's, house.  I was driving home and listening to my brand new mix CD when I started getting really depressed listening to Foreigner's "Juke Box Hero" and some of the Labyrinth soundtrack.  I realized that goddammit, my dreams aren't going to come true on their own.  If I have something that I want to happen, then I need to be the one to make it work.  It sounds kind of silly, especially since I've read it a bunch of times and heard it from various people, but for the first time, it sort of hit me...I'm in charge of my own destiny.  If I don't like how my life is going, I need to be the one to haul ass into what I want.  It's still kind of depressing to realize that I'm not going to be a popular cheerleader in high school (yeah, I know...I'm 23...) or that my modelling contract just isn't going to show up.  80% of the Vancouver Canucks are younger than me!!  I'm starting a mid-life crisis in my early 20's...this can't be good.  On the bright side, I found a couple silver hairs the other night, and I thought that kicked serious ass.  I love them...they kind of gleam in the light.  It's pretty nifty.  I'm tempted to try dying my hair silver...or streaking it or something.  Get a "Rogue" look from X-Men or something.  So, I'm going to start blogging my goals and give a running total of how they're going.  Maybe I'll actually be able to keep this blog going at the same time.  OK, so some goals...   Online:  blog once a week or more (I'm starting slow...)  Financial:   pay off my debts.  I owe Candyman $1,700, plus I owe my parents $11,500 for my snazzy new car.  Right now I work temporary part time filing papers at an accounting office near Granville Island and do some background performing (AKA "extras" work) for TV and film. Not a lot of money in either.  Physical I:  Get my weight to 150 lbs.  I'm at 165ish right now, but I feel like I should lose some weight.  I'm 5'9" if anyone cares.  Physical II:  Exercise every day.  So far, I play Ultimate Frisbee on Candyman's teams twice a week, and I've either gone for a jog (yuck) or a mini hike (both about 20 minutes) twice this week.  I'm going to be starting karate on Saturdays, and trying to get to the gym.  I didn't exercise tonight.  Personal Space:  My room (I still live with my parents) is an absolute disaster area.  I need to de-clutter the entire place.  It's about 500 square feet that I can't live in, and a path leading from the door to my closet, bed and bathroom.  Education:  I have my Bachelor's in English Lit, but I can't do much with that.  I'll be taking some classes in the fall, but I also study on my own, especially herbal medicine, aromatherapy and various religions.  I guess that's about it for tonight.  Thanks for listening.

       Hurrah!  I got paid today!  I can give Justy money for the tank!  And there was mac and cheese next door!  I spent 18 bucks on chinese food when I could've spent $5.50 on mac 'n' cheese.  Grrrr...  Oh well, it was probably left over from yesterday anyway.  :p

       Downs and ups and downs again.  This afternoon I was in a growly, pissy, "I hate everyone and if you come near me I'm going to kill you with a paper clip" kind of mood.  Then I had lunch, and now I'm just in a really really bad "I hate pretty much everyone and everything" mood.  I don't hate birds though.  There were some really cute LBB's (Little Brown Birds) on the way back from the semi-ok, expensive Chinese food place.  That cheered me up.  However, the time slot for Candyman's team is in the one time slot I can't make.  ARGH!  I'll be looking for a new team.  :(

       Me, impatient?  Noooooo...  :)  Ultimate Frisbee schedules for fall league come out today...I wanna know when we're playing.  C'mon.  C'mon...  now now now now now now now.  Checked the email.  Nothing from Candyman.  Checked the  urlLink VUL website .  Nothing there that I could see.  Want to know!  On the other hand...I don't think I'm quite ready for summer to be over yet.  "Fall" league sounds just a little too close to "really frigging cold winter time" for me to be totally happy about it.  :p  I'm not a fan of winter.  However, there are occasional  urlLink benefits .  *pops over to another window for a moment*     urlLink First Canucks (exhibition) game is on September 18!!   Less than a month!!! Hell, less than three weeks.  ...   ...  HEY!! It's not getting broadcast!  Bastards...when's the first home game?  *checks*  Oh...that's it...the first one is the 18th, but it's getting played in Winterpeg Manisnowba.  *grabs the baseball bat*  Not happy...Gotta wait until the 25th at the earliest to see a game.  :(

       It's dat kinda day...  Fact 1)  After work I'm going home to a really good, free meal. Fact 2)  I'm really not all that hungry yet. Fact 3)  They have macaroni and cheese next door at the catering place. Fact 4)  I really, really, really want some macaroni and cheese. Fact 5)  I can't afford said macaroni and cheese because I have a new fish tank (HA! got another mention of my fish tank...I am such a geek...)  Conclusion)  While it is a mac and cheese kinda day, I will wait until I get home to have chicken and potato salad.  I'm boring today.  :p  Maybe I'll enthrall everyone later about the crim paper that I really don't want to try and start writing tonight but should.

       'd rather be napping.  But I can't.  I'm at work.  :p   So I'm blogging before my break ends.  I would just like to make a small request...ahem...  COULD IT PLEASE HURRY UP AND RAIN ALREADY?!?!?!  Thank you.  It was teasing a little on the way to work today, and it's a chilly, damp, cream of soup kind of day, but there hasn't been much rain at ALL.  *grumble*  Yeah, Ontario people...you had a couple days in the dark...whoopdy do...our Interior doesn't have much power either, and it's BURNING DOWN!  I need soup.  I think I will have my third hot chocolate of the day instead, because I don't have time to go to the store and pick up a Cup of Noodles.  I would like to make a note that  urlLink this lip balm  really is da bomb.  :)    I need to return my carbon to the fish store...apparently guppies don't need it, and apparently gravel isn't too good for them either.  Something about them eating food and resting on the bottom of tanks at night or something.  I don't know.  I think I will go back to Big Al's and get a small nursery tank, but not right away.  We'll see if my fish can even get themselves knocked up or not.  Thursday is the day.  Thursday I will do some corporate whoring, and apply to a bunch of big companies to see if I can get a full time job for September-ish.  Grrr...I don't like it, but I like money.  And if I'm going to be responsible for a bunch of little bratty guppies, I'm going to have to have money so I can move out so I can have space to so I can have more fish tanks.  Ooh...a fish room...I would loooooove that...it can double as my library.  :)

       Horoscope!   Brought to you by  urlLink 365gay.com    LIBRA September 23 - October 22  You're not in your best form.  you're off in a corner quietly sucking your thumb. Don't worry. You haven't become a complete spoilsport. It's just that this time of year tends to be a challenge for you. This is because the Sun is opposite your sign, kicking up those existentialist woes. Try staging your own production of Hamlet (since you already have "To be or not to be" thoroughly memorized.)

       A mishmash of stuff.  Yesterday the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra sent me the 2003/2004 programs.  I'll post more info for people who are interested in going soon.  My Oma is coming into town from Edmonton today for a week, so I might not be available to do stuff.  I might not be online much either, except at work (and usually as soon as I say that, I'm online like crazy...)  I've decided not to worry about weight this week since my mom tends to cook more Austrian (read: fattening..) food when Oma's in town, and she tends to cook at least one dinner as well.  I got my new fish tank.  :D  Justy came over yesterday to help me set it up, but I still need the carbon, sponge and stuff for the filter.  It's a 33 gallon tank, and right now it contains three female guppies, two male guppies and three unsexed goldfish.  I'm pretty sure they're males though.  I think one, maybe two, of my females are pregnant.  :)  I'm gonna be an aunt!!  Or something.  My room was getting clean...but I had to move a bunch of crap to get the tank in, so there's stuff scattered all over the place again.  Hopefully an hour or so of de-cluttering will fix all that.  Grrr...frustration.  *peers into serene blue fishtank* Ahhh...

       Vit. C, echinachea and chicken noodle soup  Yes, the cold has exploded.  I woke up this morning feeling awful.  Ugh.  So yesterday was the Ultimate tourney.  We lost all four of our games, so we didn't have to play today.  (good thing especially for me...I don't think I would've gotten up...)  Went to the Ulti BBQ last night.  It was fun, especially kicking people's collective asses at Frickets (Frisbee Cricket...hard to explain, fun to play).  My partner and I won our first game, then we lost the second game, but we played a couple of fun games afterwards and all was good.  Justy came out to watch the last part of the last game, which was cool.  I've been after him to come watch for ages now.  I've decided to start going to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, but I need people to go with me because I have no motivation to do stuff a lot of the time.  :p  I'm thinking about going to five shows over the next couple months, and selling the other tickets to people who are interested in going.  So far I've got two people who want to come.  Anyone else?  Email at kinkygrrl1701@yahoo.com if you want to come to the VSO with me sometime.  Shows are about $20 or so.  I should clean out my car.  I should be cleaning my room.  I should be starting a paper on criminology for next semester.  But I probably won't because the phone just rang.

       Friday Five  Damn, Justy got his up before me...but he cheated.  Um...yeah.  It's TECHNICALLY Saturday...but only kind of...   1. When was the last time you laughed?  Tonight at the wedding when the bride and groom were doing a "hold up a shoe" game to figure out who knows each other better.  It was pretty funny; you had to be there.   2. Who was the last person you had an argument with?  "An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a definite proposition...an argument is an intellectual process... contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says."  By that logic, the last person I had an argument with was Candyman a couple of nights ago.  Getting mad at someone because I felt I was right and dammit they were wrong...um...Candyman again, two nights ago.  Just contradicting someone because I felt like it...Candyman again.  Everytime I talk to him.  :D   3. Who was the last person you emailed?  Guy I'm trying to buy a computer from for cheaper than he wants to sell it.   4. When was the last time you bathed?  Bath:  probably the middle of the fall season for Ultimate.  I was very sore and I don't have a tub in my room. Shower:  Yesterday night.   5. What was the last thing you ate?  Chocolate cake, lemon cake, kiwi fruit and pineapple at the wedding.

       Mawige...  I have decided I want to get married.  I don't know if I actually want to BE married...but the wedding would be fun.  :)  It was a nice wedding tonight.  I especially liked the centerpieces...I brought three of them home.  (Didn't steal them!  The bride gave them to me!!)  They were fishbowls, complete with tiny goldfish in each of them.  So I now I have six goldfish and three very attractive bowls to keep them in.  Happy!  I like fish.  I have been meaning to restock my aquarium.  My fish tend to go AWOL on me every so often, and I only have five for a 10 gallon, plus a fighting fish in another large bowl.  Time for a new mini tank!  I wonder if there's a sale on five gallon tanks anywhere...I wonder if I can fit it anywhere...top of my bookshelf?  Need to clean some candle stuff off first.  Project for Sunday night!!  Ultimate frisbee tournament tomorrow.  Four games in a row...  :/  Wish me luck.

I would like to say that there are some seriously arrogant putzes working here.  Honestly.  How difficult is it to put dishes into the dishwasher instead of the sink?  Especially when there's signs up all over the place requesting that you do this?  Whoa.  I'm channeling my mom.  :/  Going to a wedding tonight.  :)  Friend of mine that I don't see very often is getting married.  Should be fun, except for the fact that I have to get from Granville Island to Langley in Friday rush hour by 6:30.  Blah...

       One of those days  This is not going to be a good day.  I was lucky enough to experience a "time warp" kind of sleep last night...you know the one.  Where you swear you've been asleep for six or seven hours, only to look at the clock and realize that it's only been three minutes.  Gragh...  :(  So sleepy...I feel really lousy today too.  Dizzy, slightly nauseated.  Exhausted...of course.  And I've got five paper cuts already.  Bloody hell.  I think I'll be whining a lot today...  I was missing Ultimate yesterday, but dear God(ess[es])...I'm so glad it's not on tonight.  I cleaned my room a whole bunch last night.  New total= 280 square feet are unliveable.

I can deal with penis enlargement stuff and pr0n ads and retired, dispossessed generals who want to give me millions of dollars.  However.  I consider it to be the height of irritation to have music greet me when I open a website that I'm looking at.  To get really annoying synthed music piped at me when I open up a piece of spam?  That's going too far.  (and yes, I was pretty sure it was spam...I just wanted to double check.  One of those "just in case it really is interesting or important" moments.)  I get out of that screen.  Music continues.  I delete the message.  Music continues.  I go to a completely different site!  MUSIC CONTINUES!!!  Grrrr... not impressed at all.  I should not need to quit my browser in order to make the music stop.  [/rant]  My weight's gone back down to 162.5 from 166 or so last week.  :)

I have enough self esteem tonight to be egotistical.  Cool.  :)  I'm going to bed...I slept most of yesterday, then went to see S.W.A.T.  with Candyman.  I was in bed by midnight, and asleep by 1 or so...AND I'M STILL FRIGGING TIRED!  I blame the corporate world.  It really is a soul sucking demon.  :p

       Oh yeah...   Horoscope time...from  urlLink 365gay.com   LIBRA September 23 - October 22   The Moon is making you a little loony tunes. You're Jamie Lee Curtis in Freaky Friday, discovering that your soul has been transferred into her teenage daughter's body. (The horror of reliving those teen years! Can we say angst attack?) Or you're former NYPD Blue star Andrea Thompson making birthday phone calls for pay through the new Hollywoodiscalling.com service. (Why are you slumming it, Andrea? You're a graduate of the Actor's Studio, for God's sake!) Odd things may be happening, but try not to lose that natural poise.

       Busted...  Meh.  I decided to bring one of my criminology texts to work today to read during my break.  What do I do instead?  I blog.  :)  Oh well.  Reasons why this filing stuff is better than retail: 1)  I don't deal with customers or clients. 2)  Free coffee and tea!  Hot water on demand! 3)  I can blog on my breaks.  That being said...I need to find a real job ASAP.  My mother has been making some comments around the house like "So, not that I'm rushing you or anything...but when are you planning to move out?"  My goal is to be out of there by May 2004...so I've got 9 months to save up enough money for the rest of a downpayment, plus a good cushion in case of job loss etc.  I feel somewhat developmentally crippled.  I'm 23 and still living at home.  I feel as if I'm missing out on something.  Don't know.  Feeling good though, because damn do I look hot today.  Candyman took me shopping over the weekend because I have no taste in clothes (not that he'd ever say that...) and I have some damn sexy outfits now.

       List of 100 Things     I've never tried making a numbered list before.  I know some HTML, but not much and had to look up how to do this.  I play Ultimate Frisbee.  I have a boyfriend with whom I've been going out for almost a year (officially)  I just started karate.  I am spiritual, but not religious.  I teach Sunday School at a Protestant church.  I believe in the benefits of herbal medicine and alternative therapies.  This list is going to be harder than I thought, even though I've been thinking about stuff for the last couple of days.  I think of the moon as representative of "the Mother".  I would like to have children someday.  I live in the suburbs of Vancouver, BC  I would like to live either in the West End, or in a small town in the middle of nowhere.  I never want to move to the United States for any length of time.  I generally am reading multiple books at one time.  I have a BA in English, but I don't want to teach.  I am a "work to live" person, rather than a "live to work" person.  I have decided to write more poetry.  I have decided to surround myself with beauty.  My room is not beautiful right now.  It is incredibly cluttered and messy.  I would like to feng shui-ize my house when I get one.  I garden...flowers, herbs and vegetables.  I would like to own a ferret.  I drink diet pop and pretend it's healthier than regular pop.  I have a tenuous grip on reality sometimes, but that makes life more interesting.  I regret most of my major breakups, at least a little bit.  My favourite colour is purple.  I am saving up for a down payment for an apartment/condo.  I live with my parents in their basement.  I am not charged rent while I'm in school.  I'm in school right now. (Crim and Psych)  I distrust sunscreen.  I used to play the drum in a pipe band.  I've been to Scotland twice.  When I was in London, I was given Rohypnol in my wine.  I own a fluctuating number of tropical fish.  I am overly conscious of my weight and appearance.  I have terrible taste in clothing.  I consider the kestrel to be a personal totem.  I would like to try skydiving, due to its similarity to flight.  I like at least a little bit of each kind of music that I've been exposed to.  I've recently begun seeing some old friends from high school.  I have eclectic hobbies...World religions, wine making, reading, model rockets, jewellery making, karate, herbs, Ultimate Frisbee, watching movies, gardening, Internet surfing...etc...  I used to own a horse and competed in both Western and English events.  When I have money, I will lease/own another horse.  I have a strange fascination with doomed, supernatural love.  (vampires/ Highlander/ etc.)  I am a Libra.  My birthday is 10/10 and my dad's is 8/8.  One of my ex's was 10/10, and his mom's was 8/8.  I am hated more by some of my ex's friends than the ex himself.  I like Kraft Dinner and hotdogs in moderation.  I sometimes use Japanese smilies.  ^_^   >_  I have a fascination with Japanese culture.  I've never seen a dead body, unless ashes count.  I try to be fair to everyone.  My boyfriend knows surprisingly little about me.  I spend more time with my boyfriend's friends than with my own.  My b/f's ex girlfriend asked me to be her bridesmaid for when she gets married.  I have four friends who are engaged...none who are married.  I get along really well with my little brother.  I am not a hockey fan.  I am a Vancouver Canucks fan.  I'm getting my wisdom teeth out two days before my birthday.  :(  I think I'm taller than my boyfriend.  He disagrees.  This is only the 64th entry!  I have a new car.  It has brakes.  I can type about 50 wpm.  I read science fiction and fantasy mostly, then reference stuff.  I'd like to write a novel.  I have difficulty staying on task.  I read way too many webcomics.  I tried writing my own webcomic once.  I only have 13 people on my ICQ list.  I get tired of pizza very quickly.  I like to drive.  I'm not allowed to drive with the Top Gun soundtrack going because I tend to almost die when that happens.  :/  Driving fast can be erotic.  I don't watch much TV unless I'm over at Candyman's or someone in my family has the TV on.  I didn't used to watch movies, but now I do.  Mostly with Candyman...  My house has six TV's.  My house has four computers.  My house has three DVD players (one in the computer I'm currently sitting at)  I'm overly preoccupied with how much media we have in my house (YES! MEDIA!)  I've watched less than half of my DVD's.  I think I have 43 DVD's, but I can't remember.  I'm a serious pack rat.  I think I have at least 2000 books.  One of our computers is a Commodore 64 in a box in my room.  I like to play nine-ball.  I bruise very easily...good thing I do activities that are conducive to bruising...  When i'm inside Canada, I'm half Scottish and half Austrian when someone asks.  When I'm outside of Canada, I'm Canadian if someone asks.  I have at least six tops with "Canada", "Canadian Girls Kick Ass" etc. on them.  I sometimes wear glasses, but they're mostly an affectation or to prevent headaches.  I can't keep track of sunglasses.  I want to go to Burning Man someday.  I built a treehouse when I was 15.  I try to believe that people are generally good.  I love compliments.  I eat a lot of fruit.  I need another 100 things list.

       Wish me luck.  Going out drinking tonight...I'm one of the Designated Drivers.  w00t!  Free pop all night!  Friend from Ultimate is having her first day off in something stupid like 26 days, so we're taking her out so she's hungover for work tomorrow.  Heheheh.  Evil.  :)  G'nite all.  May you find the happiness you deserve.  ;)

       Sometimes I feel like a nut...  ...sometimes I don't.  Ok, I haven't heard that for about a million years, and yet it popped into my head just now.  Whateva.  :)  I went to something called "Kata on the Beach" this morning for karate.  It entailed waking up at 0600 on a Saturday morning to go work out at White Pine Beach in Coquitlam with the rest of my karate dojo.  It was incredibly cool.  It was almost another "in touch with the universe" moment.  We had a Native American flute CD playing, wind blowing, waves moving against the sand, surrounded by trees and people who subscribed to many of the same philosophies that I think I subscribe to.  It was a truly amazing experience.   I've learned so much about myself, I can't write it all, or fast enought, I can't write it the way it should be said.  It is sometimes easier to say thoughts than to write them because saying something is living it, feeling it, connecting with it again.  No writing can capture that fully.  In a way, speaking is alive, writing makes it become dead.  What is written is not really a thought put to memory, as why rember what you can go back to and look up, if need be?   --Yvonne Johnson:  Stolen Life-The Journey of a Cree Woman  The above quote is one that I'll be placing on my sidebar.  It really feels right to me.  I have to have at least a modicum of skill with the written word (I is English major...) but I tend to have problems writing about my feelings.  It's kind of like telling someone about a dream...they weren't there and while there was great emotional attachment within the dream, other people just don't get it.  The section below has been thought through many times over the last couple of days and I wanted to write it down before I lost it.  I was going to wait until I moved to my new area, but I'm going to record it now.  Mostly because it feels right.   Life's a journey, not a destination (Aerosmith: Amazing)  I've been feeling strangely spiritual lately.  Last Tuesday I went for my longest bike ride ever.  I rode out from my place to Candyman's...it was about a 16 km bike ride, but it felt like it was a journey that was more than a physical movement of one place to another.  For most of my life, with the exception of a brief time in elementary school, I've been very unathletic.  I was very unactive through high school and university, although I tried going to the university gym and I took a couple of semester long martial arts classes through the schools.  While I was playing Ultimate Frisbee over the last year, I still felt much less athletic (both physically and mentally) than everyone else on the teams.  Slowly this has been changing as I've been increasing my fitness level...I'm able to keep up with more people etc.  By pushing myself to complete this bike ride, I felt as if I had crossed a line in my own mind.  Suddenly I was athletic.  Definitely not of professional athletic calibre, but I was someone who could hold her own if there was ever something physical that I needed/wanted to do.  Another line that I crossed on Tuesday was one of self esteem, but unrelated to the physical side.  I'd told a few people that I was going to go for a ride, but I wasn't dependent on their approval.  I was doing this ride for me, not for anyone else.  I didn't do it so that I could feel good when another person praised me.  I was doing it because it was something that I wanted, and a goal of mine.  I'd wanted to make this bike ride for about a month...maybe a little longer.  Most of my goals tend to fizzle out in that time frame, so being able to complete such a goal is thrilling for me.  Especially one that allows me to cross a heavily marked and guarded line in my mind.

       The air is wild tonight  I heard a poem tonight from the stars?  The wind?  The moon?  I don't know.  Anyway, it felt more like an invocation, and while I was driving home from Candyman's house reciting it to myself so I wouldn't forget, I glanced over into a mini-van that was playing some pretty nice music.  A cute, young guy was driving and we both smiled...me because I was kind of in tune with the universe.  Him, apparently because he thought I was pretty.  The light changed, we drove off, but I was still floating a little.  I turned off onto a feeder street for my house, and he did too (he was in front of me) and he started to pull into a mini-mall complex.  I considered following (incredibly briefly) but decided that I was being stupid.  So I kept going and he pulled out of the mall and started following me, a car back.  Um...ooookay...  The car in front of him turned off and he continued to follow me and flashed his brights once.  Um...getting a little nervous now.  I didn't want to stop in front of my house, so I stopped a little down the street where there were lots of cars parked outside houses.  He stopped beside me in the minivan and we traded names, ages and the facts that he thought I was really pretty and that I had a boyfriend.  He asked if I wanted to go have some fun...and Mother, it was strangely tempting.  We chatted for a few minutes, then we went our separate ways.  It was strange.  I don't know if it was because of my being in tune with the universe, or if I invoked him somehow, or what, but I was seriously tempted to go with him.  Stupid, baka, dumbdumbdumb...but still...  I don't know.  It's hard to put all this into words.  Quick facts...name-Kevin, from Winnipeg, 20 years old, cute.  :)  Here's the poem that I was writing.  It's pretty much a first draft, and only the first two lines were ready while I was in the car.  The rest came to me after I wrote the first while I was sitting on my front steps, half hoping he would come back.  Well, a quarter hoping...  Either way, it's really rough meter, but it feels...raw...like the wind was tonight.  Nature doesn't scatter leaves evenly, and I didn't scatter the rhymes or rhythm evenly either.  This is the first truly inspired poetry I've done since about grade seven.    The Air Is Wild Tonight  I am a child of the wind and the flame Of the grove and the rain. A creature of light, and of love and of life. A creation of dust and of mud. A Lover of beauty and blood. Fate holds a hand The stars take the other And breath is received 'neath the gaze of the Mother.  A carpet, a blanket, a dimmer of sight To listen and give and receive and rejoice. To sing and to love and believe in the light A thousand stories to tell and be told A thousand mysteries, lost out of sight. With a million places to run to and see Somewhere perhaps is a life for me.

       Friday Five   Heh...almost forgot...brought to you by  urlLink Friday Five.org    1. How much time do you spend online each day?   Anywhere from 20 minutes (quick email check) to 10 hours (day off, disinclined to move).  Generally between 2 and 5 hours.   2. What is your browser homepage set to?   An empty screen.  Nothing.  Nada.  My brother, parents and I share a computer and we all have different email accounts, and use different search programs and have different interests.  An empty screen loads quickly and is a good compromise.   3. Do you use any instant messaging programs? If so, which one(s)?   ICQ often and MSN occasionally   4. Where was your first webpage located?  Geocities...  *blush*  That's where they all are right now.  Or Blogger.  I need a real domain...   5. How long have you had your current website?  Hrm.  Just over a year.

       Gragh.  I'm feeling less broody today and for the last couple of days.  Children are still evil.  Whew.  I started reading my Psych textbook last night, and my Crim stuff today.  I think that even though it's three weeks until classes start, profs should have the assignments ready for keeners to start working on.  :p  Oh well.   urlLink Donna  has created a new webpage for me to play around with, but I haven't done anything about it yet.  :/   Sorry!  I really do appreciate it, but I'm stupidly disinclined to do anything resembling work.  :p

       Huh.  Got an email from an old friend today, interested in getting this address from a link I'd set up elsewhere.  Strange.  I think about him a lot, despite not parting on especially perfect terms...of course, he didn't know that, but he will soon.  I don't know if I'm ready to be friends or what...  Despite a blog being cheaper than therapy, I don't want to deal with all that right now.  Heheh...all of you can't tell me that I need to talk about it or anything.  Yay!!  I gave him the site with zero hesitation, after the brief shock of "Hey, I recognize that name...whoa..." happened.  BTW, Otter.  I still have your books and pants from when we went X-country skiing.  :)  This entry is really strangely spacy.  Sorry.  :p  I'm tired.

       Got this is my in-box today.   Crap, I can't get down there until around 11  :(   Greetings from GayVancouver.Net   We are sending this special bulletin to everyone on our events mail-list in an effort to get the word out about an upcoming rally against Bill C-250 and same-sex marriage.  The Canadian Alliance for Social Justice and Family Values Association is planning a rally against Bill C-250 and same-sex marriages on Saturday, August 16th outside the Supreme Court of BC at 800 Smithe Street from 10am to 12:30pm.  We are calling on everyone in the  LesBiGay community to attend in a counter-rally!    Bring your signs, your Pride and Canadian flags and show these homophobes that hate is not a Canadian OR a family value!  If you are unable to attend the counter-rally send your own emails of support for these two pieces of important legislation:  Prime Minister Jean Chrétien - pm@pm.gc.ca Hon. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre MP) - Fry.H@parl.gc.ca Svend Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas MP) - Robinson.S@parl.gc.ca Martin Cauchon (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada) - Cauchon.M@parl.gc.ca Paul Martin (Liberal Party Leadership Candidate) - Martin.P@parl.gc.ca Sheila Copps (Liberal Party Leadership Candidate) - Copps.S@parl.gc.ca Jack Layton (Leader of the NDP Party) - jack@fed.ndp.ca Bloc Québécois (Leader of the Bloc Quebecois) - Duceppe.G@parl.gc.ca Peter MacKay (Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party) - mackap@parl.gc.ca  **********************************  Here are the details from the Canadian Alliance for Social Justice and Family Values Association website at http://www.bcptl.org/events.htm:  To    :   All British Columbians  There has been a large public outcry regarding the federal government’s attempts to redefine Marriage and to amend the hate crime law, by including in the criminal law, the undefined term "sexual orientation" through Bill C-250.  This proposed bill would, in essence, silence any opposition to homosexual behavior. The federal Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois Members of Parliament could easily pass legislation on these critical issues when Parliament re-opens in September. This is the last opportunity for the vast majority of Canadians to voice their concerns about these critical issues that will adversely affect our country for generations to come.  The Canadian Alliance for Social Justice and Family Values Association will be holding a rally to oppose Bill C-250 and to uphold the present definition of Marriage as being between a man and a woman. We urge all pastors and organizations to help make this opportunity available to  all concerned British Columbians through church bulletins and sharing of information.  The details of the rally are as follows :  Date: Saturday, August 16, 2003 Time: 10:00 am 12:30 pm Location: Outside the Supreme Court of B.C. building at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver   If you expect a large turnout from your church, we would appreciate knowing in advance the approximate numbers so we can make appropriate arrangements.  Please appoint at least one marshal for each 30 participants (for the purpose of crowd control), and fax the name and tel. # of the marshal (s) to us as soon as possible.  We encourage all Canadians to make their concerns known to their MPs as well as to take this opportunity to physically attend the Rally to send a clear message to our politicians and judges that Canadians expect nothing less than democracy on such vital issues.

       YEEEAAAHHHOOOOO!!!!  Well, I knew that when I finally got my butt in gear for Ultimate I'd be happy to be there.  :)  Finding out 10 minutes before I left the office that if we won our first game last night we'd get either first or second place in the division and if we lost we'd be battling it out for 3rd or 4th was kind of interesting.  To make a long story short:  (too late)  We won both games!  We are the division champs!!  Wooot!!  We all chased Candyman across the field with our water bottles (he is das capitan/coach) to show our appreciation for his stellar leadership.  :)   Horoscope time!   From  urlLink 365gay.com  Be like the characters of Larry David's show and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The Full Moon is making you a tad over-zealous. So you're desperate to lose weight. Is living on crackers and jogging 10 miles a day really a practical plan? Or you're eager to meet Mr. or Ms. Right. Is throwing yourself at strangers in a bar, shouting, "Take me, I'm yours!" the greatest idea? (Wait a minute, I forgot. You're a Libra. You do this stuff, anyway. Like some horoscope is going to stop you.)  ROFL.  That's sooooo true.

       Ugh.  I am so unmotivated to play Ultimate tonight.  I'm tired, sore from filing stuff, and exhausted.  I got plenty of sleep, but I didn't eat very well this weekend, which threw my body all out of whack.  My back and shoulder ache.  :(   *whimper*  Luckily I've got two flavours of painkiller handy!  Muahahah...  I'll feel better when I get out to the field.  I always do.  Now it's just a question of whether or not I'll fall asleep at the wheel on the way out there.  :p

I've been hardly eating any fatty foods or sugar for the last couple of weeks, and I just had two hot chocolates with half and half added to richen it up.  Ugh again.  :p  Hmm...interesting.  I'm starting to feel broody...(ie: hormones jumping and going "We wanna reproduce!!")  Biological clock and all that.  :p  I'm only 23...not nearly old enough to have a kid, but try telling the body that.  :)   I'm going out for lunch with Cat now.  She will smack some sense into me.

       Whoa.  The computers are fast today at work.  Something must be broken.  :)  Had a good weekend...tame, and somewhat mushy by comparison to some people's weekends.  *cough* Cat *cough* but good enough for me..  :)  I was all giddy most of the weekend.  Stuff with Candyman got really good again, after me being all depressed and zoned out for a while.  Happy!!  And almost all my friends have finished their school for this semester.  Heck, I might be able to arrange a camping trip!!  I did tie dye this weekend.  We were doing team jerseys for the fall season.  Sheesh...after all this, I'd better get on this team.  If we play Saturday, I won't be able to, but Sundays will be fine.  I ate waaaaay too much yesterday.  :(   I'm still full.  Break equals almost over, and I need to check my blogroll...laters.  :)

And here's my email if anyone wants to get ahold of me...  kinkygrrl1701@yahoo.com  Um, yeah.  Could someone please email me and tell me how to put comments on my blog?  I use blogger, and a Mac *ducks* but I have access to a PC.  Thanks all.  I have to run...gotta iron my karate uniform.

       Lucky paper!  Yay!  It posted.  Now I have 7 minutes to write a meaningful blog entry.  I have been carrying a "blog-fodder" post-it note around in my bra for the last couple of hours because I don't have pockets in these pants (note to self...go shopping for pants with pockets, or not...then I have an excuse to stick my hand in my bra at work...woo!)  Second note to self: make more notes when writing blog fodder notes.  I don't remember where I was going with half this stuff.  I have decided that I am called a "stack rat" here, rather than filing clerk.  The first seems much more accurate.  That's all I remember.  I think it was more interesting than that.  I'm sorry.  This was a really crappy post, except for the post-it note in the bra thing.  Um.  Yeah.  Back it goes, break time's over.  :(

       There goes the blogger-hood.  :)  ACK!  Candyman found my site last night!  :)  Cool.  I never gave him the addy, but he somehow searched it out.  I'm thinking because not too many sites have "oasis" and "candyman" on it.  Heh.  So, I'm on lunch, but I'm afraid to write a huge long post because Blogger's been really irritating from work lately, so I'm going to publish this and see if it goes up.  If it does, happiness will ensue.  Oh, and for those two who are writing computer science exams right now, I'm thinking happy computer science thoughts at you.  So that one that you got right that you were pretty sure you should have gotten wrong...  ...yeah, that was me.  ^_^

       Friday Five   Brought to you by  urlLink FridayFive.org     1. What's the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?  Scotland, then down to England.  I don't think I've been down to the States since then.   2. What's the most bizarre/unusual thing that's ever happened to you while traveling?  While I was in London, someone slipped date-rape drug into my wine.  That was unusual in the sense that it had never happened to me before.   3. If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?  Hmmm...Japan and/or Scotland again.  Or a cruise.   4. Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?  I start feeling sick to my stomach if I'm not the one driving, especially on long trips, and I've never really travelled anywhere by train except in the UK, and I wasn't feeling well then.  I think I like plane and train about the same.  (Huh.  I was just thinking I should write more poetry...)   5. What's the next place on your list to visit?  Um.  I'd like to head up to Bamff with Justy and Bimkins, or go to Edmonton to see Bimkins, but I think I'll be going to Kamloops on the 22nd, or over to the island before the summer is over.   urlLink FridayFive.org

       Ooh!!  Exciting Geek News!   urlLink Devon  has linked to my site!  I've been linked!  I have readership!  *gasp...pant*  Oh, crap.  Does this mean I need to start making interesting posts?  AND I went and changed my blog name a couple days ago.  Whoops.  :)  And I found out yesterday that Devon knows one of my friends.  :)  Small world.  I think I'm regressing.  At work, I keep having to slap my hand away from grabbing sugar cubes from the coffee room and eating them.  *crunch*  That was a carrot stick.  *crunch*  That was a VEL bar that was in the fridge. **sigh**  That was me still wanting a sugar cube.  I suppose that's an improvement over the dinner that Justy and I had...somehow we both managed to dress up, he was making dinner, and I brought a bottle of wine.  It was all grown up, and freaky.  So, while he was making peanut sauce, I dipped the spoon in the peanut butter and ate it, bought two different kinds of kiddy ice cream for dessert, and licked the spatula after he was finished with it.  I think that counteracts the "grown-up" dinner party.  :)  Now for a prayer that Blogger doesn't act up again...c'mon...

       Geek Sympathy   urlLink Justy , I feel your pain.  Seriously.  Having not once, but TWICE, missed either a midterm or a final exam, I know somewhat how you feel.  The difference being, of course, that you put a lot more work into your project.  If I was on ICQ right now, I'd be giving you virtual hugs like crazy, knowing that it wouldn't really help.  :(  *big hugs anyway*

       Coffee wuss  1) Decaf coffee "K-cup" 2) two or three sugar (depends on how I feel) 3) milk or half and half up to the top (about 1/6 of a cup)  Oh yeaaahh.  It's all about the coffee crisp...  :)

       Insert title.......here.  Gawd, I'm tired.  Played Ultimate tonight.  Lost our first game, and since neither we nor another team at the field had another game, we played a fun game.  We had a 5 y/o, a 7 y/o and a 3 y/o running around "playing" for the teams, and each point was something different.  During one, everyone paired up with someone on the opposite team and had to hold hands until someone scored.  :D  That was fun...  Lessee.  Up to 163.5 yesterday and down a pound this morning.  I might be down with all the running around I did tonight.  The big pile of clean clothes beside my bed is gone.  I read the textbook I bought.  It's very well written, but very depressing.  "Stolen Life" by Rudy Wiebe and Yvonne Johnson.  I think I'm going to take a shower, clean up 10 or 15 things in the room and go to bed.  I'm very tired.  And this morning I once again proved to the world (and especially Cat...  =^_^=  ) that I am obnoxiously cheerful in the morning.  :)  I plan to do the same tomorrow.

       Random brain synapses firing as I file  Oasis's Law of Idiocy #1 - "Messy handwriting, when it is expected that it will be read by others, is one of the heights of arrogance."  People are very strange and beautiful beings.  No other creature in the world thinks to itself (as far as we know...) "Hmm...I feel like doing something silly and potentially very dangerous.  Rather than NOT do this silly thing, I will instead endeavour to make it temporarily safer."  This is why we have fast cars with airbags, seatbelts and crumple zones.  Why not just take an extra ten minutes to get there?  This is why skydivers (?!) wear helmets.  To make something dangerous just a little safer.  Hmph.  (And I SO want to try skydiving someday!!)  Another thing that humans do which is very odd is drink or eat things that taste bad.  Generally in the wild, if something tastes bad it is POISON.  But, we have decided that darn it, coffee is good stuff when you add sugar and milk and chocolate to it!  To most people, their first taste of alcohol is decidedly unpleasant, but rather than say "Oh, this must be poisonous," (which it is...) and leave it be, people try to acquire the taste.  And we say animals are dumb.  (By that I mean humanity in general: I talk to cats and my fish...even plants and trees...)

       A perfect evening   A joint post by Oasis and Justy  Dinner was amazing.  We (read: Justy) made noodles in sauce, snow peas in peanut sauce, pan fried tofu, grilled teriyaki salmon and tuna sashimi.  Teriyaki (due to the amount of wine consumed during the creation of the meal, the amount of wine consumed during the eating of the meal and the amount of wine consumed during the cleanup after the meal) is now known as "the spirit of the sauce, the essence of the sauce, and everything the sauce is meant to be".  ("ki" in Japanese means "spirit" hence the pun...um...yeah.  Justy was too drunk to remember that "yaki" means "fried"  :)  )  [edit: and Oasis bought two ice creams for dessert...Macintosh toffee and Oreo cookies 'n' cream.  They were yummy.]

       w00t!!  I'm at 161.5!  Happy dance!  That's 10 lbs that I've lost over the last six months.  And Justy's making me Japanese dinner tonight, and my room is starting to look a little less cluttered (read: the piles are knee deep instead of waist deep).  I had a weird dream last night.  Justy and someone else were in it, and I was proving Justy's geekhood by the fact that he had turtles and mine by the fact that I had fish.  Um, okay...  So now that I have my list of books, I ought to put up a list on my sidebar about what I'm reading etc.  I should also change my blog links so that they're...you know...CORRECT!!!  But, I need to call Meesh, so that we can get started on getting her wedding invitations done.  Gragh.  Wanna clean my room...  ...  ...  ...Ignore that last sentence.  I'm going to go run around my head for a while until the urge passes.  Thank you.

       Kneel before the fitness GODDESS (tm)  And my plans are continuing to come true!  Went biking with Kittens (not Cat...) and her fiance today.  I had to quit after 12 km because my butt was so sore!!  I definitely need a new bike seat.  I used my new bike rack which works spectacularly, plus I can get it on my car and my bike on it all by myself.  Useful for when I want to go to Rocky Point or SFU or something.  Went to karate last night and learned my first kata (series of movements).  It's pretty basic, and I've got the moves memorized, but my stance absolutely sucks.  That's always been my problem with any dance or martial art.  I'm going to be getting a private lesson in a couple weeks, not with Crush-sensei unfortunately.  :)  He apparently is "very taken" though.  Girlfriends...pfft.  They stand no chance against me.  :D  So, in less than twenty minutes, I'm off for Ultimate practice.  Gragh.  I tired...  But, my room is slowly becoming more clean (330/400 square feet unliveable) and I'm still losing weight (162 this morning)  Happy joy!  Went to Chapters last night just to pick up a text book and wound up getting a text book plus 8 other books.  Whoops.  That happens when I go there.  I got some pretty cool stuff, and it was all on sale.  Anna Karenina, Count of Monte Cristo, The Koran, a book about Druids, mini-solitare card book, "The Faces of Fantasy" (portraits of fantasy authors VERY cool), a book on herbal teas, and simply so that I could tell people that I own it "The Encyclopedia of Cheese".  All this was less than $35.  I love book sales.  :D  Except for the fact that there's no science fiction or cyberpunk stuff in this list, it is me in a nutshell.  The best way to get to know someone is often through the books that they have out.  Me, I'm so muddled that no one could figure me out by this.  :)

       Procrastinations  Well, I should be a) going to Chapters to look for course books b) cleaning my room c) looking up wedding invitation templates online for Meesh d) soaking the worst foot cramp I've ever had in my life in ice water.  What am I doing instead?  Learning that "blodder"  (blogger typed one handed [while holding a piece of sourdough bread!!  Sickos!]) doesn't get me to my blog.  Oh, and waiting for Justy to be finished working on his project so that we can go watch fireworks from Burnaby Mountain.  Meh.  Off to  urlLink Chapters .  Hopefully I'll be out of there before the fireworks are over (11:30 pm.)  I like Chapters a LOT.  I need it like  urlLink Yuuki  likes anime.  (YES!  MEDIA!!)

       Friday Five   Brought to you by  urlLink Friday Five    1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?  Lately, 7:00, 7:09, 7:18, 7:27.  :p   Different depending on what classes I have or what I need to do.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?  Yes.  Until I wake up.  (often around 1pm)   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?  If I'm going to work I'll get up and go weigh myself.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?  Depends on how much time I have.  Some Saturdays I'm not ready until 7 pm.  If I'm working, I'm usually ready in about 15 minutes.   5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?  I used to eat a lot of MacDonald's because I was up early and I passed one on my way to school, but I like White Spot and I really liked going to Knight and Day at 6 am after my graduation.  That was classic.

       Boo-ya!   Blogger is back.  :)  Had me worried for a bit there.  Justy's been having trouble publishing for almost a month now.  :(  Geez, it's a good thing I have ICQ or I'd never be able to talk to him.  Hm.  We need to rack some wine soon.  Justy-san, let me know when you're free.  Saturday night, I'll probably be at the fireworks.  It has been spoken.  And I'm at 162.5 lbs.  BOO-YA!!

       Takin' Care of Business...  Working today with the secretaries, and doing the mail, and filing stuff.  I'm on my break right now, eating some carrot sticks and pretty much just hanging out.  Long weekend!!  So, my plans and goals.   Friday evening  - hang out with Candyman   Saturday morning/afternoon  (mostly afternoon probably) - Get cracking on the room.  Saturday evening  - Karate lesson, then something.  Maybe go watch the fireworks  Sunday morning  - Sunday School  (w00t! Payday!)  Sunday afternoon  - Either clean my room or decide to work on model rockets or hang out with C/M, or Justy, or ????  Sunday evening  - Ultimate Frisbee "practice" and social  Monday  - HOLIDAY!!  I have no idea...maybe go down to the States for the day.  Who knows?  Three day weekend, baaay-bee!!  This is the first time in a while that a three day weekend has actually meant anything to me.  :)  That whole "going to school" thing didn't really make holidays mean much when I only went to school on Tuesday and Wednesday or something equally ridiculous.

       A little late.  LIBRA September 23 - October 22 Things are progressing nicely. Nobody is asking you to launch a perfume line (like Celine Dion), and your album isn’t number one (as is Mary J. Blige's.) You probably feel more like California Governor Gray Davis having his votes recalled than People's Sexiest Man Alive. But, baby step by baby step, you’re making your mark. Just try not to drool on your bib, and avoid soiling your pants. Although the past few months have left you sucking your thumb, the next weeks will bring you a bottle full of tasty opportunities.

But then I'd be paying rent.  And I couldn't afford to go.  So I guess I wouldn't be there anyway.  *yells so Justy-man can hear her*  J0 D00D!!! 3Y3'M 7H1NK1NG 4B007 J3R R0CK372!  23ND1NG G00D R0CK37 V1B32 4CR022 D4 R0CK132!!!

       Grrrr...  Remember I mentioned that serious hate against Shania I've got?  Well someone stuck in the new Shania CD at work tonight.  Grrr...  Then it all went to hell...  I was on cash most of the night and I had to void out about three transactions.  The till apparently has a minor conniption whenever the wrong payment type is punched in.  *grumble*  I was talking to the till and the scanner after about the first half hour.  Usually it takes me at LEAST an hour to start talking to inanimate objects.  :p  So yeah.  If you read about the evil cash register...that's what's going on.  Not working until Monday!  Yehaw!  I get to work on homework tomorrow.  Ya-hoo!  Oh, wait...that sucks.  ;)  Meh.  I need to get it done and I'm working Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, plus I have karate and Ulti.  Incidentally, my friend from next door emailed me back.  Apparently she plays Ultimate as well through UBC.  *boggle*  Small world.

       Friday Five   This Friday's (!!) Friday Five brought to you by  urlLink Fridayfive.org .  As usual.   Huh...I'm not sure if these are good questions or inane ones this week.  :)  Mostly because I'm gonna be wishy washy on most of 'em.   1. Who is your favorite singer/musician? Why?  Don't have one.  Don't even have a favourite genre of music.  My CD collection tends to collect "M's" though...Madonna, Amanda Marshall, Moulin Rouge etc.  I don't think I can answer this one very well.   2. What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?  Eminem.  I don't really like rap all that much and I can't stand his attitude.  Right now I have a serious hate built up against Shania Twain.  For about a month everytime I got in my car I heard a Shania song.  I got in my car a LOT doing tutoring and going to school and stuff.  I'm just so sick of her voice.  :p   3. If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?  Since I don't really have a favourite singer, I can't answer that.  And since I don't really know anything about any celebrities (except JLo and Ben...living in Vancouver I got innundated with celebrity crap...er, I mean gossip.  Nope, I was right the first time.)   4. Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?  Does Charlotte Diamond or Raffi count?  :)   Yeah, I've been to see Ashley MacIsaac, Nickelback, Amanda Marshall, David Usher and probably a few others.  I went to see a Christian rock group when I was 15...oh, and I've seen a couple of Celtic bands at ceilidhs and stuff.  I still get shivers when I hear "Beautiful Goodbye" by Amanda Marshall.  Otter and I went to see her in concert a few years ago and at the big amazing crescendo all the lights went up in this huge WHOOSH of white light.  Awesome.   5. What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?  Ergh.  I downloaded music for a while.  I don't now.  Mostly because I've got some of my intellectual property online (mostly this writing...) and while I don't harbour any illusions that it's good enough that anyone would want to steal it and pass it off as their own, it's still my work, dammit.  Now, is the RIAA right to try and stop people from downloading (spelling mistake up there.  :)  ) free music?  I don't know.  Is it like stealing cable?  It's still stealing?  I'll think about it some other time and maybe post something.  But I probably won't.  And now that I've managed to procrastinate doing my schoolwork for another hour, it's time to eat.  Then schoolwork.  Probably.

       Ooh, ooh!  Excitement!  An old friend who used to live next door (during the eighties) to me sent me a snailmail this morning.  Wow!  Very cool.  I emailed her back and hopefully we'll do something when we're both free.  :D  Happy happy.  She's actually one of the people that I really regretted losing contact with, but I'm so bad with keeping track of people it's not even funny.  So hopefully she'll find her way to this site (Yes, I gave her a link.  I'm not that blonde.) and we'll be able to do something.  :D  Cool!!

       *taps the mike*  Uh, hello?  Is this thing on?  *gazes out over the sea of empty chairs*  Whoa.  People on the internet DO have a short attention span.  :)  Good to see you all again.  Thank you for bearing with my through my longest stretch of not-blogging in three months.  May it be the longest stretch that ever happens.  Sooooo...not much happening.  Spending way too much $$$ at the craft store.  Started a huge cross stitch project.  Watched the first episode of Alias with Candyman last night.  (GREAT show...want to watch it all...I didn't admit it to him, but I'm totally hooked.  :)  )  Bought my parents their Christmas present today...that's truly disgusting.  I only just realized how brutally idiotic that is.  Time flows at a seriously different rate in that place.  We've got our Hallowe'en stuff and our Christmas stuff all out at the same time, and it's not even October yet.  Being surrounded by Christmas stuff all the time is making me feel like the season's approaching really stupidly fast.  I have to keep remembering that the school year has only just started.  Wow.  I need to go do some cross stitch.  And eat.  Food.  It is the goodness.

       Hmmm...  I am getting very stressed out.  It's only the second (third?) week of classes and I'm already behind in readings.  Not fair!  I started during the summer!!  So, I get the fun ache in the chest from the "oh wow, I really should have started that project last week" nerves.  How the hell did I ever manage to take more than three courses?!  I must have been crazy!  So I went to an early morning (10 am) Ultimate practice down at Jericho Beach this morning.  I should do work, but I'm tired.  :(  So very tired.  :(  I think I will fall asleep reading my textbooks and forget about karate today.  :p   I hate doing that, but I think it will be better for my health in the long run if I don't do any more super physical stuff today.  But first, I will eat because I have not done so yet today.  I'm thinking soup.  I like soup.  Unless my mom has something in the fridge.  Mmm...leftovers...  Or soup.

       Friday Five   Brought to you, as always, by the fine folks at  urlLink Fridayfive.org    1. Is the name you have now the same name that's on your birth certificate? If not, what's changed?  Yup, exactly the same.  I don't use my middle name except on paperwork though.   2. If you could change your name (first, middle and/or last), what would it be?  I actually really like my name.  There's some weird schizophrenic Biblical stuff going on with it.  :)   3. Why were you named what you were? (Is there a story behind it? Who specifically was responsible for naming you?)  My mom wanted a name that she could say in German or in English.  My middle name is kind of a family name, and it's a Saint's name (apparently...) which is sort of the Catholic tradition.  I don't know.  It was explained to me when I was six or so.   4. Are there any names you really hate or love? What are they and why?  I really like Oasis...  :)  Go figure.  Mostly everyone else I've asked hates it.  :p   I like Amberlyn, Brooke, April or various other "nature" names for girls or any Gaelic type names.  I like Brendan (raven), Callum, Andrew or other Scottish names for guys.   5. Is the analysis of your name at kabalarians.com / triggur.org / astroexpert accurate? How or how isn't it?  Huh.  I've never heard of these...*pops into another window*  kabalarians.com's analysis...  The first name of Karin creates a shrewd, aggressive, business nature, intent on personal gain. The desires for independence and financial success have been strong motivating forces from early in your life. You are capable of logical and analytical thinking along practical business lines, and could excel in financial fields, law, or politics. Your judgment is seldom swayed through your feelings. You have definite executive and leadership abilities, however others may find you to be rather forceful and uncompromising. More congenial business and personal relationships would result from being more tactful and more aware of the needs of others. If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life.   Um, wow.  Not even close...next?  Oh wait...here's something for health weaknesses...   Your health could suffer through ailments centring in the head. Also, the generative organs could be affected.    BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Ok, that I can get behind.  Apparently all my weaknesses are in the head.  ROFL!  I like that...  Ok, the triggur.org one is just silly.  :p  I'm finished.  Laters.

       Das craften storen.  Well, I started at the craft store today.  It was fun.  I put out a smeg-load ribbon, and I put away a bunch of stuff.  And whoa...serious deja vu.  (blogger's got a new feature, or one I never noticed...now all I need for it to be complete is for the temperature to drop 200 degrees and have a martian come crashing through my window...)  Um, yeah.  So that's about it.  I'm very tired...my shoes were more than slightly evil, but damn, they're cute.  I will probably go down to my room and read my Psych textbook with a bunch of peanut butter Oreos and peppermint Oreos.  Mmm...Oreos...

       Blogger, why have you forsaken me?  WTF?  Why are my webcomics and archives at the bottom of the page?  Just yesterday Blogger was tagging all of my posts "Lady" instead of "Oasis".  Seriously, this is really irritating.  Probably more so because I'm tired and sick and want to go home and SLEEEEEEP!!!  Hmm...what a concept.  I just thought of something.  I should, ya know, sleep during the night.  :p  (BTW, I do try to sleep a lot of the time...I just have had some insomnia lately)  I'm going in for a blood test tomorrow to see if I'm anemic.  If I am, that would explain why I feel nauseated and dizzy a lot of the time.  Yay!  I get to eat more steak if I'm anemic.  :D

       Uuuggghhhh...  Oh god.  I feel like ass.  I feel as if I'm completely hungover without the alcohol last night.  :(  I've got two different cold medications battling it out in my body.  One is sleepy cough syrup and the other is non-drowsy everything-but-cough medicine.  So I'm going from "WOO!  IHAVEAJOBLIFEISGOODC'MONGIMMESOMEOFTHATSUGARBAYBEEEEEE!"  to  "oh my god i want to die i feel so sick and i still have five hours of work to go *hack*".  Apparently my inner monologue loses punctuation when I'm sick.  Tomorrow I start at the craft store.  I'm so stoked...I can't wait.

       Horoscope   Brought to you, as always, by  urlLink 365gay.com    Damn, I'm prolific today.  Second definition...not the first one...I make the distinction due to an inside joke with Otter and I.  :)  Prolific: 1.	Producing offspring or fruit in great abundance; fertile. 2.	Producing abundant works or results: a prolific artist.   LIBRA September 23 - October 22 If you were a superhero, your name would be The Cuddler. Venus is putting you in a lovey-dovey mood. Snuggle up to that buxom stranger sitting next to you on the train. (It's good to ask permission first.) Cozy up with your long-time sweetheart, and read each other poetry excerpts. ("A rose by any other name would be a tulip.") If Cupid has left you high and dry, drag the cat over and sit him down for some mandatory rubs. (Just keep some antiseptic on hand for the claw marks.)

       Ok, some details.  So everyone is probably thrilled for me, and probably totally curious as to what my new job is.  Well, for anyone who knows me, you'll know that I'm completely into crafts.  Cross stitch, candlemaking, jewellery, beads, beads, beads BEADS!!!  Oh, and jewellery.  Made with beads.  :)   SO, ever since I was 11 or so working in a craft store has been my dream job.  Now, through the wonders of me, I am doing so!  I'll be working heavy part time (ie: 20-35 hours/week) through the Thanksgiving/Hallowe'en/Christmas holiday season and then in December they'll evaluate to see who gets to stay on.  :)  The pay sucks, but it's a job and there's apparently some serious chances for upward mobility.  I think I really impressed the manager when I was talking about corporate positions and management opportunities.  Apparently there's going to be some new stores opening up and they promote from within the company.  :)  Here's a slightly scary story about what happened this morning...  The manager called me this morning and woke me up...told me that she needed people who had complete availablity, so I kind of went "Oh, I have to have weekends off." because of Ultimate and karate and she sounded kind of disappointed.  So we hung up, I rolled over to go back to sleep, then sat bolt upright.  "Holy FSCK, what am I DOING?!?!?!" rushed upstairs, frightened my mom thinking that I was supposed to be doing something somewhere, got the phone number and called her back and said "Please forgive me, I was still sleeping...can I come down for an interview still?  I can be there in an hour."  And I still got the job.  Moral of the story?  Be half asleep when people call you for work.  :)

       How to write a paper in college/university  I got this from my brother's ex girlfriend.  I hate email list spam, so I'll post it here.  That way, it doesn't clog anyone's mailbox, and you don't have to read it if you don't want to.  :)  How to write a paper in college/university:   1. Sit in a straight, comfortable chair in a well lit place in front of your computer.   2. Log onto MSN and ICQ (be sure to go on away!). Check your email.   3. Read over the assignment carefully, to make certain you understand it.   4. Walk down to the vending machines and buy some chocolate to help you concentrate.   5. Check your email.   6. Call up a friend and ask if he/she wants to go to grab a coffee. Just to get settled down and ready to work.   7. When you get back to your room, sit in a straight, comfortable chair in a clean, well lit place.   8. Read over the assignment again to make absolutely certain you understand it.   9. Check your email.   10. Realize you haven't written to that kid you met at camp since fourth grade. You'd better write that letter now and get it out of the way so you can concentrate.   11. Look at your teeth in the bathroom mirror.   12. Grab some mp3z off of kazaa.   13. Check your email. (Sound familiar yet?)   14. MSN chat with one of your friends about the future. (ie summer plans).   15. Check your email.   16. Listen to your new mp3z and download some more.   17. Phone your friend on the other floor and ask if she's started writing yet. Exchange derogatory emarks about your prof, the course, the college, the world at large.   18. Walk to the store and buy a pack of gum. You've probably run out.   19. While you've got the gum you may as well buy a magazine and read it.   20. Check your email.   21. Check the newspaper listings to make sure you aren't missing something truly worthwhile on TV.   22. Play some solitare.   23. Check out bored.com.   24. Wash your hands.   25. Call up a friend to see how much they have done, probably haven't started either.   26. Look through your housemate's book of pictures from home. Ask who everyone is.   27. Sit down and do some serious thinking about your plans for the future.   28. Check to see if bored.com has been updated yet.   29. Check your email and listen to your new mp3z.   30. You should be rebooting by now, assuming that windows is crashing on schedule.   31. Read over the assignment one more time, just for heck of it.   32. Scoot your chair across the room to the window and watch the sunrise.   33. Lie face down on the floor and moan.    34. Punch the wall and break something.   35. Check your email.   36. Mumble obscenties.   37. 5am - start hacking on the paper without stopping. 6am -paper is finished.   38. Complain to everyone that you didn't get any sleep because you had to write that stupid paper.   39. Go to class, hand in paper, and leave right away so you can take a nap.

       Monday Five   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?  All of them, usually.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?  Right now I don't mind cleaning my room because it's actually getting clean.  It's sort of satisfying.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?  Clean as needed.  Sometimes I'll be asked to clean out the dishwasher or vacuum or something.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?  I clean better when I'm angry and/or depressed, or if there's someone there to keep my mind on the task.  Otherwise I'll pick up the first book I see and read it for twenty minutes or until my butt falls asleep, then put it away and do the same thing five minutes later.   5. What was the last thing you cleaned?  I went through a couple boxes of books and magazines and put a bunch aside to get rid of.

       Hot and tired.  I did much stuff today.  I went to the doctor, I went up to campus and paid my fees, picked up books, picked up Distance Ed stuff, gave back Distance Ed stuff, returned some books, picked up books for Cat, got my new ID, got my U-pass and now I'm helping my mom with some baking.  I'll probably go to Ultimate tonight.  It's very hot though and I'm tired.  I'll have to see.  My throat is very sore.  :(  And my stomach hurts.  *whine*

I've managed to limit my disgusting-ness to drinking four cups of hot chocolate cut with half and half.  I blame my cold.  It's got me craving weird comfort food type things.

       Also late...   Brought to you by urlLink 365gay.com   LIBRA September 23 - October 22  The Moon is putting you in touch with your inner pound puppy and helping you to gain closure on that ill-fated Mexican elopement. You're in an Oprah frame of mind.  "Maybe I'm really a Winter, even though I've been thinking I'm a Summer all of these years!" "Perhaps if I only eat protein/grapefruit/air, I'll finally lose that extra twenty pounds!"  You're feeling much more at peace than you usually do. Send an "I forgive you" letter to your gun-toting, crack addict, illiterate stepfather. (Or, uh, not.)

       A little late...   Brought to you by  urlLink Fridayfive.org     1. Are you going to school this year?   Yes.   2. If yes, where are you going (high school, college, etc.)? If no, when did you graduate?  Simon Fraser University in Burnaby BC.  I technically have my degree in English, but I'm going back for a psychology minor.   3. What are/were your favorite school subjects?  English and Psych.  Go figure.  :)   That and Canadian Studies.   4. What are/were your least favorite school subjects?  Always hated P.E. in high school.  Now I'm actually pretty active.  I didn't dislike history in high school, but I always fell asleep in it.  In university I hated "University 101" and Geography 162-Canadian Geography.  I hated it both times I took it.   5. Have you ever had a favorite teacher? Why was he/she a favorite?   Yup.  My Canadian Studies prof and my Old and Middle English profs.  They were just on my wave length I guess.  Oh, and my high school English teacher.

       Nope, haven't been posting.  Nope, not gonna apologize.  :)  I was busy all weekend and mostly away from the computer.  I managed to hook up with an Ultimate team, and I'm their assistant captain now.  :)  We had our first practice on Monday.  Monday was also Candyman and my 1st year anniversary.  *happy*  We hung out and acted cute mostly.  We went out to a nice dinner the night before so that we wouldn't be rushed by my practice, and we didn't go away because we didn't want to worry about Labour Day weekend stuff.  It was very nice, but I haven't put up my horoscope or the Friday Five.  Meh.  I'll do it later.  I spent a lot of time over at C/M's house watching movies this weekend because he borrowed a projector from work and taped a bunch of white paper together as a big screen.  :D  We wound up having a 93" picture.   That's like over seven feet from corner to corner.  It was unreal.  We watched clips of a ton of movies (Apocalypse Now, Top Gun, Face Off, Batman) and watched a couple of full movies (The Big Hit, Blade II) and some others I can't remember.  Much media...  I need to get a job.  I have 80 gazillion things to do this week.  Grrr...  Oh, and I had eight fish die on me this week.  Mostly out of my new tank.  :(  I need to re-cycle the water and fix it.  It's going to be a couple weeks before I can restock it.  *grumble*

       Aaaand...breathe....  The assignment is finished.  Sent off two minutes past the deadline.  But it is finished.  And a serious thank you out to Justy...here's a transcript of our ICQ conversation tonight...   LadyOasis [11:29 PM] :  Busy? Favour?   Justy-san [11:29 PM] :  Not terribly, probably.   LadyOasis [11:30 PM] :  (7-7.3)2 + (7-7.3)2 + (6-7.3)2 +( 9-7.3)2 + (8-7.3)2 + (6-7.3)2 + (6-7.3)2 + (7-7.3)2 + (8-7.3)2 + (9-7.3)2  Calculate?  Due in half an hour...got three more of those to work out.   Justy-san [11:30 PM] :  Mein gott...  So, anyway, he got those worked out for me (would've taken me at least half an hour to calculate them) and I got my assignment finished.  Schedule of what's due?  Term Paper-Nov 7 Assignment from Hell #3-Nov 17 Research Paper-Nov 20 Essay-Nov 21  Finals: Dec 3: 1530-1830, Dec 5: 0830-1130, Dec 8: 1530-1830  (insert random "I'm sick of school" comment.)  Ooh!

Thank goodness.  Now I need to take a shower (I'm still in my pj's) and get ready for work.  I have cramps though.  :(  I needs my coke slurpee.  I'm going to be so happy when this semester ends.  I get 50% off everything at work next week, except sale items.  My parents don't know it yet, but they're buying me a whole bunch of Christmas presents.  :)

       Ohhhhhh...they wanted me to follow the DIRECTIONS...  Well, after Candyman took a 30 second look at my assignments that I did so poorly on this semester he figured out what I did wrong.  So we worked on my assignment last night, including one of the ones that I did badly so that I've now got something to work with.  *whew*  Feeling much more under control now.  Note to self: Read all directions.  Read all textbook references.  Follow all directions.  Start stuff earlier.  And most importantly...  LEARN HOW TO THINK!  THIS ISN'T AN ENGLISH COURSE!  Heheh...  That was my main complaint last night.  "I don't know how to think!  I'm an English major!!"  :)  It competed with "I'm tired.  Can we have a break now?"  I'm so lucky I have a patient B/F.  :)

       Oh for...  Well folks, to put it bluntly...I'm fucked.  And really in a not good way.  I have an assignment due in 2 days, I got 1/10 on the first one, 2/10 on the second one and the third is pretty much the same.  I don't understand!  I.  Just.  Don't.  Get.  It.  Screw this.  I need a break.  I understand the terminology, my tutor marker's comments aren't helping dick-all (obviously, since I didn't do any better the second time around.).  I understand what the assignment is looking for, but I don't get why I'm doing so freakin' badly!!  I'm sooooo taking next semester off.  I hate school.

       Musings about hot chocolate.  1.  Toffee hot chocolate is too sweet for me. 2.  Very hot hot chocolate on the numb part of my face (from the wisdom teeth) still does damage, even if I can't feel it. 3.  If you make hot chocolate hot enough, you can melt marshmallows in it for fifteen minutes. 4.  Be careful with #3...see #2. 5.  I can kill a bag of marshmallows in five days if the weather is nasty and I drink enough hot chocolate. 6.  The weight that I have gained over the last four days is probably due to massive quantities of hot chocolate. 7.  Tim Horton's hot chocolate is nowhere near as good as MacDonald's hot chocolate, which is nowhere near as good as the powdered stuff I have at home. 8.  I don't miss having half and half in my hot chocolate like I did when I was temping.

       Promoting the meme   This is from  urlLink Melissa .  I popped over to her blog for the first time tonight and thought that I'd do this, even though I mostly know bloggers through their blogs...   Pick one blogger for each of these. (The last question is exempt from this rule.) You can pick the same blogger as an answer for more than one question.  The blogger you'd trust with your life:   urlLink Justy   The blogger you can trust with your deepest, darkest secrets:   urlLink Bimkins   The blogger who makes you laugh the most:   urlLink Donna   The blogger who makes you think the most:   urlLink D  and  urlLink Cat  (warning...X-rated stuff in Cat's blog.)  The blogger you'd like to live near to:   urlLink Bimkins  (cuz he's in freaking Alberta...and mostly everyone else I know lives in Vancouver-ish)  The blogger you'd like to have as a roommate:   urlLink Jennifer  (so we can do crafts together)  The blogger you'd like to go to Disneyland (or Six Flags) with:  I'm gonna go with  urlLink no name yet  and  urlLink dooce  because they're both pregnant, and then when I don't want to go on the scary, nasty rides I can say "I'm just going to keep them company" so I don't have to make up excuses for hating roller coasters.  The blogger on your blogroll who is most similar to you. How?    urlLink Bimkins .  I don't think I've told the story about how he and I met up after high school...someone remind me to do that in a couple days if I haven't.  The blogger on your blogroll who is most different than you. How?   urlLink barrios  is just very strange...but fun to read.  :)  I don't think that anyone could be more different...just a feeling I have.  Lastly, pick five bloggers you'd like to have a slumber party/party/bar night with. What would you do?    Cripes.  I'd pretty much like to have hangout time with everyone I read.  :)  Sorry...cop-out.

       Drawbacks to illness...  I've been sleeping a LOT over the last couple of days.  Not good, considering that the Assignment from Hell (tm) is due on Monday.  :p  Another fun drawback is bad dreams.  I had a really strange one last night...  Background:  Last night at work I got to serve a really fat, gross man.  He decided that it was my fault that we didn't have a certain tool, and that no one in the Lower Mainland seems to have it either, forcing him to go across the border to get it.  Uh...yeah.  Not so much, pal.  He was one of those guys who is really creepy...and I usually don't get creeped out by people.  It was one of those things where he was greasy and balding, and fat and talked around a toothpick that had probably been around for the last six months in his mouth and looked at me as if he wanted to yank down my pants and stick things into me... Yuck and a half.  I was all shivery when I was talking to him and got out of there as fast as I could.  Lucky me, I got to be on his till when he came up to pay for some of the things that we had the decency to carry.  He was loudly making stupid, crude, but not quite sexual jokes, making all the people in my lineup very uncomfortable.  :(  Seriously...I don't mind jokes and stuff, but the combination of things was kind of freaky.  He was giving off total rapist/molester vibes.  (Wayne's World...doodilly doo, doodilly doo.) So in my dream last night, I was working at MacDonalds and Creepy Fat Man was in it.  I was working the till there and had to be nice to him...you know...customer service and so on...  Suddenly, the counter is gone, and he grabs onto my ankle and foot.  I'm wearing my new denim skirt so he can see right up to my underwear.  I have to get away from him, so the rest of the dream is me trying to escape without getting raped, because he's going to do that if he figures out that I'm trying to get away from him. (doodilly doo, doodilly doo.)  Yeah, so that was my yucky, creepy dream.  I had one the other night about zombie apes, like what it talks about in the blurb in TV Guide for 28 Days Later.  At exactly 10 pm they all came out and attacked people.  I got to have that dream for six hours...and four "wake ups".  I think I need to recharge my dream catchers...

       Workin' Girl...  Some of the coolest things about working in a craft store are when I'm on a till.  I get to make the same jokes over and over and over, and the audience is always new.  :) I am fortunate to see the amazing potential that people have to imagine and create things. I see what's on sale. I get to talk to people who have the same interests as me, and pick up tips and give them out.  Gawdamn...I love my job.  Even though I was supposed to be off at 2, and didn't get my first break until 1:55 (started at 9...so almost five hours), and it was busy the whole time, and I had to stay until 5, but didn't get out of there until almost 5:30...damn, I love my job.  I learned how to knit a couple of days ago from a book.  I'm knitting a purple/blue/gray scarf out of variagated wool and as soon as I can do well without dropping all my stitches all over the place I'm going to do a burgandy and gold "Gryffindor" scarf.  I like.  Fun stuff.  It's very relaxing...which is good because I've got an assignment from hell due Monday.  :p  So, I'm going to do my FF now.  :D  (edit: No Friday Five?  FINE.  I'll DO my homework.  See if I bloody well care.)

       Worst Phone Messages   (based on stress levels)  From a significant other:  "We need to talk." From your bank/credit card company:  "We need to talk." From your loan shark:  "We needs ta converse a liddle..." From your doctor (after going in for tests):  "We need to talk."  Lucky me...I got the last one last night.  :p  So after stressing out all night, the message turns out to be "Your Pap smear was normal.  Please come back in a year."  WHY DO THEY DO THAT?!!?!?!?!?  I guess because it's better to hear "We need to talk" than "Hi there.  You've got cancer.  Have a nice day."  Still though.  Fast healing is not always good.  I got a complication with my wisdom teeth in the form of a nasty infection.  *sigh*  So, I'm back on the antibiotics.  Incidentally...I hate antibiotics.  They drop the effectiveness of birth control pills, make people more susceptible to yeast infections, and to top it all off...stuff to treat Y.I.'s drop the effectiveness of condoms.  Dammit.

That assignment I didn't do...I was doing it this weekend.  I got a medical deferral until today to get it finished.  :)  Hurray!  My wisdom teeth are good for something.  :)  So I sent that off yesterday.  Thank (the) G/god(des[es])/spirit(s).  (Did I miss anything(one)?)  Mmm...nested brackets.  I got my Thanksgiving dinner last night.  I am happy.  There is much turkey in the fridge.  Mm...turkey.  And me not having eaten yet!!  Well, there is a simple solution to this dilemma.  Bye!

       Fridayfive   Where's this all from?  Why,  urlLink Fridayfive.org , of course!   1. Name five things in your refrigerator.  Homemade bottle of apple/grape wine, fish tank chemicals, water which keeps dripping down from the freezer and not draining, a 12 can box of coke with only one can in it and a half bottle of fruit punch (Candyman, I want that OUT of my fridge.  Throw it out your own damn self.  :)  )   2. Name five things in your freezer.  Non-solid freezing icepacks for my face, Michelina's broccoli and alfredo pasta dish, an "ice lantern" mold for creating lanterns for tea lights, waffles that my mom couldn't fit in the upstairs freezer and half a bottle of vodka.   3. Name five things under your kitchen sink.  About eight thousand plastic bags, powdered bathroom cleanser, a dishrack, wine bottles and stuff from when I was in a "I'm going to grow poisonous plants and make nasty poisons out of them" phase (don't ask...or do ask in the comments!)   4. Name five things around your computer.  Myst-3 pack software, a sign from Homestar Runner set up like a dialogue box saying "This is real.  System report:  Everything is fine.  Nothing is ruined.", a bunch of coloured printer paper, a fax machine and a printer that isn't hooked up to anything and has inexplicably been on since 2001.   5. Name five things in your medicine cabinet.  Birth control pills, belly button jewellery and antiseptic (six different "flavours"!!), Monistat 7, anti-cramp pills, hair care products  (you all probably didn't really want to know some of that...)

       Uh oh...  Remember that whole "midterm flunking thing" yesterday?  Well, momma did it again.  I had an assignment due yesterday which I kind of forgot to do.  Any of it.  Gragh.  Ok, I'll be cloistered for a while.  See you all on Monday or so.  I am feeling much better about my midterm though.  At least I'll be getting *some* marks for that...

       I'm totally serious about this.  Ok, I'm taking a page from  urlLink donna  and asking you to please not talk about this any more.  That includes sympathy or study tips or offers to tutor or whatever on comments, email, ICQ, on the phone, in person or anything.  I'm posting this partly for my own benefit (this being a journal after all) and partly so that people who care know about what's going on.  That being said...(and the disclaimer being longer than the actual post...)  I failed my bio-psych midterm tonight.  Badly.  Not just 49.9% kind of failed.  Yeah.  I'm supposed to be over at Candyman's tonight but I just couldn't face being around anyone.  I'm contemplating the 27 bottles of wine that Justy and I have in my backyard (assuming that no more have popped their corks prematurely.) and the various half-bottles of alcohol in my liquor cabinet.  I had to make a conscious effort to not stop off at the liquor store tonight on my way back down the hill.  Meh.  Not happy.  ...  ...  But the zombie link is back.  This pleases me.

       Not so healthy weight loss.  *steps on the scale this morning*  Yikes!  160.5?!  Four days ago I was at 166!  It really is impossible to drink enough calories to maintain healthy weight loss.  I'm getting really really sick of Yop and etc.  I can now eat noodles and scrambled eggs though, so hopefully I'll even out the weight thing.  Huh.  Now I need to make this into a positive thing, and try to keep that weight off.  (heck I haven't mentioned my weight in nearly a month.  I figured you guys were probably interested.)

       The Cheat...is working.   [strongbad]A spectacle of graphics and sound...[/strongbad]  Hurray!  I got The Cheat working thanks to Candyman's suggestions.  Currently I am running my new copy of Myst...another spectacle of graphics and sound from the '90's.  I got a three pack of Myst, Riven and Myst: Exile for my birthday, so I'm playing it now.  I never finished the first one so now's my chance.  So far I've opened up the cogs and the boat and I can't remember anything else.   New collection:  1980's fantasy movies.   I currently own:  urlLink Princess Bride ,  urlLink Labyrinth ,  urlLink Lords of Magick  (VHS),  urlLink Excalibur  (VHS) and  urlLink Neverending Story I .  I have access to  urlLink Willow ,  urlLink Krull ,  urlLink Conan the Barbarian ,  urlLink Conan the Destroyer  and a few others that I can't think of.  I think this would be a fun collection.  Anyone have any other suggestions for (not necessarily good) '80s fantasy movies?  I can think of  urlLink Dark Crystal  and that's pretty much it.

       o/~All I want for my birthday is my wisdom teeth out...o/~  Ok, well I got that.  (^_^)  Opened up my family presents today (minus my brother's...he gave it to me last night.)  I got "Neverending Story" DVD from my brother, plus a "Matrix Reloaded" poster and a "Finding Nemo" poster.  I think I'll ask for more wall space for Christmas.  (^_^)  My parents gave me money for a Canucks jersey, some butter toffee peanuts (I'll wait a week or two to eat those I think...), a Canucks scratch 'n' win and a couple of books I'd been wanting.  "Vancouver: A Novel" and "Images on the Edge: The Margins of Medieval Art".  It struck me how my reading tastes have changed over the years.  Less soft fantasy and more history.  I think it's a change for the better.  :)  I'm certainly enjoying it.  Ooh!!  I'm disproportionately excited!!  I got to eat solid-ish food today.  Mmmm...lipton's chicken noodle soup... I was eating the broth for a couple days and got to eat the actual noodles today.  And Justy came over on his way back from work with an embroidery hoop for me so that I can work on my multitudes of cross stitch stuff.  He was the first non-family member to see the amazing swollen jaw and bruise.  He didn't run away screaming, so that's good stuff.  (^_^)

       Friday Five!  Friday Five!   Ha ha!  Got mine out first-ish...    1. Do you watch sports? If so, which ones?  Considering the nature of the last post...hockey!  I'll also watch any playoff games that BC/Canadian national teams are in.  Or if someone in my house is watching a game.   2. What/who are your favorite sports teams and/or favorite athletes?  Vancouver Canucks: Markus Naslund, Todd Bertuzzi and Dan Cloutier BC Lions: I liked Damon Allen when we had him.  I was at the game he threw the yards record...  That was pretty cool.   3. Are there any sports you hate?  Not really.  I'm not a huge fan of car racing (sorry Justy...) but I haven't been exposed to it much.   4. Have you ever been to a sports event?  Yep, lots.  About a half dozen Canucks games last year, including a playoff game, BC Lions games, several Whitecaps (European Football [aka soccer]) games, a WWF (now WWE) event and probably a few others I can't think of right now.   5. Do/did you play any sports (in school or other)? How long did you play?  Ultimate frisbee, for the last year and a half.  Various martial arts, on and off for the last three years.  I'm currently in  urlLink karate .

       Go Canucks!  Well, that was a damned fine game.  I wish I could've gone...Candyman had access to tickets, but...  :(  Oh well.  Got to watch it from home, so that's good.  4-1 Vancouver over Calgary with Todd "Damned Sexy" Bertuzzi scoring the first goal, and at least one "new guy" goal.  King...?  I don't remember.  I'm a little doped up right now.  :p  Either way, it was a good game.  (^_^)

       Mm...liquid yogurt.  Despite not being able to eat solid food, I'm doing pretty well.  I'd really like a pizza or taquito though.  :(  Hmm...blender?  (^_^)  Nah.  Not so much.  I should probably take a nap.  I look like I got punched in the jaw...I have a nice bruise forming along my right cheek.  :p  So much for my close-up Mr. Director...  I got stuff to look forward to tomorrow though.  It'sa my birthday!  We had our dinner Sunday, knowing I wouldn't be up to eating much but I get family presents tomorrow.  I know a few things that I'm getting, because I picked them up and gave them to my parents and said, "Here's a birthday present for me."  (^_^)  So, I'll be playing Myst, Riven and Myst III (if I can get The Cheat working...)  I'm going to go take a rest and watch more Sopranos.  Candyman loaned me Season 1, plus a million other DVD's, so I'll do that, do some more cross stitch and generally veg out.

       Teeth update  I slept, I got my ice packs changed every half hour, (thanks Mom!) I drank some ginger ale and Yop, (thanks Mom!) and did a little cross stitch.  I needed to come downstairs for some scissors, so I decided to do a quick update.  My lower jaw, lip and tongue are still frozen.  I have a couple of small bruises on my face, but nothing major.  I'm a little swollen and in a bit of pain but I haven't taken any pain medication yet.  It looks the the ouchy ones are going to be the bottom teeth.  And I created a new Japanese smiley...behold...  (^_^)   Puffy cheeked smile!!

       Ookay...  Blogger's doing not nice things, so I can't get into "View Blog" mode.  :(  That means I don't get to see much bloggity goodness tonight either, and I won't be able to check blogs tomorrow... theoretically.  God only knows how I'll be feeling.  I'll try to post something over the next couple of days.  I'm still a little nervous about going under anesthetic.  I've never been unconcious before, and I'm not thrilled with the idea of being totally out of it with a bunch of strangers around.  I'm less afraid of the pain, and more worried about that.  I'm scared I won't wake up, I'm scared I'll get raped in my sleep...pretty much totally unfounded fears, but that's the way the mind works I guess.  On the plus side, I get to be off work for a couple days.  w00t!

       Probably vanishing...  I'm getting my wisdom teeth out tomorrow so I might not be around for a couple of days.  I'll see what I can do.  Incidentally...doing this fulfills a two or three year old promise...I made Otter go to the chiropracter a couple years ago by promising to get my wisdom teeth out.  So, a little late, but better than never?   [strongbad]The Cheat...is grounded.[/strongbad]  The monitor's not really working.  :(  Oh well, I'm sure it will, or else I'll get a different one.  It's all good.  It's kind of weird though...it'll work right at the beginning when stuff is booting up, but then it won't.  Myabe it's less the monitor and more the O/S...?  But I'm not really a hardware girl...at least not with computers.  >:)

       I guess I should do this...   This Sunday's Five brought to you by  urlLink Friday Five.org .  Funny, dat.  That's the same guys who do it EVERY week.  :)   1. What vehicle do you drive?  2002 Chevy Cavalier, red.  Name of Garnet (aka "Gar the Car")   2. How long have you had it?  Since late June.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?  It's got lots of cool features that Herbie (my old blue Mazda 323) didn't have.  Many cupholders, A/C, CD player, lots of room, brakes and power locks with a remote control.  It doesn't have the same personality that Herbie had...jealous with occasional attempts to kill me.  Herbie was kind of cool though.  He got jealous when I had men in my car and would sometimes refuse to start or refuse to unlock the door.  Except with my brother.  THAT was strange.  Herbie also tried to kill me twice.  Once by disconnecting the brakes and another time by filling the passenger compartment with smoke.  That wasn't so fun.  After the brake incident I bought Garnet.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?  The A/C controls are too low and any drink containers get in the way, the defroster always defaults to A/C and the aerial is missing.  :p  I need to get a new one of those.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?  I'd have two.  I'd have a rocking motorcycle of the "crotch rocket" persuasion.  Probably a Kawasaki Ninja, and I'd have Garnet because I love my car.  Awwww...

       Annoyance  or...  Well, it works properly on MY computer  Yes, but I have a Mac.  The Cheat is a PC, and I haven't seen my site on him yet...but I've had a few people tell me that they can't see the bottom of my page and that it cuts off at the bottom of the sidebar.  *irritation*  I looked at the template a bit this afternoon ([smartass tone]Because I know sooooo much HTML [/smartass tone]) over at Candyman's but couldn't figure it out.  Justy thinks he knows what it is, so hopefully it will get better.  If anyone's had this problem with my site and/or knows how to fix it, please let me know.

You took 2 direct hits and you have bitten 3 bullets. The average player of this activity to date takes 1.37 hits and bites 1.11 bullets. 117192 people have so far undertaken this activity.   Battleground Analysis   Commiserations  Unfortunately, you have not won an award! However, you have been granted an honourable discharge!   The number of direct hits that you suffered and bullets that you bit as you progressed through this activity suggest that you need to give some thought to your beliefs about God.   The direct hits occurred because some of your answers implied logical contradictions. The bitten bullets occurred because you responded in ways that required that you held views that most people would have found strange, incredible or unpalatable.

       *incoherent mumblings*  I'm so tired...I finished work almost two hours ago (yeah, me lazy 4 hour shift...) had some soup and generally avoided sitting at the computer so that I could work on my paper.  :p  Good news though...lots of it.  1)  Me and another new girl were apparently being considered for a front end supervisor position in the store, but since we hadn't finished our probation period (or our first...you know...month...) we couldn't get that promotion.  2)  I've been officially hired as "part time" rather than "temporary part time".  That means I don't need to worry about trying to find another job in January.  HURRAY!!!  3)  The manager has pretty much told me that this being in charge of books 'n' stuff is a test.  If I do good, I get more responsibility, more status and (please God...) more pay.  4)  I got the Assignment Of Death back.  I got 89% on it.  5)  I pick up my computer today, after I finish this paper.  Last paper due until November 7th, with a small assignment and an Assignment Of Death stuck in there somewhere.  Have I mentioned yet that my life abso-frickin'-lutely rocks?  :D !!!!

       Ok, let's do the math...  Now that I've gotten a comment about the evilness of leaving people hanging...I'm not going to say anything.  :)  Just kidding.  :)  So here's the math...  I've been at the store for three weeks.  Exactly.  *pauses to take off "Buffy-Entire Musical Episode" off the random music.*  Ah, Queen...much better.  :)  I was hired for part time, seasonal work.  *pauses for dramatic effect*  I received a promotion.  Today.  Me.  Holy $#!+!!!  Yeah, anyways, I'm freaking out...I'm so excited.  I have no idea if I get a raise or not.  I have no one underneath me, but I'm the "Captain of Magazines and Books" with the responsibility of looking after said books and magazines as well as pulling the old mags off the shelves, sending them back to the publisher and putting out the new ones.  I start training tomorrow...three weeks and one day after starting at the store.  OMFG.  Step one towards management, bay-BEE!!!!

       Whoa...  I have some really big news, but I want to wait until I tell Candyman...  Don't worry.  I'm not pregnant, despite the recent future Dooce Junior and No Name Yet Junior.  :)  Oh, and specs for my new computer...  Pentium III Processor 450mhz  256 mb Ram  60 Gig Hard drive  Creative Sound Card  Nvidia Video card  48X CD Rom  10/100 Network Card  No monitor...don't know about keyboard/mouse etc, but I can pick them up cheap at a used computer place...or I can beg and borrow computer parts from my computer part collecting geek friends.  Anyway, I'm paying $150 for it and I'll pick it up tomorrow after I finish this evil paper.  Must...finish...evil...paper...  Actually, wait.  Must...start...evil...paper...  That's more accurate.  Did I mention the paper is due tomorrow?  :(

       No content...no content...  Yeah, I worked, I slept, I had food, I avoided studying and I tried to start knitting a toque.  (I felt very Canadian, and patriotic while I did that...then I realized I'd twisted the stitches and messed the whole thing up...whoops.)  So that's been my last couple of days.  Luckily, I will be saved from the evil "no content" demon by the Friday Five!!   Friday Five, brought to you by Saturday afternoon.    1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?  Yes.  I can be somewhat materialistic, but mostly I like to collect stuff.  I collect books and craft stuff and other stuff.  I don't like the aftermath of shopping though.  (credit card bills, cheques bouncing...etc.)   2. What was the last thing you purchased?  I bought a tartan tree ornament at work yesterday, and ten minutes before that I bought a 5' x 5' wreath box that I put all my yarn and most of my cross stitch stuff into.  I'm buying another one today...it's only $11.66 and they would fit under my bed if I had legs on my bed.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?  I'm going to go with "yes".  I love actually being at a store and seeing all the stuff, and feeling it...especially clothes and books, but I also really like doing the online shopping thing.  It's so much easier to buy stuff from, say  urlLink Powells  than it is get to their physical location (Portland.).  Overall, I'm going to say I like real stores better.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?  Yup.  I actually stopped getting it in April 2003...when I finished school.  :)  At it's peak, I was getting $20/week and I started out with $1 a week when I was a kid.  My mom's going to take me shopping for work clothes though.  I've got a $400 clothing allowance there.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?   I did regret buying a sweater because the pocket was ripped and I couldn't return it, but then I took the pocket off and it's my favourite sweater right now.  I don't think I can think of anything right now...I tend to make fairly inexpensive purchases which just add up, so any one thing isn't really a big deal.  Maybe my car.  It's kind of expensive...

       Disconnected ramblings   Ugh.  So sleepy.   Ha!  So why am I not asleep?  Because I have the urge to blog.  And check email, and other stuff.  I had a wonderful moment a couple of minutes ago.  "Ooh!  I've got $200 in my chequing account that shouldn't be there... ... ...oh.  A $200 cheque hasn't been cashed yet.  Damn."  Oh well.  :)  At least it ain't in the red, and payday is this Friday, and I'm owed a couple hundred bucks by various people, whom I haven't had the time or energy to collect from.  Which also sucks because it means I haven't gotten to visit with them.  :(  Speaking of which, I need to visit more people.  Who do I need to see?  Meesh, Kittens, Cat, no name yet, Justy, Bimkins ('cept it's more difficult cuz he's in another province...a better reason to visit him though...)  Wow.  I have to go to bed.  :p  Shower first though, with the cinnamon candle.  Mmm...cinnamon.  I should go make some cinnamon toast...nah, I'll do that tomorrow.  I wonder if I'll miss having a payday when I open my own business...

       Whoa.  Meandered over to arwen.org, a little later than usual, mind kind of half there (which is better than most days) noticed that an actor had committed suicide.  Huh.  That sucks.  Something kind of tweaked in my mind (self: she was fourteen and obsessed with him...hmm...I'd probably actually recognize the name since we're the same age...)  *clicks on  urlLink the link *   urlLink Jonathan Brandis.   Kittens and I giggled over him a LOT when we were in junior high.  Granted, she had a slightly (read: astronomically) higher obsession with him than I did.  (BTW, thanks Kit, I still get nightmares about clowns because you made me watch that freaking Stephen King movie.  *smack*  Incidentally, I still get nightmares about really bad movies because you made me watch Neverending Story II...)  So, yeah.  That's my weird feeling of the day.  Wow.

       I'm...emotions.  I don't know how I feel today.  I wrote that crazy post last night late, then worked early this morning, slept most of the day and now I'll need to go to work at midnight.  So, I'm feeling kind of numb, but not with the bad connotations of numb.  Or something.  *sigh*  I think I'll go take a long shower (my most recent relaxation therapy) with my cinnamon candle burning, then watch my guppies for a bit.  I restocked my fishtank, and I've already got two dead females.  Again.  ARGH!  It's so frustrating...I thought I fixed the problem with the tank (it was too cold) but now there's not really anything I can do about it.  I'm going to try and get to the gym at 930.  Wonder if anyone wants to join me...

       Short-ish post  This is supposed to be a short post.  It probably won't be.  :p  Deal.  So I've been pretty happy the last couple weeks, but I always have this impending "Yeah, that's not going to last"...or as Sluggy Freelance puts it: " 'Oh.' said God.  'A challenge.' "  So I had a minor meltdown last night.  Those are usually triggered by something minor going wrong...in this case it was me hormonally blaming Candyman for something that I don't even remember now, and me being pissed off, then dissolving into tears for an hour or so.  It's also often brought on by lack of sleep.  (sh)It happens way too often for my liking.  :p  I'm better now.  There's very few things going on in my life.  I have a 99.9% of the time great relationship, I love my job, I don't have major bills to pay, I'm healthy, I live in a great area of the world and I'm adorable.  However, there's something rotten and nasty inside me saying that I don't deserve what I have, that I'm spoiled and that it's all going to come crashing down on me when the Cosmos realizes that they screwed up and my life is supposed to be given to that chick down the street.  Like in Cambodia.  Am I supposed to be grateful for what I have?  Sometimes I feel like it's not enough, and other times I feel like it's too much and I don't deserve it.  It's really strange.  However, I went to karate tonight.  My mind feels clearer.  I feel better.  Karate is something that I can see myself improving in everytime I attempt it.  It's something which allows me to push myself in ways that I never have before, and that's something I need.  It's giving me clarity, purpose and a sense of being grounded in something that is larger than I am. Being karate-ka (karate student) is forcing me to take my time, to work towards something, but know that working harder isn't necessarily going to get me there.  "Life's a journey, not a destination." and I need to remember to focus myself on that.  Last night while I was very angry and upset, I said something which really struck me.  "I'm going to be so pissed off when I move out and discover I'm still so miserable."  I didn't realize it at the time, but I think that's part of my problem.  I'm one of those people who, if they aren't smacked down, will go through life like this...   "I'll be happy when... ...I finish high school." ...I get a job." ...I move out." ...I find a significant other." ...I get married." ...I have kids." ...the kids move out." ...I retire."  Whoops, I'm dead.  And that happens to TOO DAMNED MANY PEOPLE!  I refuse to let myself do that.  This is part of the reason why I started this blog in the first place.  I have let the stars (moving out, getting a job etc.) blind me to the fact that I am currently living my life.  The only one I get, depending on who you believe, but dammit, right now it's the only one I have, so why should I waste my time screwing around with it?  Um, anyway...comments are welcome.  :)

       Top ten signs I might blog/read blogs too damn much  10.  I remember it's time for my *YEARLY FEMALE TEST* by reading about other people who're getting theirs. 9.  I blog/read blogs over at Candyman's house, when I haven't seen him in days (weeks...) instead of cuddling. 8.  I search out new blogs when I have an assignment due (well, I also clean my bathroom and cook when I have an assigment due...this isn't really a good test) 7.  I bug people in real life about not blogging enough. 6.  I use my blog as a goal setting mechanism.  (weight etc.) 5.  I expect people to know what's going on in my life because I blogged it. 4.  I go back and read my blog archives every so often...you know, just because. 3.  I have to go onto my blog and check when stuff's due because I know I posted it. 2.  I have to go onto my blog and check what I got on an assignment because I know I posted it.  And the number one reason I know I blog/read blogs too much... 1.  I'm trying to start a meme!  So, people who post or read too damn much:  write your own top ten list and comment back to me!

       Bobbing for guppies  *looks at the amount of work still to do on her research paper*  I'm fucked.  Thank you.    The ceremonial "throwing Karin to the lions" will occur at 2200 tonight.  In lieu of lions, guppies will be subsituted.  Justy has agreed to be my second, holding my hair back as I commit seppuku by fish tank.  (My sword isn't sharpened.)  Luckily all this is ceremonial.  ^_^  Yay!  I wasted six minutes blogging about this rather than working on my paper!  And I wonder why I never get stuff done ahead of time...  :/

       Just say NO!   I really like this because I actually know someone who's allergic to wheat, and it affects him like pot affects most other people.  So, listen up to this!  It's some scary stuff.  ;)  Got it from Donna, but I don't know where it came from originally.  Bread & Crime  I've done a little research, and what I've discovered should make anyone think twice....   - More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users.   - Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score below average on standardized tests.   - In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid,yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations.   - More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread.   - Bread is made from a substance called "dough." It has been proven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to suffocate a mouse. The average American eats more bread than that in one month!   - Primitive tribal societies that have no bread exhibit a low incidence of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis.   - Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after as little as two days.   - Bread is often a "gateway" food item, leading the user to "harder" items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cold cuts.   - Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 80 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey bread-pudding person.   - Newborn babies can choke on bread.   - Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute.   - Most bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical babbling.  In light of these frightening statistics, we propose the following bread restrictions:   - No sale of bread to minors.   - A nationwide "Just Say No To Toast" campaign, complete with celebrity TV spots and bumper stickers.   - A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all the societal ills we might associate with bread.   - No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage.   - The establishment of "Bread-free" zones around schools.   Remember: Think idiotically, act globally

       *grumble*  Well, I worked from midnight until 8 am this morning.  That sucked.  Then I slept most of the day and went to work for 530 this evening.  I was told that I should go home.  Um, hello?  My schedule says that I'm supposed to be working.  NO ONE told me that my shift had been cancelled.  I was truly annoyed.  I'm better now.  I did some schoolwork and got a little ahead.  That's good.  This week is the week for webcomics, apparently.  Three new ones have been added to the sidebar...Oh my Gods, Partially Clips and Something Positive.

I even called in sick to work today...for the first time since I started working there.  And it was going to be an eight hour shift too!  And I had to give up a five hour shift because I would've gone over 40 hours for this week.  Oh, the irony.  :(   Recipe for anti-nauseants  (it's all very precise...)   1-2 dashes of powdered ginger   1/8 cup boiling water  (or enough to make it look like  bouaibaisse  soup broth)  Honey to taste  (I put about half as much honey as I did water...I really don't like ginger...)

       What a good idea.   Bimkins wrote this in his blog, and I'm going to copy him.  Let's see how many people will do this.    Flander's Fields  In Flander's fields the poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place and in the sky The lark still bravely singing flies. Scarce heard amid the guns below.  We are the dead.  Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow Loved, and were loved, and now we lie In Flander's fields.  Take up our quarrel with the foe. To you, from failing hands we throw. The torch be yours to hold it high If ye break faith with us who die, We shall not sleep, though poppies grow. In Flander's fields. --John McCrae (1872-1918)   Wow.  This is still an incredible poem.  I memorized it when I was in grade seven, and rewrote it here from memory, even though I hadn't recited it in ages.  I think that struggling with the words made it more meaningful to me.  Lest we forget, indeed.  With all the fighting going on these days, and how it's more personal to more of North America it's important to remember today.

       Ugh.  Busy.  Wow.  I'm working a LOT this month.  35 hours scheduled this week (so far...I usually get asked to stay an extra couple hours), last week was 37, week before was just a hair over 40.  Week before that was around 35.  Despite being at minimum wage, I'm making a damn fine amount of money.  And I'm staying at or slightly below my weight from when I got my wisdom teeth out.  158.5 yesterday.  :D  Happy, happy.  I'm doing some hard thinking right now.  I'm having some interesting thoughts on spirituality and Wicca, and Buddhism, and karate.  It's kind of all jumbling together...  Huh.  Oh well.  I'm sure I'll figure it all out eventually...but by that time I'll be dead.  :)  Cheery thought, ne?  I need to start getting Saturdays off so I can get to karate.  :(  I really miss it.  I need a couple of cheery thoughts to end on.  Um, I had smoked oysters as part of my lunch today...they were tasty.  There's a new Strongbad email up.  It was funny.  I'm not dreading the winter as much as I usually do.  :)  I still love my job!  Good enough.  I gotta dash.  Work from 330-1130pm tonight.  :ppp  Sucks a bit, but oh well...whatcha going to do?  Me?  I'm going to take a shower, brush my teeth, reflect on "oh crap, I didn't do any homework today like I was supposed to" and go to work.

       Friday Five   You know who it's from   1. What food do you like that most people hate?  Haggis.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?  Nothing I can think of.  I get sick of pizza really quickly.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?  Hmmm...that's a tough one.  I guess Eminem.  I can't stand the Rock when he's in his "Rock" persona, but I've got serious hots for him in Scorpion King.  George Clooney doesn't do much for me either.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?  Sean Connery.  I don't really know.  *shrug*  I think Nicole Kidman is hot, but most people (men and women) I've talked to disagree.   5. What popular trend baffles you?  Low carb diets.  Actually, any diet that forces you to deprive yourself of any one food group, or to only eat one thing (cabbage soup diet, etc.)

       Well, good news and bad news.    The Bad  1) I'm getting sick.  Nuff said.  Well, maybe not.  :)  Taking some echinachea stuff...tea and tincture...which seems to be helping.  Need to eat more garlic.  Theory: Garlic isn't actually anti-bacterial like the claims...it just keeps people away to prevent spread of illness.  2) I got back an assignment and got 4.5/10 on it.  If anyone's paying attention, that would be more than twice as good as I got on the previous one.  *sigh*  Oh well.  I'd just better kick some ass on my research project.  3) I haven't done shite on the research project.  This could be problematic.  Incidentally, anyone want to take a survey?  You gotta be older than 18, and take another survey about two weeks afterwards.  Thanks to anyone who responds.  kinkygrrl1701@yahoo.com or my other emails if you know 'em.  Or tell me in the comments.   The Good  1) I'm not completely stressed over the paper I've got due tomorrow.  I had yesterday and today to work on it, and I've finished about 1/3 of it.  I've got all tomorrow to work on it as well before I go to work at 6.  It's due at 430, so that gives me some time to decompress after I drop it off at university.  2) I got a bit of room cleaning done, including some laundry and sorting some craft stuff.  Is there a bigger "little joy" in the world than finding some stuff that you were positive you'd thrown out, then realizing that you really need it...dammit...  :(   And then it becomes found!! And life is good!!  And you still need it...unlike some other stuff that I've found and gone "Holy crap...I really could've used that three days ago...but now it's too late."  That happens all the time with Hallowe'en costumes for me.  3) I found some really kick-ass knitting sites.  (whoa, talk about your contradiction in terms...).  I'll probably post some craft links on the side bar at some point.  I'm lazy right now though.  4) I've found some really good Wicca sites.  Again, these will eventually be posted.  I'm so glad I don't have a quota on bookmarks.  :)  5) I got an Assignment from Hell back.  84% BAYBEE!!!!  Only one more of those fuckers to go.  :D  6) Got some Vancouver Symphony Orchestra information.  Long story short (TOO LATE!) bottom line...if I can get 8 people who want to go to any concert, I can get tickets for $30 apiece.  It's called a "flex pass".  If less than 8 want to go, it'll cost a bit more per person.  Again, let me know, either through email or comments.  I don't know how much I'll be posting in the next couple weeks...school and work and relationships (oh my!) will be chewing up a lot of my time.  Plus, I'll be making some of my Christmas presents, which will also be taking up some time.  Working retail through the holiday season.  Why?!  Why did I choose to do this?!  Because I'm MAD!!  MAD I TELL YOU!!! MUHAHAHAHAHA!!!  ahem.  So, yes.  I might not be updating much.  (incidentally, every time I've said that, I usually update like crazy...so who knows...)   SUDDEN REALIZATION  I'VE GOT A MONTH LEFT IN THIS SEMESTER!!!!  OMG!  Thank goodness...I really really really want this semester to be OVER!!!  I got my course newspaper in the mail today...there's some really interesting cours--   NO!!!!   Heheh.  I never learn.

       *sniffle*   ...uh oh...  I'm not still having an allergic reaction, which means I'm getting sick.  Fsck no.  Not now.  Not when I've got a crapload of stuff to do for school and practically full time hours at the store.  Nonononononooooo..   Not allowed.  So, I'm not exactly working on my term paper...I'm kind of working on working on it, if you know what I mean.  Whoa...panic.  I looked at last week's schedule and thought it was for this week... :/  If that was true, I don't get today and tomorrow off to  play on the computer  be productive on my assignments.  Our roof is getting fixed today and yesterday.  There is much banging and pounding going on over my head.  Luckily I got a lot of sleep last night.  :p  Went bowling with Candyman and some of his co-workers last night.  That was fun, even though I had a bit of a sore shoulder from lifting boxes of books yesterday.  It's really quite sore now, despite icing it when we got back to his place.  I've had this shoulder giving me problems all fall.  :(  It was bugging me through Ultimate and a couple of times with karate.  Ugh.  I hope it'll get better in the next couple of days.  That seems to be the pattern.  So bowling.  I hadn't been 10 pin bowling for ages...like since I was nine or so.  Man, was it ever fun!!  I didn't totally suck, in fact I beat Candyman in one game and broke 100 in it.  Breaking 100 is always my goal.  It's strange, after over ten years of not going bowling, I've gone twice in two weeks.  I think there will be a bowling night in the Tri-Cities.  Ok, after my finals, a bunch of people are going to get together and play some five or ten pin bowling semi-close to my house.  Who's in on that?

Bloody hell.  And what's with Blogrolling not letting me ping them?  *grumble*  (hopefully now that I've mentioned it, it'll work.)

       $166.72 later...  Ok, I think I've got enough craft stuff to last me until...December.  At least.  So, um...anyone want a knitted scarf for Cmas?  I bought about 20  rolls   balls  packages of wool today and another pair of needles...  Actually some of the stuff I bought  is  for gifts.  And some of it will be gifts for me...my parents are very cool with me giving them stuff and saying "This was $75.94, I'll have this for Christmas please.  Make the cheque out to me."  :)  Oh, and that would be $166.72 with the 50% included, so really I bought over $350 worth of stuff.  :D  Ooh, now I have four huge bags of craft stuff in addition to the three other huge bags of craft stuff that I need to put away in my room...or at least hide whenever Candyman comes over...  :/  ...  ...  Crap.

       Friday Five...on Sunday, Sunday, SUNDAY...   Work and school have been eating me alive, hence no updates...   1. What was your first Halloween costume?  I was 21 days old (birthday on Oct 10) and my mom and dad dressed me up as a clown and my dad carried my around in a huge pumpkin.   2. What was your best costume and why?  I have a wide variety of medieval type dresses, so they're probably my best costumes.  Either that or my PVC stuff.  I like black shiny material.  :)  But why limit yourself to Halloween?!  I wear that stuff for fun.  :)   3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?  Nope, everyone's always given me a treat.   4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)  Not anymore.  My mom always buys way too much candy for the amount of kids we get at our door  (2 this year).  Does that count?   5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!  I don't like this question.    5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!   5. What was Karin's costume this year?  Whoa, a personalized Friday Five!!  Right on!  Well, I was a medieval chick at work on Friday (no ladders, thank goodness) and I was an '80's girl rocker that night.  I wore fishnets with a garter belt, denim miniskirt, a wicked black and red and silver shirt with the shoulders cut out and chains across one of them.  And ankle boots.  Hehehe...my brother wore fishnets as well...he was dressed as a ho and his buddy was his pimp.  It was pretty funny, especially when he asked about the costume...  Karin's Brother:  Hey, I'm dressing up as a ho for Halloween. Karin  (not really paying attention):  Uh huh? Karin's Brother:  Can I borrow some of your clothes? Karin:  I'm not sure if I should be insulted that you think I might have slutty clothes, or embarrassed that you're right.  Heheh.  I'm so witty.  :p

       Monday Five   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?   Losing almost twenty pounds.  And getting a wicked cool job.  (I'm permanent now by the way, and being considered for a supervisor position *hop* )   2. What was your biggest disappointment?  Didn't really have any.  It was a decent year.  Maybe spraining my ankle...   3. What do you hope the new year brings?  Beauty, surrounding me, and also spiritual beauty as I try to figure stuff out.   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?  Yes.  Eat healthy, exercise more, continue to grow and mature, move out.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?  Don't really have any.  I'm thinking about inviting a bunch of people (friends and from work) over to my place to watch the Canucks game.

       What *I* got for Christmas  As Justy puts it, here's the obligatory Christmas list.  I got a  urlLink leather computer chair  with five vibrating motors.  :)  It's good stuff...  From my parents, I also got a load of chocolate, a ton of craft stuff, a sushi making kit (comes with mats, chopsticks and book), a Canuck's toque and a blanket for my car.  From Candyman's family, I got a "Book Lover's Kit", a nice pair of red fleece pajamas and more chocolate.  Mmmm...  It's a warm and fuzzy Christmas.  :)  C/M got me one of the coolest things though.  Well, two cool things and one warm.  ;)   He gave me a really fuzzy blanket.  It's sooo warm.  :D  And a nifty Canucks top.  And best of all,  urlLink book library software .  I'm just learning how to use it, but it's super spiftacular.  I need access to a bar code scanner though.  I don't think I'll be able to imput 1500 ISBN numbers into the computer.  :p

       Miss Thinky  According to the  urlLink BBC thinkers quiz  I'm tied between a linguistic thinker and a musical thinker.   Linguistic thinkers:  Tend to think in words, and like to use language to express complex ideas. Are sensitive to the sounds and rhythms of words as well as their meanings.    Like linguistic thinkers, Leonardo made meticulous descriptions in his journals. He also made an effort to learn Latin - a foreign language     Other Linguistic Thinkers include William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath, Anne Frank  Careers which suit Linguistic thinkers include Journalist, Librarian, Salesperson, Proof-reader, Translator, Poet, Lyricist     Musical thinkers:  Tend to think in sounds, and may also think in rhythms and melodies Are sensitive to the sounds and rhythms of words as well as their meanings.  Feel a strong connection between music and emotions   Like many musical thinkers, Leonardo loved to sing, and had a fine voice   Other Musical Thinkers include Mozart, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix  Careers which suit Musical Thinkers include Musician, Music teacher, Sound engineer, Recording technician

       Takin' a break.  We finally got the Christmas tree up today.  :p  It gets later and later every year.  My mom and dad set it up and brother and I have been sporadically decorating it throughout the day.  I picked up a couple of things at work and made a massive batch of fudge.  Hopefully this stuff will turn out less saucy than the other one.  It's finally feeling like REAL Christmas.  I've been living in a massive time warp for the last three months because we had Christmas stuff up at the store when I got hired (in September) so it feels strange that it's ACTUALLY Christmas time now.  I have to wrap a couple of presents for tomorrow, but otherwise I'm gold.  A couple of years ago, my mom made a ton of cloth bags and we use those for wrapping presents.  It's amazing.  Toss the gift in, tie it up, stick on a premade tag.  Traditional?  Maybe not.  Less stressful?  Oh my, yes.  So my schedule is as follows...  Tonight-dinner (our traditional cold cuts, buns, cheese and snack foods), presents from my Oma and the rest of my mom's family.  We do cold cuts because my mom's from Austria and since they celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve they opened all their presents from the family then.  My Oma used to make a huge dinner, but all the kids were too excited to eat, so she switched to snack stuff that didn't take as much time to prepare.  Tomorrow morning-breakfast with the immediate family, Santa presents and presents to and from our parents.  Rob and I usually exchange ours the night before.  This came about when we both had really wicked cool presents to give to each other one year and didn't want to wait.  Lunchtime-over to Candyman's for his Christmas lunch.  His family is hosting it this year, so it's easy for me to get to from my place.  Dinner-Head over to my aunt and uncle's stopping off at Candyman's aunt and uncle's for a little bit.  Gaaaah.  Love and blessings from whichever higher power you follow to everyone this year.  And by this year, I mean all year...not just the holidays.  Please stay safe and remember that no one will recall the little mistakes this time next year.  Don't stress it out.  Hugs and kisses from Coquitlam.

       Christmas...  Wow.  Finished the Christmas shopping.  For both presents and Christmas baking.  Made cookies with my mom today, worked, bought a bunch of discount stuff at work...it's all good.  :)  We have a wicked cool clearance section at work now...I bought a bunch of art supplies and I still get staff discount on it.  Muhahahhaha!!  Very sweet.  And no, I'm NOT spending too much money.  :p  My Visa hasn't melted yet, so it's all good.  Some of my Fishlets (tm) have died.  :(  Kittens tells me that that's normal...but it still kind of sucks.  Oh well.  And WHAT is it with people talking in theatres?!  It happened again on Thursday when Candyman and I went to see LotR!  Are people getting that much less considerate since the last time I went to the movies?!  (about three months ago)  I just don't get it...it's really irritating.  Cat, I saw you called me after work, but I haven't had a chance to get back to you.  I'll do that the next chance I get.  I wanna see your new place!

       This sucks.  My template is doing stupid things, and I don't know how to fix it.  I'm too stupid to do it myself, with not enough time.  *growl*    However, there's some good news too...starting in February I might be doing some aromatherapy seminars out in Coquitlam at a place called "Free Spirit Books".   That's pretty exciting for me.  I went in there yesterday (Thursday) just to look around, and the owner mentioned she was looking for someone to do the seminars.  So, I brought in a synopsis that I knocked together today and she really liked it.  :)  *happy*  So, I might be doing some good stuff.

       Whooaaaaaaaa....FRIDAY FIVE!!!   Da deedle, duh dum DUH deedle...  Whoa.  What key do I push to make THAT happen again?  *peck*  *peck*    1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?   Nope.  I hate the cold and darkness that accompanies winter.  And every time there's snow in Vancouver (so like, once every six years or so) I get snow in my boots.  Without fail.  Starting in about October I start peering at the rain falling on my windshield willing it to not contain ice crystals.  I do that until about April.   2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?  I really like our family get-togethers.  All my cousins, uncles, aunts etc from my Dad's side go to my uncle's place and are all happy.  And most of the time there's no problems.   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?  My Oma made my brother and I Advent calendars when we were born and she used to fill them and send them to us each year.  Now she sends us ten bucks each and Rob and I fill each others.  Which we haven't done yet...we've been busy with finals etc.   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?  I contributed some money to the Santa Fox food drive and sometimes I'll drop off baby food/formula at the food bank, but usually I don't.   5. What one gift would you like for yourself?  A two or three bedroom apartment either up at Univer-city at SFU or even some other place.  I'm not fussy.  :)  Or a house.  A house would be acceptable as well.    WHOOAAAAAA...it's THE END!!  Aw, man...what button was that?

       Mmm...  I kind of wish I hadn't bought most of my Christmas presents...I just made fudge in about 20 minutes and if the pot scrapings are any indication, it's gonna be yuuuuummy.  :)  Unfortunately, I'm sending it away to my Oma, but I'll probably make another one.  Especially since it only takes about 20 minutes (plus time scraping scorched chocolate off the bottom of the pot...but I haven't done that yet.)  So how does everyone like their fudge?  Me, I'm generally a purist.  Plain chocolate, maybe with mint in it.  Rarely do I like to put nuts in mine, but if I get it offered to me I wouldn't turn it down.  :)

       An equation  me (less than sign) death warmed over me=going to bed  Yes, I feel worse than death warmed over.  I feel somewhat like death, still frozen, on a stick.  But I wrote my second final this morning.  Didn't do horribly on it, I hope.  I didn't sleep at all last night.  Literally.  I was up until 0630 reviewing for the test, then I had to get up at 730 so I figured there wasn't much point in trying to wake up again in an hour.  So now, I go to bed.  And try to eat something.  I had a grand total of a package of Liptons Chicken Noodle soup with an egg in it, a banana and an orange over the last 72 hours.  I'm losing weight faster than I did when I got my teeth yanked.  :(  Night night.   thank god i don't work tomorrow

       Note to self:    Don't EVER take cough syrup on a completely empty (24 hours without food) stomach.   Throwing up while having a sore throat already does not a happy Oasis make.  :(  That's what *I* had the joy of doing this morning from 0400-0700.  Woo.  Hoo.  Called in sick to work today...I hate doing that, but I would have been vomiting on customers, plus I've almost completely lost my voice.  I just woke up.  Uuuuuugh.  I have an exam at 0830 tomorrow morning.  :(  I'm not going to sleep tonight...after sleeping in until 4pm, I'll be up all night.  Yay.  *twirls her finger around*

I'm losing my voice...  :(  Maaaan, and I wrote a final this afternoon too.  :p  I haven't eaten anything all day except cough drops and medicine.  Yech.  I got my research paper back.  Erg.  We're not going to talk about that...but that final I took seemed like it went pretty well.  I'm hoping it's not a cough syrup induced illusion...  So, going into this test I had a grand total of 46%.  If I get 56% or better on the final, I pass the course.  Hopefully I did it.  :/   I'm pretty sure I did well on the final though.  Maybe if I keep repeating that, it'll happen.  :)

       A break, punctuated by occasional studying  I'm going to go have that cinnamon toast I've been craving since Thursday when I wrote about it.            Ha!  Thought you'd get away without a guppy comment.  Nope, when I'm excited about something I go into ridiculous detail about it constantly.  Ask Justy or Candyman or Otter or anyone else who hangs out with me on consecutive days.  :D  There's another Fishlet(tm) which eluded me living in my tank.  S/he will hopefully be ok.  Oh well, I consider this one to be survival of the fittest.  If it can escape me for 45 minutes while I'm wielding two nets, two lights and a hell of a lot of patience, it can probably escape from the other (short attention span) fish in the tank.

       Taking a break.  Just doing some studying...need a break.  Feel yucky and flu-ish.  :p  My first final is tomorrow...  :0  The Fishlets (tm) are doing great.  :)  There's four now in my little floaty net.  I think I'll borrow a digital camera and post some pics at some point.  After finals.  :(  Y'know, because I know you all care super deeply about my guppy fry.  ;)  They've learned that when Auntie Karin opens up the top of the tank and some cloudy stuff (hardboiled egg yolk...very common in the wild for them...) floats down around them, they can eat it and it's good stuff.  :)  Happy guppies, happy Karin.

       Wow.   Interesting things I learned today  -If I lose another two pounds by the end of the year, I'll have lost 20 lbs. -Candyman does occasionally read this, but I'm not going to edit.  :p -The Center for Distance Education, or my tutor marker lost my midterm...the one that I think I failed.  I hope I don't have to rewrite it. -I can knit a hat very bloody fast.  I've gotten a lot done on my toque and it's going to look damned sexy when I'm finished with it.  That's my cool things list for today.  Thanks for listening!

       The UberPost that was promised.  Candyman finally got my internet working...it um...wasn't just a single cord out of place?  And I don't feel like a total technophobe?  :p   Ah well, that's why I'm dating a techie.  ;)   So here's that post...written Tuesday Jan. 27, 2004 at 0309    Music, beauty, snow and spirit   A question of timing   This is a novelty to me.  Since my internet connection seems to be malfunctioning, and since I don't want to troubleshoot at 0200 I'll be typing this up in WordPad complete with HTML tags and then posting it with the date fitted in when it posts.  This irritates me to no end when certain people who will not be named (and if you think it's you, it isn't...this person KNOWS it's them.  ;)  ) do this, so I'm expecting some flack.  [edit: I wound up not doing this because it took too long for me to get this up.]  This post has been brewing for a little while, and I think it's going to wind up being one of those "dream" posts where the content is totally meaningful to me, and me alone.  I will reread this stuff, and I will be transported back to the state of mind that I wrote in but since no one else has the points of reference that I do it will only be words to them...you.  It's funny that many people understand that no one will "get" their dream, or feeling that they have but it's so desperately important that it is shared with someone.  I know that the contents of this post (which is rapidly becoming an essay) probably won't touch very many, if ANY of the readers that I have, but I know that it's important to me to do this.  I cleaned out a box a couple days ago and found a torn out page of my diary from when 1991 when I was 11 or 12 describing a dream that I had.  There was very little detail, but I was instantly transported back.  Those feelings seem so fragile when they're being written, but truly they can last a very long time.  This is a really raw and rough stream of consciousness writing, so...deal.  ;)  NOTE: Candyman, if you're reading this...there's some stuff in here that might seem strange and worrisome.  Please don't worry, there isn't anything wrong.  I love you.  :)  And if you don't find anything worrisome, please disregard this notice.  Now that the "make the boyfriend freak out" addendum is finished, on with...   ...the actual post   I'm so tired of being here. Supressed by all my childish fears. If you're to leave, why don't you just leave But your presence still lingers here, And it won't leave me alone.  These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase.  When you cried, I wiped away all your tears. When you screamed, I'd fight away all your fears. I held your hand through all those years You still have a hold on me.  Evanescence-"My Immortal"  I hate snow.  No, that isn't the entire post...you're not getting off that easy.  :)  It just helps to have a bit of background.  Snow and I haven't gotten along since I first got my driver's licence, although I quite enjoyed it previously.  Weather is something that I've often been attuned with...I think that having a minor case of SADS (Seasonal Affective Disorder Something) has helped (or not) with that.  I've always had trouble with winter, often being more depressed, and snow, and cold.  I hate the cold.  I'm always cold, except when I'm too hot and then I get nauseated.  I have a very narrow temperature range that I feel comfortable in.  To me, snow has always been something which on the West Coast we endure personally for three days every six years and laugh about how Ontario is getting smacked with temperatures that we only see on TV.  Music has always been a major source of spirituality to me.  When I go to church, it's one of the things that I look forward to the most.  It was one of the ways I connected with God, and even now that I don't follow a mainstream religion, music is still one of the beautiful things in the world which connects me to the earth and sends me into the sky.  Singing has always been very important to me.  I sing to myself, often without realizing I'm doing it.  I sing to the radio, I sing in the shower (as cliche as that sounds...) and I used to sing out my window when I was younger before I went to sleep.  Finding beauty is very important to me, and I unwittingly found beauty in snow several weeks ago.  Unlike many of the other Wet (sic) Coast bloggers, I didn't mention the snowfall (I think) or the icy conditions.  This was mostly because they and I were having an uneasy truce.  I didn't acknowledge them other than driving very carefully, and they didn't acknowledge me.  One evening, Candyman and I were hanging out when it began snowing heavily.  We decided that since he had all wheel drive on his car, he would follow me home so that I could leave my car at home since I was working the next morning and then we could go back to his place.  On the way back to his place, and on other subsequent drives that night we were listening to the Evanescence CD which I mentioned in my previous blog post.  One of the things that happens to me when I listen to music is that I will be mentally and emotionally transported back to the place where I most vividly remember hearing it.  For Incubus's "Wish You Were Here", I'm brushing my hair, listening to the radio in a place that I was housesitting, experiencing true freedom for one of the first times.  Madonna's "Lucky Star", I'm 9 or 10 years old at my friend Stephanie's house.  It's only in the last year that I can stand to be in the same room as Amanda Marshall's "Dark Horse" or especially "Trust Me, This is Love".  I have practically run out of stores when it was on the radio because of its emotional connection for me.  The same for Alanis Morrisette's "Head Over Feet".  I have several songs which are "flying" songs for me.  Sting's "Desert Rose" and several others are on a playlist waiting for enough tracks to burn a CD.  In this case, we were listening to the Evanescence CD while we were driving along the Barnet Highway and it was snowing.  I remember commenting that I would always remember this one song, track 4, in this context.  This song was "My Immortal", a song which makes me want to cry and sing and love and die, all at once.  (The dying part is small...I think it has to do with the strings...in any case, don't worry.  It's not like I'm listening to Top Gun anymore.)  Tonight I was driving home from C/M's house while it was snowing, and I began to go along the Barnet.  It wasn't long before "My Immortal" came on the rotation.  I turned it onto repeat and just listened to it and sang along the rest of the way home.  When I got to my street, I just kept driving.  The snow was falling and reflecting in the streetlights.  The world was softening, the music was filling my senses and I felt that the world was in a perfect balance.  A continuous cycle...I was in tune with everything.  Beauty surrounded me and love seemed easy.  Life was something precious and people were inherently good, despite what you might believe.  I also came to some conclusions about some things that I'd been longing for, and not admitting to myself.  Things have been changing in my life lately...some stuff I've blogged about, other stuff I haven't even shared with my closest friends.  Change, while it may be good, is scary.  I've been scared, but as I drove around tonight the world seemed to be safer.  Things may be changing, but I'm feeling more prepared for it than I have been in a long time.  I tried to find Justy's spot overlooking the city, but I couldn't, so I just let myself drive for a while.  I came down off the mountain and arrived at my house.  It was raining again.

       You have just won one million dollars:  Whoa, really?  Do I have to send you money for me to get mine?  Oh...it's just this week's Friday Five.  :)   1. Who do you call first?  The lottery corporation to make sure that it's really true.   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  Put a serious downpayment on an apartment or condo or a reasonable house.  This way, my monthly payments are fairly low.   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  A first edition (1984) hardcover copy of "Neuromancer" for Justy.   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?  Yeah.  Some worthwhile charities, help pay off some bills for some friends, maybe give $500 to some people.  Random acts of kindness.   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?   Most of it...I figure living off the interest is a good way to do it.  I probably wouldn't even quit my job...I'd be able to work at a job I love and use all the money I made there for fun stuff.  Use the interest for paying bills.

       Flood, pestilence, fire, famine...  Well, I can't speak for the last two (unless you count the diet I was planning on starting as famine...) but we have a leak in our basement.  Again.  The last time this happened was about six years ago and it got a lot of stuff soaked.  It got within a meter of my room last time.  This time, it's only about half a meter from the wall it started at, so that's good.  Unfortunately, the forecast (thanks Justy for looking it up for me) is typical January/February Vancouver weather.  'Tonight is "Rain, at times heavy".  Tomorrow is "Rain".  Saturday is "Chance of showers".'  I got home from Candyman's and it was suggested to me that I move some of my books that were in cardboard shelves and boxes.  Yeah...books and water, not a good thing.  The pestilence?  Many, many spiderwebs surrounding said books.  Ick.

       I am so smart!  S-M-R-T...  Just tried an  urlLink IQ test .  Don't know how accurate it is, but it says I'm smart, so it must be phenomenally clever itself.  :)  My IQ is apparently 135, and Mensa accepts people with IQ's over 130.  Woot.  The rest of it:  "We also compared your answers with others who have taken the test. According to the sorts of questions you got correct, we can tell your Intellectual Type is a Visionary Philosopher.  This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways. Like Plato, your exceptional math and verbal skills make you very adept at explaining things to others — and at anticipating and predicting patterns. And that's just some of what we know about you from your IQ results."  Now send us $15 and we'll tell you more about yourself.  Erm, no thanks.  :)  Try it out and tell me your score if you want.

       I'm not supposed to be awake yet...  I've been up for the last hour.  This is weird...if I don't have to, I'm NEVER up before there are four numbers on the clock...or even three again.  I'm a big fan of sleeping in until 1pm or so.  Of course, I almost never go to bed before 2 am...so I guess it all works out.  I'm going to the Everything to do with Sex show tonight with Candyman.  Anyone else going tonight?

       At least it's not about a haircut...  My room smells like fresh laundry...something which occurs on a less than regular basis.  I have a ridiculously huge amount of clothes, due to my penchant for hitting V.V. Boutique and stocking up a couple of years ago, and never getting rid of anything.  I rarely do the Value Village thing anymore, but I still have an enormous amount of clothes.  Hence, I rarely do laundry because I've always got lots of stuff to wear.  By the time I get to the end of my pile of clean clothes, they don't smell like fresh laundry anymore.  I just felt like posting this.  Yeah.  Working tonight from 3:30-9:30, allegedly.  I usually go about twenty minutes past the punch out time, which I have no problem with.  I'm so tired though.  I've been exhausted for the last couple of days, despite sleeping a lot.  Not TOO much, which can also make one tired, but enough that I shouldn't be sleepy.  And I think I'm going to dye my hair burgandy tonight.  I've had the dye for a week or so, but haven't had a chance to do anything with it.

       Insert title here  I was pretty grumpy Sunday when I did the Friday five.  :p  Oh well.  I can tell...dunno if anyone else can.  Helped no name yet paint her apartment a little on Saturday.  That was cool...I've never done any painting before.  Got to meet a boy.  :)  Finally.  :)  It's strange...I read all these people's blogs and I'm meeting a bunch of them all at once.  I'm a little tired, so punctuation and flow of thought will be going out the window.  I'm uncomfortably crampy.  :(  I slept a bunch today...day off.  I wound up crashing at C/M's last night because I had what I believe to be a minor migraine.  Sensitive to light, major headache, but no nausea (for ONCE in my fricking life...).  He tried to wake me up around 4 am, but I was really unable to  drive  walk.  I don't have to work until 3:30 tomorrow afternoon, so I'll be sleeping in...since I slept through a lot of this afternoon and probably won't be able to get to sleep until around four. *grumble*  I did some rubber stamping today.  It's the first time since I was about ten that I've done any and I'd forgotten how much fun it was.  I'd bought a bunch of stamps and ink and embossing powder from work and was just playing with the stamps and ink.  Maybe tomorrow I'll break out the iron and the embossing powder and get serious.  :)  I'm planning on having a table at the Vancouver Flea Market in the next couple of weeks.  Does anyone want to kick in some money for it and I'll sell some of your stuff?  Research will be forthcoming and I'll get more details in the next little while.  Allegedly.

       Friday Five   1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?   Nothing.   2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?  Nope, didn't get it in on time.  Standard stuff, including "Ex-boyfriend's initials: we'll be together forever" etc.  Something stupid about Magic in the cafeteria and RPG's.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?  I don't really like vanity plates.  Probably something profound in six letters or numbers or less.   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?  Name, birthday, Happy 21st Birthday etc.  Nothing too exciting.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?  I want to be cremated, no headstone.  I'd like my headstone to be a tree or a rock or something.

       Finally figured it out.  A couple of months ago the aerial antenna on my car vanished, leaving only the screw where it should have been.  I didn't notice it for a while, so I'm not sure how long it had been missing because I rarely listen to the radio in my car...the novelty of having a CD player hasn't worn off yet.  I told myself I'd head down to Lordco and pick up a replacement.  Never did.  Then, three weeks ago I noticed that the aerial was back!  Like, had someone borrowed it?!  Or had a random person decided to swap their old one and noticed that mine was missing?  So, I finally remembered to ask around and it turns out that my dad had replaced it about three months ago.  :)  Thanks Dad!  In other news:  I took my mom out for her birthday "Death by Chocolate" that I had never gotten around to doing with her.  Her b-day is in March, BTW.  We had a great time.  :)  Chatted about nothing for almost two hours.  Happy.  She and I tend to have really good talks when we actually get going.  I enjoyed having a whole day off.  :)  Tomorrow I will attempt to help no name yet and Mr. no name yet get their apartment painted before no name yet Jr. arrives.  I've never painted walls before.  I feel that I will probably be wearing an assortment of colours by the end of the day.  This pleases me.  I've always wanted to be various shades of greens and reds.  Plus it will be practice for when I buy my own place, hopefully in May.  Finally, for those who missed my casual mention of it at the end of my "year in review", I got the supervisor position I was trying to get.  Hurray!  Came with a raise and guaranteed hours.  Of course, next week I'm short of those hours.   Siiiiigh.  But it means I get to spend more time resting, crafting and seeing my wonderful, loving boyfriend.  :)  If he doesn't have too much homework...  ;)

       Yay!  Much cool stuff ensued last night.  I finally got to meet  urlLink d  last night at her Wicca study group.  I feel very good about this.  I'd never thought about trying to practice Wicca with a group before, thinking of myself more as a solitary, or with one other person to mentor me.  This is looking good though.  :)  I'm happy with it.  And not only is d really nice and slightly crazy in the same way that I am, she's also a craft person.  *giggle*  Who knew?!  Hopefully she and I will be able to do a craft day out in the suburbs where a bunch of the good shops are.  She's also trying to arrange a day with a bunch of people..work permitting, I'm so there.   Sooooo, Friday Five!  Oh.   It's just the same stuff from last week.  :(  Oh well!

Payday on Friday, starting to do some landscape paintings and sketches   3. ...this year?  Getting my own business going and moving out   4. ...over the next five years?  Staying in touch with family and friends, growing up a little.   5. ...for the rest of your life?  Either finding, or finding out that I've got, someone to spend the rest of my life with.  Having kids.  Oh, and chocolate.  I'm definitely looking forward to a pseudo-chocolate which is good for me.

       2003-Year in Review   Last updated: January 4th  January:  -nearly got broken up with by Candyman due to some stupid things I said, although I didn't learn this until later...like March or April. -began what should have been my final semester of school.  Three fun classes:  hockey, archaeology and history. -C/M's birthday gifts went over very well...Tenacious D CD and some other stuff. -Thanks to the wonders of ICQ, began chatting lots with Bimkins and Justy -Tutoring and teaching at the church are my sources of income -Began taking "capoeira", a Brazilian martial art  February: -Got to see Daredevil on opening day, Valentine's Day.  Had an amazing Valentines, complete with pre-lunch cuddling, lunch at Milestones (our first date place) and Daredevil.  Later in doghouse for forgetting we saw Daredevil on Valentines.  Whoops.  :/ -Play a little bit of T-Cup Ultimate, TriCities Ultimate League.  March: -My mother's birthday.  I STILL owe her her present...dessert and drinks at Death By Chocolate. -St Patrick's Day.  I completely forgot about it.  Some Celt *I* am. -Begin looking into Wicca as a religion again, rather than a strange hippy thing.  Ditto for Zen Buddhism.  April: -Kittens' birthday.  Uh, I forget what I got her.  I think it was nice though... -Finished all my classes.  Taking the summer off...w00t!  My grades are pretty good.  May: -Vegging out.  That's pretty much it.  Working some. -Begin playing summer Ultimate.  Sprain my ankle less than a week into the season and I'm gone for five weeks.  June: -Herbie (my old car) pulls a "Hal 9000" and tries to kill me on my way back from tutoring.  I have a new car at the end of the week. -Rob's (little brother) 19th birthday.  I got him a T-shirt with his driver's licence on it and Candyman, my cousin Erin and I take him out to the pub. -Begin playing Ultimate again, and roll my ankle again.  Off for three weeks.  July: -still vegging out.  It's good. -Playing Ultimate, this time with a support brace.  My GOD, it's the best support brace EVER!!! -Start this blog, mainly to try and make myself change into the person I want me to be.  It seems to be at least partly working.  I'm much happier now than I have been in years.  Is this because I'm changing first, or is this blog changing me?  Who knows?  August: -I fill in at Cat's work.  I decide that I'm never EVER working in an evil office environment.  Unless I get very very rich.  More than they'd be willing to pay me, I think. -I begin karate classes with  urlLink Shintokukai Karate-do .  It is wonderful.  Happiness  September: -I get the job of my dreams...craft store!  Hurrah! -I start unnecessary classes.  Stupid, baka.  They're scary classes.  I worry. -I get a promotion at the craft store and stop working at the church -I begin assistant captaining my own Ultimate team.  It's a lot of commitment!  I think I might stick to being a player for a while.  October -I finally get my wisdom teeth taken out.  It sucks.  Enough said. -My birthday!  Many good things, and lots of pictures of me with a swollen jaw. -I dress up my brother as a hooker for Hallowe'en.  My parents are so proud.  ;)  I also get to wear fishnets with my costume.  November -Freaking out about classes.  They're not doing well. -Still love my job! -Seriously looking into Wicca and Zen Buddhism as a spiritual path -learn how to knit.  Many scarves ensue.  December -Finals.  Flu.  Bad combo. -Grades=meh.  I didn't fail anything... -might start doing aromatherapy seminars -starting a major project which is semi-going.  It has to do with horses.  :) -Got a real promotion at work...raise and everything.  This actually happened December 31.  Happy new year to me!!

       Music Meme  10 songs from my playlist in random order.  I started with Leonard Cohen, Everybody Knows, but I guess that doesn't count.  500 Miles, The Proclaimers These Dreams, Heart Drive, Incubus Cape, Guy Clark Where the Streets Have No Name, U2 Sounds of Nature, Japanese Flute Sayings, Ralph Wiggum Frozen Puck to the Head, Arrogant Worms Crooked Jack, Best of Irish Pub Songs Come As You Are, Nirvana (MTV Unplugged)  It's pretty representative, actually.  :)

       Hardcore Vinyl  With a title like that, you'd think this is going to be a dirty post...but not so much.  My brother, his two friends and I are listening to records including Leonard Cohen and "The Graduate" soundtrack.  This pleases me.  In other news,  urlLink the movie that should probably not be made  is being made...at least that was my first impression.  I remember the major kerfuffle that happened when Paul Reubens was caught doing something naughty, but I never knew what it was really was until I did a bit of research.  So it was a big shock to me that all he was doing was jerking off in a porn theatre.  Wow.  What an innocent world we had in 1991.  I kind of miss it.

       It's all about the numbers.  Today at work I was thinking about this blog entry.  So here it is, in all it's "glory".  Number of... ...hours of sleep I got last night= 2-4 ...managers on duty today= 3 ...co-workers who should have been helping me this morning= 5 ...people who actually were there= 2 ...minutes late the other supervisor was= 134 ...customers through my till today= 348 ...customers who asked if the sale was on today (it starts tomorrow)= ~200 ...customers who were POSITIVE that the coupon/sale started today (it starts TOMORROW)= 143 ...customers who asked me to ring X, Y or Z through at the sale price anyway (sales start on certain days for a reason! Hello?!)= 87 ...customers who decided that it was my fault and should damned well change the policy= 43 ...customers who demanded to see the manager= 18 ...customers who should go fuck themselves= 87 by the end of the day.  :p ...minutes of time I was over my shift today= 58 ...minutes of break that I didn't get= 27 ...seconds that I'm going to regret not being at work tomorrow=  ZERO  Heheh.  I get the first Saturday of a huge sale off tomorrow.  I am so incredibly happy...you have no idea.

       Another great mystery of life  Okay.  I like to think of myself as a relatively intelligent person who has a fairly good grasp on the kinesiology of my body.  Not necessarily at the "Gray's Anatomy" level, but I play sports and have a pretty good idea as to how my body works (despite being a super-klutz).  So, I pose this question, dear reader.  Why is it that whenever I get out of the shower and go to get dressed I always find a big wet patch somewhere on my body that I didn't notice?  It's not like my towels are small.  My hair is fairly short, so it's not dripping.  Am I simply in too much of a hurry?  Does the water MOVE?  Does anyone else have this problem?!

       What's a girl to do?  Ok, I think I've discovered the conspiracy.  The number one thing keeping me from doing the stuff I want to do boils down to a simple piece of cloth.  A common item of clothing, which most of you also have in your closet, drawers or under the bed.  It's a disgrace, I tell you!  It's nothing less than a terrible fiendish plot, probably by the Bush administration, to prevent Canadians from thinking for themselves and getting things done.  Pajamas.  That's right, I said pajamas.  That innocuous, seemingly innocent article of clothing which you...SLEEP in.  I mean, how diabolical is that?  Not only are you comfortable and warm, but you find yourself feeling as if it's still early in the morning, and therefore, that you don't have to actually do anything.  I discovered this early this morning, but since I was still in my jammies (ed: see, another fiendish part of the plot!  Cutesy nicknames counteract the seriousness with which we should be taking this threat!) I didn't get this post written.  Personally, I think that pajama manufacturers are in league with free and cheap game manufacturers.  Mostly what I did all day was sit around and play Yahoo Games.  It wasn't until I was given a clear motivation to get out of the house that I actually ate anything, got dressed or did anything remotely productive.  DOWN WITH PAJAMAS!!  Everyone should always sleep naked...except in the winter when we should all be hibernating anyway.

       Woot, Ultimate is back!   *happy dance*  Played Ultimate this morning, in the absolutely GORGEOUS sunshine.  What a mindblowing difference from the gale force winds and almost freezing rain last week.  I got to run around in my sports bra for a lot of it, and didn't really feel it.  One of the teams we played was completely stacked...it was weird!  They had three girls playing for them who also play for "Prime", the Canadian women's championship team, and most of the guys were really good as well.  One of them I knew from Fall league and he's been playing for 14 years...or since he was 10.  However, we did manage to get the lead a couple of times and the final score was a respectable 13-8.  The second game we won.  It was close though.  14-12.  :)  All in all it was a good day.  Helped my brother out with a film project he's doing for his TV and Film class.  I got to push a stuffed dog out of a moving car while I was hiding, so it looked like it fell out, and then I got to be a person walking past who finds it and gives it back to the owner.  Heheh.  :)  It was amusing and killed a couple hours.

       Oh.  Great.   Figures.  The one book that I've read that I simply cannot stand...the one that makes me want to vomit every time I think of it...         You're  Lolita !   by Vladimir Nabokov     Considered by most to be depraved and immoral, you are obsessed with sex. What really tantalizes you is that which deviates from societal standards in every way, though you admit that this probably isn't the best and you're not sure what causes this desire. Nonetheless, you've done some pretty nefarious things in your life, and probably gotten caught for them. The names have been changed, but the problems are real. Please stay away from children.

       Friday night, and home alone.  Justy's out playing pool.  Candyman's helping out G and K for their wedding tomorrow.  I'm sitting here going back and forth between refreshing my blog roll and sewing a skirt.  Siiiiigh.  I'm bored.  Not in the "I have nothing to do" way, but in the "I don't feel like doing any of the things I should be doing" way.

       Continuing the meme   Links upon links upon...   urlLink Donna  wrote about  urlLink Darren  who wrote about  urlLink someone  collecting money for flowers for gay and lesbian couples getting married in San Francisco.  Darren started  urlLink Flowers for Al and Don  and is collecting for the same thing.  I think this is a really cool idea.  I sent two bucks.  HOWEVER!  I would like to make the call out that you match whatever you give to this with a donation of the same amount to the food bank or something.  While this is a great way of showing support, it seems a shame to be sending this money when it can be used for other purposes as well.  So, I'd like to call attention to your local food bank.  The time after Christmas is tough for them, so please match your flower donation with one for the food bank.  I'll be buying some baby food to donate tomorrow.  (/me steps down off my soapbox)

       A very good day  Today was one of those days where I was simply giddy with life.  Went to the mall with Justy this afternoon to buy him a pool cue.  I sucessfully did not buy three DVD's for $6.88 each at Walmart.  I am very proud of myself.  Bought some material to try sewing a cloak.  :)  That should be fun.  We came back here and knocked some quesadillas together and shot some pool.  Went to work and wound up randomly giggling out loud every so often just because my life rocked.  My shift went well, the poison people were nice and I got a whole swack of stuff done.  Not just a portion of a swack, but a whole swack.  I am very happy.

       Working...  Wow.  Talking to my manager about needing more hours netted me another 16 this week.  That's up from 15.  This is good...I might be able to pay most of my bills next month.  :)  Although I need 31+ hours  EVERY week...not just every so often.  I'm scheduled for 21 hours next week...theoretically it should be easier to pick up nine hours than sixteen...so we'll see.

       Can of worms: Open   From  urlLink Donna    12 Reasons Same-Sex Marriages Will "Ruin" Society:   1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control.  2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children.  3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.  4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.  5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.  6. Gay marriage should be decided by people not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.  7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire counrty. That's why we have only one religion in America.  8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.   9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.  10. Children can never suceed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.  11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer lifespans.  12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.

       Disgusted and saddened.  I used to love my job.  I think I made about thirty gazillion posts about how much I love my job.  I think I would still love it if I wasn't a supervisor.  I don't really like being a supervisor.  I don't make a very good supervisor.  *sigh*  I had a cashier shift tonight, and didn't really like it much either.  I think part of that has to do with the fact that there are a couple of severely poisonous individuals working there.  That can't help.  That's the sad part.  Here's the disgusted part.  We carry magazines in this store.  Every week we take those magazines that are old, rip the covers off and send the covers back to the publisher.  We then proceed to throw away the rest of the magazine.  Throw.  Away.  We cleaned out a bunch of old magazines today and there was more than an entire shopping cart filled with paper that no one had looked at and which was going to a landfill tomorrow.  And this amount of paper gets pitched every month by my estimate.  This is in one store.  I felt like throwing up.  There is so much stuff thrown away each day in this store...Justy can vouch for this.  We compact the cardboard boxes and those allegedly get recycled, but Big Business has decreed that anything which is getting thrown away cannot be donated to charity or taken home by employees.  I can see their point.  No, I really can.  I mean, many people would "break" something so that they could take it home.  But this wholesale destruction and waste is truly mindboggling and I don't think I can deal with it.  I've started looking for another job.  This isn't the entire reason, but it's one of many...and I was questioning whether or not I wanted to be in this job when this was brought to my attention.  Another thing which made me feel sick was the attitude of one of the employees.  I brought it to her attention that there were alternatives to just trashing this stuff.  Her response:  "You think they're going to care what one associate thinks?"  Huh.  Well, thanks for making me feel about this tall.  One person might not be able to change the world, but maybe they can change three people's minds.  Then each of them does the same.  THAT'S how you change the world.

       What a world.  I was driving home from Candyman's last night/this morning at around 2 am and I passed a woman who was hitchhiking in Port Moody.  Now, I'm not sure, but I think the buses might have stopped running.  It was raining.  It was cold.  I wanted to stop and give her a ride, but I was worried about doing so.  All of the what-if's swirled through my mind.  What if she was going to attack me?  What if there was someone hiding in the bushes that's her accomplice?  What if she was going to try and steal my car?  I feel guilty about it.  I didn't stop.

       "Friday Fourteen"-To my love   Fourteen reasons (of many) why I love you.   You care about my health, mental and physical. You cook the most amazing meals...AND clean up after them. You buy me lingerie without me asking and remember my size. You encourage me to do what I love. You help me with things I don't like doing (financial stuff...ewww...) You introduced me to the aural delights that are Leonard Cohen and Pink Floyd. You build my self esteem...not with empty compliments, but by helping me find my own inner strength. You aren't threatened by me. You are the perfect cuddler. You give amazing backrubs. You make me want to learn and improve myself. You appreciate my quirks...or at least you don't complain about them. You clean my room. You are incredibly sexy, and smart, and loving, and...and...  Happy Valentine's, love.

       Just to get it stuck in everyone's heads...   I'm so SPOILED!!  *inhale*  o/~Prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and GARLIC GARLIC! Prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and prawns and GARLIC GARLIC! Ohhh, it's steak...oh, a steak...it's a steak...o/~  Etc.  :)  Valentine's is coming early for me this year.  Currently I am wearing  urlLink this  except it's in pleather and a gorgeous pair of silver Celtic knot earings and a matching necklace, all of which I received today from Candyman, while my wonderful amazing boyfriend is cooking the above.  With garlic bread.  And new potatoes.  We'll be eating with Candyman's sister and one of our friends tonight.  Roxxor.  If you don't hear from me in the next 48 hours, it's because I either ate so much that I'm in a coma for the next several days or I'm busy saying thank you for a fabulous day.  I'm working tomorrow, so we aren't going to be doing Valentine-y stuff (as far as I know), except I'll be giving him his stuff.  And yes, I was singing that song on the way out from Costco.  In my new top.  It's been a very good day.  And we'll be watching the hockey game at home tonight, cuddled up on the sofa...it will be getting even better.

       Yesterday...  I was having such a bad day at work yesterday.  I was supposed to be at work at 330, but I thought it was supposed to be 430, so I wound up being almost 20 minutes late... (they called me..  whoops)  Some other stuff happened too...my supervisor told me that she was going to be calling me that night to talk to me about something that "wasn't too bad" and "involved some other people" from work.  Hmm.  Thanks.  No stress or pressure there.  :p  Then of course, there were the evil customers that always seem to come out when you're doing poorly...it's like they smell blood or something.  So I called Candyman on my break and was hoping to be comforted.  I did get somewhat comforted, but then took offense at a rather innocuous thing that he said, so I started crying and broke off the phone call.  I spent the rest of my break sobbing in the lunch room.  :/   That really sucked.  So, I decided not to take on this "bad stuff" for myself and went out there with a big smile and gritted teeth and a "hell with you" attitude to take on the customers.  About two hours later, around two hours to the end of my shift, I looked up to see Justy and Candyman standing there!  Apparently they'd been talking on ICQ and CM had told Justy that I was feeling like crap, so they came down to cheer me up!  Thanks guys.  :)  They stuck around for a bit and then they left and "went to the mall. *wink wink*"  (yeah, I'm not sure what that was all about either...they were denying that they did anything other than walk around the mall and discuss pool cues.  I'm suspicious.  :)  )  We then went to Boston Pizza, (my choice, their treat) and I had a really really good meal.  It was feta shrimp penne baked with mozzarella cheese in alfredo sauce.  I finished it off tonight and it was still phenomenal.  Justy had to motor after that, so CM and I went back to my place, and I got a two hour back rub.  I was soooo relaxed.  I could barely get up the stairs to let Candyman out.  I was asleep before midnight.  So, all in all it was a really great day after all.

       Whoops.  Looking back at the last two posts...they're a LOT nastier sounding then I intended.  Hrm.  I don't really know what else to say.  :(  I really didn't mean them to sound like that.  That's the problem with writing stuff down...there's no tone of voice.  So, I'm sorry.

       You know what?  Screw this.  I'm going back to Oasis.  I like it, so whoever doesn't can just keep their mouths shut when I use it.  Deal with it.

       Coma of a "legend"  Well, I've finally bowed to the pressure and become "Karin" rather than "Oasis" on here.  This is mostly due to pressure from certain quarters who can be real pains in the butts.  I'll still be Oasis on some comments, but I'll be gradually phasing it out.  *sigh*  Personally, *I've* always liked the name, so I'm only doing this to please others.  Which kind of stinks, but seeing as the name isn't something I particularly care about, it's a small sacrifice.  Besides...this way I will be in the right for a looong time.  ;)  I'll be bringing this up forever.  :)

       Fear...  Candyman wants to "play around with trying some stuff" while I'm at work.  So he's now admin on this blog.  I haven't done this for anyone before...I hope it works out.  This is like...a drawer.  (Alias reference...)

       24  Just finished watching the second season of 24 with CM.  Despite feeling really sick and dizzy the last half of the episode, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  :)  So, what's next for our intrepid hero, Jack Bauer?   (slight spoiler ahead...)                                 Well, with any luck the bitch goddesses Sherri and Carrie (huh...never made that rhyme connection before) and stupid girl of the year Kim will die.   That'd be nice.  Actually...I'd be satisfied if Kim got sent to boarding school or something...or got replaced by another brainy person.  I can't see how anyone that dumb managed to not cut her throat while shaving her legs.  *grumble*  The actress is totally hot though.

       Hmmm...  I've decided that instead of "I'm still living in my parents' house" I'm "renting the suite in my parents' basement".  It sounds so much better that way.  Since CM and I cleaned it up a bit, it's actually a pretty skookum place.  All it needs is some sprucing up...hence the trip to Rona that Justy and I will be making as soon as he's ready.  I need paint chips.  There are many amazing renovations I can do to that place...if I stay longer than a year.  This decision will be based on a conversation I'll be having with my mother at some point this week.  The basis of it is as follows ranging from "don't really care" to "deal breaker"...  1)  Don't wake me up in the morning to ask me if I'm working.  I don't tell you my schedule for that exact reason. 2)  Lock on my door. 3)  Either your stuff out of my fridge, or your fridge out of my room. 4)  Boys can sleep over.  No dirty looks...I'll keep them out of the upper floors until afternoon for plausible deniability.

       Sluggy Quiz!        urlLink Which Sluggy Freelance Character Are  You ?      Ok, I didn't actually get Oasis...but she's who I named myself after, so I decided to post her instead of Riff...which is who I actually am, apparently.  Probably because I'm tired.  I'd be Kiki if I had more energy and didn't feel dizzy and sick to my stomach and exhausted.  Ooh, hey, I ought to go to bed.  There's a thought.

       Movie Review    urlLink The Lady and the Highwayman   When you describe a movie, it probably isn't really a good thing if the description includes the following lines: "It would make a great MST3K spoof." "It's good in kind of a... urlLink Krull ...kind of way." "Well, at least the castles were cool." "Hugh Grant is in tights." "Hugh Grant is in tights...and a mullet." "I'm glad I was drinking Bailey's because it killed some of the pain." "There was sword fighting.  It was BAD sword fighting, but there was indeed sword fighting."  It was kind of funny though.   urlLink Hugh Grant  and  urlLink Lysette Anthony  are the only two names I recognized...and they play exactly the same characters I've seen them play at other times.  Hugh-man is the same smarmy upper class Brit that he always seems to be, and Lysette is the same ditzy blonde, needs-to-be-rescued-OH-save-me chiqua that she was in Krull.  She's got better hair in Krull though.  And I liked her as the Lucy in "Dracula: Dead and Loving It".  But Lysette, honey...fire your agent, baby.  Don't be cast in anything called "Evil Beneath Loch Ness" or "Trilogy of Terror II".  You KNOW that sequels are never gonna be as good as the first one.

       Oogh.  Got an extra couple hours at work tonight...one of the other supervisors is pregnant and she was having contractions, so she went to the hospital.  I was supposed to go out with Meesh tonight, but I'm just pasted.   I'm not working tomorrow so we'll be heading down to the States for a couple hours in the evening.  Tonight  I plan to curl up with someone/something and watch a movie and eat popcorn.  If C/M comes over I'll cuddle up with him, otherwise it'll be in a fuzzy blanket that he gave me for Christmas.  And hot chocolate.  Oh yes, there will be hot chocolate.

       Hurray!  Got to play a game of Ultimate today.  God, I missed it.  :)  I'm playing on a winter hat team, so we all got our names pulled out of a hat and that's the team we play.  :)  We lost our first game 13-10, but we came back from a 12-6 deficit, so we aren't too bad.  :)  I had to leave early because of a massive brunch that my family had.  We went to the Executive Inn in Coquitlam.  There was a huge buffet there.  Wow.  That's all I can say.  Wow.  My aunt and uncle are in from Calgary, so we got to visit with them.  They own a rocking pet store out there.  It's bigger than a Petcetera is.  :)  Many fish.  Many tanks.  I'll post a link later.

       Whoa.  Please to be noticing the room cleaning "x square meters unliveable" on the side bar.  I'll wait.  ...  ...  Got that?  Isn't it great?  That's the lowest it's been in almost a year!  Candyman came over last night and we spent over three hours cleaning...he organized stuff so it was all stacked and I sorted through boxes.  I can walk from one end of my room to the other without tripping, slipping, breaking, kicking, or otherwise injuring myself or my stuff.  I'm all impressed.  A really great benefit...the burning desire to move out has faded slightly.  We were talking about all the wonderful amazing things I could do with the place, and I'm thinking "Wow.  I'd never be able to pay the rent I'm paying here on a place like this."  I think I need to write out a list of demands for my parents and then maybe I'll stick around for a while.  Hee hee.  I'm getting giddy again.  I was very giddy last night looking around my room.  :)  *happy*!!

       Friday Five   1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done?   What I consider daring, many people wouldn't.  Some people would find the fact that I've worked in adult bookstore daring.  Me, not so much. I'v done some stuff that I can't relate on a PG13 blog.  ;)  Email me for details...  ;)  I think that telling C/M that I was in love with him was a pretty damned big risk for me.   2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?  Being a stripper.   3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)  Depends on your definition.  I'll be taking a big risk if I wear that skirt I'm making out in public...If i do, I'll be bringing a change of clothes...just in case it falls apart.   4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?  I'm going out with Candyman right now.  I took a chance on a part time/temporary job and am winding up with my dream job.   5. ... and what's the worst?  Can't think of anything.  I think that there are very few things that I will wish I'd never taken that risk.  Life's too short and most consequences are not far reaching.  Anything that shortens my life or screws it up (ie: having a kid too young) is the only thing I can think of that will be terrible.  Most mistakes can be overcome in time.

       Well, THAT was quick.  Every ounce of joy I was getting from sewing has been sucked out of me.  It just seems so...frivolous.  And...unattainable.  At least what I was wanting to do.  In fact, I can't seem to get excited about any of my craft things...or other hobbies.  Or even writing here.  It just seems so useless and an exercise in the illusion of my own self importance.  A pretentiousness.  I'm sure I'll be better later, but I just wanted to time stamp this:  Currently, I am not looking forward to anything.  At all.  A thought which quite frightens me, as I'm generally an upbeat individual who gets excited about way too many things at once.

       I have a new project!  Y'know, because I don't have enough projects.  :p  It's kind of a secret right now, but it involves a sewing machine.  I've always hated sewing and the last time I touched a sewing maching, other than to help move my mom's, was in grade eight.  That would be roughly 12 years ago...half my lifetime.  Justy has done more recent sewing then I have.  BUT!  Today I sewed.  I created a scrunchie.   It is ragged.  It has visible threads.  But, it is recognizably a scrunchie.  And it is teal.  I'm currently wearing it, and have been for the last twenty five minutes or so.  As of yet, it is still in a recognizably "scrunchie"-like status.  This pleases and impresses me.  Sewing is one of those things that people have tried to teach me over and over again but I simply have a massive mental block.  Kind of like the rules for "Big Two".  I can't seem to keep them in my head.  I've wanted to learn how to sew for the last little while, mostly because I love medieval style outfits and they're very expensive.  :p  So yeah.  This was good.  Although I'm incredibly tired...I was up until about 0530 this morning revisiting my A&W meal from several hours before.  I don't like being sick.  I should go make a purple scrunchie with the other material I bought today.  Incidentally, if people want small amounts of pretty material, check out my craft store.  22"x18" pieces for $2.29  And it's nice stuff, too.

       Canadiana.  Ok.  I just told  urlLink Candyman  that I didn't feel like posting.  Well, now I have something to post.  I'm minoring in Canadian Studies..which to some people is like saying that I'm minoring in basket weaving, or underwater video gaming.  It's mostly because, well...it's something I'm interested in.  Bonus points because it's a teachable minor and I can use it to get into the teaching certificate program.   urlLink Justy  and I were talking about Canadian culture and what exactly that meant.  We both figure that some of the defining things of Canadian culture is "We're not American", hockey and beer.  Another is...  ...  Actually, that's pretty much it.  Hockey, beer, not American.  "Any you are truly Canadian if you base your memories around HOCKEY!  If you remember...where you were...that glorious day!  That memorable day...when...when...Alan Eagleton...went to prison!"  Paraphrased from Royal Canadian Air Farce.  The reason that we were talking about this was because I just finished reading one of my books for my CNS course...The Electrical Field...and I posed an interesting question to him.  Me:  So, I'd like to know...why does pretty much all "good" Canadian literature...well... Him:  Suck? Me:  EXACTLY!!  It's all stupidly depressing and irritating.  I just don't understand why it has to be so bad!  I enjoy his answer.  From what I remember in my current exhausted state, his reasoning went kind of like this.  Premise A)  We don't like be like Americans. Premise B)  Much popular American literature is good. Premise C)  Our popular literature must be different than American literature. Conclusion)  Our popular literature cannot be good.  This makes sense to me.  Of course, there are notable exceptions (mainly in the science fiction and fantasy fields) but I am unwilling to mention them right now because I'm tired and can't think of any, and it also allows for comments with people supplying me with their lists of good Canadian authors that I can read.  Please proceed with your recommendations.

       (W)e (O)wn the (O)ther (T)eam(!!)  6-1, baybeee!!  Go Canucks Go!!   urlLink Candyman  and I went to  urlLink Silver City  to watch the  urlLink Canucks  game against Phoenix.  It was probably the most fun game I'd ever seen played.  Note to self:  remember to take cough syrup before leaving the house next time.  :/  I was coughing like crazy through most of it, but DAYMN was it ever a great time.  I think I'm going to have very happy dreams about Geoff Sanderson blowing past all the defensemen tonight.  My God, can that guy skate.  He looks like he straps booster rockets onto his skates.  I think that the best part was how they didn't get a shot in until 12 minutes into the first period.  Or the fact that we got something like 40 shots on goal, and they got like...15.  Yeah.  We ownzed them.  Enough gloating though.  We're still a point behind Colorado since they won tonight as well.  >:(  Anyway.  I get to work in the morning.  :p  Cash shift, so I theoretically don't have to do supervisor stuff...but that never happens.  So yeah.  I go to bed now.

       Textbooks.  Can you tell it's been a couple months since I took any classes?  I'm all like...motivated.  And...excited...  I'd better not look back at all the whining and bitching I did about classes last fall.  :/  I've been searching the web for the last couple days for textbooks I need for next semester's classes.  I bought two today from  urlLink Chapters   and my mother had the Laurence one...wrong year, but I don't think that should be too much of an issue.  So, I've glanced briefly at both   urlLink Why I Hate Canadians  and  urlLink The Electrical Field .  I haven't started Margaret Laurence's  urlLink The Diviners  yet, but meh.  I'll get on it eventually.  It's not like I don't have time...the semester doesn't start until May. urlLink

       Baby showers and stuff.  Yesterday I went to my first baby shower for  urlLink someone of my age group .  No one that I've been close to has ever had a baby, so this is a first time thing for me.  It was very exciting.  :)  I was overwhelmed by the amount of people who were there!   urlLink Candyman  and I got there within an hour of the start of the party and the entire condo was filled with people.  I hope that if/when I have a baby I have that many people who care about us.  We couldn't stay long because we had another function to go to.  My mom's sixtieth birthday went really well.  When we were doing presents, she kept saying "This is crazy!! There's so much."  It's kind of nice to do that for her...we always  got  get outrageously spoiled on our birthdays so when someone else organizes it I feel that she sometimes get the short end.  However, I think that she did pretty well.  We went out for a nice dinner at a local pasta place and then came back to the house for cake, presents and moving my bed downstairs.  Oh, and  urlLink hockey .  Daymn.  What a good game that was.  I slept ok on my new bed.  I always have trouble sleeping in a new place, and a new bed is pretty much a completely different place.  But I made do.  I think it would have been better if I hadn't been sick.  It's a whole new perspective on my room.  I've been sleeping on a box spring and mattress for the last six or seven years, which was about a foot and a half tall.  Now suddenly I've got a frame, larger box spring and MUCH larger mattress.  It feels like it's about three feet tall now.  I think I like it.

Not to mention that I was absolutely exhausted from cleaning my room yesterday.  I'm getting a new bed (well, we're doing a big bed switch today...my mom's getting a new one, so the old one's going into my dad's room and I get my dad's.) and so I had to make sure that there was a place to move my bed out of and the new one in.  So while I was doing a horrendous amount of cleaning, my absolutely rocking boyfriend made my bathroom liveable.  Hurray!!

       Argh!  I'm starting to get very fscking irritated at my template.  If I knew more than I do about HTML, I'd make myself up my own template.  I'm so sick of having the sidebar be so wide.  I'm REALLY sick of having my "currently reading" stuff down at the bottom of the page for no reason that I can figure out!  I think it's time for bed.  I need to buy my mom a card and a present for her 60th birthday.  My mom is turning sixty.  Yikes.  Oh, I cleaned up stuff from around my bed.  Currently it's sitting on my bed.  This is because I'm getting a new bed and it's wider, so I need to have some room around it.  So, I had to clean up the pr0n.  Now I need to put it and the rest of the junk all away before I go to bed.  Dammit.  And I'm hungry and want to take a shower but I can't because my bathroom is still in a million pieces.  I have a wonderful loving boyfriend however, who offered to come over yesterday to do all the stuff that was needed to be done to make my bathroom useable again.  This includes (but wasn't limited to)...putting the shower curtain up, repainting the ceiling, touching up behind the toilet and door, taking all the tape off, putting a new toilet seat on, putting the corner shelf together and up, putting the medicine cabinet together and up and general cleanup.  This is all in addition to picking up all the supplies needed to get everything up.  I love my boy.  It just sucked because I couldn't take him up on it because I was too sick to deal with anyone.  :(  So I still don't have a bathroom.  And I didn't get to see him.  But I might still get to see him tonight or tomorrow.  Probably tomorrow.  I'm sleepy right now.

       the once and future king synapses  Someone did a search for the above phrase and made their way to here.  :)  Not only was it number four on yahoo.com's search engine, it was also number ten from a different section of the page.  *grin*  I was feeling much better last night after eating that soup...I am not feeling as good as I did last night, but I feel better than I did yesterday morning.  I made another batch of the soup...it's good stuff.  I'm also seriously considering not taking a honey chaser when I dose myself with Buckley's anymore...I'm starting to associate honey with Buckley's.  Blech.  Maybe I'll chase the Buckley's with  urlLink Nyquil .  I hope I'm better for Saturday.  I have  urlLink no name yet's  baby shower and my mom's birthday dinner.  I'm definitely not going to the baby shower if I'm sick.  I want  urlLink no name yet  to have the baby after labour...not because she coughed really hard and it popped it out.  :)  Besides...she's so good about not taking medicine while she's pregnant, and I'll be damned if I'm going to give this cold to someone who won't medicate it into oblivion.

       Feeling better?  Well, with any luck, this cold will rip its way through my body and leave as quickly as it came.  I'm feeling much more human since I took a shower this evening...partly due to the "icky" factor of not being able to take a shower, and probably partly due to the steam.  Daymn.  Did that ever feel good.  Drank down some more Buckley's, nursing a Neo-Citrine and am currently waiting for a pot of soup to heat up.  I used Justy's recipe that I suggested several ingredients for, many moons ago...   The Soup I Ate For Lunch, That I Feel Better For Having Eaten   One can Campbell's chicken noodle soup One can water, as per directions Three cloves garlic, chopped  (I used five, but only because my garlic was dessicated and I needed to peel down pretty far to get to the fresh stuff)  One pinch thyme Two 300g echinacea capsules  (Did not add, partly because I have none, and partly because Justy mentioned that the taste was kind of off and that might have been a factor.)   Mix in pot and heat. Consume. Enjoy garlicky taste. For hours. Brush teeth and/or consume entire pack of breath mints before going out in public.   (According to one of my books, chewing on parsley or...something I can't remember...helps sweeten breath.)    Now, I am off to check on my soup.  Mmm..  Soup.

       It tastes awful...but it works.  Ooohahhh!!!  Just downed teaspoon number two of  urlLink Buckley's cough syrup ...had another dose about two hours ago.  I have to be pretty much dying before I'll drink that crap...in fact, it's going to be the acid test for whether my kids are sick enough to stay home from school or not.  "Ok, you can stay home, but you're drinking a dose of Buckley's every two hours."  I'm just glad it didn't come back up like the stuff I took this morning.  :p  What is it with me and puking when I have a cold?  That never used to happen when I was a kid.  So, my head and legs are aching like crazy, I've got crap in my nose and lungs and I'm exhausted, but can't sleep or focus on reading or anything.  TV and computer screens make my headache worse.  :(  I'm in baaaaad shape ladies and gentlemen.

       Too true   urlLink An article about "stuff"  and how there's too much of it in most people's houses.  In other news:  I feel wrecked.  Completely, car in the ditch and frozen over wrecked.  (It's a metaphor...my car is fine.  My body is hellacious.)  That scratchy throat I had last night has mutated into a brutal head cold that is threatening to take over Vancouver.  In other other news:  I called my best friend today who I hadn't spoken to since Christmas.  Not because we're mad at each other or anything...we're just stupidly busy and life got in the way.  So that was nice, we're going to try and get together in the next little while.

       Oh yeah...  I'm in a much better mood now... urlLink Candyman  came over last night and by the junk food that we bought at 711 you'd think that one of us was pregnant... (two kinds of ice cream, taquitos, nachos with evil cheese and a Dr. Pepper slurpee [not for me.  blech.])  Rona is having a paint sale which ends today, so I'll be heading down to buy some paint before I go to work.  Plus, I need to buy gas.  I hate buying gas...it's so expensive.  :p

       Parenting skillz  (A conversation between my aunt and my mother when/just before I was born)  (knowing that my mother was all "go breastfeeding" and "woo, natural" [she grew up in the sixties...] ) My aunt:   So, when the baby starts crying, are you going to...you know...use a soother (pacifier...whatever) My mom: (totally deadpan)  Dipped in rum if I have to.  Now, I'm pretty sure that she never did that...with me.  My brother on the other hand was totally colicky, so there's a possibility there.  :)  Sidenote:  I got called in to work today from 1:30-9:30.  The supervisor who was supposed to work today slipped and fell in the shower doing something nasty to her back...and she's 7 1/2 months pregnant.  :/

       Working Girl...or not...  So here it is, 9:50 pm on Monday night and I am officially finished work for the week.  That's right.  I got 10 lousy hours this week and I'm finished.  The talent agency better come through with some work for me this week, that's all I got to say about that.  Huh.  I don't really have much else to say.  I'm seriously upset about some stuff (logged for my own benefit.) but don't really want to use this as an outlet for that.  Yeah.  Oh, I scraped wallpaper over at  urlLink no name yet's  place.  Someone kill me if I ever talk about how easy it would be to strip wallpaper from a place I'm planning on buying.  Or if I ever decide to use wallpaper, anywhere, even if I like it at the time.  After all, take ten years off your life...were you smart then?  So, will I still like that wallpaper in ten years?  Probably not.  (the same applies to tattoos, but that's off topic.)

       Ageism.   urlLink Candyman  writes about "coming of age".  The italics are his post, the stuff underneath is my comments and the bold is my extra comments.   I turned 19 many moons ago...almost 88 in fact. That said, not being a drinker at all, and since I tend not to really celebrate my birthday, but that's another issue. So I'm trying to figure out whether or not there's a suitable passing of the torch, coming of age, or whatever you want to call it. You know for celebrating when the boy becomes a man. So this is a request for suggestions. What is a suitable celebration for this once in a lifetime event?     I think that the usual response these days is "strippers and booze". It's kind of sad though...we really DON'T have any specific cultural "coming of age" for boys, or girls for that matter. I mean, I suppose that girls have their monthly event, but there's really nothing public or official about growing up. No more hunting your first buffalo, etc. Maybe that's one of the reasons why our society has so many childish adults...they don't have something milestone-ish to aspire to, and therefore they don't.  I think that one of the issues of not having a cultural milestone is the blurring of the lines between adulthood and childhood. As you mentioned in a previous post, maturity is somehow bestowed based on a number of days that you exist on the planet, and there's something inherently wrong about that. I know some thirty year olds who I wouldn't trust with a sharp stick, and I know several teenagers or young adults who I would trust to deliver a baby...given that they had some medical training. :)  Now, seeing as this comment is longer than your post...I'm going to transcribe it into my blog. :)   Incidentally, something that I really hate is ageism...you know...where someone who's five or more years older is all like "Oh, you're so young...you'll get over it." or some other variation of that.  I mean, sure you've got more experience time-wise than I do, but I've made some way better decisions than you did when you were my age, so looking back on your life I'm way farther ahead than you were at this time.  Don't tear down my accomplishments because you fracked up your life.  Ok, I'm done now.

       I want my bathroom back!!!  I have the fixture for the shower curtain in my kitchen, my shower is full of drying shelving unit, my sink has paintbrushes in it, my toilet's seat isn't on yet, I have paint in my hair and under my fingernails, and there's painters tape all over EVERYthing.  I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  It's almost over.  At least until I paint my living room.  :)

       Doh  I'm going back to Ikea either today or tomorrow.  I got scheduled for a lousy ten hours next week, so I can't afford my beautiful new medicine cabinet.  *cry*  I'll return it and then hopefully be able to buy it again next month or May, when I'm not paying as much rent.  Either that or find another, cheaper, just as beautiful medicine cabinet someplace else.  I'm also going to be calling the movie extras people today after I finish blogging.  Hopefully they'll have some work for me for next week.  However, the walls in my bathroom look specTACular.  The ceiling is a little dark though...I mixed up some lighter blue paint for my corner shelf unit and I think I'll do some sponge painting on the ceiling.  I'm NOT going to repaint the entire thing...it just about drove me to drink last time, trying to catch all the little speckles of white.  *shudder*  For the first time since I'd moved into the basement (when I was sixteen, so eight years ago...) I slept with a window open.  The smell of paint was so overpowering that I could barely breathe the first time that I walked in there after clearing out my lungs with a trip upstairs for food.  I need better ventilation in that place.  :p

       It feels MUCH later...  *cross my fingers*  I think I've finally finished painting my bathroom.  With any luck, this hatred of the colour will subside as the memories of painting the damned place and cleaning the paint off my face, hands, legs and hair fade away with time.  :)  Actually it's not that bad...but someone please shoot me if I ever even start talking about painting a ceiling ever again.  Thank you.  So I decided, after trailing the bottom of my flannel into the paint and streaking my legs blue for the third time, to work topless.  It's a very small room, and it gets very warm, very quickly.  I highly recommend painting in just underwear.  It makes the time go faster, and it's more likely to get you volunteers.  Unfortunately, I didn't mention that I'd be mostly naked when asking for volunteers tonight or else I probably wouldn't have been painting alone.  Heheh...  So, stuffs that I bought for the bathroom today.  Justy and I went to  urlLink Ikea , home of evil Swedish designers, and picked up a set of  urlLink bathroom supplies  (I don't even know what I'mgoing to use some of these for!),   urlLink a corner shelf , which I started painting a lighter blue than the rest of the room, and  urlLink a medicine cabinet .  WITH mirrors on both sides of the door.  Justy is da man for colours...at Ikea he was matching blues left and right from memory while I was busy fumbling around trying to match the remaining paint on my fingers from the previous night.  He's so getting dragged along with me to buy clothes next time.  (Muahaha!!  watch for a freaking out comment in the comments...)  Also, I found twenty dollars on the floor tonight.  It made me feel that I was doing the right thing for spending money.  ;)

       Happy St. Patrick's Day.  :p  I am sitting here in the midst of the worst set of cramps I've had in the last two years.  Ook.  Plus a migraine-like headache.  (never had a migraine before that I'm aware of...)  I've tried aromatherapy, sleeping, apple cider vinegar and honey in hot water (it actually tastes better than it sounds).  The only things left are the painkillers (which I've been trying to wean myself off of) and a Coke slurpee.  I can't get up the inclination to go to 7-11, so painkillers it is!  Hopefully that will help.  I've decided that since I'm just lying in bed being miserable, I might as well sit at my computer, try to eat something and be miserable that way.

I had a crappy day at work today and I'm very very tired.  Going out with C/M tonight and that should make it all better.  Actually, I'm typing this in his room right now, and it's already gotten much better.  (/mushy)

       Anned...adanen...anened   Addendum  ;)  I haven't looked at any comments yet on the previous post...I sort of ran out of time with this before I had to go to work.  I wanted to add that I'm trying to be less obsessed with weight and food, but I'm still trying to be active and athletic.  I'm just going to be using different measuring sticks...health and fitness rather than weight.  In the past I've gone without eating, or only drinking juice, or various other nastyness and so while I'll be working on trying to limit my pop and other junk intake, I will be eating healthily and exercising.  Ok, I'm done now.

       Reading a book   Or, "How to use variations of the word 'obsess' as many times in one post as possible"  Of course, this isn't unusual as most of the people who know me will realize.  In fact, usually I'm reading about eight books at once.  This book's a little different though.  It's  urlLink The Beauty Myth  by Naomi Wolf.  I'll be the first to admit that I can be a little obsessed with my looks.  This is shown less with an obsession with clothes and high fashion, but comes out more with occasional runs to the mall which involve bloating my makeup bag with "expensive crayons" which I will use obsessively for about three days, and then will vanish into the cupboard under my bathroom sink for a year or so.  This obsession also manifests itself in fixation about my weight.  I'm a fairly healthy weight...usually between 160 and 165 lbs, not bad considering that I'm around 5'8 or so.  This has never been enough for me.  Reading this book has taught me several things, as I jokingly pointed out to several people over the last several days.  One, men are in control of everything and the only reason that women have such an obsession with their appearance is because of a false need that men created in order to maintain that control.  Two, women are really dumb because we haven't figured this out yet.  Three, lipstick is the tool of the devil known as "fashion".  Tongue in cheek, but how much of that is real?  So, what have I really learned so far?  All I know is that I've learned enough to take down the "Current weight/Ideal weight" goal on my sidebar.  If being comfortable with myself enough to do that is all I take away from this book, it's worth the ten bucks I spent on it.

       Unmotivated  I have laundry to do.  I have fun things to do (a borrowed barcode scanner from  urlLink Candyman  to do some book cataloguing).  Instead, I'm sitting here playing  urlLink Crimson Room  which I got from  urlLink Donna  (finished it with only a minor bit of cheating...  :) ) and surfing websites for classes to speak Elven/Elvish (I'm not sure which is correct, so I'll leave it up to the forum of public opinion.)  That's pretty much it.  I'm sore from karate yesterday, although I'm very happy that I went.  I had a hellacious day at work.  I can't wait to be back out on the floor.  I'm almost hoping that I don't get many hours over the next couple weeks...I want to get back into doing background performing (aka "extras" work) for TV and movies.  I did five days of work for four productions last year.  It would be fun to get paid $10/hour to sit around, read and eat.   :)

       Ugh.  My tummy kind of hurts.  That's not anything unusual, but it's still annoying.  What is it about people who are totally oblivious to the fact that a store is closed?  We had someone come up to the cash register at 9:05 tonight, five minutes after the store was closed.  She didn't leave the store until 9:18 because she was dithering over which ribbons she wanted to buy, and whether or not she had enough money to buy them!  And she was using cash, so it wasn't like she didn't have the money right in front of her!  I was getting really irritated.  It wasn't as if it wasn't OBVIOUS that we were closed.  I did the "Attention *store name* customers, the time is now 8:45 (8:50 and 9:00) and we will be closing in 15 (ten and we are currently closed) minutes.  Please bring your final purchases to the front and we (read: me) will be happy to help you.  Thank you for shopping with *store name* and have a great evening." announcements over the PA, and even made a "The time is now 9:15 and the store is closed" announcement under the guise of "hey guys, is there anyone left in the store" while she was standing there.  ARGH!  The lights are off.  There are people sweeping.  The stuff from outside has been brought in.  The doors have been locked.  There have been announcements!  THE STORE IS CLOSED!  I did wear my MJs for a five hour shift this evening...they held up well.

       Linkies  Hokay.  So, for those who don't know what Mary Janes are, here's a  urlLink picture  of some.  Mine are slightly less shiny and have a more slender strap.  Everyone happy now?  :)

       "There's no place like home."  Oh, Auntie Em!!  I got myself some Mary Janes today.  :D  My mom bought them for me at  urlLink Payless Shoes  for back to school/work/Easter.  :)  I'm happy.  I now have hooker boots, Mary Janes and platforms.  Plus my standard fare of sneakers.  Now I have work shoes that I will wear to work.  Yeesss...that's right...only to "work"...not thinking of ANY naughty schoolgirl outfits with these... nooooooo...

       I went to the fights last night...  ...and a hockey game broke out.  What a joke last night.  I didn't watch much of the game, but what I did watch was brutal.   urlLink Todd Bertuzzi's hit on Steve Moore  was terrible and frightening.  Having taken a course on Canadian hockey and how complacent the fans and everyone are with the violence in it is not a good thing.  I'm not really feeling like making a big deal out of this...just wanted to make a note.

       School.  I decided a couple of days ago that I was going to go for my teaching certificate, partly as a way to stop having to pay rent on my suite.  :p  I was looking for a teachable minor that I could take, since every teacher in the world has an English degree and I need something that would give me a bit of an edge.  Since I'd taken many classes, but over a stupidly broad range of disciplines, I didn't really have enough credits in anything except history to make a difference.  And I'd still need to take at least a year to finish that minor.  So I happened to see "Canadian Studies" on the list of teachable courses and decided to look it up.  I knew I'd only taken two Canadian Studies courses, so I was prepared for a huge list of stuff I needed to do.  Turns out I only need to take four courses to get that minor.  The basis of a CNS degree (major or minor) is Canadian CONTENT courses, many of which I'd already taken as part of my previous potential teacher training.  This means that I'll have my minor by the end of December, hopefully meaning that I'll be able to get into the January teacher training and be fully certified by January 2006.  In other words, a mere 9 years after I started university I will be eligible to teach.  I signed up for my first two courses today.  Things are all falling into place.

       Yaaaaawn...  So I wake up this morning not having had enough sleep.  I feel myself getting a potential sore throat, and I stumble out of bed to get dressed and ready for work, trying to psych myself up for the eight hours of the job I hate that will be occuring today.  I arrive at work with a couple minutes to spare.  "Hi Karin, what are you doing here?  The other supervisor just showed up...aren't you closing?"  Wha?  Crap.  Check the schedule.  Huh.  Well...as it turns out, I'm not scheduled for today at all...as I'd know if I bothered to check my handy dandy schedule on the sidebar.  Heheh...whoops.  So I bought a couple things at work that I needed, did the same at the dollar store and came home.  Now suddenly I've got eight extra hours today.  Huh.  I have a huge list of things that I planned on getting done this weekend...I could start in on them now.  I have a huge list of things that I've been meaning to do for the last couple weeks...some fun stuff, some other stuff.  I've got some daily stuff that needs to be done.  It's like having a whole bonus day!!  Screw that.  I'm going back to bed.

       The Cheat is now officially certified VirusFree(tm)  I was bad.  I was expecting some pictures from a friend and opened up the Bagel virus on The Cheat.  Whoops.  I'm so used to running a Mac without much need for virus protection.

       Of work and school  I got called into the office yesterday in regards to a very messy front end yesterday afternoon.  I didn't think that it was completely my fault.  In fact, I don't feel that a lot of what I get blamed for at work is actually my fault.  I really don't think I'm cut out for this whole supervisor thing.  The managers who were talking to me were quite nice about the whole thing...suggesting that it was a sign of maturity to decide that I would have more strengths in other areas, like working with customers.  It's really a huge burden off my mind...I've been slowly hating this job and it's so much nicer to be out with customers on the floor, helping them with their purchases, rather than dealing with returns and bitchy people and nasty co-workers.  This way at least, I can pretend to be busy and avoid the front end and all those poisonous people that show up there.  Also, I've decided to go back to school next semester.  Supervising is something that I'm just not really cut out for, and with school being back in session, it's one less stress that I have to deal with.  I haven't really talked to many people about this besides my parents and Candyman.  I didn't really give C/M a chance to offer any advice...  ;)  but my parents think that it would be a good idea to go back to doing what I love.  I really hated not loving what I was doing.  Now's my chance to change that.

       I've been listening to this WAY too much  The original can be found  urlLink here .   Hokay.  So here's ma body...chillin'.  Daymn.  That is a sweet body you might say.  RAWNG!  All right.  Ruling out collapsing in the karate dojo, discs becoming crashed into me, my overall fitness leaving and my ankle exploding, I am definitely going to blow maself up with junkfood.  HOKAY!  So basically we got my shoulder, neck, back, ankle, hip, jaw, wrist, butt, stomach and arm.  With injury.  I got about about twenty six hundred more than anybody else.  Whatever.    Anyway, one day I decide that these various injuries and fat deposits are going down.  So I launch an exercise attack.  And those fat deposits are like "Sugar! Sugar!  Who the fudge is shooting at us?"   Ok, so what does all this mean?  It means that yesterday I started a (healthy and sane!!) diet and I'm starting an exercise program to help me get into shape for the Ultimate season in the summer.  That's all.  So I decided to write up this whole thing to put off the whole "going to the gym" or "going for a walk" thing.

       Working on goals...  ...is both harder and easier than I thought it would be.  When I created my list of daily goals, it helped bring into focus the parts of my life which I wanted to improve.  And, it turns out that I want to improve a wide range of things from body, mind and spirit.  This makes me happy.  I think I may have set the bar too high for myself at first though.  Knowing that I need to write for two hours, and knowing that I need to exercise for an hour makes me kind of overwhelmed, which doesn't let me get started.  Baby steps...baby steps...  Exercise today: 2 hours of Ultimate practice

       Things I learned today about babies.  Today and went to visit  urlLink No Name Yet and her brand new daughter, Drew .  And so I figured that I would write down some things that I learned.  I've taken care of babies before, but never any that are 12 days old (!!).  1)  Drew is very tiny. 2)  Tiny babies have HUGE SCREAMS when being changed. 3)  Babies smell really nice.  (Actually, I knew that, but I got reminded.) 4)  Drew is really very tiny. 5)  Babies can sleep through phones, game shows, dogs yapping and sneezes. 6)  New moms can also sleep through phones, game shows, dogs yapping and sneezes. 7)  SHE'S SO LITTLE!!  Every part is so tiny! 8)  Baby hiccups are really cute...at least for the first little while. 9)  When you're resting a sleeping infant on your stomach, they will jump when your stomach gurgles. 10)  My God, she's so little!

       I suck  Well, I got an hour of writing done this morning.  I guess that's ok considering that I worked for eight hours today.  Got another student.  :)  I'll be starting with him on Wednesday.  And I made a bunch of flower barrettes from silk flowers I bought at work.  They're pretty.  :)  Ok, that's it.  I'm going to bed.  I teach way too fricking early tomorrow.  Oh, and it's Kittens's birthday in two days.  I have part of her present already.  :)  This is good.  Maybe I'll take her out for dinner.

Does anyone else think that maybe pictures of a cat bath aren't exactly in the same league as pictures of "Gaza strife"?  Although, having never tried to give a cat a bath...maybe it IS in the same league.  Cats can give nasty scratches...

       BBQ  Going to Meesh's barbeque tonight.  While I check email and stuff, my amazing  urlLink boyfriend  is making me a chicken club sandwich.  :D  Me likes.  I dyed my hair this afternoon.  For some reason the last two times I've done that I've gone to  urlLink karate  that day...kind of a bad thing when one wears a white uniform and is getting chucked onto a pale yellow, absorbant floor.  :/  I can't really tell that I did it...I think it just refreshed the burgandy that it was before.  I'll have to look at it again tomorrow after my shower.  Two weeks ago I had the distinct honour of watching one of the brown belts in our class test for her black belt.  It was really amazing, especially watching some of the kata (pre-arranged routines of moves) that I know.  It was kind of like "Hey...I can do that one.  But...slower...and much much worse."  It goes to show how much can be accomplished when one sets their mind to it.  In that vein, I present to you my goals...  1) Daily exercise of one hour or more...1/2 hour of that to be karate. 2) Daily writing of two hours per day.  Blogging here doesn't count. 3) Daily affirmation that I can kick ass in whatever I choose. 4) Daily meditation of 15 minutes or so. 5) Daily spiritual communion.  (best way I can describe it.)  Wow.  Ok...I'm not going to have a lot of time for much other than these goals...  :/  Good thing I'm really excited about them.  And it actually does give me lots of time...I find that I can do 3-5 all at once.  And I'm counting essays and notes for school towards the writing.  Exercise today: 1 1/2 hours of karate

       Chemicals  Going to go ingest some chemicals (the Pill), stick some on my arm (hair dye allergy test) and swish some in my mouth (Crest Whitestrips...the peroxide doesn't want to stay on my teeth.  :p).  Ahhh...isn't it good that I eat organic fruits and vegetables?  Actually, I don't but it's funnier if I pretend for this instance that I do.  Incidentally, having never gotten my hair dyed professionally, do they do an allergy test?  Why is it so important that we do one?  I'd think that the stuff we get in the drug store is MUCH weaker than the stuff that hairdressers are allowed to use.  Anyone know?  I'd like to not need to worry about remembering to swab my arm with junk that will stain the sheets burgandy or orange.

       Workin'  Insert pithy saying about raining and pouring here.  I met my first student this morning...I'll be teaching him three mornings a week, then I'm meeting my second student tonight.  I need to do the whole "impress the parent" thing like crazy though.  Apparently our talk on the phone left her with the impression that I'm "childish".  Lovely.  I mean, I AM childish...just not while tutoring.  :p  So yeah.  I'll be leaving in about an hour...this is after working for six hours today and getting up early two days in a row.  I'm kind of tired.  Got my schedule for the craft store today.  Honestly, I was expecting to be let go because I told them I couldn't work any night shifts and I couldn't do Saturdays, but I wound up getting 30+ hours next week!  Gaahh!!  Not that I'm complaining...but I'm really surprised!  And I found $20 on the floor today.  That's the second time in a month.  :D  This pleases me.  Exercise yesterday: 2 hours of Ultimate practice and a 20 minute walk

The movie?  The Punisher.  Yeah...weird, I know.  I'm totally not joking about any of it either.  I really did cry.  :p  I must be PMS'ing or something.  But anyway.  Go see it.

       11 hours?  Fsck that.  Title refers to amount of hours I've been scheduled for this week.  I got twelve hours last week.  This can't go on...I've got bills.  So, I have a second job.  :)  I did tutoring last year for about two years, and took a break from it for a while.  Now, however I am "back in the fold" and have gotten two students.  Woo!  That's $25/hour and 20/half hour, three times a week each.  (I'm not sure if ANY of that makes sense.  :p)  In other news...I really should have checked my "gauge" (how many stitches to an inch of knitting) with No Name Yet's baby blanket (the major project that I alluded to a couple months ago...if anyone remembers...)  Suddenly this so-called "baby blanket" has expanded.  I didn't realize it until a couple days ago, but it's definitely more in the "grown-up blanket" category.  A small one, but a grown-up blanket none the less.  :)  It's getting close to being finished...ish...  :)  Exercise yesterday: 200 crunches

Jennifer Garner on Jay Leno talking about why she could never be a CIA operative in real life:  "You need to be able to keep secrets if you're in the CIA.  My little sister came over to visit me on Friday night to stay for the Easter weekend.  I was so excited about her getting her Easter basket.  I wanted her to wait until Sunday, but as soon as she came in the door I was like "Are you going to open your Easter basket now?"   If you're gonna be a CIA agent, you HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL EASTER!"

       Haircut-type post  Today I did my hair and put on makeup before I went over to Candyman's to watch TV with him.  Normally I'm not that type of person...I'll just comb my hair and stick barrettes in it, or now that it's long enough, tuck it into a ponytail.  Makeup?  Not a chance!  Not unless I was going out somewhere special, or I got bored while cleaning my room.  I think I'm going to revise my previous ban on makeup and hair products outside of shampoo and conditioner.  I looked totally hot tonight!  Go me!

       Uberproductive!  After spending most of yesterday and the day before lounging around playing free computer games, I finally overdosed yesterday.  Yay!!  I got some writing done yesterday...I've starting writing fiction again.   urlLink Candyman  has been super helpful with that...encouraging, helping me create writing exercises...etc.  A couple days ago he sent me a list of topics that I could write a short story on, less than ten pages, and I have about four pages done on it.  Also, last night he gave me a pad of paper, a pen, a topic and thirty minutes and I wrote (in LONGHAND) about two pages.  This is fun.  Today I've got a schedule of stuff that I'm working on in my room and I'm finally getting stuff cleaned up from when I had to pull my bathroom apart.  While my bathroom looks fabulous (I sometimes will wander in there to do something [brush my teeth etc.] and just stand there in awe for a few minutes) the rest of my room has all the clutter that the bathroom contained.  I am planning on organizing it at some point, but I have a fairly major sugar ant infestation that goes in waves...there hadn't been any for a couple days, but there were thirty or so in another spot then.  And today I found one on my bed while I was sorting clean laundry to put away.  Ugh.  I fed it to my Siamese fighting fish.  I'm getting rid of a bunch of underwear, socks and stockings.  Does anyone have any opinions about what I could do with them?  It's a big bulk of cloth that I'd prefer to not chuck in a landfill.  I'm thinking about trying to find an "adult ebay" and auction some of it off.  Anyone done that?  Is it worth it?  Exercise yesterday: walked about 3 km

Hmm...shutting the window.  What a great idea.  Now all I need to do is visit the Wizard and ask for some will power.  Unfortunately it'll turn out it's all inside me already.

To make things a little more pleasant for all of us, I'd like you to read and review these simple rules.  I'll be with you in just a moment.  1) Please bathe before going out in public.  While your cat may like the scent of urine clinging to your clothing, the rest of us humans do not find it nearly as comforting as your feline might.  2) Unfold the bills you hand me.  I do have to unfold them, and you only have to unfold one bill, whereas I have to unfold several hundred a day.  3) Please bring the items in your buggy or basket out of said buggy or basket.  In the case of the buggy, I am NOT going to lean over the counter to bring every item out of it.  And since you are only going to be going through one or two checkouts today YOU can take everything out of your basket.  I have over three hundred customers per day.  That is a lot of repetitive stress syndrome.  3b) You are allowed to help wrap up the 64 clay pots and 47 pieces of glassware.  Especially if there is a line.  4) Read the fine print on the coupon.  Yes, it says 1 per customer per day.  Yes, it is only between 8 am and 1pm on Friday.  No, I can't ring two through for you.  No, shouting at me is not going to make me want to help you.  5) I am not going to remember your postal code.  I don't care if it's the same one that the last person had, I get three hundred postal codes a day.  Also, in between your two postal codes I rang through all your items, told you that the coupon automatically deducts from the highest priced item, told you your total, answered and transferred the phone and counted out your change.  NO ONE'S SHORT TERM MEMORY HOLDS ALL THAT!  5a) Don't tell me that I'm "not as lucky as you" because I can't remember more than one postal code.  I can and do remember more than one postal code, but not one I've only heard once.  5b) Don't get snippy with me because you feel that I'm "invading your privacy" when I ask you for your postal code.  It's company policy and I do it so I don't get fired.  5c) Don't ask me why we're taking postal codes.  We have signs up all over saying that we're doing a postal code survey.  Read them.  They're big.  And red.  6) Don't get angry with me because something is on sale and therefore you can't use your coupon.  Read the signs.  They're there for a reason.  6b)  Don't get angry with me because something is not on sale and the sign is in the wrong place.  I am not responsible for every sign in a 3000 square foot store.  7) Don't call me by my first name unless you actually know me.  It confuses me because I think that I've forgotten who you are.  The name tag is so that you can complain or compliment to the manager, and so that the absent minded district manager can pretend to remember who we are.  8) Don't get pissy with me because I can't leave my cash register.  I'll gladly call someone over for you, or I can point you in any direction you'd like.  9) Wait on hold for more than 30 seconds.  Calling back doesn't make the person you're wanting to talk to free any faster.  10) Don't put coins or your card on the counter when I have my hand out reaching for it.  Some of us don't have nails to pick up that stuff.  Besides, you get upset with me when I put YOUR stuff on the counter.  10a) Don't get upset when I put your money or card back on the counter...especially when you're talking on your cell phone, or to someone else.   Thank you for following these simple rules of courtesy.  Thank you for shopping with us and have a great day.  Karin

       I have to be at work at WHAT time?!  I finished work at 945.  I need to be there at 0745 tomorrow.  Fsck.  To junk food, then to bed.  Much sleeping must ensue.  Oh, and I feel much better.  The nasty email didn't go through apparently.  :D  Happy.

       Anger is healthy, right?   This isn't really representative of my site...don't be scared off...  ;)  Over the last several months I have sometimes had occasion to be furious with people.  (Usually at work...)  Mindless rage where my mouth tastes like pennies, my fight or flight reflex kicks in giving me a knotted stomach and I actually feel slightly lightheaded.  This would be the kind of absolute crazed frustration and fury which I would come home and it would affect me several hours later, especially when I was trying to go to sleep, by invading my head with images of me stabbing someone through the temple.  Repeatedly.  With a big smile on my face.  I tend to not get this way often.  Thank goodness...I'm sure it's not really all that healthy, especially if I wind up acting on these impulses.  Hrm.  Yeah...probably not such a great idea.  Usually when I feel slighted or upset I just shrug it off or have a minor hissy fit, and then it's OVER.  Except recently I've been having these fantasies about doing serious bodily harm to people who have pissed me off...who have just acted stupidly for no particular reason, and should be immediately removed from the gene pool before they pee in it any further.  So last night/this morning I was feeling this way towards myself.  I haven't felt this way in several years.  I used to have medium sized issues about "stuff".  Self esteem stuff...cutting myself...but I was getting SO much better.  Hadn't even used myself for Exacto practice in...probably six years now.  Last night was bad.  I took offense at something someone said...and have you ever been completely pissed off at something...knowing that it's pretty irrational, but still feeling justified that you're angry...even though you aren't REALLY sure if you should be?  Yeah...that was me earlier.  So I fumed for a while, playing Yahoo Games, (until past 5 am) blogging a little, reading my blogroll.  Oh, and emailing what I remember to be a really nasty retort to the entire episode.  I finally went downstairs and tossed and turned until almost six while visions of unhealthy masochistic sharp objects danced through my head, along with the knowledge that seventeen steps from my bed was a bottle of vodka in the freezer and three steps to the left was an entire liquor cabinet filled with cream based girly drinks.  Enough to knock all these nasty thoughts out of my head for a couple hours and make me feel less guilty for flying off the handle and sending out nasty writing when it really wasn't justified.  I am pleased to report that I managed to avoid both alcoholic indulgences and various sharp objects.  Now I'm feeling better, and I would like to send out a public apology to the people who got splashed with my angst of last night.  This morning.  Whatever.  You may all return to your regularly scheduled happy, if very tired since I only got 5 hours of sleep, Karin.

       My dirty little secret   Sometimes, I really like to read romance novels.  This is less due to the dirty bits (although that was my main motivation when I was in junior high) and more to do with the inane, sappy endings.  Yup.  I admit it.  I'm sappy and romantic...at least when it comes to occasional escapist reading.  The thing that I like best about romance novels (and romantic movies...watching Breakfast at Tiffany's the other night brought this on) is that the movie/book always ends at one of the most sappy parts of a relationship.  The characters are at the point where they've overcome all the odds which conspired to keep them apart and they have chosen to remain together.  Get married, whatever.  The thing is, they don't continue on.  There is no "stealing the covers" scene unless it's cute and can be resolved.  The in-laws don't come in to visit.  They never mention hot water overuse, children being anything other than wonderful and supportive or insensitive little comments which are tossed out by both parties.  It all ends on a high note without mundanity (I know that's not a real word, but it's 4 am.)  The women are always beautiful, strong and swept off their feet.  The men are always kind, strong and sweep really well.  The book/movie ends with both parties getting what they wanted...each other.  And that's all that they need...until the morning after, which we never get to read about!  This is in no way a commentary on my relationship (so please don't be mad.  I'm not airing dirty laundry).  :)  It's just a frustration that I have with all that escapist fiction.  Several series of novels are very good in that they follow the exploits of multiple generations of families and so the reader gets to see that wow!  Things WEREN'T happily ever after forever.  This is good to realize.  It is healthy.  And it assists those of us who grew up on Disney and "happily ever after" that it doesn't work like that 24/7/365 (366 on leap years).  Hell if I can remember what those books are...One series is by Sara Douglass and it's called "Starman" or something.  I guess what I'm getting at is that those books are like those dreams that you have where it's an amazing dream.  It's so wonderful.  Everything is perfect...maybe you're in your favorite fantasy world, or your dream job or something...then you wake up.  Oh.  Crap.  Back to Mundania.  Reading these books is kind of like watching good porn...it's idealized fantasy and it makes your own world look so much less magical.  Hoo.  That was a mouthful.

       Ooh!  Good Schedule!  I just realized that I'm not working Wednesday or Thursday, which means that I get to watch the first two Canucks playoff games.  So...therefore I will need to bring my toque, jersey and shirt to C/M's house, plus my car flag...and maybe I'll even buy the gi-normous Canucks flag that we have at work.  (29.99 minus twelve dollars [40% coupon] plus tax...might be able to swing that now that I've returned the medicine chest.  [Da new vun is MUCH better.   /Svedish agsent.])  Exercise today: Um...I thought about walking.  Really did.  And I um...walked to the returns desk at Ikea.  Carrying something heavy.  Does any of that count?

       o/~ OCD and ADD, those are the letters that are right for me! o/~  Sometimes I really hate the internet.  It's a super time eater for me, and the fact that I have tendencies similar to those letters in the title makes it that much more difficult.  I have a really short attention span and lose interest in things easily, which is one of the reasons I started this blog in the first place.  I needed to have somewhere that I could easily write up my goals and get a good idea of what I was doing and how well I was doing.  However, this blog itself has turned into a time eater.  Not writing, really...since I don't update super frequently or with very long posts generally.  But, if I were to take all the time that I'd spent reading my blogroll (or obsessively going to all the blogs on it, even the ones that are really good about pinging) and/or comics, I would have at least another half hour in each day.  This could be better used on cleaning my room, cataloguing books, reading, doing coursework (next semester), trying to write a good Canadian novel...etc.  So, I'm going to Ikea to return my medicine cabinet so I have enough money for rent.  :p  What a pain.  I'll probably rebuy it in two months...but it's annoying.  Exercise today: Nothing yet.  I'll see about walking to work...I'm almost out of gas and money.

       Ugh  Worked today.  Got to deal with a brand new supervisor, which wasn't too bad.  The major issue that I have with the management at work is that twice now they've hired someone and within two or three shifts they've made them supervisors.  That's not even enough time to get used to the cash system, let alone trying to teach them all the supervisor stuff.  This girl didn't even get one shift before they stuck her into that position.  Personally I think this is a really good way to get people to quit.  And since management is whining about not having enough people (despite the fact that they've got several people on the payroll who haven't gotten hours in two weeks) this is not a very good way to do things.  So, how was YOUR day?  After work was good.  Walked with Justy a bit, then did a junk food run and watched "Breakfast at Tiffany's".  I love that movie.  :)  I see way too much of myself in Holly Golightly.  And my stomach is kind of sad now.  No more junk food runs!!  They make my stomach sad.  :(  Exercise today: walked around LaFarge Lake twice...I think that's about two km.

       Weekend to End Breast Cancer  I'd been thinking about doing  urlLink this fundraiser  for a while, but when I saw  urlLink Peechie  was doing it, I got a swift kick in the butt and figured that I ought to give it a try.  I'm going to be doing a bunch of walking over the next little while and see if my hips and knees and every other weak part of my body can keep up.  So, there isn't a full commitment yet, but I'm definitely leaning in the direction of "I'm gonna do this."  Look for a registration notice in the next week or so.  I should be getting a pamphlet and going to an orientation within that time and fully deciding.

       It's summer.  Ish.  The smell of suntan lotion, at least the kind that C/M wears, always brings the "summer" feeling to me.  The fact that today was absolutely gorgeous really helped as well.  I'm feeling a lot better than I did yesterday.  Good thing...I work tomorrow again.  Exercise today: 2 hours of Ultimate practice, 30 minutes (roughly 3 km) walking

       First Intermission   Current score:  Canucks 1, Edmonton 1  I was bad today.  I missed karate for the second time in two weeks.  This fscking flu is completely knocking me out.  I sometimes have to pause for breath coming up stairs, let alone going to karate for two hours.  It still pisses me off though.  I'll definitely be going to Ultimate practice tomorrow, but I don't know how much I'll be able to do.  Last night C/M and I went to see Hellboy with a friend of ours and when we went back down in the elevator to the parkade it was completely choked with smoke smell...there didn't seem to be any visible smoke.  I couldn't breathe and began coughing so hard I was gagging and retching.  This continued the entire ride back to C/M's house where I discovered that my stomach was in knots and completely cramped up.  I wound up finally falling asleep on C/M's couch where I stayed until 830 this morning.  I feel better now, but still pretty crappy.  :(

       Man, I feel like a woman...  This is my 400th post!  Woo!  So I'll do a quick rant about being female.  :)    Last month kind of sucked.  I ran out of a whole bunch of stuff all at once.  Here's a quick breakdown of the masses of crap I had to buy, mostly due to being female.  Pads, tampons, Midol and Advil=$39 Cramp perscription=$23 Birth control pills (three months worth)=$56 Hair dye control shampoo/conditioner=$9 Hair dye=$9 (discretionary purchase...I'm shouldn't be allowed to bitch about this one.  :) ) White sports bra=$27 Being a woman=priceless  (And trust me, my Visa truly thanks me for my time. :p )  I don't really notice the cost of all this junk when I buy one or two things at a time.  Jeepers.  Exercise today: running around plant stores

       Hmm..  Interesting development...today I found out about  urlLink karate's  stance on cross developing with different martial arts.  Basically, it's "check with sensei first" which I understand completely.  Unless someone mentions it to me on Saturday (not too likely...we're doing a big demonstration) I'll go to kickboxing next week, since I told them I'd be there, and then I'm going to drop it.  It very adversely affected my Ultimate this week (though that could have been partly due to the occasional torrential downpours) and there are many good points brought up against cross training with kickboxing.  Also, as  urlLink Candyman  points out, I don't exactly have a plethora of time these days.

       Oops.  Spoke too soon.  Last night, in terms of muscles, sucked ass.  Yesterday wasn't too bad, since I was standing and walking around at work most of the day, but as soon as I sat down in my car, all my muscles went "MUHHAHAHA!!! Now we freeze!" and *cachunk* there they went.  Ouch.  I'm still sore today, but not nearly as bad as yesterday.  :p  Well, Ultimate ought to loosen all those muscles up, especially since we'll be playing in the cold, and we'll probably be short a couple of girls.  *eeps!*  Ok, starting essay now.  Then going to the University to try and pick up information for teaching certificates, then to  urlLink NNY's  place to drool over the Drew as she drools on me.

       *tentative stretch*  Cool, I'm not in agony from kickboxing.  :)  This is all kind of random thoughts from early in the morning.  Please don't take it personally.  I just want to reiterate a few things about my diet... Number one, it is not an "I can't eat (carbs, protein, sugar, milk, etc.)" kind of diet.  It's more of an "I'm exercising like crazy, so I should be fueling my body with the correct amount and type of energy that I'm outputting".  Secondly, I've been feeling physically much better than I have in AGES, probably partly due to the fact that I'm not eating like crap all the time.  Thirdly, it has been pointed out to me that my feeling crappy is probably not due to eating sugar/caffiene/whatever.  To that I say that I probably shouldn't be eating junk and if I feel sick when I eat it, yay.  One more reason to not eat it, even if it's not the junk food's fault.  However, I'm noticing the pattern that when I eat certain things, I feel yucky.  Kind of like when I'm exhausted I feel yucky, or when I ride in cars with certain people who hit the brakes too fast because they're following too close to the car in front of them *cough dad cough*, or when I read in a car/bus/skytrain I know that makes me feel nauseated.  Therefore, I try to minimize doing what makes me feel bad.  In this case, it's kind of like getting stung with a bee.  Maybe it was the bee sting that caused an allergic reaction, or maybe it was the air you were breathing, or some random attack in your brain, but you can try to avoid bee stings and so you do.

       Ow.  Ouch.  Ooh...owie.  I'm having some trouble with this whole "typing" thing right now.  I was emailing back and forth with the Master of a local kickboxing school for the last day or two and I went down there to chat with him.  Tonight happened to be the time that the white belt class met, so I got to join in.  Oh.  My.  Goddess.  I hurt.  I hurt very much.  There was so much cardio stuff.  I have a two week free pass, so I'll be heading down there twice next week and once the week after.  I don't know if I'll be joining or not, but it was a great workout and an extremely fun experience.  This ought to counteract the sleeping I did this afternoon and let me actually fall asleep tonight.  With any luck I also sweated out the Coke that I drank this afternoon.  I had it and started feeling really crappy...I've been pretty much cutting refined sugar out of my diet for the last two weeks or so, minus the Coke slurpee that I had when I had cramps, and I didn't sleep that night either.  It has to be the sugar, because I've been drinking Diet Coke with no issues.  I don't drink coffee or tea, so I don't get caffiene from that either.  Now I go to the shower.  And to bed.  Exercise today: 1 hour of hard cardio kickboxing

       ARGH!  Has anyone else noticed how Blogspot hosted blogs are not working about a third of the time you surf to them?!  This is particularly problematic to those of us who use a Blogspot hosted blog and use it as their start page to get from their blogroll and back, then...I don't know...link to... say... comics?  Or something like that?  It's a little frustrating.

       People are fricking idiots.  Has anyone else heard of this  urlLink sex bracelet  fad?  What a bunch of morons people can be.  I did a google on it, and it shows up as a party game for adults.  Well, you know what?!  Adults play STRIP POKER with cards!  That means that CHILDREN SHOULD NOT PLAY SOLITARE, even on the computer because it will make them WANT TO TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF!  Holy fsck.  Seriously, I have trouble contemplating the sheer idiocy of people who think that their 9 year old child is planning to have sex based on the fact that s/he's wearing a bracelet.  [edit:  urlLink here's  another site with a bunch of comments on the bottom.]  On kind of a cool note, we have those at work...I think I'll pick some up for myself.  ;)  Y'know.  Since I'm an adult and all.

       So many things happened yesterday.  Yesterday should have been the day from hell, but it wasn't actually that bad.  I taught first thing in the morning, did the craft store, taught another two hours and then went to Vancouver to take a private lesson for karate.  I got moving at 0700 and wasn't finished until 2100.  All this was on less than two hours of sleep.  Ye gods.  I had twenty minutes in between my first teaching and going to the craft store and I was so fried that I stood in front of the telephone book with tears streaming down my face whimpering "I don't know what number to call" several times before my mother sent me to lie down until I had to leave.  Things could ONLY get better from there.  :)  They did.  :)  I had the supervisor that I really like at work...she insists on people taking their breaks, at the right time and for the right length and will only call you back if the situation is uber desperate.  Teaching went well.  I discovered this morning that I'm going to be getting more than $900 for the month.  Um...holy crap?  There goes my credit card debt.  *poof*  Here comes my savings account *cha-ching*  I am pleased.  My lesson yesterday went spectacularly well.  I could feel myself improving pretty much every three minutes.  I don't think I've EVER been this excited about learning something.  I'm really looking forward to today's dojo workout.  It's hard to describe.  I practiced a lot last week and this has really helped me to kick everything into a higher gear.  I'm pretty happy about that.  Last night I got to hang out with Candyman, Jeff and his lady friend.  I'm not going to go into much detail, but a really nice time was had by all, and I managed to behave myself while she was there.  So that's about it right now.  How was YOUR day?  Exercise yesterday: 1 hour karate lesson

       Addenendum  All is good.  CM came over so I could be angst-y to him in person rather than on the phone.  And the moral of the story is...don't leave stuff in the refridgerator.  Oh, wait.  That's wrong.  (for the one person who will get the reference...)  Nope, the moral is "don't take Karin lingerie shopping when she's angst-y or else nothing will get bought".  However, money doesn't need to be spent and the potential buyer still gets to see nekkidness. (An aside:  with all of the hits for "gragh" I've been getting, I wonder if nekkid and various other not real words will get hits as well... hmmm...)

       Oooh...  My head has been spinning for the last couple of days.  :(  I slept a LOT this weekend, which made me figure I was probably sick.  Turns out it's PROBABLY just allergies.  First time I've ever really had seasonal allergies, so I'm hoping that's all it is and it'll clear up in the next little while.  Waiting for CM to call me, so I'm sort of doing laundry and cleaning and stuff.    *ring ring*  After 20 minutes of me whining to him, I finally realized how pathetic I sounded and got off the phone.  *grumble*  Not doing anything with him today.  :(  We're both doing stuff.  *double grumble*  I want to go buy some stripper platform boots, but I'm currently broke-ish.  Gah.  Bringing in groceries.  :p

       What a car's for  Tomorrow Justy and I are going to do model rocket related stuff.  I'll have to get my launch box out of my car, where it has been since about July of last year.  This is why my car is a mess...it's a holding place for all my hobbies.  I've got about twenty pounds of soap which is ready to be made into bars and pretty coloured shapes; that's been in there since at least December.  I pulled out various articles of clothing...some of which had been in there since I BOUGHT the car, back in June.  Currently I'm wearing a pair of jeans I found in there that had been missing since Valentine's.  Exercise today: I was laaaazy.  And I enjoyed it.  Except for the whole "I think I'm getting sick" part.  :(

       Quarter-life Crisis  The words below are not mine...they came to me in an email...but I know some of you out there who are going through exactly what is articulated below.  I was...and I quit everything and went out to sort my shit out on the other side of the world.   What are YOU going to do about it....   They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with  the crowd and start realising that there are many things about yourself that  you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder  where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely  know where you are now.   You start realising that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends  that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognise is that they are realising that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.  You look at your job...and it is not even close to what you thought you  would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realising that you  are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and  find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realise that you  have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to  your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.  One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and  confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past  with dear life, but soon realise that the past is drifting further and  further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move  forward.  You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone  decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.  One nightstands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.   You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.  You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself...and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!  What you may not realise is that everyone reading this relates to it.  We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.   Send this to your twenty-something friends...maybe it will help someone feel like they aren't alone in their state of confusion...  "It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

       Skirts and Ravioli  I'm back in civilization.  It's so good to be someplace where we have cable, internet and a working DVD player.  :)  Yup, Meesh and I were really roughing it...our TV didn't have a remote control!  We went down and the border guards took our can of ravioli...luckily he was really nice about it, apologizing for the stupidity of it.  It had beef in it, so for those who are keeping abreast of the "mad cow" situation, that was some fallout.  Weird.  A good time was had by all.  Meesh and I built a fire and I toasted marshmallows; I think I still have some goo under my ring.  It still feels sticky.  Presumably nothing was left behind, the weather was gorgeous and I wanna go BAAAACK!!  We went into Bellingham for a bit and I picked up a really cute skirt and a shirt from Hot Topic.  We only got lost once each on the way there and back, but we made it.  I had to leave my skirt at the trailer because we were down less than 24 hours.  :(  That's about it for now.  Fun was had.  I'll be going back again, probably during the week again.  Keep an eye on the side schedule for times and if some people want to try and coordinate with me, we'll see what we can do.  Exercise yesterday: Tossed the disc around, short nature walk, stretching and run through my kata, 1 hour Ultimate  Exercise the day before: 45 minute walk down at the Ranch.

       Camping  I'm going down to the States for the night with Meesh; we should be back around 3 pm PST tomorrow afternoon, in time for me to get to Ultimate.  I woke up at 0823 this morning without the alarm...because I forgot to turn it on, and I was supposed to be teaching at 0745.  Eep.  And I don't have kid's phone number, so I'm kind of hooped.  Well, I'll see them and apologize Friday.  On the plus side, I made Rice Krispy squares, went for a walk and did some schoolwork, all before noon...not bad considering that normally I'm not awake until around noon...ish.  Closer to one on many days.  I want to go to the bookstore today for a couple hours, but I'm very tired.  I think I'll shower, pack for tonight and Ultimate tomorrow, eat something, then do some reading.  If I don't make it to the bookstore today I've got time on Friday.  Exercise today: 35 minute walk up and down hills with the maternal unit.

       Visiting  Today I got to see one of my best friends whom I haven't seen since before Christmas, unless you count two days ago when we accidentally ran into each other at the mall but we both had to get going and we were going to try to see a movie, but didn't get a chance to.  *gasp for breath*  So we hung out for a bit tonight and went for a long walk, which was quite a feat, since there's no flat parts where I live.  It was nice though.  We're going to try and get together once a week to do active stuff.  Exercise today: the below mentioned karate plus 45 minute walk up and down hills.

       Meh.  I should write a better review of Van Helsing.  Here it goes...  Overall, I found it to be a really terrific movie.  The opening sequence made it worth the price of admission (more so since I didn't pay, but even if I had, it would have been enough) and it just got better from there in.  The storyline seemed tight, the fight scenes were great, the costuming was phenomenal (I have a weakness for a woman in a corset, loose shirt and tight pants.  Very pirate...).  I found some of the CGI to be a little weak...there were some issues with the characters looking too...slippery, especially when there was wall climbing involved.  I had the same problem with Spiderman, a movie I love and own, so it's not really a big issue.  I enjoyed the way they treated Frankenstein's monster...it was very close to the way he is in the original book and very unlike the way he is portrayed in other movies.  The Brides were amazingly well done, and extremely hot.  Their costuming was just r0xx0r, and so were their br...brain power...yeah.  ;)  I didn't find Dracula to be sexy enough...I have a thing for vampires, so I like them to have serious sex appeal, but there was one scene where as  urlLink CM  puts it, he suddenly turns on the charm (and the Dom nature... :D ) and is suddenly much sexier.  Ooh.  I haven't mentioned Hugh Jackman at all yet, have I?  Well, I don't want to get in trouble, so I'll remove most of the vowels in a big secret code.  ;)  -h m- f-ck-ng De-ty.  N- sh-rt...n- sh-rt!  V-ry am-z-ngly s-xy!  Kiss-ng sc-ne w-s l-ke  "Sh- g-ts P--D f-r th-t!!"  N--d t- g-t m- s-m- h-t A-str-li-n ph-t-s.  dr-ol.  M-ch dr-ol-ng -nsu-s.  Ok.  I think that was good.  :)  Also, Kate Beckinsale has changed position with Nicole Kidman in my "all time favourite actresses" list.  It was funny...I could not remember Nicole Kidman's name last night, I was so knocked out by Kate's performance.  Candyman had to remind me...  :/  New favourite actress list- Jennifer Garner, Kate Beckinsale, Nicole Kidman  Exercise today: 1/2 hour karate

       Hmph.  *pout*  While there are certainly things more annoying, there is currently nothing which is more annoying than having really cool news and not having anyone home to hear it.  Well, it's a good thing I have a voice on the internet, isn't it?  :)  Everyone's always told me that I should work in a bookstore, or own a used bookstore or variations of the same theme.  So today I went to my current favourite used bookstore and the owner had roughly eighty bazillion boxes of books that people had brought in, so I offered to help him out.  :)  I'll be going in tomorrow for a couple of hours.  *happy*  Note to self: remember to bring allergy medication...there's about 38,000 books in that store, and probably a bit of dust.  Exercise today: 2 hours karate

       Yes!  Media!  My mom told me yesterday that my parents were going to buy me a printer to do school stuff with.  Woo!  So she and I were at Costco today and saw a printer.  And we bought it.  Well, she bought it.  :)  It's a  urlLink HP PSC 1350  if that means anything to anyone.  And if it doesn't, well there's the link for y'all.  It's nice.  Printer/scanner/copier with a spot to plug the memory card for a digital camera into it.  If I had a digital camera.  Actually, I have a memory card somewhere that's around.  I'll see if I can use it to get some of those photos off of it.

       Thoughtful post (!!)  As usual, on a night that I should be going to bed early, I decided to post.  Actually, it was more of an "I need to post" but in a good way.  I don't know how long this is going to be.  :)  The lyrics this evening are from Aerosmith's "Amazing".  Warning: strange internal workings are occurring in this one.   I kept the right ones out And let the wrong ones in  Had an angel of mercy to see me  Through all my sins  There were times in my life  When I was going insane  Trying to walk through the pain    Despite coming from a good, relatively stable home with no abuse or other domestic problems including drug and alcohol abuse, I have had many issues.  Maybe it's just that I'm too dramatic, or too naive, or something else that is simply a habit, or else it's something biological or chemical like depression, ADD, etc. ad nauseum.  Simply put there's not really any good ways to determine what it is.  Of course, there's also those who feel that these "biological or chemical" problems are simply lack of character or things that can easily be changed.  I'm not going to judge one way or another...I don't really have the research, and well...this isn't really about that.   I've been struggling for a long time to "fit in" or to at least appear to and forget about my general alienation from the rest of my friends, people who I know through work, school or other activities.  I felt that I was missing out on things.  I would do things to try and gain attention...nothing major... trying to be special in some way.  That was always the rub.  I always felt that I needed something to distinguish me from the crowd.  It didn't matter that people would tell me that I was special or that there was something different about me.  I needed lots of independent confirmation to boost my self esteem.  I'm sure I was truly a pain in the ass a lot of the time.  :p   When I lost my grip And I hit the floor  Yeah, I thought I could leave  But couldn't get out the door  I was so sick and tired  Of living a lie  I was wishing that I would die   I've definitely had death wishes before.  I used to cut myself, until I promised someone very special to me that I wouldn't.  Even though I'm not in touch with him anymore, I've kept my promise although it's been very difficult for me.  I don't think that there was ever a serious suicide attempt, but the pain used to release pressure for me.  In lieu of cutting myself, I used other methods to hurt myself.  Again, this sometimes made me feel that I was special in some way, that by doing this I was grounding myself in reality again.  I know that doesn't really make sense...sorry.  :(  Even recently, I would lie in bed hating myself and willing myself to die overnight.  Or I would drive really fast at night, tempting myself to just go over the railing.  It's difficult to try and get help for something like that.  Eating disorders are recognized, but vacuous death wishes seem to be less serious, especially when I looked at them.  They are not seen as immediately dangerous, which I suppose is technically true, but they are very damaging to a person's self esteem and the rest of their life.   It's amazing With the blink of an eye You finally see the light It's amazing When the moment arrives  That you know you'll be all right  It's amazing And I'm saying a prayer  For the desperate hearts tonight   So I don't know if I'm ever going to be completely "cured" of this, or even if I want to.  While it really and truly sucks to be in "the depths of despair" as Anne of Green Gables puts it, it is so absolutely fucking unbelieveably GOOD to be out of it.  It's like that moment in the "Wizard of Oz" where it goes from black and white to Technicolor.  Suddenly everything seems good.  Suddenly there is a purpose to life.   How high can you fly with broken wings?  Life's a journey, not a destination  And I just can't tell just what tomorrow will bring You have to learn to crawl  Before you learn to walk   So this is what I'm doing now.  I'm crawling, but I've got a journey in mind.  C/M once told me that I seem to believe that life is a spiritual journey.  I tend to agree with his assessment.  I'm starting to find...myself?  Inner peace?  The meaning of life?  I don't necessarily know if it's real, but it makes me happy, and if it makes me happy, it can't be that bad.  ;)  In other, lighter news: 1)  Today (May 6) is the two year anniversary of the day that  urlLink C/M ,  urlLink NNY  and myself met. 2)  Our first Ultimate game of the season was this evening.  Overall, we played quite well, winning both of our games.  Yours truly played the best I've ever felt that I've played before, scoring one point and making a spectacular 89 point landing out of bounds.  I'm especially happy about the way that I played because I'd felt earlier today that I was badly out of shape and was not impressed at all with the way I'd trained in the winter. 3)  Wendy's salads are REALLY good. 4)  Babies are really amazing and cool and I'll blog that another time, I'm sure.  :)  Exercise today: 2 hours of Ultimate

I'll get to learn if I can play Ultimate while asleep on my feet.  I'm wearing my snazzy new Gaia jersey.  I am da sexy.

       Purchases  I got an extra hundred dollars on my paycheque this week, so after paying off some of the stuff that I needed to for this time period I went to the mall.  :)  I actually was very restrained.  I bought a white sports bra that I have needed for some time, some white knee socks to go with my Mary Jane shoes (black strappy dress shoes with a slight heel and closed toes) and a cute tan skirt for $5.  All in all, I wound up spending less than fifty bucks, including lunch.  That's pretty good for me...I have had some serious spending issues in the recent past.  So, my only impulse purchase was the tan skirt, even though I hadn't planned on picking up the socks today.  White knee socks are at Sears for $4.99 if anyone's interested.  Exercise today: two hours of karate

       Hooray for Spiderman!  Woo!!  Got to watch The Bug spin some webs, any size and catch those thieves...just like flies!  :D  All in all, it was a really good movie.  I think I'm hooked on these movies which are based off comic books.  They come complete with a great background, plus they fill one of my favourite fetishes...guys in tights.  Actually, I'm joking...I really like people with amazing powers and doomed supernatural-type love.  Although tights and body suits definitely don't hurt.  Miaow.

       Battered and bruised  One of the many things that I have to deal with in my recreational activities is various bruises to different parts of my body.  Both karate and Ultimate tend to have stuff flying towards me at a rapid rate, and since I'm a klutz the object will usually hit me.  At any given time I will have at least one bruise, unless it's been an unusually quiet week.  Today I have a nice yellow bruise on my shoulder from karate.  It is the result of a command decision on my part.  We were doing shoulder rolls, something I've never quite gotten the hang of, and while I was upside down at one point I realized that I was either going to land very hard on my shoulder, or very hard on my head.  I figured that I could probably get away with a sore shoulder, whereas I would be likely to require my brain fairly soon after class...say, when driving home.  This particular bruise isn't really even all that noticeable to the casual observer, but it hurts like a sumbitch.  :p  Personally, I find bruises kind of attractive...depending on how one received them.  If I walked into a wall, a car or a coffee table (and I do all of these far more frequently than I'd like to admit) it's significantly less sexy than if I'd pushed my body to its limits and either taken one for the team (Ulti) or got to spar with a black belt.  A couple of days ago, I noticed some actual muscle definition in my arms and I've lost a bunch of inches in my waist.  :D  It's like my body suddenly has decided that it's going to show off the fact that I've been exercising for the last year.  :)  I'm pleased.  Exercise today: a little barbell lifting

       Election  So, it's looking like a Liberal minority with Conservatives, then NDP.  I can live with that, methinks.  And I voted, so I reserve the right to bitchingness for the next couple of years.  Now my patriotism will continue in the dress, skirt and halter top I will be sewing for myself out of several Canadian flags for Thursday.  :D  And Spiderman 2 is coming out on Wednesday.  I got my shift swapped around so that I can go.  Yay me!

       This is awesome.  I'd highly recommend looking through the site... urlLink this article  happened to be one of the first things I stumbled onto.  I love the idea of the Native American wedding down at the bottom!!  That's so beautiful.  Gahhhh...more marriage stuff.  :p  Justy and I watched the 1975 edition of  urlLink Zorro  this evening.  It was...well ...worth the $4.77 I spent on it.  Barely.  I think the best part was when Z-man was rolling barrels down a passageway, then to escape stuck himself into one and rolled himself past the guards.  That's money, baby.  :)  Exercise today: 20 minutes weight training

       I love summer but...  I really really really really hate shaving my legs.  >:(  But I like how they look and feel afterwards.  This mini-rant brought to you by the razorburn I'm currently enjoying on my right shin.  I looked into a gym near my house today.  The things that I would really like from a gym are, in no particular order:  1) POPAT training. 2) Heavy bags and other boxing equipment. 3) Many weight stations. 4) Many treadmills/bikes/stair climbers/rowing machines. 5) Both very early and very late hours.  24 hours would be ideal. 6) Within walking/biking distance from my place of residence (currently Port Moody/Coquitlam) 7) Adrian Paul/Duncan MacLeod to own it.  ;) 8) Personal trainers. 9) Pool 10) Frequent classes (yoga, self defense, weight training, running, circuit training etc.)  This one has 3, 4, 5, 6 and sometimes 8.  I've given up on 7, and until I live in Vancouver, I probably won't get 24 hour service.  I'm thinking about buying a 10 visit punch card for $60.  A month is $43, so if I go 7 times in a month it's worth getting a monthly thing.  I'm going to hold off for now, at least until I look around a bit more.  Does anyone go to any gyms that they would recommend?

       Self Esteem up?  Or down?  I think I might audition for Canadian Idol next time the auditions roll into town, just for the hell of it.  :)  I mean, I have to be better than SOME of those people, right?  Anyway, I've never actually watched the show, and I've watched one episode of American Idol so I have no idea what to expect or anything like that.  I'm trying to think of a song.  Anyone have any suggestions, stick 'em in the comments.  Exercise today: 2 hours karate

       I have trouble thinking of titles which actually mean anything to the body of the post, so I'm just going to make this the longest title that I've ever had on here, and it will be much longer than the post that I have planned.  Went and saw Chronicles of Riddick with C/M yesterday and I really enjoyed it.  :)  Organic tomato soup is in my microwave waiting for me, and I'm still annoyed that I had to spend all that money on my overdue fines.

       *sniffle*  I heard the song "Dust in the Wind" today at work just before I left.  It was the song used in a montage of "Aww, they were so happy together and loved each other so much, but then she died" clips during a recent TV show that C/M and I watched.  I didn't even LIKE the character who died, but it started making me all sad.  :( How pathetic is that?  :P  I feel this need to work out now.  My student is late again.  I was supposed to get him half an hour early today, so almost twenty minutes ago, then I'd be able to surprise C/M by getting to his house half an hour before he was expecting me.  How very annoying.

       Such a girly girl.  My best friend has asked me to be the Maid of Honour, henceforth to be referred to as the MOH, at her wedding in May.  :)  We'd decided a million years ago that we were going to be each other's MOHs and she's getting dragged to the altar first.  I hate organizing stuff like this, so luckily she's all over the whole thing.  I still have to arrange the shower and stuff like that.  Bleah.  But I guess I can deal with that.  I'm palming off any arrangements for my own wedding (in like... thirty years) on my own MOH.  Tee hee.  So imagine my shock when I look at the time and realize that I've been checking out bridal links and stuff like that for the last two hours...and enjoying myself.  The heat is definitely getting to me.  :)

       *pant, wheeze*  Yeesh.  It's still stupid hot.  I'm waiting for my student now, and saw something which amuses me on my way here.  There's this guy who has an asphalt driveway, at the end of which he has placed three ice cream buckets, presumably in order to prevent people from using his driveway to turn around in.  I thought at first that it was because the asphalt was fresh, but it's been more than a month and the ice cream buckets are there nearly every time I drive past.  The amusing thing is that his driveway isn't in a spot that ANYONE would want to turn around in, and so he replaces these buckets every time he drives in and out of his driveway.  Ok, that is all.  Exercise today: nothing yet

       Money-ish post.  I don't think I've ever really gotten the "idea" of libraries.  I blame the upbringing I received in a capitalist environment, where the concept of "mine" is fully ingrained by the time a kid is...oh, I dunno...two? (And it's only that old because that's the time that they can verbalize it.)  Once a book is in my house after I picked it up from an institution (not just borrowing it from a friend) I have this issue with returning it. Plus, I think I'm ADD, or OCD or INSANE or one of those other acronyms and so I have problems with due dates.  Anyway, I went up to school today (I don't do this often since I mostly do distance ed) to borrow some books from the university library.  Luckily, a couple of weeks ago I'd checked to see what my  usury  fines were since I knew there were some.  This meant that I got to have my stroke in private, rather than at the reference desk.  So after dropping my $141.00 (about ten books, each two or so weeks late, $1/day), there goes my MP3 player I was hoping to purchase.  :p  Tonight I got to officially babysit (getting paid, while the parents are out of the house) for the first time in ages.  It was adorable.  Two little girls aged almost 4 and 5 1/2  I love kids so much, 'specially when I get to give them back.  :)  They're really good kids and they've got a good foundation.  When I came in they were watching a copy of their dad's original animated Spiderman on VHS, and we played Duplo!  Which is like Lego, but bigger for little fingers.  I got to do the niftiest bedtime story ever...less because of my amazing story skills but because the 5 year old has a MagnaDraw type thing and I drew the story as we created it.  I felt totally like Mr. Rogers or Mr. Dressup.  Except female.  And not on TV.  And younger.  And...ok, well I guess I didn't really feel that much like them, except I got to draw my story!  And I'm all stoked about that.  :)  Here's the story synopsis.  Collaborative effort.  :)  (She decided that the horse was why the princess was sad.) The beautiful princess is sad because she lost her horse.  (sketch of princess and horse and trees) So she goes into the woods to find the horse, but finds an old witch instead.  (Oooh...witch in the trees.)  And the witch knows where the horse is, but to get the horse, the witch makes her kiss a frog! (closeup of the frog and princess...much "EWW!!" ensues from the little one.)  So the princess kisses the frog ("I know what happens!  He turns into a PRINCE!!")  And the frog turns into a prince and the old witch turns into a beautiful young witch because they were BOTH under a spell.  (There's the horse and the princess is feeding him a sugar cube)  And the princess got her horse back and they lived happily...well, you know the rest.  I'm feeling less "off".  I think I've traced most of the recent stuff back to the Highlander episode we watched the other day.  I'll blog about that another time methinks.   Exercise today: 1/4 "Crunch", some weightlifting with C/M, ten or so good pushups.  DAMN YOU PUSHUPS!!!

       Of Chick Flicks  I generally like to say that I dislike romantic comedies, or as  urlLink NNY  puts it, "The feel good movie(s) of the year."  It's not even so much that I dislike them, but I prefer other movies...to give you an idea of what I look for, the first thing I ask is "Do things blow up, and is the leading lady naked in it?"  However,  urlLink Candyman  has been working to expand my cinematic horizons with various DVDs that he's picked up over the years.  Generally, his instincts as to what I'd be interested in are pretty much bang on.  However, there have been times when I just don't like what most people would.  Not his fault...I just have a slightly abnormal "movie enjoyment" gene or something.   urlLink Grease  is a great example of that.  I really and truly did not like that movie at all.  Tonight was another example.  I'd heard so many great things about  urlLink When Harry Met Sally  and I was really disappointed.  There were definitely some good one liners, but that was about it.  I think the problem was that I really didn't like the characters and couldn't get past the first couple of minutes.  Meh.  Whatever.  Part of that was probably that I've really been "off" the last couple of weeks.  I've been kind of depressed, but not in a really active way.  More in a "I can't bring myself to do anything" apathetic kind of way.  It really sucks.  :p  Watched an episode of Highlander tonight with C/M, and part of the plot might have triggered all of this as well as the fact that I was trying to do pushups to learn how to do them properly.  I have a lot of problems with pushups.  I've never really had much upper body strength and I was getting really frustrated with my limitations, bringing myself to the brink of tears a couple of times.  I didn't go to karate Saturday.  I had several reasons: my knee hurt, I was sleeping and slept through the alarm, I felt a cold coming on...etc.  I feel really pathetic as well as angry with myself, and kind of a failure because of it.  I can't put the spilled milk back though, so it just means that I need to work really hard this week, training myself and trying to make up for missing the class.  Goals and priorities for this week...   Monday: 1) do 1 hour of exercise after tutoring in the morning and before going to the university to 2) pick up books to start working on papers. Tuesday: 1) work  2) work on paper Wednesday: 1) do 1 hour of exercise after tutoring in the morning and before 2) work Thursday: 1) work on papers before 2) Ultimate Friday: 1) do a little light exercise to stretch out after tutoring in the morning, 2) work on papers for a little while Saturday: 1) work on papers before 2) karate.  I need a structured exercise program as well.  Does anyone have any ideas?  I will be doing a 1/2 hour of karate for every section of exercise, I need to be running and I need to work on upper body strength.  I'm thinking mix it up ie: weight training and karate on every other day, then run and karate on the alternates.  And no, I won't push myself so far that I get injured.  If I actually make it through a full hour of exercise, I'll be fairly surprised.  :(   Exercise today: About 35 "good" pushups

I was at a really great party Friday night.  :)  Head over to  urlLink wellipsis  for a very apt description of it.  I'll wait.  Welcome back.  :)  Anyway, I've got to go head out to pick up my brother's bday present.  Later all.

       Woo!  Well, I finished that paper yesterday morning at 0500.  I'd like to throw a big thank you out, first to  urlLink Candyman  who came out above and beyond the call of boyfriend duty at 0100 to supply me with a Coke slurpee (the only thing that kills my stomach cramps) and Montery Jack Chicken Taquitos from 7-11, then stayed up until 0500 with me proofreading, and encouraging and making sure that I really understood what I was writing about until 0500.  This is the day after he finished his final...so he is done with school for the semester.  THEN!!!  After I finished and he made sure that I had all the pieces (which I actually didn't...but hey, it looked like the walls were bulging and I was seeing hallucinating spiders out of the corner of my eyes) he then drove it up to the university to hand it in so that I could get an extra hour of sleep before I had to get up to work at 930 for 10.  Thank you also to Jeff for your ideas for inclusion/exclusion.  I appreciate it and will be calling on you for my upcoming paper on staples theory.  :)  Soooooo...I got my first paper back.  :)  9/10.  That's an A.  *big huge grin*  I reread it when I got it mailed back to me, and I'm kind of going "I sort of remember writing that.  Damn...that's a brilliant point.  Where'd I get that from...no reference.  OH!  *I* came up with that!!"   Anyway, I'm taking this weekend mostly off from schoolwork.  I don't have any assignments due until July 16, and I'm not working this weekend, so I'm going to take a breather.  Monday, I'll be at the university starting my research.

I have a raging headache, impending cramps and I am so tired and hot that I just want to sink into the basement and sleep until tomorrow night.  I worked today and I have to work tomorrow, so despite the due time of 430, I lost two days that I should have been able to work on it.  I have NEVER just sat and looked at a blank screen like this before.  Never.  If anyone has any ideas...here's what I have.  This is a cry for help people!!

       Oooh.  Boooooks...  Has anyone ever ordered anything from the Amazon.ca Marketplace site?  There's a store there offering tons of books I want for a penny each.  So before I plunk down my $0.14 for the books I want, I need some questions answered.    1) They're coming from the States, so would I have to pay duty on the penny or on the suggested value of each book? 2) I think the shipping would be $6.50 or something per item.  That sound about right for anyone who's checked it out? 3) Will I have extra, weird charges?  That's all.  Thank you.  :)  (I mean...it's not like I've actually got the TIME to read.  :p)  Exercise today: At the track-9 laps (35 minutes) total.  1.5 miles timed=17 minutes walking/jogging

       Hoo...busy...  Played Ulti tonight.  I feel not too bad now.  I felt like death when I got home.  I was sore and freezing, but I feel like I played not-completely-lame.  Scored two points and we won both our games. All in all, it was pretty good.  Oh, except for the whole "we have three girls so there's no breaks" thing.  :)  But that's ok.  A couple more weeks of that and I'll look damned good in a bikini.  :)  I rewarded myself when I got home with hot chocolate and marshmallows, salt/vinegar chips and a hot bath.  Oh, and my knee and my previously sprained ankle are pretty much the only parts of my body which don't hurt.  Things are moving forward on the police thing.  I'm going to a meeting on Saturday for it and I've started training a little for the  urlLink POPAT .  Yup.  I've already had some requests from people who want to borrow my handcuffs when I get them...so I'll be starting a waiting list.  Bribes will be accepted.  (Gee, wonder if that's against regulations...  Nahh... ;) )  I teach tomorrow morning, so I'll quickly update my schedule and then crash like the exhausted chiqua that I am.  Exercise today: 2 1/2 hours of Ultimate

       Yay!  I tested my knee out a little this afternoon, and the results are as follows.  Zero pain.  Zero swelling.  I'm very out of shape however.  Please note the return of the exercise portion of the blog.  Exercise today: 15 minutes walking/running (about 1-2 km)

       Command decision  I woke up this morning around 0500, after finally falling asleep around 0300 with an upset stomach (both when I went to bed and when I woke up) so I tried to doze off again.  Finally I called in sick to work due to lack of sleep and excess of stomach acid, went to do my early morning teaching, came home and slept until 2.  I feel much better.  I will now work on my take home midterm after I finish eating, then teach, then do stuff with Meesh.  Then work on my midterm some more.  :p  Bleah.  School.

       Fun yesterday, fun the day before, not so fun today.  Day before yesterday (Monday) evening was fun.  C/M took me out for "date night".  :)  It started out with DQ ice cream, then off to the movies to catch "13 Going On 30" starring Jennifer Garner *siiiiiiigh*  :)  Much good.  Thank you sweetie!  This evening was a great dinner with Justy.  I'm not feeling really good right now, nothing to do with the food...more to do with the wild and crazy anime (Spirited Away) and bright flashing colours I think.  Bleah.  Anyway, I need to go to bed, tutoring tomorrow.

       Yipes.   A little overwhelmed, it's still good!  It's still good!  At the risk of sounding totally mushy, I'd like to send out a big kiss to my  urlLink boy .  He knows why.  :)  Quickie update:    My knee=happy.  I was tutoring the other day and bent over and heard a CRACKPOPSNAPCRUNCH.  I froze and just thought "Holy shit.  That sounded like it should have really hurt."  I flexed it several times experimentally and there was neither pain, stiffness or residual cracking.  This was Friday afternoon, and it is now back to normal except for being a little stiff when I first wake up.   urlLink My skirt =really fricking gorgeous.  I love it.  As well as my mesh top.  I went to the mall with Candyman today and it was funny to have people look weirdly at me.  I haven't worn strange-ish Goth-like clothing since high school/first year university and so that amuses me.  My hair=gorgeous.  Dark dark dark purple/black.  It will have very obviously purple streaks in it in the next couple days/a week.  School=eep.  I'm actually pretty well on track, but still feeling kind of freaked out about the whole thing.  I think I've got everything under control.  I've actually got some news though.  I'm planning on applying for a police department in the next couple of weeks.  LOL.  This also amuses me.  I've had most people I've told tell me that they can't picture me as a cop.  Well, I wanted to be a high school teacher so it's not really THAT much of a stretch?  Right?  Hello?  :)  Erm, yeah.

       Curiosity  So, who reads my blog?  Now that I've got comments back up, answer the following question in the comments...if you want to...I mean, don't feel like you need to, but I'm wondering who's out there.  When you change your template, or someone whose blog you read frequently changes their template do you get kind of confused?  Like when someone changes their voice mail message?

       Hokay.  Knee still hurts...but not as bad.  Comments are back up (hopefully.  :/).  I bought new shoes yesterday.  I dyed my hair yesterday.  I am almost finished my paper.  I'm having a good day.  Everything is spiralling out of control much slower than normal.  :)

I like my pretty new template.  :)  Thank you Blogger.  :)  My knee still hurts.  It's not swollen, so that's good.  Um...that's about it.  Now I eat, finish paper, install MS Office, dye my hair and sleep.

       The verdict is...  "You've definitely done something to yourself."  Um, thanks?  Glad I went to the doctor's...  My knee was worse this morning.  Tentative diagnosis is a strained or (hopefully not) a sprained side knee ligament.  (Not posterier or anterior...what's "right" in that context?)  Treatment involves staying off it, RICEing (Rest Ice Compression Elevation) it and an Advil four times daily to keep the swelling down, plus some quadracept exercises.  And no Ultimate or karate for at least a week.  Exercise today: Nothing dammit.  :(

       OW!  DAMMIT!  I screwed up my knee today.  >:(  I wasn't even doing anything fun, unless I was going out and playing Ultimate in my sleep last night.  It hurts and it's a little swollen, so I've been icing it and resting it.  I came home from work a couple hours early because I was really sore.  Hopefully it will be better for Thursday.  :(

       Answering Rhetorical Questions since 1979  Does a bear sh-t in the woods?  Well, I can't answer that, but I can say with great authority that a bear will sh-t on my driveway.  Lovely.  Tonight is the  urlLink User Friendly  meet at TGI-Friday's in Metrotown around 630.  I will be attending with my out of town friends who organized it.  Stop on by.  We went to the fireworks on Wednesday as well.  Bar none: the best fireworks display I've ever seen.  Plus, I've learned...Cotton candy: it's like crack, but BLUE!  Ulti last night was good.  We won our first game towards the playoffs.  :)  Go us!  Um...what else?  Oh, my last paper is handed in (thank you  urlLink Dave  for editing and handing it in) which means I have one final on Thursday (boo...have to miss Ulti.)  I get to see the Drew and  urlLink NNY  tomorrow!  Yayayayay!!  My student is finished his worksheet, so I must dash.  Ciao...See you all at Pride!

       Haaa...haaaaa....hot....  Ok, fine.  I'll actually talk about the bloody heat.  After a really nice cooling off day, it's back up to...21?!  It feels soooo much hotter.  Yeesh.  Maybe because I had a nap?  I tend to be warmer when I've just woken up.  Maybe it has something to do with blood flow.  Speaking of blood (segue much?) I'm donating blood today.  It's been a while.  I had my navel pierced two years ago which made me ineligible for a year, then I was either sick, working or maybe being called in to work every time for the next year.  So, here I go to the vampires...my appointment's at 2:50...let's see if I can drag anyone else along.  :D  Exercise today: blah.

       I am feeling so much better.  A couple good nights of good sleep will do that.  I'm still sore in various odd places...my right ankle is bothering me currently.  I think it got stiff after the drive to Bellevue.  It's the one I sprained a year and a bit ago, so it's not that surprising, I suppose.  Oh, incidentally, a/c doesn't work very well when you're sitting in a border lineup for over an hour and a half.  Yeesh!  I'm gonna go have a mini nap now.  Just finished tutoring and I'm at the craft store this afternoon, so I ought to chill for a bit.

       Ow! My everything!  Quick update from the weekend of scary sleep deprivation...please to be forgiving of random stream of consciousness.  Did Kata on the Beach with karate this morning.  Beautiful...wonderful...we need to do it more often.  Loved it.  :D  Very happy about fun.  Stuff.  :)  Bellevue today as well for Kit's wedding dress.  Much driving ensued.  I am so glad that I have air conditioning in my car, since we were stuck at the border for over an hour and a half.  It was fun though.  Got to hang out with Kit and her friend Lisa...nice person.  Yay for Outback Steakhouse!  Thanks Kit!!  Then there was more driving.  I hate driving in the States.  It's scary evil.  I am NOT going to the Ultimate Frisbee team barbeque right now.  I will sleep and make myself not sick by sleeping in tomorrow...although since I've been getting up around six for the last four days in a row (NOT because I wanted to!) I don't know if I'll be able to.  I will hopefully have a nice relaxing day tomorrow rereading my novels for my paper which is due on Friday.  FRIDAY?!  EEK!!  At least it's only 1000 words.  *glances at the size of the post*  Wow, for what was supposed to be a really short post, this is quite a few words.  Sleep happens....now.  zzzzzz.  Exercise today: 1.5 hours karate (kata on the beach)

Total pay=$99  :D ) 1630-Kit and I cleaned out my car 1900-Bourne Supremacy  I still have to iron my gi because I am getting up tomorrow morning to do a beach workout for karate (at 0600), then drive to Bellevue to pick up Kit's wedding dress.  Yeegah.  I think I must sleep.  Exercise today: ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!

       Emotions  I'm really not in a good place right now.  I'm too emotional over stupid little things and it's moving me around from anger to sadness to "I want to hurt myself" to "I want to hurt something or someone else" and all over the map.  I feel helpless and upset and I DON'T LIKE CRYING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE!  Or alone for that matter.  Yeah, it's been kind of a sucky day, with occasional good bits thrown in.  Good bits include: being told I was loved over and over, prawns/scallops and garlic, playing with the webcam and reconnecting with a friend.  Crappy bits: children at Ultimate, playing really badly and getting frustrated, being misunderstood, getting overly emotional about it all.  I'm feeling very psychically battered today...not like "I can read minds" battered like Deanna Troi, but just "I can't go on being in this place" smashed around.  I'm feeling...resigned...and since this is not a happy thing...resigned is not a good thing.  My chest hurts and I'm sniffling/semi-crying, my throat hurts and I feel as if I'm going to throw up.  Plus I get to wake up in six hours and deal with people.  All.  Day.  Long.  *cries*  Exercise today: 1 hour Ultimate

       Flu or food?  Something that I've been unable to figure out is the difference between a flu and food poisoning.  I know that food poisoning is supposed to last only one day, while flus (flues? flews?  :p ) last longer.  I'm thinking I have a flu of some description, since I've been feeling crappy for the last couple days, then everything kind of came to a head early (EARLY!) this morning...and I've felt like utter crap all day.  My throat is sore, my stomach muscles feel like someone's stapling them to my stomach wall and I've got a piercing headache that comes and goes.  Could someone please send me a body transplant?  Thanks.  We can start with the gut.  It's weird though...I've always had stomach problems...nausea whenever I get overtired, cramps with my period, stitches when I run, nausea for various random reasons I haven't quite figured out yet.  If the world is fair, if/when I have kids, my labour had better be amazingly easy...or else I'll be somewhat put out.  (this possible illness means I might not be going to visit NNY and Drew tomorrow...I'll call and let you know what's going on.)

       Rumour mongering   Or: the post that's probably going to get me in major trouble.  :)   DISCLAIMER: I'm just being a goof...don't mind me.  Today I took a nap, then handed in my paper.  Before going to the university, I called ahead to  urlLink Dave's  to see if I should stop by.  Turns out he's not home, busy taking a friend (female) to the doctor's office at about noon, but I can stop by when I'm finished.  This is about 2:00.  Ok, fair enough.  I dawdle a bit and head over after turning in the paper and arrive around 3:00.  It's now 4:00...no sign of Dave or female friend and I'm bored of knitting for the time being.  Hmmm... So now, it's time to postulate...soap opera style!  *thumbs up*  Is she pregnant?  Ooh!  Cool!!  Another baby in the circle of friends!  But wait!  Why isn't her husband going with her instead?  Why...because it's not his child!  So Dave's going because...ooh.  I don't like the way this one's going.  NEXT!  Hmmm...how about...they're actually an elite crime fighting team from CSIS and the whole doctor's thing is just a front...unless it's code for "We're going to go fight the evil Doctor of Ultimate DOOOOOM".  That's not fair!  I like costumes and beating people up!  I wanna be an elite crime fighting team member.  Ok...what else?  Maybe someone needs to be deprogrammed from a cult posing as a group of life insurance salesmen.  Or one of them is possessed by demons...posing as a cult...posing as a group of insurance salesmen!  Or perhaps they are out buying me a stupendous present, one which requires both of them to move.  OOH!!  A PONY!!!  YAY!!!  Perhaps the great Canadian novel is being written.  Or the great Canadian symphony.  Or the great Canadian beer recipe and hockey playbook.  Not saying that they're the ones doing it, but perhaps they are witness to the great genius unfolding.  What if they got mugged by overzealous circus clowns.  Or worse...MIMES!  Because you know, a mime is a terrible thing to waste.  (Don't kill me, it was from Robin Hood: Men in Tights)  It's possible that while driving, they ran into a protest over cruelty to banana slugs and joined in the march to Whistler.  That could take a while...I think there's an accident on the Sea to Sky highway.  Anyway, there's my list of interesting excuses and suggestions.

       Happy Birthday Random Synapses  Yes, we at Random Synapses have bringing people bloggity goodness for one year now.  Something I didn't realize is that I started karate the same day I started doing the blog...interesting...  This blog was originally for me to try and do goal-type stuff...let's see how I've been doing:  This was the first series of goals I set for myself.   Online:  blog three times a week  Financial::  Pay Candyman, get rid of my credit card bill  Physical I::  Weight down from 167 or so to 150 lbs  Physical II::  Exercise two or three times/week  Personal Space::  Clean my room.  Education::  Do some sort of readings on my own  Here are the first results   Online:  blogged many times so far.  Financial::  Um, I haven't opened my credit card bill yet. I'm kind of scared, and I need to buy a gi for karate...  Physical I::  165 lbs, baybeee! No junk food today either.  Physical II::  Went to karate tonight. Loving it.  Personal Space::  Roughly 350 square feet out of 400 are totally unlivable. The 50 feet equals my bed, some space beside it, my bathroom and a path to each place.  Education::  Currently reading "Power Herbs", and referencing other herbal and aromatherapy books. Tonight I will be researching blisters and how to cure them before my Monday night Ultimate Frisbee game.  Here are my current results   Online:  blogged many times so far.  :)  I've done over 460 posts in 366 days.  Financial::  Still owe  urlLink C/M  some money, but not nearly as much.  Credit card is paid off (over $600) and I have a small savings.  Physical I::  about 162 lbs.  However, I've gone down two sizes in jeans.  Physical II::  I've been running, doing karate, doing Ultimate...I'm awesome.  Personal Space::  Hm...I think it's at about 150 square feet clean.  I started crafting again this year, so that's a lot of stuff taking up a lot of space!  (Damn you, clearance yarn!  I will defeat you!!)  Education::  I've taken seven classes in the last year, plus done a bunch of research into starting my own business, herbal remedies, aromatherapy, Wicca and fitness.  Overall, I'm pretty happy about how things have gone.  It's been just over two years with  urlLink Candyman  now.  Y'know, I think it's time I started calling him  urlLink Dave .  Y'know.  Since that's his name and all.  :)  (Post actually written at 9:23 PM July 17)

Thank you to my lovely guy who came over to edit it, encourage me, and then distract me when I was finished so that I didn't beat my brains out over it.  I'll be taking it up to the university in a half hour or so.  :)

       Bear Scare  Holy crap.  There's been a bear around our street for the last couple of weeks and there's been another sighting.  What is WITH the wildlife the last couple days?  Bit of a water shortage or something?  So far there's been a rabbit (we needn't get into THAT) (I didn't even know that we had rabbits in this area.), a raccoon this morning, the bear, an eagle at Ulti last night and my brother saw a pair of deer.  Yeesh.  Incidentally, *whine* I wanna be downtown with the boys right now.  :(  I think I should go to bed, get up early and work on my paper with a fresh brain.  I'll bring my books with me so that I can shift gears into talking about staple economies (not office depot, hyuck..) rather than Canadian culture.  I'm having issues.  I also need to stop reading mommyblogs.   urlLink I think I felt my uterus go *TWINGE*.   (Read the next five as well...it gets funnier.)  Twinging is not a good way to stay focused on papers.  Now, no one who reads this is allowed to panic.  (I would say "you know who you are" but I'm not. :p Besides, there's a couple of you.)  I'll be better in a little while.  Weather is warm and sunny with occasional babycravings.  It's all good.  Hmmm...just a thought.  Maybe if I didn't blog so much...or read so many blogs...or webcomics...I might be able to join the guys when they get to go do fun things.  Crazy thoughts.  Exercise today: Just my brain.

       YEEARGH!!!!  One more FREAKING quote to find...out of a mere THREE books that it could be in...and I'm SURE it's at the front of a chapter or essay...AND I CAN'T FIND IT! As soon as I find it, my paper is finished. WHERE THE HELL IS IT?!   *breathes again* Yup. Ok...it's definitely too hot in here.  ***UPDATE*** 1:58 pm.  Hmph.  Fine.  I can't find it, so I'm just changing around what I'm backing up in my conclusion.  Just finishing off my bibliography.  Now, barring my computer exploding and catching everything around it on fire, my paper is finished.  ...  ...  Um...I'm going to move my paper away from my computer.  You know...just in case.

       Time zones  It's sometimes lousy to be in the Wet coast time zone, especially when you get woken up at 0600 by Toronto people who think the time is the same all over the world, or when you realize at 2 pm that you need to call a bank...but head office is in Ontario, so they're already closed.  However, sometimes  urlLink it's a good thing,  because you can get your news just that much faster.  This feels weird.  Usually I don't talk about stuff in the news.  I think the election was one of those few things.  Huh.  Well, back to the paper.  Speaking of which...where's all those brilliant ideas from everyone?  :)

       :(  I hit a rabbit on the Lougheed Highway tonight on the way home from Ultimate.  It was like:   *BLUR OF BROWN* *gasp* *mini-swerve toward median* *thumpcrunch*  I'm kind of sad now.  Not super much because I believe in the whole "natural selection" thing, and it wasn't like it was someone's pet.  No splatter on my car though.  I kind of feel like I should go back and check to see if it's dead or not, but I don't think I could deal with the gore factor.  This is the biggest thing I've ever "directly" killed.  Not even mice or frogs or anything.  Exercise today: 1 hour Ultimate.  I was lazy tonight...lots of women to play.

       Yipes  I REALLY don't like some of the stuff Blogger's doing.  I want my default to be "edit in HTML" not WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).  *grumble*  My stomach hurts.  I think I'll go grab a coke slurpee (yup, THAT kind of hurts) before Ultimate tonight.  I'm almost finished my first paper.  Thank Deities.  I saw Halle Berry on Leno just now cracking a single tail.  Ye gods.  Pretty lady.  :)  Despite the storyline not having anything to do with the comics, I'm looking forward to Catwoman.  Any time I get to enjoy watching a woman kicking ass is good times for me.  I get all inspired again.  :)  Short attention span requires that I get inspired frequently.  Sorry for the boring posts lately, but I've been mostly working on papers and avoiding working on papers.  As soon as they're finished I plan on doing a bunch of knitting.  I have a couple of projects going (Drew's blanket WILL be finished before she's one!) and enough yarn now to clothe a medium sized village.  I truly have a sickness.  I have decided that yarn is no longer allowed to go on clearance at work, and if it does, people are not allowed to draw my attention to it by bringing it through my till.  :)  Incidentally, if anyone is going to make...I don't know...a baby blanket...CHECK YOUR GAUGE!!  This blanket is about three times as big as I thought it was going to be.  Ah well.  It'll be finished by the time it's cold enough for Drew to need it, plus it'll be big enough for her to use until she's in kindergarten.  :)

       So very haircut entry.  A very nice thing about having a boyfriend with long hair?  I've been collecting elastics like crazy the last couple of weeks.   Wearing my hair down, then getting sick of it after an hour and elastic-jacking a couple of his.  :)  Went to see King Arthur the other night.  It was pretty good.  I know  urlLink who I'm dressing up as for the next costume event.   :)  It shouldn't be too hard.   urlLink The costume's all straps.   Lame:  I think I miscounted how many laps I did on Monday.  :(  I did a LOT more jogging today and my time was exactly the same.  Exercise today: 1 lap each warmup/cool down, 6 laps (1.5 miles)-16 minutes

       Wow.  Thank you everyone who's commented so far on my depression post.  I've already been using some of it, especially the "baby steps" idea and "F.U. depression...I'm in charge" and *cross fingers, knock wood* I'm feeling a bit more in control.  For example...look down just a little.  Exercise today: 400 m walking to warm up, 2.4 km walking and jogging (16 minutes...down 1 minute from last time)  Yay! I did that this morning after tutoring.

       Essay Topics  For those of you who have expressed an interest in the papers that I'm writing, or would like to lend a hand, here are the topics:   Paper the First  (due July 16, 2000-2500 words) Consider the following statistics:  "97% of film distribution in Canada is controlled ouside the country; foreign-controlled publishers and agencies account for 75 percent of Canadian textbook sales; and fourteen foreign-controlled  companies wer responsible for 66 percent of all new releases and 84 percent of total sales in the recording industry in Canada during 1993-4"  ( Borderlands: How we talk about Canada,  W.H. New, 1998).  This is the state of the national boundary-line: unstable.  But, is it inevitable?  Write an essay discussing Canada's cultural industries and its cultural survival.   Paper the Second   (due July 19, 10 pages/3000 words) Many aspects of staples theory were developed to address particularities in Canada’s historical path of economic, social, and cultural development.  As globalization proceeds apace, however, some would argue that the relevance of staples theory to Canada has declined at the same time that the circumstances described by staples theorists have increasingly come to characterize the situation of other countries in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere. Critically assess the merits of this position.  MY THESIS: The relevance of staples theory to Canada has declined at the same time that the circumstances described by staples theorists have increasingly come to characterize the situation of other countries in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere.  I have a bit more on the second one in the way of outline.  Comment if you want my outline.  :)

       None of this is real.  Depression and hormones are a nasty combination.  I need to keep reminding myself that I'm really not feeling this way...although really, I am feeling it.  Confused yet?  I know I am.  Incidentally, this isn't a cry for help or anything.  In fact, I'm feeling pretty good today, just a bit tired.  So, feel free to give advice in the comments (as long as it isn't just "snap out of it" or "get over it")  I mostly just want to write it down to get a perspective on it in a couple of days.  I haven't been officially diagnosed as clinically depressed or manic, but depression is as good a buzz word as any.  In my case it manifests less as intense sadness, although that's been happening much more lately as well.  Quite often, it's a little voice (I think I'll name it The Demon) who prods me with thoughts of failure, fears of failing and "what's the point?" and "we all just end up dead anyway" thoughts.  He's a fun guy to have at parties.  */sarcasm*  One result of this is that I need to force my body to do things.  Most people think "Hmm...there's a piece of paper on the floor.  I'll just grab it."  and then they do it.  For me, it's a huge effort.  I get tired as soon as I think about doing housework, homework or physical activity.  I will have a backpack, purse or shopping bag in my car on the passenger seat and I physically will NOT be able to reach over and grab it to take into the house, so I'll leave it there and be worried about getting broken into.  Anything with multiple steps in it is horribly difficult.  If I need to get changed to go to the gym or the track, there's no way I can do it.  Getting gas is an ordeal.  I'll be too tired to stop and get gas for five minutes.  I will miss things that I love, like karate, because the thought of ironing my uniform, getting in the car, driving there and changing into my uniform frightens me.  Isn't that pathetic?  :p  Then of course, when I miss doing exercise or going to karate or something, The Demon pops up and tells me what a failure I am for missing out on whatever it is.  This makes me feel worse of course.  Another fun thing that happens is that I'll have intense worries spinning through my head as soon as I lie down to go to sleep.  It's stupid things, usually, but that doesn't stop them from running around and around until I want to scream with frustration and lobotomize myself with a Q-tip.  I've been more emotional lately.  I got very affected by a "You Damn Kid" comic and kept getting teary eyed whenever I thought of it.  It's so incredibly annoying.  When I get frustrated, I'll start crying.  I hate that.  I despise crying, especially in front of people, which frustrates me even more.  I seem to remember being more intelligent.  :p  Maybe that'll be solved with more sleep.  I've been reading a couple of blogs from people who are on, have been on, or are trying to wean themselves off of anti-depressants, and I don't think that's the way to go for me yet.  I've had some counselling at the university last year which seemed to help.  Anyone have any suggestions?

       La ti da di da.  I should be working on a paper right now.  In fact, there are numerous things I should be doing right now.  Instead, I'm at Candyman's house waiting for my lunch to be ready and blogging like a lady of leisure.  I surprised him this morning and came over to visit after going to a martial arts casting call downtown.  It was ok, I guess.  I didn't have the right chromosomes for what they're looking for as a fighter, but I might get in as an extra.  Who knows?  So I came over and we watched an episode of Highlander and that's my day so far...how about yours?

       Zzzzzzzzzz...  After pretty much not sleeping over the last three days, and having craptacular sleep the last two weeks, I am happy to report that the Random Synapses team received 9 SOLID HOURS of sleep last night.  I am very very happy.  I didn't realize how depressed I'd been over the last week or so.  I do not understand how mothers of infants can push themselves through that.  I am so impressed, and a little frightened of the thought of having a child of my own.  I think I'll adopt one when they're...twenty or so.  That way they can pay rent, and I won't have to feed them at night.  They can make their own damn sandwiches.  :)

       Ouch.   Or: the post in which I muse about why it is that I seem to be ending upside down briefly during my recent workouts.  And also landing on my head.   Ulti was fun tonight...after really sucking badly.  We played a team which doesn't really know the meaning of "Spirit" or "sportsmanship" but then we played a game with an awesome team.  In the first game I made a wicked bid for the disc, barely missing it as I dove for it and rolled...somehow landing on my head at one point...  I got many cheers though.  :)  I got to score a point in the second game...perfect set play execution on everyone's part.  :)  Exercise today: 2 hours Ultimate

       I do believe...  ...someone should invent a way for people to eat peanut butter and jam/jelly without all that unnecessary bread to get in the way.  A way besides scooping peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon, then following it with a chaser of honey or jam...  Not that I've ever done that.  Nope...not me... :)  Stupid "falling asleep at 800 and having my brother come home and start playing records in the basement next to my room at midnight."  Grrrr.  Good raspberry jam though.  Too bad there's all that bread getting in the way.

       *pats self on back*  I managed to go into not one, but TWO stores which I would normally buy one (or ten) things from and walked out without taking anything home with me.  I am very happy.  Incidentally, Abraham Books on Commercial Drive is a really neat bookstore.  Unfortunately (fortunately?) they didn't have anything that I really super NEEDED to buy...many things I was interested in though.  And I got to have ice cream today.  That was good.  Since I wasn't doing enough of this lately...*loves Drew!*  *kisses!*  :)  Exercise today: walked 12 blocks or so

       I'm so weak sometimes.  Sometimes you just want to say yes, but you also want to say no...and you hope that it's taken out of your hands...but only in the way that you want it.  And it's so hard when you're really not sure exactly what you want to happen.  At least I didn't say yes.  I had a beer tonight for the first time since I don't know when.  I guess I'm not a non-drinker anymore.  And you know what?  I'm ok with that.  I have many reasons...not just the one that most of my Dear Readers will immediately think of...and right now, none of them are very good.  Expensive: I've got several bottles in my cupboard, already paid for.  One might argue that it would be more expensive (at least per volume) if I didn't drink them.  Health: I haven't been eating much junk food...this will be my junk food.  Besides, I worked out today.  Exercise today: 1 1/2 karate

       Politicking  About a week ago I found out that a place I'd thought was above this kind of thing actually has some cliquing and some apparently rather nasty politics going on.  I really hate that.  I guess it was a little naive in that I figured it was immune.  *sigh*  I guess it just shows that whenever you get more than one or two people together there's going to be some backbiting and bitching.  How depressing.  :(  Nothing I can really do about it though...and I don't really want to, since I don't know the details...only what one person briefly mentioned to me.  I don't even know who the other person/people are who are involved.  I figure the best thing for me to do is what I always do: keep my own honour and stay as neutral as I can.  But still...it tarnishes things a bit.

       I had the weirdest dream last night.  I can practically hear everyone rolling their eyes at that one.  :)  Don't worry, it'll be quick.  It mostly involved  urlLink Justy ,  urlLink Bimkins  and myself driving up to SFU at 0700 (oddly enough, that was the time I woke up this morning) so that the guys could get to a registration meeting for rowing and classes (?!  I don't know what that was all about either).  After some discussion of girl on girl bondage anime (not something that the three of us would probably ever discuss...) we started talking about papers...more specifically, the fact that I've got two ten pagers due in two weeks and I'm really stressed about it.  (Obviously, because I'm dreaming about it.)  One of them mentioned that if I was to do a page each day on each of them, I'd finish them off.  ...  ...  Would you believe that I've never thought about it in that way before?!  I've been taking courses at the university for the last...seven years...and I've always stressed about papers, and now I think my subconscious has finally gotten sick of that.  Woo, says I.  Woo, indeed.  Sidenote: in my dream we had stayed up all night until 0700, so when I woke up this morning (after sleeping from about 2030 last night) I thought I'd stayed up all night, despite the fact that I wasn't really tired.  It took me until I'd gotten up to take my shower to realize that since I was DREAMING about staying up all night, I was actually asleep and thoroughly rested.  :p  Heh.  Maybe I should take a nap.

       Fun, fun.  You have got to love a job that allows you a couple of minutes every so often to blog.  :)  My student is currently working on her workbook, so I've got ten minutes to catch up on my blogroll and do a quick blog.  *whine* My back and neck hurt today...not sure exactly why.  Might have slept funny, or Ultimate might have done it.  I'm really tired today as well.  I think I'll try to get to sleep as soon as I get home and do a few things.  I'm getting a little worried about homework.  I think I'll be pulling back from friends for a week or so to try and make sure everything stays on schedule.  :p  I need some more self control...less random internet surfing and more homework/sleep.

       Awa' wi' ye!  I've been particularly succeptible to the hiccups today.  I was at C/M's Ultimate BBQ, and after the game I got the hiccups really badly for at least fifteen minutes.  This was the first time in a REALLY long time.  Now, I just got home and I've got them again.  Ugh.  I hope I don't get them for 57 years like that one guy.  I'm sure by the time I read the comments I'll be finished with them...but just in case, everyone tell me what your hiccup remedy is.  :)  (update: 12:35-Ooh.  I think they're gone...apparently reading webcomics is a hiccup remedy.  Who knew?!  Please do send me your remedies though.  I'm interested.)

       Quizzy  I got  urlLink this  from  urlLink Donna .   You are an SRCL--Sober Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you an Ayn Rand ideal. Taggart? Roark? Galt? You are all of these. You were born to lead. You may not be particularly exciting, but you have a strange charisma--born of intellect and personal drive--that people begin to notice when they have been around you a while. You don't like to compromise, but you recognize when you have to.  You care absolutely nothing what other people think, and this somehow attracts people to you. Treat them well, use them wisely, and ascend to your rightful rank.     Ye flipping gods. This is so amazingly incorrect that I can't believe that this is the same stuff I imput into the quiz.

       Darned heat wave.   urlLink Dave  came over last night around 10 or 11 and stayed until 4:30 in the morning.  He was helping me clean my room.  Oh dear god.  Did we ever clean...  I have removed over a garbage bag of clothes, purses and bags from my closet and dresser, I have about 1/2 a garbage bag of paper to recycle and very little actual garbage.  None of the clothing is really all that great...but if anyone wants to look through it, comment or email.  I'm about a size 12-16, Large/XLarge.  I actually had the space to do my kata inside my room.  I am shocked.  Also, I'm getting rid of a bunch of cheesy romance novels which will bring me no money at the used book store.  Anyone want them?  They're yours.  And I am more than slightly sneezy.  I HATE having allergies to dust.  Bloody flaming...  >:(  Oh and I found a digital camera that someone loaned me...er...over two years ago now...  They have never asked for it back...I need someone to tell me the correct and moral thing to do which allows me to keep the camera.  ;)  Comment on ways for me to justify keeping this camera!!  Things to do this week:  -finish cleaning my closet -go through some boxes to get them out of my room -visit  urlLink NNY  and Drew.  (How's tomorrow evening for you guys?) -Tutor and work -clean off the couch -clean off the desk if I have time -go through my craft magazines and recycle most of them.  Anyone want scrapbooking or rubber stamping magazines?  To recap the stuff I'm giving away... -clothes sizes 12-16 -craft magazines -romance novels  If you're embarassed about wanting any of it, you can always email me at kinkygrrl1701@yahoo.com

       Dumbass...  So instead of going to bed early last night, I stay up and watch much Highlander with Dave, then work today, then tutor now, and I'll be going out tonight.  At least I get to sleep in tomorrow.  Yeesh.  I'm such a dummy.  Incidentally...it's SO much easier to tell when Immortals die on Highlander... there's that whole head being chopped off thing, and the whole Quickening... I mean DAMN!  It's really hard to tell when a MORTAL is being killed.  Jeez.

       Copious amounts of spare time.  For once I get to say that without it being sarcastic!  So what do I do on my first evening of CAST?  I tweak my ankle at Ulti.  Yeah, the same one, dammit.  And I had to say goodbye to Bimkins and Rini.  :(  Sadness.  And I ate McD's again tonight.  MUCH sadness.  Blech.  BUT I am finished my exam.  T-29 days of freedom.  To do: send in many applications for a career type job, sleep, watch much Highlander, sleep some more.  Did I mention I'm a little tired?  Exercise today: 1 hour Ultimate

       WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Rah rah rah!  I'm finished my final!  Yay!  I did reasonably well, I think.  Lowest mark I could possibly get in the course is a C+.  It's nice going into a final with an A...means that if I get my name right, I pass the course.  There were only three questions on there that I had no idea.  I guessed correctly what the CLC was, BS'd enough about the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and can't find MFN in my textbook. It has something to do with the Canadian Political Economy...because, well, that's what my course is on. Anyone want to enlighten me?  m0rph?  ;)  Tonight is Ultimate.  Tonight is also sleep-imate.  Much sleeping.  Very tired.  More cola was consumed this semester than in many moons.

       SUGAH!!  SUGAH!!!  I have been eating craptacularly poorly over the last week or so.  Chips, mini-donuts, other junk, pure sugar in the form of strawberry Mentos and cotton candy and Coke... Yuck.  No wonder I've got a headache.  Although that probably has more to do with having a brutal kink in my neck all night.  It kept me up, and I've got a migraine-esque headache now.  Bleah.  Cotton candy: it's like crack, but blue.  I know I've said it before, but dammit, it's true.  Now, back to my regularly schedule studying...and lunch.  Something without mass quantities of sugar, caffiene or deep-fried evil.

       And another thing:  GO!  Run and help Peechie  urlLink Save the Boobies .  Warm and fuzzy feelings will abound.  I mean, come on.  Ladies...you like your breasts.  Guys...you like our breasts.  Help a courageous woman raise some money for breast cancer research!  SOMEONE YOU KNOW WILL OR HAS HAD BREAST CANCER.  Get your asses in gear and skip a day of Starbucks.  Bring your coffee in a thermos for once and pass on that $5 to her.

       Ugh  My tummy hurts.  It always hurts.  Or feels sick.  Or feels generally icky.  Maybe it's about time to mention this fact to my doctor.  Oogh.  I really think I ought to have stock in Tylenol, Gravol and Tums.  I'm so tired as well.  I think that I'm worn out from this semester.  I can't wait until Thursday 3pm because that will be my last final!  Things I plan to do during my almost-month off. -spend some quality time with Dave. -visit with friends I don't see enough of. -visit with friends I NEVER get to see!! -finish knitting Drew's baby blanket (40-50 more rows to go!!) -work in my garden -read a whole bunch -CLEAN MY ROOM (remove roughly half the stuff that's in there and chuck, recycle and charity-ize it.) -watch the three seasons of Queer as Folk I borrowed from Bimkins -do the cross stitch hummingbirds on towels that was my mom's Mother's Day present. -work out way more, especially training for karate.  Speaking of karate...I will hopefully be doing my first grading just before my 25th birthday.  Yay!

       So. Much. Walking.  Yesterday was the Vancouver Pride Parade and I must say, I have not done that much walking in a very long time.  I don't know how far these distances are, but I walked from Granville skytrain to Davie Street for the parade, then back to Burrard Skytrain to drop off  urlLink Bimkins  and Rini, then back to Davie to visit with  urlLink some  of  urlLink my   urlLink friends  two of whom had marched in the parade.  Fortunately, on the way back I was with someone who actually had an inkling of how the downtown buses go.  I still had to walk about half a kilometer to  urlLink Dave's  house afterwards though.  So, the parade itself: There was so much queer-positive energy...I've NEVER felt anything like that.  Probably there were over 100 000 people turned out in support of the GLBT community.  I loved it.  Totally amazing.  I wanted to cry at several points:  seeing the family groups going by with kids of all ages (including teens) holding their parents hands, parents groups holding signs saying "I support my gay daughter" and "So proud of my gay son", seeing signs for people who have been married after being couples for 10, 20 or more years and the HIV positive and AIDS groups.  While many people got sunburned, I was in the shade for most of the parade and was actually cold enough that I needed to drape one of my spare skirts around my shoulders in a denim half cape to try and warm up!!  Then there were after parade drinks over at Dw00 and Dev's house.  They've got a nice view of the water!  And I was introduced to the joy of gin and tonic (which reminds me...I really should replace that bottle I drank most of... :/ )  Best part of G and T...it glows under blacklights!!  Tee hee.  So, I have a slight headache today...most due to exhaustion, not alcohol.  Much fun ensued!  Had a great time for my first Pride parade.  It won't be my last.  I need to start taking the bus more.  I get less lost when other people are driving.  :D  I also need to move closer to downtown.  I have WAY too many people I need to see more of.  Exercise yesterday: assloads of walking.
