      Alright kiddies, I have a bottle of champagne in me right now, so I thought it would be interesting to see what happens here. The thing with this blog is that it is written "cold" in that I don't write rough drafts - I write what I think, as I think it - this should be interesting, or at the very least - depressingly amusing.  I'm watching the fourth season of The Simpsons right now - the series is even more surreal. I really want to jack off right now. I feel like stripping off my clothes ans pounding it right now. I'm laughing at even the most trifle of Simpsons jokes.   If you've been high on Mary Jane, you may have experienced sensory deprivation. My fingers are asleep. Oh no, the series just said something serious, and I laughed. I prefer not watching the screen, I like listening to the voices right now. Maybe I can create a song based on sound bites.  I never realized how still the series was - or maybe thats because I can't care right now - although I am trying to correct my abysmal spelling - its never been my strong point.  "Cloud goes up, cloud goes down."  I can't feel my face.  or my fingers - which you know - or my palms, which you didn't.  The bottle of champagne is nifty - its from Spain, and has metal on the bottle. The taste is dry and not that bad, thou I adore Veuve Cliquot or "J" - both are quite tasty.   My arms are not numb - tingly describes it. I want something to snack on. OOOh, pretzles, hang on.  I am wobbling when I walk, but I dropped my keyboard, I'm trying to keep at least cohearant whilst typing, but my entire body is numb - but happy feeling.  My neck is like a noodle.  Leaning back feels good. My thumb, hell all fingers hurt from typing - not too painful, but noticeable.  My neck no longer exhists, my head feels really good either against the shair, or my chin against my chest.  The room spins when I close my eyes - not on a horizonal axis, but a vertical one - I am instantly remined of a slot machine.  I think "Marge is ugly" I lagugh at my thought, and rest my head on the chair. My thumb - it hurts. Even scratching enhances my numbness, except in my fingers which - hurt.   I want to masturbate, my thumb hurts - its the episode where Springfirled gets a monorail. The pretzels aren't making the best of their flavor - but I - ugh I don't know. Ow, my thumb.  Is that an astronaut on that street?  Closing my eyes feels really good.  Shut up grandpa.Um, the pretzels are drying my mouth, I should get water. My thumb. Yumm, C2. Monorail. Damn pretzelsl, like cement between my gums and lips. I want to keep my eyes closed. Monorail - pretzles, dry, chwing with laughs. Saiva - where are you? I'm trying to stay level headed - it doesn't seem to be working, When I laugh, I close my eyes and put my head against the chair. I want to get naked, hang on.  Yay, I'm naked, and numb. I just took a piss, and kept bobbing all around - and yet - I got every drop in the bowl. No more pretzels. Damn.   I usually watch Will and Grace when drunk, as Karen is a high end drunk and it makes the show that musch cooler - yeah. I can't pay attention to the screen. Seeing Krusty while drunk is frightening. "Farrah want out!" Actually, I'll want out if hung over, but I am not hung nor am I over. I'm going to get some water. Pretzles are still wedged in between my gums and teeth.   Usually when I drink a bottle of champagne - usually Veuve - I don't wobble and bob about so much, or maybe I do - I just haven't been concious of it, so I wanted to make an entry of it - I thought it would make for an enlightening experience. I'm gonna see what else I have to morsel upon. Nothing. I went to the city and so I'm bare in the cupboard and clothing industry.  I'm sitting, when I close my eyes, I feel like I'm rolling inside a tire - back first. It is now 2:02 acording to the clock in my bed room. I'll end here. Just know that I'll be masturbating and ten passing out. Nite.

      The clouds were spread thin across the sky. Going towards the horizon, the clouds seemed to have been blended together, then dispersing to create a sight that never fails to make one sentimental - that sight being a beautiful sunset. I couldn't ask for a better "welcome home" than that sight. This happened on the train, going to Emeryville where I then take a bus to San Francisco.   I went into the city for pride weekend, but really don't want to talk about it. Not because I didn't enjoy myself - because I did. Maybe I'll come back to it, maybe I won't - but quite frankly, I'm a hell of a lot more interested recalling the relief I had felt in San Francisco. Quite honestly, San Francisco is my Tiffany's. While I'm not naive enough to think that nothing bad will happen to me there, I do feel a comfort there. It isn't the comatose comfort of familiarity, its a feeling that creates sensations in the body's nerves that lets one know that this isn't a case of "Araby" in that I am placing something on a pedistal that I know nothing of. This is a feeling of - well to put the seal on the Hallmark card - home.   Feelings like this can be attributed to the amazing times I've had in this city. It could be the friends and chosen family that reside there. It could be the fact that I am perfectly at ease in this city, and I don't mean that because I know I can be myself there - its more, and yet its hard for me to put my finger on. I do generally know my way around - I've noticed patterns as far as tourism, locals, and all surrounding occurences and attitudes. But these experiences would have had a much different impact if set in another environment. This isn't mere conjecture, there is - and I hate to sound so spiritual about it, but for lack of a better word - an aura to the city. The city is a living entity - its a place where I would know I'm there if I was blindfolded. Not because of the noises, even those exclusive to San Francisco - there is a feeling that trickles over me. It could be excitement for activities that I am about to engage in, except that I get this way even if I'm just going to a General Meeting (which are hardly heart thumping adventures.)  I'm back in Sacramento now. The feeling is of relaxation that I don't have to worry about catching busses or trains. I have my own bed in my own room, and its nice. I appreciate the nuns that have given me shelter, and the nuns that will give me shelter. I thank them greatly, but its nice to know that even in a place like Sacramento - I can come to a base to decompress and be alone. This isn't "home" but it does make for a nice re-charging station.

      This one gets me immediately. What I mean is when asked what one believes I've come across: well as a (insert dogma here)..., or ( my dogmatic group) believes...  Um, well what do YOU believe?  Then I get: Well I'm a (dogmatic group) so...  Great so, you are another's beliefs. Generally speaking, human emotion in all its highs and lows, the experiences that have created your story - were fabricated to fit these beliefs?   You formed your life not based on what makes you happy, but by what someone else thinks leads to happiness? You have denied yourself to attain a greater understanding or higher concious? So you have set yourself up for failure. I never got how denying one's nature helps one attain bliss. True, overabundance is hardly healty, but is that part of your nature? Is there a fear that it could be, or that it will be again?   I'm on this because I reached my current storyline by trial and error. Error being an important factor in growth. The thing is, I have always questioned. Answers did not come. I wasn't talking to myself, there were physical bodies that my voice was directed towards, but I might was well have struck up a conversation with the rug. Well, saying answers didn't come is hardly fair. Acceptable answers didn't come.   There is a difference between belief, acceptance, and finding your thoughts expressed in dogma. That may seem like an elementary level sentance, but the obvious is rarely mentioned, because its considered known, but actions do negate that thought.   I affiliated myself with my current religion, out of a combination of personal experience and well, because I did find my thoughts expressed in dogma. This is different from agreeing! When I'm asked what I believe, I will tell you what I believe at that point through my experience. I will not read off bullet points of my dogma, because dogma does not and will not rule me - and yet that belief - does infact run me. This isn't me poking about blindly, this is experience. I said I won't say that as a (dogmatic group) I believe one thing or another, and I don't. To pound this into the ground: I don't do what I do because my dogma requires it, I do it because it is what will give me pleasure in doing. This doesn't stop me from doing the things that cause grief, my experience has shown me that grief is indeed human, and a feeling that not many others are willing to admit to.  Key Word: Dogma

      First I just want to say that I'll be leaving late Wednesday and spending a few days in San Francisco for pride festivities. I can't wait!   And now...  The dream entry.  I don't know how often these will pop up, but I thought it would be good to finally get one of my dreams written down. To get to San Francisco, I take the train, in my dream I traded the train tickets for a flight to France. As soon as I steped outside the airport, I was at Euro Disney. Here's where I tell you that I've been to neither. Even when I've been places dozens of times, it will never appear in my dream as it is in real life.   An example(besides the rest of this story) is that I was on a monorail headed to Disney's Haunted Mansion which was a bright and cheery bed and breakfast. When I say bright and cheery, I mean the whole nine yards of bright sun, sheer billowing curtains, all walls and fixtures are white - you know the stuff suburbanites cream over.   Upon entry to Euro Disney, I come upon a model of The Matterhorn. It looks like one of those ceramic trees in those tacky christmas villages that people love to display on their table tops. The rides I come across look like cheap carnival rides. There's a boat ride that has children getting off midway and running off into the park.   Throughout the dream I am concerned about the fact that I only had a one way ticket, so I leave the park and there I am back in the airport in France. However, just like in real life - my credit cards are maxed and I have a smallish amount of money left in the bank - definately not enough to fly back home, so I do what any sensible person does - I went back to Euro Disney. For some reason, I remember paying $42 to get in the first time. I don't know where the number came from - its been a while since I've read Hitchhiker's Guide, though I don't think this is a reference to that series.   The Haunted Mansion here is just an over grown greenhouse selling creepy posters. The Alice in Wonderland ride seems to have borrowed elements of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.   Here's where I get anti-climactic on you. That's all I remember. I had woken up a few times and had a few other dreams, but what I just told you is what I remember.  Key Word: Real.

      I was asked and so it shall be answered.  Specifically: So, may I ask, Why a bloody nun? or more precisely a murderous, axe-wielding, blood covered nun?  Ah where to start? I really don't know the beginning. It could be the ritual in Eyes Wide Shut with the cloaked figures wearing Venetian masks. It could be when I was a Postulant in the order and did my make up so it looked like I had a black eye. It was not the first time I purposefully made myself look like hell. Then came the argument with one of the sisters. To sedate my anger I watched a lot of zombie movies and played Resident Evil constantly - among other things.  I had tried to do a full "face" but I didn't like how it looked. I didn't want symmetry. So I was putting on the clown white and stoped at a bit over halfway. My mouth and lower cheek was covered in white, then I left the rest. I liked it, my mind jumped to the dazzling of cruise ships during World War Two. They would paint the cruise ships in ways that would break up the lines, and it would be difficult to tell which way the ship was going. I also thought of the end of Fantasia. Yeah, wondering how they're connected? So am I, but this is the train of thought. The end of Fantasia is Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Its the sacred and the profane. Again I liked it. Once I had the not quite half and half, I wanted the portion with the white - or the mask as it is thought of - to resemble Venetian Masks. The other portion would be my skin, but I put a contact that changes the humanity of the eye on that side. So that even though you were seeing my real face on that side, you wouldn't see my real eye - which circles back to the dazzling.  So there's a lot being thrown into the face at its begining. At this point the disagreement had not happened yet. I was trying to do eye makeup as usual, but the white side wasn't cooperating, and the flesh side looked like I was beaten without me intending for it to look that way. Its a good time to state that the colors in my bag are reds, purples, blues, a green and a yellow with black and silvers. So, I guess I painted myself in a corner with this one, but pastels are not my friends.  Then the disagreement. I won't get into it, but let's just say, that nun doesn't really ask me any questions anymore. So in my rage I played Resident Evil (psychological, survival horror is a new way for me to relax.) I am known to pick up a P.G. Wodehouse book to cheer up, so basically this was not a need for me to kill, it was more of an immersion. Yes it can be said I was running from the issue, but when face to face isn't a good option, immersion is a good way to release so it doesn't all come down on one person. I have done it (hence the MRI in the previous post.)  So you know the roots. Other influences are: I'm majoring in Funeral Service, I've wanted a hearse since I was little, death really isn't that scary, I have a dark and twisted sence of humor, I have a casual interest in psychology. What you don't see in that avatar is a further exploration of the sacred and the profane. I generally wear sexually provacative clothing. The question is: which is sacred, which is profane?  Now murderous axe wielding isn't really correct in that I have yet to do that. I'd have to get into my distaste for the fairy, wiccan, vegan, buddhist conglomeration dogma - which I don't want to in this post. Needless to say, my patience is thin. So I got myself a granny dress. Its floral and lacey - basically their uniform in sister manifestation. So I want to tear the sleeves, throw some blood on it, maybe get a heart from a butcher as my "sacred heart," and carry around an axe a la Lizzie Borden quite simply because the idea amuses me. It was because of the above melting pot dogma that I had the disagreement, and an apologist would say "you should be thankful." No, no I shouldn't. I get enough forced fed dogma from the outside, I really don't want it from people who are supposed to be supportive and helpful to me.  So, to put the above in a word or four: Because it amuses me. Furthermore: I'm not glamorous, I'm not beautiful, the things I find beautiful - depresses and disturbs others. I find beauty in the obscene. I find humor in indignation. I am distressed by willful ignorance. In the end, all of the above means nothing - only through personal experence can "why?" be answered, but I hope that I have at least filled in what could not be obtained otherwise.  Key word: Disagreement.

      The morbid dread or fear of children.  Today I received an invitation from my cousin for his daughter's first birthday. The first thing my cousin sent to my address in Sacramento was four photos of his daughter in various places. Not him and his daughter, not his wife and his daughter, not the family, just the kid. Already these guys live through their offspring. The kid has an agent. I'm not joking, they're putting her on the market to save up for her future - they call it her college education fund, I think future just sounds a bit less - I'm planning to retire on your greatness - type of thing.  See I have a huge discomfort around kids. As with most phobias, my discomfort is rather stupid. I say most because I had an MRI and the doctor said "If there's an earthquake, you'll be totally safe." I hadn't asked. So here I am going head first in this machine that looks like a giant pencil sharpener, being told to relax about something I wasn't concerned about. Naturally, when one is face up with nowhere to look but your shoes (thanks to a very small mirror) there really isn't a lot of places your mind can go. So now I'm claustrophobic.  So yeah, back to the kid. Now showing photos of your work is understandable. Most people like showing off their hard work in hopes for some ego stroking from the general public. This is all just fine and dandy, but what does it have to do with me? I probably wouldn't have taken such exception to the photos if there was a letter from my cousin and his wife telling me about their lives. You know the sort of thing, they're both physical therapists, so I'm not sure how much can leave the office, but these people are bright, somewhat interesting people. I just don't want them to decline into a sort of atrophy where their life is just: work is a block and social life becomes staggering without mentioning the kid's latest exploits. I dread the day when the thing talks.   My main problem is that I am expected to give a rat's ass about everything this kid does. Oh look the first: word, illness, step, rollercoaster, encounter with the mythic duo of santa and the bunny, day of "school." Yes you're proud and thrilled, but I don't care!   This is where life becomes funny in a very cruel way. Kids will flock to me. They'll gather around, they'll stare in wonder - even if my tattoos and septum ring aren't showing. They will run up to me and expect me to take an interest. They'll tell me their pointless stories where ten events happen in five seconds and yet it will take the child hours to relay the story through gasps of excitement. This is when my skin starts to crawl. Its like seeing a roach when you're just about ready to fall asleep. You're all confortable and then panic upon sight. You must obliterate the roach to be able to sleep, and even if you are able to catch the roach, there is an underlying dread that another one will find its way into your gaping mouth. While I don't think children creep around trying to cause me unease in falling asleep, I do get the same feeling of true panic and - quite honestly - disgust when they are around. It might be the pshycological attitudes of the public in that children must be cherished, indulged, protected, disiplined at the same time, and I just don't have the energy. I don't treat adults this way, so children aren't getting off easier. At least, not any more.  Key word: Dread.

      My guardian animal is a skunk.   So here I am, currently Novice Sister Farrah Moans of the San Francisco Order of The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. My motive is quite simply to rid my mind of various - things. I was sitting, and randomly remebered a psychic reading where I chose a card at random. This card was my animal guide or something like that. The image on the card was that of a skunk. See, this is where I tell you that I actually like the smell of skunk. Its not something I'd bathe in, but I am not one to make a scene when the smell is present.   Throughout this experience I will mostly post the random synaptic misfires that occur throughout my day. Sure, sooner or later I'll post my basics, like favorite movies, books, bands, sexual positions and other normal blither that takes up so much space in my brain.   Keywords: Skunk, Random.

      Where has my mind been?   I can't say that my thoughts have been those that require writing. Most of what has happened, has done so behind doors of other's homes. Naturally, I can't - and won't report on what happens behinds the doors of other's homes -I consider my presence there a contract of silence. This is sometimes thrust upon me by various homes, but really - its just something I feel comfortable with. Pretty much I treat secrecy in a psychiatric sense. Unless there is harm about to befall someone, nothing I hear gets repeated by me.   Lets see about the dull dramas.&nbsp;Uh, yeah, pretty dull - love life is flat lining as usual, but that doesn't bother me as much as the lack of jobs. I want money, and I want to feel responsible instead of drained by requirements that I can not&nbsp;live up to at this point. In fact I've had to&nbsp;postpone a trip to San Francisco. I'll have to wait for the end of September to visit&nbsp;The Grand Dame.&nbsp; Though I did just get back. I went&nbsp;for the Dore Alley street fair which was a lot of fun. I did this whole biohazard look, complete with gas mask. Got quite a bit of attention,&nbsp;both good and bitchy. I swear, this community - if you aren't shirt less with leather chaps, and maybe some free appendages, you aren't welcome in the (commercial) underground.&nbsp; The end of September is Folsom which is much larger and much more commercial, so my&nbsp;new outfit should get the usual gasps of pleasure and&nbsp;uncomfortable conformity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ugh. Why is it that even in the underground, one is expected to be the same as others? No wonder I don't go out any more!   I guess it makes sense to say that Dore and Folsom are street fairs in S.F. with Folsom being the better known and larger of the two. For Dore, there are three gates (donations are collected and given to various charities) while there are thirteen at Folsom.&nbsp; Its when the dregs (hi!) come out and be publicly naughty for the prudes. There are signs posted that nudity is illegal. That has yet to stop people from wandering about without pants, and yet I haven't seen the show-offs get arrested or fined.   There are vendors selling overpriced gear - like floggers, various leather accessories, sex toys, porn, food - you know, the usual. There are charities&nbsp;that have booths where if you donate, you can have the shit beaten out of you. Gotta love that! There are demonstrations of various s&m techniques -&nbsp;performances if you will.&nbsp; Oh yeah, these festivls are fetish - leather community based. Don't know why I&nbsp;saved that bit 'til now, guess it just slipped my mind. After a while even electric genital torture doesn't seem like its out of the ordinary scope of mainstream sexuality. &nbsp;

      I just bought a Joy Division album. There is just something about this type of music. Bauhaus, The Cure, Morrissey are the ones everyone knows of, so I'll mention them. They are instantly seen as too dark and or depressing. I happen to find their muic beautiful, inspiring. The music isn't something I sought out because of its connections. More of its history. Like buying a Bowie, Iggy, or Lou Reed album. Its music that is art, and entertainment. Sometimes entertainment for art's sake, but the melodies found in the music of Siouxsie and Joy Division is sonic evolution. You can track the change of the eras from punk to new wave. You can hear revolution without change being hit over your head. This is definitive music that says "I AM history." I instantly imagine the images caught in the era. But this is music that isn't trapped in an age of the fad.   I was fortunate enough to see a re-release of Ziggy Stardust at The Castro Theatre (a marvelous, and gaudy single screen theatre.) Just seeing Bowie do something up there that said (to me) "hey, you know being yourself is an option." True, Ziggy was an image - an image of an era that was tired of repression. It really was an awe inspiring sight, that someone so "out there" could also achieve great moments of intense intamacy. There was no fear of deviating from the televised difference, because that deviation was real, and accepted by those that recognized that deviation as their own.    True, because I didn't live in or remember the era (born in '78) there is no way I could really know what went on, so I could be making the time more romantic than it was, but look what's out there today. I can't remember 9/10ths of the crap that's being shoveled out. This era is Warhol, and it wants to make money off of what is like - instead of what isn't. Music is "safe." True there are those now that I can still be inspired by - Pulp comes to mind instantly. Morrissey is back on track with his newest. I dig The Postal Service, The White Stripes are far too obnoxious for their own good.   The point is that I don't want an American Idol. They are packaged, endorsed, and stitched with a mass market label. Where is the beauty in air brushed sexuality? Why has the bland "family" image been pushed? Even most punk now is geared to getting the most airplay on MTV (which I don't watch - actually, I don't watch broadcast TV at all.) Avril Lavigne? It is pronounced "Bo-wee" - not "Bow-ee" you worthless Hot Topic shopping conformist!

      Its time for one of those "I remember when" stories. Ugh. I was headed to the train station to go to San Francisco - good, fantasitic, orgasmic things happened, but that's not why I'm writing today. Where was I? Oh - um, going to the train station. Now its Summer in Sacramento and its getting into the 90's and will top out in the hundreds. Its a dry, energy sucking heat. I saw a neo-goth in a trenchcoat and all black. That was me. There was a time - even when I lived in Las Vegas that getting me to even wear a short sleeve shirt was like pulling teeth. I covered as much of my body as I could. I hated my body. Its amazing what tattoos have the power to help us do. As soon as I got a tattoo on my calf (I now have one on both legs) I started wearing shorts. The shorts still go past my knees - but. This is where things get interesting. I do dress in drag, so I started wearing shorter dresses. It wasn't on purpose, but all of the sudden, and for no reason I could fathom, I'm comfortable wearing these short monstrosities. I wouldn't wear anything that short in day to day life - including jogging shorts - but for some reason I now feel really happy with my body.   I am actually experiencing pain in my right hand right now. Actually its from just above the wrist to my finger tips. I don't think it's carpal tunnel - but then again I'm not trained to know. Ugh, I'll stop here, so I can rest my arm, I'm not very happy with this entry anyway -I'm rather bored by it. Maybe I'll recall the date I had the night before last. It was my first date. Ever. 'Till next time - hope my hand is OK.

      I just got The Fifth Element on DVD. Its been on my back catalogue want list for a while, and so I decided to finally break down and get a copy. The first thing I did was go directly to The Diva's aria. While I love the visuals and costumes for the film, the real reason for my love of this film is The Diva's aria.   There is a scene in Shawshank Redemption where the Tim Robins inmate plays opera over the loudspeaker. Another character says something to the effect of - I don't know what se's saying, but this is the sound of freedom. Its been a while since I've seen the film, but this line stuck with me because the character is right as far as I'm concerned.   I don't know how this works really, but when I hear an aria - I'd describe it as an out of body experience. Even when the scene is tragic, there is so much life and beauty in the tragedy. When the scene is comic, my intestines turn to freshly blown soap bubbles, light, dancing, carefree. My mind is centered, focused.   I could say that classical scoring does this for me as well, but not to the extent of opera. I think it might be because there is a vocal human emotion that goes along with the emotions on paper in front of the orchestra.  Above all, when I hear opera, I feel relaxed - I lose what feels like 30 pounds. I also feel happy, as I have achieved a much needed - and very real, escape. Even when it is the more intense stuff - Wagner pops to mind, actually, the name shoves its way to the front of my mind, trampling all others - there is that feeling that, and this is quite pretentious of me I know, but really - this is my drug. I hate sounding spiritual, but I honestly think that - in opera - I have found the "other plane" or whatever it is the new age people like to call it now.

      Alright, so I don't do happy all the time. I don't smile all the time, and really, I don't think about smiling or frowning all that much. It doesn't mean I'm depressed, last I checked, yeah I have problems that I need to work out - being jobless, "living" in Sacramento after moving from San Francisco. I did the move for school purposes, and I need to deal with that, and I'm perfectly capable of doing so. I'm not frowning because I'm here - only when I come back after having visited a real city, and remembering how much I left behind, but then I remember that I left it behind to better myself. This thought doesn't make me estatic by any streatch of the imagination, but I'm hardly reaching for the razor blade.  Things could be better, but they could be worse - its an emotional void actually, I'm not numb, I just can't be bothered by extremes right now as they drain my energy, which I need to focus on getting the hell out of Dodge.  I have been reminded by friends that I am far too guarded. My first thoughts (yes all at once) are: Fuck you, they're right, there's nothing I can do that I'm comfortable doing. There are those that find comfort in the bottle, those that find comfort in pills or needles, and those that find comfort in the smoke. I do fit in the bottle group, my guard does drop, and I'm more sociable. I do't want to find comfort in any of those things, which is why I  rarely  drink, and I have done both "E" and the leaf, but have no need or desire to do them again. I want to find my comfort on my own, with my own strength, see what I can do - and work off that.  Some of the other sisters have indulged in the leaf and bottle, and being the sober one, I see that there is no strength in these activities. I've witnessed their strength without the substances. They believe there is strength - or some shamanistic wisdom in imbibing while doing public service. Do they (the ones that do indulge) do a good job with blessings while high - honestly, yes they do. The ones that don't indulge - do a good job as well. Is it fair for me to judge? I think it is, especially because I know what these people are capable of on their own - they seem to believe they need a crutch - or an idol to say "this helped." This is my opinion of what I see.  What does this have to do with my superficial happiness or lack thereof? I want it all to be real, natural - it means more (to me, the one feeling the emotions). I won't stop myself from happiness or sadness as doing so is (in my opinion) unhealthy. Just because I'm not smiling, does not mean I'm not happy - and anyone who's worked reatil can tell you that is really easy to think "I hate you, you foul cheap bastard" while smiling.
