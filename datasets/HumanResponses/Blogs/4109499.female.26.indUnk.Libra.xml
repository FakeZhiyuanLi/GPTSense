       i put this off for a while but a few nights ago i had a dream with my grandma in it. we call her "Buni". the Romanian diminutive for grandmother. the dream was a bit scary and extremely sad. this is probably the second time EVER that i remember crying in my sleep. my grandma was dead, in this dream. we were standing side by side, she and i. her left arm wrapped around my waist and my right arm draped around her shoulder. i turned right to look in her face and our eyes met squarely. she had this beautiful smile on her face and this peaceful look comforted me. i was happy for a moment. i looked away for a second and one of my aunts (not my favorite hehe)was standing in front of me...yapping about something and she didn't even notice my grandma standing there. immediately i knew that i was standing next to my grandmother's ghost or spirit. i was a bit angry at first because my aunt was ignoring Buni but then i realized she couldn't see her. i looked back at Buni again and that same radiant smile looked back at me...but this time her face started to deteriorate...starting with her chin. that's when i started crying...woke up crying. i was heartbroken. i remember falling asleep again and not dreaming anymore. in the morning i woke up wiping tears from my eyes once again. i know my grandma will pass soon. don't know when. i'm glad that i had a chance to see her this summer. i didn't know that i still had tears left. when i told my mom about the dream, i cried again. i love Buni.

       i watch the scarcely star lit southern California sky while you, no doubt, are waking up to another tomorrow the sun is rising over the eastern European sky in blue and purple hues that make my knees weak i wonder if some part of me remains in your mind if i could ever be the a light hearted, kindred spirit you might desire the endless sunflower filled fields call my name asking, begging me to come back to my real home but for now, i sit alone trying to figure out how or where on this earth our two time zones can meet again how can i possibly shrink this massive globe and bring the coast to your front door the deep blue sky stares back blankly at me clearly, there are no answers for me, not tonight so i'm going to sleep again, i'll send you my energy for another day of that fast-paced walking that always made my heart skip a beat hoping that we can talk and walk across town again, soon.

       so the other night i had this strange dream. actually not that strange. let me back up and mention that i fell in love with Romania the last time i was there this past july. there was a bridge that we crossed a few times over the river Mures to get back to my aunt's apartment from the hair salon. in my dream...i was on the opposite side of the bridge trying to get over to the side of the bridge where my aunt and grandma live. the weird thing was that the bridge was broken. it had a big gaping hole in the middle of it. i was in a car, trying to drive over. on top of that, there was another car in front of me, stopped. the person in that car was probably wondering if they were willing to take the plunge in order to get to the other side of the city. looking at that hole in the bridge, i knew there was no way i could make it over with my car, even if i got a really good speedy start. cars don't fly in real life, maybe in dreams, they do. in my dream, i looked behind me and saw that i could take a longer way over to Arad (instead of taking the bridge) by leaving my car there and walking the long way around. i'm not sure which way that was. i just remember sitting there wondering how i was going to get back to Arad....i know this dream is trying to tell me something. the quickest way back to Romania might be over that bridge but it's not going to be easy, i'm going to probably get wet, it seems that it's impossible to get over that bridge with a car. clearly i need to get rid of my car either way. hehe...don't i know it!! the long way there might be more secure, i can walk and i won't have to struggle to swim across the river. i won't have to make any huge jumps into cold, dangerous waters? who knows. i hope i have another dream that tells me more about what i should do. this is really the first time that i've had a dream like this where i truly believe a message was being conveyed to me. i wish it was more clear. i wanted to get this down before i forgot the dream. i really want the quick way out of here and back to Romania. maybe the quick way will be harder and require more courage and possible hardships. what's a girl to do? i'm not usually a risk taker. is this dream telling me that NOW is the time to start? who knows??

        listening to Billie Holiday on a slowly cooling southern cali night. thinking about someone who reminded me that Billie Holiday is truly amazing. thank you, you know who you are, if you ever read this. this music is so much better than TV. i think my TV is dying. i should just throw it away. here goes the my first blogger poem :       Ode To My Dying TV              oh, crappy TV set           kept me company for so many nights      but now loneliness is my friend      why do i even need you anymore?      i can barely see the images you      attempt to transmit.      so, is today the day      that i do away      with your wretched,      almost lifeless form?      well, maybe not today.      so much for tough talk.
