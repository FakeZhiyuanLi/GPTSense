      Working in an office, as we all know, does not come without a rule book.  I would like to point out a few of those that are not being followed here in my building.  1. No matter what the urgency, DO NOT have your cooter Dr. results faxed to your office.  No matter who you "think" are your friends, no matter how many "confidential" stamps upon it, someone will read it and disclose your identity.  *  I will not reveal who or what disease was discovered yesturday via fax*  2.  If you purchase clothes off Ebay such as a J-Lo brand, don't flash it off like it's freakin' Versace.  It's not.  It's J-Lo brand and you look like a ho.  3.  I'm over dried up flowers.  Sentimental or not I don't wanna see 'em everyday.  4.  If you're going to talk shit about another co-worker, please wait until all employees who may hear you leave the building.  For they will just come right out & tell that person: BTW,  Ms. Thang over there's talkin' shit.  Now look! We gotta take a step outback!  I think that's all I have.  I'm headed out of town! ;) I hope to enjoy my weekend. I also hope my husband comes to his senses by tomorrow.  Blondie & The Psychodelic Furs are playing in downtown &amp; I don't want to hang solo.

      This evening, I am headed out of town.   Now that I think of it, I'm actually just leaving the city for over night. :)  Isn't that odd how when you say "I'm going out of town" people automatically assume you're going on some lavish vacation?  I always say that & when I get that response think, "Out of town"  means just that, I'm leaving my town, to go to another town.  If I was going on vacation, I'd say so!! But I digress...  Considering the fact that my husband is playing his "I'm ignoring you game," I'm looking forward to not seeing him for a day or so.   I have no idea what's up his butt recently.   You'd think I had The Black Plague.  My mother is coming into town in 2 weeks, so that's about the time the "big fights" start.  Either right before she gets in town & thru her visit or while she's visiting &amp; afterwards.   So the first option is happening as we speak. Actually, it's just the rumble of the storm to come.    I told RD last night: What would you do if you woke up and I wasn't home @ 510 p.m. like I am everyday? Would you worry? Do you even give two shits? This vicious cycle he has with me is wearing me down.  The minute I start showing affection twards him he turns on me.  Then I end up looking like an ass because I say : Oh I'm soooo in love .  And then he does this crap to me and I want to take him out back & beat his ass.  Marriage.  PHAH!! I should've listened to my Dad's advice &amp; just walked away.

      A few blogs ago, I mentioned how I emailed a local radio station in an assinine attempt to win $1025.00. Well, guess what folks? THEY PICKED ME! Yep.  Out of thousands of people in the Nashville area, they picked 5 people, myself included.   When I got the phone call, I thought it was one of my salesman playing a trick on me.  I said "Knock it off Paul & quit being a skank."  The man on the line replied "I beg your pardon Miss?" Doh!  He's legit!  I sank down in my chair, I started screaming, laughing, crying, shaking.  $1025.00 is quite a  sum of money for someone like me.  I wasn't going to blow it on food, beer, lavish parties or clothes.  I was going to buy Miles a really suped out playset.   That's right.  The wood kind with the swirly slide, fireman's pole, rockwall, swings, & monkey bars.  I've had it picked out for MONTHS I tell ya.  I eyeball it everytime I'm in HomeDepot.  This beast of a swingset costs close to $1200.oo  I immediatly start jumping up and down screaming "I WON! I WON!" Uh, nope.  I haven't won YET.  Damn that word "yet!"  For there are 4 others competing and I am not allowed to know what they are doing.   So I'm thinking "Eh, this should be a piece of cake." Everyone in the office immediatly starts a pool of cash for the ketchup/fries.  They root me on, pat me on the back, tell me I can find great wigs for cheap @ the salon. I also found out this: It's gonna be at the local racetrack (a redneck haven. I'm talking full force mullets for both sexes!) it's also going to be televised, radio-vised, oh and did I mention it's going to be in front of a crowd of thousands?  Mmmmhmmm. I told my girls w/ DSI that it's gonna look like a Porno gone bad. There's me, in my black bikini, in front of thousands of cut off T'shirts, big hair and dip all the while  getting a buzz cut, flailing around in a kiddie pool of ketchup and hitting a slip n slide of thawed out freedom fries.  Just call me "Gigi Roman" for cryin' out loud.  I got home and told RD.   His response was "Whatever you wanna do Babe."  Hmmph.  I'm about to shave off ALL my dark brown curly locks and that's all he can say? Well, after much thinking over numerous cups of java, I have decided not to go thru with it. Now don't go callin' me chicken shit or a weenie, because that I am not.  Yes, it is true this whole email contest started with a playset for my son.  But the more I thought about it, the more I was able to weigh out the pros/cons. On one hand  I lose all my hair and it takes months/years for it to grow back. The other? I get one bad ass playset for Miles and we become the most popular family on the block.  Honestly, I never thought they'd pick me.  EVER.  And yet they did.   I just don't have the balls to do it.  Sigh.  That's alright though.  I'll get that swingset soon and keep my locks in the process!

      I was talking to a good friend of mine this afternoon when we got into a slight tift. He was being his usual cocky self and said "If you would have answered your phone last night I would have given you the best conversation of your life! " PHAH! I replied, " That's ok, I talked to Steven instead!" Hahaha!  Of course I was kidding.  I don't/haven't talked to Steven in awhile. I also knew for fact that Hugh hadn't called me at home.  So Hugh gets mad and hangs up on me! The nerve!  I cannot stand people who can dish the shite all day long but can't take it when it's their turn. I immediatly called him right back to which he answered "Hello? Hello? Click."  Oh how childish! I called him back again and said "Hugh, quit being childish!" "Hello? Helllooooo?? GD! My phone isn't working! Click."   With a smirk on my face I hung up.  I was thinking Yeah, I gave you a good one, right in the ribs.  Who's the jokester now?!

      I KNEW IT! The turd is being stirred as we speak.  I swear oh I swear!  Dana is "mad" at me because I said maybe she shouldn't get married.  I'm sure she's spreading vicious rumors about me.  But the thing of it is, that comment wasn't a blatent one.  Like I walked right up to her and said: Hey Dana. You really shouldn't be married, get married again, or even consider it. I interjected into Pam's conversation about Dana NOT getting married.  I just agreed!!! And now I'm the bad guy? Bring it on wench.   Go ahead and try to burn my house down, drown my cat, front on my man.  I'm so fired up today anyway, I bet I could take her with one hand. OOOOOOHHUURGGHGH!!!  This job was so peaceful and normal.  Now it's back to the same ole crap. Jeez.

      Ok... For some bizarre reason, if this shows up underneath the "Dirty Blonde" then I don't know what I've done.  I wrote another piece and it showed up beneath what I did earlier... Hmm.. do you see the genius in me emerging?

      As of now, it is REALLY raining outside. I want to go home, crawl under the down blanket in my skivies and sleep all day.  This of course is all a big daydream, for here I sit, at my desk, on break rubbing my eyes & typing this.  I stayed up too late last night downloading a new ISP.  Earthlink wasn't cuttin' it for me.  In the middle of my conversation with #4 I got disconnected and spent the rest of the evening trying to figure out how to reconnect. What does Open Port mean? Simply this: Turn the computer off.  Turn it on.  Connect to the internet. Mmhmm. I'm not that quick with computers, so I was totally lost.  The "Help" key doesn't really "help" you much at all.  I think I need to enroll in a computer class.  Or just go home, crawl in bed in my skivies and sleeeeeeep for a few hours.

      For the record it's pouring down rain. I'm very very sleepy and my day is just beginning.   I'm only a half cup into the morning and I'm already daydreaming about my bed with the soft sheets, down comforter, fan on, window open....  ahhhh....... Why is it when it rains I always crave a nap?

       I did not know that:      1) Zoloft helps your headaches.     The person who informed me of this said this is fact b/c:      A. His wife suffers from headaches & takes Zoloft.     B. She doesn't give him head b/c she HAS headaches due to NOT taking her Zoloft       Isn't Zoloft for depression not headaches? See my intrigue?

      Strippers, for the most part do not scare me. The stripper who will be at a party I am attending next week does.   She will be working the same birthday party she did last year.   She's probably mid twenties (from far away) but definatly 31+ (up close).  Last year she wore shimmery lavender lipstick with Robert Smith like makeup & white chunky platforms.  Her hair was thin and long.   I was apprehensive to say the least.   All the men were having a blast, of course.  I was intrigued more than anything, standing quietly in the sidelines, taking it all in, thinking all the while: Did my parents go to parties like this?  That is, until my husband pushed me into her chair for a lap dance.  Oh Good Gosh!  Unfortunatly for me, there are pictures floating out there.  Yikes!! The pictures of me aren't bad at all.  Just me, in a chair, getting a lap dance by a seriously skanky woman with a look of sheer horror on my face. Then a coworker dumps a beer on my shirt and tries to lick it off me, then another tried to rip my shirt off. The photos are all there, in chronological order. Talk about feeling violated! After that I sat outside on the deck drinking Kool-Aid and wanting to leave ASAP.  So why bring all this up now in my blog?  The birthday party is next weekend.  My friend is on me: "Gotta sitter yet? You better get a sitter!"  Groan.  I really don't want to see the same stripper or become violated by another co-worker.  Even though my girl PROMISES this party will be different.  There will be LESS nudity or none all together. (Uh-huh. I work with these girls, there's ALWAYS nudity) . There will be door prizes , fun, games, Barbque and the stripper will only dance for the birthday boy.  It's one thing to witness a stripper birthday party with friends outside of work.  When the stripper party is WITH the people you work with that is something entirely different.  Monday morning is no longer what is should be.  And then of course, there is that ONE person who can't shut their trap and tells every little detail to random customers, salesman , etc.  Before you know it, some customer in Miami is calling saying: Sooooo, I hear you wear white cotton panties and have tattoos.  I shudder at the thought.

      I am officially having the best day this month! I'm in such a giggly crack myself up mood.  It's awesome I tell ya! ** Sharon and I were sitting in the breakroom/kitchen chowin on some lunch and we started really looking at all the photos in there.  In our breakroom we have one of those huge boards filled with photos of work functions (on & off the clock), Random salesman, pictures of jobsites &amp; the like.   As we were scanning I noticed this picture at the very top... and who could it be?( ha! I know what you're thinking & NO, not someone I know from high school!) but the Batcaver himself! He's standing next to one of our Florida guys.  That's the first picture I've seen of him where the clarity is good.  Most photos I've seen, he looms in the background, trying to remain hidden.   So Sharon and I were both like : Damn, that's the Batcaver? YUM!!! :) ** Today I'm pretty sure that there is something major I'm suppose to do, but I can't remember what it is.  It's pointless for me to have a daytimer because I'm really not a full fledged "professional".  I don't have endless meetings or travel dates.  So those things just collect reciepts , phone numbers and empty gum wrappers.  I am a bit freaked as to what I had planned today... it's bothering me.  Sigh.  Guess I'll figure it out when I get home. ** What else what else... I am in too good a mood to type anything ignorant (yknow: The house is dirty, I'm not getting laid, I need to clean out my closet, I lost my favorite Jack Johnson CD) So I'm just going to go back to work and finish crackin' myself , as well as those around me, up ! Choa~ J

Looking around my office, there are at least 2-3 that fit each catagory! oh the Horra'! :)  Enjoy! PS: NO! I am not the Super Parent (as of yet, for M doesn't play sports! ha!)

      There is a contest currently going on @ a local radio station.   I have decided to enter. The question is: What would you do to get $1025 dollars? Hmmmm.... Here's what I said:    I will sit real still & not cry as I let one of your interns give me a buzz cut.  To which I will then donate my hair to Locks of Love.  Then, I will jump into a giant vat of ketchup and then roll around in a huge mound of French Fries. ** I doubt I'll get picked.  I'm hopeful though.  I've already got the blessing from my man to get the buzzcut.  Hahaha.  I'm sure there's someone else in the metro area whose idea is way more out there than mine.  Probably some drunken redneck who will agree to get the DJ's name tattooed on his ass or something. It's gonna be a good day! :) **

      Oh my GOSH what a day! It has been the kind of  day that just consumes every little detail. Every thought you've thunk (ha!) has been devoured by a project. You feel like your head will collapse from overload.    I feel like I'm going to fall apart or worse go home and get drunk! Ha! Actually, I hear my big garden tub, Mr.Bubbles, candles & a glass of iced tea callin' my name tonite.  Oh yeah!!! ** Friday night, over dinner, my step brother asked me to be his assistant. I slightly hesitated and then struck him a deal.  I told him if he graduates, shows me his client list, that he's made a name for himself & oh yeah PAY me enough, I'd do it.  We shook on it. (no spit envolved).  This afternoon I was dreaming about that job.  To just have this kick ass chill job w/ my brother.   Booking appointments, meeting the stars, travelling all over the place.  Then I snapped out of it when my phone rang.  I wonder if he could do that.  Hmmm... he's asked me since day 1 to be his assistant.  I do know that I'm creative enough to help him do an updo on a few drag queens for extra dough, apply makeup heavily, and what size bra a 6'5 man wears. Ahhh, to dream . **

      I really want to sock it to my poet buddy.  He's getting a bit weird on me. All this talk about the shifting of the Earth, the white buffalo,  how man & nature are about to become one and the chosen ones will find the Red Road.  On and on and on he goes.  I'm lost in his vortex of mismatched ramblings.  I have no clue as to what he's talking about.   I remember the night he had this "enlightening" expierence.  Or when he told me about it rather.  We were at a Shoney's resturant right outside Nashville.   I had just moved back home from Japan and was looking forward to meeting up with him, drinking coffee and talking about the shit I'd expierenced.  Didn't happen.  I instead listened to him go on and on about some crazy expierence he had with lights and visions.  How he spoke to some "higher" thing.  Holy cow I thought, he's lost it.   Which, the ramblings have continued, much to my dismay.  Whatever will become of him? I think he's eating shrooms on a daily basis, that he's fallen off the "wagon" and gone back to drinkin and drugs.  I doubt it though.  Something has seriously come across his way that he can't leave alone.  I'm beginning to believe he's turning cult like.  He's freakin' me out.   Ah, but you know how it goes... To each his own.  I want to wish him well on his travels of the Red Road and never talk to him again.  But I won't.  Too much history, too  much friendship, too much intrigue.   So I'm hoping he'll enlighten me.  And I'll find my purpose, whichever it may be.

      Ok, so my girl Chris calls me at work this morning. I found her voicemail odd because she never really calls me at work unless it's to say she saw someone or to catch me up on some little bit of bullshit. I returned her call to hear her whining about Steven.  "Have you heard from him at all?"  she said.  " I have emailed him dozens of times, left voice messages, I've even contacted G! He hasn't even heard from him either. I thought maybe you had because y'all have talked a few times." I can hear the distress in her voice. This freaks me out for 2 reasons.   1)  Steven is NOT her boyfriend.  They are not dating exclusively or even on a slightly serious level.  2) Why am I the appointed go to girl? sigh.  So I tell her that I haven't heard from him.  Which, I haven't, in at least a week or so.  And to be honest, boy am I glad!!  It's one thing to become friends with a friend's friend.  But when that line gets crossed, like Steven did with me, I could give two shits less if I ever hear from him again.  I wanted to tell Chris that Steve thinks she's bonkers, a bit on the psychotic side, to quit mailing him letters, little presents & collages.  I didn't though.  Because the cover would have been blown that I know & I'm not suppose to. I hope that Steven never contacts me again.  I hope that Chris can see that he isn't interested.  I'm hoping all this because I just want, for once, to be out of the damn loop!!

      Tonight, I got rejected. Mmmhmm.. That's right, it's still possible to get rejected when married.  I, of course, being so young and ignorant, figured that doesn't happen until yknow, 46.  Errr Wrong!  I haven't really elaborated on my marriage with this blog.  Maybe I won't go into details tonight, because I feel pretty pissy & sad.   It has been a few weeks however since I've had a little R&R with my man.  I kept thinking : We have been extremely busy lately.  Well, tonight, I got home from my folks house, put M to bed & snuck into my bedroom. I scoot under the covers, press up against my husband thinking all the while how great it is to be with him, to love him, to just be able to enjoy laying next to him.   I get a little frisky and let us cue in the announcers: "Well Bob, she's going in for the over the side reach around.  Let's see how well it works for her tonight. Chris, I don't think this one is gonna work tonight.. yep yep! Look there !  OH! Denied! Was it her techinique? Bob I don't believe it! Rd does a tuck and roll!! Oh, the rejection must be unbearing. Chris, she looks a bit defeated. Notice how she quietly walks out of the room? If I was her I'd be slammin' the door."  So that's pretty much what happened.  I went for it and was greeted by the tuck and roll.  I go , defeated , to the back bedroom where I go online.  Hmmm.. I'm already connected.  This is where the light goes on... I hit the history button. TA DA! My man's been in a porn heaven all evening.  I've never had a problem with porn.  Magazines, movies, online, whatever.  It's never bugged me.  I can't figure that out either.  Maybe it has something to do with my parents' free spirits and never letting me think sex was horrid.   But I digress.. Tonight it pissed me off.  It's been WEEKS since I've gotten even a little tap on the ass from RD.  And what the heck is this? A plethora of a jillion sites. I was bummed. I was disappointed.  I was , well, I was sad.  So tonight I'll go to bed empty handed yet again. Sigh.

I'm going to take my broke ass camera up to the camera store & let them look &amp; see if it can be saved. (M dropped it in a cooler full of drinks last summer at a bbq!! I was so sad!!)  L8r s8r.

      I just got home and it's 3 A.M. I haven't driven home this late since college.  It felt kind of weird, being on the road that late and not a soul in site.  I passed the plant where my husband works and thought about popping in, but I don't even know where to find him in that place.  Well, I forgot I was taking my stepbrother out to dinner tonight.  So as I was getting ready to go to Sharon's he called. Awww hell!  I had to shuffle my schedule a bit, but I made it to meet him @ TGIFridays for drinks & dinner.   Afterwards, I headed over to Sharon's for a little girlie makeover/slumber party blah blah whatever. I got there and Juicy & Sharon are pretty lit.  It was only 8pm.  Figured I could get a few more hours of hang out time with them. Wrong. Juicy passed out around 10.  Curled up on her air mattress with Enya playing in the background, mumbling about how she misses her international boyfriend.  I hung out with Sharon & her man for a bit, that is, until Sharon disappeared.  I made it upstairs to check on her to find that she's passed out in her bed mumbling about how she never should have eaten that hot dog! I said: Sharon, how many martini's have you had tonite? "Oh, 6 or 7 I think" she said. Great.  I ended up falling asleep next to her watching Letterman.  Only to wake up at 2am.  Just wide awake.  Weird.  So after a brief struggle trying to find my jeans (I didn't want to wear her jammy pants home) I grabbed my purse & keys and hit the open road. I'm feeling like I should just give up on Friday nights all together and have my folks keep M on Saturdays.  Well, I guess I'm gonna try to get the rest of my sleep in. M won't be home till 4 pm tomorrow.  I think I'll set my alarm and take RD to Waffle House in the morning when he gets home.  Till then! J

      Oh another 15 to go... I feel like those 15 will never get here and I'll be stuck in pergatory. I am getting a major sinus headache over my right eye.  I've popped 2 extra strengthy Tylenol and I'm hoping it's gone before I head out this evening.  So I've also noticed that NDN is posting some seriously risque comments on my blogs.  Naughty Naughty NDN!! Ahhh whatever!!  They make me smile & also give me a new look as to what I type.  You know you're tha' man NDN!  This day has been extremely slow.  It feels like a holiday weekend or something.  No calls, no orders, blah blah blah kinda DAY! Man!! Almost over though, so I should quit my bitchin'.  I'm outta here!! Peas!

      I have a strong dislike for our UPS guy.  Since day one in this office he & I have gone round and round.  At first I think he would jump out from behind doors, corners & his truck because he thought it was funny.  He quit doing that after I cussed him out like the little wench he truly is.  Oh, and I drew a naked guy picture on the side of his truck too with a caption that said: "Boys wanted, inquire with driver!" I'm sure that went over real well with his superiors.  He & I have never gotten along and I'm almost tempted to ask him if he's a Pisces or a Taurus.   So anyway,  now that Dana is back in our office from her short 7 month tryst with trying to live an "adult" life, he comes into our office more.  Dana sits right in front of me, and I swear, if he says one thing to me, I lose it.  He makes me sick, honestly!  I say this because he just left our office & I felt sick when I saw him. He just looked at me and in his whiny Southern twang " Seeeee yewwww J.  Yewwww 'having yewself?"  ugh.  Gag me.  One time, I was waiting for a package to come in from my good friend Howie.  This jerk comes in and says "J is your last name ____?"  "Yeah, what about it?" I said.  He then proceeded to KICK my BOX off his dolly cart.  It wasn't a little kick to get it off the cart onto the floor either.  He kicked it as hard as he could.  I know this because I was standing in an office across a hallway from where he was and it landed at my FEET. Jerk. Luckily it was nothing that could have been broken.  But I seriously thought about calling UPS and sayin yknow what? This loser you've got on our route needs to go. He's a greaseball, he drives me mad on my break, attempts to run my car over on the street, he's kicked my package oh, and you might want to remind him about that sexual harrassment memo yall have.   I like the FedEx guy better.  He's tall, tan, & extremely professional. I'll be sending it all FedEx from now on rather than have that turd ship my package!!

      My day is moving along like a Sloth. Thank you Hurricanes Bonnie & Charley.  Typically Friday's are fairly slow in our office anyway.  It gives us gals a chance to catch up on tossing the papers off our desk, gossiping, giving facials , catching up on whatever all between our phone calls.   Today? I feel like I've been here for 10 hrs.  It's a slow hell.  The phones aren't ringing, there are no orders, we've helped all other members in the office, so here we sit.  And sit.  And SIT. Good Lord, it's only 12:45!!! I've got another 3 hrs to go! Groan.  So I figured I'd sneak a few random thoughts on here.  ;)  On lunch today Sharon & I kicked it over to Big Lots.  Damn I love that place. I got myself this little black tank top w/ speghetti straps and a super cute pair of white panties that have a fake "secret"  pocket on the front. Yknow how boys have those on the tighty whities? It's like that, except it doesn't open! Ah, I know.  Nothing a little seam ripper can't fix. hahaha.  Tonight I have an overnight sitter for M.  My husband has to work though.  So there won't be an exciting date night or anything. However, I am going over to Sharon's house.  We've decided we'll give one another pedicures, facials, girlie crap.  We'll probably drink a few martinis & end up watching movies in our undies.  I love having girlie nights!

      Every woman knows the importance of looking nice at the most inconvient times.   This is why you see us apply a dab of lipstick, fluff our hair, smooth our clothes & spray a bit of perfume before we head out the door.  Even if it's going to , oh, say the grocery store. I skipped those steps tonight. BIIIIIG MISTAKE!!!  I had to run up to Kroger tonight to get some food for a shin dig we're having at the office.  Leave it to me.  I'm always the one , who, the night before remembers, to their dismay, the office party. Damn it!! So I usually bring breakfast.  I got burnt out on eating 7 layer dip, Swedish meatballs & the like around 8am, so I always bring the coffee cake.  As I'm walking twards the milk, I sort of zone out.  I'm people watching, yknow, so I have something interesting to say on this blog.  And I catch a glimpse of this girl in a red shirt, skin tight jeans & high heels.   I suddenly think: She followed the rules! Then, as I'm swinging the door closed to the milk cooler I catch a glimpse of my own self... aww jeez.  Overalls, tank top, flip flops, I've got the bottom of my pants rolled up like I've been kickin' in the creek & my hair is a mess.  Hell, I've still got my sunglasses on my head and it's 8pm!  But I digress... When I turn around to get into the checkout line, that girl in the red shirt turns to me and says: J! What the HELL girl!!  Holy cow.  It's someone I know.  Someone I haven't seen in ages, someone who looks georgeous at the freakin' grocery store.  That someone is  Sandra. And guess what?? Sandra lives up the street from me too!! With her live in boyfriend ERIC who also happens to have gone to school with us.  (It gets better...)  These are the things I found out tonight: 1. Rooster married Jenny.  A. The wedding was at Rippavilla  B.  Mainly Rooster's family came  C. It was insanely expensive 2. They spent ALOT of money fixing up the Villa & they now live there. (L, if your'e reading, the Villa was that run down shack right down the street from PHS & right next to Cotton's market. The one with the big concrete porch on the front. Next time your in town, take a peek!) 3. Aaron &amp; Carrie live in our neighborhood. 4. So does Aarons brother. (3 & 4 I found out from Bill the previous night) 5. She's seen Ana &amp; Randy and those two look the same. 6. She still hangs out with Erin.  As she's talking to me, I zone out again.  Because I'm standing in Kroger, looking like ass, holding a gallon of milk & a coffee cake.  I also realize that I live in a very very small world.  I now know why people escape small towns, why they never return, why they don't go to highschool reunions & why they smartened up. I had an ephipany. If my husband had been awake when I got home I would have begged him to pack our bags & move ANYWHERE BUT HERE. It's fun to see folks, but dang, it's getting a bit bizarre! For cryin' out loud, I could put flyers out in my neighborhood about a Keg party for PHS and there wouldn't have to be a reunion, because shit, everyone LIVES in my neighborhood!  The insanity, I swear!

      While I was talking to #4 he brought up how he saw an actual, full frontal titty shot on cable. I had to catch my drink in my hand. Maybe it was the way he said it.  Maybe the thought of him, laid out in his boxers, work shirt still on & flipping channels that caught me off guard.  I told him" 4, you're showing your age!"  He replied: "NO! It was a good thing, they need more of it on TV!" So I'm thinking he probably caught an episode of plastic surgery on Discovery Channel.  It wasn't TLC I know that! Remember when TLC was cool like that and had awesome programming? Not anymore.  It's all that Home Improvement/Trading Spaces shit.  Honestly, there are only so many episodes of Trading Spaces I can handle before I think" Yknow, Amy Wyn bought that shit at Kmart. This show blows."  So anyway, 4 got me to thinking... Of all the crazy B line nudity on TV.  There really is alot of it.  I remember my parents freaking out about the episode of NYPD Blue where they actually showed Bobby's ass.  That was TV.  They broke the mold with that show. I can recall my parents letting us watch it because it was "ground breaking" television.  And then feeling all weird about it b/c I had to watch it with my folks. I still feel that way when I watch 6 ft under @ my Dad's.  The whole sex issue on that show is fine, watching it w/ my Dad isn't.   But really, it doesn't leave to much to the imagination.  That could work both ways.  Good & Bad. Good for all those preteen boys who want to see more of Brittney, Ashley &amp; Jessica Simpson and whatever Pop Star Princess is popular that week & secretly run off for the bathroom.  Bad for us new mommies who think: OH MY GOSH! Turn that crap off!!! You're eyes will fall out of your skull!! I can remember my folks making me leave the room when VanHalens video "Jump" came on MTV b/c David Lee Roth stuck his crotch in the camera.  I can vividly recall standing at the top of the steps and hearing my dad say: SEE! Right there! He stuck his dick in front of the camera! What the heck?! I'm laughing right now, because when I think of that, my Dad was MY age when that happened. Whoa.  I wonder if 4 saw a nice rack or not.  Hmm.  If it was a "surgery" show I bet it wasn't all that great.  Apparently it really made his night.  4 you crack me up.  Oh, wait... "You make me laugh" Isn't that how it's said? Haha. No 4... YOU make ME laugh.  I could type something totally off the wall for your little voyeristic pleasure, but I won't. I'll save it. Till next time America. J PS: Anyone remember the show that "Till Next Time America" came off of? It was my fave. ;)

      Yet again I saw Mr. Pink while on lunch. Thankfully, it was only in passing. He did his usual 3 finger wave in the air.  I cracked a smile in the car, because, well, I guess that's an inside joke between he & I and I can't believe he remembered it after all this time. And to see him actually do it, that made it solid.  For a moment I almost felt a twinge of liking him again.  Then all of a sudden I snapped out of it.  Thinking all the while : "What?" and shaking myself from the vision.  The whole thing lasted maybe 2 seconds.  Glad that was over.

      NDN left me a voicemail yesturday wanting to know what I was wearing. I contimplated this for a moment while I let the redness in my cheeks subside. Isn't he cute? Wanting to know what I'm wearing!  Well, considering I work in an office, you can bet I'm not sporting a mini skirt and a skimpy shirt! I told him I had on bellbottom jeans and a light blue tshirt.  I think that sufficed, he seemed pleased with my answer, and then said he wished he was my jeans. Silly NDN!!!  Yknow, just once I'd like to take a trip up to see NDN.  I think it would be productive, don't you NDN?

      Last night I was talking to #4.  * I won't use #4's name & I can't figure out a good nickname for him...  so since he was the 4th voicemail I got the other day, this will have to suffice* So... We were chatting & he's wanting to know where all the sex is on my blog.  Hmmm. Well... Sex & Scandals do go hand -n- hand I suppose.  I have alot of crazy stories, not too many scandals.  And sex, well #4, in order to have great sex stories, you have to HAVE sex right? Yeah, there's a serious drought going on in my house right now.  I'm not going to push the issue either.  I'm always the instigator, the begger, pleader, I'll do a favor for a quickie CMON PLEASE?! Kind of spouse.   I've bought my fair share of "cute" bedroom outfits.  The most recent one I really like.  A pin striped top & matching thong w/ pink ruffles on the front and back.   My man said it was "cute" and I shoved it to the back of my drawer.   There's just been too much going on recently for us to think about it.  Well, I think about it, maybe he doesn't.   #4, I will try to put more amazing sex stories on here.  If not from me, from one of my coworkers, my brother, the guy at the gas station... who ever. ;) And just so you know, it may be B line movie sex, so don't come bitchin' if it's not to your likin'! hahah! I'm teasing of course.  I am hating the drought though.  When a woman feels the drought coming on we automatically think something is amiss.   I've thought: Does he not like my hair? (He said he loved it.) Am I getting a little to thick for him (I've lost 7lbs)  Is he pissed I didn't clean the kitchen?(Even though I vaccuumed instead.) So, I may be madly in love, but I'm sufferin the wrath in the bed.  Oh to dream and remember the days of Marathon Sex.

      Ok... When I'm talking to someone and I say "Oh that happened back in the day." And that person replies: How long ago was that J? Like 4 years ago? You're too young to have a "Back in the day!"  I CAN'T STAND IT!!!! If I say something happened 10 years ago... IT DID.  10 years is 10 years.  But I guess when you hit 30, that's when it's ok to reference the "10 year, 5 year" thing.  Next time I hear it I'm gonna slam the phone down and hold a strike. :)

      I've got a bit before I come back from lunch, so I'm just going to type out all my random thoughts.  I talked to Steven yesturday.  He's seriously freaked out by my girl C.  I guess she's sending him letters, cards, pictures and gifts.  So many, that he said he just quit opening them.  "What do I do J?!"  Hell, I dunno.  Just because we're pals doesn't mean I have the answers.  I told him:" Tell her your gay" Aside from that comment being A) slightly on the rude side and B) stereotypical I figured it would work.  Hell, it worked for me.... well, actually it was truth.  I did catch my college boyfriend in the "HUT" position with another man. Sigh. Damn shame too, he was hot.  So,  I never knew C was such a nutcase.  She and I are pals, but I guess not the "you tell me your secret I'll tell you mine" kind of pals.  That brought into a whole new light why she's only had 1 boyfriend since I've known her.... hmm.... she does appear to be a bit neuratic & overly possessive at times.  I'll be damned!  I also came upon a guilty pleasure snip it in an old article of Entertainment Weekly.  V.C. Andrews Flowers In The Attic.   I remember seeing that book on my mom's bookshelf and always being creeped out by the cover.   When I was living in Japan, I picked up her novels & got sucked into her world.  I read every single book written by her.  What else did I have to do? RD was out to sea, I didn't own a TV and I was 5 months pregnant.  So I read.  ALOT.  I also played chess @ my favorite cafe w/ a gay Japanese guy who wore Daisy Dukes & hot pink shirts.  Such is my life.  Those are some damn good memories.  I miss Japan.  Oh, and my poet friend has returned from hiding.  I got an email from him.  He is so far gone mentally that I can't even comprehend his damn emails.  Something about following the Red Road, Piraigm(sp) and basically the end of earth. But not to fret! he says! For we are friends.  Is that suppose to make me feel better? That because he & I are pals I don't have to fear the end of the Earth? Hmm.  He's a fruitcake.  I wonder if he's fallen off the wagon.  I'd like to get my damn poetry back so I can submit it, publish it and become filthy rich.  :)  That's such a dream isn't it?  I'd love publish my novel.  But I look at all those pages mounting up in their secret hiding spot and realize: I'm a slacker.  It would take the grace of God or bumping into a trendy famous person to get it published.  Sigh. That's ok.  Every now and then I really hop on it, get the juices flowing and think: This is IT! I'm really going to make this happen! Then I have some kind of glich in my system and I burn out.  Stuff those papers away and go play with play-doh, pretend I'm a pirate or bounce a tennis ball off our barn w/ M. I enjoy that more.  I also recieved a call from my lunatic Aunt last night.  Well, she's not a lunatic ALL the time.  She was bitching me out for skipping out on a Friday night sleepover with her.  Eh, big deal.  I always say I'll come over and never do.  I just don't want the drama.  But she's more like a sister than an Aunt anyway.  She taught me the ways of a woman.  Maybe all the stuff I shouldn't have been learning between the ages of 18-20.  I was close to getting a little action w/ my man last night and I actually ANSWERED the phone. Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Everytime I tried to get her off the phone she broke into another story.  RD finally just passed out.  Bummer.  Maybe I'll strike it rich tonite.  :)  Also, the time is close approaching for my Mom's visit.  She and her girlfriend are coming into town for Labor Day.  I'm hoping for a peaceful 6 days.  This will be the first time I've met my mom's girlfriend, even though they've been together 3 years now.  I told her: Now you know how I felt when you guys made me bring my dates home.  Great feeling huh?  What's that? You'd rather vomit? Yeah, it's that great. So I'm sure around September I'll have some great stories.  My mom is wanting me to take her & her girlfriend to this gay bar in Nashville where they have Drag shows.  That will probably require me to take a couple shots of Jager or something... and I don't drink.... so that says alot.  I asked RD if I should go to therapy... he said that would make it worse.  haha. So that's why I started my site.  Sigh... my mom is a lesbian.  What are the ODDS!!! Good gosh.  I shake my head in disbelief at how I am so normal.  Back to work! Happy reading! Love, J

      Yknow, sometimes I really hate being a chick.  I've been sucked into this "she said/she said" crap lately.   One person I know can ruin my entire outlook for about an hour or so.  She can sour my mood in a matter of minutes.  Rediculous, I know.  Frankly I could care less if I ever talked to this petty woman again.  Alas, I must keep the peace.    Isn't that odd how we tolerate certain people & their quirky behaviors for whatever reason? I mean really, what's the point?  Why do I smile at her when I'd rather DDT her? I can't hold a decent conversation with her anymore.  She's so wrapped up in her own little soap opera world.  I know I have a slight soap opera going on, but good gosh! I don't hold a candle to her.  She makes Springer look like Oprah. I just nod my head in agreement with whatever she says.  Before the fact, I was always in the mix. "YEAH! Kick her ass!" "Yeah! You're man is an idiot, pack his bags!"  "Oh, it's no big deal that your thong is hanging out of your skin tight jeans, really."  Shit like that is just the surface.   It went from simple girl conversation to watching her stab my friends in the back and then pouring salt in the wound.  "I can't stand ____ .  She is such a bitch. I wish she'd get off her high horse" she'd say. " Did you know her husband sleeps around on her?"   Then it snowballed to " Why are you friends with her? Yknow she said you're fat right?"  Please.  If I'm not fat! If I'm lyin I'm dyin, and I'm still standing here!!!! Now? I ignore it.  I removed myself from the situation & snotty-ness. I'm over it , really.  I feel like the middle man for Pete's sake!  I'm headed out!!! G'nite! G'day! Good Ridence to bad people!! :)

      When I got home yesturday,  I realized I didn't have my house key. Awww Damnit. So my son, M, took it upon himself to ring the doorbell about 50 times.  My husband staggers to the door and as I have an armful of mail, Abby escapes.   I blame her darting for the door on my husband.  She never looked twice at the front door until he took her outside.  Now it's like a game of Beat the Clock.  I throw the mail into the living room, hitting my husband in the back of the head (TOTAL accident I swear) toss my purse down and run after that stupid cat.  So our evening didn't start off to well.   Then RD starts speed cleaning when all I wanna do is take my work clothes off, put on a pair of shorts and my fave skater tshirt and watch the news.  It didn't happen.  Eventually after supper, fighting over the dental bill, fighting with M to pick up his room, a few rounds of baseball in the backyard, I had to get away.  Call it mental clarity, escapism, whatever.  I also had to pick up my house key from my Dad.  I noticed a few weeks ago, that we got some new neighbors 4 doors down.  As I'm driving past that house I hear " J!!!" really loud.  I slam on the breaks, look to my left and who do I see? SOMEONE I KNOW!!! (I know, get the hell outta here right?)  It's Bill, from highschool!  I get out, we chat & whatnot.  He tells me that Erick & Sandra live down the street, Aaron &amp; Carrie do too.  Wierd.  He said he told his new wife the other day: I wonder what happend to J M? Well, here I am, living 4 doors down.  Crazy.  On top of it all, I want to enroll M in Spanish class at school.  It's $75.00 a month and RD thinks it's ignorant.  How can that be?? I mean, hello!! Spanish will be taught as a second language anyway!  I'm glad I know Spanish.  If I didn't I wouldn't be able to communicate with half the people I meet everyday.  Lord! So I mention it to my dad & now he's wanting to pay for it.   That's not going to go over well with my husband.  It's not that I can't afford 75.00 a month either.  On one hand I've got my husband jumpin down my throat about NOT doing this & then my dad on the other bitching at me TO do it.  Ugh. I think I'm secretly going to run away to Bora Bora.  :) I'm off to work! J

      I want to give props to my one & only credit card company. It's actually a Dental Credit Card.  Because my credit is so good, I have an insanely high credit limit.  I mean, really, how could I possibly get 10,000$ worth of dental work done? (watch, today, I'll fall at the fax machine and knock out 4 teeth).  Anyway, My husband begins to freak out over all these statements/bills/blah blah blah.   We fight about it, oh, for 5 hrs last night.   Finally, I had to just jump up and say: I"LL TAKE CARE OF IT!!! sheesh.  So, I figure I'm taking on the daunting task of pressing 1 for English, 8 to repeat the menu because #2 option is what I need but I pressed #5 etc etc.  Not the case!! I had a live body on the phone within 3 minutes and BAM. Account matters are straight.  "Thank you Mrs _____ for choosing us!"  You betcha!  My man will be proud! On with the day I say!

      This afternoon when I got back from break I had 6 voicemails.  How is that possible? Do those 6 people HAVE to talk to me asap as stated? No.  Is it super important? Probably not.  Considering the fact that I was headed out of work right before I got all those voicemails, I left 'em.   They'll be there tomorrow.... I did however crack a serious smile to voice mail #4.   #4 was just "checking up on me" to make sure I was doing ok and to let me know I wasn't forgotten.  How special am I?! Oh, for such a shit Monday, that really made me smile.  #4, if you are reading this tonight, thank you.  Thank you for brightening my day and then doing a follow up call & letting me ramble about my perils in Hiram, GA, my crazy family (either by marriage or blood) and typical me shit.  It felt like the ole days.

      Ah ... I am gold toothless!  I was so excited to see that porcelien beauty today! :) I was also scared shitless when that assistant started yanking on my temporary with out any novacaine. OWWW! After arriving 14 min early and waiting an hour to go to the back, I was seated.  Waited another 20 minutes and here comes Ms. Priss.  "Now, Mrs ______ we don't typically use numbing medicine when applying  a crown. "  My face must've gone ashen.   She started yaknin on that thing and WHOOOOO WEEEE!!! I thought I was gonna come up outta that chair and bitch slap her. "Oh my.  Did that hurt?" she said.  Did it hurt? Do you see my eyes watering and my nose twitching? YES! It did as a matter of fact! She went and got Dr. Tooth, who so graciously jammed a huge needle in my jaw and filled it up with the goods. Thank goodness!!! He shot me up with some novacaine and all was right as rain in my world.  I don't see how anyone could have survived that ordeal without drugs of somesort.  The way they were tugging, pulling and pushing on me jaw?! ugh!!!  So I now have a nice, normal, non cavity tooth.  I'm still bummed I had to get a crown.  I'm also bummed I didn't get a gold tooth.  hahah.  I was actually looking forward to it.  I think it would have been a great conversational piece around the holidays.  Sigh.  Maybe next time!

      I think my niceness let someone cross lines with me. First off, Mr. Jersey Shore is getting a little too up close & personal with me.  My sis & I were discussing it on our way to Little Five Points.  We're headin down 285 during mid day traffic (which boggles me, MID day traffic, crazy!) I've got my eyes closed b/c everytime I look at her driving I get sick & I lean over and tell her all about Steven.   Steven.  The dark haired, blue eyed, drop dead gorgeous friend of a friend.  Well, he's overstepping his boundaries with me.  YES there are boundaries for me, believe it or not.   I thought, hey! I'll just chat it up with him, since he's moving to town n' all.  Plus, he's G's bestest friend.  He's also shacking up with MY bestest friend.  So where's the delima?  Steven is wanting to meet up with me. Secretly. Alone. Unattended.  And it's not for coffee and talk.   Out of the blue at that!!! I mean, here we chat for a day or so during a funeral and of course I think he's nice looking, but I never said it.   He emailed me a couple days ago, I replied and by his 3rd reply he's asking me to meet him at the Ramada when he's in town.  WHAT?!  I think I was too nice.  How could I have not been nice though?  I asked him: What the F*#& Steven, you're movin' way off the map. He replied: Us eastern boys move fast babe.  When I see something I want, I go for it.  Everything about you interests me.  I wish I bugged G about you more 5 years ago.  Good Gosh A'mighty.

      I have to keep biting my tongue today. Many people are pissing me off.  I'm not too sure why that is.  Hmm.  "Uh-oh... Looks like somebody has a case of the Mundays! " Yes, that is correct.  Here's to you Mr. When Will I Get My Delivery?   For calling me, religiously, on the 8's & keeping me on my toes. (It's not like I haven't called the dispatcher 18 times already) Here's to you Ms. I Don't Understand Your Manual!  For calling me 12 seconds before I go on break.  For you, I have another 25 minutes to explain it all, complete with demensions. Here's to you Mr.What The Hell Is My Pricing & Mr. I Don't Have An Account!  I can only repeat : CALL YOUR AGENT so many times before I give up the fight and highball you a number.  Here's to my Monday.  BEAT IT!

      I just want to type this blip before I head off to bed.  I am madly in love with my husband.  I mean, I am moved by this love.  It's close to a huge light shining on me, a choir, fireworks, whatever, it's awesome. I have always loved my husband.  Somewhere between all this drama the past 4 days, I stopped and looked at him.  As he walked up close to me and held my hand for hours while we sat at a funeral home in some hick town, I leaned over and said:  "Babe, I am madly in love with you." He blushed and said: "I know." I had to tell him... No, it's different.  When I look at you I get a rush of warmth all over my body, I blush, my hands get sweaty.... My husband looked at me again and said " OH my GOD. Are you pregnant? "

      For the past 4 days I have been travelling between Kennesaw & Hiram Georgia.  Back and forth, to and fro.  While at work on Wednesday, I recieved the call I had been anticipating.  That my husbands Granny had passed on.   Not that this was a shock, we were all expecting it.   I left work in a rush , dropped M off @ my dad's, and hit the road. The days that followed were such a blur.  A mix of laughter, sadness, utter shock & disbelief.  Upon first arrival at my brother in laws , it felt like a typical weekend trip.  Yet I spent the next two days at a funeral home in a small town called Hiram.  The name itself reminded me of some biblical city with gypsies in gold jewlery.   It was far from that.   Funerals in the South are far, far different from anything I've ever expierenced.  There was a whole seperate room where Granny was.  She was  laid out in perfect splendor in her favorite turquoise dress, resting peacefully in a mauve colored casket with roses.  As I entered that room I was so taken aback that I let out a huge GASP and almost fainted.   I don't know what I was expecting to see.  Every funeral I've been to has always been in a chapel... not a seperate room.  Aside from seeing Granny in her final resting, I was more taken aback by the sight of her daughter, Carol, talking very loudly from her cell phone.  IN FRONT OF THE CASKET.  C'mon, was that really nessecary?  And as Paw Paw left the Casket, crying, she ignored him.  IGNORED.  Her own FATHER.   I swear!!  Carol herself is a whole different species.  She is my father in laws STEP sister.  She's pushing the 400lbs mark, has 34 cats, a badly permed mullet and is a shop a holic. She also has a very very scary husband , Barry.  Barry & Carol do not live together &amp; never have.  He resembles the man that makes you ask for a security guard to escort you to your car, the one who has pedephile written all over him, the one who, well... is so short those bricks he'll never make a load.   SO,  She as well as her brother David, had bankrupted Granny & Paw Paw.  So when the time came to write that check at the funeral home, there was NO money.  None , nada.  I mean, oh I was so sad.  The whole weekend was everyone talkin' shit about Carol, David & Barry. Talkin' about how Paw Paw was all alone after 57 years.  Talk this , Talk that. My brother in law, Scott, who is the big "christian" in the group almost beat down Barry's ass in funeral home parking lot.  I was overwhelmed to say the least.  I learned after Thursday night to never be left alone... that way no one could corner me and use me as the pulpit.  Sigh. But I survived.  And I will have to finish the rest of this episode later.  I've got an early day. Hope you don't mind me cliff hanging.  :)

      I have a million things running thru my head today.  NDN is headed to Louisville this month.  I'd like to meet him up there, maybe have dinner and drinks.  Maybe take in some Jazz , go over some cool conversation and what not.  It's been awhile since I've been to Louisville...  wonder if NDN would mind the company? The last time I was there my boyfriend and I got this huge suite that over looked the river.  Very hip place.  I also want to beat down my old poet buddy.   He hasn't contacted me in almost 2 months.  He has everything I've ever written in a nice, neat little folder.  It also has the critiques of 2 publishers on it.  He better not have claimed it as his own and run off to make a fourtune.  Although I think it would be quite humorous to read a poem by a 46 year old , dried up, burnt out hippie talking about feeling your secret lovers fingers underneath the band of your panties.  There's something amiss about my day.  I'm in such an odd mood.  My horoscope today told me to make NO apologies for anything I encounter, say or do today.  Awesome!  I may have to throw my cards tonight to see what's up.  Is it a full moon... I don't know, my calander doesn't say?  I've also been thinking about how angry this comment makes me: "You've missed out on so much of your life." This comment is made when people find out these things about me: A) I'm 25. B) I've been married 5 years C) I have a son who is almost 4. Give me a break.  True, at certain times when my girlfriends go out or have exotic travels and sex I get a twinge of jealousy. But that's a given with any woman I think.   I don't feel like I've missed out... I've been to Europe, lived in Asia, lived on my own, became my own boss, got hitched and had a baby.  It's called LIFE.  I love my family. I love my son and seeing how awesome the world is thru his eyes.   Maybe that's why my moods off.   Yknow, now that I think about it... that IS why.  Someone made that comment to me... it was the jerk off who I hung up on this morning.  PRECIATE IT! I'm fixin to go to lunch... so it'll be ok. :)

      I just recieved an email that said I was a "Sweet & Sexy Southern Chick."  I hate to burst that guys bubble but A) I'm not always sweet and B) I'm really not Southern.  Ohwell.  The thought that counts, ay?  Of course it is!  That email was from the Jersey Shore.  Tsk Tsk.  I know!  I figured I'd make myself part of the welcoming committe for Steven.  Why not? Everyone else is looking forward to his move.   I doubt I'll see him for more than 4 minutes once he arrives in the state.  So I wrote back. Nothing major, nothing flirty, just regular ole stuff.   He did want to know why G never introduced us before I met my husband! Oh surely you JEST!!! I couldnt' believe he'd say such a thing! Well, yes I could.  So I'm not going to persue that comment or Steven, because c'mon... does it really take a brainac to figure out where it would lead?  I can't do that. But I do think it was nice of him to note I was Sweet & Sexy.  Made me think of Sweet & Sour Chicken... maybe that's who I really am. Sweet &amp; Sour.  Eh, aren't most women? :)

      I thought my day was going fairly well. Apparently other people think differently.   Earlier in the morning I was talking to a certain fellow who called me out. " OH J, quit being such a bitch!" he said. What? I'm being a bitch? Oh, that's right.... you can't handle the fact that I'm a bit dreamy today.  I'm so sick of this fellow.  Everything has gotten so complex with him.   Our conversations can't even be normal anymore.   Normal.  Now there's a word I used to be familiar with.  How is it that I can't live a Normal existance?  Oh, I'm sure I just bring it on myself, that's all.    I swanee to God if he calls me anymore today I'm going to have to let him go.  I don't have time for his pettiness or his games. He should just go whine to his wife about all his bullshit.  Hell, that's why he married her, right?  Sigh.... Things will be better by lunch... hopefully

        I am starting my blog over.      I tried to rename it, rehide it, re whatever & I was still found out. My creative outlet had been seriously limited.      Now I am free to write and speak as I please.      THANK GOODNESS!          There are just a few folks who I know that have the address. To those folks I'd like to say that I wouldn't have shared if I didn't trust you &amp; your opinions.      I finally can let my hair down (even though I cut it).      The previous blog about the Jersey Shore I brought over from the old blog.          Thanks for stickin' around.      J

      Tuesday, August 03, 2004    I just got off the phone w/ Steven from the Jersey Shore. He's the one I met @ the funeral of G's brother. The one who was Italian, with dark hair & blue eyes &amp; fiercely handsome. The one who said he could love me forever with my muddled Southern accent. (Which I wasn't aware I had one!) The one who's simply occupied my thoughts in and out for the past couple of weeks. My oh my. Steven , Steven, Steven. We chatted on and off about regular stuff. The whole thing felt almost suffocating. Maybe it's because we were both laughing so hard. Anyway, Steven is moving to our town. He is moving closer than what I thought he was. He gave me all his vital info &amp; I returned the favor (minus the home #). Oh go on and throw your 2 cents in. I felt the devilish part of me creeping closer to the front. I didn't supress it, hide it, chide it, scold it or damn it to hell. None of the above. I welcomed it as a breath of fresh air. The little Devil in me has slightly returned.
