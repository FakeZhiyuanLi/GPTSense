               This is has been a long time since I've posted in this blog, so there is a lot to recap.  OK because I Have horrible memory Im going to go through all the things worth mentioning that has happened in the past few weeks, ENJOY!!!            Ummmmm, where to start, On Tuesday (yesterday) I went to play laser tag with some friends and it was awesome, cept for the fact that i didnt come in first at all. ;p See, the thing is that the last time we went to laser tag I scored like 1,000 points in one game and got like the record of the month (I have the score card taped on my wall for all you non-believers), and this time my high score was like 762 or something, IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!  During the game there was some annoying people that should have been shanked (Kat wouldnt let me, so I shanked her) and made the game slightly less fun.  There was this little mehican boy/girl that kept following me and pulling on my gun, me being smart and having some pent up rage, I followed it and scared the little shemale right out of its punky little socks.  Score one for those people who dont like kids!!!! WOOHOO.  Ummm, on the way home, my friend nathan had his little apple-head chuaua doggie, named Poco in the car and seeing as how i love little kitties I set down my soda and scooped up the little ball of joy.  See, untill Kat said something about the whereabouts of my soda I was happy, content, and in perfect bliss, but then after she said, "Yo sup wheres ya soda pap", (paraphrased) I didnt quite know exactly and then i felt some wetness on my legs and for some reason hoped it was the dog and not my soda (i dont know either).  It was the soda.  I passed the dog off to Nathan and he's like, "Why is the dog sticky?" I pretended not to hear him, hehehehhehee SUCKER!!!

                 Hello everybody it saturday and im actually getting ready to make a grilled cheese sandwitch (or sandwhich).  Well today im babysittin at my usual spot (a huge western style mansion!!!)  and it should be fun, some major cash to be had.  It can give me a chance to finally play Gunbound (the best game ever), Neverwinter Nights (another great online game) and Wolfenstein (awesome possum game).             Last night I emailed my cell phone a buncha new ringers, there was bring me to life by evanescense, trouble by coldplay, and the Zelda theme from Super Smash Bro. Melee. and i also got some new wallpaper for it, an Anya one where she has a sword and looks wicked cool and one of her in her Bunny Suit that says, "Your no bunny, till some bunny loves you," and another of anya (big surprise) and xander with a very cool lookin backround (all blue and such).              OK recently i got the new switchfoot CD with Kat and Garrett and it awesome, i love it.  Some really good songs on it are 24, the beautiful letdown, and meant to live.  Those are my fav's as of now.  Im listening to Dido: life for rent and its sad but good.  My friend Kat and I both love Mary's in India, its a sad song about love lost and new love found, BOOOHOOO.             Well i better jet because i need to finish cleaning my room (from my spanish project, lotsa cardboard scraps).  Talk ta yall later!!!

      yea          HELLA ALL!!! This is my first post and im starting it cause my friend Kat did one (but shes the follower) and hers was cool.  This is also to show up my friend Garrett that it is not that hard to set up a blog (if you have a brain).  Just kidding, anyway.............                                                      This whole week has been one giant stress ball of poop ( yes poop ) cause i kinda procrastinated on two projects until the last few days they were due.  YIKES never do that.  They were spanish and AP European HIstory.  With Spanish I had to make a house and label all the things in Spanish like refigerator would be el refrigerador (el re-free-hair-a-door)  and such.  I totally out did everybody in my class on it, i built a 3-D model out of cardboard and painted it various colors.  WOOOHOOO Colors.  anyway, my letter that i had to do with it rocked as well.  My teacher (very cool) said that mine was the best that she has seen and that I'm gonna get extra points!!!! Which i better get more points because i spent 3 days straight doing it.  I went to bed at like 1 am every night.  For Euro I had to do 80 key terms.  Doing like 20 takes like and hour and a half, i waited till the day they were do.  HAHAHAHHA figures.  took all night like 8 hours. Gonna post more later.  Oh and Garret thinks he is so smart but u cant force the hand that slaps the horse  (patent pending)

      So today is sunday and i originally planned to study till my eye's squirted from ma head, but im taking a little break from that right now.  OK i woke up at 7 this morning (are ya proud) and i couldnt get back to sleep so im like,"What fun it would be to re-anylize the effects cavour played on european unification."  That was good because i got it down.  Count Camillo Benso di Cavour played a major role in european unification throught his work as a statesman, brief membership in parliament and blah blabbah blabbityblah.  Anyway, so he was a helpful person.    Im about halfway through my european final review packet(yes another packet) and i hate it.  I need to be done with it by wednesday because thats when the final is, my first final.  Im not too worried about it though, i need to have science down because i need an A in that class.  and im tinkering between a B and an A and i cant seem to move it.  BLAH.    Summer! its almost here and i cant wait.  Im going to be making mass amounts of money because i can babysit all day long (no skewl) everyday FO-EVA!!!  Finally i can buy what i have always wanted............... The REDVINES EMPIRE!!!!!!!!! muahahahahhaha.  sorry, im stressed like silly putty.  I better be going now because this packet isnt going to finish itself!  OUtIe

         Ok so today is thursday and i feel like this week will never end.  I just want this to be over with already, finals, school, everybody.  People are getting annoying at the end of the year and i just want to scream.  I cant stand it, i just want to lay down and go to freakin sleep or spend more than a half an hour watching T.V.  This summer is going to be a well deserved break for me and to be honest i really dont want to put up with people and their stupid problems.  I know that sounds mean, but i dont have the time nor the patience to put up with crap from people right now.      I talked to most of my teachers today to see what i have in their classes and for the most part its good.  Spanish-97,English-96, art-100, european-84 (i know its bad), math-91.7, and stupid science-88.  I really hate science, the stupid teacher wont let me make up a disection that i missed, he said i can do a makeup, but whenever i talk to him about it, he just says, "see me tomorrow". What a douche.        OK so i watched the Angel series finale and man, it sucked.  It didnt feel like an ending show, they didnt finish like anything.  Not to mention that they never gave finality to the Buffy/Angel love story.  Even a simple phrase like "Its time to check the oven," or something like that would have made me (and kat) way more happier.  [For my exact quote check kats blog] Another thing is that Angel killed Hamilton and he is supposed to be immortal while working for Wolfram & Hart but angel sucks his blood then kills him.  Whaaaaa Happened??? Whaaaaa???...........???????  Whaaaaa??? The whole Fred/Wesley thing was sad and i am glad that they atleast finished that thing.  The scene with Lorne and his final act was kinda depressing because it was completely unexpected and the way Lorne handled it was just like his character would.  OK so the whole season and the series for that matter was to get angel back to being a human through the prophecy and they didnt even finish that, those bastards.  We all know that Angel is the true champion and Spike is not, but i still would have liked to see that played out.  ok so me and kat are like, "lets write our own ending for angel on our blogs!"  but do to time constraints until summer, i can only give a brief detail about my ending.  Enjoy!  Angels like, lets separate and kill them all, and everybody is like ok and then they separate (no signing of anysort) and kill all the members of the black thorne or something.  Wesley dies and Iliara mornes and also has more fight scenes, KAAPOW!! Gun is hurt and spike returns the baby.  Lorne leaves and Angel, spike, iliara, and gun meet in the alley.  At around this time, it should be half into the show.  Suddenly!!!!!!!!  Buffy and Gang show up with a buncha slayers, the ones from buffy and more, new ones, and they are all like, lets fight the dragon together! yay!  So they all enter this big fight scene, people die, and bad guys die more.  The camera shows what the characters can do and pans in, to the slayers and others in a cinimatic "oooo my" kinda way.  They kill the dragon, close the portal, and all are safe again.  Upon killing the dragon, angel glows in a mystical light and is all ooooooo ahhhhhhhh.   Buffy turns to him in the last few seconds of the show and is like, im done baking.....   WOW i think that would have better and im sure a lot of you would agree with me.  I know i didnt cover like everything, but remember, this is only a little piece and your gonna have to wait until summa to see the full ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    This was one long update and i hope it satisfies all of u people!!! I almost forgot that MY european group holocaust project won for the best in the class, lets see how it holds up for all the classes.

              Well i have been really busy lately and havent had enough time to post in my blog so sorry yall.  Lately i have been working on an AP European packet which is the devil.  It is insanely hard and time consuming, thx Ms. Patty.  And this is for everyone who doesnt know already, I made the school newspaper staff as a writer so i think thats pretty cool.         First off i feel bad because i havent talked to anybody (the busy-ness is overwelming) so if you are reading this (the very few that still check up) sorry and I am partly free to talk because Im done with Euro.           The school art show went off pretty good, it was probably really boring to the guests because once you walk through the room, thats pretty much it.  The band was interesting, not the stuff i heard on the demo, but thats alright i guess.  I thought they were ok and i liked the tribal dances and bongos.  I had a lot of fun working up at ticket sales, i think the people that came are weird, they kept handing the money to the wrong person.  After that i went to jacks game and had some fun with kat and garrett for like an hour.         Angel was on last night, it wasnt very good, cept for the reference to a little "party" involving Dharla and Drucilla.  The Fred thing was sad and i miss her character and i dont like where they are headed with Ilihara.  The whole Immortal thing is horrible, i dont think this apocalypse actually has a story to it, we know just about it as much as the characters do and for that fact, as much as the writers (who probably make it up a week before it airs).  They killed Spikes character and they are driving Angels into the ground.  Is it just me or are spike and angel getting gay?  They act weird together now and its very disturbing.  Next we will see angel and spike falling in love on their path to be the champion *shivers with disturbance* Remember what angel said at the beginng of the season where he had no prob spanking men?  That was just the begining.  Oh man Joss, if u happen to stumble across this humble little journal, then heed my words, KILL SPIKE!!!! AND MAKE ANGEL AND BUFFY DO IT!! AND BRING BACK ANYA! KILL WOODS AND BRING BACK jenny, o and maybe professor walsh and what about that one lady, whats her face, buffy's first roommate in college, and molly and amanda and vi.  Just a thought Joss.          Well kiddos thats all the time that I have for today so ill see you next time aboard the magic school bus!

      first off, happy birthday (little late) to Carolyn!!!  I didnt have a chance to write yesterday so HAppy Birthday!           OK so i just got home from hanging out with nicole and it was great.  We first went to the mall because she had a coupon for a necklace or something but they said NO! and she cried, well not really but we were sad.  Then i remember that today is monday, and thats snowcrab night at  red lobster  so im like,"Lets get some crabs," and she's like, "from hookers again?" and im like "no from red lobster!"  so im like ill treat.  (paraphrased) so we went and had lotsa fun. We talked about life and its meaning and how much our naked grandma is kinda gross.  So the waitress was kinda rude to use because she probably thinks we tip bad, but my sis always makes me over-tip.  So after a long meal, we ask for the bill and im like   me: Hey nicole, pass me your purse under the table  nicole: Why!?  me: Just do it  nicole: NO!  me: come on!  nicole: are you gonna take the plates?  me: no why would i want the plates?  nicole: NO!  me: (me eyeing the bisketssss)  nicole: NO! they lose their taste when you leave the resturant!  me: yesssssss!  nicole: NO!  It was good, So they waitress came with the bill and i pull out my phone because it has a tip calculator and im said i never get to use it and now i can.   ....*calculating* ....   me: we owe her $4.00  nicole: give her $5.00  me: No!  nicole: Yes  So i counted out $5 in singles and i put it in the black book thing and as i put it on the table i pulled out $1 and couldnt stop laughing.  I choked on my soda.  So we left and i told nicole and she got mad, but then was glad i did it.  We got back to my house and im like you can keep the bizkits and she's like we went through all that and now you dont want them! so im like  mom will see the evidence  and  shes like so will ryan !  So shes like take them and im like ok and as she was pulling out of the driveway, i put them on the seat. so when she was on the street, she threw the box at me (the bizketss) and it opened up so there was biskets on the driveway.  I picked them up and started throwing them at her car and kept hitting her hood and door. IT WAS SOOO AWESOME!!! I WAS ON THE GROUND LAUGHING SO WILDLY!  I could hear her as she drove off skweeling (spelled like this from now on)in her car (she was laughing) it was great.  I called her and she was laughing so much she almost died!    O i almost forgot, between the trip to the mall and the trailer-trash extravaganza at red lobster, we went to the dollar store and i got some certs..... i believe 12 packs.  I just grabbed the whole box carrier thing they were in. In the car i put 13 mints in my mouth (well i had enough to do it)!  I only paid $3 for all of them.  is awesome!  So thats it for now, ill write more later, also garrett and kat, WRITE MORE!!  look who never updates now!  hehehehhehe

      So me and Kat have been keeping really odd hours (sounds kinda cool, like we're time travelers).  We both have been staying up to like 5 am and dilly dallying around, which is extremely not healthy but what does that matter, we are the youth of the nation,  We dO wHAHteVA wE WhANt!   Tonite has been the first time i have slept when the sun was not out, which is bad.  Yesterday and the day before, continued," "," "," "," "," "," ", ( i think thats how you do a ditto)(i think thats how you spell it, thats how they spell it on pokemon)(ditto that is)  I just got done reading garretts xanga and i feel bed that he couldnt go to his concert, i know how much that meant to him.  I thought the whole augie conversation (the first one) was ended with garretts ticket garunteed, sorry garrett.  And why not get mad at her, she gave it to someone else, release your anger and xanga it (doesnt have the same feel to it as blog it).  I know i would.  Well hey, there are some really good concerts coming up that the triad needs to participate in.  MUSE/THE CURE, TRAIN/I FORGOT, and some others that are great.  And i found out that i AM going to wisconsin this summer, but not for long.  Im only going to be going for like 2 weeks at the end of july and coming back on like the 6th of august i think.  I also think im going to be able to make the Muse concert, so kat, dont fear.  Im kinda worried right now because my foriegn friend Andrea (an-dre--a) is having a goodbye party to kick her back off to florida with a bang, then well, to germany.  And its going to be tonite sometime ( cant find the card ) but never frear (yes frear) because she is having two of them!  Today and tomorrow so thats a relief.  Also i just always could call "Andrea who rocks" (diff andrea).  Eh we shall see what the winds of time blow in.  Going to be FUN!  Kaufen! (you have to buy now)(i think)  Gotta go but ill blog or call later.  FIREFLY MUST LIVE ON IN A MOVIE OR SOmething.

          Hey everybody, looks like im updating again! So this week has been really busy (i know!) and my sis got sick with some kind of virus so i've been taking care of her and hanging out with her so she doesnt choke on her own "soup" as she likes to call it.  Hopefulley i wont become one of the infected (oooooo creeepy) and stay moderatly healthy.  I think im ok so thats all good.       Last night was the season finale of  the sopranos  and it was kinda sad.  So my Adriana is really dead and christopher is all like boohooo she says she loves me but couldnt take 5 years in prison for me booohooo! whatever, christopher is basically tony's dog.  And tony says that they are going to bury her and christopher can be there to do it, too.  Another thing is that Carmela has no clue about ade,which is sad, but the really sad thing is that Adriana can be shot and no one bothers looking for her, not even the feds (who basically sealed her fate) bothered thinking she was killed.  Whatabuncha crappers.        Drea de Matteo (adriana) is leaving  the sopranos  and is going to play Gina, the sister of Joey on Joey.  That show is going to reeeeeek.  That'll teach people that FRIENDS is dead, it has been for sometime now.  FRIENDS ended when everybody started sleeping around, im surprised no one has any STD's.        Thats it for now, im going to go watch the second part of  the dead zone  and see what happens to johnny
