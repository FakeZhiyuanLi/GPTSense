       Eu te amo porque te amo.      Não precisas ser amante,   e nem sempre sabes sê-lo.      Eu te amo porque te amo.      Amor é estado de graça   e com amor não se paga.     Amor é dado de graça,    é semeado no vento,   na cachoeira, no eclipse.      Amor foge a dicionários   e a regulamentos vários.      Eu te amo porque não amo    bastante ou demais a mim.      Porque amor não se troca,   não se conjuga nem se ama.   Porque amor é amor a nada,   feliz e forte em si mesmo.     Amor é primo da morte,    e da morte vencedor,   por mais que o matem (e matam)   a cada instante de amor.

       During Chem's class:   Dunno what the hell is going on now.... My closest friends are becoming the distant ones, n I feel lonely n alone... Shit happens I know... But I've kept a lotta shit bottled inside n someday it will blow up. N mayb kill me... Everyone's acting strange... I'm acting strange... There's just too much pressure to take... I'm hating the world n it's reflecting on my relationship with everybody... My mom is just fuckin' annoying around... Brother is 'brothering' around too... n it makes me wonder if it's worth to live... I need to get away n be able to live it up... live my life... Make my own mistakes n learn from them. It's 2 boring when u have sbd to tell you what to do when everyone around doesnt. I just wonder sometimes why not freak out n make everything upside down n insideout... ArGh Why do I have to shut n conive with it all? I'm going crazy... Maybe I should switch off for a whilen stop to think about everything... n everybody... All the shits I've been thru... everything I've done... Speakin of which, I also wonder if it's worth to be thru this... or better... if  he 's worth all of this...  *takes a deep breath*  I wonder if I'm doing the right thing... Maybe I ain't... Maybe I am... I can't seem to understand A thing I do... Dunno... I am not the way I thought I were... Nth like I used to be...  *cries*        During Bio's class:   ArGh... Won't the damn woman stop talking?? Why should I be like this? It's not supposed to feel this way... dunno... dunno... dunno... I really dunno... I didnt want to talk nor be with anyone but  this guy ... Yeah... I need to tel him everything, make him understand n accept it... shit shit shit!! Life suxxx! A LOT! I'm sleepy... Really sleepy... Oopsss! Alarm rang! Time for lunch... c ya

       Well... I'm confused... Nothing is going the way I wanted it to. It's like there's always sth or sbd to make it crash down or sth...   Dunno... My best friend... Fudu... Wtf is happenin to us? that's THE question... I have no idea... He's all distant you know... All 'blah'... Walking with these other girls... No problem with it. I even like the girls... they'r super nice. Still... he has forgotten me... I'm like: hey.. fudu.. he's like: wait a sec... n doesnt look at me again...   Was it sth I did?      Just like my best best friend... I've moved out ZS.. n now we'r kinda distant... Dunno it's not like b4 obviously...      N there's this other reason which I really don't wanna comment here... It's definitely driving me crazy... =S      Somedays I sit staring out the window w  atching this world pass me by   Sometimes I think there's nth 2 live 4   I almost break down n cry   Sometimes I think I'm crazy   Why am I here?   Am I just wasting my time?   But then I see my baby n s  uddenly I'm not crazy cuz   it all makes sense when I look into his eyes   Sometimes it seems the world's on my shoulders n that e  veryone's leaning on me   Sometimes it feels the world's almost over that's when he comes back 2 me      But I juat wanna take this time out to be perfectly honest cuz there's a lotta shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul n just know that i grow colder the older i grow... this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy n harder to hold n this load is like the weight of the world n I think my neck's breakin... Should I give up or try to live up 2 these expectations?      gone by now...
