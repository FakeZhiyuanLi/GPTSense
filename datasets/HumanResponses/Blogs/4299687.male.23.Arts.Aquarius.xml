      During the last week of March 2004, two friends and I were on a road trip to New Orleans for spring break. The three of us fell for a police trap and were arrested in Stone County, Mississippi. My two friends were charged with misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and I was charged with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby. If I hadn't taken the blame, all three of us would have been charged with felonies and the two of them would be in much more trouble now than I am.  Flash forward to today...  I am 23 years old. I am a college graduate (Bachelors in Communication &amp; Art). I am employed by my father (who spent $4,800 to bail me out of jail). I work as a detailer, graphic designer, and a networking technician. On the weekends I work for an entertainment company as a disc jockey. I have a $3,000 credit card debt, a $17,000 student loan debt, and a $4,800 debt to my parents. One day, within the next year or two, I will have to go to court for the felony. Right now, I barely make enough money to pay my bills and some how I have to save for lawyer fees. Any ideas grounded in reality on how to handle this situation?

      After I followed a link to the "I Love Bees" blog from  urlLink www.penny-arcade.com  I decided it was about time I actually started my own blog. About six months ago I had started an online journal, but at the time I was drowning myself in Smirnoff frequently (daily) and lacked the motivation to sit down and write. I think now I have the time and mind to actually keep up with this.  When signing up for my blog, I could not for the life of me think of a name for it that would be worthy. I stopped right there. If I don't have a decent name for my blog, what's the point? I figured, something would come to me eventually and it did. I saw Garden State last night (Go see it, it's fantastic!) and it gave me the name for my blog. The movie sums up all the thoughts and feelings going through my mind at this moment in life, thus, my Infinite Abyss will be this blog. I hope you enjoy it.
