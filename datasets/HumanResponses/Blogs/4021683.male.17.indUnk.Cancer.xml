      I learnt how to shake today. No, not that shake. And certainly not that one. Don't even dare think of THAT one. Shaking is extremely difficult. How the hell do you lip slur up and down as fast as&nbsp;your stubby little fingers doing a&nbsp;trill? It's horribly insane. Then, there's the cheap method. Just do the trill. It sounds awfully fake though. I have to train my sloppy chops to shake. I swear that Tokyo Kosei trumpeters are some pagan trumpet gods. Chops that are faster than lightning and louder than thunder. Argh, no time to add on. Homework's calling me. I...need...to...go...   For technical assistance please call 1-800-88-1900. (Don't take me seriously.)

      I've been thinking of copying content from other blogs and editing them so it would look as if I wrote them. I could just find people's, who were with me during the day, blogs and copy the relevant parts. Or I could ask people to refer to other blogs if thay wanted to know what happened today. So much easier!&nbsp;Okay. I'm supposed to write&nbsp;what happened&nbsp;in my own point of view and in my own words. My GP is going to improve after blogging.  Let's start with how i got to school. I left my house at 7.15. What the hell. Rao's chihuahua died. I'm actually feeling sad. I've never felt sad for any human death before (No, I'm not a dog, if that's what you're thinking). Sorry for the brief intermission. Okay, where was I? Nevermind, I can't remember.  I'm quite surprised. I handed in my physics practical on time today. I have not done that since the O level practicals. Did my encounters with the Demons of the Staff Room do wonders? Or am I changing for the better? Must be the former. Oh wait, I feel my mind undergoing turbulence now. I should end this monologue right here. Hey, dumb people like me need a break. Our&nbsp;grey matter gets tired more easily.   May explode or leak if recharged or improperly installed.  No mercury added.    &nbsp;

      Yesterday, I set up my blog. I don’t particularly know why I set it up. What devil had possessed me to do so? I can’t even think of what to write. I end up writing meaningless strings of words about why I can’t write. Stupid isn’t it? I can’t write anything personal here. It would be the equivalent of backstabbing (unless its funny). Would I go to such an extent? I’d rather be in the gallows. So now I have to find other things to talk about.   Look at the lame stuff I scribbled in the previous post. Don’t blame me. It was pretty early in the morning and my eyelids were starting to pay the price for being awake too long. Do I have to spew gibberish everyday like yesterday? I can’t keep it up. I don’t have Woody Allen’s wit to make it funny. Is it worth to start a blog?   Okay, to hell with that. This might be the last entry for this stupid blog. Every word I type is torture. Even my GP esays aren't this long. Okay fine. You want to know what I did today? I went to my grandmother's house. Nothing interesting other than eating venison. I ate three puny plates of fried rice. Not to mention one plate of Hor Fun. And,... Doomsday will arrive before I end the list. I have school tomorrow so I am terminating this vile electronic parchment now.    You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do will be used against you in the court of law( or something like that).

      I have no idea why&nbsp; I created this. It's extremely tiring to think of what to write of next. My english sucks and my fingers are slow. I can't even complete assignments on time, so why plague myself with this screwed up portal that you humans call a blog. Hehez. This is worse than friendster. Anyway, I'm supposed to tell the whole world what happened from my point of view today. That's what blogs are for right?&nbsp;Here it goes.&nbsp;Once upon a time in the central province of Temasek, there lived an ectomorph&nbsp;named Vignesh. He put on his Brother proof vest (CJC uniform), armed himself with a bag of grenades,&nbsp;strapped on his bloodthirsty boots&nbsp;and stepped out of the house with his mother. Yes, his mother. He walked in an apelike manner to his&nbsp;red chariot (SBS Service Number 153). Soon, he was in the Blue Fortress. He led his mother to face his&nbsp;the demons. Demon number 1 was Mr Alex Kwee. Armed with the scimitar of Economics, this creature packs a punch. Don't be fooled by its geeky look. This demon had a sub demon. A pet demon(my co-form tutor)&nbsp;which he kept by his side to enhance his menacing looks. Vignesh endured the&nbsp;endless tongue lashing (We will not go into detail because of the nature of its content). Vignesh's mother scolded him for being lazy. Demon number 2 was the awesome Mr. Thirukotti. He weilded the staff of Dark Arts (Tamil). The encounter was a short one as Mr. Thirukotti needed to patronise the loo. The third demon was Mr. Ho. He carried with him the deadly Set Square of Maths. Instead of another lashing, we sat down for tea. Vignesh's mother felt less angry after this. They proceeded out of the Blue Fortress. The ordeal was over. Or so Vignesh thought. Just as he was leaving the Hall Of Blame, a big white figure&nbsp;blocked the entrance. It was the Chief Demon, Brother Paul. Vignesh stood in shock as his mother and Brother Paul enjoyed a light hearted chat. That was the last time Vignesh was seen. If anyone has seen the rascal, please don't call me. I'll call you.    &nbsp;   Any resemblance to real life characters are purely coincidental.    Give me a break, i'm running out of lame ideas.

      I am one useless sack of shit. I have relatively little to do, compared to other people, and yet I have trouble juggling the incredibly minute number of tasks at hand. Anyway enough of this life draining chant. I just got the recording of pwer rangers! SJIMB alumni played it at our concert. The song is fun. Packed with loads of it. The trumpeter sucks. He has no proper air support. He sounds like a car horn being flushed down the lavatory. That stupid fool better buck up before I start running after him with homework cocktails.  Everyone is so stressed. I am not. That equals me being something, not some one. I can't really help. I only can smile. And thank you to everyone. I owe you all alot. I have nothing else to regurgitate. Tata! (that means grandfather in tamil.)   Based on your privacy settings, no cookies were restricted or blocked. Yummy.

      I am amazed at my stupidity. I know my lips will get a rather mild form of elephantitis when I play lower brass instruments. Yet, I jammed those two strips of flesh dangling from my face onto the trombone and played like a lunatic. I am too tired to write more. Sayonara soya sauce!

      My blog has been in the freezer for some time. I wanted to discontinue this darn thing, but Derek had to coax me into updating! Let's begin the thawing.  The universe was compressed into an infinitely small point. The laws of physics break down at this point of singularity. Millionths of a second later, the minute dot of space expands into the size of a grape fruit. Wait a minute. That's too far back. Fast forward to this morning. I was two minutes late for school! What should you do when you're late for school? You should go have something at Novena Square's Long John Silvers'. Or is it John's Slivers are Long? I met my classmate, Tze Wei, on the bus to school, so we decided to walk to Novena. Thanks charity walk! I spent alot of money there. We wanted to study but we ended up spewing saliva over strictly stupid topics.  I have a test tomorrow. I don't even know what to study. Not that i want to. I'll get what I get every test. To get an F! (Thinking Pinky and the Brain?) Okay, my conscience is asking me to shut up. Why should I plague innocent blog readers (yeah, right.) with my nonsense? Hopefully I'll update this thing in the future. I might be dead tomorrow. See you later alligator!   To scroll toward the beginning of a document in large increments, press PAGE UP.

      The end of my blog? I cannot translate my feelings into words. I've tried but to no avail. If only you could hear what I think. My lips are tired. I don't give them any rest. I am a lunatic. I am a deluded happy fool.
