      Dollywood was ok. Thunderhead was awsome. Tennessee Tornado needs to be redone it is was too short. And they need to get rid of one of the people that works there he is annoying. I'm bored again but, what's new? Band Camp starts in a few weeks so I'm happy. And saturday I'm going to a 4th of July Party (on the 3rd of July). And my new euphonium hasn't came in. I need to call them or get my aunt to.

      I noticed I have hardly been into contact with any of my friends. Well I'm bound to meet some of them at the Harry Potter movie. Just met someone from the Netherlands who also plays euphonium. Other than that I finished the fifth Harry Potter book. That was the gist of my night. Fixed some pizza something I haven't had in a while. O well I'm off to find something new today. Also I actually got a reply from someone about my blog. So I am happy that I occupied someones mind for a second.

      Nothing to do around here. What's new. I've been forced to read The fifth Harry Potter book for the third time. I need some new books to read. I think I might start on the  Tale of the Body Thief  by Anne Rice. She is an excellent writer if you can get past relegious issues. Thank fully I don't have to worry about that. I wish someone would read this blog other than me where I don't feel silly typing all of this.

      I'm going to start off my first blog by saying this is one of the most boring summers I've had and we have been out just about ten days. I don't have many activities to do. Not to say that I will not get some because I have Band Camp near the end of July, and after that band is going take up a lot of my time. I like many other of my fellow band members can't wait for Band Camp it is our one thing we are looking forward to. It seems as of late that things are happening more rapidly. Everything seems so jumbled up now a days. Used to I knew more what was going to happen to me. Now unexpected things happen more then ever. I mean my brother had a daughter born a few months ago. My mom's shoulder was messed up, then she finally broke it watering her flowers at two in the morning. As of late I'm beginning to wonder if I have picked my friends wisely enough. I'm probably just being I guess parinoid is the word. Also the shock of now being a high school freshman has sunk in on me. As I said in the title I want school to start up again. I live in a small city (or a big town depends on how you view it) and nothing exciting happens. Another part of it I guess is that my eighth grade year was the best school year I had, seeing as I had no bad teachers except for the band director. It was the total opposite of my seventh grade year which was absolutly horrible. One new prospect is a good library. I have already read a majority of the book that we could read. Sadly we don't have to read as much the only class occansionally will be english. I'm happy I'll be able to take most of the AP classes I wanted to take in my high school years. The only one that I didn't was AP Phycology. I'm taking the regular one though. It turned out to work out well because I needed something to go with my Economics class since I'm taking the AP U.S. Goverment class. Other than that I'm taking the English Honers/AP classes. I'm also taking Physics which is an AP class also. I'm also taking Caculus. If there was an AP class that I could do I signed up for it.                   Saying good bye and thanks for reading my post,                                                        Nathan
