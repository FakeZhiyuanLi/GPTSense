      Movers & Shakers - The Typical Karachi Gig  By Saphiya Khan      Email this article   Roadside Romeos, classy chicks, smoke from the mouths of I-m-a-chain-smoker guys, girls clad in trademark crisp white cotton shalwars and duppattas, million kinds of ring tones in an effort just to show offs their new Nokia 8910 (while no one is on the other end of the line), a bit of maa behen ki gaaliyaan, with a sprinkle of head banging and some booty shaking… and you’ve got a Karachi concert.  The Bahria gig that took place on the 9th of April was no different. Arranged by the 'Textile Institute of Pakistan’, the concert featured Mizmaar (a.k.a. NOT Mizraab) and Strings. The show started as usual about an hour late, not that I mind as the place was air-conditioned which helped my make-up not get ruined. But the guys sitting behind seemed to mind the delay making loud comments like “Abey buhut hogaya, ab shuru ker" and the likes.  Killing time wasn’t really a problem as I was trying to check out the self proclaimed "hunks" and the one in ten fitted-bell-bottom-clad babes. A concert is the best place to see all sorts of such namoonas. Skinny guys wearing sleeveless shirts or Johnny Bravos with broad chests n muscles dressed in two sizes too small shirts. Who ever they were trying to impress was heavily disappointed to say the least.  The wait was definitely worth it as the performance by Mizmaar was pretty darn good. It looked like Danyal Badshah (the vocalist) was high on something. The crowd enjoyed songs like Saday Nal, Tu Jo Merey and Ghalori. Kashan (the guitarist) seemed to be in top form as well. Charlie, of Mizraab, was on drums that night and Russell offered his fair share of kicks with the bass. The sound was unexpectedly amazing and that was all that the crowd needed.  The typical guys gathering in the front of the stage was quite entertaining. Seemed like some of them had 'shake it daddy' playing in their minds. Shakin booties wasn’t the only thing that caught the eye, the guys head banging were pretty freaky too.   Strings made their appearance soon after Mizmaar’s exit and the crowd was in awe. This time even the girls didn't try to restrain themselves and hopped in to dance at the front of the stage. Which was, of course, much to the guys’ delight.  The rhythmic claps and one step moves all seemed, well, nice. The wet macho men got some time to catch their breaths and dry their sweats (I am not exactly complaining about the smell but a bit of air freshener would have done some good). The audience hummed all the songs through out and the ones in front danced their heads off to songs like Chhaye Chhaye and Dhaani.  But of course, not all can go so well. After all it is a Karachi concert. Something seemed terribly out of place – it was all too perfect till now. And right then a little fuss was created when the dhakam peel began in the front rows. Our efficient security heroes jumped in and solved the matters by answering swears with swears, pushes with pushes and glares with bigger glares! The fuss soon ended and the heroes left with the 'sub set hai na?' Talk about efficiency.  Despite a few hiccups the gig was a good one. And those of you who missed it, kind of missed a lot. So watch out for your "not-my-type" bands… they might just be as rocking as the others....and oh, if the guy with the "unf**k the world" t-shirt is reading this, I must say that it was a nice way of grabbing attention... *giggle giggle*

                         Junoon_____over the years 1991 saw the birth of a new Pakistani band,Junoon.Only this time the birth was different.Junoon wasn't just another band, it was 'the' band. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I called them a 'revolutionary' band. They entered the mainstream at the time when jhankar ruled, hideous rip-offs such as baby-yeah(remember sajjad ali?) were super hits and the word 'rock' was alien to 90% of our population. They are indeed the pioneers of Pakistani rock. While mummy daddies refused to recognize junoon's efforts as 'music', a larger part of the youth embraced junoonism. To them junoon was a passion that became more intense with each album. Although its roots lie in Pakistan, Junoon has enjoyed fame and success all over the world, courtesy the international music channels such as V and MTV that pampered it every now and then. The band was successful enough to create a new genre in Pakistan, the Sufi rock. With music inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Jeff Black, Led Zeppelin and U2 and lyrics of great mystic poets such as Bulley Shah, Rumi, Ghalib and Iqbal, Junoon created a fusion that rocked the nation. (And a lot of other stuff too*wink*) Junoon's music is not categorized. It covered a wide range of topics in its music, from politics to the rise and fall of the taliban; they spoke up for all in their songs. Their bluntness and boldness added to their charms. They mustered up the guts in the time where media was anything but 'free'. The band began their work in 1990, when it comprised of Ali Azmat as the vocalist,Salman Ahmed the acoustic and electrical guitarist cum back up vocalist and Nusrat Hussain on the bass guitar. Their first album, Junoon, did not manage to hit the skies. It was highly criticized on, which isn't anything out of the blues for a new set up in Pakistan. It takes some time for us to get over the past and move on with something new all the time isn't it? The album Junoon, nonetheless, had some amazing tracks that were recognized in the later years such as Heer, Neend ati nahi and Rangoon main khoya. The negative response did not make Junoon lose all hopes. A year later, after bidding farewell to Nusrat Hussain and welcoming Brian o Connell as the bass guitarist, Junoon came up with their second album 'Talaash', a truck and roll album which funny to think was sponsored by close up. It was Brian's first album but his finesse didn't come until the third album, Inquilaab, released in 1995.Inquilab was no doubt the strongest pillar for Junoon.It proved their strength and rocked the Paki music scene with the smashing hit such as Husan waloon, Khwaab, Heeray and Saeein.Junoon was now a stable hit in Pakistan. In 1996 the cricket world cup saw a rise of a patriotic song "Jazba Junoon" that became an instant hit with the already crazed stalker cricket fans. The sales of their album, soared high and now their fan following included people of all ages, not just teeny boppers. The video for their religious devotion based song, Saeen managed to change the opinions of many critics including the country's so-called mullahs. The fifth album came out in 1997.Named Kashmakash, it again hit the top charts but this surely wasn't the best there was to Junoon.The band broke all previous records and entered the international market when their album "Azadi" was released. The head banging, typical rock style was so in, it gave all parents the freaks yet nothing could stop the growing fame of Junoon.Songs such as Khudi, Meree awaz sunoo and Yar bina were widely acclaimed and junoon became a household name. Junoon received  appreciation and acknowledgement even from the neighboring India, which was incredible, keeping in view the relations of the two countries at that time. The band won a golden disc for Azaadi at an international music channel awards after sharing the stage with top class international bands such as Pearl Jam, Oasis, Bush and the likes.  Their video for the song "ehtesaab" focused on our corrupt politicians and was ,as expected, banned from our local TV stations. The then P.M of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, banned the band claiming it was due to the promotion of jeans and long hair in Pakistani culture but it was a widely known fact that the ban was inflicted since Junoon refused to sing for his "karz utaro mulk sawaro' scheme and did the song "ehtesaab" with imran khan instead. The ban did not dampen their spirits, Junoon carried on with their promotion for peace. The band maintained a consistent ethical rectitude. Record sales were the highest for Azadi and it remains to be the king of all albums. The next album Parvaaz was by far superior to anything junoon had ever made. The production was flawless and the album had a complete theme and songs that seem liked they belonged. Plus it had ghoom, the epic. The song that had single-handedly defined junoon's greatness. Too bad the album did not do well in India. That got Junoon wondering what the hell happened and ever since they are clutching to the old fame which is somewhat fading away. The Pakistani music scene has gone much mature in the past 13 years and the audience has a vast choice now. With innumerable bands sailing in the sea, Junoon has a lot more competiton. Their next albums did not carry out the old charm and failed to impress the Junoonis. No wonder there were so many converts from 'junoonism'.Junoon's music now is more commercial than ever and now with the different directions and ali azmat's solo tracks out, there is not much doubt left about the 'stability' of the band. Their latest album deewar was no help to the falling repute and fame of the band, instead it made the fall deeper and with a louder 'thud'. Everything aside, Junoon has made its name written in gold in the Pakistani music history. With over 20 million records selling world wide, the band did play their fair share in making Pakistan proud. Many of us Junoonis have grown up with Junoon's music. It has been a part of us for over 13 years and it is no wonder we feel a sense of loyalty towards the band. We do miss 'our' junoon, the one that lacked commercialism. Every Junooni has a Junoon moment, and in return Junoon has a song for every situation in our life. There is a fondness for Junoon in our hearts for it has been with us for long. Funny how their music inspired us and changed our lives yet we never got to thank them. So here I do it finally, All hail to Junoon, for being what they are and for playing their part in our lives. And of course, for also making us realize there is more to ‘music’ than some do dee daa crap. Junoon rocks!!!

              The Ali Brothers                               Before I began my "flip-search" through the channels at mid night, I predicted to myself there would be noori with a doo dee daa song on IM, a few porn movies on the "night-time-only" channels my cable wala puts on, some old pushtu movie on UNI TV (wtf?)  And some never ending glamour filled Indian drama on star plus among my options to watch. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine seeing the "ali brothers" on PTV nighttime transmission. *Sigh* Wasn’t IM requested and Alizeh's favorite enough???? Why I took the pain to watch them for three full hours, you ask? Well, I couldn’t really miss the perfect combination of the guests and hosts. I mean, many of us would dread facing our ex's but doing that on national TV??? Ha ha...that's gotta be interesting...yes, along with Noor and Nadia was the humpy jumpy longhaired beauty (?) Mandana zaidi...for those of you who don’t know her.... she’s the same gal seen in all noori videos.... the one who tries high kicking in "tum hans diyey”. And was recently seen in jawad Ahmed's new song, tak dhina din. Oh and most importantly ,she happens to be his ex too. *sigh* The show started with the three hosts and the two guests striving to make a conversation. Mandana kept her eyes fixed on her hands. Even when she did speak, the words she used were “aap, jee, bolien”… ali noor and ali hamza kept running their hands in their thick hair.... the kind any girl wud kill for. Thank God they aren’t 100% girls.... I wud die if any girl besides me had that hair. A while later they acquired a mischievous tone, which didn’t fail to produce sly smiles on Mandana’s face. During the show, a few calls were placed to the Ali brothers’ family and friends and when Mandana called their parents ‘uncle and auntie’ and they replied with ‘tum’, all doubts in my mind were cleared. The show continued with Ali Noor blabbing endlessly. He even dissed Mandana twice. Ali Hamza backed him up with his occasional “Hun-Haan”. He sang his unreleased tracks “Merey kakya ki” and “gawal mandi”(that’s so unfair for BC, ainnit? *winks*) Yawning, I decided to switch the TV off but just then the phone calls were taken on air and finally the ‘fun’ part was here. There was a usual attack of the noorites at first, who seem to jump out of the receivers. Ali Hamza was receiving loads of requests to sing a song again but Ali Noor (read: the conceited one), sang manwa rey instead. The two even disclosed the fact that the initial plan was to have Ali Noor on the guitars and Ali Hamza on the vocals, which thank God didn’t happen! It hurts me to know there’s still space left for the band to sink lower*sigh*The most frequently asked question was “aap baal kyun nahi katwatey?”, which made Ali Noor get that “what-the-hell-is-your-problem?” look on his face. The end was near and yet nothing out of the blues had happened. It got me wondering where all the anti-noorites were? (Oh! And I did try to call in but couldn’t get through!) My eyes started to pain since I had already rolled them a gazillion times but the last three callers made it worth it. The conversation was something like: Caller1: Ali jee, my name is Amna .Do you remember me? We have met! Noor: I would know you by face Amna. Caller1: I’m the same girl who met you in Murree’s Usmania when you were with                 Anushay .You gave me an autograph on my bill. Noor (*blinks*): Uh, yeah I remember you. (Phone line disconnected) Host: Oh-Ho, disconnect hogaya… try again. …………………………………………………………………………………………. Caller2: Hey! I wanted to ask Ali Hamza how he came up with his song BC? What’s                 story behind it? Mandana (ever-so-eagerly): Jee, your question has been noted down. I’ll soon ask                                                  Hamza. And so she did. Twice (most probably in order to get back at Noor for dissing her). The first time Hamza ignored it slyly. The second time Mandana emphasized and Hamza blinked, looked blank and said,”kaunsa gana?” Talk about lameness! Ali noor barged in and changed the topic and this time Mandana let go. The third caller was the most interesting one. Caller 3: hello, I am blah blah. I have heard that Mandana zaidi and Ali Noor were having an affair. How true is that? (Mandana turns beetroot, Noor smilies, Hamza get an ear-to-ear grin, and the other two hosts have confused looks on their faces) Host: Umm, we’ll ask your question .Bye ……………………………………………………………………………………… Needless to say, the question wasn’t asked but an uncomfortable feeling did hang in the air. The show ended soon after that and I decided to flip through the channels once more before hitting the sack. The glam-filled dramas were still running on star plus, the pushto movie was about to end on uni tv(or so it seemed), the porn channel was still on and yes, as usual, there was Noori on IM!

      *Paan Ki Dukaan*   "An all chick band? Pakistani? Uh-Huh.Not possible." That's the most frequent reaction to PKD’s (Paan ki dukaan) existance. But we swear we exist! Erm, true we don't really qualify for the term "band" but you cannot even call us "not-a-band”. I mean we are there, present in the underground music scene and we know we'll never enter the mainstream but heck! We still rock! It all started within one week of the two of us becoming friends. Fanatic as we were about the desi rock scene, it wasn't hard to imagine ourselves as a band. After mustering up all our courage, we kinda gave our mums the 'outline' of what was on our minds and *booooom* Needless to say, we never brought the matter up again. We put our extra-genius brains to work and found a substitute for our dreams. We would make a band, but won't join the mainstream. After all both of us were already bathroom singers and no one seemed to mind that! Once we made the deal final, we were ready to face anything at all that came up. The very next moment we realized we didn't have any instruments nor a penny (yes, stuff was THAT bad). They say necessity is the mother of invention and we couldn't agree more. The idea clicked to Hira, the more creative one among us. We made a guitar (which isn't really as good as a real one but still!!!) out of a shoebox. Amazed? Don't be! All we had to do was make a hole through the side of the box and attach it with thick wood stick and cover the entire thing with three strands of long (real long) rubber band for strings and there! The guitar was ready! Saphiya’s guitar. Saphiya’s very own guitar. Homemade, fake but it was a guitar and it was all mine. ALL mine. Ah! Paradise: D Hira is the groovier one and her passion was solely for drums (though saphiya is the one who has a bad bad crush on waqar! *slurp*) The drums weren't a problem. Not at all. What is kitchen equipment for? We turned a plastic chair upside down, inverted two pateelas (read: haandees/thingi you cook food in:/) over the legs of the chairs and we even attached the lids of the pateelas for the 'extra' effect. Drumsticks were obviously spatulas and spoons. There! The "instrument problem" was solved. *Sigh* The next issue that came up was our name. We didn't want to sound 'oh-so-sophisticated' by using some French word nor did we want to sound conceited by using our own names (erm, ali noor doesn't get to read this, does he? *blinks*) Since we are desi girls with desi minds and desi music, the name we came up with was as desi as could be. Paan ki dukaan. *Winks*After this was decided, we covered our guitar and drums with shimmering paan wrappers to give the look we wanted and at our all girls' gig that are held at our studio (aka saphiya's storeroom), every person receives the chocolate flavored paans. *Slurp* Our music is not categorised.We'll do any kind. Rock, rap, jazz, Bhangra, pop, metal, punk rock, death metal...name it, we like it. We don't really have any proper songs to our account because we don't have the resources to make them but Yeah we did something which bands like junoon took years to do*evil grin*we ripped a song.'Ripped' is an understatement. We slaughtered the lyrics, scrambled the tune and VIOLA! We had our very own song. It’s called "Tu boring ho Gaya hai", ripped from one of the Uk bhangra bands. Red-hot flaming potato isn't our only inspiration (Doesn't every band like to use that word for the bands they copy? *giggle*giggle*) we adore the commercial advertisements’ jingles too. We soon plan to make a song called "paan chahiyey.kaunsa janab?" *grins*  Frankly speaking, we know we won't ever enter the mainstream but what we want to say here is that girls are capable of almost everything. I mean, we had nothing to back us up. No sources, no support, nothing at all, if we could come up like this, then somebody who has all the resources can work miracles. And we know there are girls with support and resources but they are too shy to come out. When we started we didn't know our next door neighbor would even know we existed but thanks to online forums and orkut, we have gained a little popularity. We’re even thinking of launching a website in a couple of months (yeah! As soon as we get jobs as dj's on some fm *pouts*) what's better, Faisal Shah even volunteered to model for our 'in-our-dreams' only videos. *Jumps up and down*we might borrow some instruments from our friends and record some covers on our stuck-up computers. The proverb,'where there is a will, there’s a way’, seems to be more meaningful now ainnit? So all you sisters out there go for it if you can. The 'first paki all girls’ band' label is gone but you can strive to be the second *wink*wink*.And if any parent reads this (which I seriously doubt), please don't underestimate your daughters and back them up like you would do for your sons. It’s the 21st century! HELLO! Cheers By : Saphiya Khan(aka the showboxist/vocalist)
