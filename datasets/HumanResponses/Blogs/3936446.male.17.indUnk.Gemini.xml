      After everything, you are telling me you can't commit. What's the meaning of this? TELl ME. CANT COMMIT. You say you like me, is this how you like a person? By hurting her time and again? I don't know why am i such a terribly stupid fool. Why am i so pathetic? I feel like a total idiot. I rejected other guys who treated me much better, all for your sake. All because of you. All because that i thought after SPM everything will be fine again. I thought. Just a fool's hope on my part. Stop telling me you like me. You have caused me enough pain todaym just in a matter of few minutes.

So we hav 2 find&nbsp;a replacement..a okok guy..kj is better lots of times. Wat can i do but resign to fate. The end of this means its the end of my basketball 'career' in my school. Thinking of it..i feel so bad. I hate form 5!!! I have lots of targets that are impossible 2 archieve now. Even though i enroll 2 form 6, my mates are gone. My volleyball team and basketball gangs. All gone. Separation.....its makes my mind whirl....cannot concentrate redi. I'm gonna miss all my frens...the feeling durin competition...all gone..only flashbacks are left....

Its my final year here and its my busiest ever...But I learnt so many things about life this year.. I am just too greedy...i want to learn everything...but......my mind can't take so much of it..even my teacher says that my mind is always not in class anymore..my mind is driffting away..my concentration level is going down...lower and lower...      But never mine...even though I am not me anymore, the new me...the new and more energetic me...filled with confidence and experience in life...will soon appear..and the new me shall be the one that shall help me go through this rough part of my life............

I've been moving house since saturday and until now the whole house is still in a mess. A terrible huge fucking mess. Whatever. Everyone is going in and out of the house. A-di, a-lai, mr.chua, mr.loo...god.. Speaking of a-di, i think he's gonna  bang his head on the wall soon cos i have called him twice to repair the air-cond cos it's not functioning properly. But that's his job right..haha.. Anyway, today my godbrother wanted to fetch me but his school ends late so i ended up getting a lift from xuan. Just hope he'll get his licence soon so he can drive me.hehe..bad sis ha... Now, Howe is in the same spot that i was once in. Just hope he'll pull through it. Sigh..if only i had a phone line. Damn the telekom people. Signing off.  P.S. Hey..kor kor..are you ok? ur headache ok edi? Jia you for your driving test k. Good luck!!!

      Ever wondered how it feels when silence hurts more than words? It's the worst sort of pain, if you know what i mean. Chewing you up, tearing you into pieces, mercilessly, then leaving you all alone to fend for youself. When you are bleeding to death. Playing with your emotions, triggering everything unknown to you, then throwing you to rock bottom. Silence is poison. To wait expectantly but be disappointed yet again. To look at your face and see nothing familiar. To hope for a hope so distant, you know it's not worth hoping for, but you go on hoping. All for nothing. To crave for a voice when you are in despair. To fall into the darkness and not wanting to come out of it anymore....whoever said silence is golden..

      Just read through my best friend's blog. Hmm...can't deny that we have some telepathy but hey, when you need me and i can't sense it, just call me for goodness gracious god's sake. Do you even need me to tell you that? As if you don't know i'll answer your call even if it's 3 in the morning. Wanted to call you just now. Before reading your blog that is. Picked up the receiver and then realized you are at tuition. What the hell. I really have a bad memory. Haha..

      The weather is driving me nuts, and no, this isn't a way of deviating away from some other topic. There's not even a single air conditioner at home now cos it has all been taken away to be put up in the new house. On an evening where even a camel could die from dehydration. Damn. I was sleeping just now and it was so hot that i woke up. Damn.

      Suddenly had the urge to listen to something soothing. And i found this. My reaction was a total mixture of "oh god..oh shit...aw man...." This song is really really really meaningful...   才知道　你臉上的微笑  不是幸福代表　是種不自在的禮貌    才知道　感情已經動搖  我一直被誤導　是你還不願意揭曉    太多小煩惱　怪我們不懂得拋  太多的問號　答案也都不必找  只換來疲勞　忘了要一起變老    為何要無話可說　才懂沉默比爭吵難熬  為何會在恨消失後　愛還是挽回不了  為何要在疼愛我的時候　才對我說離開我　都是為我好

      Yeah..finally my test is over. Gosh, what a huge relief. Biology is like shit but accounts was kind of okay. whatever. Anyway, I’ve collected Jay’s cd. Seriously, I’ve only heard one song as my cd player is currently stuck in repeat mode. I'll listen to the other tracks when i feel like it. Anyway, after school today, i got a lift from ing tai to kerry's. Quite paiseh..haha..Then my godbrother accompanied me to lunch and all that, and one thing i must say he really was very patient although i was like i don't want sushi i don't want season's..blah blah blah..haha.. After that ben came over. So all of us went over to omega at an extremely early time, so we ended up walking here and there. Damn funny of us. And i just realized today that spreading rumours is not a special talent of the girls. Haha.. Ok, off to sleep, i look like a total panda right now. It doesn't take a genius to tell that this is chronic sleep deprivation.

I'll always remember... It was late afternoon... In places no one would find...

      Having my monthly test now. It was actually okay but the bm essay was hard. Not knowing what to write was kind of panicking but i guess i did my best. Well, a different thing can be said for chemistry. I must say i was really blind. I saw the wrong thing and i think that whole question is down the drain. Just hope the otehr questions are okay. Anyway, this is not the trials, i shouldn't be worrying so much. Three more days to go to freedom. Haha..  P.S. : hey, kor ar, how was your driving lessons ? went on okay? Hope you did well la.

       Everything went fine for me today except my class..when i went to class this morning, there was no electric...dark...but why ruin a happy morning. So i went to my friends classes to chat wif them. Luckly their classes got electric. My school so "sesat" one. Only my block no current. Hahaz...I got so many results today. Bad, worse, average, better, all also got. Hope the others will all be in the better category. Got nothing to do during the 5th and 6th period so I tought of my meimei. Wonder how is she doing her examinations..hmm...Than i tought of her tuition. On Thursday. So I asked Ing Tai to fetch my meimei on Thursdays.  ALL the Thursdays. So that meimei can go there earlier and do not need to spend time on the slow and 'steady' public bas. hahaz..      P.S:My driving lessons was very fine. Driving is a norm for me already. Now I just hope to sit for the test as soon as possible so that i drive around (If can use car la) freely..hehez...u'll b my first passenger other than my dad, mom, n elder sis ;)
