      So due to the lack of a knife of proper size we were forced to cut a watermelon with a sword, doesn't that rule?  This brings to mind the concept of settling, who put such a premium on ambition?  I've oft heard people say to another you could do so much better or that if only they'd be great.  What's wrong with taking what comes, aiming low, contentment, station if you will, if happiness is the only premium.  How many find themselves empty after a lifetime of striving, all the time lost, all it takes is a few pauses.  So worry not, absolve the stress, take solace in your friends, toast to health and to sunshine.  Breath in the air, smell the flowers, cheers to the birds and put one foot in front of another and take whatever comes your way with a smile.

      Hockey Day!!  So good, and the one neighbour to the tennis court has this dog and he runs back and forth trying to follow the ball.  He's awesome reminds me of the days when I had my canine companion(s).  Over the years I've had a Black Lab (Sport), some little yappy thing (Cathy), a Pit Bull (Shadow), tree climbing Hound (Snoopy), German Short Haired Pointer (Rommel), Lab mutt (I've forgotten got hit by a car), Lab/Pitt Bull mutt (Ozzy), Lab mutt (Mr. Big - as in the band), Terrier mutt (Buddy).  Was usually the same story, mother would hold em over us saying she was going to get rid of em and then usually did.

      Dropped in an ocean of uncertainity, but for short moments of time We collect up the peices of our being as we follow the path towards completion Some discarded, others consumed and we trod forward Cylic the notions are thrust upon us from those that came before Wisdom said to be the spoilers of life Intuition the warning light, compassion the safety rope shared Love dangled purported to be salvation, yet so often muddled And on so I swim, searching for that bright star Some destination revealed

      So I had a sleepless night full of unsettling dreams.  Worst of which and as such I vaguely recall, was of witnessing a car accident.  In this: a woman is struck head on and is pinned within her car.  Unable to do anything I merely hold her hand and listen to her ramblings as death comes and claims her.  Not much of a dream analyst I'm left to carry a piece of despair with me on this day.  "Things I remember, things I forget.  I miss you,  I guess that I should.  3500 miles away, what you would you change if you could?" - Raining in Baltimore, Counting Crows

      Not often forseeable one breeds hope, excitement the other often despair, regret and longing.  One would hope in a lifetime there are more happy endings than unpleasant beginnings and that not all good things come an end.  Some would argue the start has little bearing and that the course outweighs the outcome in importance.  In saying so, how do you take your journey?  Each and every step planned in advance of the next?  Eyes closed with finger in the air, wind carrying ya forward?  Choice or chance, methodical or whimsical, can one harness both?  Methodically choosing chance?  I like it, let's see how it works.

      In this day and age with communications the way that they are, why is it I'm left to wonder "what such and such is up to these days".  My list of bygone friends is far too long and one day I may have to take up a quest of relocation and reaquaintence.  Now let's say that after 5 years or 10 even really nothing's changed and two people have nothing to share short of the movies they'd seen lately and re-hash tales of auld.  Would that be a shame?  From where does this cyclic notion come?  Progress?  Sucess?  What are these things really?  As I sip my fruit punch cool-aid stare at the cursed birds on my balcony, I remember the good times and I smile.

      Too much of good thing?  We've all heard it said.  When and where does it apply or to what?  Is sabotage acceptable to acheive balance?  Do we owe it to ourselves to bask in for all it's worth?  In what situations might a person make decisions for another, if deemed their best interest?  All this and more I ponder as I try and savour the Pistons victory tonight.

      Now most probably people have been most everywhere, but what one person has been the most places?  That guy/gal I'd have for a neighbour, imagine the stories.  Not that I don't love my here, my now, but we all often find ourselves romanticizing distant lands and times past.  The beauty that is existance, that is the human brain, to carry one's self fantastically.  Is there ever a limit might be a good question, how many lose themselves never to return?  Where do obligations lie?  I think I'll take this yellow brick road a bit further, I hear the Shire is nice this time of year.

      So much is said in a smile and is from each and every one I draw my inspiration.  Even in a virtual void such as Egypt people manage to convey them with their words and actions, a testament to empathy and the human spirit if there was ever.  So I will let an exchange I had this afternoon with a child of 3 carry me untill the next, knowing in this world I am not alone.   Sunday!!  My pick-up hockey day and after 12 years (minus a hiatus or two) it never tires to hear them boys bicker.  Raland thinks forward to next week and smiles.  Ok the Lakers are being pushed to brink on this night. (oversight) Go Pistons!!

      You'd think that going through your life void of ache might be a good thing, but just maybe it gives us the ability to appreciate the bright.  The question is from where does the fear or hope come?  All I do know is that you haven't lived till you've been escorted from a theme park by security.  Damn, fountains are irrestible!!  Lakers are being pushed to the brink tonight, Go Pistons!!!

      I don’t feel the suns comin’ out today Its staying in, it’s gonna find another way. As I sit here in this misery, I don’t Think I’ll ever see the sun from here. And oh as I fade away, They’ll all look at me and say, and they’ll say, Hey look at him! I’ll never live that way. But that’s okay They’re just afraid to change. When you feel your life ain’t worth living You’ve got to stand up and Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky. And when your deepest thoughts are broken, Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin’ it’s time to die. And as we all play parts of tomorrow, Some ways will work and other ways we’ll play. But I know we all can’t stay here forever, So I want to write my words on the face of today. And then they’ll paint it And oh as I fade away, They’ll all look at me and they’ll say, Hey look at him and where he is these days. When life is hard, you have to change.

      I for the most part let them guide my day, my life.  So when this PC begins to experience video/memory failures, I find myself faced with yet another obstacle and immenient exile from Egypt and that of my adoptive family.  To which I ponder the conspiracy they've set me against and wonder what they'd not have to be.

      An excellent film, set in Boston of all places!!  "Wicked Awesome"  Dialogue driven, it revolves around 3 characters that grew up together as children.  Tim Robbins haunted by a horrible event from childhood becomes suspect in the murder of Sean Penn's daughter.  Sean plays the local ganster/godfather type and puts pressure on the third friend (Kevin Bacon) who also is the lead investigator.  All in all,  I was pretty riveted, and nearly in tears when Kevin comes to Sean towards the end looking for Tim and says "Have you seen Dave?  Dave Boyle?" to which Sean replies "Last time I saw Dave, he was in the back of a car heading that way down the road" refering to the abduction Dave had to endure.

      There are two kinds of people in this world:  Those that liked Milli Vanilli and those that lied and said they didn't.  "Blame it on the Rain, yeah ya"  Yeah I liked them (shrugs).  Was asked today what animal I thought I was and also what color.  I have to say yellow, well cause I like it and I like to think I'm a bright star, or maybe just timid.  As far as an animal goes, gonna be a chipmunk on this date, mmmm sunflower seeds.

      If we were to categorize people into:  A) Those that know stuff  B) Those that know little  C) Those that know little but know it  I'd wonder where I fall and if there should be a  C) Those that know stuff but don't don't know  or a D) Those that don't know stuff but know it and don't care even E) Those that know stuff but know it and worry?  Also can a wanderer "have" a path?  A destination in mind but no set route to get there?  How long can ideals sustain you?  Hehe all these and many things begin to enter this Canadian boys mind with the end of the Hockey season, long summer, and the prospect of labor fall out.  Too much to hope the World Cup never ends till Gary and Bob get it done?  Lol, /me ponders the endless overtimes and smiles

      The Last Hours of a Kingdom  Watching the events of judgment and sentencing unfold, plight of the queen and anguish evident on the kings’ face as he pronounces her death on a flaming stake.  All this Gareth overlooks, attention drawn instead to rafters of hanging banners and a coat of arms collection never amassed in one court before.  Up to the shock and pain in faces of servants stopped to take a peek seemingly unnoticed.  His glance travels over to the ancient table made of some unbeknownst dark hued wood.  All present around the great symbol of brotherhood are solemn in face, all but one that is.  Sir Modred wounded in Lancelots’ escape sits smugly, as if all transpiring falls according to some grand scheme. Sir Gawain now at the Kings right Kay as always to the left.  Something said, falls on deaf ears as he mentally counts the others.  So few remain, days before a dozen were slain by Lancelot and the other absentees his family and kin fled for fear of reprisal. “Sir Gareth?” addresses Arthur once more. “Gareth, snap to man!  The king speaks to you!” reprimands Gawain.  Revelry ended, Gareth turns to the fellowship.  “Your Lordship, you command me?” The King pointing at the disheveled queen orders “Escort her to her apartments.  You and Gaheris shall hold vigil on her this evening to be her last.  Grant her any earthly wishes.  I shall send a troupe for you at Dawn and I’ll see you at the execution grounds.”  “Yes Milord.” Gareth humbly replies and is echoed “Of course, Milord.” By his Brother Gaheris  Traversing the grandiose halls of Camelot Gareth once more gets caught up in reflection.  In how the shadows would seem to dance in union with the sconces that spawned them in an endless game of tug and how the cobblestones would click as he walked with almost a skipped pace, reduced now only to gloom and echo.  Walls all adorned with tapestries of valiant kings victorious in battle, but none of shepherds.  Even the noise of the constant hawking in the township below had fallen silent on this day.  “Did you ever notice that at times you can almost hear change or smell it in the air?  That the land seems to breathe it and if you could only see it, then it could be halted or harnessed.” rhetoricized Gareth as the three ascend the stairs leading to Gwenevere’s chambers.  “Perhaps it is this, the sorcerers tap, in creating their prophecy.” surmises Gaheris.  “I didn’t know you were so profound, Gareth.  A philosopher knight, how amusing.” smarts Gwen.  “Besides, I don’t hear anything.” states the Queen matter of factly.  “I know,” Gareth sighs resigned to keep his brooding to himself and a silence overcomes the trio.  Turning down the corridor leading to their destination Gaheris chimes in “There is an easy, peaceful painless way we could end this Milady.  Sending for poison, in your sleep you could merely fade away.  God wouldn’t slight her that, right Gareth?”  “He will, come for me.” Gwen confidently states now skipping over every other step.  “This is what we fear.” offers Gareth.  “Have you know shame, woman?” interjects Gaheris. “How much travesty shall you invoke in your reign?”   “How many women have you lain with?  How many has Arthur?  In this, I am no more guilty.” lectures Gwen.  “What of you, Beaumains?” “Call him that not, adulteress.” stammers Gaheris.  Pausing for moment Gareth answers “Beaumains, I am, mayhap not of the kitchen but servant none the less, unto God first, and to Arthur yes, but not his crown, to that vision and to the table.  Truly Lancelot is a peerless knight and his prowess coupled with your transgressions shall sunder all Arthur has built.” pleads Gareth.  “One son of Orkney has already fallen by his hands.” adds Gaheris.  “My father loved Arthur, you all love him.  Truly he is great.  I never had him whole, in this I am not strong and share in vision.” explains Gwen.  “I do and in it I believe!” Gareth exclaims.  “Damn you Gareth, damn you Gaheris, and damn your land.” shouts Gwen now red in the face.  With that they arrive at the large oak door leading to the Queens room.  Flushed in mind and body Gareth proffers, “Will you eat Milady?”  “For now, I wish only to write” responds Gwen curtly.  “Well here we shall remain, and need you anything, be sure to beckon”   “Thank you, Gareth” Gwen says sincerely.  The Door closes leaving the brothers to settle into their Guardianship.  Selecting an alcove with a window overlooking a large swathe of town and of the barbican, Gareth first stretches then rests against the brick wall captivated by a scene taking place below.  “Have you ever asked yourself what makes a man noble, brother?” queried Gareth as he watched a dirt-covered man pile wood in the street below the arch in which he now reclined.  “God did, of course.  He set us above the others” offers Gaheris as he spits out the window.  “In that choice shouldn’t we feel somehow indebted?” reasons Gareth.  “What’s gotten into you this evening?  I’m going to fetch us some drink, that should right your senses and tonight we shall toast Aggravayne”  The hours wane. Gareth dazes as Gaheris sips from his flask, telling a mounted boar head of all the deeds of his twin brother Aggravayne.  In this tired state Gareth comes to think again of the circular table, except now it was very large.  Gareth felt like an ant beside it.  The table had come to dwarf even mountains.  It now spanned rivers, toppled castle fortresses and encompassed the clouds.  Yet it showed its’ age, crumbling at the touch.  Whatever once held it together was no longer present, long forgotten or stolen away.  A quake rocks it, the black timbers split.  Gareth cries out, “No!” and moves to save it.  Too heavy for him to hold, its pieces crash together.  “It’s gone now” emanates an unrecognizable voice.  “No!” Gareth sobs into his own hands.  “Torn down by prideful knights” offers the voice.  Gareth scans the landscape for assistance, or comfort in company at least, and spots his brother Gaheris.  “You remember the tree fort we built, Gareth?” ponders Gaheris stirring Gareth from his trance.  “What?” intones Gareth, impatience showing on his tear strewn cheeks.  “The tree house Aggravayne, Gawain, and I built in the woods back home.” reminded Gaheris.  “We would play at king for days on end, and in later years you and Modred would come to join us.  You remember it right?” hoped Gaheris.  “Ahh, yes.” recollects Gareth.  “Aggravayne made a good king,” assured Gaheris “Was just poor at homage.  Anyways it’s gone now…”  “Sorry?” interrupted Gareth.  “The fort, it’s gone now.  Forest was burned to the ground, father would not share it.” filled in Gaheris.  “Yes right, I did hear of that” states Gareth.  “Ever the hothead was our father” justifies Gareth.  Now fully awake he begins to shine his armaments.  “We must look our best, on this morning of justice.”   Finished polishing and sharpening his sword Gareth sheaths it and then removes his belt.  “What are you doing, brother?” questions Gaheris confusion evident upon his face.  “Dawn draws nigh, we should be ready.”  “Remove yours as well.” Gareth calmly retorts.  “Today we go unarmed.” resolved Gareth turns to the arch in which he resided the night through while Gaheris can only stare dumbfounded.  Outside townsfolk, already busy in preparation for what should be an interesting and hectic day, and first there were things that could not be left undone.  A boy herding a small group of Bovine towards the gates and to the fields beyond looks up.  Two stories up a nobleman watches him, a knight perhaps even.  There is much distress in this knight’s face and eyes, he addresses the boy.  The boy replies with a meek “Yes sir?”  “Heard you of the Black Knight, Sir Perarde and his brothers?” tests the man from above.  “Indeed, is a tale common enough.” acquiesced the boy.  The knight in the window then drops what looks to be a sheathed sword and belt.  “With that sword, I able to overcame them all.  Perhaps it might serve you as it did me”  “Sir Gareth?” Bewildered the boy watches as Gareth turns back in towards the hall.  Grasping up his sudden bestowed gift the boy returns to his charges the cows.  Prodding them out the city and to the hill and field beside the wood, he thought only of the great knights.  With his very own instrument of death, he was Tristram, Lancelot, and Lamerok.  Maidens swooned at his passing, bard sang of his chivalric deeds, and he dined in amidst lords.  Responsibility brings the boy back to earth, and noticing the cows had split and begun to wander.    While corralling them back into a cohesive group he espies a procession emerging from the castle.  Somewhere within was the queen on her way to meet her fate of treason.  All cattle rounded but one, this he spots moving towards the trees and makes way to head her off.  About to reprimand the adventuresome cow, he spots a glint of metal in amidst the shadows of the copse.  He can make out the forms of many men on horse.  Just then a cry emits from within and the charge is on.  The horsemen quickly overtake the kingsmen and after a brief but bloody scuffle, they spirit the queen away.  Queen rescued again by Lancelot and his ilk, for it could only be him that could issue death so skillfully.  Distraught the boy returns to his animal companions.  Lost somewhere in the grass on that hill, Gareth’s’ sword now lies discarded.  Twenty Knights were to die that day, Gareth and Gaheris among them.  Both were said to be unarmed and were yet assailed and in that skirmish the last stroke was struck to a kingdom.

      I studied communication models a bit at some point, but with or without education it's a funny obvervation how much can be misconstrued with just the written word.  How we oft have to tread water for fear of upsetting or having to re-explain yourself.  Then there's this tendancy to think that silence means something is wrong, or even where people automatically look for blame within themself when someone else does something abrubt.

      I so almost bought Big Fish today, but then remembered the ease in which we can copy them and so I await.&nbsp; $1 dollar rental and a $2 blank DVD = sweetness in my books.&nbsp; Thought I'd share a comment I made to someone about how video games are not unlike dating.&nbsp; When the peeps heard I'd left Egypt, was all like "what are you doing tomorrow?", you have to try this game I'm playing.&nbsp; Kind of funny but that's the commitment, good games require these days.&nbsp; I got my first film developed, pretty huge for me who for the most part has been avoiding pictures for 15 years.&nbsp; Deer Lake is almost pure serenity rain or no.

      Check this, using my roommates DVD collection, to quiz myself.  1.Ever been in a place or state that you felt you if you didn't get out you'd die?&nbsp; Two years in Thunderbay, I missed my friends, road hockey, I felt very alone.&nbsp; I did find literature so the city ain't all bad, but loneliness is the worst.  2.Ever been in a situation that was so FUBAR'd because of too many personalitie's involvement?&nbsp; Family reunions were always off the hook and the drinking always made it worse.&nbsp; Movie night was often interesting, have to admit there's some I'd a never seen if I ran in differnent circles.  3.Lost a friend to death?&nbsp; Adrian played D&D with us for about 4 months, died in a car accident riding with a drunk driver.&nbsp; I have the paper somewhere and still have his pencils and dice.  4.Made a pact?&nbsp; Everytime I moved there were promises to keep in touch, but most have been lost with time.  5.Jumped off something high?&nbsp; From a bridge into the river all the time on dares, I was a crazy 10 year old.&nbsp; From a roof to dunk a basketball once, my heels of my feet hurt for like 3 days.  6.If you had a superpower what would it be?&nbsp; I'd like to be able to cure mental illness, or to be able to go without sustenance and modify body temperature  7.Pulled a prank?&nbsp; I was always putting the power out on my sitter, hehe I was a crazy 10 year old.  8.If you could live the life of another, who would it be?&nbsp; Well you don't get to hear stories about content simple people, so I'll say Adam Sandler.&nbsp; I figure he's as cool as he appears.  9.Commited a crime?&nbsp; I did get fined for littering and some community service for shoplifting, and did a few things for which I never got caught.&nbsp; All to my everlasting shame, hehe line from the Count.  10.Have a friend that you wonder how you ever hooked up?&nbsp; Yeah, for sure a couple.&nbsp; A black rapper, a heavy drinker and drug smoker, my closet friend from high school and a gamer like me.&nbsp; The third in our little trio, a chauvinist and a porn fiend, I suspect our commonality in interest I might have had something to do with molding.  11.Gave up on something dear cause someone else thought you should?&nbsp; This I've always tried to avoid, which might be why I didn't date in high school.&nbsp; I know I had to stop playing&nbsp;sports cause we couldn't afford to keep myself in shoes.  12.Ever went somewhere for explorations sake?&nbsp; A pretty broad question I guess, as this happens everytime you see a new store or wonder if there's any new movies out.&nbsp; Though&nbsp;I always take the side streets, or would cycle in random directions, wander through hills and forests.&nbsp; Been in abandoned buildings and construction sites, done door to door sales.  13.Ever been&nbsp;so nervous so as to have everything completely blow up in your face?&nbsp; I know I aced my acting debut, and most oral presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know despite much fear I think I've did ok up till now, hehe but I'm not so aroggant to think there's not plenty of oppurtunities.  14.Ever thought about a post apocolyptic world?&nbsp; From time to time, I am the romantic remember, so you can imagine it wasn't all bad.  15.Ever been afraid for your life?&nbsp; Once, my sisters father and the once&nbsp;abusive boyfriend of my mother was a complete Psycho.&nbsp; Knife weilding, starter pistol shooting (our house was on the front of the paper for that one), and many squabbles occured during those 4-6 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Served&nbsp;as a court witness&nbsp;and&nbsp;spent some time in a women's shelter.&nbsp; I've since resolved to never live in fear and that bastard is dead now  16.Ever been let down by someone you depended?&nbsp; I've been pretty lucky I guess a great system in tact around me friends and family, i've prolly been more of a dissapointment to others.  17.Been so high you have holes in your memory?&nbsp; Prolly twice.&nbsp; I was so sick but wanted to work, I gonked back way too much Nyquil and on my lunch break somehow made it to the park and passed out for the afternoon.&nbsp; Other time there's was like 10 of my friends all crammed into this little 8 x 8 room all smoking up, with little or no ventalation I guess I got totally messed up and I never touched the stuff.&nbsp; I don't remember any of things they said I did or how I even got home.  18.Pretended to be a differnent person so as to attract or turn off a member of the opposite sex?&nbsp; Done both, went to see Fast and the Furious which I knew I would hate and car shows, watched the sound of music, I enjoyed the company but she wanted romance.&nbsp; Isn't hard to turn on the obnoxious meter in a pinch, so yeah I've pushed a few ladies away in my day.  19.Had something you loved ruined by someone you loved?&nbsp; I'm sure one of my dogs chewed one of my fav G.I. Joes or wrestling dolls over the years, more recently in a video game I lost some flowers I'd been collecting and a tower I'd built.&nbsp; It hurts but in the words of a few peeps, meh, get over it.&nbsp; Stuff don't mean shit, is funny how deluded we can get.  20.Been in a exclusive group?&nbsp; Maybe but I might have been oblivious, I usually seek out the loners and try to be pretty welcoming in general.  Hey that was pretty fun and even cathardic, I'll do another 20 some other time.

      I'm in a pretty upbeat mood, soaking in the serenity that are&nbsp;my balcony neighbours the nesting birds.&nbsp; Yesterday was good, I slept and dreamt well.&nbsp; The hump that is the day of another year passing, is behind me.&nbsp; I'm reading again, which is good, has long been my second favourite thing next to road hockey.&nbsp; The Deed of Paksenarrion, book one, Sheepfarmer's Daughter is pretty good.&nbsp; Female soldier story, shades of Laurana one of my all time fav's.&nbsp; Burned both Bad(der) Santa and 50 1st Dates, so now I can see the Lil' Penguin whenever I like.&nbsp;

      Do-overs, second chances, regret, and in the words of the Priest "to my everlasting shame".  How much does shame direct us?  How often are second chances proffered?  How often are they passed, or discarded?  As much lamentation as one might come to posess, embrace fate only full of heart and empty of mind.  Then maybe new paths can be forged.  What amount of honor can overcome one ounce of shame?  I imagine it taking a lifetime of effort to discover.  Of longing I know, the emptiness that comes with absence.  Hehe, though with the words of the Count, I await to end such tenure in style.  "Missing is over", so good.

      People come and they go, dust in the wind.  Despite best efforts and intentions, they drift apart.  Worse still when the stories grow stagnant and every encounter is of days gone by, clinging to moments in time.  What of those that live on them stories, dreams of possibility but daily left behind.  Such is the story of the drifters, the dreamers, those lost and soon forgotten.

      Andy said "get busy living, or get busy dying".  I always tried to use that to motivate me, deal with station.  Seriously though, what wrong with a constant?  It's not that I fear change, is it?  Also what in our make up, let's us think we know best for others?  "I'll save him the trouble"  "You deserve more"  I shrug and shake my head, and if want to find me I'll be on my fence.

      Moon River, wider than a mile,  I'm crossing you in style some day.  Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker,  wherever you're going I'm going your way.  Two drifters off to see the world.  There's such a lot of world to see.  We're after the same rainbow's end--  waiting 'round the bend,  my huckleberry friend,  Moon River and me  (I never saw Breakfast at Tiffani's but this song is a good one.)

      "What do you want in life?" "... to be free."  These lines from a certain Hollywood blockbuster leave me questioning my own obligations, ties, entrapments... basically freedoms.  What could, should, would, I walk away from, given half a chance.  What would follow, the unescapable.  Things dragged along or haunting.  Thoughts of honor by which I try and guide this existence.  Of family both blood and serendipitated.  All the bonds we construct in order to feel safe but what when they are holding back?  Choices, exploration, experimentation, and that fork in the road.  Deferral, delegations, fear, avoidence and that sailing ship.  Loss, failures, the past, and the sunken ship.  Stories, smiles, the senses, nature, fufillment, and that bluebird soaring over the rainbow.  I might never catch it, but I'll try.

      First off, I am like a Tetris God. Which is to say I'm better than anyone I've known by far, and time away hasn't seemed to dimish my skill any. Rediscovered Primus this evening, had forgotten how much I liked them. We played some Munchkin (crazy card game), our newest cards did in fact add some needed spice and the purchase gains my thumbs up approval. Was disapointed to learn my Aunt Del was in town and didn't call me. Not only did she snub me, left my mail at my dreaded mothers. Lucky my sister loves me and is gonna go pick up. After several days with no posts, you'd think I'd have a lot to preamble on about and I DID. Except here I sit all lost, hockey having left me drained I think. Well that and several hours of Tetris while listening to my roommate download music he swears he never had owned or oven heard before and arguing movie semantics.

      "they say we lose 21 grams at time of death"  To dream or not to dream... ever heard of superficial existence or of getting ones' hopes up?  Course then there's things like serendipity, soul mates, and the lottery.  To chose or not to choose... I mean how good are you really?  Fences are pretty comfy I hear.  There will be another train right? Smile.  Trees are awesome, swaying in the wind, and wind like a caress.  A rocker on the front porch, fishing with feet dangling in the water, a cliffside sunset, and a cause worth fighting.  Absolute trust in ones eyes, a hand waiting to leed, and a shoulder in need.  All said in a glance, a mischevious wink, the secret of two.

      "the biggest fish in the pond, get that way for never being caught"  Yup listening to a Ruben Studdard tune. *shrugs* Ruben who? Exactly. Half-ass preparing for the new block season, still need some cards, sucks to not have credit cards at my disposal. Ponderings on this day are out the window, and for once was human children making noise outside. Planning on some beach time in the coming days, must hit the waves at least once. No T.V., isn't the void we feared as missing the daily sports updates ain't that huge. My roommate does demand more prime time computer hours however so the void might be my lack of communication. Not progressing in my novel so much as I'm reading other random stuff and our Munchkin deck has grown considerably as we've filled it in with recent expansions. Silly game we play far too much to be honest, considering others at our disposal which are truly great. Gonna download some more tunes and see about getting this diskchanger filled, it's like an addiction I hear.

      Through the Archway, stepping down the tiled hall, a slam of the spring motioned door. 108 step descent, avoiding the cracks in the walkway, and over the rain soaked grass. Grid of streets, nods to various pedestrians, and glances offered to the casual observers. City sign left long behind, copse's more common than commerce, and the beckoning hills. Thrill of discovery, bliss in all lost and forgotten, joy in making it back to you.

      Ok, where to begin?  The Life of David Gale officially rates second last on my list of all time worst movies, still miles ahead of The Skulls as that last movie slot has to always be reserved for something actually seen on the big screen.  About 15 mins in I said to my friend a big Kevin Spacey friend I surmised to my friend (who'd allready seen it) the entire plot.  Now I'm not the person who gloats for being right and hence smart or something, no I like being wrong.  Anyways for it showing it's hand in a predictable fashion this movie blows.  Now check this insanity: in Olympics past, female atheletes have been known to get pregnant leading up to the competition as the increse in hormones is said to help with performance.  After which they'd promptly abort.  I shake my head and am glad to have never known anyone so depraved.
