       wAo !... its 12th already ... i nvr notice so many days nvr go online... guess i was too busy ... school , frenz, projects , reports !. damn just finished a glass of sprite ( plus vodka ) . shiok shiok  today is a thursday ... hmm... went to school late .. as usual .. went for IMB presentation.. ( actually oso dunno wads going on) after that went to see our result of our micro A experiment.  after that went for lunch .. with crazy girls .. yee yan , lilies , sindhu , wei yun and ben . hmm after that went e-learning plaza finish up my micro A e-tuts also stumbled upon a blog of our classmates.. hmm.. disappointed and vex at the same time..and the 1st words i could say was WTF !! ?!?!? .... it just came out so smoothly ... reall got nothing to say. i wonder y ppl like to express their discontentment online but at the same time tarnishing someone's reputation . i suggest the good approach is to settle it once and for all .. face to face .. if i dun like a person i will shoot it out at him .. never let chance ( bo pang chance) hahhaaha ar.. enuff of wisdom words. .. hmm.. to my class .. a great job done.. espiecially mizuel .. hopes the class t-shirt comes out well... AND NICE ... about the ten-yr series thingy .. thanks ya alot ! i think it will be of a great help .  ar .. my hair is so short Lol...... but i got rid of the tired looking me .
