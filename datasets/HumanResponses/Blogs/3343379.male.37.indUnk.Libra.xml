        On Friday my five Willow action figures arrived! There is a story behind these Willows, as you may have guessed.   The original Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BtVS) action figures were produced by a company called Moore Action Collectibles (MAC). Their figures were very popular, but after BtVS was canceled, MAC stopped producing new action figures. Then, last year, MAC announced that due to an increase in demand for BtVS figures, they were starting a new line of figures, beginning with six different Willows.   I signed up as a member of their collectors society so I would have first access at buying them. I was able to buy a pre-production White Witch Willow, of which they only made 995. I then pre-ordered all six Willow figures. Sometime in March, MAC sold the BTVS (and Angel) action figure rights to a company called Diamond Select Toys (DST). During the transition, many people, including me, had their orders lost. (This is based on usefull information I read from a BtVS figures forum.)   By the time I found out, DST had already sold-out their White Witch Willows.  So I ordered the other five and in one week they were delivered to my door. Now they sit on my wall for all to admire.     urlLink Diamond Select Toys    urlLink BtVS Figures Forum

      Last night I had some friends over to watch the final episode of Angel. After five years of outstanding writing, directing and acting, the television show Angel came to an abrupt end. In fact, there are no shows on TV by Joss Whedon anymore. At one time there were three. Our only hope lies in the fact that the ending was a cliffhanger - the battle never ends. I wish I hadn't waited until the end of the 3rd season to start watching Angel - lets here it for DVDs! I thank the people who came to my house yesterday - it has been a while since I've hosted a get-together of more than three people. I wanted to take a photo of everyone but forgot. Also, next time I will have more potato chips so we don't have to ration. For tonight - leftover pizza for dinner and one Smirnoff Ice malt beverage.

      What does "Xyst" mean? I will explain soon. I recently saw Dennis DeYoung, formerly of Styx, perform with the San Diego symphony. I had been wanting to see him solo in concert for almost 20 years, ever since he released his first solo album,  Desert Moon , in 1984. I had see him perform with Styx three times and had enjoyed each concert. But at this show I got to see Dennis DeYoung do more than sing. He told jokes and made the audience laugh. He let other singers perform while he watched from back stage. Dennis DeYoung still has a great singing voice and knows how to perform in front of a live audience. I had never seen the San Diego Symphony before, and they were a great accompaniment to the music of Styx. I am glad I went to the concert. So how does "Xyst" fit in? Well "Xyst" is the name of a game that I wrote on an Atari 800 back in 1981. "Xyst" comes from Styx, my favorite band of all times. "Xyst" was written in Basic and the object of the game was to have each band member find their instruments in a series of rooms. The only copy of the game exists on a 5 1/4 floppy disc in my closet - I hope it still works. Yes, I do have the Atari 800 still.

      How did this blog get started? It involves They Might be Giants, Wil Wheaton and The Screen Savers. Read on. I was driving up to Anaheim with my sister to see They Might be Giants at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney. On the way my sister asked me, out of the blue, "What's a blog?". I told her that a blog was a web log, a journal style of web site. After seeing Kill Bill Volume 2 and eating diner at the Rainforest Cafe, we saw the concert, which was excellent, as TMBG always is. Even the opening act, Corn 'Mo, was fun. Corn 'Mo was a one man band who played an accordion and a foot symbol. Moving on. A few days later, I was watching the show  The Screen Savers  on TechTV, and they had Wil Wheaton as a guest. He was talking about computers and such, and then he mentioned that he saw TMBG last week and at the concert he talked to Corn 'Mo about blogs. Seems that Wil was at the same concert we were, and had the same converstion about blogs - scarry!. So my sister stared a blog on e-blogger, and a few weeks later, I created this blog. That's how this blog got started.  Web sites discussed above:   urlLink Wil Wheaton's Blog    urlLink They Might be Giants    urlLink The Screen Savers    urlLink Corn 'Mo

      This last weekend I went camping with some friends at Picacho State Park, located on the California side of the Colorado River. We camped at a "primitive" camp site, meaning there is no water and only a portable out-house, plus covered tables. Well, I guess it is not so primitive after all. The camp site sits near Taylor Lake, where we float around on rafts drinking beer. This time we actually ventured out to the River, where we watched boaters race madly up and down the river. We stayed near the edge, otherwise the current would take our small rafts swiftly downstream to certain peril. Below are some pictures Steve took plus a link to the park's web site. Next trip - Kern River.    urlLink Picacho State Park

      Hello World,  This is my first blog entry in my new blog. Yes, I jumped on the blog bandwagon. Now I can talk to Wil Wheaton if I see him at a concert without talking about Star Trek (a long story for another blog entry). My next blog entry will actually have something interesting in it. 'Till then,   Happy blogging Keith  P.S.  I just did a spell check using the built-in spell checker, and "blog" was not in their dictionary! Wow!

      I'm a little behind in my blog entries so it is time to get caught up. Last weekend was unusually busy for me - in a fun way. On Saturday I went to a "promotion" party for my supervisor. A person who my boss and I work for with had a party for his daughter's high school graduation, and he decided to also make it a promotion party for my boss. It was kind of strange having high school age kids mixing with us old folks. Despite being cloudy, there was enough food and drinks to make the party fun.  On Sunday I went to my brother's house for Father's Day. We all swam in his warm pool and ate some very good steak and salmon grilled on the BBQ. For this party it was warm and sunny. Even the neighborhood cat had fun.  Monday took me to see the Angels in Anaheim. I haven't even been to a Padre game yet in the new Petco ballpark, but there I was rooting on the Angles. Angle fans are so much more loyal and supportive than Padre fans. Even though the Angles were ahead by like 8 runs in the ninth, no one but us left early. We had an excuse - one of us twisted his ankle walking down the steep steps of the view section (not me).  This weekend I stayed at home and steam cleaned my carpets. What a load of fun. Now my carpets are clean but my back is sore. I rewarded myself for this hard work by going on my first bike ride in almost nine months.  Now I'm planning my summer vacation next month to Salt Lake City and Lake Tahoe.

      I just got back from a spontaneous trip to Rosarito, Mexico. My friends and I decided on Friday to go there for the weekend. The plan was to crash an Athletic Singles Association (ASA) party that my friend knew was happening down there. I have lived in San Diego my whole life and this was my first trip to Rosarito, so I didn't know what to expect. Ironically, I was surprised to see so many Mexicans, since I thought that all the clubs were filled with Americans.  After checking in to a dive hotel (with three small beds, no air and a faulty circuit breaker that killed all but one light), we headed out looking for people from ASA that my friend knew. First we went to Papas and Beer, a famous club that you might have seen bumper stickers for. We met no one there, so we headed to the Rocking Taco, where we found a large group of ASA members. After some drinks and mingling, we headed back to Papas and Beer which now was packed with partiers. After some food and more drinks, we headed back to the hotel where we didn't sleep much due to music from the hotel bar, which finally stopped around 3 AM.  For breakfast we headed south to La Fanda for a brunch, which might end up being a breakfast-lunch-dinner (bruncher?), and then we drove back across the border. Back to work I go tomorrow.   urlLink Papas And Beer    urlLink Athletic Singles

      ... stays in Vegas. I spent Memorial Day weekend in Las Vegas celebrating a friends 40th birthday. We did the usual - gambling and eating. Some of his friends arrived Friday morning, but three of us flew there in the evening.  On Saturday we decided to try to get into the pool at the Hard Rock hotel (which was across the street from our hotel). Only hotel guests can get into the pool area. However, we heard there was a way to sneak in - and it worked. The trick is to take an elevator to the second floor and then take the stairs down to the pool. Once we were inside, we got some beer and looked around. Soon we noticed that everybody had wrist bands on but us, so after a half hour, we walked out the main entrance as the security guard eyed us. Later that day we snuck into the pool at the Palms. This was easier than the Hard Rock - we just entered through the servants doors, and there were no wrist bands required. We ate lunch, which wasn't easy in the strong gusts of winds.  For dinner that night, the birthday boy wanted to go to a fine restaurant called Smith & Wollensky. The food and service was great. Most of us got the Cajun steak, which was large, tender and full of flavor. Be prepared to spend close to $100 per person, though. That was the most I have ever paid for a single meal!  That night we went to the Riviera casino to see the Amazing Johnathan. He is a comic and magician with off-beat humor and bazaar illusions, such as cutting his own arm off. I thought he was funny, but parts of his show I didn't like. For more that half the show he had a volunteer from the audience on stage, which was too long. His assistant was annoying, but she was supposed to be. I'd say if you have seen him on TV, skip the live show.  On Sunday we gambled some more and had lunch at the ESPN Zone in New York, New York. The food there was average. We played some games upstairs in the arcade. That night was our big night out. We went to Club Rubber, a special event at the Palms casino. There was long line to get in, but we had bought tickets the day before and walked right in. The club was outside at the pool and inside the Rain nightclub. Inside the club there were multi-leveled dance floors, rotating bars of lights and several go-go dancers on platforms high above. Quite an experience. Our group was way to old for this crowd, but that didn't bother us. Most of us got back to the hotel around 5 AM. After one hour of sleep, we awoke at 6 AM to get to our 9 AM flight. We were all tired, but made it home by noon. I am still recovering today. I think I'll stay in town for my 40th birthday, which is still a long way off.

      This years summer vacation, like the previous ones, was centered around a trip to Lake Tahoe with my friends. My first day took me to St. George, UT, which is a good stopping point on the way to Salt Lake City. My plan was to go for a bike ride to stretch my legs after a long drive, but the temperature was 104 degrees! So I headed to Chili's for dinner. I sat at the bar since I was alone and was happy to see that they sold beer on a Sunday. Utah has some strange alcohol laws. My eyes were tired by the end of the day so my vision was blurry. I looked at the beers on tap and ordered the Mahogany Porter. The bartender said: "Do you mean the Polygamy Porter?". I said "Yes" and the other people at the bar all laughed because they thought I said Monogamy Porter. I let them think that is what I said because it was funnier, since monogamy is the opposite of polygamy. To make a long story short, the beer was great tasting. Back at the Hotel 6, I had nothing to do but watch TV and sleep. Since the sun was setting around 9pm, it was still light outside when I went to bed.  The next day I got up early and drove to my aunt and uncle's house in Salt Lake City. This relatively short drive got me there in the early afternoon. I chatted with my aunt and uncle and then we went to dinner.  The next day I decided to go on a bike ride, since I dragged my bike with me.  I ended up riding from their house, which is in Emigration Canyon, to the top of the canyon. It was four miles of uphill and took me 45 minutes, but it was worth it. I stopped several times to rest, but knowing that some friends of mine were currently hiking up to the top of Mt. Whitney (which they succeeded in doing), I figured I could finish this little ride. I felt tired but invigorated at the top, and the view was spetacular. After resting for awhile, I rode back down, which only took me 15 minutes.  That afternoon I went with my aunt and uncle to visit two of my other aunts. We ended up going to Chuck'a'Rama for lunch, which is an all-you-can-eat buffet.   That evening, an uncle that I hadn't seen in year came to the house with his daughter and visited awhile. He is a crane operator and can't seem to talk about anything but cranes.   The next day I went on a drive through East Canyon, which is the most scenic drive I've been on recently.  I would like to ride my bike though that canyon next time, despite some steep hills. On the way, I saw a moose, who stopped in the road and glared at me, as if saying, "what are you doing in my woods?". Since I didn't have a map, I didn't know how long the road was. I ended up way out of the city on Interstate 84.  That afternoon, we went to the Olympic Village at Park City. We took a tour of the village, where they showed the bobsled course, the downhill slope, and the freestyle area.   It was kind of interesting to see that they can train all year around, without snow. The surfaces of each slope behave like snow. The day ended with another dinner and I had to get ready for the long drive the next day.  After saying goodbye and thanks to my aunt and uncle, I headed west on I80. With no delays, I made the long 576 mile trek across Nevada to Lake Tahoe in 9 1/2 hours. The only event that I encountered was a large fire in Carson City, which was burning houses and producing thick smoke. Once at the house that my friend rented for the week, I was able to relax with a beer. This house was huge! It was three stories plus a large deck on the roof with a view of Take Tahoe. My room was on the third floor (with the first floor being on the top, and the third floor on the bottom). After a week, my legs were worn out from the walk up and down the stairs.   On Friday we spent some time at the beach at Zephyr Cove. I was the only adult to brave the cold lake waters with a swim. Saturday was the day of the softball tournament. The team won the first game, but lost the next two games to two really good teams. Since this meant elimination, we had all of Sunday free.  That ended up being our biking day. We have this route that we always take, and for the first time I got to ride my own bike instead of renting one. We bike to a cafe near Camp Richardson, have lunch, and ride back.  Monday was a good day to go hiking.  Only four of us decided to hike. We started at Fallen Leaf Lake and hiked up to Angora Lakes. The trail was steep but we all made it. At the lake, there was all sorts of activity. You can drive to this lake, rent a boat and dive off rocks. We bought some famous lemonade, rested, and headed back down. As usual, my knees were hurting by the end.    My last day in Tahoe was spent on a boat. We rented a pontoon style boat for a half day. We also rented an inner-tube which is easier than waterskiing - at least for the kids. When I tried to get into the tube, I threw my shoulder out of socket - which really hurts - twice. I'm still recovering from that injury. Everyone got a good laugh at my disasterous attempt to go tubing. I had better luck when I swam to the island in the middle of Emerald Bay with the kids. We jumped off some rocks into the lake before swimming back to the boat. We also realize that no one knows how to use an anchor. We amused several onlookers while we struggled for 15 minutes trying to anchor the boat.  On Wednesday I drove home. This time I did encounter a delay - the freeway was closed heading into San Diego due to a chemical spill. That delayed me almost two hours. I got home around 9:30 pm and then had to get ready for the Comic-Con, which you can read about in my previous posts. There is much that happened on this trip that I didn't cover, but I had fun as always. I need to thank Steve and Ann for organizing the trip and renting the house. Trip mileage total: 2000 miles. Average miles per gallon: 26.6. End of story.

      Sunday was the last day of the convention. I wanted to see two panels: Joss Whedon:  Serenity  and  Wonderfalls : Unseen Episodes. Joss Whedon is always entertaining, and this year he had a surprise: the entire cast of his movie  Serenity , which is based on his canceled TV show  Firefly  . The hall was packed with at least 6000 people, and he got a standing ovation - the biggest I've ever seen. When he announced the cast they also got a standing ovation. Lots of good questions were asked and the entire panel was obviously happy at the positive response from the fans. Looks like this movie will do well (unlike the poor response from the trailer for  Anacondas ,   which got boos from the audiace in an earlier presentation.).  After that panel ended, I stuck around to watch two unaired episodes of  Wonderfalls . Unfortunately most of the room left. I guess, as the producers put it, everyone who watched the show was in the room. They did some Fox TV bashing, but overall the three executive producers were upbeat about the future of  Wonderfalls  after its DVD release. The two episodes were just as good as the four that were broadcast. I will buy the DVD which will have all 13 episodes for sure.   Sadly, Comic-Con was over. I headed home with some Angel and Simpsons figures I had bought and got ready for my return to work after two weeks of vacation. Boy, am I exhausted!

      Saturday at the Comic-Con is always the best as well as the most crowded. You get used to being hit by backpacks, lightsabers and angel wings. The first panel I attended was The Simpsons with Matt Groening and various producers and directors. The discussed the upcomming season 17 and answered questions. No big announcements, but it is always fun to hear Matt speak. He admitted that he has been attending the Comic-Con as a fan since 1978, which would explain the episode of The Simpsons in which he appeared as himself at a comic convention.  Due to an overlap in programming, I missed this years Star Wars Spectacular with Steve Sansweet. Other than his announcement of the title for  Episode III: Revenge of the Sith , I didn't miss his babbling rhetoric about how great the Star Wars universe is. In the afternoon, I attended a panel on action figure sub-culture. It was interesting to her about the state of the action figure/toy industry from the presidents and artists of small-time toy companies.   I sat through the last part of the  Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow  panel, which didn't impress me. I guess I'm not a Jude Law fan. I was really there in Hall H to see the next presentation:  The Grudge.  The two co-stars were there, Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) and Jason Behr.  This was Sarah's first appearance at the Comic-Con and she handled the audience like a seasoned convention pro. She was funny and witty, and had no&nbsp; problem answering the obsessive fan's questions. She even read a list she wrote of why this was her first time at the Comic-Con. Her number one reason was: There isn't enough merchandise with my damn picture on it!   After a dinner that included my first boxty, an Irish food, and some more beer, I returned to the Con to watch the Worst Cartoons ever. Some of these cartoons were so bad they were funny. Others were so bad they were painful to watch. The guy behind me was laughing so much I had to move because he got annoying. Finally, I went to the Masquerade Party/overflow out in the "sail area". They needed an overflow for the overflow! There was no room to watch the show on the screen that was set up. So I headed to the trolley and then home.

      Friday was a long day at Comic-Con. I finished walking the dealers room, taking some photos along the way of up coming action figures I might want to buy, including such Buffy figures as these Darals here.  &nbsp;There were also prototypes of new Spike, Anya and Tara figures. I was happy to see a line of "Family Guy" figures. However, the though of starting a new collection frightens me - where will I put them?   I attended&nbsp;four panels: Sci-Fi: Battlestar Galactica, Eliza Dushku, Science Fiction Museum and New Line: Return of the King, Harold & Kurmar, Blade III. &nbsp; I really wanted to see Eliza Dushku, who was there to promote her show "Tru Calling", since I missed her last year. She was a great sport in handling obsessive fans and was enjoyable to listen to. The other panels were just OK for me. I was tired by the end of the night, but still had energy to go with friends to the Hard Rock Cafe for dinner and beer.

      I just got back from my first day at the Comic-Con. Today I bought many nifty action figures, including two sets of the Charmed Ones. After buying the first set, I found out that there was also a set of CineQuest exclusives, so I bought them also (a discount if you buy them as a set). Add a wind-up Nibbler, two Buffy/Angel ornaments and one Simpson's action figure and you have a very large, heavy bag that I had to drag to dinner, on the trolley and on&nbsp;a five minute walk to my car.   I only went to two panels today: a&nbsp;summer movie preview and an action figure discussion. Both were just OK. Tomorrow I'll finish walking the dealers room, buy some more&nbsp;action figures&nbsp;and attend more&nbsp;panels. Hopefully I'll also have some pictures to post as well.

      Well I finally made it to Petco Park and saw the Padres play the Huston Astros last night. We got there early, before the gates opened, so we had time to walk around and find the best food and beer. Let me start my saying that the people working at the park and the concession stands in particular are extremely friendly and helpful. I hope it stays that way. They were all ready to serve me as I walked by the stands eyeing the beer and food choices.  First the food. I was happy to see more than just hot dogs and burgers for sale. They had food from Oggi's Pizza, Rubios and Gorden Biersch. I ended up eating a chicken burrito from Rubios and was pleasantly surprised that it tasted better than a burrito from a regular Rubios! It had more chicken and cheese, and less of the "filler" ingredients like rice. It made the $7 price seem reasonable. Because the burrito was so big, I wasn't hungry enough to try other foods. That will have to wait.  Next the beer. A few weeks ago I was at the Angel's stadium in Anaheim and all they had was Budweiser and Bud light. Petco had all the usual suspects plus the premium beers Stone Pale Ale, Oggi's California Gold Blonde Ale and Gorden Biersch Marzen, all of which I had, for $7 each. I also saw heineken, Redhook ESB and other semi-premium ales. Going back to their great service, each vender made sure my glass was filled to the top with beer, not foam, and they cleaned off any extra beer that spilled on the sides. I don't mind getting beer on my fingers - really!   In conclusion, the whole experience was enjoyable, even though the Padres lost. Oh, that reminds me, I watched a baseball game too. Almost forgot about that. The game was almost a secondary event after the beer and food. I will try to get to another game soon. I have no excuse since I work near a trolley stop.

      Keeping with my current exercise and health craze, I hiked to the top of Iron Mountain this morning. This was the first time I have hiked it alone, and without someone else to keep pace with, I walked too fast at the beginning and was very tired by the time I got to the peak. From the top you have a good view of the area burned by the big fire last October. In fact, I saw a fire burning off in the distance. I used the telescope at the top to look at the fire and saw aircraft dropping water on it. Why didn't they do that last October? I wasn't worried about the fire reaching me, since all the brush was still burnt. It looked like a volcano exploded - if you have ever been to Mount St. Helens you would know what I mean. It took me one hour to walk up and one hour to walk down. I was the last person off the mountain - the sane people will hike it in the evening when the air is cooler. It is now time to rest my legs and get ready for my next local adventure.
