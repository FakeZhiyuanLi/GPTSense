       Kickoff  So Long, Farewell and Auf Wiedersehen to Andi. Seattle just became a less interesting place to live.   Free Music Free   urlLink PBS  has a new edition to their  urlLink Frontline  series of programs titled  urlLink The Way The Music Died . It is an in-depth look (well, as in-depth as television gets, let's just say one or two levels deeper than Hard Copy) at the losses incurred by the Music Industry over the past 5-7 years (minimal losses, I might add, more contraction than catastrophe). The program will also examine the last 35 years of the industry from the rapid post-Woodstock ascent through the introduction of MTV, to the current sounding of the death knell. I've read all the information PBS has published on the site, and while I don't expect this to be a stunningly accurate or unbiased portrayal, it looks like a good way for the average PBS watching public (slightly more savvy than the typical american) to peel back some of the layers of hype and hysteria covering their eyes and ears.   Private Message  Yo, dude. Yeah, you across the way. If you're gonna do that, CLOSE THE FREAKING DRAPES! Don't get me wrong, we were all entertained, but the next tenant might not be so understanding.

       Kickoff  Me and my big stupid mouf. As soon as I start extolling the virtues a Sunny Seattle Spring, we get hit with a freakin' thunderstorm yesterday, and the ubiquitous steady drizzle today. Sorry neighbors, my bad.   NerdAlert  Hey, speaking of ubiquitous, check out this awesome article on the  urlLink Third Paradigm Of Computing . It's a nice, easily undestood article, but probably only of interest to nerds. Links to more detailed info for the super-nerds among us.  (This is why I use Google to spellcheck. You never know when you might get so much more than just the correct spelling and definition.)  Speaking of the future, I just spotted on  urlLink GirlHacker  that a portion of the  urlLink Experience Music Project  here in Seattle is being converted into the world's first  urlLink Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame . Opening on June 18th. The thirteen year old,  urlLink Heinlein  &  urlLink Asimov  worshipping,  urlLink Zork  playing,  urlLink Thomas Dolby  listening, proto-geek inside just siezed control of my brain. Yurt!

       Kickoff   urlLink Chaos on the Cusp    Free Range  We're in a run of absolutely gorgeous weather here in the fair city of Seattle. I've taken this opportunity to reacquaint myself with what a great town this is for walking/running/biking/etc. Yesterday I took 3 hours after work, and managed to take in all of the Myrtle Edwards park (along the coast of the sound), and a good chunk of the Burke-Gilman Trail (along the top of Lake Union). Sun was shining, birds were singing, bees were trying to have sex with them  urlLink (as is my understanding) ...all in all, just about the best afternoon I've had in a while. The only downside is, I now realize I need an MP3 player with a much bigger capacity. Anybody want to sell me their IPOD on the cheap?   Free Music Free  It's no great revelation to say that the music recording and distribution industry has a comprehensive track record of momentously stupid decision making and political alignment over the entire course of its history. The Music Business has long been the sanctuary of that not-rare-enough cross section of people incapable of succeeding in either music or business. Their truly ridiculous stance on the evolution of music file compression and sharing, while not without precedent (the RIAA represents many of the same corporations that were wetting themselves when radio began broadcasting), may be the absolute nadir of their collective cultural disconnect. If you are looking for some actual facts on the subject of file-sharing, try this report:   urlLink The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales - An Empirical Analysis  by the University of North Carolina and the Harvard Business School.  Here is a snippet (but please, read the whole thing, as I am an obviously biased opinion, and we all know editing is a kissin' cousin of lying)   We find that file sharing has no statistically significant effect on purchases of the average album in our sample. Moreover, the estimates are of rather modest size when compared to the drastic reduction in sales in the music industry. At most, file sharing can explain a tiny fraction of this decline.  ...  The business model of major labels relies heavily on a limited number of superstar albums. For these albums, we find that the impact of file sharing on sales is likely to be positive, leaving the ability of major labels to promote and develop talent intact. Our estimates indicate that less popular artists who sell few albums are most likely to be negatively affected by file sharing. (Note, however, that even for this group the estimated effect is statistically insignificant.)  ...  File sharing lowers the price and allows an apparently large pool of individuals to enjoy music. The sheer magnitude of this activity, the billions of tracks which are downloaded each year, suggests the added social welfare from file sharing is likely to be quite high.

       Kickoff  I have an extra ticket to a production of  urlLink Stephen Sondheim's  play   urlLink Into The Woods   tonight at 7:30pm. Drop me an e-mail if you want to come along.   Friends & Relations  Today is my Grandfather's 83rd birthday. Happy Birthday Saba!  Also...the two friends who are leaving for Hawaii in a few days have been the catalyst for all of my recent drinking and partying. I'm feeling a bit of dread that when they leave, some of the responsibility might fall to me to keep our circle of drunkards and louts spinning. Or, it might just be that I'll really miss them.   Now Spinning   urlLink Beyond the Missouri Sky (Short Stories)  by Charlie Haden & Pat Metheny The song on this album called  The Precious Jewel  is one I could listen to all day and all night for a week. A very affirmative piece of music.

       Kickoff  Attempting to make a left turn against traffic in Seattle is a million times more frustrating and depressing than the 200 days of rain every year. People in this town are just incapable of performing this rather simple operation with any degree of efficiency or aplomb. Coming from LA, where it was considered a solemn birthright that three cars get to make the left turn after the light turns red, this drives me absolutely batshit. People absolutely refuse to make the turn unless there are no cars approaching, the light is solid green and shows no indication of changing, and there are no pedestrians within a 300 yard radius. This usually results in a maddening one-car-per-signal-rotation average. I had to leave LA and start driving in Seattle to develop road rage. That, my dears, is irony.   Top O' The Morning  Last night was the first time in six straight nights I did not stay up drinking until last call. I spent a quite night at home, and was asleep before 11. I woke up this morning absolutely born again. Still got to work half an hour later than I wanted, but at least I was able to file it under ennui, instead of fatigue from fighting the onset of total system failure.    Farce As Weapon of Mass Distraction  To elaborate on my previously stated political stance, last presidential election I voted for the libertarian candidate. Not that I would consider myself a hardcore libertarian, but that particular brand of radicalism applied to today's current political scene would at least cause enough of a correction to move the system as a whole towards my current ideal.  [rant] I was planning on following the same route this year. While I think Bush is a bad president, I was not particularly interested in any other candidate, and felt that it was more important to use my vote as an expression of disgust against the two-party system. Then, Bush chimed in on the whole same-sex marriage issue by saying he  urlLink supported a constitutional amendment  that would "honor marriage between a man and a woman, codify that". To give full disclosure, Bush said he believes that same-sex marriage is a state, not a federal issue, "except and unless judicial rulings undermine the sanctity of marriage; in which case we may need a constitutional amendment."  Here is the part that pissed me off. Pissed me off enough to decide on the spot that I would vote for whomever I felt had the best chance of defeating Bush. "...undermine the sanctity of marriage...". Are you fucking kidding me? That is  precisely  what such an amendment would do! Not only that, it would undermine the sanctity of the  urlLink constitution ! That can't be good for the country, can it?  Here's the deal, as a heterosexual with a desire for marriage, I would like to insure that the institution of marriage maintains at least a modicum of honor and prestige, if for no other reason than so that I may enjoy those benefits when I myself marry. Allying marriage with the precepts of exclusion, intolerance, and discrimination would devalue and dishonor marriage far more significantly than allowing people who some might find abnormal to participate in marriage. If a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage is a reality at the time I marry, I will feel cheated.   The second point, is that the constitution was founded as a document that grants basic inalienable rights. The only exclusions against people present in the US constitution are those related to the age, citizenship status, and country of birth (for President only) of elected officials; and restricting votes to people over the age of eighteen. That's IT! All other statements of exclusion on the constitution limit only the government. Adding an amendment to prevent certain people from a legal institution flies in the face of the entire cumulative history of the constitution. That is freakin' outrageous. [/rant]  So in a nutshell, I'm voting for Kerry. And I feel incredibly dirty for doing so, but hopefully I'll one day be able to console myself with a wedding ceremony free of guilt, to a person of whatever gender, race, religion, creed, or status I choose.   Inspiration   Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.

       Dearly Departed  The baddest motherfucker ever to pick up sticks passed away today.   urlLink Elvin Jones 1927 - 2004  One of my favorite recent CDs is  urlLink Autumn Leaves  by The Great Jazz Trio. I bought that CD because I was on a  urlLink Hank Jones  kick, and heard some good cuts on the radio. By the time I had listened to the whole thing twice, I could barely even hear Hank's piano anymore. Elvin had completely enthralled and enraptured my senses with his drumming. He was playing mostly with brushes, yet I swear my feet were shaking from the soundwaves out of my headphones. Elvin just hit the skins so damn hard, it was unbelievable. Endlessly inventive, and beautifully spiritual in his playing. My condolences to Hank Jones (now the only surviving brother of Jazz's Three Kings; Hank, Elvin and Thad), Elvin's wife Keiko, and their entire family. Wherever great jazz musicians go when they leave this world, I'm sure Coltrane is thrilled to be back with his old running buddy.

       Kickoff  How could I not love this page?  urlLink A Qabalistic Interpretation Of Dr. Seuss'  Green Eggs and Ham   My discovering it today dovetails so nicely with my current reading material  urlLink The Hero with a Thousand Faces  by Joseph Campbell, and the recent launching of this blog.   Dearly Departed  Today marks the third anniversary of the suicide of  urlLink Susannah McCorkle . Perhaps the most interpretive female jazz/cabaret singer of all time. No vocal gymnastics or dynamic hysteria, just a sublime ability to expose the truth of life through familiar phrases and tunes. The perfect antidote to American Idol.  RIP, Susannah.   World At Large  My favorite part about  urlLink this story ? The thief was on a bicycle! Imagine trying to pedal through the streets of LA while lugging around a freakin' cello. No wonder he eventually just dumped the thing.   Now Spinning  Music:  urlLink Most Requested Songs  by Susannah McCorkle Television:  urlLink Sports Night   Sports Night is one of the best written shows I never expected to love. Some of the dialogue leaves me gasping for breath. This line completely knocked me out when I first heard it:  I understand what makes a woman think that any man is better than nothing. I'll just never understand what makes a woman think she's got nothing.   I'm on my third time through the complete series in consecutive order. And still my therapist insists I don't have OCD.    Emotional Weather Report  Two of my friends are moving to Hawaii in about 10 days. When I first heard of their plans, ninety percent of my brain was ready to take off with them. I have moved at least once per year for every one of the last 6 years, and it had been nearly exactly a year since my latest move. The opportunity seemed like fate. Then some other part of me identified it as regression. I've had an interesting life, but I can't say I've ever felt particularly fulfilled. I'm always trying to break patterns in my life in order to grow and develop as a person, but it hit me that transition had become the most stable attribute in my life. Habit can be a sneaky beast to detect. I am very glad to be staying, Seattle has never felt more like home.  For the record, here are the places I've lived: Los Angeles, CA: 1977 - 1998 Seattle, WA: 1998 - 2/1999 Reno, NV: 2/1999 - 11/1999 Seattle, WA: 11/1999 - 2001 Anchorage, AK: 2001 - 2002 Wasilla, AK: 2002 - 2003 Seattle, WA: 2003 - Present  You may notice that I've never been more than a days drive from the Pacific. I feel very deeply spiritual about that ocean. When I meditate, I often picture myself walking into the ocean, and slowly being broken apart and dissolved into the waves. Freud would have a field day with this, and Joseph Campbell might be compelled to invoke  urlLink Atanea . I don't care, the Pacific is still my first true love.

       Sweatshop Blues  Somebody at work today tried to sell their X-BOX system on the company e-mail list set up for such things. They somehow slipped in to the message that they were selling the X-BOX because they were about to move in with their girlfriend. This apparently elicited a veritable flood of sarcastic comments and/or manly outrage from all the serfs in our little geekdom. The seller ended up running a poll to determine whether he should keep his girlfriend or his X-BOX.  Final Tally -  Keep Girlfriend: 18 Keep Xbox: 29  No wonder Take Your Kids to Work day was awfully quite around here...  P.S. - He sold the X-BOX.

       Kickoff  My deepest apologies to all the good folks at the  urlLink Timberline  for hijacking their humble lodge. I swear, I didn't know any of those people, including myself.   Congratulations Kris!!   Evolution In Action  Even if they pass all of their classes, do we even want  urlLink these people  raising children?    World At Large  Now here is a really good idea. Imagine if there was a process our country could go through now that would, over the next 50 years, yield tremendous advantages to our economy, health care system, and public health. But it will be a little more expensive for some companies over the next 3-5 years than the  status quo , so I give it roughly a snowball's chance in hell.   urlLink Trans-Fattastic!    Now Spinning   urlLink The Easy Way  by The Jimmy Giuffre 3   Sweatshop Blues  [bitch&moan] One of the companies I work for is a billion dollar technical enterprise capable of developing highly advanced commercial technology and speeding merchandise around the globe with effeciency deemed previously impossible. Ventilation, however, seems to be beyond them. There are giant metal tubes with grating running along the ceiling that supposedly provide some form of "air conditioning", but the internal climate remains a balmy 80 degrees, and the only things in worse condition than the stale recycled air are the stale recycled employees breathing said atmosphere.  But that's OK, because as soon as this job is over I get to run downton to my second job, where I will inhale the relatively luxurious potpourri of mass-transit fumes, used coffee gounds and the occasional pungence of Seattle's finest wandering inebriated. [/bitch&moan]   Everyday Hero   urlLink Saint Hubertas  What the link fails to tell you is that Good Ol' Saint Hubert is also accredited with inventing that spicy-cold sip of love and evil we modern folk refer to as Jagermeister. I don't know about you, but enough of that stuff and I'm seeing crosses just about everywhere, and could probably predict the time of my death within a solid hour.

       Kickoff:     Props to Andi for the inspiration.   Top O' The Morning  I've reached the point in my dubious career as an alcoholic where I wake up for work too tired to have a hangover. While I certainly appreciate the free pass on the whole headache/vomiting/drymouth routine, I sometime wonder if it wouldn't be a rather small price to pay for the ability to keep my eyes open at work longer than three minutes.   State Of Affairs  Yeah, right. Who are you kidding?   World At Large  Read the  urlLink Yahoo! Buzz Index  for the first time today. Appalled and amused, which is probably the intended reaction. The part I found most horrendous was the female gaurd in the whole Iraq prisoner torture scandal referred to as the "Smokin' Pfc. Lynndie England". Just out of curiousity, is our society even capable of perceiving any woman without filtering her through the ever present hotornot pageantry? Most times I don't care, but I get the occasional feeling that the collective sexual obsession of our civilization is causing us to simply whiff on some pretty important information we might just need to stave off obliteration one of these days. When that day comes, I'm pretty sure I'll be off laughing in some isolated corner. Phtbthtbthtbthtbtht!   Just For Fun:   urlLink Fuck Clear Channel!

       Kickoff  I like rabbits.   Free Music Free   urlLink Copyrights & Copywrongs  The above is an interview from  urlLink Stay Free!  Magazine which deals with the historical evolution of copyrights in the US, focusing on the key paradigm shifts in 1909, late 1960's, 1976, and the late 1980's. It certainly helps give perspective on the current upheaval, which I suspect will be remembered long after the other debates have been forgotten.

       Kickoff  Minor Cold + 8 hours work + 3 Martinis + Impromptu (and fully clothed) dip in Lake Union = Sickness.   On the plus side, having no voice today will probably keep me out of that conference call I have scheduled.   Free Music Free  As you have probably figured out by now (you being the hypothetical people reading this blog on a regular basis, so far a total of zero judging by commentary (maybe it's because I haven't told anybody about it?)) (and yes, I just used sub-parentheses, and now I'm using parentheses in sequence. I'm ADD, get used to it), I spend a good portion of my life obsessing over the future of music distribution and the music industry in general. But let not it be said that I only criticize, and never propose solutions! Here is one concept I would like to see explored to handle artist compensation in the future.  Here's the basic conundrum as I see it: In a digital world, possession of anything that can be rendered digitally is basically free. There's simply no getting around it, for reasons I started to type, but deleted as I got to page three and was still simply stating the conditions for my argument. Suffice it to say that if you don't agree with me, then you probably have way more faith in both technology and people than I do.  If the product is free, how does the artist make money? The key (at least to my perspective) is that perfectly reproduced digital copies are free and easily distributed  once they exist . So one solution would be to base artist income not on distribution, where there is no profit margin (if cost=zero and price=zero, profit ain't gonna be much), but on release.   Hypothetical situation: People who like the music of an artist want to hear more of their music. If I listen to a song by Public Enemy and like it, I will most likely be willing to pay money to hear future songs by Public Enemy. Demand exists. Currently, PE capitalizes on that demand by releasing the music in a distributed format (CD). So when I purchase a CD, I am not paying for the songs on that CD, but instead for the convenience of having those songs made available to my location. No wonder the record label makes the majority of the profit, as they are the one providing the actual service. In essence, PE has given away their work to the record label in exchange for a (miniscule) slice of the profits from the label's work. Digital downloading basically destroys this model, as I can personally cut out the distributor, thus cutting off the profit source for both the label and PE.   So what if PE were to realize that distribution is a dead economic model, and instead tie their profit potential to release. PE states on their website that they have composed a new song, and provide a title and perhaps a short sample. PE then sets their own price for the release of the song, to whatever they believe the song to be worth (much like a painter setting the price of a canvas at a gallery). People interested in owning this song make contributions to a fund. When the fund hits the pre-selected price point, the song is released in a digitally downloadable format. PE never makes another dime off of that song.  This has two benefits. First, it deals with the reality of digital distribution, instead of trying to suppress an inevitable outcome. Second, it levels the artistic field into a more democratic, capitalist system. Currently, you have two options as a popular musician, rags or riches. There is no middle ground. The labels exist to produce stars capable of selling millions of records, and take no interest in anything else. This results in homogenized, music of the very worst stripe. Allowing artists to make a moderate living from releasing their music will discourage people with no interest in music, only stardom, and will encourage people with a love for music but without the requisite image required for stardom.   It's not a perfect model by any means, and there are certainly many holes to poke. But I wanted to get a new solution out there for discussion, instead of just joining the millions who bitch & moan about the current system.

       Kickoff  Here's the thing, and the thing is, listen close cause this is the thing: I was wrong. Consciousness in no way shape or form leads to reality. It is entirely possible to know, imagine, absorb, project and digest a concept without the slightest ripple of actual physical manifestation. The neural net is a crap shoot, or perhaps more accurately a baccarat turn. Tie goes to the runner, the one with the lifetime of momentum providing the near unstoppable existential thrust. Change a thought? Easy as standing under a falling apple. Change a reality, a specific space-time event, even in the potential? Not so much.

       Kickoff  The upside of socialism:  urlLink BBC to Open Content Floodgates    The downside? Stagnating economies, insufficient routine health care (gotta love the catastrophic coverage, though), rigid social stratification, etc...    Tumbleweeds  More thoughts on the new Seattle Central Library:  I like this place more and more with each visit. There are some glaringly boneheaded errors (the architect just assumed that everybody would much rather wait for a crowded elevator to go everywhere rather than take stairs or escalators - duh.), but the overall flow of the library is functional beyond all previous conception. I know this may sound weird, but the entire library is actually designed to make it easy to find books according to the accepted cataloging standard! I know, stand back. Also, the book return slides are cool, very retro-future. It's a shame that they will have to take them down after the second or third rugrat loses an arm. Oh, and the CD collection still sucks, unless you have an undying love for showtunes and christmas compilations.   NerdAlert  Another pre-historic remnant has been found, this time in the Atlantic off the coast of Berlin.  urlLink Ratfish  My favorite part is that the species was named  Hydrolagus matallanasi  after the Spanish scientist Jesus Matallanas. Can you imagine working your whole life in a specialized field, finally becoming a world-renowned icthyologist (with all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto), and they name a freaking Ratfish after you? I mean, thanks guys, but wasn't there some cool new shark or piranha, or even a boring old species of carp that needed a name? It had to be a ratfish?

       Kickoff  Happy Birthday Allison!   Caution: May Contain Common Sense  Don't you just hate it when smart people get together and make really good suggestions to improve all of our lives?  urlLink Doctors Urge Easier Access to 'Morning After' Pill  How are providing access to and educating people about birth control ever considered bad ideas? Seriously, where is the social benefit of denying anybody these things? What does the government hope to gain by blocking this? I am baffled. I think the problem is, we have outgrown leadership, at least on a macro-social scale. Expecting one person (or in our case, one idealogical cabal) to provide socially acceptable and intelligent answers for the entire array of national problems is just asking way too much. I'm starting to see the appeal of parliamentary government. I will now go beat myself over the head with a very large book ( urlLink Atlas Shrugged?   urlLink The Charterhouse of Parma? ) for typing that last sentence.   I hope I'm crazy, because if I have to live as a sane person in this insane country, I'll go mad.   Dearly Departed   urlLink Ralph Wiley , author of far too many to count classic sports columns as well as many wondeful books, passed away at the age of 52. Some people believe that his writing was too incendiary, that Mr. Wiley took too many opportunities to step on people's toes. To which I must reply, you're daaaaaaamn right. Read  urlLink All that jazz in NBA playoffs  to get a gauge on his enormous talent, then read  urlLink Lay off the hot dogs  to get a sense of how he could polarize people so effectively.  Thank you, R-Dub, for making me think. My deepest condolences to your family.   Now Spinning   urlLink Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book   urlLink Blind Love  by Mary Woronov. This book is making me miss LA so much, I threw on a copy of  urlLink Swingers  last night.   818? 310. Ohhhhh.  I finished  urlLink Ella Minnow Pea  last night. The story was better than I expected, but it was kind of hard to get a grip on the author's intent with this story. It was either too realistic to be a fable, or too shallow to be literary fiction. Not to say that being easily classified is any great virtue, but for me the impact of the story was lessened by being constantly uneasy with the casualness of death and suffering, which I felt could have been properly balanced by a solid grounding in the world of fable.

       Kickoff  Saw an actual movie in an actual theater last night for the first time in ages. (I believe  Return Of The King  was the previous experience, when my whole department took the morning off to see the movie. Working for a dotcom is doing wonders for my inner geek.) I strolled up to Queen Anne and checked out a little independant called  urlLink What the #$*! Do We Know!? . It was good, but unfortunately not great. The premise is that a bunch of quantum physicists, neurologists, theologians and behavioralists get interviewed about such topics as quantum mechanics, brain topography, addiction and free will. Then a fictionalized account of these topics is shown by following three days in the life of photographer/recent divorcee (and extra-super-duper hottie)  urlLink Marlee Matlin .   The main problem I had with the film is that the first 30 minutes or so is so endlessly fascinating that I was anticipating a spectacular film, but then the filmmakers veer off in another direction, without explanation. Now, I understand that they were trying to turn what really should have been a 4-part  urlLink Discovery Channel  series into a 2-hour movie, and that involves some necessary editing and focusing. I'm just disappointed that they abandoned their most interesting (IMO) premise to focus on a topic of much less ambitious scope. In their defense, however, I will say that they did an absolutely masterful job of setting up a moment of revelation. I'm just not entirely sure that the one moment, upon later reflection, was really worth the half hour of relative banality that preceded it, even if it was absolutely necessary to give the emotional impact that seeing the eyeliner mendhi declaration of self-love delivers.  Still, don't let my misgivings dissuade you from avoiding the latest FOTM drivel and supporting this film instead.   Now Spinning   urlLink Man In The Air  by Kurt Elling. Another free pickup at the J-O-B.  The Uncertainty Of The Poet  is brilliantly wacky. I've collected many a strange look singing along to that little gem, believe you me. I just finished  urlLink VOX  by Nicholson Baker. Have to say I was expecting more. I had heard all these reviews when it came out years ago about how the form was so unusual and disjointed, and instead I got a straightforward conversation between a couple of pseudo-intellectuals. This morning I started Mark Dunn's  urlLink Ella Minnow Pea: A Novel in Letters . It looks like unusual form will be offered in abundance, but I'm less than optimistic about the content. We shall see.   Inspiration   Once I opened my eyes, and I felt like laughing...but the mountains were mighty solemn...but for that matter, so was I...and in fact, laughter is solemn.

       Kickoff  Welcome Ezra!   View From The Well  Right Brain/Left Brain Analysis from  urlLink Mindmedia    Sam, you possess an interesting balance of hemispheric and sensory characteristics, with a slight right-brain dominance and a slight preference for visual processing.   Since neither of these is completely centered, you lack the indecision and second-guessing associated with other patterns. You have a distinct preference for creativity and intuition with seemingly sufficient verbal skills to be able to translate in any meaningful way to yourself and others.   You tend to see things in "wholes" without surrendering the ability to attend to details. You can give them sufficient notice to be able to utitlize and incorporate them as part of an overall pattern.   In the same way, while you are active and process information simultaneously, you demonstrate a capacity for sequencing as well as reflection which allows for some "inner dialogue."   All in all, you are likely to be quite content with yourself and your style although at times it will not necessarily be appreciated by others. You have sufficient confidence to not second-guess yourself, but rather to use your critical faculties in a way that enhances, rather than limits, your creativity.   You can learn in either mode although far more efficiently within the visual mode. It is likely that in listening to conversations or lecture materials you simultaneously translate into pictures which enhance and elaborate on the meaning.   It is most likely that you will gravitate towards those endeavors which are predominantly visual but include some logic or structuring. You may either work particularly hard at cultivating your auditory skills or risk "missing out" on being able to efficiently process what you learn. Your own intuitive skills will at times interfere with your capacity to listen to others, which is something else you may need to take into account.    My ex-girfriends would all whole-heartedly agree with that last sentence. Memo: They wouldn't call it Attention Deficit Disorder if it wasn't all three of those things.

       Dearly Departed  The Greatest Musican In The World passed away today.  urlLink Ray Charles 1930 - 2004   I've always said that if I had to choose one musican as the best of the 20th century, my vote would go to Ray Charles. His voice defined soul music, he was one of the world's great arrangers and producers, he was a jazz musician who played with and was admired by legends such as Nat King Cole and Milt Jackson, and he invented a new sound a new role for the black musician in America. I can hardly conceive of a tribute worthy of his passing.  There are very few who are granted the gift of genius, and fewer still who posess the intelligence and determination to use that genius to change the world. Mr. Charles exemplified that rare confluence.   In his own words:  When I'm gone, remember to pray 'Cause there will be hard times, hard times Who knows better than I?    Meaning of the blues right there folks, wisdom through suffering.  Amen, Brother Ray.

       Kickoff  Walked out of my apartment this morning into the most fascinating rainfall I've ever seen (and I've lived in Seattle long enough to see quite the variety). It was a very very light mist, being blown all around by a swirling wind. Reminded me a lot of the "Cool Zone" misters you see on football sidelines or at Magic Mountain. I walked a block to my car and didn't feel a drop of rain, but had to wring out my clothes before sitting down. Wonky.   Nowhere Fast  That whole Czech Republic thing...not so much. I don't really know what happened there, but it ain't happenin' any more. It did spark some interest in me to do a little traveling. I'd really love to visit Greece. If I start saving all my extra money now, I should accumulate enough funds to spend roughly the last 4 minutes of my life in Athens.   Litra-chure  Has your Ritalin prescription run out? Do you have a hard time getting all the way through Cliffs Notes? Then you need to visit one of my favorite sites:  urlLink Book-A-Minute . Quick and dirty summaries of classic literature.

       Kickoff  I've been given the opportunity to travel to the Czech Republic later this year, and I'm debating whether or not I should go. My initial reaction was no, simply because it would put me knee-deep in the muck of some family politics I've made it a policy of avoiding. But the more I think about it, the more I think I will go. I've been talking a lot with a European friend of mine about the social differences between Europeans and Americans, and I think experiencing a different cultural mindset for the first time as an adult (I traveled a lot more in my youth) would be enough of an enriching experience that the result might overcome the method. Plus, lord freaking knows I need a vacation.   Sweatshop Blues  My favorite part about working the 2nd job (coffee shop) is the nearly limitless opportunities to ridicule Bovine America. Americans seem to focus the majority of their insecurities on money, status, relationships and appearance; watching these folks decide which overpriced calorie-bomb will most impress the prospective ex  du jour  in thirty seconds or less is a most entertaining collision to witness.   NerdAlert  And here I thought that  urlLink Cosmic Latte  required Schnapps.    View From The Well  Here is the top candidate for Fact About Me My Friends Would Be Most Shocked To Discover: I am a card carrying (figuratively speaking) memeber of the  urlLink Secret Society Of Happy People !   Now Spinning   urlLink The Third Decade  by The Art Ensemble Of Chicago How can you not a love a group that makes a bicycle horn as integral a part of a nasty funk groove as the bass line?  urlLink Understanding Movies  Technically a text book, but a fascinating pleasure read. I had skimmed this book in the past when I roomed with a film student, and stumbled upon it in the library. I really love the shot-by-shot breakdowns of classic scenes from such films as  urlLink The Battleship Potemkin  &  urlLink North by Northwest . Truly a fun and enlightening look at the art of cinema, and one that manages to show respect for the complexity and sophistication of the art without resorting to elitist exclusive bullshit.

       Kickoff  My grandmother, who turns 80 in November, left me a voice mail message in Czech (her native language) yesterday. She had meant to call her sister. It's hard not to be depressed and worried about her state of mind, but since this is the first incident of this kind I've ever experienced with her, I'm going to be optimistic and chalk it up to a speed-dial mistake.   Free Range  Finally checked out Seattle's new  urlLink Central Library  last night. It's very cool and modern, but in a frustratingly old-fashioned kind of way. They've built this awesome structure to house all these books, incorporated this genius spiral ramp design for the book stacks, and then shelve the books on discount-grade metal racks with no aesthetic or functional elegance whatsoever. It's like they blew the whole budget on certain aspects of modernity, and let other parts of the library remain downright ancient. For instance, the automated self-checkout allows you to take home most items without even scanning them, just by placing them on a special pad. But they only accept cash and checks. The librarian who I spoke with told me that the "Library doesn't have that kind of money." I sort of wondered if they could have skipped the video installation on the escalators (which caused a huge  urlLink Adventure Through Inner Space  flashback) and used those funds to pay the Visa service charges for the next, say 10 years?   Nitpicking aside, it is certainly one cool building. The recorded music collection still sucks, and there is no acknowledgement of digital publishing, but it might be the worlds best place to browse for a book, find a cool one, then sit and read it. I guess that is about all one should expect from a city library, no matter how futuristic the architecture. One of these days I'd like to see a privately funded for-profit library opened by a tech company compete with the government institutions. I bet there's enough margin floating around to make it worthwhile, especially in a city like Seattle.   Free Music  Clear Channel is once again attempting to deny music to music fans. What a fabulous business model.  urlLink Clear Channel Limits Live CDs  Fortunately, it looks like their patent is more or less  urlLink worthless . Maybe they are just trying to drain the funds of their smaller competitors through frivolous legal action.

       Kickoff  Phase two of operation "Restore Seattle's Liquor Reserves" officially began with the departure of Jen for greener pastures (Hawaii, the little ##$@#@!). Best of luck, and thanks for all the lifts home, even the ones I wouldn't accept.   Obsessions  Today being the first of June, and with yesterday being the unofficial start of summer, you know what time it is, right? Yup, time to sing  urlLink Christmas Carols ! As if my constant impromptu caroling wasn't annoying my co-workers enough during the actual holiday season, they will now all be treated (tortured?) with my raspy and tuneless renditions of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" & "Little Drummer Boy" while cooking in the 80 degree sun! Isn't life grand?!?!?!? Isn't it???? What?   Free Range  Sunday afternoon (after work and the requisite post-work  urlLink Guinness ), Antonela (friend/co-wroker) & I strolled on down to the  urlLink Northwest Folklife Festival  at the  urlLink Seattle Center . It was a great ooportunity for people-watching (read: pointing and laughing at freaks), but was a bit of a disappointment as an actual festival having anything to do with folk and/or life. The worst part was the freakin' beat-offs (drummers, to you non TMB'ers). I've seen these people at the Seattle Center on just about every reasonably sunny day that I've been there over the past six months. One or more ragged groups of 30-50 minimally trained, semi-directed percussionists will stand on the lawn and play partially coordinated drum rhythms. This seems to please the tourists ( Bovinae Bos americanus ) to no end, but really pisses me off.  [rant] Here's the deal. Drummers are people who spend the majority of their life in the cross-hairs of a rather cataclysmic sonic event. If one were to attempt to develop a process of quickly & reliably attaining immediate and long-term hearing loss in humans, repeated concussive pressure waves in close proximity would be a near-perfect solution. Drummers voluntarily subject themselves to this. Their hearing begins to deteriorate. They play louder. Repeat  ad fuckin' nauseaum . Musicians find this cycle painfully hilarious, as drummers constantly attempt to leech themselves on to the musical family tree, yet treat the very essence of musicianship (listening to others) with wholehearted disdain.   Back on track: These stupid drum circles were in full-force at FolkLife, and they managed to just about ruin every other musical performance. I saw no less then three sanctioned musical performances by a variety of actual folk peformers grind to a screeching halt in order to wait out the pointless pounding of the semi-human brigades of noise-o-philes. Drummers are fascists, and they deserve the fascists fate.  (Note: I have utmost respect for musicians who play drums. Such rare and gentle folk are excluded from the scornful epithet "Drummer") [/rant]   Boom-Boom Bap   urlLink Pulitzer Prize Broadens Criteria for Music  It's cool to see that the committee is embracing improvisation as an art form that deserves as much consideration for recognition as composition. 70 years late, but at least they finally came around.   Now Spinning  The Lost Chords by Carla Bley One of the great things about working where I do is all the free swag that's just lying around. I don't know where it comes from, or how it got to my desk, but some of it is really cool. Like this CD. Carla Bley, of all people, gets her funk groove on with Steve Swallow, Andy Sheppard & Billy Drummond.  urlLink Unsung Heroes  by Tierney Sutton. One of my all-time favorite recordings. If you haven't heard of Tierney, listen to this album ASAP. If you have heard of her, and have carelessly lumped her in with the rest of the female jazz vocalist revival (Norah Jones, Diana Krall, Patricia Barber), listen to this album AFSAFP. Unbelievably musical performances.

       Kickoff  The very definition of "damned with faint praise", from  urlLink Ain't It Cool News   " I, Robot is the best thing since Episode 2 "  errrrr.....right. That really gets my juices flowing.   Say What?  The other quote of the day, from  urlLink Jacqueline Passey   " Bryan Caplan...is the   urlLink  Dungeon Master for an all economists Dungeons & Dragons game   !!! Can you think of anything cooler than that??? "  Yes, yes I can. Here is a list of things cooler than that: 1)Everything 2)That's it, that's the list.  No offense to the brilliant Ms. Passey (whom I frequently enjoy reading and plan on voting for in her bid for Secretary of State) or her  amour du jour,  but let's get serious. When it comes to people I would rather not hang around (in descending order) there are nerds, geeks, Trekkies, the violently insane, the comatose, and then D&amp;D economists.   From Behind  Here is another image from my past. The Truckee River in Reno used to run literally right under my balcony.  Wait, there was all sorts of grammar going on there. Allow me to clarify. The Truckee River in Reno still runs under the balcony of the apartment in which I used to live.  There. Here's a picture, now shut up.      Now Spinning  Eliane Elias -  urlLink Everything I Love  Eliane is a brilliant pianist. She reminds me of Keith Jarret in hardbop mode (without the "goat being poked in the genitals by a burning stick" bleating, of course). I even like her singing, but I'm a big fan of personality over technique in singing. (Ever heard me sing? I sound like Neil Diamond swallowed Tom Waits) Also, I should point out that today I listened to the song with the best title,  EVER!   "Mitch Better Have My Bunny"  from  urlLink Songs From The Analog Playground  by Charlie Hunter. That title couldn't be funnier if I were on crack.

       Kickoff    urlLink Gizmodo  has a fantastic article on the possibilities and problems of e-books. Frankly, the e-book is long overdue. I had a workable model of this thing in my head when I was eleven. Like flying cars for the tomorrowland generation, the e-book not being a ubiquitous fact of life is a major dissapointment for twenty-some nerds worldwide. As to the DRM question, the author is too quick to dismiss the possiblilty of a new wholly capitalist compensation model for artists. The current system does not pay artists, it pays distributors. Don't make the mistake that something is right just because it works. One of the core buzzwords around my job is "scalability", and frankly, the current retail model of artist compensation can only be profitable on a global scale. There's a reason why Costco hasn't driven everybody else out of business, and it's the same reason that needs to be exploited to create a viable niche for "middle-class musicians".   Soul-Searched  Went back for another round of hypnotherapy yesterday. This one was much more cliched (although no clucking was involved). I felt like I was on the verge of sleep most of the time, and at least half a dozen times I felt myself slip out of conciousness into very vivid waking dreams. The strange part is that some functional partition of my brain was still responding to the questions from the therapist in a quick and concise manner. Plus, I was running on about 4 hours of sleep after a 16 hour work day, so the hypnosis doubled as one of the best power naps of my life.

Well, aside from the music, of course.    Of course.    Say It Isn't So  At the tender age of 26, my life has definitively and without recourse turned the corner into middle-age. I just joined a bowling league.  Now, this isn't your standard beer-gutted, foam-swilling, ass-crack displaying, balding, smoking, cursing bowling team (I will be, in fact, the only contingent of that sub-species (emphasis on the sub)).

       Kickoff   Happy 64th Birthday Bugs Bunny!  On July 27th 1940, Warner Brother released the Tex Avery production  urlLink A Wild Hare , featuring the first appearance of Bugs Bunny. Voiced by Mel Blanc, that "wascally wabbit" would go on to become a shining example of grace under pressure to millions of schoolchildren, members of family  rodentia  and budding transvestites.  Happy Birthday, Bugs.       Feeelm   Last night I rented the second disc of   urlLink Six Feet Under: The Second Season  and watched all three episodes. I really am starting to believe that the one-hour serial may the perfect format for cinematic storytelling. Most movies either feel stretched or squeezed to fit the preferred 100-minute box. The truth is, some stories should be told quickly, and other stories need time to develop. 1-hour TV shows allow you to accomplish both, as the multiple storylines let shorter arcs have quick resolutions, and the implied hold on the audience across episodes lets longer stories develop without feeling forced. I'm almost ready to include Six Feet Under among my exclusive list of television shows that can actually be considered "art", along with  urlLink Homicide  &  urlLink The West Wing .  (No, I did not forget The Soprano's. While I liked the show a lot, it definitely wasn't pantheon level material for me. I understand that banality in inherently dramatic situations creates tension and anticipation, but it is still, well, banal.)  I also rented  urlLink Bad Lieutenant , but probably won't get a chance to watch it until Wednesday.

       Rev  Those things I couldn't remember? I remembered one of them.   Saturday was Darlene's birthday! She had a party that night, which featured a suitably eclectic guest list. If the entire party were to be personified as a single individual, it would be a bitterly enraged exhibitionist cowboy hippie geek with a sweet tooth, black lung, &nbsp;and the giggles. Good times. The party also featured my second ever game of Kings, which I guess is the drinking game all the kids are playing these days.

       Kickoff   Life has been insanely busy since my last update, and I can remember at least a dozen times I thought "this will make for some good blogging". Unfortunately, I can't seem to remember what happened directly prior to said thoughts. So my recollection is limited to a string of feelings that something happened to me, sometime. Very annoying    Follow   My dad finally got moved out of the ICU on Friday night. He says he still is in some pain, but he appears to be on the right path to recovery. If all continues to go well, he should be home in one or two days.    Echo   Today is the ex-girlfriends birthday. Last year at this time we were still together, but things were disentigrating rapidly. Life has changed so much since then, I can't even imagine myself being with her. All my memories seem like they came out of some book I read. I think that's a good thing. Happy Birthday, Christina.    Life Baby   Got some serious drink on last night. Started after work when my plan to go home and watch Kids In The Hall on DVD was short-circuited by the contingent of supervisors on the way to a meeting, who practically tied me up and dragged me into the bar with them for a bracer. Of course, I was still drinking when they left for their meeting, so we made plans to meet back at the same place (the very elegant 727 bar in the Hyatt) when they were done. Which left me with plenty of time to A)wander around belltown listening to old-school rap B)eat sauerkraut and drink cherry vodka fizzes C)show up early, and pound 12 dollar Chopin martinis. Needless to say, they didn't show up. So I left the bar, walked back to work, started to walk home, and there they all were again, in front of Dragonfish.  So we went in for some more drinks.  Now, I should mention that the wait staff at Dragonfish hates us.  HATES  us. And with really good reason. But we didn't care, and we suffered the strange looks as Nela regaled us with highly inappropriate tales of her&nbsp;15 knot enema, and Lil' B and BFM traded rap lyrics back and forth.  The nice thing is, I had to drive home. So I was sober enough to take Excedrin before I went to sleep, which meant no hang-over today. Sweet.   Here is the night in Haiku    We know you&nbsp;hate us    But your drinks are so damn cheap &nbsp;  Fuck You,&nbsp;Dragonfish     &nbsp;   Dearly Departed   Illinois Jacquet, one of the all-time legends of the Tenor Saxophone, passed away Thursday evening at the age of 81. Most people remember him as the wellspring of the "gutbucket" style, with all the yelps and honks (think Zoot of the Muppets). In truth, he was one of the most versatile of all players, having been their from practically the beginning and always staying current. He was also a fabulous and ambassador, and he opened the minds&nbsp;of countless rural and inner-city youths to the possibilities of jazz. RIP.   &nbsp;

       Kickoff   My favorite place in Alaska was the beach facing out towards the Portage Glacier. Floating chunks of ice, random unidentifiable mammals (Voles?), Picnics in 60 mph winds, and all sorts of strange memories. Don't know why they popped into my head this morning, but here is a picture of the glacier for the&nbsp;y'all to enjoy.  (Picture from  urlLink www.alaskanessences.com )    &nbsp;       View From The Well   Yesterday I had my first experience with hypnotherapy. I had been more or less looking forward to it all week, as it sounded like a very cool experience. It was, more or less. The funny thing was how in control I felt. It felt like I was just playing along with the game in order to give myself permission to be truthful and direct where I would normally be coy or evasive. There were some moments that were beyond the usual scope of my experiences. 3 or 4 times, I felt memories that were far more vivid than what I normally recall. I could hear sounds that came from the memories, and feel remembered sensations in a very immediate way. My therapist didn't spend too much time poking around or getting personal, it was mostly plannting messages and affirmations.  If nothing else, it was very relaxing. Like getting a cortex massage. I have a few more scheduled in the near future.    Now Spinning   Finished  urlLink Success  last night. The last 30 pages or so were really quite brilliant. I only wish the rest of the book lived up to those standards, but as it stands I doubt I will be re-reading this. I understand the need for authors to slowly introduce character traits and histories in order to create impact in the final chapters, but it is a rare skill when the author is able to make those experiences fresh and captivating enough to create a consistently high level across an entire novel. Some good examples are  urlLink The Mysteries Of Pittsburgh  by Michael Chabon &  urlLink The Fortress Of Solitude  by Jonathan Lethem.   Next on the reading list is  urlLink Learned Optimism  by Martin Seligman. It's the first psychological text I've read in a while.    urlLink Belly Of The Sun  by Cassandra Wilson  I love listening to Cassandra sing, but for some reason I have been less and less interested in her latest releases. It's like she's following a path that just doesn't interest me. But bless her for staying true to her art, and not bending to the intense commercial pressure caused by the recent female jazz singer trend.

       Kickoff  Dad's resting in ICU after his surgery. So far everything appears to be 5X5. Relieved doesn't begin to describe my feelings. Thanks to all the mojo and prayers floating in the ether for his success and recovery.   Haiku Corner  From  urlLink http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HaiKu &nbsp;- The greatest bit of meta-poetry I've ever experienced:   HaiKu's inventor must have had seven fingers  on his middle hand   My own contribution:   Five syllables first   Seven syllables go here   Five more syllables   And since I'm on the kick:   Sam I Am, I Am   Sam, I Do Not Like Green Eggs   And Ham, Sam I Am    &nbsp; Look for more of my convention flaunting haiku in the future. At one point I converted the entire  'Twas The Night Before Christmas  into haiku. I'll see if I can dig it up.

       Kickoff   Talked to my Dad this morning, about an hour before he was scheduled to be prepped for his surgery. He seemed pretty happy,&nbsp;confident and well informed.&nbsp;Also in the room were his Mother, Daughter, Wife, Niece &amp; Sister. He's probably looking forward to some hard-core anesthesia right now, just to keep from drowning in an estrogen tidal wave.  P.S. I would really like to thank the good folks at Cyberjammin' for their kind words, humorous responses, and well-tested mojo.  &nbsp;   Night &amp; the Music   House party at&nbsp;Los Bachelorette Pad last night. Very grateful for the opportunity to hang out with friends and drink. Precisely what I needed after yesterday's news. Highlight of the evening had to be Alicia and Leslie busting out the old school dance moves so hard that the CD player started skipping, creating a really self-defeating&nbsp;(but hilarious)&nbsp;cycle of: Running Man&nbsp;&nbsp;-> fix cd player -> Cabbage Patch -> fix cd player -> Hammer Time -> fix cd player....  Good times.  &nbsp;

       Friends &amp; Relations  My mom just called me at work, crying her eyes out. Turns out my Dad needs emergency quadruple-bypass surgery, which they are going to perform tomorrow. I'm so not fucking ready for this. I'm just sitting here, trying to picture myself on a beach, sun-shining, boat drink at the ready, and no concept in the world of time or date. Guess I have a happy place. Who knew.

       Kickoff &nbsp;  Don't ever ask me in passing what I did this weekend. You will invariably get the following response:   Um.....wait. I don't remember...errrr....I know I did something...lessee....   And so on and so forth.  I have serious issues remembering what I've done and where I've been on any specific day. I have no idea if this is just from working seven days a week for two years, so one day just blends right into the next, or if I have serious repression/recollection issues. Not that I particularly care one way or the other, but just a PSA to you overly friendly sorts looking for casual interaction.  &nbsp;  Friends &amp; Relations  My dad had to go to the emergency room last night, they thought he had a heart attack. It turns out it was just a blockage. He was scheduled for&nbsp;an angiogram next week, but they've bumped it up to today. He's had a host of health problems in recent years, and things are really boiling in the last few months. Speaking to him gets kind of depressing, as his feigned resolve and inherent optimism coalesce into a rather sinister form of denial.&nbsp;I would recommend therapy for him, but frankly, I'm not near straightened out enough in my own mind to take on his burdens. But I wish him the best.  &nbsp;   Now Spinning    urlLink Success  by Martin Amis  Really really fucked up, but also engrossing. I'm about half done, and the format is starting to bug me a bit. The story is told in alternating viewpoints between a pair of radically different foster brothers and roommates, and each one tends to contradict the other. I like the way this forces the reader to take a more active participation in the story, instead of being mindlessly fed a prescribed perspective. However, just alternating between the two viewpoints seems a little unambitious. I would love for Amis to start mixing in perspectives from some of the auxiliary characters, even if only for short stretches.  &nbsp;   Whine   Just a friendly reminder to my faithful and devoted readers (all none of you). My birthday is just about one month away, and Apple has conveniently released a new version of the  urlLink iPod . Or you may choose any one of the hundreds of splendid items from my  urlLink Wish List . Start saving!

       Free Music Free   &nbsp;  Just about every person in the blogosphere with an interest in music or technology is posting this document, but it is funny, and it is important, so I'm adding to the clutter.  &nbsp;   urlLink The Obsessively Annotated RIAA letter to the INDUCE Act    Nothing like the truth to smack down some old-fashioned hype.   Some highlights for the short ah-tension span crowd:    &nbsp;We don't have a performance right on radio and therefore derive no income from radio play. [Welcome to the wonderful world of "when Congress tries to dictate business models." And so, the RIAA proposes a sequel.]   &nbsp;Our economic vitality is based on generating hits – finding special talents that enjoy strong commercial appeal. [And we should care about the hit-maker mentality, because?]   &nbsp;In our business, the hits are what allow investment in genres that do not accumulate great sales, such as jazz, classical, bluegrass, and the blues. [What a bunch of philanthropists the RIAA is. They take their profits and invest them in less popular genres out of the goodness of their hearts. God bless 'em!]    &nbsp;  Gosh, I sure am glad that a slice of the profits Jessica Simpson is making is going right into the promotion of jazz and bluegrass albums. Wait, whaddyou mean it isn't? The RIAA just said it was. That's why the record companies continue to allow great jazz artists to make records with all the time and resources of pop stars. Don't they? And why they continue to record jazz artists who do not recoup the companies investment in their latest record. That is what they do, right? They just said so. Gawsh, where's my local A&amp;R rep. I just wanna give him a big ol' hug.

       Kickoff  "Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime..." Tupac Shakur   Live From Seattle  Last night I scored a last minute ticket to see   urlLink Nanci Griffith  perform at the  urlLink Woodland Park Zoo  by Green Lake.  Let's recap: Wednesday Night Suburban Seattle Aging Folk Singer  In a nutshell: I've never  seen  so many white people all in one place. Fresca consumption must have taken a serious downturn for three hours.   All that aside, it was a nice evening. Great place to see a concert, especially with the utter fabulousness that is the Butterfly Enclosure/Beer & Wine Garden. Whoever came up with that idea is brilliant. Kids got in free, and my goodness did they ever. There were at least two-thousand ankle-biters running around that lawn. Not to mention you couldn't throw a nickel in the air without hitting some neo-hippie engaging in a little public breastfeeding. Not that I have anything whatsoever against that, but after a certain point it gets to be a little much. I didn't know whether to blink or go lactose intolerant.

       Kickoff  To sleep...perchance to dream...dream of sleeping...while sleeping...and dreaming...   Music On The Internet  As my legion of devoted readers will happily attest,  urlLink All Music Guide  has been one of my favorite resources on the web for quite some time. Well, now they've gone and updated their website. Aesthetically, it is quite the upgrade. The old block letters and yellow frames had a decidedly 90's feel. Unfortunately, usability has taken a hit. And really, the place is an information resource at heart, so usability should really have been the prime motivating factor in any re-design,  non?  My biggest complaint - what the freak happened to the freaking scroll bars! Why should I have to wait for a complete re-load just to finish reading a paragraph? Just one more step in the general devolution of the internet from organically connected data resource to 1960's billboard and strip-mall heaven gone digital.   Belling Cats  Just made plans to visit family in New York over the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. I hope I can pry enough time away from the festivities to enjoy The City. I love New York. Not as much as LA, and Seattle is really growing on me, but I really do love being in New York. That there city is sho' nuff done up righchall.

       Kickoff  Another all-nighter in the tank, this one courtesy of Lil' B's return from Cali. Apologies due to the staff (as it were) of Cafe Mecca on Queen Anne, and those crazy kids in apartment #1.    Lit-ra-chure  Check out the  Words Words Words Project *  ...the rules are...steal it, post it on your site, bold the books you've read and add three of your own....so let's go...  WAIT! Before we go, my comments in advance, because how many of you (in the mythical sense, I'm still convinced absolutely no one has actually read any part of this blog) really are going to scan down to the bottom to see my comments.  Observations: 1) Bloggers are a big honkin' buncha nerds (can we get a few more Terry Pratchett/Neil Gaiman books in there folks?) 2) I'm suprised how many of the books I labored through as high school reading assignments appear on a list of books people are ostensibly reading for pleasure. Maybe I should go back and apologize to a few teachers, and the occasional dead author. 3) If you look very closely, you can see that I have never read any of the Harry Potter books. Not even a single word. There are still 19 of us remaining, and we live in constant fear of government reprisal. Remember me when I'm gone.

       Kickoff  This is so horribly bad, no-good, wrong that I promise to kill myself as soon as I stop laughing... (from  urlLink FARK )

       Kickoff  Are people what they do, or do people do what they are? Discuss...   Weapons of Mass Distraction  Recapitulating my political stance this election year:  urlLink JohnKerryIsADouchebagButImVotingForHimAnyway   However, I actually got a little bit excited when I heard he selected  urlLink Senator John Edwards  as a running mate. I like Edwards. I like that Edwards is not an experienced politician, I like that he actually worked for his high-class degree and demonstrated his understanding of his education through actual practical experience, and I like his nearly *gasp* libertarian economic ideas. Sure, some of his social values are out of whack with mine (He opposes gay marriage, is way too pro-union for me), but he was my sentimental choice to win the democrats nomination. Plus, his "Two Americas" speech is the most populous rousing bit of political oration since Bryan's "Cross Of Gold". Let's just hope Edwards isn't near as misguided.

       Kickoff  12 hours of sleep last night, and still no let-up in the sickness. I Googled "viral bronchitis" looking for a possible remedy, and only ended up with the dire warning that the viral infection can take weeks to disappear, and symptoms may remain for up to 3 weeks afterwards. The condition is so lengthy that "acute bronchitis" includes anything up to 3 months! 3  freakin'  months?!@?! That's really stressing the definition of acute. No go on the remedy, but I already knew that. Anybody who found a cure for a viral infection would probably be receiving their Nobel prize right about now, not commenting on a WebMd message board.   Now Spinning   urlLink Ballads, Blues & Bey  by Andy Bey My first exposure to Andy Bey, who is experiencing a by-all-accounts well deserved resurgence in the jazz world. I love listening to this album, his voice is so singular and his phrasing so damn bluesy. Not revolutionary music, but sure to charm the pants off any reasonably sophisticated potential paramour.    urlLink Already Dead  by Denis Johnson Subtitled "A California Gothic", and he ain't kidding. As Gothic as it gets, I'm only 100 pages in and already I need to double down on the sunshine and puppy dogs to lift myself out of the emotional mire. Dark as can be, and I've yet to meet a realistic female character, which tends to be my problem with almost all fiction. Maybe I should start reading more female authors. Feel free to suggest.

       Kickoff  Flying in the face of all fiscal responsibility, I went ahead and ordered cable TV to be installed this Friday. Really, the only reason I need it is to be able to catch SC games this season. But I certainly have missed watching  urlLink The Simpsons  without the squiggly reception lines, and the added entertainment will be helpful in curbing rental costs, since I had to sell nearly my entire DVD collection for quick cash. I'm now only one couch short of being a couch potato.   Litrachure  Last night I went to my first meeting of a reader's group at the Olive Way Starbucks. Not a book club, this was just eight people sitting around talking about the books they either are reading or have just finished. Really fascinating ideas, especially when the talk wound around to religion (as talks are wont to do (and can you tell I'm on an alliteration kick today?)). Of course, afterwards I felt so incredibly nerdy that I had to go shoot heroin, hire a hooker, and steal some kids lunch money just to restore balance. Good times.   Now Spinning   urlLink Galatea 2.2  by Richard Powers The library filed this under Sci-Fi, and the cover art sure is trying hard, but nobody is convinced, least of all the author. This is Powers getting his self-referential "woe is the writer" novel out of the way. Rite Of Passage, professional obligation, last-ditch effort, or simply too good an idea to pass, for whatever reason every fiction writer of the past 50 years seems to have one of these on their resume.  Not that there is anything wrong with that. As a matter of fact, I am really liking this book. The science of neural nets and artificial intelligence is developed in an interesting manner, although Powers hedges his bets both by dialing down the scope and casually blurring the line between explanation and speculation. Still, the best of the multiple threads in this book is still the present-day attempts of a multi-disciplinary scientific team to create an artificial intelligence capable of matching wits with your average mid-western undergrad (the phrase  managing expectations  may be overused in election years, but if the shoe fits...). The only time the book bogs down for me is in the endless ruminations of the author over his lost relationship. Hopefully, this emotional backgrounding will wane as the book moves forward.   Inspirations  One of the oft-quoted passages in the above book is from William Blake's  urlLink A Poison Tree      I was angry with my friend; I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow.   Taking this excerpt out of context, I was reminded of one of my favorite quotes, mistranslated by Rafi Zabor (probably from some other source) out of  urlLink The Gnostic Gospels of St. Thomas :    If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.

       Forced Perspective  is the name of the game. I hear the lies and theories of the multitudinal complaint, where two millon eyes create one million worlds on one canvas. I don't buy it. Speak to me only with thine  intention . Fuzzle and warp the edges with cherubi or sun-rays, ride those force lines into that nexus of discovered three dimensional power. The visual Bach, with his three part inventions for two hands and one board transformed from the creative to the observed. You can do it. This is the key to argument, and photography, and classicism, and  noir.  Take that power point, and hammer it home until the hyperthalamic bitch screams for a little respite. Choice is apportioned like wafers at Mass, like virus on the subway. The lies of unique are subverted and superceded by the intention of a will long since passed, once in the future. Stick that in you common good and smoke it. We are part of what we were, more so than what we are.

       Kickoff  More farkin' silliness. This is my childhood fantasy come true.  TRANSFORMERS VS. SMURFS   Revenge of the 80's cartoons     Now Spinning   urlLink Hot House Flowers  by Wynton Marsalis. Wynton is Wynton, which is cool. But Branford...man, he's Branford. Big brother steals the show on this CD, and bless his pop-loving heart.

       Kickoff  Hung out with BecMo & Nella last night at  urlLink Six Arms  on Pike. Really, really excellent beer. I thoroughly enjoyed the Hammerhead, which had a slight honey taste behind the hops, and the pitchers of Pale Dog Daze Ale were hella cheap. Of course, the best part was listening to those two all night, as they are some mos' talkingest ladies. Total hilarity ensued, donchaknow.   Pico-Eco  I'm down to the mattress on the financial front. Sold off the majority of my DVDs today. I actually enjoy divesting myself of worldly possesions. My inner buddha is clapping his hands with anticipation of a barren environment. I also think it is much more sophisticated to have stacks of books around the house (which I am rapidly accumulating, thanks to the magical free shelf at work) than stacks of media. Adding to this austerity is the fact that I have ripped the majority of my music to MP3 over the last two months. I really only listen to music on my ghetto Rio or on the computer anymore, so I've trimmed my CD collection in half. So in recap, Bad News=Broke. Good News=Growing Up.   Visualize  Continuing the photo tour of my past:     Here is a great photo of the Huntington Beach pier where I used to hang out with my cousins when we were staying at our Grandmother's place in Sunset Beach (yes, there really is a Sunset Beach. Yes, I practically spent every weekend there as a kid. Yes, my life did, in some aspects, rawk.)  Also, check out this  urlLink totally awesome coastal view  of the entrance to Topanga Canyon from Pacific Coast Highway. I grew up on the other side of these mountains, and aside from the spectacular scenery, it was always a strange and spiritual experience to take the cosmic karmic tumble from the palisades, through the burn-out canyon, into the bland suburbia of the valley.
