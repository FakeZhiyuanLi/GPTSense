      So my first thought is that capitalization may be not very interesting in the blog world.  except for em phasis.  and what about punction - overrated or may somewhat be useful.   this could be the space of poetry actually...    depending on how it gets displayed

      so i have had enough of the cicadas.  we have been overrun with the buggers. you can hardly walk on our property without stepping on one. mo likes to eat them which makes her stomach gurgle something fierce but at least doesn't make her sick. nice day today on the long weekend - tackled the alley again and have it just about under control from the weeding - no allergy melt down so that is good.  walked to dinner always a pleasure to see kashmir. worlds shortest dog walk due to fireworks fear of the pup. tornados north and south of us yesterday - thank goodness they didnt come through here...

      so here i am trapped in the bedroom - bubble boy - after a the first major allergy meltodown of the season.  oh they are horrible - i think i've blown my nose about 200 times today alone.  maybe it will pass.  you feel so helpless when taken over by the sneezing fit.  so look at are photogs from last weekend and they look great!  now we have to decide what to do with them and how many we want.  worked too much this week - 53 hours. anything over 50 is problematic to my pysche i think.  got a copy of the john mann band rough cut from the studio and it sounds great.  the i need a drink horns will be adding to the ablum in june so that will be fun.  missed going to the studio to play accordian today due to melt down.  sucks.  i must go check on the dog she may have locked herself in the basement...

      so i am not as young as i used to be.  understatement.  good night of revelery with matt n following a good turn out happy hour at shenanigans.  whirlwind evening starting at 6 shenanigans, 9 off to bearnos then off to the outlook (early) for a final night cap.  everyone peeled off from there to go home and go to bed round midnight.  i should have but didnt and matt and i hit the old ale house, molly malones (2$ cover at 2am?) and the outlook again....long fun night but paid for it today.  but much better now. a little of the hair of the dog tonight may help - off to a nice dinner with s and j prior to their trip to puerto rico A has returned from london town yippee! tomorrow it is a day of the photo with dog we have been trying to pull together for about 4 years.  it will be nice to document us in this moment.... cheers
