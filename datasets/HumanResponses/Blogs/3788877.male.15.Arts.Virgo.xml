      'Grandpa always said "The best stories: the ones most remembered and loved, are the ones that are true."'  -Kayd   The sun rose like a great king, spreading it's glory far and wide. Light was given to the land once again, and all around life had begin to stir. The gentle stream caressed the banks of the forest as a lonely colt stood, gazing at his reflection, wondering what would become of him as time passed by. Would he be a mighty stallion like his father, master of the forest, free to run with the wind, or a hapless gelding fated to be killed before his time?  A sound from the east aroused the attention of the young colt. Before he could recognise what it was, a swiftly thrown noose wrapped around his neck. The colt struggled with all his might, but soon more ropes flew out, followed by cheers of joy and victory. Three old men walked up towards the defeated young horse.  "Another great catch, eh Rob?"  "Yeah, this one'll be a gift 'fer me daughter, Jakeb. A nice, tame young'un she can learn to ride,"  The colt threw his head up and called out for his mother. But, only silence replied, and told him he was all alone, without saying a word. Realising it was all up to him now, the young colt thrashed about, catching one of his captors in the groin with the force of the great stallion buried deep inside of him, sending the man to his knees in pain.  "Hahaha!!! Mick, the 'lil bugger got ye good ey?"  Mick lay sprawled on the forest floor, replying with an indifferent moan. Rob winced in sympathy for the poor man, but chuckled under his breath.  "Er...on second thought, do you want 'em, Jakeb?"  "What's the matter, Robb'o me lad? Too big 'fer ya? Haha! ...okay, I'll have 'em, but gimme a hand tyin' up his legs first. Don't wanna come home to me wife a 'lesser man', ey Mick?"  With that, the men tied up the now exhausted young horse, and put him in the back of a rusted old van. The stallion in him subsided, and looking back, he realised that his days in the forest were over.

      "The Beginning and The End… Life and Death… Truth and Lies… Light and Dark… Good and Evil… Existence and Nothingness… Love and Hate. Everything is made of opposing forces.  Long ago, when the land was barren and young, the gods of our world fought an epic battle, deciding on which opposing force would be superior. Since the world was bare, the only weapons they could use were the powers they had been created with.  The god of Divinity, Dalin, and his followers had the powers of life, light, and creation. They used their powers to give energy to this planet, create living creatures, and the sun that shone from high above the clouds to give warmth to the entire world.  However, the god of Chaos, Faron, and his loyal minions had the powers of death, darkness and destruction. They used their powers to destroy everything they could, creating barren deserts once more across the world, and diseases that plagued all living things. Darkness rolled across the world, and many of the inhabitants of our world were destroyed.  Some survived, and with the aid of the Divinities, were given the power of healing, magic and creation. These demi-gods worked with their creators, and drove the evil back into it’s own darkness. The land was restored to its state of serenity, and the creatures began to rebuild the world. New shrubs were planted, animals were created, and illness had disappeared once again.  All was peaceful for a time, but after many years of harmony, the evil inside the creatures was slowly beginning to show. Some mastered the destructive side of the magic. Minor arguments turned to fights, and it wasn’t long before the world was once again at war.  The gods, seeing what the creatures had done to their world, decided to reclaim the powers of magic from the people. They came down from the heavens and stole back the powers, leaving the people powerless once more.  They sealed the powers inside a crystal, and shattered it into 10 pieces.  Each piece was scattered across the planet, and embedded into only the most true and worthy of people. These beings had the power of the gods stored deep within them, and each their own unique task to complete; a driving force for their very existence. The tasks were a test, to see whether these creatures could truly learn to control such powers. Only when the task had been completed, was the true power released unto the creature.  Legend states that when all 10 tasks are complete, the gods shall descend upon the land once again, and turn the world into a perfect utopia. Unfortunately, the legend also speaks of a terrible evil surrounding the crystals. If a task is abandoned or the person killed, the evil of the crystal is released. The forces of darkness feed off the evils of the crystal, and with each abandonment, they grow more powerful. If all of the carriers fail, or the creatures were to die, Faron may once again exterminate the inhabitants of this world, and give rise to his own creations."  "Are you even paying attention to me, Kayd?"  "Huh? Oh yeh, sure thing grandpa. I got the gist of it. Gods kill each other, crystal shatters, dudes die and evil wins. Great story. Hey, i gotta go. I'll catcha later."

      A ray of light glistened through a hole in the curtains, which belonged to an open window of an old cottage in the outskirts of the town. Tiny flakes of snow along the window sparkled like diamonds in the light. Slowly, the beam of light crept up towards a wooden bed in the room, like a mischievous young lad planning to wake up his father with the crash of a saucepan. Along the intricate carvings on the legs and across the covers the light snuck, towards the face of a boy, fast asleep. The boy was dreaming of swash-buckling pirates with dazzling swords, and hidden treasures deep within the heart of a jungle somewhere far, far away.  Suddenly, the wind rose up, coming through the window. Accompanying the beam of light in it's sinister prank, the wind pulled the curtains apart, and the light burst through the window, jumping on the boys face with all it's might. The boy stirred, let out an exhausted yawn, and rolled out of the light, murmuring incoherently. The light, in failing to wake the boy, scurried behind the safety of the curtains and hid from the room.   The wind, however, was determined to wake the boy up. With an almighty gust of chilly winters wind, it filled the room. Snowflakes scattered all around, one landing on the boys cheek. Finally, the boy got up. Satisfied, the wind dissapeared without a trace, while the light still remained, determined now to fill the whole room as the wind did, and bring the day to one more person.  The boy threw the covers off himself, stumbled over countless dirty shirts and underwear towards the curtains, groaned, and closed the window, pulling the curtains completely shut. The day was ready for the boy, but the boy wasn't ready for the day, and he went back to bed.  "Get up, lazy ass!"  A door creaked open, and an old man hobbled in carrying a bucket of icy cold water.  "C'mon grandpa, it's too early, just gimme 5...10 more minutes..."  "I said... get up!"  The old man promptly poured the freezing cold water all over the boy, still in his covers, and put the half-full bucket down at the side of the bed.  "I want this all out and ready to be dried now, Kayd. Hahaha!!!"  Kayd 'decided' it was time to get up, and jumped out of his bed, soaking wet and cold. Chuckling to himself, Kayds grandpa started off towards the door, but was met by a barrage of soaked clothes and sheets, followed by the half filled bucket of water.

      *starts singing*  It's nine o'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Makin' love to his tonic and gin  He says, "Son, can you play me a melody? I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes"  La la la, de de da La la, de de da da dum  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feelin' alright  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke But there's someplace that he'd rather be He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me." As the smile ran away from his face "Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place"  Oh, la la la, de de da La la, de de da da da  Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy And probably will be for life  And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinkin' alone  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feelin' alright  It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile 'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see To forget about life for a while And the piano, it sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"  Oh, la la la, de de da La la, de de da da dum  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feelin' alright  _-Billy Joel-Piano Man-_  Drama exam done and forgotten. lol. I think i did ok, but i screwed up a few lines in Macbeth for sum reason. Oh well, it's all good.  Anyways, i'm off. -Gav

      *starts singing*  Walked away, heard them say "Poison hearts will never change, walk away again" Turned away in disgrace Felt the chill upon my face cooling from within  It's hard to notice gleaming from the sky When you're staring at the cracks It's hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered  You... walked away, heard them say "Poisoned hearts will never change, walk away again"  All the cracks they lead right to me And all the cracks will crawl right through me All the cracks, they lead right to me And all the cracks will crawl right through me, and I fell apart  As I... walked away, heard them say "Poisoned hearts will never change" Walked away again Turned away in disgrace Felt the chill upon my face cooling from within  _-A Fire Inside (AFI)-The leaving song-_  Well, what can i say? Today was pretty crappy. Apparently i'm failing Drama class, even thought i'm about to take my grade 7 exam for it at DMIA (Dance Masters International Assoc.) out of school tomorrow.  Funny how some people have no idea about others hey... Take my drama teacher for example,just coz i'm in a bad mood about it all. She knows nothing about me, yet she makes so many assumptions- "I know you can do this, you're just bein lazy" Well, maybe it's because i'm catching up on a term for 4 different TEE subjects at the moment, and since Drama isn't TEE, it's not as important right now? Did you ever think i have other classes? Sorry, but there are some things i can't keep up with, and a pointless drama class where marks aren't gonna account for anything is one of them. Now, i'm not saying she's evil or anything, coz really, she's pretty cool, it's just, i have other, more important things to do, than write about my feelings towards some crappy exercise we did in drama.  But yeh, today was just...odd.  "I'm not here, i'm still in bed." That was my motto today, aside from "No, I'm just tired, not stoned" and "Shut up". lol  Aaah...can't get my drama exam out of my head!!! Macbeth is evil, and implanted into my memory now for ever.  Anyways, i'm off.                  -Gav

(confident ey? lol) btw Pooley, if ur readin this, remember- breathe, THEN plie. lol  Acro... funny thing about that exam... *starts laughing* before i got in there, i was practicing my hoop trick with a small hoop out the back of the studio, thinking to myself "when you get in there, grab the big hoop, not the small one". So there i was, starting my first exercise, and guess what? I forgot my hoop altogether. lol so i'm just sittin there, laughing my ass off coz i forgot the damned thing, and when i finally get it, which one do i grab? The small one, of course. Luckily, i just managed to pull the whole thing off, so yeh, it went okay i guess. lol  And now, since my hand is totally screwed, i've taped my fingers together, so it looks like i've broken em. lol well, it's all good.

      What a great end to a day hey. lol I got my drama exam results back...and i got Honours plus!!! Just so ya know, that's like, the 'official' top mark. There is honours double plus, but that's if ya get the top mark, and ya just stand out even more. *mentions the fact that he got H++ last drama exam* lol.  *Starts singing*  Well there's a little boy waitin' at the counter of a corner shop He's been waitin' down there, waitin' half the day They never ever seem to have the time He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground He gets to his feet and he says; "What About me, it isn't fair I've had enough now I want my share Can't you see? I wanna live! But you just take more than you give..."  Well there's a pretty girl servin' at the counter of a corner shop She's been waitin' back there, waitin' for her dream And dreams walk in and out, they never stop Well she's not too proud to cry out loud She runs to the street and she screams; "What About me, it isn't fair I've had enough now I want my share Can't you see? I wanna live! But you just take more than you give..." (More than you give)  Take a step back and see the little people They maybe young'uns but they're the ones that make the big people big So listen, as they whisper; "What about me? ..."  Now we're standin' on the corner of a world gone home Nobody's been changed, nobody's been saved And I'm feelin' cold and alone I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot But sometimes I wish for more than I've got...  "What About me, it isn't fair I've had enough now I want my share Can't you see? I wanna live! But you just take more - What about me?! It isn't fair! I've had enough now I want my share! Can't you see? I wanna live! But you just take more, You just take more, You just take more than you give...  What about me? What about me? What about me?  _-Moving Pictures-What about me-_  Yeah, Moving Pictures, not Shannon Knoll or howeva u spell it. Now remember, always appreciate the originals, kids. lol  Umm...yeh, i just came back from dancing right now, so i think i'll work on another part to that story of mine. lol  Anyways, i'm off. -Gav
