       Epanastrophe   Three sisters govern the Fates.  In the language of the Danaans they are called  Klotho ,  Lachesis , and  Atropos .  Collectively they are called the Fates, the  Moirai , in the long-passing still lingering shadows of the Danaan's language, they were called the  Parcae  by the tribes of Umbria and Etrusca, and they are the Weavers of Destiny.  They are known to us, each by their functions, for they are spinners, forever entwinning the lives of mortals upon their distaff, and weaving the great tapestry of Time with the threads of mortal lives.                                                 Klotho is the eldest, and in their ancient script her name means to spin or  turn , her younger sister is called Lachesis, it is to her that is given the duty of cutting the lives of men from the spindle of Life, she is the one who assigns each, mortal and divine, their place in the cosmic balance.  For you see, these sisters weave the weave of Time for great Kronos, he who is the maker of his own time, they are the  tropoi , the turners.  The youngest is called Atropos, for she is steadfast and unturning, her eyes firmly fixed upon the firmament of the Stars, she cannot be swayed by the prayers and pleas of man or god.  Collectively the sisters are the sisters Time; they are the Past, Present, and the Future, and there power is absolute, even the brilliant Storm God must submit to his own very Destiny.  Every time you swear that something is weird you invoke them and the path of your fate is turned...    "...Echthron gar andran  moiron  eis anastrophon daimon didoÂ´si kouk eai phronein mega...",   which is to say, now, in our own language, so far from theirs and yet haunting us still,  daimon anastrophe ,  "And for the god turns-over the  fates  of his  enemies  and does not allow them to be great..."     backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

      They say the Sky sees everything.  In the Luvian language, spoken in that long distanced land of Anatolia, where today nations still fight in unjust wars, and they are still seeking to control the Sky, he is referred to as Tarhunt.  He is the conqueror.  In the land of the Danaans he wears a coat of feathers each emblazoned with an all seeing eye.  Then, and sometimes now, along some dank corridors, smelling of books and dead languages, he still reigns, he is the chief of the gods and provides protections.  And in these times, and sometimes now, as tonight, on the phone, for an hour and a half, he still holds some measure of sway in the celestial courts.  There are three measures of sacred ties for the Danaans, and it is over these that he presides.  The first is called  xenia , in their ancient language, which is ours as well, it is the notion of hospitality.  If asked for, hospitality can never be denied, it is both a social and divine imperative.  To deny  Xenos  is to be turned away, and so it is he, thunderous Deus, that looks over those who have been turned away.  He is their guardian, and it is to him that the priests and prophets call when mankind does not heed their desperate cries.  The second is know as  hiketes , that is to say suppliants.  Those who are new and arrive in the strangeness of the unknown.  The God of Storms watches over them too, because he is no stranger to the newness of Darkness.  It is to the prostrate that he wraps his arms in protection.  It is to us, those who have been left weak by circumstance, by chance, and perhaps by circumlocution, that we places one hand on their knee and one on chin in guardianship to those that beg --- because they have nothing left to give.  The last, certainly the third, he offers is the protection of Oaths, what they called the  horkios , and the justice brought upon those that break them.  Every week I write a mantra on the board that hangs above my desk.  It is a revival to the power of the Word, what the Egyptians call Heka, the magic power that dwells in the stomach and is released through the power of speech.  It is to the  Deus Pater  that I remind myself, daily, of my obligation to fulfill, and his to protect.  This week my Word is  Euorkon , which is to remain faithful to one's Oath.  The Oath is a bond, it fulfills that liminal function of tying together - it exists within the meso-cosmos and is the umbilicus, the middle and the center, the pin of time, between the world of the divine and the world of mankind.  To break the Oath is to sever yourself from the community, but its more dangerous aspect is to sever yourself from your self.    It is to the Suppliants that the Storm God, the Conqueror, gives his strength when they no longer possess their own.  To those who have been denied hospitality and those who have had their Oaths broken.  And it is upon those, whom have denied the gift of hospitality, those whom have broken the Oaths of others, that the lord of storms breaks the heavens open.  ...for like the suppliants whom he sees and looks upon, there are those whom would not allow the Cloud Gatherer to be turned away from...    backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

      There is the concept of a Story here.  It is not a Story in the standard sense, and perhaps even in the narratological sense.  The function of this story is to do and be exactly as it is presented, a circumlocution -  a speaking around .  It is exactly what it is not and isn't exactly what it is.  Its intention is to speak around by directly speaking of.  None of the Characters are Real, neither are they Imaginary.  The sitiuations are fake only in so far as they actually happened.  This Story is a  turning away , it is a sacrifice for protection.  Perhaps by the end the path will be discovered...   urlLink "Nothing is true, everything is permitted."     backBlog('110503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        The adult,  and even the more advanced child, demands something new in his activities, in his games. But this 'sliding-away' ( glissement ) conceals what is the true secret of the ludic, namely, the most radical diversity constituted by repitition in itself.  It can be seen in the child, in his first movement, at the moment when he is formed as a human being, manifesting himself as an insistence that the story should always be the same, that its recounted realization should be ritualized, that is to say textually the same.   This requirement of a distinct consistency in the details of its telling signifies that the realization of the signifier will never be able to be careful enough in its memorization to succeed in designating the primacy of the significance as such.   -Jacques Lacan, Seminar XI: "The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis"    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        And in this last case, notably, one would conclude implicitly that this being,  for example a being present to itself, as consciousness, eventually would come to defer or to differ: whether by delaying and turning away from the fulfillment of a "need" or a "desire," or by differing from itself.  But in neither of these cases would such a present being be "constituted" by this  différance ."  -Jacques Derrida,  Différance , 1968.

      The  apotropaic  device is a religious and literary device that is used to protect the narrator from harm.  The manner is often  self-depricatory  and involves the  sacrifice of value and meaning  for protection.  The  apotropaic  action is intrinsically  antinomian  -  it is against the law  - because it is both dangerous to the community and to the individual.

       "Ailinon ailinon eipe, to d' eu nikato..."  Oh please! Oh please! say: But that all will be well...                -Aeschylus,  Agamemnon   In the legal tradition of the Jews, as set forth in the  Mishnah , there is a term:  Apotropos .  The term is used to designate a guardian for an orphan, for someone whose family has all died, or perhaps abandoned the child.  In Aeschylus' tragedy,  Agamemnon , the Luvian priestess, Cassandra - the seer and prophetess - cries out:           "Apollo!  Apollo! Guardian of the Ways, my ruin.  Ah, what Way is this that you have brought me! To what a house!"   It is difficult now, after months of absence, to not feel as if abandoned.  That is to say that within the every day I feel a distance, placed there perhaps with a sense of purpose, certainly within a sense of deed.  There are often times when we must travel off on our own, upon the winding Ways, alone.  And yet with Family there is always the sense of a return,  nostos , a coming back, a turning away from an improper Path.  ...and yet, after almost three months, and nearly seven, and nearly 32 before that there is a sense of loss.  A cosmic injust of having been screwed over not just once, twice, three times, but possibly four.    ...Its hard to know where you went wrong when no one talks to you.  Its hard to say, "I'm sorry" when you don't know what you've done...    backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

        What does it mean for Time to be off?  For something to be out-of-joint with Time?  Or when people say: the timing wasn't right?  We seem to have two very distinct notions of time.  On the one hand we speak of meeting at such and such a time, or 'that was two years ago - I'm very different now', or 'we loved for a lifetime'.  Each of these statements seems to offer us three different conceptions of what it means to experience time and to be experienced within Time.    We notice  urlLink clock-time  constantly; it is all around us, down in the corners of our computers, on the dashboard of the car, or the quick glance at the face of our watch as we look down while we are walking.  We are permeated by it, we wake up to it, fall asleep by it, time our love-making by it ...and yet somehow we seem to have no sense of it.  It binds us in no way and it corresponds to the reality of our perceptions in only a loose and framing way.   Yet somehow we use it as a form of universal standard of measure of the experience of our own existence.  When asked about the performance of a silly insipid act..."Oh, he was only twelve," "I couldn't possibly have understood, I was only 19."   Yet these statements themselves seem even more removed from the painful joy of the interpretation of our own lives' constitution.  That somehow I am relieved of the burden of my failings to myself and others because of my clock-age.  A universal standard, not without a face, upon which I can disburden the responsibility of my own liberty upon.    "Of course I was happy ...I was six."    We seem to excuse ourselves to others for our failures in our own self knowledge, and give Time a bad rap.    I can still remember lying on the mattress on the floor; the sun was beaming through the slits in the shade and warming the wood.  Her hair was just out of the reach of my mouth but a few strands had drifted their way across my lips and I could smell every aspect of her in each shallow still sleep breath.  Our feet were entwined and I could feel the bottoms of her feet, rough and worn, silkily rubbing upon the arches of my feet, unconscious as she slept with my arms wrapped around her.    Despite her absence to me now, for as much as I know she is dead, certainly that her that I knew is, this memory is still forever occurring - forever in its own time, alongside the memory of every other  future  and  past  lover.

This is, in fact, itself, an allusion (thank you Jackie), it is irony of the most bitter and sweet time, in the never ending referencing from one place to an other.  Along the winding river of history I do not wish to stand on the shoulders of giant's, I only I ask to have a voice that is heard alongside them...

It was the schwank office of a former dot.com, located downtown, in the 11th floor of the Omni Hotel. I imagined that several years ago there had been a fooseball table in the conference room. I sat in the hipster multi-colored chair, leggs crossed, asserting my confidence. This interview could have meant a new life for me. ...free from debt, free from the dying of my life here, free from the failures of my past. I picked up the Wall Street Journal.

         Eulogy    I just found out that my brother is in a coma. He went into one several days ago, and he doesn't want to come back. He's led a life full of misery, sorrow, struggle, and....faith. His life, from its beginning had the portents of pain, suffering, and loss. He has had all of these. And he always believed in himself. In the end he will die alone, having spent the last few years of his life trying to reach out to people and make up for the unjustices of his past... I never really knew him, even though I talked with him more than anyone else in my family - and like everyone else - I shrugged him off, when he reached out I reached back, but I never took the time or space to reach out on my own to him. I've known for about a year that he would die soon, and even still,  I wasn't big enough to reach past my own, very human, limits. I want to tell him before he dies that I was always there for him,  because my heart is, I want to tell him before he dies that I have failed him,  because I didn't take as much time to be there as I should have. I want to tell him how proud I am of him, because in the end, he tried...and he may not know it, but he got want he needed. I just wish I hadn't left him - alone. I have avoided him for the past seven months.   Fifteen minutes is enough time to give to someone who loves you.  There is a silent place - in a dark unspoken and unexplored part of my heart - a turning place- an apotropaic place -  that believes I will die like him. It sees the patterns that some of the people I love follow and it whispers to me that they will never join me again.  So for them, I sing my good-byes now.  And for my brother, so that he knows I am there, I sing with him. I love you John, for always following your heart.  Your self has returned to you.

        There was once a beautiful young honest red-fox who had had her heart broken by a sly silver-tongued tom cat.  The sassy tom had found another fox, not red in hue, and not nearly as beautiful, but more wily and deceptive, and who would make the tom chase his tail for her.    One day the red-fox was strolling down the path where she came upon an older, but not so old, friendly and sly ferret.  She recognized the ferret because she had seen him in the tom cat's den, and knew him to be honest and wise.  She had always thought to herself that she would want to befriend the ferret but would never get the chance, now that the tom had kicked her to the curb.  With agitation her fluffy red tail begin to swish and she moved her feet excitedly as she spoke of the beautiful day with the wise and honest ferret.  The ferret, being wise and honest, recognized her agitation and told her not to fret, that soon enough the tom would leave the other deceitful fox and that then, if things were right, she could return to the tom she so loved.  The young and honest red-fox recognized the truth in the things the older wise ferret said and with a smiling nod she made her way.  Sometime later the sassy silver-tongued tom-cat did indeed loose the wily and deceptive fox, after much heartache and tribulation.  Soon upon he met once again the beautiful and honest red-fox and they set about their courtship once more, with her eventually moving into the same den that the tom-cat and the wise and honest ferret shared.    It was an exciting time for them all and they had many long talks and many long walks and shared deeply their feelings with each other.  Included with them were several others, but the two closest were a quiet and talented ducky and a fuzzy pure-hearted young bunny.  They each became fast friends and spent their time in frivolity, wonder, merriment, and love.  Each was best friends with each and they all made a promise to each other to stay forever together and to push each other toward their respective dreams.    They were not alone in their dreams either.  For the gods so loved and delighted in the love and joy of these creatures that they often came down to visit them in their den.  Now the red-fox was especially talented and was very intuitive indeed.  She knew when the gods were near and could always make tell of the passings of spirits and such things.  Knowing that the ferret was a keeper of arcane secrets she spoke to him many times and they shared in each others wisdoms, teaching each other much.  At first these things brought great fear to the red-fox but with the help of her wise and honest friend the ferret and through much bravery and courage she learned to speak to the gods and the spirits of the dead.  Years later the talented ducky, now transformed and no longer a ducky, and the pure-hearted bunny, would also follow the same path and ask the advise of the ferret and learn the ways of the arcane, each in their own method and manner.  But in those early days it was still the red-fox and the ferret who would watch the signs and tell the dens occupants of the happenings of the gods.  And they saw great things for the denizens of the den and a rough time ahead.  But they were still happy then and knew of the possibility of greatness to come.    Then one day the pure-hearted bunny introduced the ferret to a young and beautiful smart and sensitive minx.  The ferret, as wise and honest as he was, fell in love instantly.  The smart and sensitive minx was a quiet one, often spending her time alone and in her own mind.  She had gone through some difficult times and had lost herself in her explorations, and although she didn't know it at first, felt as if the ferret could bring her out of the dark places she had been.  And so it went and the ferret and the minx began their courtship, and it was beautiful to behold.  To each they were the others compliment and it often seemed as if they had known and been together for lives far longer than simply this one.  They shared dreams, and words, and knowledge, tender silence, and a deep deep love of and for each other.  But one day the ferret was forced to leave to pay back an old debt, one that he was forced to serve.  The parting was difficult, but the ferret and the minx knew their link could not be broken, and so with a longing so intense they cried in pain, they left one another, waiting for the day that each would return to the other, and they could be united again.  The ferret's time away was a dark one.  He had been enslaved to pay off a debt and his times were difficult ones.  He gnawed and thrashed at his bonds and eventually in a frenzy he was able to break free.  He had been helped, though, through the aid of his friends back in his old den, as well as his love, the minx, who had all sent blessings to the gods for the ferret's speedy return and freedom from his servitude.  The talented ducky, now beginning his metamorphosis, had pleaded strongly with the gods and asked that his friend be freed.  But things were no longer the same...for anyone.  The minx had moved away when the ferret did, in the hopes of traveling across the seas and finding herself while she and the ferret were away.  The red-fox and the tom-cat had grown tired of their den and set about to find a new one, a place where they could thrive together.  They were very in love, you see, and they sought to start out the joy and happiness of their lives together for the first time.  The pure-hearted bunny had found a place, with many others like him (only not as pure), where they would teach him to listen and speak with his heart, so he and the talented ducky had moved out to a place in the remote high mountains.  Each had hoped that by moving they would carry the seeds of the tree that had been planted in them within the tom-cat and ferret's old den and that they would spread the teachings of the gods and themselves.  The minx and ferret, so deeply in love, met once again.  But his days in darkness had made the ferret wary, and in place of finding clarity in her explorations, the minx had become lost and was filled with confusion.  The gods had seen to it that once again their lives would follow the same paths.  Her time away from the ferret had filled her with doubt and fear and she could no longer tell her true self from her true love.  In confusion and doubt and anger she bit ferociously and severely at him, wounding him deeply and sending him further into his darkness.  The once honest and wise ferret snapped and clawed at her in turn, making her confusion worse and she became more and more lost.  The talented ducky and pure-hearted bunny, once the best of friends and so close, entered into a bitter quarrel.  The talented ducky, often given to foolish fancy, had quacked and roosted wrongly where he ought not to have.  At this the pure-hearted bunny's heart glazed over with anger and he swore harsh and false words against the ducky, and in silence their once close friendship came to an end.  The red-fox and the tom-cat, so intent on beginning a new and joyous life together, found that there new den was no better than their old one.  They faced solitude and loneliness in a strange land that was not hospitable to them.  The red-fox became agitated in their small den and longed for freedom and a new home.  But the tom-cat, formerly sly and shifty (but still with a silver-tongue), was now determined that they should try and continue upon their dreams, was unable to leave.    But the red-fox became more and more agitated, unleashing her frustration and fury upon her partner the tom-cat.   He in turn hissed at her and soon fell back to his sly ways.    So he made a sacrifice that his love should leave him so that she could be happy and that they not be miserable together and find her way to a shinier place where he could one day follow and be happy too.  They were filled with confusion and doubt and pain as they parted, but still with hope and love that they should carry out their dreams.  And then, suddenly, the young tom-cat with the silver-tongue died and it seemed that all of their hopes died with him.  The once star-bound lovers, the wise and honest ferret and smart and sensitive minx, who had been so deeply in love, speak no longer to each other.     The honest red-fox, in her mourning, turned away, without word, from the wise and honest ferret, and now they seem as if, to others, to no longer be friends.  The ferret and the now transformed ducky remain close friends, but the wise and honest ferret is not welcome within his friend's home, for the once-ducky lives with the red-fox and minx, you see.  The pure-hearted bunny still speaks with them all, separately of course, and even occasionally to his once close friend, the talented ducky.  But the pure-hearted bunny is distant from them, away in the mountains, and has made a new nest of friends and is unable to always come see his old friends.  These creatures, once blessed by the gods, have left them and the love that remains between them all lies buried, as if to almost be gone.   The gods had told the wise and honest ferret and the honest and intuitive red-fox that the times ahead would be rough ...and indeed they are.     backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

         Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls: Part. II    I can't possibly explain what the sensation felt like sitting there.  I could feel the build up running up my spine, like my entire routine was in a kind of slow motion capture reverse.  An image of me playing forward getting back into bed, I could feel the sensation of my spine popping and aligning back in place, the frames continue...in bed the sheets are moving back over me, I am laying back against my pillow, and everything is still moving forward.  Freeze frame. i'm sitting there, legs crossed, knees against the hard wooden gymnasium floor. [break] the image of the word flashes over and over again in my mind. stroboscopic.  HOPE. I'm still sitting there. HOPE. We are all mesmerized.  We watch the police as they come down upon the innocent.    It is an apocolyptic society of discipline and punish. HOPE. A middle-aged black woman hits her child. HOPE. I'm still sitting there. I feel the tympani at some point, I can't even begin to comprehend when. Forward, backward motion.  Freeze frame.  HOPE. Its the only thing I have left to hold on to. I shouldn't even be here. HOPE. I shouldn't be here without her. HOPE. I'm still sitting here. The tympani is getting softer (for tympani). HOPE. At some point the boundaries of time begin to collapse.  I am now understanding that all time is sequential yet built upon an infinte cyclical loop.  Every strand within the river of time is expressed within the existrence of a single persons life.  We have exactly one life.  I understand that history as the unfolding of time has merely been the overlapping layers of these patterns, weaves, threads, into a giant tapestry that not only are we in but goddammit we  are  the tapestry. I see the layers building on top of themselves and I fully understand how it took the existence of every microfiber to create the space around me. I'm still sitting here. HOPE. The intensity is picking up.  I can't even see guitars anymore. HOPE.  TIME.  POLICE.  LOVE.  HATE.  DEATH.  ....HOPE, again. REBITH?

        If you have been rejected many times in your life, then one more  rejection isn't going to make much difference. If you're  rejected, don't automatically assume it's your fault. The other  person may have several reasons for not doing what you are asking her to do: one of it may have anything to do with you. Perhaps  the person is busy or not feeling well or genuinely not  interested in spending time with you. Rejections ar part of  everyday life. Don't let them bother you. Keep reaching out to  others. Keep reaching out to others. When you begin to receive  positive responses, then you are on the right track. It's all a  matter of numbers. Count the positive responses and forget about  the rejections.     the most essential thing in life is to establish a  heartfelt communication with others.     backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

        I felt close to him for the first time in months again.  He was sitting on a large boulder outcropping, not far from his old house, in what we still call Allston Street park.   I am writting a paper on the concept of friendship and justice.   There is still a lot of pain associated with me for Boston.  Pain that wasn't even mine.  Things that happened, people who were absent, and people who were present where I wasn't, in the two years after I left.   Boston had once been the most beautiful time in my life...but right now it is the closure of an old wound that still can't heal.  A closure that's 1,800 miles and eight blocks away.   I said everythings changed but its still the same. He agreed.    backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

        "Thanks for a really nice night," she paused, "you're a really smart boy."  And the horror of my dismissal hit home.  Because suddenly I couldn't be seen as anything other than the things that I knew, or the ways that I could say things, or the long pretty words that I could string together.  And she would never know that I value silence so far above common speech. And she would never see that for me its not about the things that you know but the life that you live.  And she would never know that the whole time I could only distantly think of a girl who at one time saw me as an equal.  Who loved me for who I was, and realized that I said so much more when I wasn't speaking. And I realized how much she needed to leave me...and that really it had nothing to do with me, its what she needed for her self.  But that doesn't distance me from the fact that I still miss her for who she is. It doesn't change the fact that I still love her, and always will.    backBlog('NUMBER','NAME')   urlLink Feedback

         Visions Of Johanna    Bob Dylan    Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet? We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it Lights flicker from the opposite loft In this room the heat pipes just cough The country music station plays soft But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off Just Louise and her lover so entwined And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane Louise, she's all right, she's just near She's delicate and seems like the mirror But she just makes it all too concise and too clear That Johanna's not here The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place  Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously And when bringing her name up He speaks of a farewell kiss to me He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall How can I explain? Oh, it's so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn  Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze When the jelly-faced women all sneeze Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze I can't find my knees" Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel  The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him Sayin', "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him" But like Louise always says "Ya can't look at much, can ya man?" As she, herself, prepares for him And Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain

        It’s sometime – probably September or October.  You had called me from Paris.  You thought you had found a band that I would like.  I remember not really paying attention.  I had never heard of them, but you told me they were really beautiful.  You said I would really like them.  You were right…2 years later, I do.  And now I think about the spider web I am stuck in.  I think of all the stupid things I said.  God, if I could just go back and un-say them.  All the hateful emotionally charged accusations.  All the guilt, all the pushing, all the doubt, all the anger.    …and its lived in me for so long now that I’ve almost forgotten what its like to live without it.  That caked dried black ball of hate and anger dwelling in the place just above my heart and below my ribcage.  I lay on my bed last night, meditating, finally trying to pull it out, working my fingers through it, those thick oily black layers of ooze that have been my anger and hate for the past three years.  Slowly it starts to come out, dissipating into the air, swept away by stellar currents and cosmic starlight.  Mercury begins to cover and coat my hands, protecting me from the infection of my own hatred.  In its place a dark ultraviolet light, like starshine, begins to occupy.  For the first time in a while I start to feel clean – healthy.  The nausea in my stomach – which had been there for so long, named for the guy you cheated on me with, pulled out and stored in a tiny hematite container – small and too large for its size.  Released, clumpy globs floating into the atmosphere.  It’s almost gone now.  And listening to  this  song, playing on the radio two years ago in Paris, I feel like writing you a letter…explaining, clearing, and cleaning the air between us now.   Averting my self.   Flowing the pain out of me, apologizing, atoning for my sins, never thinking I would raise my voice in anger to the woman I had promised to always love…  But it seems like you are seeing someone else now, so maybe a letter would be inappropriate, and really the timing is off.  I’m still here after all and all of this has been said before.  You’ve heard it all before anyway.  There’s no letter in the mail yet.  Soon.  Packed up, on a plane…and the letter is on its way, cleaning myself of you, and this place, and me, and all the pain we both share.  Soon…but not yet.   But still, I’m on my way out of here…

         Coldplay  –  “Trouble”    Oh no, I see.   A spider web is tangled up with me,  and I lost my head, and thought of all the stupid things I’d said.  	  Oh no, what’s this?   A spider web and I’m caught in the middle.   So I turn to run, and thought of all the stupid things I’d done.  And I never meant to cause you trouble, And I never meant to do you wrong, Ah, well, if I ever caused you trouble,  Oh, no, I never meant to do you harm.  Oh no, I see.   A spider web and it’s me in the middle.   So I twist and turn. Here and there, and I’m all in a bubble.  Singin’ it… And I never meant to cause you trouble And I never meant to do you wrong. Ah, well if I ever caused you trouble, Oh, no, I never meant to do you harm.  They spun a web for me,  They spun a web for me, They spun a web for me,

       For Che   I've been out walking I don't do too much talking These days, these days. These days I seem to think a lot About the things that I forgot to do And all the times I had the chance to.  I've stopped my rambling, I don't do too much gambling These days, these days. These days I seem to think about How all the changes came about my ways And I wonder if I'll see another highway.  I had a lover, I don't think I'll risk another These days, these days. And if I seem to be afraid To live the life that I have made in song It's just that I've been losing so long. La la la la la, la la.  I've stopped my dreaming, I won't do too much scheming These days, these days. These days I sit on corner stones And count the time in quarter tones to ten. Please don't confront me with my failures, I had not forgotten them.

       Contra Stupidos    In a room a thousand years wide sleep the unawakened. They toss and turn in their dream states, restless and grasping. They clutch out and from their self-created dreamlands,  they claw and grasp, claw and grasp. They reach for meaning, like infants sucking for air. Finally a hand brushes past theirs and for a momment they touch at divine madness. For a momment they are wrested from their eternal slumber and feel the cry for wakefullness  from within and beyond. ...but in their sleep they slap and claw these hands away  and prefer to remain asleep.  I grow tired of these sleepers and wish to walk among them no longer. I am tired of feeling the scabs of their unawareness, Leave me alone and dont demean me by claiming to be like me any more. Wake your self up, dont waste my time with your pretentious chatter. I am tired of the stupid.   Think for your self.

        Newly I have found myself between Language.  This time I was not between Words, but, rather, Language.  I have found myself by means of the magic of Language.  The magic of language dwells within experience, that is to say, within the meaning that moves across language.  To speak is to give a gift, it is an imperfect gift.  A gift that gives responsibility and owes obligation.  To speak is to enter into a contract between myself, between myself and the world, between myself and others.  Just so, the world agrees, others agree in listening, to enter into this contract with-alongside me.  Language dies, that is, the self is marginalized and neglected, when the gift does not return to me.

        "Die Zauberkraft eines Lachens mit jenen Augen voller Verlangen, einem zum Kuessen geschaffen Mund, mit jenen bl&#252henden Wangen"   -von Italo Calvino   Neulich habe ich mich zwischen Sprache gefunden. Durch die Zauberkraft der Sprache habe ich mich zu mich selbst gefunden.  Die Magie der Sprache bleibt innerhalb des Erleibnisses, das hei&#223t, innerhalb der Bedeutung, die sich &#252ber Sprache bewegt.  Zu sprechen ist, ein Geschenk, es zu geben ist ein unvollst&#228ndiges Geschenk.  Ein Geschenk, das Verantwortlichkeit gibt und Verpflichtung verdankt.  Zu sprechen ist an einem Vertrag zwischen mich, zwischen mich tielznehmen und die Welt, zwischen mich und Andere.  Gerade so, stimmt die Welt, Andere stimmen beim H&#246ren zu, zum Teilnehmen an diesem Vertrag mit-l&#228ngsseits mir.  Sprache stirbt, das Selbst wird begrenzt und vernachl&#246ssigt, wenn dieses Geschenk nicht zu mir zur&#252ckkommt.

          Hávamál      137.  I trow I hung on that windy Tree nine whole days and nights, stabbed with a spear, offered to Odin, myself to mine own self given, high on that Tree of which none hath heard from what roots it rises to heaven.    138.  None refreshed me ever with food or drink, I peered right down in the deep; crying aloud I lifted the Runes then back I fell from thence.    139.  Nine mighty songs I learned from the great son of Bale-thorn, Bestla's sire; I drank a measure of the wondrous Mead, with the Soulstirrer's drops I was showered.    140.  Ere long I bare fruit, and throve full well, I grew and waxed in wisdom; word following word, I found me words, deed following deed, I wrought deeds.    141.  Hidden Runes shalt thou seek and interpreted signs, many symbols of might and power, by the great Singer painted, by the high Powers fashioned, graved by the Utterer of gods.    142.  For gods graved Odhin, for elves graved Daïn, Dvalin the Dallier for dwarfs, All-wise for Jötuns, and I, of myself, graved some for the sons of men.    143.  Dost know how to write, dost know how to read, dost know how to paint, dost know how to prove, dost know how to ask, dost know how to offer, dost know how to send, dost know how to spend?    144.  Better ask for too little than offer too much, like the gift should be the boon; better not to send than to overspend. ........ Thus Odin graved ere the world began; Then he rose from the deep, and came again.

         Re-membering Boulder    The biggest mistake I've ever made was loving someone enough to trust them. Loosing that trust and trying to still love them almost killed me... Hopefully learning to trust myself again doesnt.

      Unusual   No I am not a graduate student here, and never will be. Yes, I've been rejected twice. My German is fair for a beginner, my French is horrible for someone who has studied it for six years, I've forgotten what little Greek I knew, I have forgotten even more Latin, and even though Spanish is my first language I've forgotten most of it. I don't know what 'pretentious' means, but its probably me. I moved here to study with someone who I knew almost nothing about. I moved here because of a girl who broke up with me. Most of the time I don't know what I'm talking about,  and chances are I know much less than people think I think I know, I am poorer and more in debt than I let on, Half of the people I have considered close friends are either dead or have left me, If you see a poster up in the Department saying "Have you seen this imposter..." Yes, its me.   apostrepsasin

         Amoris Catharine, Magis Amare Ips-issimus.     You asked for space, you needed a space to come into your own being,  you broke, you tore, you clawed and you held me away... We always knew it would come to this, we had said it from the beginning. I do not fault you for doing it, I do not blame you for your  why ,  it was only your  how , and now I am calling out to myself, I am calling for my own attonement,  I am summoned before my Self in my Guilt. I pushed you, I presurred you,  I demanded you  when  and how  long , I criticized and confused you. I was wrong, I should have just let you go.  And so now I only want for you to find your Self, Become who you are, Be yourself. I do not blame you, its what I've always wanted for you, But I hold you accountable, just as I hold myself.   I'm finally letting you go.  Find Your Self.      Ankunft des Gewesenen!

        I'm not knocking your want to carry that home Took it with you when you moved and got it broke  Found the pieces, we counted them all alone  Didn't add up, forgot to carry a zero  I can't be your apologist very long  I'm surprised that you'd want to carry that on  Count your blemishes you can't they're all gone  I can't see your response putting them back on  Like they're waiting for your guard to fall  So they can see it all  And you're so occupied with what other people are occupied with  And vice versa  And you've become what you thought was dumb  A fraction of the sum, the middle and the front  And now it's coming back hasn't come too far  I was trying to help but I guess I pushed too hard  And now we can't even touch it  Afraid it'll fall apart    Carry the Zero!  -BTS

        And so it is that I, I in whom history flows like a river, who lives within Plato's shadow, that is both his  ba , that is his animate force, or perhaps it might be better to speak of his projection, that is, his intentionality, but perhaps also his umbra, that is the long shadows cast by his   academe .  That long casting shadow, lit on a cave wall, from behind a stone curtain, cast by light - of what?  The candel of reason?  But more so perhaps a memmory, a re-membering, that is a re-animating.   And so I begin to write again, like those heroes of Sardina before me, that is - like the Aquarian Bill Burroughs - having for foresworn long ago the act of inscription, the demarkation, for my own very lack of voice, soto  voce , and perhaps the irony of my demarkations comes in this: that I presently live in the past in order to remember, that is to say, not-forget.  And yet the irony of this demarkation, my demarkation, is that in so writting I am inscribing, so as not to forget, but to re-member, to conjoin within a voice that is not my own, but rather, like in a mediumesque trance, like that of of Florence Farr, herself trapped within the magically nostalgic writings Yates; I channel these other voices, these ghosts [ psuchas ] that are not my own, in this I am thinking mostly of Burroughs, but perhaps even above all these thoughts, that is, in the act of  thinking , I am thinking of my friend Seth, whose ghost is perhaps closest to me, most near, and in whose presence I feel, still, both alone and at home.  But in my not-forgetting I must be also thinking of Platon, broad of shoulders, carrying [ phoreo ] the weight of my memmory, and also, of course, of Derrida, whose voice, even now, in text, perhaps in soul, but certainly not in body, I must also be summoning, calling forth, howling [ goetis ] for.  That is, a howling of my own soul, my own  psuche , so that in some way I may recover, that is re-member, my own very self.    And so it is again, perhaps irony, that I must use the voice, voce, vox, of an other, within which to summon my own self.  It is in someway, then, that I must say, that I am in love  with  Jacques Derrida, although for me, that is, not Jackie; that is to say, perhaps in being in love  with  Jacques Derrida, that I am, in some way, in love  alongside  Jacques Derrida, which is to say nothing of the projection of our love, that is - not our love of each other, that is me, but rather, instead, of the Other.  Thus my being in love with,   alongside , Jacques Derrida, not simply Jackie, is to say that we project, or perhaps in our projection we both occupy, with and alongside each other a love for the Other; that is, in our occupation, the space in which we dwell, and thus, our own very Selves.  But I must ask, that is, rather, instead, there is a question, a quest-ion, that we, that is 'I', and perhaps he as well, that is being inquired.  This question has itself no voice, and thus it is not truly asked.  Instead it functions as a true question, not a projection, but instead, rather a space, a dwelling, it is, if you will, what Heidegger, in his Bavarian metaphorical way calls a 'clearing'.  That is, a space,  ereignis , in a forest, from which one finds oneself standing in a clearing.   Aletheia .  That is, a-letheia.  That is, a not-forgetting.  And thus we are brought back again to rivers, to heroes, to ghosts.  That is the heroes who have awoken, deep underground, in Sardinia, arrayed on the banks of the river Lethe, forgetfulness.    These heroes, who are ghosts, which is to say  psuchas , which is to say, souls.   Oh heroes, you are not-forgotten, for I am inscribing your words upon the parchment of my heart...   kai oikeo megalokakothumois dareiois

        I sometimes wonder if I wouldnt have been better off to just have never come here.  We make some promises and fulfill them,  but they are mistakes we make down the line from which we never recover.  So far all I have done has been an enormous loss of time and money pushing me even further back, and I've lost so much more in 17 months than I have gained.  It would have been better never having come...

        "Holiday"  what became of everyone i used to know? where did our respectable convictions go? your words dont' match the story that your actions show, but what do i know? i'm sure you can't help but remembering I thought that you'd be one not to forget, but remembering's not helping you yet. say goodnight means goodbye. i know you thought my life would stop with you away maybe I can see you on the holidays, but you're worlds away I've never forgotten all our yesterdays but i'm lucky if we're speaking on the holidays the evidence presents itself accusingly, your absence speaking everything you think of me now that I am faced with opportunity you're not remembering I'm not asking you anyway Even if you ever could cave in I wouldn't know where to begin

        and built our own confused belief systems, which were endlessly and crucially beautiful in their small stubborn tangles of loss, worry, faith, and need? And made small gestures with our hands or eyes that were endlessly redeeming, and made us all sometimes almost believe in saints and/or angels? And daydreamed endlessly about living a little more quietly or a little bit louder for awhile? And almost always strived for a little more engagement with this falling/fallen world? Or hardened our resolve sometimes and bent our heads and backs into the task at hand and dug and built or erected? Or transmitted occasional epiphanies or urgent fears with photocopiers, silkscreens and CDR's? And found answers sometimes in the empty places, like gangs of birds flying out of dead buildings, beneath the sun's blind white hole? Like trees growing thru fences or an abandoned jar filled with a summer's worth of rusty water out there behind the place where the heavy trains roll? And found hope in the idea of the futile gesture? And manifested sometimes with bricks in our hands? And built something here in spite of and will not let them take it from us so easily? So please O please, let's please figure out soon what exactly we can build here on this parched and fallow ground. (Knowing all along, that sooner or later their bulldozers will come and tear it all down...)(But we can build it in spite of, and leave dusty notes about our journey's behind...

        and we learned the rules way to well, and they altered the way we felt and lived and breathed even? And what about the story of us all abandoning each other, because we were too self-involved to figure out how alone we all really felt mostly nearly all the time? (meaning that we all treated each other reallyreallyreally badly, man)? (and crafted our own neurotic soap operas with our boring sad couplings and irony, television and cocktails?) ANd in our infinite weakness we figured everything was shit anyways so might as well get used to the smell? and we gathered in compromised halls that reeked of failure, distance and self-alienation? And so we never really met? And since we never met, we never schemed or planned or manifested the ruined dreams that didn't have to be ruined at all? And never figured out how to counter all the bland agents of recuperation, who stole our brightest hopes always, and shot 'em out of satellites at a buck-fifty-nine an hour? (And would you believe us if we told you that we built a machine that'll bring all their fucking satellites the fuck down?) And the arguments for&against were never complicated but were certainly fucking complex? And we created slack fact-ions, and made believe that we were seditionaries, but were too easily moved or else did not ever move at all?  And never stormed the gates or walls? But crafted clumsy things with out hands, and those things were imortant to us, those clumsy abstracted towers and minurets we crafted with our own worried hands?

         a Jacques Derrida    You are retracing your steps.  The last vestiges lead you deeper into the park; you are advancing backward, toward it natively. ‘the triangle with its point downward, the lower part of Solomon’s seal, is the traditional symbol of the feminine principle, exploited extensively in Finnegans Wake.  It goes without saying that the valie of the letter V is more justly derived from a vague, vast group of assiciations.  The classic Mallarmean example is found in “Herodiade”…  All oppositions are based on the distinction between the original and the derived, the simple and the repeated, the first and the second, etc., lose their pertinence from the moment everything ‘begins’ by following a vestige. I.e. a certain repetition or text.  Better than ever you will have understood this in reading Numbers.    Everything there goes on…

        Sleeping today...in the rough haunted bayous of New Orleans.  Ghosts, living and absent, silently stalk the conversations, within and without the whispy dreamlands of sleep.  Wandering the corridors of someone else's mind, looking for armor, protection for, maybe from, myself, and a dear friend lends me her's (thanks Lindsay).   Still, he feels closest here, in his home, with his things, even still, I can feel him wandering off from here, always journeying, he is the true explorer, the Fool.  Within him is still found the Universe...and there are times, like now, both asleep and awake, when I wander with him still...

         urlLink the Baron  starts 'riding' me even before the Invocation.  Three days earlier we meet at a cross-roads, setting up the deal, I offer eggshells in return for spirit-sight, spirit-speech, and the ability to recognize and easily cross the thinner spots of the veil…and some other things.  I make the deal…I give him broken dreams, broken hopes, broken promises, broken thoughts, desires, wishes, plans…all the things we think about, all the little paranoias, and imagine on a daily basis and never commit to… broken eggshells .   urlLink The Qlippoth .  I do this so he can keep the restless spirits who serve him fettered and use this power to destroy those who break their oaths.  The Baron protects little children, and though he is a Bastard, he protects those who have been harmed wrongfully by the misdeeds of others...   Sex & Death    Stephen tells me I still act like an enlightened-asshole sometimes…it creeps up…we are enjoying a cold one in a cold place.  I am crawling through thin membranous passages, fleshy veined pulsations caked in shit, the Inverses' own lower-intestinal track.  Up ahead there is light…an 'out' of the tunnel; two, and three, and four years of shit, stinking, rotting within and around me… Up ahead there is blue, there is the smell of water, there is the feeling of Binah.    Lust.   I become the embodiment.  All channeled into only a few places, spaces for art, spaces for a really good book, spaces for creativity, all my magical debt-obligation… requition of love, a debt paid back to me,  return to sender , a case of hemorrhoids for the fucker that stole my bowl.  A wanting desire for the spinal fluid of the Universe to drip up through my nervous system, inject itself through my reptilian brain and straight saturation of my hippocampus and mid-brain function centers pumped across the fleshy surfaces of my cerebrum.   Sex & Death.   He mentions homeostasis.  Repeatedly.  I sometimes wonder if he is insulting me, like everyone else.   Eggshells.   I wonder where we are, knowing we are right here, where is the I/You?  The disjuncted static crackle of We/They that proscribes all of the stupid posturings and politics, the etiquettes, and the horrors of that House of Poison…Apoteka...poised just down the street from me.  I think of what the word means, what it truly means, the Cure & the Death of the Ill...thank you Eckhard, you are here with me too...  Papa Legba, deliver to me Papa Guedhe, call forth for me the Baron Samedi.   My chakras align, I feel my third eye opening and feel the violet flame above my head,  Keter , the fire at the base of the Pillar is a flame and I am decidely  here .  The pentagrams are cast, flaming about me, I stand in the center, I rap on the table, a battery of three times three raps, I summon  urlLink Mahakala :   I am become Time, great destroyer of Worlds, come to annihilate the universe.  Om Shri Shiva! Shri Mahakala Deva!   Six armed Mahakala, his skin blue, smelling of sulfer, my eyes fix on the wreathed crown on his head of skulls, the skulled scepter in his hand, the bodies of those who have broken their oaths  underneath him.  He is the Protector.   Kh. Karthar reminds us :                 “Mahakala is seen standing on the corpse of two human bodies,                  thus symbolizing the death of negativities and the complete uprooting                  of negative patterns to such a point that, like the dead body, they will                  not come to life.  HUM HUM MAHAKALA PRASIDE PRASIDE HRIM HRIM SVAHA  three times, pronounced in the Virat meter, each time his presence on this plane solidifies more.  I do not need to feel him inside of me, we are each other.  He is my bargaining chip to the Baron.  I am Time-that-Returns.  The Baron and I are the same.  He cannot destroy me and I cannot be conquered.  My offer is absolute.  He must ride me and grant me my boons.    Mahakala belches, flame erupts from his mouth, cleansing me.  His name means  Great Time , he is the  Great Dark One .  He is Lord Shiva dancing the  tandava , breaking the  Kala-chakra , attuning the Universe and Life, the key to reality, giving the unknown teachings…    “ Ritual Practice  		 Students do not generally do practices associated with  dharmapalas  such 		as Mahakala until they have completed preliminary or Foundation Practices 		and of course, after receiving the empowerment to do so.   I am  Indrajit , a Tantric Adept and Master, I am Born Great of Mahakala, and a Dark Priest of Lord Shiva.  It is through Mahakala’s protection, through my need and desires for my wishes fulfilled, an antidote to my suffering, and a desire to have my Time returned to me, that I am become Mahakala.  “Bodhisattva Mahakala is the Dharma Protector of all Buddha fields: 		 Om, Shri  Mahakala Yaksha Betli,  hung dsa ”  Time bows before my will and I feel the air in my small house compress…   Sex & Death   the Harlequin Prince, I hear a laugh, then a chortle, and then a rushing of air.  He is inside me, he is me.  I am him.  I am now, having always been, the Harlequinade…  ‘Harlequin, Columbine, Clown, and Pantaloon!”  Now finally the Baron…I stand before him, my alter Voodoo.  I have never done this before.  I am not scarred, I am excited, I am a big-breasted Haitian woman, I am an old emaciated Haitian man, my French is horrible.  I am perfect.  I have not prepared rum.  I give the Baron only the best.  I laugh a deeply nasal guttural laugh.  Dancing around within my protective circle.  I do not want the Baron to get out.  He is mine.  I light up one of the cigars I had made for him as an offering.    The alter is set with cognac, vermouth, sambooka, and as a gift, a bottle of Grey Goose.  Smoke billows from my mouth and I am laughing, the Harlequin Prince is having his way with me and I leap about, deliberately crossing backwards, the Baron always stands ready at the cross-roads of reality.  The wrap will not come off the bottle of Grey Goose…I move to leave the circle and then laugh…  I unleash the spirits from their bottle, pour a glass full, pull a swallow, and then spew delicious French vodka to the four corners.  I feel the Baron coming a little closer.   Entre Moi, Baron, S’il Vous Plait. Entre Moi Entre Moi  Baron, Protége Mon Ami Mort, Christophe Merwin, S’il Vous Plait Facilite leur traversée… Merci, Mon Baron !   A noticeable difference.  He is inside me now.  I feel as if I am drunk already; it is what the Baron does.   Driving I discover the Baron likes contemporary Hip-hop .  Two hours later...this time I really am drunk…stumbling home. I have secreated sex for you, I have become death, I have made of me a Fool...  I hope you appreciated what I have done for you, you meddlesome Bastard… Apparently I'm not as good as I think I could be... I learn later that I have succeeded in summoning you...you were well repressented... I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship… Let this be the end for me of this Lust, this culture of sex, of the emptiness of mere bodies...   Sex & Death   [The ritual shamans of the northern Russia steppes would invoke and take on the totem animal forms of savage animals, becoming wild and mad, for the purpose of taking on the animals more beastial qualities so that they could remove  them from the presence of the villagers and in so doing ensure harmony, both within their own souls and the community at large.

         …the opposition between  one  and  two  (etc.); everything plays itself out despite or against the distinction between perception and dream, perception and memory, consciousness and the unconscious, the real and the imaginary, story and discourse, etc.  Beyond these oppositions or  between  these terms, but not in total confusion.  In a different distribution.   Two  is no more an accident of  one  than  one  is a secondary surplus of  zero  (or vice versa), unless we reconsider our whole notion of the values of accident, secondariness, and surplus: the sole condition for being able at last to consider the text, in the movement of its constellation, which always proceeds by number.  Far from being simply erased, the oppositions deactivated by this arithmetical theater are, in the same blow, reactivated, thrown back into play, but this time as effects, not rules, of the game.  Since the trace can only imprint itself by referring to the other, to another trace (‘the trace of its reflection’), by letting itself be upstaged and forgotten, its force of production strands in necessary relation to the energy of its erasure.  The power of expropriation…  -Jacques Derrrida, “The Politics of Friendship”

        "Thank God for Mom and Dad stikin' two together because we don't know how... ...You think you've got it, oh you think you've got it! But got it just dont get it untill there's nothing at all...But seperate's always better when there's feelings involved...If what they say is "nothing is forever"..then what makes love the exception?"  and i think about how many times my parents have said this to me, how lucky i am that both my parents have been married to each other for over forty years, and how they tell me i just dont carry any of the baggage from seperation...and really how little that means to me, and what other kind of baggage i in turn must carry...the burden that every time they fight i worry, i think, "my god, this is it...", or how i carry this idealized notion about how a relationship should be, like i want the american dream, like i must be fucked up because i believe in relationships that should last forever, or how i want to marry someone who loves me, and believe that they will do anything, everything, that will move to try and make this relationship last.  why is it strange to believe that i should like my spouse as a person, as my best friend, and want to see their dreams acknowledged as much, but not at the cost of, my own?  Why must I be fated for divorce or worse, never to be married, because I believe that my commitment to my partner is for life?  And its a shame to admit that I must be fucked because i'll forgive her anything as long as she tries, and as long as she takes responsibility for her Self (instead of me taking responsibility for her?)...and i look around and all i see is people telling me, "no, you just move on...", endless moving, and that's all we are left with...  love is endlessly moving on...

        I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

Only I will remain  --Frank Herbert Dune   Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear. –Mark Twain,  Pudd’nhead Wilson   I have done this before, I can do this again and accept whatever happens, I will continue on, again until I have become.

        The blow of the sign...the ultimate blow of the sign is not its abscence (pres-ab-scence), but rather its never having been inscribed.    "The first consequence to be drawn from this is that the signified concept is never present in and of itself, in a sufficient presence that would refer only to itself.  Essentially and lawfully, every concept is inscribed in a chain or in a system within which it refers to the other, to other concepts, by means of the systematic play of differences.  Such a play,  différance , is thuis no longer simply a concept,  but rather the possibility of conceptuality, of a conceptual process and system in general."                   - Jacques Derrida, " Différance ", Paris, 1968.  The différance of the word, a word, its trace,  its distanciation, always-already promises the hope of return (the lexicon is limited,  it is bound, the covers of the dictionary itself) - a return of the sign.  It is this return of the, a, sign, the return of the self in Heidegger's [ Der Begriff der Zeit ]  being-ahead-of-its-self , The sign always returns in the presence of its abscence.    "Let us go on.  It is because of  différance  that the movement of signification is possible only if each so-called present element, each element appearing on the scene of presence, is related to something other than itself, thereby keeping within itself the mark of the past element, and already letting itself be vitiated by the mark of its relation to the future element, this trace being related no less to what is called the future than to what is called the past, and constituting what is called the present by means of this very relation to what it is not..."                   - Jacques Derrida, " Différance ", Paris, 1968.  The only way for the sign to deliver its  coup de grace ,  that is to say, its  coup de signe , is for the sign to have never been a sign,  to have never been signified and never have the possiblity of being signified.   In essence then, the coup de signe is always-already its own inscription, which is to say, its own very being signified in its return.  "In constituting itself, in dividing itself dynamically, this interval is what might be called  spacing , the becoming-space of time or the becoming-time of space ( temporization )."                   - Jacques Derrida, " Différance ", Paris, 1968.  " Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words, words will never hurt me..."   Bob Dylan:  I accept chaos. I am not sure whether it accepts me...Experience teaches us that silence terrifies people the most.

This space exists for the very disruption of the Sorrowful and as the name suggests it is a turning away, a protection from, the negative by casting it out from the private sphere into the realm of the public.  It is the dissolution of the They-self before the They with the ownmost self-constituting self remaining behind in the privation of the authentically acknowledged self...

        A 'has-been' [Eng. a 'has been', a loser, a drop out, a failure] is French argot, slang, that has been borrowed directly into colloquial French for someone who exhibits the same qualities as the often English, especially American, understanding of the same term.  The term is a straight linguistic borrowing, pronounced in French as une 'haz-bin'.  E.g. A person who was formerly very succesful at something, enjoyed a certain glory or status, was seen as important, but is now regarded as someone who keeps trying but failing at something, a relationship, a professional pursuit (school), an idea, their own (lacking) level of intelligence, or just someone who is washed up, dried out, doesn't get it, and who should give up, accept and move on, but doesn't.  A person who thinks they are better than they are actually regarded.  A 'haz-bin' can apply to any and all walks of life.       backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        "The freedom of consciousness relieves this need, and inhibits the annihilating in enjoyment, through consciousness itself ( durch sich selbst ); that makes the two sexes into  consciousness for one another, into beings and subsisters for one another...in such a way that in the being-for-itself of the other, each is itself...  And the sexual relationship comes to be that in which each other is one with the other in being of the consciousness of each one, in other words, an ideal relation. Desire frees itself from its relationship with enjoyment; it becomes an immediate being-one ( Einssein ) of both in the absolute being for-(it)self of both, i.e., it becomes  love ; and the enjoyment is in this intuiting ( Anschauen ) of one-self in the being of the other consciousness. The relationship itself becomes in the same way the being of both and a relationship as durable ( bleibende ) as the being of both, that is, it becomes  marriage ."                      -G.W.F.

         urlLink Dionysius of Halicarnassus , the Greek historian of Rome, living in the first century before the common era, personifies the ancient Greek term,  pistis , in his great multi-volume history of Rome, as  pistis demosia , equating it to the Latinate,  fides publica .    Now, so far from his time, but certainly perhaps not from his voice, his essential historicization, we have come to understand the Roman   fides   as:    trust  in a person or thing,  faith, confidence, reliance, credence, belief  (syn.: fidelitas, fiducia, confidentia).  We define the Greek   pistis   in much the same way:   trust  in others,  faith ,  persuasion  of a thing,  confidence ,  assurance .  Plato describes   pistis   (  Republic  , Book VI,  510b-511e) as being in the lowest category of knowledge, that of opinion (  doxa  ), and only just above the lowest form of knowledge, which is illusion (  eikasia  ).   Eikasia  is regarded as mere ignorance, a belief in shadows and illusory things, while  pistis  ranks just beyond this.    It seems that for both Plato and Dionysius democracy is constituted by a form of  pistis .   God Bless America !   Thus, according to men’s opinions, did things come into being, and thus they are now. In time (they think) they will grow up and pass away.   -Parmenides of Elea, " On Nature "    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

         from   A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis: Theory and Technique , Bruce Fink.  Lacan's use of the term "dialectic" here (the "dialectic of desire") does not mean that desire follows the widely taught version of Hegel's dialectic- affirmation, negation, synthesis; it means that  desire is set in motion, set free of the fixation inherent in demand .  This is a momentous step, and it signals the analysand's true entry into analysis.  I do not mean to imply that the patient's desire is set in motion once and for all, and never gets stuck or bogged down at any point thereafter.  Rather, a first exchange occurs: the patient agrees to accept the pleasure of desire in exchange for his or her initial demands.   With certain patients, however, the analyst is never able to elicit a question of any kind; the patient does not wonder about any of the things she did or said in the past, and does not problematize anything she says or does in her  present relationship with the analyst.  Though the patient continues to come to talk with the analyst, she never sees anything else in what she says than what she meant.  The unconscious is never accepted, the imaginary (meaning) predominating.  This may imply one of two things.  The patient may be psychotic...;or the analyst may not  have created a space in which desire can come to the fore, and thus needs to reconsider his or her own position in the therapy.    The latter is likely to involve an oppressive demand that the patient talk, talking being associated for certain patients with performing, and simply giving other people what they want to hear as opposed to speaking "one's own" thoughts and desires.

        The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth?   Assuredly.   But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel.   True.   He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasure -- I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.   [485e]  That is most certain.   Such a one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no place in his character.   Very true.   Another criterion of [486a] the philosophical nature has also to be considered.   What is that?   There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human.

        “The relation with the death of the other is not a  knowledge  [ savoir ] about the death of the other, nor the experience of that death in its particular way of annihilating being (if, as is commonly thought, the event of this death is reducible to this annihilation).  There is no knowledge of this ex-ceptional relation (‘ex-ception’ meaning here to grasp and to set outside the series).  This annihilation is not phenomenal, nor does it give rise to anything like a coincidence of consciousness with it (yet those are the two dimensions of knowledge).  From the death of the other, pure knowledge (i.e. lived experience [ vécu ], coincidence) retains only the external appearances of a process (of immobilization) whereby someone who up until then expressed himself, comes to an end…It is an emotion, a movement, a disquietude within the unknown… 	 Would not the dis-quiet of emotion be the question that, in the nearness of death, is precisely at the point of being born?  An emotion in the sense of a deference toward death; in other words, an emotion as a question that does not contain, in the posing of the question, the elements of its own response.  A question that attaches to that deeper relation [ rapport ] to the infinite, which is time (time understood as the relation to the infinite).  An emotional relation [ rapport ] with the death of the other [ l’autre ].  A fear or a courage, but also, beyond the compassion for and solidarity with the other, responsibility for him in the unknown.  But this unknown is not, in its turn, objectified and thematized, aimed at or seen; it is rather a disquietude wherein an interrogation interrogates itself yet is not convertible into a response; a disquietude wherein the response is reduced to the responsibility of the questioning itself [ du questionnant ] or of the one who questions [ du questionneur ].  	Time is not the limitation of being but its relationship with infinity.  Death is not annihilation but the question that is necessary for this relationship with infinity, or time, to be produced.”  		-Emmanuel Levinas,  Death of the Other and My Own . 1975 (2000).      backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        Solitude Standing  Silence. The things that are said in the negation of the space, silence is the dedistancing.  It is what is the  not -said in the not, such that the cancellation of this negation does nothing but speak.  It speaks in the absence of its language and the presence of its realization in its silence.  It is the silence of the momment of return.  The returning home of the negation of the dedistancing of language before the presence of self-remaining.  The copula of the identification, the erasure of the very  is  in the relation to its Being.  It is the being-present in the very pre-sentation of the subject as own very self in the cancellation of the objectification of the sign before its signification.  It is the very realization of the actuality of the re-turn.   The turning from the already having been, turned .  It is the very presentation of the self in its self returning as  self .  It is the cancellation and erasure but not the negation of the very presentation of signification.  It is always already re-turned as the own very  is .  - in honorum Delta Chi.     backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        And you open the door and step inside - We're inside our hearts.  Now imagine your pain is a white ball of healing light.  This is your life, good to the last drop.  It doesn't get any better than this.  This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.  This isn't a seminar, this isn't a weekend retreat.  Where you are now you can't even imagine what the bottom will be like.  Only after disaster can we be resurrected.  It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything.  Nothing is static, everything is falling... everything is falling apart.  You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.  You are the same organic decaying matter as everything else.  We are all a part of the same compost heap.  We are the all singing, all dancing, crap of the world.  You are not your bank account.  You are not the clothes you wear.  You are not the contents of your wallet.  You are not your bowel cancer.  You are not your grande latte.  You are not the car you drive.  You are not your fucking khackies!  You have to give up.  You have to realize that some day you will die.  Until you know that, you are useless.  I say, let me never be complete.  I say, may I never be content.  I say, deliver me from swedish furniture!  I say, deliver me from clever art!  I say, deliver me from clear skin and perfect teeth!  I say, you have to give up.

         seven months later  and we are laying and looking at each other...there is a conversation that is passing between us that is maintained in the movement of our lips, the brushing of our fingers, and the language of our skin.  and for the first time in years i get to see a part of myself that i thought i had lost, an intimacy that had left me when she had, and a lingering doubt that i could never be of any meaning or value to a woman again.  and for a brief momment, in momments of reflection, i think about that momment, those seven months ago, when we sat on a cliff top watching the sun set, when i had wanted her to want me so badly...i think about the passing months in which i was convenced that she never would, and i think about the language in which our bodies now speak to each other in, and for a brief momment again i remember, i truly remember, that sometimes, just sometimes, the Universe gives you what you need.  Somehow none of my friends realize how important this is to me, how important the sense of my own trust in myself is, they don't realize how much i truly need this, and the sense of wonder it comes with, the faith i have again, almost (but not yet)...in the things that come from myself.    So when the young and beautiful Irish girl finally sets sail to the south, digging in the past, i hope she realizes just how much of mine she has already restored.    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

         So about a year ago I walked into my favorite, if such a term can be used, cafe with my roommate.  The cafe is located just off of campus and is a nice kind of dirty modernist art example of a coffee shop.  All the employees are somewhat jaded, dissident, and live within the "alternative" framework (even for Austin's standards) of society.  All of the employees are my friends.  They smoke during their breaks, hate yuppies, make fun of the Scientologists who come in for their lattés, smirk at sorority girls and euro-trash, and have a very Clerk's-esque attitude.  "Fuck you, I work here".    My roommate and I meander upstairs to the bare brick and hard wood smoking area, with its chrome chairs that not even the most tenacious person could find comfortable and easily shattered glass tables.  We find a table against the wall and set our bags, arm load of books, and cigarettes down.  He looks up and waves to someone and tells me he's going to go say hi to her.  I look up and see a beautiful blond girl, her hair cut like Audrey Hepburn, with a beaming smile and a Camel in her mouth.  She's cute, petite, and radiant, wearing a tight baby T that says "Taste my Peach".  She's indie heroin sheik, everything I could desire in a girl based on solely on appearances.  I'm smitten immediately and try, with great conviction, to slowly sachet down to where she and my roommate are talking.  His cell phone rings, and like an Aryan businessman he immediately fishes in his pocket and whips it out, professionally taking the call, saying, "This is Dheeraj."  In-between blustrations he waves at the girl and then says to me, hand held protectively over the receiver, "I've gotta go".  I take the opportunity to sit down, introduce myself, and ask if I can smoke a cigarette.  She gladly accepts, but says she can't talk for too long; she's got to study for her organic chemistry exam.  She hasn't been to class all month and she needs to maintain her high A average.  Inwardly I smile.  Cute and lazy.  Just like me.  We talk for almost an hour, about music, about anthropology (her major), about chemistry and biology, about Austin and mutual friends that we have.  She's assertive and confident about what she knows and is very obviously sure of herself and who she wants to be.  It doesn’t even occur to her to flaunt that she's beautiful enough to be a model; she'd rather talk about the genetic distribution of cells in plants and their gestation cycles.  I look at my clock and realize that is almost time for the last bus, nearly midnight.  If I am going to make it home without begging someone for a ride I need to be outside soon to catch the bus and my sad impoverished and insane chariot home to my little house up north.  I always try to get there early, the bus is never on time, and it’s a two mile walk back home.  She's told me about her feelings on relationships, how she believes in always being loyal to her boyfriend and that communication is the key, you have to try and understand each other.  Its not just enough to flirt and be coy, you have to really be serious, serious about having fun, dedicated to putting an effort in, whether you are upset, or whether you just want to be romantic.  She says she believes in wooing her boy as much as he woos her.  I'm standing by the bus stop, a hundred yards off from the coffee shop and downstairs from a girl that has me positively beaming.  In a town of flirtation and sex and the quick hook-up at a bar, with one, or two, or three different people in the course of an evening, she seems genuine.  To a heart that is still wracked by betrayal, by dishonesty, by a relationship built on serious intentions that were given up for girlish superficiality, tossed of like all the clothing and erotic love of an Anais Nin vacation, she is an honest person.  I've never thought I would meet a girl like her again.  I thought I had deluded myself into believing that they existed anymore or that I had even ever known any.  I still have 12 minutes before the bus comes.  I am pacing anxiously.  I've already smoked another cigarette, even though I had one not 15 minutes ago with girl.  I am desperately trying to remember her name and wondering if the next time I can see her again could be now.    I cross the street again, walk through the cafe and upstairs to her table.  She is staring down at her book, intently, looks up and smiles.  "I just wanted to say thank you.  You are quite possibly one of the most beautiful girls I have met in Austin, and more importantly, you have renewed my faith in women, that someone honest can actually still exist.  Anyway, I need to go now, but if you want to grab a drink sometime, let me know."  She smiles, taken aback.  I don’t really have time to wait for a response.  I smile my big goofy smile and run down the stairs.  The bus is coming, it’s right in front of me and I sprint across the street so I can flash my University ID to the driver.  Legs concrete like jelly, stomach rumbling with a 1000 butterflies preserved in caffeine formaldehyde, and a shit eating grin.  "I just did something good" I whisper to the night and myself.     backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        One must begin and end then with the act of the copula.  In  Die Grundprobleme der Phänomenologie  [GA 24], Heidegger speaks of the theory of double judgement within the logical works of Herman Lotze, sighting Lotze's small  Logik  by glossing, out of context, that the "copula, which combines as well as separates" with Aristotle's assesment of the copula of the assertion as both  sunthesis  and  diairesis .  The purpose for the ressurection of Lotze's logic is precisely the negation and privalging of the  Logik  in Hegel, thus Heidegger states that it 'is' - "an attempt to come to terms with Hegel, but it is still very much influenced by Hegel."    Thus we may maintain in a factical way concerning our attunement toward the copula with regard toward the silence of its presence (... words in progress ...) as follows {citing Heidegger}: "in negative judgement, the negation is only a new, second judgement about the truth of the first, which latter properly has to be thought as positive.  The second judgment is a judgment about the truth or falsehood of the first."  Thus the judgment of the second serves for us rather than as a negation and denial of the metaphysical truthfulness of the initial being-directed-towards, but rather an interpretation of the epitemological, understood more broadly within the factical life world as the larger and more profound hermenteutic interpretation of, presentation, that is the enframing of the assertion in its negation, the second judgment.  It must be understood then what we mean by this very term factical [ faktisch ] with regards to the modes of being-directed-toward, glossed from  Aussein auf  [being out toward], related initially with the concept of intentionality toward 'what it gives to the wholeness of Dasein, always "out toward what it is not but can be" [thus], transforming its sense in the direction of the pure possibility of ek-static temporality.'(Kisiel, 492).  What is essential in being understood here is that the possibility of this ecstatic temporality is achieved through the very authenticity (q.v.) of the Dasein in its various modes of attunment, most notably  here  the character of the mood(/mode) of  love , by which Dasein comes to become aware of its call-to-conscience and the very possibility of its authenticity.  Thus we will recall Heidegger as saying:       If we recall what we ourselves said about perception, the concept of intentionality can, to begin with,     be made clear as follows.  Every comportment is a comporting-toward; perception is a perceiving-of.     We call this comporting-toward in the narrower sense the intendere or intentio.  Every comporting-toward     and every being-directed-toward  [Hofstadter trans]  has its specific  wherto of the comporting       and  toward-which of the directedness.  Heidegger continues a few pages later, by saying, importantly for us,  here , that is now, in the priority of our moment:   We therefore  {in discussing  intentionality }  distinguish not only terminologically but also for reasons of intrinsic content between the  uncoveredness of a being  and the  disclosedness of its being.   A being can be uncovered, whether, by way of perception or some other mode of access, only if the being of this being is already disclosed - only if I already understand it.   Only then can I ask whether it is actual or not and embark on some procedure to establish the actuality of the being.  We must then conclude, in all honesty, not with a conclusion, but rather an openning-into, by making a returned reference in the infite differment of our dialogue to the discussion of facticity, that is the very factical life which becomes Dasein: [Hofstader trans]          Dasein understands its own most peculiar being in the sense of a certain 'factual extantness'.    And yet the 'factuality' of the fact of our own Dasein is fundamentaly different from the factual occurrence    of some sort of mineral.  The factuality of the Faktum Dasein, as which at each time each Dasein is,    we call  facticity .  The complicated structure of this determination of being can itself    be grasped  as a problem  only in the light of the basic existential constitution of the Dasein    which have already been elaborated.  The concept of facticity contains within itself:    The being-in-the-world of an 'intraworldly' being in such a way that this being can understand itself as closely    bound up in its  'destiny'  with the being of the beings which it encounters within its own    world.

         'How can another see into me, into my most secret self, without my being able to see in there myself? And without my being able to see him in me. And if my secret self, that which can be revealed only to the other, to the wholly other, to God if you wish, is a secret that I will never reflect on, that I will never know or experience or possess as my own, then what sense is there in saying that it is my secret, or in saying more generally that a secret belongs, that it is proper to or belongs to some one, or to some other who remains someone. It's perhaps there that we find the secret of secrecy. Namely, that it is not a matter of knowing and that it is there for no one. A secret doesn't belong, it can never be said to be at home or in its place. The question of the self: who am I not in the sense of who am I but rather who is this I that can say who?

        “You realize that she doesn’t give second dates?” “What do you mean?” “Well, if you’ve been out with her more than once…” “Yeah, we’ve gone out a couple of times…” “Then it means that she’s at least thinking about it.”  We are driving down one of the inner campus drives around toward the stadium and where I work.  I’m a little bit buzzed, we had just come back from a nice little pub downtown, the most amazing “pizza” fries (minus the pepperoni) and a beautifully worn multi-tiered wooden deck that feels warm and inviting in the afternoon sun.  At this point I’m not even sure why we had gone there, it might have been in preparation, celebration just doesn’t seem appropriate, for her upcoming trip down to Belieze.  We had had several drinks, Guinness, naturally, and I had tried to flirt in my non-assuming, “yeah, I like you, but I’m not going to make the first move, and I respect your space” kinda way.    This had been the mode that I had been in for the past year and a half, at least consciously.  For a male in our society it’s a pretty unsuccessful mode to be in, “I’m going to wait for the girl to make the first move, because then I’ll know she likes me”.  Problem was I didn’t let anyone else know that, and most girls I know love the thrill of the chase and of finally “being caught”.  It was a psychological thing for me, after feeling so insecure about myself for so long, feeling like I wasn’t desirable, feeling like a girl couldn’t possibly like me as anything other than a pair of legs, a cock, and a brain with a mouth, I needed to have someone actually pursue me.  I needed to feel like if I was going to be getting into a situation then it had better be because she liked me as a person.  There’s a pretty simple rule of attraction that is tacitly passed on to males, if you give her attention, make her feel like she’s wanted (whether you want her or not), then you’ll get what you want.    This whole fucking social paradigm nauseated me.  It made me realize that it made me, the "aggressor", just as empty and vapid and shallow as it did the person I was "hitting on". {Thank you social linguistics - Women, Fire & Dangerous Things}  Most idiots can learn to say the right things, play the right moves, and then *boom* you wonder why a girl so smart and so beautiful and confident is sleeping with a total chump.  I was sick of this inverted paradigm, sick of hearing about how guys are such assholes and how all a guy is interested in is sex, blah, blah, blah.   	Here’s a secret about Austin.  Austin’s a hook-up town, rated number one in the country for dating, yet I can count on one hand the number of “couples” I know.  The secret is this: girls run this town.  They control “the scene” by deciding who to give their number out to, who to talk to, and about what and when and around whom, what the topics of conversation range from and are not allowed to border on, etc. ad nauseum.  The vast majority of my friends in Austin are girls, I think most of them see me as sexually harmless because 1) I’m sweet (I was told that girls don’t go after sweet guys), 2) I was hung-up on my ex for a really long time.  So I, de facto, became “the gay friend” to all of my “fairer” friends, only without being gay.  And Lo! suddenly I was an ethnographer in the land of the feminine…privy to the “inner”  experience of the feminine, of the posturing and maneuvering that goes on in the quest to be desired.  Not the quest to desire, but the quest  to be  desired. 	For the first time I could understand in a deeply personal way how all the girls I have been truly friends with would get upset about the objectification of women, about the marginalization of her actually personality to just what she looked like or how she acted.  I had understood before intellectually, but now I could see it for myself, it was happening to me, it had happened already to me.    So I had resolved in my heart, and mostly in my mind, that the only way I would pursue a girl, seriously persue her, actually put my heart into it, was if she pursued me.  It was a comfort and security I needed for myself, it is a comfort and security I still need.  So when I had told Girl that she was one of the few that had showed me any honesty, that had renewed my faith and trust in women as feminine, I meant it.  I felt like here was finally someone who might actually see me as a person, as an other.  I’m almost at work.  She is dropping me off.  The day is beautiful, it’s warm and sunny, and the breeze is the kind in which you wish, for just a moment, that you were a leaf.  “I told you weeks ago that I have a boyfriend.”  “No.  You didn’t.”  She stops looking at me and stares forward.  I stare out the window of the car.  The warm breeze is suddenly oppressive and I want nothing more than to get out of the car and walk (roll?) away.  “Yes I did,” she says quietly, sternly.  “No. You didn’t” 	“You can let me out here.”  She pulls off to the side, I pause for a moment.  I don’t want to be dramatic, but I can’t stand this.  I can’t stand being dupped, having my hopes built up, genuinely believing that maybe I had a chance at something other than just a meaningless cycle of desiring and being desired.  And what was worse is that suddenly I thought about him…how would he feel if he knew (the asshole probably wouldn’t have cared, but I didn’t know that at the time)?  Once someone cheats on you, you become really sensitive to the invisible boundaries of relationships.  I had finally learned my lesson.  I never wanted to do this again.  Ever. Fuck women.  An Italian drinking-buddy of mine, a retired professor, interspersed between Spanish, French, and German told me once:  "...Its not that women have changed.  That's the problem.  Men have."

          Verfallen, Verfallenheit  (Falling, Fallenness):  § 36.  Die Neugier  (Curiosity)  Under the general structure of ‘Falling’ in Sein und Zeit, § 36 the term neugier (curiosity) is introduced as a general mode of Dasein’s tendency to become absorbed in the world of the-They by constantly acting as an explorer without ever maintaining a sense of presence.  Heidegger elucidates this notion in the following way:   Die freigewordene Neugier besorgt aber zu sehen, nicht um das Gesehene zu verstehen, das heißt in ein Sein zu ihm zu konnen, sondern nur um zu sehen.  Sie sucht das Neue nur, um von ihm  erneut zu Neuem abzuspringen.  Nicht um zu erfassen und um wissend in der Wahrheit zu sein, geht es der Sorge dieses Sehens, sondern um Möglichkeiten des Sichüberlassens an die Welt.  Daher ist die Neugier durch ein spezifisches  Unverweilen  beim Nächsten charakterisiert.  Sie sucht daher auch nicht die Muße des betrachtenden Verweilens, sondern Unruhe und Aufregung durch das immer Neue  und den Wechsel des Begegnenden.  In ihrem Unverweilen besorgt die Neugier die ständige Möglichkeit der  Zerstreuung .  ( Sein und Zeit , 172).    When curiosity has become free, it takes care to see not in order to  understand what it sees, that is, to come to a being toward it, but only in order to see.  It seeks novelty only to leap from it again to another novelty.  The care of seeing is not concerned with comprehending and knowingly being in the truth, but with possibilities of  abandoning {leaving-itself-over} itself to the world.  Thus curiosity is  characterized by a specific  not-staying  with what is nearest.  Consequently,  it also does not seek the leisure of reflective staying, but rather restlessness and excitement from continual novelty and changing encounters.   In not-staying, curiosity makes sure of the constant possibility of  distraction .  ( Being and Time  , 161).  However, even prior to his general outline of the term Verfallen (and its subsequent gloss, ‘verfallenheit’, fallingness’), Heidegger develops the structure of ‘curiosity’ (neugier – lit. ‘new-er’, one who is involved in things which are perpetual presented as ‘new’) out of a longer standing tradition of religious contemplation coupled with an etymological tracing.  Heidegger seeks to bring to awareness the etymological relationship of curiosity, better preserved in English, by looking at its Latin etymology,  curiosus  (underwhich lies the cognate  curiositas ), in association with the Latin  cura , hence English ‘cure’ and for Heidegger more importantly ‘care’.  The Latin seems to more originarily maintained the suggestion of ‘the quality of diligent and assiduous care before it degenerated into zealous but superfluous concern of inquisitiveness’. (Kisiel, 531).  Heidegger considers this philosophical etymology significant enough in terms of a schematic for the constitution of Dasein that he mentions it at least twice, in 1922 and later again in 1923. 	  “…this term does not express any negative evaluation, but is used to signify that Dasein is proximally and for the most part alongside the world of its concern. This “absorption-in” has mostly the character of Being-lost in the publicness of the ‘they’. Dasein has, in the first instance, fallen away from itself as an authentic potentiality for Being its Self, and has fallen into the world”.  “Anticipation reveals to Dasein its lostness in the They-self, and brings it face to face with the possibility to be itself, primarily unsupported by concerned taking care of things, but to be itself in passionate anxious freedom toward death which is free of the illusions of the they, factical, and certain of itself”      backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        God I hope this doesn’t come out simply as some form of philosophical confusion, that instead, like all my writing, I want the language, the words to somehow paint a picture, show a form and a structure, and then recede into the background so that at some point you open up your eyes and realize that you haven't been reading for sometime, that instead, the words have pulled you in, beyond them, through an infinite doorway, into a whole other place that shows something else, something more originary, more primordial, something more real than even words.  By the time I really fell in love with you, with you and not for you, you had already gone from my life.  It occurred to me with shocking clarity one star-filled night when I was lying in bed with my girlfriend at the time.  We were in her upstairs loft watching the ceiling, through a skylight which showed the twinkling of the majestic milky stars that can only be understood from someone who has lived high in the foothills of the mountains.  We talked endlessly like all couples do, in the search for themselves in the other, in the search for the other in themselves; we talked about her brother, my siblings, her childhood with her religiously overbearing mother, a mother who now slept not two-hundred feet below us in a closed room down the stairs from our little warm loft.  And we turned, as at some point all couples do, to the topic of our firsts, of those that came before us and with whom we must still compete, for the absent other, undefeatable because of their lack of presence, whom we can only hope to someday be equal to or replace, stand next to upon the pedestals that make up the museum of love and courtship.  She turned her head slightly to me, her chestnut brown tresses, curled with a slight wave, fell across her face and whispered their presence softly upon the pillow.  We had said that we had loved each other some time ago, the words instinctive to me, words that when I was younger, as you know, I let fly freely without ever truly understanding what they meant, yet even still, I would not take back a single utterance of that devastating phrase, because I meant every one of them, and still do, I just didn’t understand what I was saying when I summoned their binding interlocking power.  And for the first time ever someone finally challenged my love, I understood what love meant beyond what I had been pulling up through my blood and pouring out through my heart.  She said to me, You aren't really in love with me, you're in love with love.  For a brief moment I recoiled, the intense ecstatic fear of loss and abandonment, the horrifying and paralyzing fear that she would simply disappear on the spot, there would be no break up, no exchange of sorrows and sympathies, no challenging accusations, she would simply cease to be, so strong was the force of utterance of this vaulted statement.  It was as if the High Priest of the Temple had just uttered the ineffable names of G-d before Don Juan, smug and content with himself for his own most recent conquest.  Years later as I read Camus' the Myth of Sisyphus this experience would stick with me and I would recall my own first sense of existential freedom found as "the Lover".  She was right, of course she was right.  I was in love with love and had been since my very first.  Because in every woman I had found her again, in every love I had found some sort of access to her present absence.  And suddenly with these words my comfortable world of delusion fell, the warm blanket of love and conquest which had constructed my Don Juanian notebook of sensual experiences suddenly empty and meaningless as I realized that my first love was no longer with me, and never would be again.  I realized the whole map and terrain of my affairs up until and even beyond that point and realized that in each instance I was dealing with someone radically new, someone wholly other, and that this delusion of love existed in me and in name only.  This act of tyranny, this blatant irresponsibility was crushing.  So much that I in fact wanted the girl with the beautiful chestnut tresses next to me  to  disappear, to absolve me of my guilt, to release me from the burden that I owed to each and every lover I had ever had and ever would have, to allow me to return to the comfortable place that I had dwelled in before, the existential freedom of never having to regard your lover as their very own.  Of course she turned to me and said, You think I'm right don't you, a pause, I know you are.  I burned my eyes into the ceiling hoping to ignite the beams into a starry fire so that I could see the sky unbridled, to flee up into them, the vast milky distance a home to save me from my self.  I could not run away from this, I could not hide, my entire life I had sworn the oath passed on to me by my father, And this above all, to thine own self be true, and yet in so doing I realized the truth, the duty to be true to others, to recognize them as their ownselves.  And finally in the midst of all of this, in this silence so stark, underneath a sky filled with stars, burned off by my absolution, I saw my release, my atonement.  It wasn't enough to regard every future lover as their own, as the other to me that they would be, but I had to liberate every past and present lover as well, to set them free from the vice within which I had placed them, to acknowledge each for their own very presence.  I fell in and out of love several times that night.  So many whom I had thought I loved, whom I had said that I loved, disappeared, never to be seen again in the chambers of my heart.  But so many more suddenly appeared to me as if fresh, each individual, amazing in and of her own right.  I yearned for each of their companies and saw the amazing fire that had burned in her, that could have burned between us both.  Years later I would track down each of them, as you know, the loved and the no longer loved, and beg forgiveness, sincere forgiveness.  There are a few who are still missing, either because I could not find them or because of something more insidious, who do not know...but for them I hold no ill will and only a deep and abiding respect and thanks.  But with you I had fallen in love with all over again, and still do. Such is the nature of who we are and what we always carry with us, of the openness, the "one-ness" (the one-in-two-ness maybe?) that comes out of real love.    There are so many for whom I still remain.  "So I guess I wanted to say thank you and your welcome and try try try to forgive us." - E.F.D.        backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

         It was on the highway at sunrise, after the second cafe had closed, that he said he was looking for a young woman to sleep with him for a while, because he was afraid of going out of his mind.   He wanted to pay her; he thought that women ought to be paid for keeping men from dying or going out of their minds.  He had wept again, exhausted as he was.  The summer frightened him. Their lonliness in the summer, when seaside resorts were full of couples and of women and children; when people made fun of them everywhere, at variety shows, in the casinos, in the streets. _________________________________________________________________________  And he says that now it's the opposite, he's always afraid she might leave while he's asleep. With her shut up with him in this room he's not completely parted from him, the lover with blue eyes, black hair.  He thinks it's in this room, with this theatrical light, that the beginning  of his love is to be sought, a beginning that dates from long before her, from the childhood summers that were like punishments.  He doesn't explain.  -Marguerite Duras, " Blue Eyes, Black Hair "    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        "it's really hard to think that i probably don't smile like that any more...but i guess smiles fade too."  I hope someday you will bring it back to you. Remember.  __________________________________________________________________________   An End to the Silence of Socrates    Prelude :  I have been suffering in silence now, the distancing silence that is made by waiting, waiting for an answer, waiting for an explanation, waiting for the uninvited guest, the guest who is always wanted but has yet to show.  It is a silence built upon living only a few blocks away, it is a silence built upon projections and miscommunications, upon grieving, lostness, and confusion.  It is a silence of waiting.   Salle d'attendant .  These are the forms of crippling silence, the types of silence that cause us to forget ourselves, to forget the ones we love most, and that put us into a stupor, a torpor of being, from which it is so hard to raise our-selves.  But now is a time of resurrection, now is a time of recusitation.  Before had passed the silence of distancing, now is time for the silence of appropriation.  My silence had been my own, my silence was forced upon me by myself, it was forced upon me by others, I was lost, they were lost.  We must each be refound.  Now is the time for rediscovering landmarks in old friends and lovers.  Now is the time for redirection.   Here is the beginning of the end of silence.  It is a Story with a Tale to come...   Maybe she didn’t know that after every time that he called her and she told him that she didn’t want to talk to him, or that if she wanted to she could go out and fuck any boy she wanted to at a show, or that if he called one more time she would stop talking to him, he called me.  He called me in hysteria, sobbing, tears streaming on the phone so that at first it was hard to tell it was him.  Or the number of times he said he just wanted to kill himself, or how if he knew it was going to be like this, if she was going to treat him like this, he would have never given her up, never set her free, never made that noble sacrifice.  And maybe she never knew that the advice I gave him was to tough it out, that if he really believed they were meant to be together, and on these nights he always did, that he could endure and see it through.  Maybe she didn’t know that I used myself as an example, maybe she didn’t know that I told him not to do the things that I had done, the things that I was doing, not to pressure her like I had K., not to back her into a corner and give her a reason to hate him, but to just give her space, to follow through with his promise, and not fuck things up the way I had.  Because even then, even back then I knew the pressure I was putting, that I had put, on K. was horrible.  And that lost patient K., so noble for the accusations and the confused lostness in my own desperate heart, put up with me and I am so incredibly sorry, so sorry that I don’t even begin to know where to apologize.  Maybe she didn’t know that I told him not to be like me.    And maybe she doesn’t remember that when K. and I drove down to pick her up, when he accused me of only coming down so that I could spend eight hours in a car trying to woo her back, as utterly hopeless as that was, that he and I then sat out on the roof for close to two hours and talked, and smoked, and cried.  Maybe she didn’t know what we talked about, that I admitted to him that yeah, maybe part of my motivation was in spending time with her, but that as fucked in the head as I was about her, and I was crazy, I was annoying, and crazy, and I knew it then, and I suffer for it daily now, that beyond all the crazyiness I came down to see my best friend, to spend time with one of the only people in the world that I loved, him.  And maybe she doesn’t know that I apologized to him, and that he apologized to me, and that we both hugged and we watched the street and talked about old times, and how he told me that regardless he was just happy that I did come down and that we were talking and hanging out with each other.  So when I hear that she is bitter at me for taking a day away from her, even though it meant I got to gain a day for me, that it hurts a lot.      And when I hear that she is angry at me because I compared his death to mine and K.’s break-up, maybe she doesn’t remember how carefully I said those words, that I said, “to me”, that I could understand the pain because “to me”, in my life, I know what its like to loose something precious.  But maybe she doesn’t realize that when he died I lost something too, I lost my best friend.      When K. and I broke up they only lost the stupidity with which we loved each other (replaced now by the stupidity with which we try and stay away from each other).    And its funny to hear that someone who you respect so tremendously that you sometimes put on a level higher than yourself, thinks that you treat them like a little girl.  And I guess maybe I never see and I will have to watch out for how I might be perceived as patronizing.  Just as she probably doesn’t realize that when she calls me an idiot for not liking certain films, or that I have poor taste in literature because I don’t like certain books, that I respect the fact that she knows more about it than I do, and how insulting her comments seem to me, but I always just let them slide.  So maybe now I will try extra hard not to seem like I am patting her on the head, but maybe if she tries hard not to call me stupid because I don’t like some of the bands she listens to.      And maybe we can stop just being Family for a little while, because that doesn’t mean much to me anymore, and we can start being friends again, because there is a lot about her I don’t know about, but I think is really really beautiful, …and I always have.    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

          Evanston, May, 2001    The Development of Fallingness [ Verfallenheit ; 'Falling-Prey' - Stambaugh trans.]:  During the Winter Semester of 1921 to 1922 (a full five years prior to the publication of  Being & Time  ) Heidegger delivered a lecture course at the University of Freiburg which has subsequently been entitled  Phenomenological Interpretations of Aristotle: Initiation into Phenomenological Research  [GA 61: Phänomenologische Interpretationen zu Aristotles].  The intended outline of the course was to offer a development of factical life and its unique relationship to the World as ‘care’.  Heidegger spends the first half of the semester orienting his students toward asking the question of what philosophy  is , with a suqsequent section devoted to appropriating how it is that [such] an understanding is grounded [Part II, Chapter 2: ‘The Appropriation of the Situation in Which Understanding is Rooted’].  By the end of this half of the course he is finally able to move on into the important discussion of factical life, later the factical life world, promised at the beginning of the course.  It is significant that upon the introduction to this section [Part III, Chapter I: ‘The Basic Categories of Life’], and prior to its first structural distinction [Part III, Chapter 1, Section A: ‘Life and World’], he presents the following designation:  	 Life as: 1. extension. 2. possibilities 3. fate (64) – Prevailing sense:  	     living = being (64) [Rojcewicz, vii.]   On the importance of ‘Fate’, Heidegger states:  	These three senses of the noun [“life”] contain the following structural  Indications, which are connected together categorically: the characters of extension, unity of succession, and manifold of actualization; the articulation as possibility, delivered over to possibility, developing possibility; furthermore, as reality, power in its opacity, fate. (Rojcewicz, 64) [ Self-ahead-of-the-self ].   Then in Chapter Two Heidegger introduces the counter-occurrence to the structural outline of Chapter One by offering a distinction centered around the development of the concept he terms ˝Ruinance˝.  This is summed up prior to the first section [Section A Part III, Chapter 2, Section A: ‘Tracing Back and Repeating the Interpretation’], as in the previous Chapter, by:  	 Ruinance of movedness, which “is” life in itself, as itself, for itself,       out of itself: i.e.,  against  itself (98) …{emphasis mine}     [ Rojcewicz, viii.]   Heidegger introduces Ruinance [ die Ruinanz ; better translated “Ruination”] in the following way:  	This movedness of factical life (a movedness which as such is produced 	by the world of factical life),  as it develops itself in this way and as it  thereby intensifies, in procuring itself for itself, can be called “collapse”; it is a movement which by itself forms itself – and yet not by itself but  by the emptiness in which it moves; its emptiness is its possibility of movement.  Thereby we acquire a basic sense of movedness of factical life, a sense we can fix in the term “ruinance” ( ruina  - collapse). 	A formally indicative definition would therefore determine ruinance as follows: the movedness of factical life which “actualizes” and “is”  factical life  in  itself,  as  itself,  for  itself,  out of  itself, and, in all this,  against  itself.  (Ontological sense of “is” – not yet determined.) [Rojcewicz, 98]  Kisiel, correctly, points out (Kisiel, 114) that this is Heidegger’s first discussion of what will later become in  Being & Time  “falling” [ Verfallen ] and more significantly that the character of “ruinance” and “falling” will emerge as a means, specifically a countermovement to the sense of receptive openness of the pure ego, by casting doubt upon such a methodology and seeing it as “utterly naïve and simplistic, and therefore dangerous.”    What is at stake here in this naïve letting-go is the very possibility for self actuality as authenticity.      backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        [Probably only up temporarily]   Truth is I miss being in a relationship.  A real relationship, where you deeply care about someone else, the adventure of the exploration of who they are, and who you are, and who you are together, and who you may be, maybe.  I haven’t been in a real relationship in four years.  I've dated, I've slept with a few people, but they were all seemingly empty relationships.  That is to say a relationship in which I was empty.  A one night stand, beautiful and unknown.  A chance encounter, but a painful one for me, probably for her, but completely for each of our own reasons that neither one had really known or understood.  We knew each other for 36 hours and then it was done; I was back on a plane and off away.  The pleasure and pain of Anais Nin.  The whole time I couldn't help but think of my ex-girlfriend, as if her spectre haunted me, taunting me to prove to her that I could sleep with someone who wasn't her, even after we had been broken up for a year already.  I later told her this and, of course, she was upset, tried to hide it, tried to deny her jealousy, to turn it down and away because she knew the real reason I did it was to try and sleep with her through another woman, just as she had slept with other men precisely because they weren't me.  Because of the adventure of the unknown, the girlish desire to not have the responsibility of a relationship.   Love without love.    Really, if I am honest with myself the other two relationships were much the same way, simply variations on the same sad, confused, and tragic melody.  I needed remedy, a placebo of distraction, loved and held sacred for their offerings, a chance to give back in part what was taken so much in whole.  A melody played as a form of distraction, a way to occupy my time while I sat in the waiting room of the love that my ex-promised to return back to me some day.  I am still waiting and I am tired.  The doctor hasn't seen me.  The lights to the clinic have shut off and all of the receptionists have gone home for the evening, back to their loved ones.  I have a sickness in my love.  And now it is the next day and I want to return back to the doctor, sit again and wait in the clinic, entertain myself with all of the magazines I have already read and pretend that the news that they contain is still news, even though I know it is not.  And so I tell myself that I will not return to that clinic, to that waiting room, Salle D'attendant (John Fowles' "The Magus"), even though there is still a sickness in my love.  And I am lonely and bitter at the doctor for not having rescheduled the appointment.  For not promising me again that which is 'to come'.  There is still a sickness in my love, but there is no doctor.  What precipitated it was a discussion with my best friend last night, who ironically lives with my ex, just a few blocks from me.  She having moved here to be with me, only not to be.  And then to go to school.  A situation pushed for by me, by both of us, as a form of new beginning for each of us.  He having moved here to be with us and to start a band.  And I asked him if the wishes that he had made upon the threshold of his 'to come' here, his moving here, moving is always a crossing of thresholds, a wishing for new horizons in the ‘to come’.  And I asked him if he had gotten his wishes in the almost two years (two years for me in the next few weeks) since we had moved here, to this horrible and lonely place.  He said he had, that his wishes had come true, that which for him was 'to come' did, the 'to come' arrived, is arriving.  But for me the 'to come' has not appeared.  Empty wishes.  Wishes unfulfilled.  My wishes were to get back together with my ex (we had promised each other we would, after we broke up).  And to get into graduate school.  So far neither has happened.  My ex and I don't talk anymore and I am not even allowed over to their (her's and his and another’s) house, a few blocks from me.  My intense efforts to get into school here were shot down, twice, although probably with good reason.  This isn’t the school for me, their views and my views are antithetical and there is little left for me to learn here that I haven’t already.  So now my happiness lies in moving away again this summer.  To crossing a new threshold and finding a new 'to come'.  But my wishes from this time, this time, never came, and so there is no 'to come' left.  When I move away to graduate school in the fall it will simply have been the delay, the waiting of the 'to come', that was meant for here.  I will be happier, I am happier already, but I am left tired and empty and needing a new adventure, a new love, a new lover, because the ones I wished for here never came.  It is the double cancellation of the ‘to come’, the ‘to come’ with no possibility of arrival, the way in which the negation is negated by its negation and leaves void, lordship and bondage.  It is a ‘to come’ without purpose.  But my loneliness is loneliness and not sadness; there is no sorrow in this dwelling.  It is loneliness, it is bitterness, it is a waiting emptiness, but it is not sad.     backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        She says to me last night, amid the noise, amid the clatter, amid the comfortable discomfort: "I think you're the smartest person here...You're probably smarter than all of us combined"  The absolute unbridled shock of this sincere compliment hits me, I cannot turn it away, as much as I would like to,  I cannot reject a statement of such magnitutde, deny its acceptance, or not allow it to penetrate me, as if someone had said to me "I love you.  You are the greatest person to have ever been loved."    Yet the complete incomprehensibility of this simple statement to me, a gift of unbelievable maginitude, something to me which means so very much, something which I very much need, coming from someone who by nature must at the same time offer up their own humility, must in someway supplicate themselves before their own very statement in order to give a gift so incredible.  I can't possibly know or understand what she means, and as if to recognize the very recognition of the utter freedom of her statement, without desire, without sought of reward, simply to say, simply "You are", she follows up by saying to me:  "I think I'm pretty smart, but I know you are smarter than I am."  And this gift, this terrifying recognition, this statement by the other before me, not to me, but interiorized within myself from outside, from the other, is on a level that is secluded and absolutely alien to me.  I cannot possible understand what she means.  "Thank you," I say, "I don't understand what that means.  I can't possibly understand what you mean by that, but I can only accept and say thank you.  Sincerely.  Thank you."  And yet the absolute alien nature of this speaking, of this recognition, this uninvited gift, unrequested, passed from one person to another in a crowded bar on a flight of stairs, is incomprehensible to me, as if the very stating of this statement, the giving of this gift is impossible, the impossible exchange, not simply because I cannot repay her, I cannot give her a gift of equal or greater gratitude, but because my very incomprehension of the gift denies its right of acceptance.  She has told me how smart I am and yet I am incapable of understanding what that statement means.  "Thank you, and I accept, I don't know why, but I have to.  Thank you.  But you must understand, I must tell you, I still get fucked over.  It does me little good (this gift, my so-called intelligence) because I still get fucked-over."  "I still get fucked over by other people."    The statement is not so much a refusal, but a statement of fact.   It has happened, continues to happen, there is no past perfect for it.  "But we all do, we all get fucked over.  You're smart, that's important.  That means something."  "Does it?  What good does is it do me if I still get fucked over (I am thinking of someone specific here)?"  "Because they can't take that away from you..."  Thank you. Thank you so much for telling me what I needed to hear.  Today, at a coffee shop I pass her, another her, a different her, she whom I had been thinking of, earlier, even now, recently... ...and I wonder again about how very intelligent I must be.  Obviously not enough to not get fucked-over by someone... {perhaps but not excluded to this very person whom I have passed in a coffee shop, recognition without recognition}  ...I'm not half as smart as I need to be.

Words of strength and care and sympathy I opened doors that would have blocked Their way I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay I ravaged at my finance just for Those Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility Those who said a new world, new ways ever free Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me  I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess Because of you I need to rest, oh yes Because it's you that sets the test  So much has gone and little is new And as the sunrise stream Flickers on me, My friends talk Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word  "We had a friend, a talking man Who spoke of many powers he had Not of the best of men, but Ours We used him We let him use his powers We let him fill Our needs Now We are strong  And the road is coming to its end Now the damned have no time to make amends No purse of token fortune stands in Our way The silent guns of love will blast the sky  We broke the ruptured structure built of age Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage Where money stood We planted seeds of rebirth And stabbed the backs of fathers Sons of dirt  Infiltrated business cesspools Hating through Our sleeves Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat Stoned the poor on slogans such as  Wish You Could Hear Love Is All We Need Kick Out The Jams Kick Out Your Mother Cut Up Your Friend Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End  And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above And We Can Force You to Be Free And We Can Force You to Believe  And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain It said  I believe in the Power of Good I Believe in the State of Love I Will Fight For the Right to be Right I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right  And I open my eyes to look around And I see a child laid slain on the ground As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command But not hearing anymore Not hearing anymore Just the shrieks from the old rich  And I Want to Believe In the madness that calls now And I want to Believe That a light's shining through Somehow  And I Want to Believe And You Want to Believe And We Want to Believe And We Want to Live Oh, We Want to Live  We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live  I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live  -David Bowie    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        'As soon as there is the one, there is murder, wounding, traumatism. The one guards against the other, it protects itself from the other. But in the movement of this jealous violence it compromises in itself its self-otherness or self difference. The difference from within one's self, which makes it one. The one as the other. At one and the same time, but in the same time that is out of joint. The one forgets to remember itself to its self. It keeps and erases the archive of this injustice that it is, of this violence that it does. The one makes itself violence, it violates and does violence to itself. It becomes what it is, the very violence that it does to itself. The determination of the self as one is violence.'

        In general, I try and distinguish between what one calls the Future and “l’avenir”  [the ‘to come].  The future is that which – tomorrow, later, next century – will be. There is a future which is predictable, programmed, scheduled, foreseeable.  But there is a future, l’avenir (to come) which refers to someone who comes whose arrival is totally unexpected.  For me, that is the real future.  That which is totally unpredictable.  The Other who comes without my being able to anticipate their arrival.  So if there is a real future, beyond the other known future, it is l’avenir in that it is the coming of the Other when I am completely unable to foresee their arrival.  {transcribed 28.03.04}  -Jacques Derrida, The Future/L'avenir, from "Derrida: The Movie"    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        She says to me as we are laying in bed together, almost for the first time: "I've had a desire for you for a long time now..." The words seem foreign to me, with an incomperable weight,  like snowflakes in a storm. I stroke her face with a tenderness that surprises me,  she looks back at me with the eyes of lover's, I tell her that I didn't expect her to act like a lover,  she tells me that's exactly what she had hoped from me, she tells me it makes her happy that that's the way I am.  Tonight, standing alone in the back, watching the stage, a giant red flag hiding me against the wall and I find myself.  My desire, my passion.  Absent and distant. Finally my desire is free.  In the little conversations that we have between ourselves, a part of me says: "She may be a decent philosopher, but she's hardly a decent human being." Finally I have my freedom.  Finally my desire is gone.    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        An exchange occurs.  Uninvited, without foreknowledge or expectation.  From a distance someone is seen without acknowledgement.  2 years of binary holism, but no message has been sent.  A silent and dead star. My own fear cripples me and I struggle to not be a coward in the face of my Self.  [I am teaching a course on  urlLink the concept of destiny .]  A name is called out. Again, again, again.  In place of a name I wanted to shout out: [-- pompous and verbose, now caustic, now ironic--]  "Hey Cheater"  The thought had occurred to me, later, to shout out:      "Hey Liar"  "Hey Coward!"  But of course I would have to implicate myself in that call, a call made both to the other and to myself, yet for neither; both true from both of our perspectives.  Instead I call out to a name that is foreign to me, a name which I know now better as a name than a person, a name which I have known, once, only as a person, a name which at one time I may have replaced by calling out instead,  "Hey babe" "Hey love"  But, I say none of these things, instead.  Overcome with fear of my cowardice I can only say: "How are you? How are you feeling? Better?"  "Yeah" is the responce, then quickly hidden again.  The overwhelming desire to have called out those things, both good and bad, would, as was pointed out to me, have lasted 15 seconds, and then remorse, the overwhelming feeling that I would have been an absolute asshole for saying them, any of them, and I would have deserved it.  Instead I looked off in silence, trying to negate my recognition, to make my presence more comfortable, for one or the both of us, I'm not sure.    But the humor of the situation never escaped me and I never stopped smiling.  Two years of time spent together for less than two minutes of sad and pathetic fear.  The irony can still only make me laugh.  The Uninvited Guest and the Right of Invitation.    backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        "At last the horizon appears free again to us, even granted that its not bright, at last our ships may venture out again… the sea, our sea lies open again; perhaps there has never been such an open sea"   -Friedrich Nietzsche,  The Gay Science  ____________________________________________  One of the joys of the postmodern, but paradoxically at the same instant one of the more taxing modes to overcome, is that of the very textuality of the work (3). The most obvious operative of intertextuality as a tool and indeed a plot device is Italo Calvino. His If on a winter’s night a traveller ends:  ‘"…Aren’t you tired of reading?"  And you say, "Just a moment, I’ve almost finished If on a winter’s night a traveller by Italo Calvino." (4)’  The work of Calvino like the work of many postmodernists is built on layers; it is these layers, often built to dizzying (and tiring) effect, that help to blur the barriers that modernism wished to efface. Calvino’s text, by creating a world in which he himself is a character, as is the reader reading, becomes a construct and now rather than pointing out the differences between fictional readers/authors and their real counterparts the "duplication is sufficient to render both artificial" (5) and the ‘horizon’ blurs into its surroundings. Jean Baudrillard saw this shift from production to reproduction vital to postmodernity; simulations / models and signs cease to reflect the world but actually become the world or as he preferred to phrase it the hyperreal. In The Ecstasy of Communication Baudrillard takes Nietzsche’s ‘horizon’ to its logical conclusion;  "If it were no longer a question of setting truth against illusion, but of perceiving the prevalent illusion as truer than truth?… If there were no more fractures, no more vanishing lines, no more lines of rupture, but only a surface that is full and continuous, surface without depth, without interruption?"

        The mode of my presence in the world is the subject in so far as by reducing itself solely to this certainty of being a subject, it becomes active annihilation.  In fact, the process of the philosophical meditation throws the subject towards the transforming historical action, and around this point, orders the configured modes of active self-consciousness through its metamorphosis in history.  As for the meditation on being that reaches its culmination in the thought of Heidegger, it restores to being itself the power of annihilation - or at least poses the question of how it may be related to it.  ...in order to propose a return to the sources of intuition concerning the visible and invisible, to come back to that which is prior to all reflection, thetic or non-thetic, in order to locate the emergence of vision itself.  For him [Merleau-Ponty], it is a question of restoring - for, he tells us, it can only be a question of reconstruction or a restoration, not of a path traversed in the opposite direction - of reconstituting the way by which, not from the body, but from something that he calls the flesh of the world, the original point of vision was able to emerge.  It would seem that in in this way one sees, in this unfinished work, the emergence of something like the search for an unnamed substance from which I, the seer, extract myself.  From the toils ( rets ), or rays ( rais ), if you prefer, of an iridescence of which I am at first a part, I emerge as eye, assuming, in a way, emergence from what I would like to call the function of  seeingness  ( voyure ).  -Jacques Lacan, Seminar XI: " Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis "

         'The very condition of a deconstruction may be at work in the work, within the system to be deconstructed. It may already be located there, already at work. Not at the center, but in an eccentric center, in a corner whose eccentricity assures the solid concentration of the system, participating in the construction of what it, at the same time, threatens to deconstruct. One might then be inclined to reach this conclusion: deconstruction is not an operation that supervenes afterwards, from the outside, one fine day. It is always already at work in the work. Since the destructive force of Deconstruction is always already contained within the very architecture of the work, all one would finally have to do to be able to deconstruct, given this always already, is to do memory work. Yet since I want neither to accept nor to reject a conclusion formulated in precisely these terms, let us leave this question suspended for the moment.'  -Jacques Derrida, "Memoires for Paul DeMan"     backBlog('100503','Apotropos')   urlLink Feedback

        § 58. Anrufverstehen und Schuld  Um das im Anrufverstehen Gehörte phänomenal zu fassen, gilt es, erneut auf den Anruf zuruckzügehen.  Das Anrufen des Man-selbst bedeutet Aufrufen des eigensten Selbst zu seinem Seinkönnen und zwar als Dasein, das heißt besorgendes In-der-Welt-sein und Mit-sein mit Anderen.  Die existenziale Interpretation dessen, wozu der Ruf aufruft, kann daher, sofern sie sich in ihren methodischen Möglichkeiten und Aufgaben recht versteht, keine konkrete einzelne Existenzmöglichkeit umgrenzen wollen.  Nicht das je existenziell im jeweiligen Dasein in dieses Gerufene kann und will fixiert werden, sondern das, was zur existenzialen Bedingung der Möglichkeit des je faktisch-existenziellen Seinkönnens gehört.	  [M. Heidegger. «Sein und Zeit»] ________________________________________________________________________ §58. Understanding the Summons, and Guilt  In order to grasp phenomenally what is heard in understanding the summons, we shall take up this summons anew.   Summoning the they-self means calling forth the authentic self to its potentiality-of-being, as Dasein, that is, being-in-the-world taking care of things and being-with others.  The existential interpretation of that to which the call calls forth, thus cannot define any concrete individual possibility of existence if it understands itself correctly in its methodical possibilities and tasks.  What can be established, and what seeks to get established, is not what is called in and to each particular Dasein from an existentiell standpoint, but what belongs to the existential condition of the possibility of the actual, factical and existentiell potentiality-of-being.

        'That philosophy died yesterday, since Hegel or Marx, Nietzsche, or Heidegger, and that philosophy should still wander toward the meaning of its death, or that it has always lived knowing itself to be dying; that philosophy died one day, within history, or that it has always fed on its own agony, on the violent way it opens history by opposing itself to nonphilosophy, which is its past and its concern, its death and wellspring; that beyond the death, or dying nature of philosophy, perhaps even because of it, thought still has a future, or even, as is said today, is still entirely to come because of what philosophy has held in store; or more strangely still, that the future itself has a future all these are unanswerable questions.

       The Death of the Other (and my own)...  Recently the good friend of an adopted family member was taken off of life support. This is for her, for him, and for Seth. __________________________________________________________________________   There is nothing I can say that could possibly console you.  The only gift  that I could possibly give you would be the gift of silence and of presence.  When my best friend was taken off life support last year I slowly watched  the light from his dim eyes fade away...I still have my own nightmares about walking the hospital halls and the confusion and horror of the days before  and the days after.  But soon the light that had faded from his mortal body began to dance in my  dreams or in my mind's eye, and I would find that I would walk down the  street and sense him next to me, talking in the same way as he always did,  or that I would wake up in the morning and he would make some insipid  comment (like he always did), like "Its about time you got up!".  I  occasionally hear his voice when I read back through my own writing (he was  a writer), or when I am talking with a pretty girl (he was an amazing  flirt).  No one else can understand your lose, and you will never recover  from it.  But what you will do is learn to carry him with you, to talk to  him and recognize when he is around you.  You will learn that the little  things that you do to honor his memory are not empty because he will respond to them.  And that in more ways than you can know right now he is with you  always, in ways more beautiful than he could have ever been while he lived  in his mortal body.  But you know all of this already.  As you go through your days look for him around you, and thank him for  choosing to stay with you.  I have a feeling you may be surprised at the  answers.

      If I speak in the tongues of men and angels,  but have not love,  I have become sounding brass or a tinkling symbol.   And if I have prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge,  and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains,  but have not love, I am nothing.   And if I dole out all my goods, and  if I deliver my body that I may boast  but have not love, nothing I am profited.  Love is long suffering,  love is kind,  it is not jealous,  love does not boast,  it is not inflated.  It is not discourteous,  it is not selfish,  it is not irritable,  it does not enumerate the evil. It does not rejoice over the wrong, but rejoices in the truth      It covers all things,  it has faith for all things,  it hopes in all things,  it endures in all things.  Love never falls in ruins;  but whether prophecies, they will be abolished; or  tongues, they will cease; or  knowledge, it will be superseded.  For we know in part and we prophecy in part.  But when the perfect comes, the imperfect will be superseded.    When I was an infant,  I spoke as an infant,  I reckoned as an infant;  when I became a man,  I abolished the things of the infant.   For now we see through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know as also I was fully known.   But now remains faith, hope, love,  these three; but the greatest of these is love.   1 Corinthians 13:1-13   ____________________________________________________________  Then said Almitra, "Speak to us of Love."    And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said: When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.     For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.     All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.   But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.   Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love.   When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, "I am in the heart of God." And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.   Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; To return home at eventide with gratitude; And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.    Then Almitra spoke again and said, "And what of Marriage, master?"    And he answered saying: You were born together, and together you shall be for evermore. You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days. Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God. But let there be spaces in your togetherness. And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.   Love one another, but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.   Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.   Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.    THE PROPHET - Kahlil Gibran

         WILLARD : "And what would his people back home want if they ever learned just how far from them he'd really gone? He broke from them and then he broke from himself. I'd never seen a man so broken up, ripped apart..."   " I've seen horrors...horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that...But you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is  necessary to those who do not know what horror means.  Horror. Horror has a face...And you must make a friend of horror. Horror and  moral terror are your friends. If they are not then they are enemies to be feared.  They are truly enemies..."        - Col. Kurtz ,  Apocalypse Now    "We are the hollow men We are the stuffed men Leaning together Headpiece filled with straw. Alas! Our dried voices, when We whisper together Are quiet and meaningless As wind in dry grass Or rats' feet over broken glass In our dry cellar Shape without form, shade without colour, Paralysed force, gesture without motion;"    T.S.

        I.01 -  for her .  -Quite a long time ago, that, put in different words, would have resembled for me a terrifying children's game, unforgettable overthere, interminable.  I have left it behind overthere; I shall tell you about it one day.  Its living voice has grown husky, a very young voice, but it is not dead.  It is not an evil.  I have the feeling that, if it is given back to me one day, I shall then see, for the first time in reality, as a prisoner of the cave does after death, the truth of what I have lived:  the truth itself  beyond memory, as the hidden other side of shadows, of images, of images of images, and of phantasms that have filled each moment of my life.  I am not talking about the brevity of a recorded film that one could see again (life will have been so short) but of the very thing itself.  Beyond memory and time lost.  I am not even speaking of an ultimate unveiling, but of what will have remained alien, for all time, to the veiled figure, to the very figure of the veil.  This desire and promise let all my spectres loose.  A desire without a horizon, for this is its luck or its condition.  And a promise that no longer expects what it waits for: there where, striving for what is given to come [ l'avenir ], I finally know how not to have to distinguish any longer between promise and terror.  Jacques Derrida,  Monolingualism of the Other; or, The Prosthesis of Origin     We must begin then, as we have so much already, to speak of the unspeakable. To speak of the moment of the event in its own very process, that is, we must speak of the process of the event in its unspeakability.  We must, if we may try, through perhaps a welter of words, to speak of that very event for its reappropriation, the narcissistic reappropriation that takes place in the other, or perhaps better put, with the other, over and across the other, echoing back to our very own.    That is, we must situate ourselves outside of ourselves, perhaps in the Other, perhaps not, maybe even in the very other to whom the event as a process is bound; but this situating is not a gift for the Other only in so far as it is for the self and perhaps coming from or with the Other.  That is, the situating which we do is wholly our own, situated within the very condition of the other as Other, as the they.    This situating is not their situating, it is not the being situated of the they, or of the other, but of the very self over and across the other, as the future, as that which is to come.  It is then the ghost, the haunting spectre, of the very hospitality of the self, located over and across the other as the they, and perhaps, eventually to come, the other as being alongside an other, but not located within the very other as self.  We are to speak then of ghosts, and gifts, and hospitality, all three related like family in our tracing of the event, in the movement across language and philosophy, and perhaps, maybe, back to the very self.  But mostly here, we will speak, if any speaking can be said to ever occur, about calling.    We must refer then to the very name of the event.

        Living with Liz Phair (Track 10  Exile in Guyville :)  ...I will surprise you sometime, I'll come around... -Obstacle 1.    At the end of three days, moving southward, you come upon Anastasia, a city with concentric canals watering it and kites flying over it. I should now list the wares that can profitably be bought here: agate, onyx, chrysoprase, and other varieties of chalcedony; I should praise the flesh of the golden pheasant cooked here over fires of seasoned chery wood and sprinkled with much sweet marjoram; and tell of the women I have seen bathing in the pool of a garden and who sometimes - it is said - invite the stranger to disrobe with them and chase them in the water. But with all this, I would not be telling you the city's true essence; for while the description of Anastasia awakens desires one at a time only to force you to stifle them, when you are in the heart of Anastasia one morning your desires waken all at once and surround you. The city appears to you as a whole where no desire is lost and of which you are a part, and since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing but inhabit this desire and be content. Such is the power, sometimes called malignant, sometimes benign, that Anastasia, the treacherous city, possesses; if for eight hours a day you work as a cutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labor which gives form to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave.

       L'amour d'Écho et de Narcisse˚    " Wo Es war, soll Ich werde -"   So it is that we must seek a movement of narcissistic reappropriation.  That is, in our seeking, we must ask, ask a question in silence, about the very movement of our reappropriation.  That is, we must seek in our relation to the other,  as other , about this very movement, about the movement of reappropriation.  But the question that is being asked, the question that is presented before us, that is, the event.  It is the event which we wish to reappropriate in our relation to the other.  No, it is not the event itself, not the happening of the event perhaps, but instead, maybe, the very relation of ourselves  in  the event.  That is we wish to reappropriate ourselves narcissistically from the event, contained within the happening of the event, reappropriating ourselves in and within the other, and perhaps even the other, within the very context of this event, the shortest shadow of this happening.   There is not narcissism and non-narcissism. There are narcissisms that are more or less comprehensive, generous, open, extended. What is called non-narcissism is in general but the economy of a much more welcoming and hospitable narcissism. One that is much more open to the experience of the Other as Other. I believe that without a movement of narcissistic reappropriation, the relation to the Other would be absolutely destroyed, it would be destroyed in advance. The relation to the Other, even if it remains asymmetrical, open, without possible reappropriation, must trace a movement of reappropriation in the image of one's self for love to be possible. Love is narcissistic.   /s/ Jacques Derrida, "There Is No  One  Narcissism," Points... Interviews, 1974 - 1994 , pp. 199.     That is, in our experience of the event as happening, perhaps even as trauma, as wounding even, the very self encounter which we are here seeking, now, after the fact, after the very fact of this event, yet still contained, construed anyway - still constituted within this very happening, as real, as an encounter.  As self-encounter.  And yet what we seek here most, outside the event, after its very happening, and certainly perhaps always before, absolutely before, before even the very possibility of this, that is this very, this singular (and perhaps even abstractly) event, is its reappropriation.  Its self appropriation within, as, encounter.  That is, in the economy of this pleasure, the event, this trauma, perhaps even this wounding, after the fact.  This self encounter in the real, neccesitates its own narcissictic reappropriation of the other as other within the event after its very occuring.  And yet.  Always the 'as yet'.  There is the unspeakability of the event as event.  The undesireability to reduce the discourse of the event to mere discourse.  To mere speech.  That is, the desire to remain silent in the experience of the event as real, as trauma, as perhaps even wounding. (And perhaps even as narcissistic reappropriation of the other as other)  [ she hates yellow ]  Yet can this narcissistic reappropriation ever occur outside of discourse?  (Despite the undesireability to speak of this event, as event).  That is to say: here is the experience of an event, an event that in its occurring occurs as real, as trauma, and perhaps even as wounding, an event in which there occurs, in its occurrence as real, an encounter with the self in the occurrenceas event.  Yet a desire is maintained, is given, across in-itself, to remain silent before and around ( about ) this very event.  That is, the self issues outward and across the very desireability of maintaining the self as silence within the very experience of the event in order to maintain the very self-encountering that occurs in this event which in itself must remain silent.  That is, in order for the experience of this event as the experience of self-encountering within the event we must maintain a sense of silence even with-in our own selves.  Yet there remains an equal desire to break the silence of the event, this event, in order to reappropriate it narcissistically - that is to have the very experience of the reappropriation of the self in this event as relation to the other as other in which the event must be spoken of, echoes, and be reappropriated as event without the violation of the event, the other, or the very self that is being broken in its own very silence in its reappropriation.  What should be said then, what can even be said, in the very silence of this event?  That is to say: if we are to speak of this event, and it is always (perhaps always-already) this very event, in its particular, if we are to discover some space in this, its, silence, some possibility of this reappropriation, an echo of ourselves in our blind narcissism  before  the reappropriation within the very happening of the event, we must uncover the very space which allows the desire for reappropriation to hide in the very silence, a silence which too is always-already my own, and perhaps, in this reappropriation that of the other regarded as other in their relation to both themself and their own experience of the event, to occur.    And while in the space of this very silence, in the narcissitic desire of my own self reappropriation weighed, perhaps, maybe, inappropriately with reference to a general economy of pleasure ( jouissance  - already inappropriate here), we must discover the edge, that is, speak around this very silent space between the event on the one hand, and the "declaration of the event" on the other.  We shall seek to uncover then something about the character of this event, not as particular sequential occurrences bound within an external framework constituted without mediation, but rather as the clearing of space within the properizing kairological becoming of time as moment.  Yet this becoming of time as moment is decidely not an external passage of transgression, and no such transfiguration could either be constituted or said to occur.  And if we are to speak of such externalities, as perhaps in our relation, that is, our recognition, of the other as other, and the subsequent reappropriation of our-selves within both the event and the other as declaration of the event, then we must at some point, later, and perhaps always and discontinuously, meet the other in this clearing.  For in our encounter within the event, within the space of silence, and the desire of reappropriation it is not simple enough for us to schematize the temporal, kairological, character of our self encounter as subject-event-subject.  That is, we cannot merely reduce the subject of the event in its self encountering, in its self discoverdness after the event, that is "this place [that] is subjectivized exclusively in a retroactive manner, after the event".* Yet, the very constitutionality of this event as moment must and can only occur prior to the moment as historicity, as the very futurizing of the past found within the self priorizing that is the becoming of time as self.  Thus within the movement of the moment as the very space of the event in which this transgression of narcissistic reappropriation within the recognition of the other as other encounters both disclosedness of the self in its self reappropriation while encountering the other as other as discovered with the space (and time, as moment, as an 'eye-blink') that is, both retroactively and discontinously the event.   Yet we may say here metaelliptically, that is, tracing the course of the ellipsis over and across itself, in both its bracket and its trace, from one boundary line across and through the other, overlapping from one edge to the other, about the "end(s)" of the event,...  One does not,  at the end , become what one is. If one can talk about an "end" here, it is an end that takes place in  the middle .  The "end" is not conclusive but inaugural; it inaugurates the very split that leads to it.  The "end" is nothing other than the joint or hinge of the two ends that seem to point in opposite directions.* (em. added)  The initial experience of the event encounters the self in its recognition of the other as other in the event, yet, in order for the narcissistic reappropriation of the self within the recognition of other as other to take place the event, as event, in both its presence and absence [pres-ab-scence], both retroactively and dis-continuously, as the possibility of prioritization as reappropriation to occur the event must re-occur, reconstitute the self in its past as futurization, and encounter closure ( cloture ), that is,  the experience of the event as reappropriation .   *Alenka Zupancˇicˇ,  The Shortest Shadow : Nietzsche's Philosophy of the Two.

         Stairs to nowhere climb I take them, all the time Crawling on my knees Walking that old fine line  And when I'm alone and scared I think of little rhymes They would make no sense to you But I make them all the time  And time's all mine And time's all mine  It's the little pills you find Crushed to dust, rolling out of sight They end up in the strangest places But I take them all the time  And time's all mine And time's all mine  When everyone is false I tell them I'm just fine I can't remember their names But I fake them all the time  And time's all mine And time's all mine  And when I'm alone and scared I think of little rhymes They would make no sense to you But I make them all the time   Mercury Rev , " Little Rhymes "

        “ Hymn to Nemesis . Thee, Nemesis, I call, almighty queen, by whom the deeds of mortal life are seen: eternal, much revered, of boundless sight, alone rejoicing in the just and right: changing the counsels of the human breast for ever various, rolling without rest. To every mortal is thy influence known, and men beneath thy righteous bondage groan; for every thought within the mind concealed is to thy sight perspicuously revealed. The soul unwilling reason to obey, by lawless passion ruled, thine eyes survey. All to see, hear, and rule, O power divine, whose nature equity contains, is thine. Come, blessed, holy Goddess, hear my prayer, and make thy mystics’ life thy constant care: give aid benignant in the needful hour, and strength abundant to the reasoning power; and far avert the dire, unfriendly race of counsels impious, arrogant, and base.”   – Orphic Hymn 61 to  Nemesis

        Violence to the truth.  Violence to the trust of the truth; the fidelity of the one to the other.  The trust ( triuwe ) of the truth ( troth ) that is the bond of the one in relation to the other.  Not the absolute other, perhaps, ( one fine day ) even standing in and swearing on behalf of the absolute, as other.  As the signifier of the other.  What kind of violence can bare witness, accuse, standing in front of the truth of the other?  Perhaps even the violence of the transgression of the truth, the bond, as relating the one to, even  with , the other.  What is the violation of the truth of the other? Of the one? Of the violence upon, over, of the truth of the one to the other? The other to the one? The one with ( without? ) the other?  The violence of the infidel-ity of the truth ( troth )?  The infidelity of the other to the one?  It is a violence - that is a violence first and foremost to the self (as either one or other), the one that is being violent in the transgression of the unfaithful ( infidelis ), but this violence is so much less than the violence of the loss of the other. Such that, if the act of infidelity leads to separation (of the truth? troth?) it is a violation that is more extreme to both the one and the other, certainly of the relation of the one with the other, to their love, to each  other , than the initial act of transgression.  This distancing, this concealment, and most especially this loosening of the truth, of this bond tying the one and the other together, is followed by, or more perhaps, always-already perpetuated by, a sense of always being-there, present, for the other, the right of refusal to end the relation because of the transgressive act.  The act of forgiveness then, the reappropriation of the truth of the bond, that is, the seeking of forgiveness before the one and the other, as self, must happen, must occur as event, that the transgression must be reabsorbed, rewritten into the story and fabric of the destiny of the relation of the one to the other.  That the relationship cannot continue, ever, except perhaps as perpendicular lines, if there is never the supplication, the sublimation, of forgiveness of the one before itself and the other.  The one of the self,  in  the other.  Otherwise this transgression remains as a wound, a growing cancer, an amorous cancer of transgression, that is, a cancer named after and for the invisible name of the one who was transgressed upon, that is, the sexual object of replacement by the unfaithful.  That is, I have a wound in my love, which is named for the invisible name, or perhaps the name which has no face to me, of the man with whom my lover cheated on me with, this wound of my love which can only be attended upon, removed, unnamed and erased, from my very self by my other, by my lover.  Otherwise I carry his name within me as a wound in my love forever, and all of our future loving must include the three of us, even in his absence.

         Zwischen Raubvögeln  Wer hier hinabwill, wie schnell schluckt den die Tiefe! —Aber du, Zarathustra, liebst den Abgrund noch, thust der Tanne es gleich?—  Die schlägt Wurzeln, wo der Fels selbst schaudernd zur Tiefe blickt—, die zögert an Abgründen, wo Alles rings hinunter will: zwischen der Ungeduld wilden Gerölls, stürzenden Bachs geduldig duldend, hart, schweigsam, einsam ...  Einsam! Wer wagte es auch, hier Gast zu sein, dir Gast zu sein? ...  Ein Raubvogel vielleicht: der hängt sich wohl dem standhaften Dulder schadenfroh in's Haar, mit irrem Gelächter, einem Raubvogel-Gelächter ...  Wozu so standhaft? —höhnt er grausam: man muss Flügel haben, wenn man den Abgrund liebt ... man muss nicht hängen bleiben, wie du, Gehängter!—  Oh Zarathustra, grausamster Nimrod! jüngst Jäger noch Gottes, das Fangnetz aller Tugend, der Pfeil des Bösen! Jetzt— von dir selber erjagt, deine eigene Beute, in dich selber eingebohrt ...  Jetzt— einsam mit dir, zwiesam im eignen Wissen, zwischen hundert Spiegeln vor dir selber falsch, zwischen hundert Erinnerungen ungewiss, an jeder Wunde müd, an jedem Froste kalt, in eignen Stricken gewürgt, Selbstkenner! Selbsthenker!  Was bandest du dich mit dem Strick deiner Weisheit? Was locktest du dich ins , Paradies der alten Schlange? Was schlichst du dich ein in dich—in dich? ...  Ein Kranker nun, der an Schlangengift krank ist; ein Gefangner nun, der das härteste Loos zog: im eignen Schachte gebückt arbeitend, in dich selber eingehöhlt, dich selber angrabend, unbehülflich, steif, ein Leichnam—, von hundert Lasten überthürmt, von dir überlastet, ein Wissender! ein Selbsterkenner! der weise Zarathustra! ...  Du suchtest die schwerste Last: da fandest du dich—, du wirfst dich nicht ab von dir ...  Lauernd, kauernd, Einer, der schon nicht mehr aufrecht steht! Du verwächst mir noch mit deinem Grabe, verwachsener Geist! ...  Und jüngst noch so stolz, auf allen Stelzen deines Stolzes! Jüngst noch der Einsiedler ohne Gott, der Zweisiedler mit dem Teufel, der scharlachne Prinz jedes Übermuths! ...  Jetzt— zwischen zwei Nichtse eingekrümmt, ein Fragezeichen, ein müdes Räthsel— ein Räthsel für Raubvögel ...  sie werden dich schon "lösen", sie hungern schon nach deiner "Lösung", sie flattern schon um dich, ihr Räthsel, um dich, Gehenkter! ... Oh Zarathustra! ... Selbstkenner! ... Selbsthenker! ...    Amid Birds of Prey  Whoever tends to descend here, How quickly The depths swallow them! — But you, Zarathustra, Still love the abyss — Do you, just as the spruce?  Its roots shoot down, where The rock itself tremors Gazing into the depths — It tarries at abysses, Where everything around Tends to fall: Amid the impatience Of the rough boulders and torrential streams Patiently enduring, firm, silent, Solitary ...  Solitary! Who would even venture To be a guest here, To be your guest? ...  A bird of prey perhaps: who might well hang, the steadfast patient sufferer, Gloating delightfully in its coat, With mad laughter, A bird of prey's laughter ...  Why so steadfast? — Cruelly, it scoffs: One must have wings, if one loves the abyss ... One must not remain suspended, Like you, hanged one! —  Oh Zarathustra, Cruelest nimrod! Recently still a hunter of God, The snare of all virtue, The arrow of evil! Now — Hunted by yourself, Your own prey, Bored into yourself ...  Now — Alone with yourself, Paired in your own knowledge, Amid a hundred reflections Before your false self, Amid a hundred dubious Memories, Weary from every hurt, Chilled by every frost, Strangled by your own rope, Self-knower! Self-hangman!  Why did you bind yourself With the rope of your wisdom? Why did you seduce yourself Into the paradise of the ancient serpent? Why did you crawl into yourself In you—into you?  An invalid now, One who is sick from snake venom; A prisoner now, One who drew the hardest lot: In your own shaft Laboring bent over, Excavating yourself, Digging into yourself, Without aid, Stiff, A corpse — Overpiled by a hundred burdens, By your overburdens, One in the know! A self-knower! The wise Zarathustra! ...  You sought the heaviest burden Yet found yourself — Cannot cast off yourself from you ...  Lurking, Crouching, One who no longer stands upright! You are deeply rooted in your tomb, Tangled spirit! ...  And yet recently so proud, Upon all your stilted pride! Recently still the godless hermit, The co-settler with the devil, The scarlet prince of all arrogance! ...  Now — Between two voids One who is twisted, A question mark, A weary enigma — An enigma for birds of prey ...  They'll certainly "dissolve" you, They no doubt hunger after your "dissolution," Indeed they flutter about you, their enigma, Around you, hanged man! ... Oh Zarathustra! ... Self-knower! ... Self-hangman! ...   Friedrich Nietzsche, "Thus Spoke Zarathustra"
