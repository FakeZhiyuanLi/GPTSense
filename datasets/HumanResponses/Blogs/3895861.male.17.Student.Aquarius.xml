      i have found some creepy sites recently. and some that made me sick, and some that did both of the above.  www.dolphinsex.org  i thought, at first that that was jsut a simple, innocent site about the simple topic of dolphins mating. That is what it sounds like, right? Well that initial analysis is wrong. It is about ppl having sex with dolphins. yah. intimate desciptions. eeeewwwwwww.  I have spent alot of time, since my last post, tho not nemore, at the following site:  www.johntitor.com  that is an interesting site, lemme tell ya. it is about this guy (if it is real, it is a guy) who says he is from the future. He says he is from the year 2036. He cruised some forums, and largely ppl sed he was dumb or asked him for stock tips/sports scores/near-future news. He dint tell ne of that. He sed he dint remember soem of it, but also he sed that it would be immoral to tell some stuff that ppl could makemoney on, i suppose that is right. Some just asked him for the big stuff. The big stuff he talks aboot is the civil war that is supposed to start this year/next. it will turn into WWIII not long later. I hope he's wrong, but I can't say I'd be terribly surprised if he is right. There are pics of his time machine and stuff. It is a very cool site, whether it real (prolly not) or fake (prolly is).   This site is not terribly bizarre, but i still want u to go there. It is pure art.  www.lodger.tv  It is a fun little site. They have flash videos of a kind I have not seen before. The ppl are kind of like stick figures, but they are better described as the ppl from public signs (liek the ones in the wheelchair spaces in parking lots everywhere). The main characters are male almost (if not, then totally) exclusively male. This makes them of much gr8er impact to a male audience, if u ask me, but I think females would enjoy the site, too. The best stuff on the site is the videos, I LOVE DEATH is my favorite--it is awesome. Half (two) of the vids are for selling something, but they are still good. Play the game, there are stick figures giving head in it.  NEXT! I had the brilliant idea (which I stole from jen borg) of talking to myself on AIM. All you have to do is add your own s/n to yer buddylist. Then all u do is waste a huge corporation's bandwidth. this is fun, but i have recently found something even more fun. If u add ZolaOnAOL and/or SmarterChild, (there are others, but those r my favorites) then u ken talk to a computer which is programmed to respond to u as tho it were a (somewhat conservative) person. It is fun to pass some time with it.  tuoderredout: are you gay? SmarterChild: Why do you care? tuoderredout: I want to know if you're gay. SmarterChild: Tell me more. tuoderredout: Do you type with a lisp? SmarterChild: Sure. I guess.  The fun goes on forever.  tuoderredout: hello ZolaOnAOL: Hi again! Got any weekend plans? tuoderredout: I plan to wank. ZolaOnAOL: Do you think that this plan will succeed? tuoderredout: Yes! ZolaOnAOL: "Do you think that this plan will succeed"? Yes? tuoderredout: yes ZolaOnAOL: Is there an echo in here? tuoderredout: no ZolaOnAOL: Good you stopped repeating me. tuoderredout: indeed ZolaOnAOL: Indeed it is so. tuoderredout: yes ZolaOnAOL: Next question? tuoderredout: How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood? ZolaOnAOL: A whole forest.  I found something similar on www.bored.com once. I can't remember the name of the bot. It was fun, tho.  http://www.dancingbush.com/  Make Dubya dance. The site is really kind of boring. It jsut made me think. I thought for a second that it may have taken a little time to find an acceptable body for G Dub on that flash. Then it hit me. All white ppl look the same. especially politicians, b/c they all dress the same (not cheap, but also not expensive suit, blue or red tie). That also got me thinking about this one guy form the NAACP who sed sumtin nasty and racial to Nader (sumtin liek he is jsut another cracker [that is how NAACP ppl say it--cracker not cracka] that wants to tell blacks what to do, he might be right). Which mad eme tihnk aboot how some white ppl say that all blacks look the same. I dunt think so. I think that asians look very similar to each other. I dont expect them to know the difference between a german and an austrian, so i dunt think they should get terribly offended when i dunt know whether they are chinese or japanese. Many also dislike being called "oriental". I dutn understand y, it is not meant to be bad or anything. It is also a term that differentiates them from indian or pakistani ppl. that reminds me of that movie "booty call" where, for most of the movie, two guys are hunting down condoms and shrink-wrap for use on their GFs. A guy beihnd the counter of a conveinience store say "CALL ME A PAKISTANI, WILL YOU?" as he pulls ot a huge shotgun, and his co-worker (also indian). pulls out an automatic. This I understand, India use to be what is now India, plus pakistan, and it use to be owned by Britain, so they were grouped together, same laws and all (Pakistan is mostly muslim, very conservative and india is mostly hindu, where there are sculptures of penises at some streetcorners for worship) for a long time b4 a mutual separation that led to, among other things, years of war between them, and nukes in both countries. Call an Indian a Pak-man, he should be offended. Call A Germ a Pole, he should be offended. Call a Japanese a Korean, it dunt matter. china-japanese confusion, ok that i admit i understand, japan has whopped china's ass so many time it aint funny. Especially when u tihnk aboot the numbers involved here. China= at least 20% of the entire world's population vs. Japan= all the ppl u can fit onto an average-sized island chain.    Can you still say "Put it where the sun don't shine" on a nude beach? I mean seriously, there are no tan lines or nething, so i dunt think there is a place where the sun dunt shine. I would not go to a nude beach. I bet it is all perverts there. Would I fit in? prolly. Would I be happy i fit in with a bunch of naked pervs with binoculars and cameras? noper. I dunt even think I wouldn't even go to euro-peon nude beaches. I thikn it is best that msot ppl are clothed when I see them. That is including the fact that europeans are not as fat as merikens (ppl from merika, where we live, ppl have been calling it that since bush has been slurring it). It isn't really trure that the grils dont shave thier pits, most do. they dunt shower so often, tho. Also, they are more laid back about drinking. In Germany, beer can be drunk (ppl can be drunk, too!) at 16, and harder stuff at 18. also, many euros drink hard liquor b4 they eat dinner. I know for a fact that greeks, italians, and scandinavians do. It happens often enough that Coca-Cola makes a drink that tastes like everclear (a lil' different, more liek ouzo), but is not alcoholic. don't believe me? It's called Beverly. I have had some. The dutch are portrayed as being laid back on some things, liek weed and prostitution (b/c it is legal and regulated there). But really, they are tighter on those things than even the US, which spends billions (with a "b" or a thousand million, a million dollars is the produce of a person's entire life--think about it, they are spending the produce of a person's life thousands of times over) on a FAILING drug war. It is easier to get weed than alcohol, if you are under age, think aboot that. U know it is true if u have had ne. Sometimes, it is even easier than cigs. Holland boasts the fact that 1/3 fewer teens use pot, now that is legal. Now, just as in Nevada of this fine country, they have legal but regulated prostitution. Think aboot that. They got rid of the vast majority or crack babies, crack whores, STD passing, and violence of that situation, while maintaining the sex part (hey! i got to say "sex part"!) as well as making it less expensive. Just to let u know aboot the regulation, there are to be no new permits for pot coffee-houses, a store may have no more than 500g of product, and a single person may buy no more than 25g at a time, and may be in possesion of no more than 40g (a CD weighs 150 grams). In Canada, weed has been decriminalized. That does not mean legal. It just means u dont go to jail for it. U lose yer weed, and u get a ticket. They saw that jailing these ppl for simple possesion does more harm than good. They also discovered that ppl are paranoid aboot the police, not from the weed, weird, huh? I could rant aboot this for a while. I choose not to this time.  If the sky is the limit, then what is space? Is that too much to ask for? I think NASA would disagree. Maybe Dubya would, too. Maybe he just wants to get re-elected. Maybe he wants to get shot and then have a legacy. Either way, Congress has cut the funding for Bush's plan to make a base on the moon, then to use it to make a mission to mars. Maybe somebody from NASA told Bush there was oil on the moon. Then congress called the bluff. Did u kow NASA only got 15 million a year. We dont jsut spend more or cocaine we spend multiples more. The federal gov't funded a N. Carolina study once. It cost $15,000. What did they find out? They found out common reasons why prisoners don't liek jail. WTF? WTF? W...T...F....? They could have given me a five to tell them INTER-RACIAL GAY RAPE, BUBBA WANTS TO DANCE WITH ME, THE FOOD SUX, U KENT GET A G.E.D. NEMORE, MUCH LESS COLLEGE, IT IS PUNISHMENT FOR DOING SUMTIN WRONG!!! WHEN I GO BACK, I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK TO WHAT I WAS DOING B4 JUST TO LIVE ,NOT JUST TO MAKE A LIVING!! DUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH! NOW GIVE ME MY GODDAMN 5$, ASSHOLE. AND QUIT WASTING MY TIME AND MONEY! COCKFACE! 15 mil sounds liek a lot. but u must consider. they are going into outer FUCKING space. Y dunt they stop fighting the drug war and go to mars for the oil. i think they should.   Isn't Disney World just a people trap operated by a mouse? Think about it. Some rich mother fucker thinks he's funny. God thinks he's funny, too, but that is a different rant. I was at Disney World, not terribly long ago. It was a band trip. i dint do ne tripping while i was there, tho. I had some ouzo, tho. It is good. Rich ppl own this country. 98% of the resources are owned be 2% of the populace. They also get taxed the least, on a percentage basis. Think aboot tha for a second. If a rich bastard suddenly lost 25% of his income, does he starve? Fuck no he doesn't. He gets screwed silly by his multiple supermodel GFs while eating deep-fried oreos off of their asses. u should try that some time, it is fun. What if somebody woh makes 12k a year loses 2%? They get eveicted, and eventually lose thier job and die an early death. y? the poverty line is 16k. that means that if u make 12k a year at McD's (and u have to be promoted to manager to make that much, or should I say little, cash), u still dont make enough to live in the most squalid conditions. Welfare pays better. So their comes a question: Is it better to work your ass off, 40 hours a week, then walk home, or is it better to make 16k on welfare not working, then adding thousands of dollars in cocaine money to that in a neighbor hood where the police don't protect or serve, but are only to happy to pin u to the street and yell NIGGER!!, the risks are not great. then after u are done working a few hours a work on the corner, your drive home in yer excalade with 24 inch wheels. It really comes down to how good a person u r. i would not starve working 40 hours when i could thrive selling drugs. not a chance in hell. die or die early? i say die early. how much is being moral worth to you. per year, i mean. think about it. then hink about blacks on welfare. then leave them the fuck alone.    okok, that was alot of angry stuff there. I will lighten it up with some pick-up lines i found.  Do you have any raisins? No? How about a date? Are you a parking ticket? (What?) You got fine written all over you. Hey baby, you've got something on your butt: my eyes. If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together. If you were a booger I'd pick you first. Baby did you fart, 'cause you blow me away! You know what? Your eyes are the same color as my Porsche. Are you going to kiss me or do I have to lie to my journal? ( I may have to use that with blog in place of journal) Baby, if you were words on a page, you'd be what they call fine print. Excuse me, is that your perfume that you are wearing? (ok, read it agian. got it? good!) Has anyone ever told you that you have Scandinavian hands? (Uh, no.) No, of course not, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to say, wouldn't it? (LOL) I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the best looking one talking to you. Help stop rape--Consent! (ok that's a lil' creepy) If I had a nickel for every time I've seen a woman as beautiful as you, I'd have 5 cents. (that one is good b/c it is true aboot every girl a guys sees, but it sounds good) If you were a laser, you'd be set on "stunning". (that's really kind of sad) Know what I like best about you baby? You haven't maced me yet. Honey, I hate to see you go, but I love watching it. You are like a candy bar: half sweet and half nuts. (i kno women liek that. but then, I also know men liek that) You've been a bad girl. Go to my room.  lovely. see you later

      Today, or more accurately, since we are an hour into today, yesterday, was picture day. I hated it. WhY? I'm glad you asked. It is because well, I dunno. Maybe I have low self-esteem. Nah, I love myself (not just make love to myself, jackass). Hmmmmm, maybe I have low body-image. Hah, I am tall (shut up, it was funny). Maybe it is another psycological self-analysis (you can't spell self-analysis without anal! [and you can't spell funeral without fun!]) Maybe it is because I have to get my hair cut and shave. Hey! That could be it. I haven't liked getting my hair cut since i was a little kid. I used to cry and cry. I didn't like the idea of a stranger being paid to use scissors that close to my head, and neck for that matter (which reminds me, my parents hate me, but that is beside the topic!). I also don't liek shaving. I have imaginged the headlines since I was 14, "14 year old cuts own neck while shaving, prefers death-bleed to embarrasment". lol, I got to say death-bleed (how many hyphens is that?). While i have never actually cut myself shaving, even tho I used to use cheap single blade razors with no foam, I still don't liek it. Maybe unkempt is now a look, w/e. Story time. My mom still thinks I am a kid. But then I guess i am still as naive for trusting her, but neway, here goes: cuppla weeks ago, she says to me:   "hey, Miiiiikeey?"   I say: "Don't call me mikey, asshole. (okok, I sed cocksucker, happy?)"  She says "wanna go to that game place that you spent way too much time in that one day?"  I say "huh?"  She says "I gotta get the fuck outta here, now let's go, and were stopping for coffee."  "werks fer me." (I say that alot.)  So I get into the car, and we go, with the A/C way too cold and the oldies on. I think "It's those hormones she's taking, they've put her back on her cycle again, and it is irregular, so i can't keep track nemore." (I read way too much into shit sometimes.). We go to Highland Plaza. We park in a crappy spot (Both of my parents always park in crappy spots, so they can find the car easier, my mom b/c she is forgetful, and my dad b/c he is old [I love saying that]). She gets out of the car quickly, this makes me wonder, as my mom is large and does not move quickly anywhere. She makes a beeline for the store next to the GameStop. You know. The hair cuttery (nonono, you don't get caps [BAD hair cuttery, BAD]). She opens the door, and detecting my imminent resistence, she yells "Get in here!". I look at her liek WTF? She says "GREEEEEEEEAAAIIIGHH!". So I, detecting her imminent scene, and blaming me for the looks everyone will give her until she leaves, make an identical beeline for said door. Hair gets cut. Electromechanial cutting device is pressed against my neck. It jams, pulling out hair and making me go "SSSSHHHHHIT!". My mothere hears it. I could just hear hear smile. It sounded like something between two baloons rubbing against each other and a door creaking. Even better, it sounded liek an old barbie doll's legs when they are moved very quickly. Did I mention mom is getting old, too? Nvm. Whatsername is tipped well for her follicle abuse. I, and here is the naive part, decide to walk next door, where the GameStop is, to look for Zelda (NES). I found out on a later day that not only did they not have Zelda, but that they do not carry NES games at all. Oh well, I wouldn't have finished it anyway. I already got it for game boy advance. Back to story. She goes "NNNNNNO!", grabs me, and takes me back to the car (long walk). I comply, confused by my all-to-apparent naivete. She starts the car and pops it into reverse. As we start to pull away, I say timidly "hey, ma??" (pause) "ma". "Whadda YOU want?" she says. "Fuck you." I reply, more forcefully. (this reads liek a chilren's book, it does" Now, you might say that this is a rather harsh thing to say to your mother. I agree. The thing is that I knew she was going to be mad at me, sooner or later, that is how she gets. So i decided I rather say "Fuck you." and know when she going to be mad, than sit in the car while she drives agressively and risks my life. So I prompt her, and I am prepared for the fight that would have been a surprise later in the drive. Anywho, we drive. She argues and tell her she is not fit to drive. We stop for coffee at starbucks. I had a vanilla frapachino, she opted for chocolate. (when she is in that mood, she opts, liek a movie star, she doesn't choose, liek a common person.) We drove home. The argument ends before she turns off of Kennedy, to go home. We arrive home just in time for the happy part of the mood swing (that means no meaningless for for me to shirk until she is off of her cycle), and I go in and start clicking away at my PC. Manipulation. Like mother, like son.   Moving along, what was I going to prattle on aboot next? O yah. Picture day. I was at the place where the pics were to be taken. i hate it. I was showered, fully clothed, clean shaven, and my hair was nicely cut. I was already completely out of my element. Next part of pix being taken somebody tells me what to do. I hate being told what to do. That is different from being asked, being told is being asked, having added the presumption that I will do exactly what they ask. Added on to the fact that i have been told to do things that I don't want to do, it is a stranger. It was a woman (sounds good, right?) but a, ugly, middle-aged one (wrong!), and she had an eyebrow piercing (now THAT'S wrong!). She also talked down to me. I hate that, too. example: (presumptuous tone) "turn right" "What do you mean?" "I mean turn right" "You said that. What do you mean?" (blank stare) (cue stoopid question, aaaaaaand go!) "whaddyoo mean, whaa-ddoo i mean?" I say "Do you mean head, torso, entire body? What do you mean?" (duh tone) "I mean, whole body." She is being an ass, I will too. (blank stare) keeps going, keeps going. "what?" she says. "how far?", I ask. "all the way", she says. I get up. turn all the way around (the left way), and sit back down. "no, that isn't what I meant." "OOOOOOO, right, you meant the other way." I turn twice right, once to make up for the left, and once more to actually turn right. She stops her bull. Well she jsut sed one more thing. The only difference betweent outfits one and two were a tie. So, after outfit one, I get up to get my clip on (the first was a regular tie, so I came with it on after I figured it out.), and she says "Is this going to take a long time?" So I think "Ain't had enough, bitch?, alright.", I turn completely around, Look at her under my eyebrows (Jack the Ripper style), and bark at her. She jumped. I thin she peed a little. I got my tie, and my relative silence from her. I also got her to release her tone. Best pix i have taken. That lets you know how much I dislike them.  Next. I dislike handing out pix. My mom never gets enough wallets, and if she does, she sends them all to ppl near the bottom of our christmas-card list, in hopes they will actually send one back (they don't, maybe I scared them off, or maybe I intimidated them, nah, the first one.). So I only get a few, and they cnan only go to my closest friends. (female friends only, guys dont want pix of their buddies, they know what they look like, which, coincidentally is my excuse for not likeing getting my pic taken, if I want to know what I look liek, I will simply look in the mirror.) But now, this year, my co-workers want some. It is only two, but one is a manager that I am cool with. She is nice, I could not hope for a better superior. The other is a young lady. We are friends. We are only friends because she is a whore. She is playing her ex, against my reccomendations warning aboot his percieved getting of poon once he is done with his menial task. She had him clean her car, inside and out, and then went and made out with another dude I work with that is too much of a pussy to even ask her out. He cried after he was done cleaning the car , beacuse after he was done, she was making out with my co-worker. They are both stoopid pussies. waitwait. All three are stoopid pussies. yaaah. Where was I? O yah, I dunt want to give out too many pix, cuz they are limited. I think I will act mad at Victoria (whore), so I don't have to give her a pic, then give one to Ronda (cool manager). Next, after I have given a cuppla more pix out, if I have one left, I will say I am sry to Torie, and give her a pic to seal the deal. Gawd I am manipulative. Anyway lemme fill in the blanks. Asad (pussy) is dating Victoria (whore). Victoria was dating Chris (car-cleaning, crying pussy). I hope that kid doesn't own binoculars. or a hatchet. I think I will lend him my binoculars. and my hatchet. Nah, I dont feel that sry for him, I mean he IS stoopid, and prolly suicidal, not homocidal. But I wouldn't put the binocular bit past him. Newho, I dont liek him b/c he called my work, and when he was told that working ppl are not available for personal phone calls (Tor understands this), he started to argue. He went right past step 2: ask nice, and straight to step 3: bitchy. This is bad for a few reasons. First, when he was calling as bf, it was personal buisiness, second, he was a man (I don't liek guys I am competing with [I kinda was at the time, I wanted poon, and ignored that she was a whore]), and third, he cussed at me and my co-workers, fourth, he said things about ppl that werk at McD's (even tho his gf werked there), and fifth (man is this guy an asshole!), he said things aboot black ppl. Nice job, pussy, now yer gf talks aboot how yer getting played, and how yer a pussy, and how you dry liek a pussy. Moving on. More on him later. Bradley is Victoria's ex (also co-worker). Brad was a good boy. It was cute how good he was to her, and how good she was to him. It was corny, even. Well, sorta. Victoria parties. Without Brad. I kno what that means, u prolly know what means, too. Brad dint. It din even cross his mind until late in the relationship. He sed to me "u think she's cheating on me?". I sed "i dunno, maybe, maybe not, but that is not something you should jsut throw around within earshot of enbody who gossips around here, cuz it will get out, and she will be offended." he says "well what do i do, then?" I say "wait for eveidence, do not act on suspition." He didn't. He decided to show up at a party. She was all over this one dude. It was nothing overtly sexual, so he just asked her, politely, "what's up with that dude and u?" she says "nothin', don't worry about it." That dude's name was Chris. He was a possesive asshole. Brad eventually catches them doing something overtly sexual, and he breaks up with her. She is not even mildly regretful. She showed up at the McD's, stoned as hell (that is what she says, but I have been wasted, and I kno what ppl look liek wasted, and she dint look wasted from my point-of-view, but she gets benefit of doubt) and she is giggling, jsut laughing it up with friends, and the occaisional co-worker that walks by. Then she leaves. Brad is pissed. "She dint even look sorry" he sed. "I kno", i sed. How could somebody get stoned, right after the broke up with a good guy? Cuz she was playin him? Anywho, it doesn't take long before she realizes how much of an ass Chris really is. He took car keys, told her what to do, and so forth. She dint realize it b4 cuz she had brad to treat her right (he had no sex with her, it is a commitment to God, I think), and Chris to treat her crappy, but fuck her (no pun intended). Brad is not rich, he lives in EC. He boucht her bunches of crap. She liked it. She stepped on him. Moving along, she dumps Chris liek the asshole he is, and is alone. She says she is going to play the kid for stuff, and is warned myslef, and many others, that if she does that, he will expect something in return. If his past show of character is any indication, i think she is in trouble. She got herself in tho, in spite of my advice. Now Brad is with another co-worker, Jen. That hasn't produced any original drama, jsut drama that has stemmed off of the brad-vidtoria-chris-asad thing. She wants stuff that is more expensive than the sutff he gave to Torie. It has been sed that jen and brad were making out in the customore part of the mcdonald's, and so forth. All stoopid. The whole thing is. Dating at work when yer 16 = stoopid. Being a playing whore = stoopid copeting with ex's = stoopid. ppl talking about it = stoopid. the "mature adults voicing their opinion to those involved = stoopid, u get the picture. wait, no you dont, I am mad at you, may u get a pic later, cya whore!

      OOOOOOOOooo man. It hax ben a dey. Here we go. I woke up, awoken by lynette and brandy, to go for that walk, just a bit late. I slept in. I do that alot. I love summer. I am gunna go go-karting for a few hours tmo, that'll be fun. but back to the subject. We took our somewhat short walk and came back to her house where we hung out. That was ok. It made me think about stopping smoking. Fuck that. Either stress or smoke will kill me. I was whisked off by my mom to the mall to look for clothes for my senior pix. I got some stuff on sale and some silvertab jeans. I went to hot topic alone b/c my mom is scared of that place. It costs too much money to look goth. $22 for a t-shirt that said SQUEE! and some of the all too famous artist's art. Fuck that. I like the way the sutff looks, but i dont love it. not 5 hours of my time for a t-shirt. nope. They are as bad as A&F, I sed it. Moving along, I went home and was taken to the highland police station for my teen court date. The guy there was stupid and rude. He didn't know anything about the court at all. Dumbass. I come home and i find out my sis ter has discovered some of my old game boy games. including the legendary. Pokemon. This was the yellow version. I popped it in my retro SP and I have been wasting my time since.  o dear, o dear, what to do, what to do  hmmmmm  www.jibjab.com they have fun stuff, rich sent me the link to their newest jab at both bush and kerry, it is funny, go see it.  www.atomfilms.com they are an indie film site featuring jib jab stuff, it is where i learned of jibjab from, go see them, too, anywho. good night

      well i had an awesome blog for here, it took me like 3 hours and it was deleted let me tell u how opera has this feature where u can have a right-drag perform a function. well, i found out which one means "destory a three hour blog" right drag up, right drag down i turned that off, but my blog is gone fortunately, i have found an OTC drug that I like, and i am still under it's influence, so I am not very mad Drugs are fun like that. 60mg pseudoephedrine, plus 60 more a half hour later. fun fun I always seemed to liek (new english, kiddies!) simple CNS stimulants. caffeine and nicotine ahev been it for me until this.

      Politics. It is serious rant time.Plz excuse typos. There are two presidential contenders. 2 men and 2 men to take their place if they are shot. Does this fool anyone? Does anybody really think that these men are in it for the ppl of this land? Do you really thik you are rich enough to vote? Do you think it mattered that the last election was decided in a courtroom? What a sham. These men are in somebody's pocket. Anyone worth a damn is in somebody's pocket. They are not out for the personal interest of you or me or Bob or Jill or anybody that doesn't own a multi-national corporation. They only want a few things. They want us to maintain internal peace and order. The ways to do that? Go to war every few years, or at least have military activity every so often. 1910s-WWI 1920s good economy, at least if u were well off. 1930s-depression 1940s-WWII 1950s-good economy for the rich, and those who fought were ok, too 1960s-Space race, cuz we cant nuke the ruskies if they can nuke us back 1970s Vietnam- this was fun b/c ppl were shot on TV and so Merika says "What? were killing ppl? good innocent ppl like u and me? We are fighting for something they dunt believe in, but we want democracy for all ppl? What?, All they want is money? 1980s-Iran until good economy,then on the heels of recession 1990s persian gulf then good economy 2000s 9/11 terror, Aghanistan, Iraq (WHY?!?!) and by golly gee the econmy is doing good again. What's next? Korea? Mars? (did somebody drop a hint that there was oil there? [NASA aint dumb]). Honest, inelligent ppl that i know are not only voting, but for these ppl. Who gives a shit who sits in that chair? Somebody owns them. And not at half-life, either. To all of you patriotic imbeciles i say: OPEN YOUR EYES! LOOK AROUND YOU! READ A BOOK ON POLITICS! Read one. One book that is of a semi-political nature will tell at the very least that the system is corrupt to the very core. Anything left wing will, anyway. 6 corporations own the communications of the planet. They will do what it takes to maintain this order. If you own the communication, you the ideas. But mike, if they own communication, then how come there are so many books and articles and tv shows out there about how the system is corrupt out there? I will tell you. You will read those books, you will watch that TV, u will read articles in the news, and u will not be fighting. You will be calm. You will be shamefully appeased. You will believe the government was made by the common man, you will believe that the common man benefits from it, and you will continue to live in the system. American history is wrought with class struggle(before mass media). You didn't know that? You didn't know that there was a socialist party in the united states until all of their leaders were sent to jail for speaking against the war (WWI)? You didn't know that speaking against the government is illegal? They sent ppl to prison for sedition for that. You still got an A in history? I bet you did. They taught you other things. They didn't lie, they just didn't tell the whole truth. Did they tell you that there used to be a huge, inter-industry union? Did they tell you that they were sent to jail for the same reasons the socialists were? That sux. Maybe you wouldn't have bought in. Or maybe...  you would have anyway. What can you do? What can a person do without organizing? What can a person do without making himself known? Maybe you would be important, right?, a real history maker. Or maybe, you wouldn't make it into the books at all, other than one more person for president? Maybe you would become an unperson. The people who were supposed to know who you were might be made to forget, or remember it without significance. Then your family would die, only recorded with birth and death and marriage and military service certificates. That is all that matters to them, you know. You get born, you get married and make more proletarian, you get shot at for a cause you wouldn't believe in if you knew anything about, or, even if you did, you would shoot to keep from dying. Then, the last part, you die. Did you die of ignorant bliss? Did you die reasonably appeased? Did you die bent and broken by a system designed to do just that to you?   What does it all mean? Does it mean I will make a run at the system? No. Does it mean you should? No. Is there anything to be done? No. Am I happier to know what I know? Fuck no. I wish i was dumb as a rock. I wish I loved america like a 3 year old loves it's mother. Mama=good Anyone against Mama=bad. But I can't. I can't feel that way. What am I going to do? I am going to carve out my menial existence. I am going to have at least one wife and at least 3 kids. I am going to find a nice house and drive a nice car and I am going to go to work and support my growing family. Then, when I retire, I am going to keep living until I die. Sound like fun? It's all you get.  I think that's all I got. I am still angry, and I will be for a long time, but I am still going to do what they dont wasnt me to do. I am going to drink to get drunk, I am going to smoke to get high, I am going to be critical of the gov't which will not be overthrown, but best of all, my favorite part, I am going to let ppl know something. Laws are paper. They are only as valuable as that which they are written on PLUS the value you give them. Live life how you want to live it, and don't take any shit, and life will get better for ppl. Show your indoctrinated brothers in the police and in the military that they aren't fighting for what the ppl want, even if they get violent. Hack the ruling classes support among the poor (us) slowly to pieces. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. We may trip, we may fall, one person can be silenced, but a movement, an undercurrent, a suffocating swath of people fighting cannot be supressed.   or maybe it wont happen at all, but it is worth a shot

      I care about my job too much. McD's, in case u dint already know, is where i beat my feet. I think it is jsut because it has become my life. well, it has, almost. The situation goes liek (that is how i spell it from now on) this: My sister goes on vacation by herself as a reward for finishing high school (holy shit!) on time (holy shit!) so she chosses to see our redneck relatives (tho that is not to say that i am particularly sophisticated) (poor but not criminal, not smart but not dirt stupid liek [again!] some ppl i know, basically good, hospitable ppl ["we ain't got much, but what we got we share."]). I called it while she was down there. I said "she is gunna wanna live down there.". To which my parents replied "may-be." She came back not long ago and said "hey dad, (as he was the only parent in the car at the time) I was thinking of moving down to Georgia with our family, what do you think?" My dad replied "You can do what you want, yer 18.". My Mom, who found out later, was hysterical, fucking hysterical. She cried and cried. She also took the time to offend our relatives by saying "We can do more for her than you guys can.", "We can put her through college; what can you guys do?" (this is althogh she has made it quite clear that, even tho she has the cash to spend, she is not giving us any help at all, period,[Was that redundant?]since kindergarden [That was redundant]), we have more money (more direct), and so forth. Naturally, she (Gina, my half sister), is offended, she goes off the handle and says she doesn't want anything to do with my family except Melanie. Gina doesn't even want to talk to her own father because of this bs. O yah, Mom also said she would rather Melanie went to Georgia then went into the USAF, which is a good way to offend a family whose men all go into the marines, except me. I play peacemaker in this situation, and it doesn't work. Everyone will talk except Mel. Well shit, that's liek establishing a democracy without the input of the populace (wait...). More updates on thatlater.  siiiiiiiiigh. I need a new gf. I just broke up with the last about lying to me. Then she tried to keep me by saying she is pregnant. I stuck around for a negative test and left. I did not say a whole lot about the test, even tho we were protected because my family is kinda, uhh, productive. My mom had one ovary (more on that in a min), my dad had on a spermicidal condom (99.9% effective, even if broke, and condoms themself are 97%). The first time my parents fucked, there was a Melanie. My mom was married in the third trimester. My dad, not being the college man, thought my mom was sterile. He thought melanie was a miracle, a one-in-a-million shot. The very next time they fucked, there was me. (half brother danny, same thing, w/o te sterile thing.)O yah, did i mention my dad was 44? Did I mention he was broke, and bankrupt (damn!), he had a kid living with him (1 of 3) (Damn!), and that my mom was a 17 years younger blonde? (DAMN!).   Weird thing, life is.  What was I getting to? 0 j@h. Gf. McD's. There is this girl, a friend of a co-worker whose name escapes me (not much of an insult, really, my memory 5v>  Music sux lately. Well, white ppl music sux, neway. The Roots, The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Lil' Jon, and D12 (We've recently traded Colin Powell for Eminem, Em has come out as black, and Colin has come out as white, altho some some would say this is an eccentricity born into them, but nvm) have dominated my playlist lately. This is the part where I do a review sort of deal. The Roots push their seed in her bush for life in the video The Seed 2.0, I give it a 7.5. Good song, good cinematography, and so forth. Usher pulled off an awesome video with Lil' Jon and Luda for an 8.0 on my scale for the classic objectification of women/dancing video. The Black Eyed Peas pissed me off. Let's Get Retarded became Lets' Get it Started. WTF? U kent say retarded on TV? Or u are just a pussy? Lick my balls. U get a .5, just b/c there has to be space at the bottom for every pop/country video ever. D12 is still recovering from Purple Pills/Hills. If there had not been an AMC Gremlin in the vid, and if the vid wasn't actually pretty damn good if u uncensored it, I'd doc them on My Band. But as it stands, 8.5. The crossdressing got me. Kids in the Hall thoughts were provoked. I became happy, and that takes alot.  Okay here comes the shitty vids. Avril could suck my dick if she wasn't so dirty a whore, may I am not enough of a sk8er boi. Britney can go to hell, straight to hell, without her 200 mil of plastic surgery, for what she does to the self esteem of a nation, porn belongs on pay per view, and the music is better. Hillary Duff. Dammit, I already used the dirty bit. Well I guess she came clean. O wait. She aint clean. I guess she just came.   that is it. good night 1337 hH>

      Hello ppl, I have finally given into the urge to blog, and slowly fill up the internet with usueless trash nobody will ever want to see except my descendants, maybe not even them, as I am sure that they will want to play fianl fantasy XXXIV. But w/e. My intention, with this blog, is to record some of the fucked thoughts that make their way through my mind, as well as some of the occurances since the last blog (except this one, which is intro and last cuppla days). There is no telling how long that may be. Altho I guess it woun't be that long b/c my memory sux. What the hell am I doing up this early? I'm glad you asked. Before I fell asleep yesterday, I had not slept in 48 hours or so. 16 hours of that were spent at werk, including the last 8 tortuous hours spent trying not to collapse from a standing position. O well, I gots paid. I am going to an autocross event tmo...later today. It will be fun as long as my car doesn't fall apart. I never understood why it was chosen to put the division between days at midnight. It seems much more logical ot me to put that split at sunrise. That is how I think of it, and I often have to correct myself b/c of it. It has been said to me that if i slept at night, it wouldn't matter to me at all, to which i replied "STFU, voice-in-my-head" (Is voice-in-my-head hyphenated? [I suppose I get to pick; I pick YES!]). But really now, standards are not made for the everyday occurance, but for the exception that must also be measured, in the same way that trust is not for when you are watching somebody. Of course, then there is the whole measurement of the time of the day that we go through, but nvm, I will save that for a later blog, much later. like in the P.M. (I hate that.)  GOOD NOIGHT! MORNING, W/E!

      	my o my it has been awhile. I have been spending all my free time on ABS forums lately. That stuff will rot your brain. Ask the dumb philosipher is my favorite thread. It is where you ask serious questions (or stupid ones), and get stupid answers. It is fun. There are also little games here and there, that ppl make up, that go inthe forum. There is one where you have to come up with a band name starting with the last letter of the one above you. It is a good way to boost post count. Also along those lines is the "What are you thinking?" thread, which is now reset every month, because of how big it can get. It is an excellent forum, and I plan on stealing content from it now and then.]  http://www.absforums.com  	Those forums have made me think about the recent trend in men's fashion being more towards the "gay" side of the spectrum, kno? It seems like the trend is that ladies are saying that they want men to be "everything but gay" a.k.a. "metrosexual" (note the avid use of quotations, I type as I speak, so u can imagine me doing that quotation thing all of the time.). This bothers me. If ladies want gay guys, doesn't mean we are all doomed? So then I ponder: What exactly do they mean by "everything but gay"? This site:  http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html  helped connect the dots a bit. I will postulate a theory. Some traits that are common among gay men, ladies actually want (proper grooming, complete comfort around women), some they say they wnat, but it would not be good to give it to them (interior decorating skills, ability to cry), and others they just don't want (buttsex). I would appreciate feedback on this topic. It intrigues me.  O, will someone tell me why "gullible" doesn't appear in the dictionary?  I pondered, recently, my love of cars and, by extension, people's love of cars. I think it began as I made a deposit in my savings account and looked at the balance. It was over 1400$. That is almost enough to put a new motor in my car! yay! but moving along. I wanted kill my mothere when she drove my car. She let my sister sit in the passenger seat (or rather, the seat closest to the passenger side door, as it is a big-body six seater). She told me to get into the back seat for a ride to work. in my car. that she was driving. that I hade to save 1500$ to buy. by working at McDonald's. As funny as it sounds, though, it wasn't just the money. That car is mine. I don't know how to explain it better than that. The car was even more mine than other things, liek my desk or chair. I guess you could say I was possesive of my possesion. I am almost territorial about that car. Weirder yet, I am not as possesive of my new (1987 model) car. I forget to lock the doors alot. I don't get it repaired right away. I have to prepare a lsit of things that need to get repaired on that thing. So, not only do I love cars, I only really LOVE one car. That is creepy, don't you think? Maybe I just need a gf. That isn't it, because I have had gfs while i had the car, indeed that is part of the reason I bought it initially--so I could date without getting a ride. I don't know. I guess I can't really explain it. I love cars. I should prolly mention that I named my car. I named my 1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 (the car I LOVE) Heather. I name it after this chick with big knockers. She left town a cuppla years back. I named my 1987 Toyota Celica GT (the car that gets me to work, usually) Ta. It is a japanese term of endearment, usually expressed as Ta-Kun. OKOK I got it from a TV show, but that is still the name. Come to think of it, I also named my PC. I named it Edward, after Radical Edward from Cowboy Bebop. Edward is a girl. That is a detail. I think I will explain the rules surrounding naming. Cars and computers get names. My last computer was named Jill, after a skinny whore who still goes to our school. What was suppose to be my first car was named Nicole, after no person in particular. It was a 1989 Nissan Sentra. I had some fun in that car (don't tell the parents). After something has been deemed worthy of a name, you need to decide whether it is a male or female. How do you know? reliability. Unreliable things malfunction. mal-function. They get male names. Other things get female names. I had Edward running for a month straight, no prob. I also have made no reapirs to it. It is on almost 100% of the time. A computer/car msut be renamed after a large repair has been made. On a computer, this is at least a HDD. HDD, motherboard, processor, allgrounds for a re-name. In a car, if you replace the motor, as I intend to do with Heather, you must rename it. When Heather gets a new engine, she will get a female name, because she should be even more reliable than before. yah. that is how that works. I need to make that list of things to be repaired. I am taking the car in Tues. LATER!

      Hello again! WARNING: THIS COULD MAKE YOU RATHER SICK, SKIP TO THE LINE OF ASTERISKS IF U ARE A PUSSY! ****************************************************************** Why the fuck do I have to be so damn curious? huh?  http://www.ag0ny.com/images/2004/05/13/hamster-porn/hamster-porn-P1010027.jpg  go ahead! copy and paste! Good god. After I saw the site on dolphin sex, I think to myself "I wonder if there are other sites liek that." Then comes the Google box on my Opera browser (Screw IE!). I look up stuff. I will say it again, ppl are fucked up!  http://www.algonet.se/~giljotin/explan.html  He's married to the Berlin Wall. Yah, married. to the berlin wall. They were married in 1979. I wonder if he is pissed off at Reagan. nvmnvmnvm, don't ask what that means. Did he just say one day "I love the Berlin wall!". Then his little sister says "Well if you love it so much, why don't marry it?". Then he says "Yes!, I think I will!". WTF? Now I think to myself "are there other ppl liek this?". i don't just mean married to the berlin wall, or places in general. I mean, do ppl love things? I mean, do ppl love things sexually? Well, yah they do.  http://www.geocities.com/gnxlover/  Go there. He likes to have sex with cars. I do not mena that he likes to have sex in cars or on cars, an activity I enjoy myself. I mean that he likes to have sex WITH cars. 1980's cars. The sick bastard.  http://blackroses.textfiles.com/sex/sex-cars.faq  That is a guide as to how one would have sex with a car. Go ahead. It tells you how to make an SIU. What is an SIU? It is a sexual interface unit. It is what you use to have sex with a car. It also equates the tailpipe of a car to the anus of a person. Dear lord I hope no one is sitll reading this.   http://www.onzin.nl/fufme/index.shtml.htm  That is how you have sex with another person through the computer. That's right kids, you can have sex over the internet using your computer. Also, it's $500 for one. ************************************************************************  OK. that is over. Just one more thing of note, really I put it here for the ppl who didn' read the other part. A year or two ago, RED MEAT became my favorite comic, replacing Speed Bump, and a bit earlier, Dilbert.  www.redmeat.com  It is hilarious and dark. i saw it in the onion first.  www.theonion.com  It is a parody of the news. It is liek the daily show in print. It is schweet.  This is my second-favorite comic. It is called toothpaste for dinner. It is cool. There is horrible art and bad handwriting. But it's content is awesome. It is kinda liek NES. They dint have any processor to work with, so all the games looked crappy. If they wanted to sell any games at all, they had to have a damn good idea. This leads me to all that is evil in hollywood today. You might have heard of a movie about the the world getting royally fucked up by climate change. It sucked. It's name shall not grace a blog of mine. Millions were spent on the special effects to make it look liek NYC had been taken over by the ocean and then frozen. There were also CG wolves that attacked the main character. It was horrible. I sat through the whole thing thinking "at some point this movie will get better and it will be worth it". It dint get better. It sucked liek a Thai hooker. lol, i capitalized "Thai".
