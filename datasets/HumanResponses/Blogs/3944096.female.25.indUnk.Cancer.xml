      "Oh, we must keep in touch!" - Cyber-Superman Morten Korslund comes to the rescue of all of us that, in a emotional moment, threw this line at every dear friend in the room. A new project is born: The Cagliari 2003/20004 ERASMUSEES' Blogsite!

       well... Amy and Hafdis...   Could it be that the all over amount of alcohol that´s been drunk by all the Erasmus people per month stayed just the same after all of us left???   ...which s nice...

       he he just found the colour thing, ok firstly I DID NOT HURL i just felt a wee bit queasy probably due to Ivan's manic driving skills, secondly i ......i cant actually remember what else except your woman is in no position to be passing comments on anything since everyone on the bloody motorway saw her ass!!lousy come back but i think the heat is affecting me and im trying to have  a conversation with my friend on messenger at the same time....she has a new boyfriend so its far more interesting!!      Anyway, i was not near as drunk as Hafdìs was so therefore my story is far more credible than hers!!      Ok im going to the beach!!no doubt we'll be drunk at the weekend, let you know how that goes!!Amy

      Yeah, you know who you are!    Anyway, got drunk tuesday with hmmmm... Amy of course.  Went to the beach, nothing happened, sang cellphone ringtones with Albertino AND Amy though she refuses to admit it.  Fell asleep in the car on the way back and woke up with the biggest headache ever.  Shouldn't have gone out at all.  Jerzu sunday night was coooohoool.  Free booze.  Didn't expect US there now did they??  Got absolutely wasted, not as wasted as Amy though who wandered off in the woods because she thought she had to hurl.  We were about to call the Carabinieri but she showed up eventually, with one shoe on and the Swedish flag in her hand.  Oh and I found out, while peeing on the highway that my hair smells really good.  Bacio...

      Hey everybody ! back home again, and feeling strange as probably most of U! But  don´t actually have time to think whether I like it or not, ´cause there´s just to much to do, too many friends to say hello to and too many amaaaiiizing things to rediscover about my beloved Bavaria ;-)  - Hope you won´t beat me up for that Amy-just had to mention it for your sake !! Miss U, Chrissy

       Sorry folks! I never ment to just suddenly disappear from your lives completely! My cell phone is down, so I haven't been able to re-squillo or text anyone so far. I'm working on the issue, though. For more details and updates I also have my personal blog:   urlLink http://kauge.blogspot.com
