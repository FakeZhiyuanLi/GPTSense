      Greetings Mortals!  Webmaster J once again blogging one up for absoulutly no reason!   Ive been upt he alotment today totaly out of my mind digging all morning and it got me a thinking about gardens and how deeply underestimated they are at being one of the coolest places ever!  Stop before u go stright to the game and let me finish, i mean in the garden its warm and there are colours that arent grey!  Plus you can perfect my fine art of tipping and relaxing with a beverage of your choice!  May i recommend my latest find which is bacardi white rum and iron brew :P its dam good for tipping and relaxing!  Also if you in to it (we know Craig is) you can create your own little piece of pixy living heavan in a shroom patch!  Also perfect places to drag out some speakers and play rock music really loud!  because in the garden nobody cares because they all either tipping and relaxing or on shrooms!  I mean they are ace!  Plus they coolest on a summers night get candles and look at the moon!  Howl!  lol well for all your deeply indoors types or peopel who aint mad!  dididididididididididiiddi GAME!   urlLink So Weird Its Gotta Be Ace!

      Hey Me here again  About half an hour after my post earlier today somethign deeply weird happend to me.  I was walking past the TV in my lounge then for no reason the TV turned on.  Now this was very ring esc and kinda creepy but i swear ot was true.  Then i noticed that all the clocks pluged into the mains in the house were claming they had a power cut by flashing on and off, but the weird thing is, they were and still are registering that the power cut was 20 mins int the future!  Now this didnt end the weirdness because i had to take my dog for a walk so i put my cane down to put his lead on and walked out the door with him, then i remembered i had left my cane so went back to get it.  But it wasnt were i had left it!  I search the house for this cane but finaly gave up and went back to the kitchen to take my dog for a walk, and then my cane was were i thought i had left it, 20 minutes later...  I swear the cane wasnt there when i started looking and how the fuck can clocks register a power cut 20 mins in the future!  So i am kinda a bit freaked.

      Hey Everyone Webmaster J here, not that any of you read this however!  Today im thinking about the lifespan of Homestarmountney and what people of expect of you.  Thats the problem if you make something other people enjoy.  Its a faster, harder fall from when your at the top.  Hey we try our best, but two people cannot be funny all the time!  So its time to tell us what you want.  if you want the site to continue, start giving constructive criticism, or if you want the site to be removed i will remove it.  So just decide ok!  No game today... just want answers. If you really wanna game just contact me i will get you one.

      Hey Its Me Again, well you would be shocked now if Webmaster JT posted lol well anyway im about to witter so if anyone really hates this bit or hates the very sound of my voice jump to the bottom and grab the flash game!  So anyway i was thinking today as i slept till 12:00 about how wouldnt it be great to be nocturnal!  Because we would have the night and the preps would have the day!  It would be even cooler because they would be afraid to come out after dark, like the pesants in Dracula, hehe i wonder what kind of weird subistions they would have, like "If you shout Bloody Benny 58 times he comes and drinks your blood!"  Woah that would be sooo cool well anyway i think im done.  Behold a game!  urlLink Gold Miner!

      It seems our friends over at adamburton.tk they have been studying the changes we make to our site with such great detail, despite the numerous times they have denied copying our site- saying how bad it is, they have finally succumbed to way of the 'Mountney'. Less than a week after we got a new guestbook powered by bravenet they have also been onto bravenet and got a new guestbook. It finally seems that after weeks of taking the rip out of us and our site to hide their own inadequacies they cannot resist stealing our ideas to make up for their lack of imagination and originality.

      Hey Webmaster J again.  I was thinking today about animals and how they like link with Prepitude i mean even Adamburton.somecountryweneverheardof talk about their hero burt being a monkey!  I mean they hang around in packs like mangy dogs, they insult peopel ina  primitive fashion despretly trying to be pack leader and climb tree's and hurl verbal dung on people from miles away just in case they get wasted.  its all about survival with them.  Lol so in conclusion as darwin probably did say when under some big ol drugs,  First the monkeys, then the preps!

      Hey all Webmaster J here hope you all taking pleny of breaks from revision if not stop revising now!  Just wanted a quick witter about Preps today, Joes had one so now its my go.  Id just like to say that Preps have been getting a bit overreactive at the moment, seeing every little thing we do as a challenge, but hey it aint a challenge because to be a challenge the preps have to give us some compatition.  So smile my homestar based chums and keep on laughing and we will keep on making.  P.s.  Flash is this kinda stuff Adam Burton Guys  urlLink Sonic The Hedgehog!

      Just thought id let you know how to spot a prep, I mean with so many around this place you need to know how to spot one. If you know anyone who fits these characterisations then they are a prep:        pathetically self-obsessed, bitchy, insult people to boost their over-inflated ego, cares more about their appearence than anything else, homophobic or thinks that the 'coolest' person is the one who can drink the most. I am sure you are aware that this describes the nobheads who keep writing www.adamburton.tk in the guestbook. What a great way to advertise the originality of your website.

           What many of you may not know is how Mountney carries a leather purse wherever he goes. It is in the style of a medieval, outlaw, vigilante that he thinks he is. He rarely keeps any gold in his purse but what he does keep is very rarely spent unless on a new quiver or bowstring.   Continuing with ye olde style Jeffrey has a Cain which he will use to keep the younger folk in line or (hopefully) use to bash preps!

But hey anyway good luck for all you intergrated and technology people this afternoon (especialy to the poor souls who have both!)  As one who has neither i have no clue whats so ever what im gonna be doing this afternoon, probably a blend of listening to hard rock, writing and skulking round MSN.  Lol so its business as usual!  Now i know ima gonna blog more than once today but i just thought id say now im going on holiday tonight!  Yay so the good nu's for u is that you wont see me for a week!  But hey im still hopeing to blog a little, (there is a sweet internet cafe were im going)  So hope you keep reading and plz check out mine and Balds website he's put A LOT of quality work into that so plz respect it.

       urlLink    I bought Slipknots nu album today after hearing tales about it being very diffrent to the others so here is the Ben Jeffrey Review!  I did enjoy the album its very grown up of Slipknot because in their latest offering they seem to care about the actual music a lot more.  I guess its because they have taken a lot of lessons from there solo projects of Murderdollz and Stone Sour.  There is deffinatly a lot of influence taken from Stone sour especialy, with its heavy rifts and roaring noise being more organized and melodic.  But all you die hard orignal Slipknot fans wont be disapointed because you can tell even though they have grown up its still Slipknot.  I would say this a good quality Angsty album were Cory shows off his true vocal talents.  This is especialy shown up in the flagship track Duality.  However if you want original Slipknot i would say the song for you is Pulse of the Maggots, i dont know about anyone else but it just didnt do it for me that track.  If you dont wanna buy the album i strongly reccomned you at least download these tracks  .Duality .Opium for the people .Vermilion and Vermilion pt 2 .Circle .Before i forget .Danger-Keep away .The Nameless  Over all i was impressed with this album however some songs are a bit of a let down if you want your music a bit more in depth.  They just seem to miss the point sometimes, however well done Slipknot you did entertain me a good quality solid album.  I Push My Fingers Into My Eyes

      Heya.  Its getting later now and i feel it coming on again so once again im gonna have to say some things :P  Yeah it seems the past few days have been pushing my sanity, everyday i see carefree individuals having the time of there lives.  Im happy for them, but i wish i could just once be one of em.  Yeah ive never fitted in anywear, i know this, i think its because i am in truth a little bit mad.    My mothers always told me im mad, and sometimes when i start to realize this for a time i say the strangest things and also do the strangest things.  Lately ive been writing more again, which im happy about... but im also not, because all of this sudden work is fueld by me and my fucked up illusions.  I am paranoid.  I sometimes think that people who are my mates are out to get me.  For this i am truly sorry.  It is just the way i am.  Anyone i call friend i truly do love and im thankful for you being there.  But anyway on with this, im not done yet.  Sometimes of late i feel like ive been pushing against a barricaded door trying to be with everyone else, but it is not others who barricade the door.  No its me and my own insecuritys.  I sometimes worry that im not just a little crazy but really mentaly disturbed somewere, i hope im not.  But i dunno, everyones a little crazy as people always paraphrase in cheap american shows.  But hey.  Woot.  Id just like to be there sometimes and just belong to something, but i also know i couldnt, strange isnt it.  Ive never been good in big groups, give me a one to one conversation anyday, but hey as if anyone would after reading this :P  Thankyou for listening im done.

      Heya.  I all hope you had a good day today and if you didnt do the RS exam today you dont know how lucky you are!  Well anyway today i feel a bit down now, went for a bit of a walk and thought about a few things.  Just a bit deppressing really but hey thats the way things are with me.  I dunno really it just seems like im walking down some dark place at the moment, i know its going somewere weird bu i dont wanna turn back.  It's kinda strange really but im sure i will get over it, i guess its just some nu forms of Angst to tackle and let it get back into its normal state of angstyness.  I guess you could say it was rogue angst.  Well anyway it seems to be takeing me a long time to write not a lot, its very odd, just feel opressed.  But anyway id just like to use this bit to say how much of a knob head Mr Paine is and how i hope he's really unhappy for the shit he has put us though.  Hey well i will probably blog later when i got some more understanding of my present emotion, i gues i just feel kinda down, like im knocking on a door and nobodys letting me in even though there is a shadow in a lighted window.  Au revoir for now.

      Heya!  Omg the strangest thing ever is happening tonight, ive got nothing depressing to witter about!  This feels so strange because normaly by this time at night im entering maximum Eeyore drive!  But hey... you hear that... nothing!  Its really strange and im just expecting it any minute to jump on me and go "Suprise!"  like some dememnted Jack in the Box jumping of the wall of a pokey little alley way.  (lol if i had talent i would draw that picture becaus for some reason that image is very Vivid in my mind!) So if any artists fancy a commision i will love them forever... well actually if you read this blog i already do so i would Doubly love you forever!

      Heya!  Welcome once again to your one stop shop for Teenage angst!  Just had my German listening test the typical affair of some creepy German Shouting likehe's in a Nazi propaganda video.  *shudder*  But anyway for i know this guy could have been shouting directly at me and i still wouldnt have got it.  Yup it was hard, and of course we all walked home on a bit of a downer.  Nothing like talking about whats getting you down to encourage male bonding :S  But anyway ive been really looking forward to this blog because i wanted to say about the emotion of Happiness.  You see i really dont get it at the moment i mean id love to 'be' happy but i just seem to be as always Angst tastic!  I guess i just dont get it at the moment!  Plus it really doesnt help when you have this conversation between Me, Xan and David.  Xan "David i think Ben said he wants to smack you."   David "Well Smack me then!" Me "Dont fucking tempt me"  Yeah not the most pleasant of conversations to have just before a exam... well anyway David, you aint worth my time.    Hehe well im home now and here is the stuff ive just put on to Chill me to bring out the Angst.    .Carlos Santana (feat Chad Kroegar) "Why dont you and i"  (I love this song) .Metallica "Nothing Else Matters" (There is something about this that just seems right to me" .Red Hot Chilli Peppers "Under The Bridge"  Hehe when your down turn to the classics.  Well i will no doubt blog again later so au revoir for now ma cheries!

      Hello!  How are you all this morning hope you all good and anyone who has got a intergrated or German exam today GOOD LUCK!    Lol well as you could see i was once again worshipping at the temple of ANGST yesterday but im feeling ok this morning, also reading the paper one article is on about how some of the oldest CD's from the 1970's are starting to corrode!  YAY you know what that means... some day in the future all Linkin park albums on the face of the earth will be destroyed by the CD plague!  YAY Up with the sickness!  Lol well anyway that definalty cheered me up this morning!

      Heya everyone  Im feeling like some Angst has to be vented again so its gonan be small and sharp.  I guess what im annoyed about is that fact that being nice to some people aint enough.  You know your nice to someone for a long time and they basicly dont even care.  They just ignore you, make you feel small and weak in there presence.  Has this ever happened to you... i hope not, it just gets to me sometimes...

      Heya  First day of the exams today and of course in my typical style im once again finding it difficult to focus on the exams... i take refuge in Angst.  Yeah i guess i do, when im Angsty i feel low but i can think then, truly think.  Its a mindset it definatly is and i guess Angst makes me feel alive.  Yes its a strange phenomen that ive got myself into of late and i sometimes need to remind myself that some people read this blog, well actually they are probably already starting to run the mile away from it but hey, i have to say what i gotta say.    Well anyway id kinda like to describe now what Angst is to me, its gonna be hard but i think writing it down somehow makes it easier, and if people can relate to this im truly touched and happy... well anyway here goes.  I guess Angst to me in its simplest form is Depressed rage.  I wouldnt say it was a emotion as such more than a product of sevral emotions coliding and you know when it hits because it feels like your own soul is devouring itself.  I guess what brings it on in me is certain feelings an thoughts such as Love, Hate, Grief, Longing and id guess the major league one is lack of respect.  Yeah id say those were pretty much the triggers of Angst.  But other people deal with these issues in other ways.  The one thign i would like to say is ANGST IS NOT A BAD THING!  I would say that in a way i love my Angst, it is not a problem that must be removed and people who have it dont need to be cheered up.  Id say just listened to every now and then, yeah id say thats all everyone needs really just to talk and someone to listen to them.  For nobody likes to be ignored.  But is Paranoia really the problem?  I guess thats another thing about Angst, it is a illusive beast that makes you ask questions of yourself, and everyone who has it wants someone to tell them the answer... but of course its not possible you see.  So Angst even though it feels like a black hole isnt all consumeing, its just got you... and when im in the depths of it i always remember, even black holes have got to come out somewere.  But hey thats the end of my little ballard :p  ON WITH THE SHOW!  Yeah today was my business exam and i was in the hall front row faceing my own reflection in the glass that surrounds it.  It was strange because by looking straight forward i could see the looks on everyones faces as they worked... and my own.  *i have very long hair now :S*  It was like being the silent invidulator of the exam, lol i didnt creep around the desks or wear squeeky shoes just to fuck everyone off i just saw the looks on everyones faces... it was very strange.  But anyway the exam i was quite plzed to find was rather easy and the weather outside patted me on the back as i went home lol.  So anyway all afternoon ive just been thinking, trying out once again the whole medative lark. I swear Balds onto something with this, it kinda magnifys your emotion to the point you can almost touch it in your mind... it really is quite brillaint i would recomend it.  So if you want to have a go just take these little steps!  .Find a incredably quiet place (Out in a wood or something, or if you are so blessed as to live in a quiet street!) .Sit in a comfortable position were you know you will not have to think about the way ur sitting so dont make it complicated .Close your eyes (i find this helps i dont know why) .Now just let yourself SLOWLY start to forget all your material worrys (i always imagine im walking away from a city) .And basicly just listen to what your mind wants to tell you, concentrate on emotion not want.  Hehe yes i know very spiritual but alwasy remember everyones got there way of doing things so be your own!  (thankyou very very much Bald for introducing me to this whole idea you truly are a revolutionist!)  Thankyou for listening. Here is the game some of you desire.  urlLink Trogdor THE BURNINATOR!

      Heya Mortals  First things first sorry if the last blog of yesterday depressed anyone or fucked anyone off, i just felt like i needed to vent some Angst.  Well anyway that was yesterday welcome to today my dears.  So anyone i hope youve had a lovely day, as lovely as PIE in fact!    Ive just been around today thinking about the inpending exams and trying to chill out, actually tried some kinda medative stuff a bit like Balds on at the mo, its pretty interesting because its nice to listen to what your mind wants to tell you.    But hey after my major caught on Blog mental anueyrsm of yesterday i feel much better now... kinda like being sick i guess and im optamistic of the week and then im on holiday in the best place on earth for a week!   Yes id like to talk about that place actually.  Some of you already know that me and my family go every year to a place in cornwall called Peranporth and basicly its my second home.  Its a little surfing town were basicly for a whole week i feel totaly free, its always weird because i normaly write a lot more when im down there and its just fun to be with the sea breeze in the hair and the smell of the clean air.  Ive always imagined that id take all my best friends there one day, and i will i promise.    Thats what i imagined today when i tried the old meditation lark... i was their in Peranporth and its really got me excited... it truly is my fave place on earth.  But hey anyway now im all calm again (it was late when i had this synapsis *listening to MUSE* so im glad not many of u heard me roar lol)  But now my head is clear i can do my list!  .Metallica (aint nothing else Matters) .Seeing My Sis and Helpfuly finding out from her its gonna cost about 50 squid to have my hair how i want it .My dreams of buying a trench coat  Yeah i know its a small list but hey i got a business exam tommorow and its bothering me.    Here is your first message of good luck from me during your exams, and remember, When all seems dark remember the candle of your mind and find the person with the match.  Au revoir here is your game.  urlLink 3D snake!

      Heya  Yes i know this is a very unusual blogging time for me to be serious but i feel a wave of Angst has grabbed me and has caused a wave of verbakl vomiting!  Whats caused this you say?  I dont know really just a sudden need to say what i really gonna say and when ive finished it will go away but listen if you will for this needs to be said!  Well hey ima gonna get started now schools over and i have learnt a lot over that time that has always depressed me and made me Angst.  Such as the way that loud noisey people are always given attention and the quiet ones are always ignored.... i dont know why this is, am i the only one who is annoyed by people like that?   guess its another one of Ben Jeffrey's great problems, is he Paranoid or do people have a cause to treat him like he is.    It also kinda annoys me the way some people treat others, the way that if someone extends the hand of friendship the other bites it off or runs away... i dont know if thats ever happened to you but if it has you know it hurts like hell.   You do things for people, and they dont acknowledge you. Have you ever felt like you dont excist to some people and you just want to beg at there feet like they were gods just feel like your excistance is worthwhile?  It stings inside. Its like the warmth you feel from other people isnt in you, its ice.  Have you ever looked into someones eyss and they looked away in disscused or so it seems to you.  Have you ever said hello and been ignored... i do hope you havent.  I guess this is why they call it angst, i would say that Angst is deppresive anger... and it has just spewed from me onto this page.  Im sorry about that but i wanted to say it, it had to be cleared up.  Id just liek to say as a foot note that im very glad my friends are here and they are with me... they take it away when they are with me.  I would also like to hope that i do help people and make them feel loved, and i know people dont like to return love so easy and i accept this but sometimes its hard, to not be acknowledged... but its worth it.  Just be happy.  id like to finish with a little line i wrote myself, id like to think it says something.   "I shall lead you out of the dark place when you call, for i will hear your cry, even if nobody else does."  Thankyou for reading... whoever you are you are brilliant, a individual candle that can drag even the darkest soul out of the gloom.

      Greetings Mortals.  Today was the last day at school ever and we decided we'd party!  Yes we did have a good time but i feel bad that somepeople dont have common decency to not get so drunk they ruin other peoples times.  Id just like to say sorry for that if anyones time got fucked up today and hey mine did to so :( .  Hey but id like to thank the people who kinda tried to make sure we had a good time even though it was sometimes beyond shit, Sophie and Lyndsey, thankyou sooooo much!  Also thankyou everyone who turned up it was nice to know that some people do care! So thankyou to "Big List"    Jess, Sophie, Lyndsey, Bald, Joe T, Joe M, Adam, Wigsey, Josie, Amber, Simon, Giggles, Mark, Paul, Big al, Rach.   Two other people did come but im fucking pissed with them so hey David and Laura, u owe me an apology!!!!  Yeah i saw some shit today but some people just seeing them made it worthwhile.  Lol i finaly actually felt like i was wanted somewere which is quite weird... for me.  But hey we shall have to do it again but i dont think we should bring booze... its just not worth the hastle.  So anyway im kinda upset about the whole thing but hey nothings perfect, especialy if its instegated by me. But hey Adam told me i gotta stop kicking myself over this one... but hey i cant help it, i do it to myself because its easy.  But just so you dont think im a complete fucktard over this i cant believe u David and Laura, u acted like fucking preps today!  Im sorry but you just did you totaly regret what you did tommorow.  But hey the people who did keep sensible and happy made it a good day... thanku it means a lot.  BUT WE MUST DO IT AGAIN!  Because a lot of the people i have been with today i wish with all my heart id been mates with them since year seven, they are some of the coolest people i know and im gonna miss them if you go to Billbourgh.  So if anyone who was with me today is reading this *Big Hug* gonna miss you while your gone, but i will see you again... and i promise we will have a good time.  Hehe so i probably repeted myself loads but i dont really care because thoughts have to be expressed..i truly do love you all, your great people.  Au revoir Here is the game :P  urlLink Multiply and Destroy (Hmm Sounds like capatilism)   Hey and i would like to do a bit of Reverb from what ive seen on Balds post (he's better at this than me lol) and i would like to talk abit about leaving school.  It seems weird that we are leaving, i suppose Lyndsey put it best "It's like something died"  lol well i suppose it is a bit but id like to think that somethings have been born out of it and the friendships i made there will go on with me.  Lol like Mr Walker said "And Bind your friends to your soul with Hoops of steel"  Lol i know he said it, but it made sense to me... Hell well anyway i think ive had my reverb, talk to you again tommorow!

      Greetings Mortals!  Hey im here again, carving a blog off the rock of raving!  I guess one day i will pluck up the courage in this blog o write somethign really shocking because nobody reads it hehe!  But seeing as i havent got it yet id rather just write a little bit about the background history behind Homestarmountney!  Now uc Homestarmountney was a dream of Mine and Webmaster Jt's respectably because i guess we've always enjoyed entertaining the folk of West park!  Well and all of this formed into human form i guess in essance became Mountney.  Kindof like the virgin birth of Mine and webmaster Jt's Humour.    Mountney Quite Frankly is the guy!  But hey what about me and JT!  I guess our humours are very similar but we use Mountney as our public persona!  So there you go, Mountney is the radiation suit that protects u from the full on weirdness of our Humour!

      Greetings Mortals who bother to read this bit!  This week has well frankly and with no words canceled out... Shit.  Yes it has been for me and many others probably the worst week on record.  We havent had it so bad as this week, come on admit it, you know its true!  All week the teachers at our not so beloved West Park have all been hitting that grumpy bong up in the staff room pretty hard!  I mean their was even a casulty on friday of bong overusage when Mr Sambi said he was 'Ill' in lesson, so in anyone elses terms he went for a bit of a kip because he couldnt be arsed!  Now this would have been the best lesson ever if once again the preps didnt raise their ugly burberry capped heads against this strange phenomonen called fun!  Yes its true, they resent it when people who aint preps are having fun!  In other news Stewart Fletchers blog will be cancled for the next few week for inability to type with his right hand!  Yes my friends my week did suck balls for all them reasons and more but one question remains, how was yours!

      Greetings!  Phew, Billbourgh the introduction days are now over, and woah did i have a good time.  It was just so cool because everything so much more relaxed and less opressive than school and the lessons all thoguh will probably be way harder are more interesting and a lot more laid back.  Also its cool because i learnt i can do Tai-Chi woot!  Lol well todays been super cool with me doing History in the morning *Woot German Propaganda*  and then a massive break in between that just to to hang round and chat.  Then after picking up some good Karama by playing match maker *cough still waiting for that!*  Well i wont say who because i dont think they'd apreciate the whole publishign malarky but if you wish to know just ask me.    Woot and as if that wasnt enough for a day *probably would have been if we were still at lame old West Park* i had a kick arse introduction to media, on which the course envolves making a two minute intro to a film and doing a music video!  HOOPLA.  Then to celebrate i drank some more coffe, (had about 4 cups today so far) and wrote some more in my precious "road diary"  woot im sure you will here plenty about that over the hols!  Well anyway it kinda sucks a bit now because i know ive got nine weeks to write this story and it suddenly becomes very real again.  Plus their is a article going for 16 year olds at the Derby Evening Telegraph and i so want to own it for myself and get paid for writeing so i gotta submit two articles ive made before July...  hmm i thinking of sending them a link to my blog... but i think the swearing and shit would put them off so i will jsut hammer out the two articles some time this month *i hope*  I mean that would totaly be my dream job, being paid to write... it would totaly kick arse.    Ohh well some of you ask "What are your plans for tonight Ben? Well ima gonna drink a lot of coffe and stay up alllllll night!  Woo i got some more Edgar Allen Poe to read, plus more story to write.... plus plus plus i really wanna watch interview with the vampire again.  So basicly a very busy coffe and possibly Dark rum (Yum) fueld Ben tonight... err woot.  Plus some serious Music has to be listened to.  Ohh yeah plus if anyones interested in why i randmoly witter about a thing called "Mothman" lately, its basicly a storyt hat is repeated around the world as a large Moth like man beign a harbringer of death... all very interesting creepy paranormal shit!  Woot so if your even remotly interested  urlLink check this out   urlLink This is also pretty cool to on the subject   Lol well anyway thats it cya on MSN probably. Ben.

      Hiya All  Few First afternoon done at Bill and i actually had a good time!  (Shock, Horror, Hoopla, Mittens!)  Yeah i only did to subjects today though with it only being a afternoon, Biology and Communication Studies.  They were both very cool accept i think Biology will be hard!  So if you catch me in September muttering about amalyse structures and sayin g such legendary quotes as "You can drink two pints of your own blood before you get sick"  you will know Biology is takeing its effect.  Hehe Communication studies was really cool aswell, just very relaxed and you know... sooo diffrent from school.  Woo i wrote some shit in my road diary but i dont think ima gonna refer to that in my blog... yet.  Well tommorow it is Media and History, but im also having to look at Psychology to fight off boredom.  I also got a bit of a fresher fair to sign up for activities and so on.  But anyway it did kick arse today but with a full day tommorow it could knacker me quite suffiecntly.  So if tommorow night on MSN im all "Many combobulations elizegerth"  Or "Even though your a dude ima gonna adress u like you was a lady."  You will know im just knackered.  So hey, how was your day today, i hope you got cookies and all the other happy stuff that goes with not having to go to school for ten weeks!  Woot still btw.  So anyway quick bit of Observation i got about Bill.   Its Uber relaxed and a lot less opressive than i always thought West Park was. Its great not having to wear a uniform so that aspect seems a lot less opressive. Its great that you have a lot more freedom to say what you like even when it is adressing a dude as Maam.  Woot Cya Later  Ben.

      Heya  Yup todays the big day and in about fifteen minutes im off to college for my induction thingy.  Well its only the afternoon im doing a full day tommorow aswell.  Err woot.  But i can imagine its impression time today so i gotta practice the big smiles and ignore the whole "What you do for fun question."  Lol because if thats the case, my reading, writing, music listening are gonna make me sound uber boring stright away, i like to stretch the illusion lol.  Woo so im hopeing there arent any prep star runners in my form, or people who hate people who like rock music just because its something to do or it will be all out war from the start... and i need to normaly prepare for that.  Ohh well to anyone who this concerns about Bill, have a great day, meet lots of nice people and enjoy urself!  Also to the people who it doesnt concern have a great day and eat a cookie!  Cya  Ben x

      Hi All  Not been feeling very well today, i think im comeing down with a cold or something, which sucks a lot because im trying to write my story and i cant even think about real life never mind my fiction.  Doesnt help that someones car's all dodged up in the street outside and its making the most annoying sqeaking noise ever.  Ohh well i got my Bill afternoon tommorow and then a full day after that... woo once again i go into a situation were i will no doubt be instantly judged and branded a lunatic.  Woot.  So Ben's Adventures in 3RES will begin, along with the whole Bill experince.  Ohh well let the judgement begin.  Sorry this blogs a bit crap today but im finding it really hard to concentrare because i feel like shit.  ohh well.  Bubye.  P.S. As A Apology for the crapness enjoy this  urlLink Game   ~Uber Edit~  Forcing myself to write some more because i dunno just want to i guess.  This week has only just began, but i know its gonna attempt to be lame, its a week thats throwing up a whole barrel full of nu stuff to deal with.  Its almost like ive just been handed a whole bunch of sheets and its "DO THEM BEFORE FRIDAY OR KARAMA WILL FEAST ON YOUR MISERY"  err cheers for that.  So basicly im feeling a bit run down you know, with this story moving like a snail with the bends, and the whole Bill thing staring directly in my face like a loaded cannon of inevitabilty.  It kinda sucks.  Plus the gloomy haunting GCSE exam results which u know are gonna eventually come, and they better be pretty or i will smash something pretty :P  Plus it really doesnt help that ive got a cold and i will probably have to meet all these nu folk tommorow with a dripping nose and streaming eyes.  Hmm yes make it easier them to brand me with the twat brush.  Woot.  Ohh well im done bubye.

      Greetings!  Hey just came on here to talk about the final headlining act of glastonberry 2004!  Yes it was MUSE and yes they were fucking imense!  Matt Bellamy hammering it out time after time, while still having time  (and Energy) to do a massive random solo while straddling utop his amp to finish the night while Bassist Chris Wolstenholme dived into the crowd to preform a whee little bass solo.  Yes it truly did own, they gave the crowd what they wanted and it was MUSE.  Now i know some of you out their dispise this trio, but truly they did own Glastonberry tonight, with a incredible set from everything from the soft melodys of black out, to a truly stunning version of Plug In Baby.  Im truly happy about that, the only draw back is that they didnt play Muscle Museum.  *sigh* Well you cant have it all.  However Matt's alternative solo's on Bliss truly made them worth listening to, and you could almost forget one of the best songs ever written.  I think they all did incredibly well especialy when they did Blackout... god that song owns.  Special mention to Dominic Howard, he beat his little heart out on that drum kit all night only for Matt to destroy it at the end lol.  But pretty much why this blog is now in excistance is because, i you know love MUSE, and tonight has only cemented my beliefe in how much they own, so please if you dont like em, give em another chance with these songs.  .Plug In Baby .Muscle Museum .Dead Star .Bliss .Blackout .Stockholm Syndrome  But Lets Be Honest, It All Owns.  You will NOT be dissapointed. Plus if you wanna take it further visit there website  urlLink Here   Lol listen to MUSE, you may be depressed but you will know uve listenend to some good music getting that way.

      Heya all.  Well once again just had another massive long drive to see my brother in Liverpool, its good seeing him but the journey dont half suck.  This one was however a little less sucky due to me still thinking about the amazing poems in the book i bought yesterday.  Here is a example of why it kicks serious arse.  The boy with nails for eyes Put up his aluminium tree It Looked Pretty Strange  Because He Couldnt Really See.  I swear if you like Tim Burton, and dont mind poetry you will love "The Melancholy Death Of Oyster Boy And Other Storys."  Lol well anyway its totaly inspired me, and i hope that i will one day be able to put that kind of flare into something so simple... but nobody does it quite like Tim.  He is the master.  Lol well in other New's remember to watch MUSE!  The glastonberry highlights, are on after the fast show on BBC two, which just happens to be on after Kingdom Hosptial tonight so double woot!  But i guess on with the show.  Today ive been under a lot of pressure to do lots and lots of things by family, and it really really sucked.    "What you gonna do with these Ten weeks Ben?"   "Write a book" "Ohh just like your sister then!"  Not what i wanted to hear!  Then after about 15 minutes of my family wittering about how clever and amazing my sister is comes the next question.   "What do you want to be in your life Ben?" "I would really love to be a Author, but medicine and Biology interests me." "OHH A SURGEON!  What a respectable job!" *Imagines himself repeatldly banging his head on a table*  Jesus wept, before they went all corleone family style gangster respectable job not the *family* business style bullshit on me (yes i sometiems swear that my parents think they are in a gangster movie, but with less people called Jimbo 'The Knee' Capone.)  I had to change the subject to what the weather or some random shit.  But of course they turn it to "Ohh you must get out on trips and stuff with your mates Ben!"  ...Yes good plan but we are NOT the secret seven or wahtever the hell!  *sigh* shoot me please.  Au revoir  Ben

      Greetings.  Heya all, got some angst at last, i wondered were it had gone really.  Lol well here it is, for all to see and read about.  I just got a lot of annoying shit on my mind at the moment and i need to rid myself of some of it.  I guess ive got a lot of problems with this whole task i got with the book, i really wanna get it done, to achieve somethign during this ten week and do something i really enjoy doing but the problem is my minds not letting me.  Yup writers block, it just gets you so hard because not only does it stop you writing so you cant enjoy yourself, it also reminds you the reasons as to why youve got it.  Just basicly gives you all your angst, reheated, rehashed and right back from were you last vomited it up.  You know all the reasons for this worry and pain may seem insignificant to some people but they are really there.  Like the little things people say to you, sometimes they mean nothing, and other times they really hurt.  Just makes me wonder about the point in having feelings sometimes, you know when something you feel about strongly is directed at something that will never care, be concerned or even bother to validate the excistance of a feeling, then what is the point in having that feeling in the first place?  It Hurts to love, so Hurt loves itself.  I sometimes feel if god made us... he made us wrong.  I mean the human mind is obsessed by massive gestures and feelings, the simple things on a base level never seem enough.  Basicly like Breed 77 Say "If i paint you a picture and the paint is yet to dry, could you live with jsut a whisper?"    The Truth is, most people cant.  Another thing that annoys the ever loving hell out of me is the way some people believe they are better than you.  Now normaly i would just laugh this off, but you do always wonder why.   Lets face it they are quite obviously fuckers who use all there fancy terms and shit to tell you how sane they are compared to you and that your experssion, is just some 'Teenage' thign that some people go through.  Who gives them the right to declare that on you like so much garbage from a great height.  I guess in the end everyone is self obsessed, its biologicaly in our genes to be, but how do people take it so far as to shout at you in the streets and hang round in packs, imtimadating people, and basicly crushing.  Why do people feel the need to validate their excistance by hurting others?  I believe that if people decided to understand rather than judge a bit more, society would be better, for example if someone paints a picture in black and red, does that make them insane... no.  If someone writes a story that isnt about teenage crushs, and doesnt have a pink cover does it make it a bad book... no.  If someone weres a diffrent shirt to someone else, does that make them a bad person... No.  But its all well and good preaching a world of no lables and be neutral.  But there is a very large problem with that.  If you are neutral, and let peopel spite you and not spite back, you have aloud someone permission to punish someone else.  Kinda like passing on a worry.  Now i cant do that.  I guess you could say that i am flawed on the basic level that i will call you a chav, or a prep or wahtever, but only if you opress me.  Nobody should be aloud to hurt someone else.  But i guess thats why i feel this writers block, because of my flaws, and my problems, but i work on a very basic principle of balance, and today someone pushed the scales the wrong way for me.  Thx for listening.  Ben.   ---------------- "People can do great things if others believe in what the creator themselfs cannot believe in"  I will always believe that you have the power to do what you want, even if you cant.

      Hiya all  Hope your all having a good day today and that you didnt go to town today *shudders* i dont think ive ever seen so many Chav's in one place, it was like some kinda Chav fest.  *sigh* lol well anyway i suppose it was quite cool because i managed to get something i actually wanted for a change yay!  Its a really cool book by Tim Burton and its piccy is here.     Yes i know very nice title isnt it, well im looking forward to reading that later, (YAY Angsty Poetry!)  lol well in other news ive managed to get my story started!  Double yay!    Lol well i did have plans for this blog to be all big and angsty today, but i think getting what i wanted in town cheered me up a lot i guess so instead im gonna have a ode to carusoses cafe!  Woot i dunno if youve ever been but i think this is the coolest coffe shop on earth, i mean they sell cookies and juice!  Aswell as the greatest milkshakes in the world!  They have bits of whatever the flavour is in it!  I mean milkshakes with bits of cherry in, how cool is that!     Lol well ive been going for about two years now and its never sold out either, so it truly has to be the goddess of coffe shops!  Also another world is selling a film cell from one of the greates films ever made "The Crow"  YAY!  They are also selling a NBC one, double yay!  Hehe well apart from me really wanting the crow one, this may sound lame to most people but its a piece of history on a plaque!    Lol well sorry if this blogs a little short, there may be more later.  Au revoir.

      Hi everyone  Been a weird day today to say the very least about it, just seems that its just really been a chain of sevral events interlocked.  Its almost as if ive lived about five days inside of one.  Start off with this morning, the usual boredom of Trisha, remembering how long i stayed up till last night (3:00am) looking in my diary just to see how i felt last night then being awoken proply by Trisha's speech about her next show.    Trisha: Have you been caught out? Me: Ehh Ive Just woken up for crying out loud!  Lol my mum set me a task today, using her precious pink sticky post-it notes, when i see one in the morning, i know its something i gotta do, well today it was "Polish the dining room chairs and table."  ... Fucksocks, that polish makes me sneeze.  Then writing down the first part of my story seemed weird while the ever helpful Adam in the background made fun of me, lol very strange experince.  *sigh*  Well anyway that was the end of day 1 so to speak.  Day 2: Me and Bald hammered the living shit out of each other on a mindless computer game, very theroputic, then i took Peter, out and did the usual humming and haring of thinking what im gonna do with the rest of my day.  Day 3:  Went with Mark to school to fetch back his golf trolley... yes i know school *shudder* but there was something so very diffrent about it, it didnt seem like we belonged there anymore, i mean as we walked past Art block which had been pretty much our home away from home for the past 2 years it looked like new.  Not liek the place were we used to chuck food up onto the lights, watch or play frissbe and genraly wile away the lunch hour.  W block was desterted period 5, no year 11's you see.  I mean as i ran past shouting "SAMBI!"  all i got was mr Sutton telling me he was on a course... fucksocks.  Lol well and walking home with a very dodgy off balance golf trolley and a boy with a cane didnt half get some stupid looks from the local old people.  Day 4:  Went up the alotment with my dad to bring a large bucket home to be the fishs tempariry home while we re do the pond, there is something very strange about filling a very large blue bucket with water for the better part of half an hour with watering cans.  Kinda monotanous, but in a strange sense rewarding.  Day:5 Writing this blog.  It has been a weird day.   Cya Ben.  P.S. Found A Great Website Showing What Happens When Artists Have Breakdowns and it can be found  urlLink Here

      Hello All  Well The Ten Weeks of freedom for me began proply today, and i basicly feel overrun.  You know i have all these possibilitys running through my head for these ten weeks, and i want to take advantage of them all but it just seems like its all to much at the moment.  I guess its like i can only take on one thing proply at once at a time, but in ten weeks how do i know i can take on what i want to take on.  I really want to take this time that i have over the next ten weeks to write something, i know that much, but its really hard writing as im sure some of you know, you are just constantly phased by writers block and there are days were everything you seem to write means nothing.  You see, writing is so strange because its not like a question in a test were you can just keep writing and writing when you know a answer,  books ask no questions.  I alos want to have a good time during this ten weeks, you know go out, get pissed see some movies, have a laugh and stuff, but the weather this time challenges me to a duel, and the way that my mind makes me shy towards asking people to do things for me and organizing people to have a good time, it really sucks.  It just seems that every move i want to make will not work at the moment, like when your playing draughts and u know any move you makes gonna get you jumped.  I dunno maybe im just screwed up but i just feel at this time that any move im gonna make is gonna be thwarted.  But hopefully when i finaly charge in and make some moves, its gonna blow the board in two.  But i know that i am gonna attempt to write a story in the ten weeks we got, a proper full scale one, ive had enough attempts now, enough pokes at the jelly fish style dead story on the beach, but now its do or die time at 9:10 tonight it officialy begins.  The first move will be made.  Cya Later Ben

      Greetings!  Woo Today was my last ever exam, and it went really well woot!  I cant believe it, after 5 years of being annoying, pissed off, upset and hell at times even dam right demented its finaly over.  Just think ten weeks of liberation... getting pissed in the park, hanging round town just because you can, drinking milkshakes and eating icecream in carusoes.  Woah.  Like Mark said to me today, "This is probably the biggest break off from any work we will ever have."  Woah, he's right, how very insightful of him.  Hehe well anyway im well chuffed that we are finaly done, squiddled squoddled rocked and rolled all the way out of there woot!    However even though a lot of shit was given at West Park im glad i went, because if i didnt i wouldnt the cast of characters which im proud to call my friends, you know who you all are, and plently of anecdotes were gained just from their exploits.  Hehe i mean who can forget the time we played Ultimate Frissbe in the driving rain, the atmosphere closing in around us like we were in a little frissbe playing world of our own.  Lol or such Great times as Maths with Mr Kavai when we used to play hell every lesson, Chemistry wouldnt have been the same without Tinley Tourettes, The way Me, Adam, Mark and Pat used to ruin our humanity teachers life in year 8 practicly.  Some stuff your just never gonna forget, and i have made some great friends through west park, and i know even though we aint gonna go to the same schools and shit some of us, we will stll see each other, because times like that have a strange habbit of linking people together.  I mean we have all in our own indivual way had a ball, even if we did happen to have this great ball in  one of the suckiest settings on earth, all the way from leaky park road on the first day when we past the big crocodile to Mrs Rollinsons room all the way to last ever chemistry lesson down in the libary, were Jess with a camera made a very embarssing show out of us all.  Lol and leavers assembly all the way through (especialy when kesia sang) me screaming in my head *SHUT UP I WANNA GO DOWN GRAVEL PIT AND GET PISSED!*  Lol we will never forget that day i dont think anyone who was there.  So many memorys, some to embarissing for some people to ever want to recal :P  But anyway, just think what a long way weve came, and we did it, the highs and the lows, the coursework, detentions after school Sambi and Paine.  Lol in the end it was all worth it, because now we come out knowing who we are as people... and who we can trust.  Buildings Burn, People Die, But Friendship lasts forever.  Cya Later Luv Ben

      Hello All!  Well today was spent by me mostly dodging from going to have my hiar cut, i know i know but i really just cant be bothered and hairdressers scare me.  Ohh well so in thisvein of avoidance, Myself, Adam, Mark and Bald set off to hermits cave once again!  Well for those who dont know Hermits cave a is a creepy old cave on dale Abbey that once contained a hermit, not very exciting some thing but when your four lads with nowt better to do, have legs... will adventure.  So as usual our trip envolved the usual mix of rude jokes, complaining that out legs hurt, rude songs "So i pretended that she wasnt a prostitute"  and also songs just because our legs hurt and we are thirsty.  Woot so that envolved such classics as, "If your walking on a road and you know it Punch Bens Arm"  and my particulary Bad version of "Tiny dancer"  its hard to create the bus scene from almost famous when you dont have a bus.  Ohh well anyway thanks to are ability to know were we are going, (we dotn in life but we know how to get to hermits cave)  a cracking time was had by all.  Woot.   Its good being out, kinda takes your mind off things, and after a particulary angsty morning i really was glad of it.  (I missed my bus into town to get a haircut, i woke up feeling depressed and the usual nine yards of angst.)  So it was a good day but as usual because of it im writing this blog while constantly trying to get the hair out of my eyes.  So as my usual sign out, hope everybody who is doing a history exam tommorow aces it, and have a great day... smile and enjoy this gift that was given to you for who knows this could be the only time we truly get to apreciate the quiet things that nobody ever knows :P   "Hold Me Closer Tiny Dancer, Count The Headlights On The Highway, Lay me down in sheets of linen, youve had a busy day today!"  Or alternativly one of mine.  "Made in great germany?"

       urlLink    Yay 100 Blogs!  Yay so a bit of a landmark in my blogitude so i thought id make a bit of a occasion with it with the picture above, and also later on in the post a poem i wrote.  Ohh well before that i think i gotta talk about my reasons for starting this blog in the first place.  Well i guess the original purpose for 'MOAARY' was to have a voice to my own personal feelings that anyone can look at without feeling obliged to listen to it if they didnt want to, which they might have done if id have said this stuff outloud to people.  I guess also it was used to show the diffrent sides of my personality that nobody see's.  This is because i am incredibly shy, and find it hard to express things proply sometimes when im around people who i think their opinion matters.    So this blog became my voice for all my Angst, my feelings, thoughts, qoutes pictures and random stupidity, i guess this is my home on the internet and people can come in anytime they want :p  I also hope that through my blog people can relate to troubles im sure we all have, and id like to think that my blog still strives to help people realize that everybodys individual expression is a brilliant thing, and i hope that every now and then my blog can say something that touchs its readers on a personal level.  Just as writing this blog has helped me out a lot.  Id like to also do a thankyou to everyone who has ever taken the time to read my blog, you have truly helped me out just by listening, because its always comforting to know that even if you feel nobody cares, at least somebody reads about it.  Thankyou very much.  I guess that leads nicely into my poem.     Alpha  I want to keep you all safe I want to show you my worth Give me a pair of wings And be surrounded…embraced Give me a sword Be forever protected Make me the Alpha Make me the guardian Angel Believe in Me.   I guess that poem sums up Angst, a need to be belived in, everyone gives each other their sword and wings, but only you know how to use yours.   So any comments about the Poem will be well recived even if to tell me its shite lol.  I dont really mind.  Its the first poem ive ever shared, so hey i expect it to be crap.  Anyway that doesnt matter, its the thought that counts lol.  And Just To Finish off, and prove that this is still a 16 year old boys post, here is somewhat of a soundtrack to my life at the moment :P  Ben Jeffreys Angst Album Volume 1! .Metallica: Unforgiven .Brand New: Guernica .John Lennon: Working Class Hero .Dave Grohl: Tiny Dancer .Cradle Of Filth: Her Ghost In The Fog .Ivy:Worry About You .Nirvana: The Man Who Sold The World .MUSE: Muscle Museum .Slipknot: Before I Forget  Lol that just about sums it up. Heres to the next 100 My friends. Thankyou for listening Au revoir!    100 Posts!

      Hello All!  Well what can i say, today has been pretty dam uneventful, i made some stupid photoshop piccys,  which can be found  urlLink here  and also  urlLink here   Also carved out some preperation for tommorows 100th blog, woot!  So basicly thats a poem and a piccy, u lucky people you lol.  Well anyway apart from that todays been pretty uneventful, apart from having to fork out for some whiskey and a card for my Dad.   Thus once and for all answering the age old question which is better Daddy or chips?  Lol well Lithiums just come on Kerrang radio, because they've never heard penny royal tea... ohh well not complaining to much because u know... no point lol.  Ohh yeah watched Spinal tap yesterday, it was ok but absoulutly nothing compared to almost famous, which is kinda on a similar vein.  *hums Tiny dancer*  Ohh yeah and if you can get the version of Dave Grohl singing Tiny Dancer your life will be enriched.  Lol it really is that good.    Sigh ohh well i forgot to add one more career ono yesterdays hoard, id say it was one that nobody like us would pass up the chance to and that would be to be a rock star, hehe all i need is some talent lmao.  Woot yeah ive been hideing from that whole careers spear today, im sure some people would say this is due to my 'Paranoia' or some shit, *hums some Sabbath*  Woo, so much for getting in touch with something that people are always trying to kill.    I dunno just seem a bit down tonight, i ant believe this is my 99th blog... so weird.  Hehe well anyway i know lots of lucky people tommorow have their last exam, i mean how cool is that!  So lots of luck to all doing the graphics exam and those who finish with it tommorow poke Sambi in the eye for me :P  Well yeah i guess with kerrang radio becoming more sucky as the night goes on i will end up retreating to my album collection and no doubt listening to the influence for this blog title *sighs thinking how great In Utero is*    Lol well after a very musical, material and mellow blog ima gonna finish with a quoute from this is spinal tap.  Enjoy yourself a lot, all the time.    Or alternativly one of mine.    "Im Blissfully aware of all the pain i give myself."  Au revoir, and goodnight!

      Hello  Been thinking a lot about career lately, and what kind of person im gonna be in college what im gonna do and how im going to affect the world on a much larger scale.  You see because in secondry school it was very easy to affect your enviroment, you know you just had to say something stupid or bring in a whole new idea to who you hung round with and it had a affect.  But i want to make a impression again now, and i know its gonna be harder, i just basicly want to believe ive made a diffrence no matter what miniscule way because i feel if you cant have a positive affect on someones life, why have a life yourself?  It seems that everyone is trying to force this home to me at the moment,  i mean for a starters i enjoy operation programs and shit, anything about illness or Biology i love learning and talking about, my parents pick up on this the other day ask me to concider being in a medical profesion.  Its strange because i always felt that i wanted to do computer graphics like you see in walking with dinosaurs and stuff... but  Over the past to years i got more and more into writing, i mean ive always enjoyed it but two years ago i was told that i can do it.  Interesting really i dont think untill that time ever in my life had i been told i 'Could' do something, and over those to years, the world of computer animation has got less and less interesting to me.  It just seems that sitting in front of a Pc all day dragging and pulling at wire frames like its a extention of your mind finaly grated on me.  I just dont think its art anymore.  I mean now that books and 'Art' movies got into my life in a major way everything is now makeing more sense to me on a more basic level.  I guess cutting people open and saveing someones life links to me a lot more now than dragging stuff that really in the cold light of reality is fake across a screen.  I guess the more artsy side of me apeals to my strange habbits about Charity.  I mean if u have ever been to town with me you will know sometimes i just blatanly ignore charitys and shit, but things that really matter, i have to give.   Its strange really.  But i dont think its for me, i just couldnt think i could learn like that, careers are just confusing.  Theres just so much that gets in my way when i think about 'what career suits me'  I guess my dream job would to be a author, but its the worry of if its possible, and if it keeps you alive.  Just basic things.  But really careers are not important.  Its people that are the real key.  Ive seen a lot of press and talk about charitys lately, now this is something i want to get envolved in.    For instance, i have seen a lot of medical stuff in my time, around here, hospitals and stuff i just dont really wanna talk about but it helped me reallys some very basic things are almost our duty to do.  Such as giving blood.  This i believe is one of the most influential things i will ever end up doing on this earth.  It is so important because of its basisity, i mean for instance 1000's of people everyday need blood in accidents and surgery and so on, now if peopel stoped giving blood, people who need basic operations who would otherwise survive would die.  All because some people wouldnt dare have half an hour on their back giving blood.  It doesnt make any sense to me, and i know for one the second i can i will do this.  I guess what i could say is that my thoughts about future life are suffering from a bit of a 'renaissance' its very strange, and im still confused but i know no matter what my carrer is i can affect this world in as simple ways as giving blood, and that makes me feel good.   Ohh well in other news, ive been looking at this website about urban legends about creatures around the world, its really some quite interesting shit, worth a laugh if u into all the paranormal and that like i am, (yes i know i used to watch the X-files a lot so shoot me)   urlLink American Monsters   So enjoy that, and to conclude ive gathered a list of Jobs id like to be when i finaly go out into it, (Yup some of them are jokes but id love it)  .Surgeon (err i dunno) .Film Director .Author .Freelance Cryptoligist (lol Monster Hunter) .Paranormal Investigator (Everybody *hum hum hum hum he hum*)  Lol thanks for listening to Ben Jeffreys Bad Asse Angst Song.  Au revoir.

      Hello All  Nothing like a morning blog to get you going, and as i despretly try to force my brain into doing some creative photoshop picture takeing the piss out of something or other ive been dodging round the internet looking at random stuff, which is a bit boring.  However while i was despretly trying to download music by panic cell (which later failed)  i did find this  urlLink Its a heartwarming story of a guy who made a shell for his computer entirley out of pumpkins.   Well not a lot has gone on at the moment, and its well boring, probably gonna go on MSN as soon as i can figure out what picture ima gonna do :(    Ohh well at least i managed to write up one of my poems on word, now all i need to do is to blackmail Joe Robson into *cough* lending me one of his angel drawings and i got gold!  Woot well err seeing as ive mentioned him here is his website    urlLink Newneojoe   Well talk to you later when i got something to say.

      Greetings!  Yay late blog tonight, yeah lol well the day did get slightly worse, mainly due to the fact hardly anyone was on line which sucked a bit.  Ohh well.  Well Joe T did come on and we had our usual verbal sparing match, he concluded that im Paranoid and Obsessive... hmm not sure about the obsessive bit myself, felt it was a bit harsh, but i do understand the Paranoid bit, i really do.  He quoted this to me...paranoia is a irrational fear or irritation by something that u feel is connected deeper than it is.  Yeah that sums it up i guess, im so crazy... and hmm highlighting it didnt do much for my mood really.  Grr my mum shouldnt have told me i could finish up the rum,its gonna be so gone by the time this blog is done.  Yeah well anway it leads me onto another point... people who dont get Angsty.  Lol just like hmm really, his quote was "i dont care about hidden meanings and shit"  Lol that about sums it up really.  Yeah i also told him that hidden meanings are really just a person begging to talk about something close to them but they cant share it unless its found, yup thats angst.  They should be more people who should understand this fact, i mean if i wasnt so willing to take the piss out of myself all the time id be well pissed off with what he just said to me.  Ehh i dunno maybe its just the drink talking but i doubt it, just a shame not more people were on to talk about it, beign told ur mental before bedtime dont help very much :S  Well if i carry on like this ima gonna start repeating myself so im just gonna simply sum it by saying.  Angst isnt a Mental Disorder, its just a way with dealing with things.  I guess im just searching for The Quiet Things That Nobody Ever Knows.  Goodnight.

I got up an hour ago and its strange because i feel ok, almost i dunno happy, and i owe that to some of the people i talked to last night and the things they said and did, thanx for that :P  Well anyway on with today!  Yeah well at the moment i got Kerrang radio on which can be found  urlLink Here!   Woot if your lucky they play a good track, lol but at the moment i think they like playing the Rasmus just to piss me off.  Ohh well at the moment im listening to a lot of Brand New, with a recomendation from Amber, i know its not my usual afair of loud rawkus noise, like SOAD or Slipknot but i dunno makes a change lol!  Woot i wouldnt say its for everyone and Bald will probably skits about it but hey, i will listen to anythign once and it pays off to do that i feel.    Hehe i wish i had more rememberance of the insightfulness of some people last night, i guess they just kinda made me believe again in stuff, lol i did have a bit of a panicy anyursm, so Thanku Adam and Amber for that!  Woot anyway its great feeling alright today, lol makes a change you know.  So err GOURANGA!  Lol hehe well anyway once again on with this big ol blog show.  Id just like to wish everyone shit loads of luck with their R.S. exam today, i mean lets be realistic, its gonna be fucking annoying, but just smile and get through it because if i c naturally happy people breaking down, im paying a visit to the nearest cliff :P  Hehe well just do ur best and when youve done look Mr Paine square in the eye and give a resounding "Go Roger urself u fucking Pedo!"  Ohh how he will laugh!  Ohh fuck Linkin Park's just came on Kerrang radio, thats the one thing u have to beware of, along with the Rasmus, *cough Bald*  Hehe Heres a list of shit thats kept me sane!  .Friends, (Their very insightful when they want to be *cough Adam* .Laughing at Religion .Juice .Laughing at how Bad the Rasmus are .GOURANGA  Hmm after thought! ~On sticking a fork up the lead singer of the Rasmus's arse he was remarked to say "AH!

      Hello All.  Been a shit day today, im sure lots of you know, or perhaps you dont those days were you wake up depressed, and you think hmm fuck it i will be ok later... but your not and your still pissed off and you feel everyones getting to you.  Yeah welcome to my day.  I looked up all the psychology papers that wer eplaced on the internet today about Teenage Angst just all bullshit about parents worried about their kids and how they try to sum up your whole entire mind about who you are makeing you a good little consumer again.  It destroys thousands of talented people everyday.  But what they fail to realize Angst is not just over nothing at all, its a way of comprehending how you see yourself and i would say just a attempt before the world breaks you to get yourself heard.  Angst is fueled by death ears.  I dunno, well mainly i was thinking about my lack of understanding towards things today, they way i always ask people whats wrong with me, why dont i know... its strange really, i even tried talking to my mother... she wasnt listening so i told her she can shove her head up her arse.  Nice arent i.  I dunno i jsut have taken to increasingly stareing at myself for longer Periods of time when im not on here writeing away on some story that i thinks cool but nobodys ever paid any interest in, it would also help if i had some talent and i could spell.  My sister has always kinda been my insperation in things, but now i c her as a author, *she's writing a big ol novel and doing really well*  and then i see me, with my shoddy Confessions of a 21st century vampire not worth the paper its not written on.  She's happy aswell, im not, i saw her Teenage life through the eyes of a child, the rows, the times the dress sense, she always summed up how cool it was to be a teenager.  But hey she didnt tell me she was gonna give me a world of Angst aswell.  Stuff hurts you know, when trying to be urself doesnt seem good enough for anyone, when you can talk to someone for hours on end and still feel like they made no connection to you, even though you make a connection to them.  My dress sense, my music, my writing my own mind that was influenced by my sister when i was growing up, (yes i know it sounds weird but their are some family things id rather keep to myself) it all seemed so cool back then, when my sister gave me my first Album... Nirvana Nevermind.  It all seemed so cool and liberated back then but nobody ever told me with that you'd get a lot of shit days were everyone hates you for not being normal.  Also because ive always been told in my family and these are my mothers exact words "Never be normal" i feel i dont fit into anything.  I guess with my parents being quite old im inept at feelings and shit, yeah i guess thats right, i do feel inept.  I cannot tell anyone how i feel without spinning it out for days on end, i have to get other people to start conversations because im to fucking shy to just ask someone "What music you like?"  or any basic shit like that.  This feeling of worthlessness does colide horribly with the days as im sure everyone gets were you feel fucking invincible, lol like the gillete advert thats on at the moment, were everything you do affects the world, but when you feel like me, it hurts all the more on those days when you find its not true.  Now it comes to the blog, this is always ridiculeing the basic fact.  I cannot communicate proply, its obvious when you write em all down in a middle man, and people reading it cannot link it to you because its so aloof from yourself.  They cant here me in real life saying these things, i wish they could but i cant do it, im just inept.  Id like to finish with a quote a very good friend of mine says, and it makes sense "I like to think im useless in everyway"  Thx for reading, goodnight.

      Greetings  Blog two of the day and i was just wondering what its all about really, u know i realy think they shouldnt give me days off because i think to much.  It just seems that people no matter how innocent they seem to be they are out to hurt me at the moment.  It seems very odd really, almost like the powers of be hate me beign nice and want to punish me for this.  Seems odd really that, but i can imagine whoeevr made all this would in some aspects have to be a pretty stone cold, power hungry nonce.  Lol you know, it just seems that im once again encountering Karmatic black holes at the moment, you know the way you would say do a good deed and instead of life repaying it back unto you it is sucked into a black hole and destroyed forever.  In the end i always end up hammering this, while my own mind laughs at me.  Another thing thats been bothering me at the moment is the way i convince myself of something to be one way, when really its compleatly the other way!  And any attempts to try to to trick this train of thought end up with it becomign even more confused and screwed up.  It just seems like my own mind comes out to get me sometimes.  Thats the problem, i think im paranoid, basicly in essence this means you believe that everyones out to get you.  I guess the only cure is to get peopel to tell you their not, but i dunno maybe they are :S  and every time i talk about it i confuse myself.  Maybe i should just shut up but sometimes i dunno, just need telling that im not off my trolley lol.                             what I've felt                           what I've known                           never shined through in what I've shown                           never be                           never see                           won't see what might have been                            what I've felt                           what I've known                           never shined through in what I've shown                           never free                           never me                           so I dub the unforgiven                            you labeled me                           I'll label you                            so I dub the unforgiven   Sha fucking Zam That was another Angst filled blog Ive Been Ben Jeffrey Youve Been my lovely readers, Love you all  P.s.  Au revoir and plz visit us at  urlLink Woa   Because Bald has worked Hard on that site and ima gonna put a story on it soon, so even if u dont like what you see just tell us on our forum, you know id do it for you.  *A personal thanku to whoever read this, because writing is important to me and if you took time to read it all power to you."

      Greetings the folk of my blog.  Yay i had a exam free day today so woots a plenty there!  Hehe but as usual i didnt do a lot with it, just wandered round town... ho hum.  Hehe well anyway hope you all had a good day today whatever you did im sure it was worthwhile!  Yeah well anyway i was just thinking about how tragic everything really is if you think about it and how saying Gouranga really doesnt help.  Yup its the monks again, weird folk arent they... always happy, lol well they were helping children and handing out stickers today so i obliged, listen to SOAD long enough and i challenge you not to feel sorry for the children :P  Well anyway they preach the whole idea of Gouranga and be happy for thsoe of you who dont know... i mean im sorry i just dont get being happy, got nothing to be happy about im sure even fairys commit suicide.  Poor things :s  Lol well especialy if the head fairy was a cock muncher ruining lifes, yeah just Blair and his dancing spin poneys of polatics... Wankers.

      Hi All  Hey just had a uber boring but all right history exam now... yeah typical boring near end to a typicaly boring 5 years of work.  Ive been thinking about school life quite a lot at the moment, and how deeply flawed school is, i mean the preps are loved by teachers, peopel like us are hated, people who deserve better get treated by shit everyday of their school life by people who are future shit shovelers.  School all the way through pushes opinions in your face.  R.S. beign a typical example of how biggoted views of our country and religion are placed in your face.  Typical quote of a RS teacher "You Know religion is silly but CHRISTIANITY IS THE TRUE RELIGION!"...Fuckers.  I mean they constantly try to get the latest tinsel town polatics down your throat and chew.  Its shite people are everyday forced to think like biggots.... yeah become your parents!  I mean WTF!    Uniforms aswell now this ive always thought was well feeble, i mean they say "It discourages bullying"  Yeah bullshit, if people are gonan insult you for what you wear, they gonna do it any way, Uniform is used to try to rob people of their identity.  But of cours trying to show your identity can get you in trouble, unless your a prep of course then the teachers have nothign but encouragement for you!  Yes i will give you more time for your homework prep:.V.013249 Yes i will ignore you as you ruin something of someone elses to validate your misrable life. Yes do what you fucking like just as long as when you leave school you neevr have a thought that hasnt been infulenece by something uve seen on TV and be a good little consumer.  I mean the facts are hidden from us at school, the school shits abotu buying kareoke machines and crappy plastic cafe's to encourage the consumer within while all the stuff used for actually learnign something to get out of this shit hole is slowly falling to bits.  "Ohh sorry their is only 1 text book between 5 i burnt em to fuel our refigerators in  the hall.  School is quite frankly constantly trying to rob your opinion off you and replace it with a nice big placebo.  Yeah welcome to the real world boys and girls!  Your not number 1, Everyone is against you, You cant go around delibratly ruining others lifes to validate your own feeble existance, you WILL die one day.  But you see school hides these facts from you so you will be shell shocked into being a good little consumer when you enter the real world.  Id like to sum up this Angst filled slice with this.  "Remember Nothing You Buy In This Life Is Real"     Thankyou for listening.

      Hello all!  Heya all, its been a very exam orientated day today :S  and yeah the double wammy of Science and English did suck. A lot!  The English paper was not only boring but the only question i said i was gonna do (describe) was about a shopping centre... thx for that grr.  Well anyway i hope you all did a good job and be proud of yourself have a biscuit play this game!   urlLink Draw to tidy stuff up!   I swear its so cool you have to tidy up all these messy little critters by drawing!  YAY!  Lol well anyway on with the show.  Yeah well the one thing thats got to me so far today was little tiny events that keep replaying in your mind, they kinda repeat because they seem special to you but really they just gonna eventually break your mind into a million pieces all over the floor.  Ive got two of them to deal with today... how sucky is that!  I mean they seem cool when they happen but the more you think about them they wear at you, make you want to do something about something thats already... BUT BANG!  its to fucking late!  Ohh well i guess i just have to w8 for the next one!  (If There is one :S)  Well as to not break my usual blogging style bring on the stuff!  The Stuff Thats Stopped Things Breaking My Sanity like so much communion bread.  .Laughing at Transubstansiation .Juice and lots of it .SOAD's 3rd album (Cant w8 till the fourth!) .All the Folk Who read my blog   Hurrah for all those things!  Hmm strange all the lads in our school (me included funny enough) recieved a incredibly small pair of fake testicles today... how odd.  Hmm so remember lads check for testiclular cancer!  (Any preps who read this check ur own balls not the plastic ones!) lmao  So anyway that was sufficently weird... if they wernt so gross id safety pin em to my bag and take em to school.  But they are just a little bit to gross... hmm maybe i will just throw em at a car.  Ohh well anyway bubye love you all and thanks for all the fish.

      Greetings.  Ive been askign myself this quite a lot lately.  Its odd really, ud think id be able to tell the diffrence.  But i dunno, just the dreams have been so vivid, it almost begs the point of does it really matter?  I guess i live in a fantasy world of thinking people care lol.  I dunno my life just feels like cereal... bite sized chunks   Dreams are odd monkeys indeed, i mean what is the point in them, what are they really trying to tell you... if anything at all?  I mean are dreams really just a way of figuring things out, or are they really ur base emotions... i dont know they just seem to tell a story that runs parrel to my life at the moment vry odd shit.  And sometimes Life feels like a dream, and it hurts all the more when reality comes back.  Lol odd that.  Ohh well today has been pretty dam uneventful, lots of talk of boring old football, and a shamefull display by England in the last two mins.  Hehe so funny.  Ohh well im not unpatriotic, just think that if we gonna play to that standard and talk so much bullshit its only karama that England get owned in such a fashion.  Ohh well im done good luck with all your exams tommorow, cya!

      Greetings  heya this is my first blog of the day and im already pissed with all this England shit,  i mean if we win i will be shocked and for some reason some people think that by winning some pointless tournament that makes a great nation.  Err no i doubt it very much.    I mean David Beckham is not a hero... he has never fought in a war to create a ego for a mad man.  He has never through his sport saved a life or helped someone when they needed it.  If anything Euro 2004 has enslaved people due to our own selfishness.  I mean flags on cars... Made in China were a worker gets the equivlent on £64 a month to make flags all day.  Ohh yeah how pleasant.  Football does not make us a great nation, our ability to kick a bag of wind about does not make us all powerful.  People dont associate Flags with England as a country and with freedom anymore.  They associate it with 11 men who kick a bag of wind about a pitch.  This is insane.    Football has became more than a game... it enslaves countrys and there people, sells newspapers, creates gods out of men, desecrates a flag with JJB, ruins something thats ours.

      greetings!    Hello everyone who btohers to read this shoddy corner of the internet i hope today see's you well and you have all had a good time today!  Well anyway cut to the chase... the moral of todays story is i shouldnt be aloud to think by myself for to long... i have been thinking to much today and have came home a bit worse for were.  Yeah its the usual Angst, its boiled over and my blog needs to be shamelessly verbaly raped with it.  So here goes.  I was just thinking about myself and how myself links in with others.  Now i have always i guess since i was about seven felt that i never quite fit in to anything, and of course this has to be my fault but ive neevr quite figured out why.  Its odd really how everythings boiled down to such simple chemical signals in your brain yet it takes so long to put down.  You know i think it was Bald who once said to me "If its to weird to write down its put in music"  It was a odd quote but it does ring true, kinda links to my "All great art is based on suffering" theme.  However this isnt great art... this is just me saying how i feel in the only way i can.  I guess i suck at expressing feelings to others, i dont know why it is, i just always feel people are judgeing me... they probably are i guess.    Its hard to say you dont care when you do.  I dunno how i feel about anything anymore.  Its just strange for instance after i got laid out yesterday in front of all my mates, i have never felt so bad... but it wasnt because this dude had just punched me in the face... no much more than that really.  I guess it was the fact that i linked to me being owned as me ruining the party.  I know it was quite obviously this twats fault, but yet again i felt it was mine... so odd really.  The second thing that came into my mind was the old feeling of beign outcasted.  I guess on its sad base form, my friends that i was with then are quite frankly my best mates in the whole fucking world, and i was just made to look like a prick in front of em... sad but true i know.  Pride, yeah i guess that was one of em, im always so cocky, always telling jokes being a twat basicly and this guy just twated me, owned me... base form, of being a lad... 9 years at karate and i didnt see one punch... just one.  The punch itself didnt hurt, the symbolism did, ive never probably felt so bad in my whole life as i did after that.  I put on a brave face and smile though, the old jokes on the txt message and that wank, but i am honest now.  (Lol you'd think im done but im not)  But also there is another thing that has really reflected on me, what a incredibly idiot i am.  I mean ive always tried to be there for people, yet i miss things, blind obvious things, i know there is something wrong with people, but i neevr know waht to say... because of my selfish idea of being judged and hurt.  Ive always hated being hurt in the mental sense.  That reflects on the Punching, my body doesnt hurt, i dont give a fuck about it... but im deadly afraid of painful emotion.  Its kinda sad in its simplest form and anyone who reads this will probably neevr look at me the same again... but i had to say it simple as that.  Thankyou for listening, ive been very honest today i feel.  Goodnight.

      Greetings Mortals Who Live In My Blog!  Well the 1st graphics exam is now over, and i told Sambi just how i feel about his exam.  "I Blame You."  I think were my exact words to him, i hope it made him think... or possibly even cry!  Lol well anyway that exam was UBER Confusing, Super Hard and pointless, yup its just been one of those exams im afraid.  Anyway in other nu's once that horrific event we gathered a small frissbe playign crew to adventure down gravel pit.  So finaly after much male bonding by "Who can climb the biggest tree"  and "Who hurt themselfs the most"  we finaly decided to head on home.  Well what can i say, it may have been childish but it wasnt half fun!  Hehe well anyway i hope today see's all my readers well and they all having a good time in their own little lifes!    Now on with the show!  Yeah i was thinking about how other people view you, and the world around them today, having a good laugh with myself thinking about everyones diffrent approachs to each other and shit, and how people treat people diffrently in diffrent circumstances.  Very long winded stuff and i say you have to have a lot of time on your hands like me to think about it!  You know because i was thinking about how diffrent people will see diffrent things in this blog and just think for a moment if you dare.  How do you see the world?  Lol well anyway enough pondering thought im off!    Au revoir

      Hello everyone  Yup just like the title says, today was to Uber hot, and i feel sick.  Great.  Lol you'd think that venus moving in front of the sun would maybe cool it down just the tinyest of bits but alas.  Lol well anyway on the exam front i had a wrist slitting four hours of Maths and Business, (shudder stuck in a IT room for two hours in the boiling heat with people who i swear dont wash)  lol well thank god thats over.  Tommorow i got the horrific wedding ring vomiting exam that is Graphics :(    So good luck to us all, i think we gonna need it.  Anyway i hope you all had a nice day today and you have managed to stop yourself from going insane in the heat!  That part didnt bother me much because i probably already am insane.    In other nu's i also got some more batterys for my camera so i can take shots of stuff, make look angsty and put em on MSN for all to boggle at yay!  Well anyway i guess that doesnt really matter but i think its cool :p  So once again a depressing day has reached its twighlight hours, and the sun still refuses to stop shining *stupid thing* and im still toying with the idea of going into Audio blogging from my phone, its free now so they announce!  Hmm well something to think about if you my precious viewers can stand to hear my boring voice yammering on about Angst!   Just when you thought reading was enough!  Au revoir

Well enjoy, and i guess we all feel like that sometimes standing on that hill looking out at the darkened graves. But i think we are all looking for something like Jack was looking for Sally and Sally was looking for Jack just something we can say is worthwhile and alive.    I dunno maybe its just the Angst talking but id like to think we can all find something to hold on to when we are like that... u know feeling dead inside.    Goodnight.

      Hello Ladies and Gentlemen who live in my blog!  I hope today finds you well and that you all did a cracking job in your exams today, im sure you did and if your worried havea cookie and smile!  Lol well anyway today it has once again been to hot and hammering frissbe after exams for 1 and a bit hours aint advisable in that heat :P  Few!  But hey today i was thinking about how things can be so easily ruined and how one persons actions can affect so many.  Its really annoying really because these people float aimlessly through there lives trying to validate there excistance by insulting and hurting others just so they can believe that they've had a affect on someone in their misrable lifes.  Those people piss me off sooooo much, if you see one today stab them!  You see ive always believed in what you do someone is reflected back on you, but when people break these rules and they seem to never reap what they sow, or repay unto you, it kinda shakes your ability to have faith in humanity.  Ohh well not that i ever had much anyway :p  Yeah well carrying on away from Karmatic Black hole people *whistles Black hole sun*  i do believe that the following things kept me entertained today!  .ASDA Hot sausage :P YUM .Frissbe! .The possibility of future treehouse building *AKA Me and Adam entertaining a dream* .The People who live in my blog!  Woot well anyway my semi optamisim is wearing off so bubye!

      Greetings Mortals!  Heya i felt i had to blog now or i ould possibly never be able to blog again, it just seemed like a do or die moment because a urge has taken me and they are important!  You know when your mind suddenly almost seems to twitch and you get the feeling that you really want to do something in particular?  Well i was just wondering why some people ignore them, its strange really.  Now i want to share something with you all which i find quite insightful.  All of the people who read this are each brilliant in there own individual way.  You may be exelent speakers,  Authors, Artists, musicians what have you.  But i know how it feels, you create something and you tell yourself "This is the biggest load of SHITE!"  But stop before you destroy it (Im one to talk i know *shudders*)  Keep your work, and show it to someone, they will apreciate it.  Because i have come to learn something over the past week.  Nothing is trivial, nothing that you create is rubbish, it is art my friends.  Now im makeing a pact to myself and you all now that i will never destroy another piece of work that i create ever again and i will happily look or listen or see anything that you have done yourselfs if you want to share.  Art is a very personal thing, but showing your skill to another is liberation.  Id like to finish by just saying one thing about Urges  "If you dont follow Urges there is no point having em"  Thankyou for listening, and be brave, your work is not crap, its brilliant.

      Greetings  Im in a bit of a down mood today, my family has been pissing me off and with us alll being together and me having to be in the same room has them has generated something close to cabin fever.  Yes it is Uber boring!  Well anyway  i hope everyones having a great time back home, and that the inpending exams arent giving them to much hastle!  Well anyway on with the show!    I think this may be my last holiday to Perranporth which fills me with mixed feelings really, I mean so far this place has yet to inspire me so as always my poetry and writing goes un written.  Lol which probably to most people is a good thing.  Also i dont think i can stand to go with my parents because they are to old and annoying at times and sometimes it really pisses me off.    I miss everybody loads aswell and normaly the holiday would take my mind off this but of course this time its not.  This blog i guess is now my last refuge of my minds thoughts after i do believe my Diary was plundered this morning by my gimp Parents!  I mean wtf do they think they are playing at!    I have to go for a 'Meal' with them tonight, believe me in my head i will be somewere else, somewere far away!  Lol probably just imagining something and i will have fun for ages until i remind myself its not real and i tell myself how crazy i am!  Hehe well if anyone still reads this they will know that i am in fact a crazy unconsolable wannabe Vampire, pointless waste of air!  Yeah well one good point today is i went to Newquay Zoo and i love it there.  The animals are super cool.  Feel sorry for the Lions though, there cage is to small, i dont like looking at the lions, They reminded me to much of my present situation in that moldy old shack they call a holiday apartment.  Yeah things appear to be getting worse here.    Plus it sucks because at the moment im watching my time at the internet cafe slowy rot away and i know i can only get away from my parents for another hour over the next few days without just going and being incredibly boring :s  GRRRR!    Well anyway i hope everyones having a great time back home, hope the weather picks up for you and you all enjoy it!  Thx for listening   Miss you all lots.  Benjamin Jeffrey.

      Greetings mortals.  Well i spent most of my day today with my dad on a boat fishing today... it wasnt that bad actually, we caught a few fish had a few laughs all that kinda stuff, but it was also the usual fishing syndrome. A lot of time to think... and i mean a lot. Now i know probably nobody who reads this has ever gone fly fishing before, so basicly for you lot, u spend a long time doing not a lot. Just waiting, repativly fishing in and out, trying diffrent techniques... till finaly BANG the fish hits your fly pull it in pull out the reaper (or not if you catching and releasing) then wack bang food to eat.  Ohh well but as you can see while your waiting to kill, you have a lot of time to just think about everything, so i always come back angsty, and you know arr! I just dotn know what to think or how to deal with it at the moment, good job im a expert at forgeting things, its the only way really when nobody will face you when you need them to.  But anyway i just cant think of much to say really but im just drinking Rum till my mum wont let me anymore. Meh.  I apologise for the length.  Ben.

      Hello everyone!   Woo yeah nothing like the smell of fresh blog in the morning!&nbsp; Well anyway this is one of my early posts so by now i can imagine you all know this is not about a lot!   Well anyway for those who are still interested ima gonna be doing a new update for my website over the next few days, but the only problem is i have absoulutly no idea what ima gonna do for the website, i just appear to have ran out of ideas.&nbsp; Lol i would add some more poems, but the problem is i havent done any i really like recently, also i still havent edited my short story, The named 'Ressurection Men' until Mark reminded me that there is already a book named that, and he also says its rather good.   But anyway i tink thats to much work to close to a deadline ive set myself, so if anyone has any ideas that theyd wanna share, plz chat to me on MSN about it, leave me a comment, or sign my guestbook my website.&nbsp; Thankyou very much for that.   Ben.

      Hello everyone.  Yup been one of those 'Low' days today, were you aint depressed as in a sense is you cant handle the problems that come at you, rather a day were you wonder things like Why, if and how.&nbsp; I dunno ive just been thinking a lot today about all the stuff i appaear to have cocked up dramaticly of late and i was wondering how these things could have played out diffrently, i guess thats were the title comes from.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know your always told that you cannot undo what has been done, you cant forget the past, if you dont know why somethings happened you'd better find out.&nbsp; All that kind of stuff, well i dont know why they tell you this because its not as if you dont know.  Even when they do tell you, people still try to anyway, even if it will make them look more stupid they are still gonna try.&nbsp; Im still gonna try, ive never seen the point in just not bothering, i rather see it as when to bother, but nobody can tell you that.  I just feel like a lot of stuff thats gone off at late is broken, been sent out of my sites, before it can be fixed, and thats what annoys me, but even if i have to set the whole production line back to zero, im gonna mend that one broken pot.&nbsp;  But how do you mend it?&nbsp; As ive said... never been a wise man.

      Greetings.   Woo yay ive had a duff day, lol one of the worst days ive had for quite a while really, it was jsut really boring, pointless, and my old MSN account got hacked by some random twat who i have a hunch has sent out some horrid emails to people.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; so it really wasnt me.&nbsp; So all of you who read this blog and i know because ive seen you in real life will have a nice little invite to talk to me once again on my pretty clean multicoloured Gmail account.   Woo well anyway still feel uber down today but theirs not a lot i can do about that, it almost seems out of my hands, you know almost as if somethings been taken from me and i cant seem to get it back.&nbsp; Plus im super pissed with this hacker person because it seems its someone i know... its just the way they operate and the things this twat has said to people.&nbsp; Its just unfair why cant they just tell me what their problem is to my face instead.&nbsp; I dunno i just feel hated for the wrong reasons at times.   Also there is a lot of shit that i want to talk about to a lot of people at the moment, you know tell em whats on my mind, so i dont have to be in my shell and shy about anythng anymore, but i cant find the words to say it and some people dont have the time to listen to it.&nbsp; I just wish i wasnt so shy and so fucking afraid of reality most of the time, im just annoyed with myself that i seem to have no control over my own destiny, i feel as if everything has been taken from my hands.   I dunno, just sick of it at the moment, just need forget everything.  Thanks for listening  Ben.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Greetings everyone.   Sorry i havent blogged earlier today, it just appears to have been one of those things really, like so much else thats gone off of late.&nbsp; I mean late last nigth i found out someone hacked my MSN account to send a mean email to someone, which rather pissed me off (if anyone else has recived one of those emails it was not from me and i do hope that you didnt believe it was)   Yeah well anyway todays been a bit Angsty because everything seems to suck at the moment its like im talking in a language other people dont understand and i seem to be somehow outcasting myself again... its not fair and really sucks because i honestly dont know whats happened or what ive done wrong it just seems like something broke without me noticing.&nbsp; I wish i knew what was wrong but i dont and no matter what i do i cant seem to be able to find out without having to do something drastic.   But if i have to i will.&nbsp; Its just one of those quiet things that nobody ever knows... but i want to know.&nbsp; But i dont know if it will let me.&nbsp; I guess i&nbsp;kinda feel emotionaly blacked out you know, like everyone is enjoying something that i want but i cant get it, like im not worthy, or not good enough to get&nbsp;it.&nbsp;  *sigh* i dont know what to do, i just feel alonesy.  Ben.

      Hi all  So you really want to know the story of my day?&nbsp; Well i warn you it isnt one for the faint hearted.&nbsp; It was fucking boring thats why!&nbsp; Arr!&nbsp; I seriously cant believe how very little i have to say today, basicly all ive been doing is thinking.&nbsp; Which for me is a very very dangerous activity.&nbsp; I dunno maybe im just good at pissing myself off but i feel really down at the moment, just nothing seems to work, nothing seems worth bothering with because anything i do take a interest in kicks me in the face.  Woo well anyway plus i havent sat down and wrote anything since i finished 'Ressurection&nbsp; men'&nbsp; which seems ten days ago, but i really have no idea because time seems to have no meaning its rather just a sequence of events glued together by the night sky and little neon lights.&nbsp; *Shakes head* meh, i dunno just feel ARRR!&nbsp; Feel like i want to just sit in a corner and die but on the same time want to totaly rock and roll destroy shit.  I dunno maybe im just going that little bit closer to a nervous break down, i bet there quite fun really, in a abstract kinda way.&nbsp; All these thoughts get in my brian and they just push to get out, its driving me rather maaaaaad i think.  Ohh well i fancy writing another 'Make your own adventure thing for the blog so here goes.'    Your Name is   Pus Boy/ Pterodactyl girl    Your Arch Nemisis is   Yourself/Some kinda Anti Matter Blob/The goverment    Your Arch Nemisis killed your   Bf Or Gf/The Queen/Your Fave Band/Mittens the singing sock puppet    You fight your Arch Nemisis   On top of a mountain in the driving rain/ On a Train/ Your house/ Alternate dimension/ In a vat of Tomato Sauce    Your power that gives you a edge is   Your stunning Looks/The power of flight/Smelly socks/A gun    How it all ends   Tragicly/Happy ending/Wait for the sequal?  Make your own adventure.&nbsp; Woo cya Ben.

      Hi everyone   Hope you all had a good day today and enjoyed this good weather that we are having... SHOCK HORROR!&nbsp; Lol well anyway today Ben has been doing a lot of Dusting and dances with hoovers, which sucks quite a lot (my mum wanted me to clean the whole house over)&nbsp;&nbsp; *Sigh* so anyway i made the most of it by cleaning to the tune of The Origin Of Symmetry album by MUSE and i tell you now that polishing a large table to the tune Of New Born and Bliss is a very odd experince indeed&nbsp; "Destroy the spineless Tell me its real!"&nbsp; lol very odd indeed.   Woo well anyway todays just been one of those days aswell so far were everything seems to be incredibly pointless and every word that comes out of your mouth total crap and you think that everyone knows how much bullshit your talking... now thats annoying.&nbsp; Also annoyed that for some reason unknown the twats at my bank decided it would be a jolly good jape to send me a bank statement this month missing about £6 for reasons unknown, so anyway after having a rather annoying call to the bank i final managed to get that rectified because some twating thing had gone wrong, but that was only after i had to suffer some pre mature prick named steven for about 20 mins.&nbsp; *sigh*   So err plently of normal just plain life angst today such as annoying banks and people ringign from deeply weird electrical companys called Shelldon.&nbsp; Then being repeativley laughed at doesnt help even though i probably deserved it because i was wittering on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohh well one appaears to be going mad of late plus ive set myself yet more tasks to do and its driving me a bit mad, somebody do me a favour knock me out or take me out and spoil me or kill me or something just stop my mind from working.&nbsp;  Bubye.

      Hiya all  Ohh dear Ben's writing a late night blog, turn away now all of a nervous disposition.  Yup well youve been warned ive worked some angst to the surface and now its gonna come out in a readable format.&nbsp; Life at the moment seems so stale and dry, like its lost all meaning because my mind becomes more and more consumed by things i want but cant have.&nbsp; The way little things seems to bother me is urging on the scarey now, i cant seem to be able to think straight anymore.&nbsp; Its like there is something in the way i cannot hope to break.  But ohh no it cant possibly be it for angst tactics change you see.&nbsp; Sometimes when your with people and your talking, getting a long like a house on fire its like woo yeah hoopla ive cracked it im finaly starting to get somewere, and then its like next time you talk to them, you expect a open door to come in talk have fun hell maybe even smile, but no the locks have changed again.&nbsp; Makes you wonder why that happens, people invite you in with one hand and drive you out with a crucifix in there other hand or something.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean what is with this notion i keep feeling that somehow people think themselfs i dont know i wouldnt say better than me but rather that because of who they are they cannot ever fully accept me.&nbsp;   Its strange i see it everyday that people wont accept each other unless they fit perfectly into their lifes already.&nbsp; I dont know i just feel like i dont fit sometimes and my attempts to are so vain and pointless i might aswell not even try to.&nbsp; But you see this is were the true edge is found that just when you want to give up, say fuck it all forget it you aint never gonna burn my heart out all that bullshit people invite you back in.&nbsp; You enjoy urself for a while and the next day cast out thus apealing to the instinct to fight for what you want.&nbsp;   Something has gotta break in these patterns and they just seem like they wont, they just a permanant and welded together, unstopable, unending , infinate.  You get so many conflicting messages the whole time, sorting through them is a pain i mean if sevral diffrent factors give you sevral diffrent factors but your only aloud to use one, how can u possibly decide you know, yes you test.&nbsp; You see whats gonna be the best course of action but when you arent aloud to test you feel as if you might just drop it all and go live in a hole.&nbsp; Im just sick of not being able to say exactly waht i feel, i dont want to risk anything that is worth keeping but at the same time id want to risk it just to get what you truly want.  Fortune favours the brave they say. Carpe Dium is what they yell. But they dont understand that saying is very far away from doing it.  Goodnight. Ben.

      Hi everyone!  Well its that time of day were i once again get my blog on woo.&nbsp; Well anyway i hope everyones had a cool day today and im glad i finaly got my wish of it thundering woo yay hoopla!&nbsp;However the only draw back to this was that it cut the signal to sky in the last te minutes of one of my fave Buffy episodes ever!&nbsp; Dammit, lol and if you were interested which on it was it was part one of were Angel trys to end the world using the big stone demon.  Woo for any of those who do not speak Buffy&nbsp;i apologise for that.&nbsp; Anyway carrying on Bald has managed to kick out a little update for WOA which contained a Link to my website, and also a link to  urlLink B3ta  which is&nbsp; a website which i frequent often posting crazy pictures i make up on photoshop.&nbsp; Yes so im rather pleased he's updated so he deserves a woo a yay and a hoopla and possibly a visit to his blog!&nbsp;   Yup and in other trivial nu's i was messing around on the flash game that lets you create your own sonic person again and i shazamed up this happy little fellow.     i can imagine he will have some pretty sad story to tell about revenge for his dead wife/friend/cat whatever and a wandering soul keeper/crow/tramp took pitty on him and gave him&nbsp; super powers of Strength/Speed/Noir Graphics&nbsp; to defeat the evil Druglord/Pimp/Car owner that took his most treasured love away from him.&nbsp; YAY MAKE UR OWN ADVENTURE  Hehe well nevermind that and on with the show!  Well today has been rather boring again in my view, accept for the kick arse thunderstorm and finaly beign able to send away my column.&nbsp; Woo yay hoopla once again for that.&nbsp; But hey after that my day was mostly filled with a craving to listen to Oasis *dont ask me why* and im alright in happiness at the moment, just that usual angsty stuff putting pressure on me, i dunno, just confused a lot by it.  Ohh well hopefully i will have more on that for you soon. Cya later Ben.

      Hey all!  Just a quick morning blog just to tell you in advance why early august is gonna be super jumpy for me.&nbsp; Lol well anyway most of you lovely lovey people who read my blog know that im trying to get a job writing for the Derby Telegraph.&nbsp; Lol or as mark calls it "That evil lefty rag*&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm.  Well anyway after a lot of Amazing help from Amber, (The Queen of proofreading) i have finaly managed to send my article off to the Derby telegraph (or evil lefty rag.)&nbsp; So after a super quick get it away from me email its painful enough telling me how much i suck just do it uber quick!&nbsp; So anyway when i get a email back a few mins later, i thought "YAY THEY LET ME DOWN QUICK!"&nbsp; i got a sudden shazam as the email just said "Thankyou Ben i will enjoy reading your article and&nbsp; we will tell you are decision early august.  EARLY AUGUST!&nbsp; ARRR!&nbsp; DAM U LEFTY RAG!&nbsp; Lol well anyway thats quite annoying due to the fact that why cant they just tell you u suck then and then.&nbsp; Obviously that is beyond em but hey nevermind.&nbsp; Right well anyway i might aswell put up the article i sent to them on here so all my bloggies can have a cheap laugh.   My Column   Hello!  &nbsp;  I guess if you’re going to be reading this article frequently, I had better introduce myself. My name’s Ben and I have just finished compulsory education. My favourite pastimes are hanging out with my mates and writing so typical teenage stuff there, Ohh and did I mention Rock music and poetry, yes I’m afraid the parental figure may stereotype me a little.&nbsp; I am also hopefully going to college in September to study History, Biology, Media and Communication Studies. Well I say hopefully, because I need the right grades to get into the college I want. So I still have a long wait to find the truth.&nbsp; I’m in the middle of a ten week holiday between secondary school and college, kind of like an educational limbo, but that doesn’t bother me much! In this long wait, of which I am suspended in at this time, I have promised myself I would do something that would really change my life for the better, well at least I hoped it would but I really didn’t know how.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to write a book I mean, I’ve seen it done and heard the tales of people writing books in their lunch hours penning great stories and I really wanted to do one myself.&nbsp; Although, the bitter truth of the matter as I am finding out is, it isn’t that easy!&nbsp; I just don’t seem to be able to write something that I’d actually enjoy, and that’s what I wanted, something teenagers could enjoy that actually meant something. Not just another book in a pink cover!&nbsp; That’s what always annoys me about modern literature, it removes greats from bookshelf’s like ‘Interview With The Vampire’, ‘The Lord Of The Rings’ and ‘1984’ which are being overlooked by modern teens and I wanted to end this.&nbsp; Yes it almost seems like heresy to even think I could write a 1984 but one can dream!&nbsp; But of course the reality is always very different.  &nbsp;At the beginning of these ten weeks I thought how carefree I would be, just like when I was younger and id spend all my time playing computer games and hanging around with my friends.&nbsp; But that’s not all of it, I guess my freedom has come at a price, and that was the discovery of the ever-stereotyped teenage angst.&nbsp; The “he will grow out of it phase!”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ten weeks of my life that im going through are defiantly influential. There is absolutely no doubt I have experienced some great things, but with these experiences comes worry.&nbsp; Nothing is trivial, that I have learnt well, due to the fact that everything people do seems to be suddenly of top importance to me, girls drive you crazy with the smallest meaningless gestures, parents can say things to you that will just drive you up the wall. Even if it is just “Will you polish the chairs for me today Ben” It seems that pressure is constantly put on you to do the right thing, to be a good person and to make the right decisions.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This pressure comes from so many directions at times, usually at the times you just want to forget everything. You already have a enough trouble worrying about whether or not your going to pass your Maths exam, without having to worry about somebody hating you just because you listen to rock music or don’t abide by some unwritten rules.&nbsp; Everyone has an opinion, I believe they are entitled to it, but how they use it sometimes is just wrong, and that is what brings people down.&nbsp; I always like to think I can help people, and I constantly see people who already have enough problems being hurt by others, just because they don’t wear the right clothes, or act like the person someone else wants them to be.&nbsp; I know in these ten weeks, even if I don’t write my novel, I’m going to come out of it ready for college with an understanding that I never had before. Hopefully, by reading this you will to.

      Greetings one and all to my blog woo yay hoopla!  Lol well anyway today was very much like any other day for me at the moment, spending time writing and makeing photoshop pictures while talking to folk on MSN and then going for some kind of walk to somewere out in ockbrook.&nbsp; Well anyway todays walk so me dragging Bald, and Mark round ockbrook graveyard takeing pictures of the old graves.&nbsp; Yup what a wholesome activity this was, however we all had a reasonable time doing that and jimmying round the country side.&nbsp; Woo.&nbsp;   In other news my mum keeps telling me i look depressed again, err woo she's probably right i mean i listen to, to much MUSE, i have a inability to get anything i truly want and im just dam well pissed off with stuff a lot of the time.&nbsp; I dunno really just wish stuff was easier than it is... but guess what *shocking revalation* its not.&nbsp; Well at least not to me anyway, i believe that everyone has one state of mind that they find very easy to slip into and one they find incredibly diffrent.&nbsp; I guess mine is that of being totaly neutral, i always on some level have to be into something if it interests me, the neutral stance is just something i have not got the hang of at all.&nbsp;   Or in true confusing physcological style it could be that im UBER neutral... I just dont know, i dont really know anything will everyone please just explain!  thanks for listening Ben

      Hi all. &nbsp; Well once again im here on another far from interesting sunday nigth blogging up my far from interesting day.&nbsp; I hope you all had a much better day than me and managed to have this thing that i do believe is called fun. &nbsp; Ohh well anyway, today saw me doing not a lot at all really, just the usual sunday affair of going tos e my Granny and Grandad.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that cues been laughed at for a variety of activitys which i take part in then going up the alotment and getting rained upon.&nbsp; Sigh i hate the weather, it always stops me doing anything i want to do, and its always used to stop others having fun with me and such like... well i suppose i ought to just say this quote "Cant rain all the time" but im starting to feel that, that is wrong. &nbsp; *Sigh* im just sick and tired of being constantly blown back in everything i do, its like running constantly against a brick wall that you know is not gonna give in but your gonna try to smash it down anyway.&nbsp; I dunno what makes me keep running at it, i might have just convinced a part of my brain that the wall has eventually got to give, but i think im lieing to myself. &nbsp; "Steal The Life Thats Inside Of Me"&nbsp; Yup that about sums up how im feeling, i have to keep trying but i really need to stop because i think its starting to take its toll on both my body and my mind.&nbsp; Yup going insane thats probably it. &nbsp; I dont know what to say apart from that, just feel like im in a void again and i have to get out one way or another. &nbsp; *Takes another run up at the wall* cya later Ben. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Hello everybody &nbsp; Phew decided on a early blog today just to start this freezing cold day off with a varitable bang of blogging.&nbsp; Well as if you didnt already notice today is Saturday and as always my Saturday would not have been compleate without wakeing up not being able to walk.&nbsp; *Sigh* why does Peter always sit on my legs on Saturday!&nbsp; So unfair, and kinda painful to. &nbsp; Grr plus it so didnt help that i actually got a proper 8 hours sleep last night at a somewere near human time, i swear these normal hours are not good for you, but i was knackered last night after my big walk to hermits cave and then somehow later that night ended up at Redhill summer fair in ockbrook.&nbsp; Ohh well at least that was cool because we did get free icecreams off Bald yay!&nbsp; Shame about the fair mind... worse than the one they always hold at Borrowood (my old junior school) and that is most deffo saying something. &nbsp; Well anyway enough pleasantrys on with the show! &nbsp; I dunno really ive just been feeling down lately, i cant seem to enjoy anything anymore, feel sick all the time to which sucks.&nbsp; Ive almost compleatly given up on trying to be human, i mean if some people think im some kinda lesser being alien monster thing, hell why not, not as if it really matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; They know there right... (yes i fitted in something to do with the title!)&nbsp; &nbsp; *Sigh* well anyway at least i can never say i didnt try, i tried hard, i tried really hard... but it doesnt seem to work, ohh great... i dont want to give up but i think my body will give up for me, stupid headaces and projectile (.....)&nbsp;  &nbsp; But one bit of good news over the past few days is that i finished my article that im gonna send off that will hopefully get me the colum job that i wanted woot!&nbsp; Just need folk to neb and prod at it and tell me to send it then it shall be done by Monday hopefully hurrah!&nbsp; The only major problem is though i  Know  i will not get the job but hey ive been shouted at by people to much about that attitude im just gonna say "Go letter go!" &nbsp; Grr also just if my own social problems havent pushed and pissed me off enough already since i got up about an hour and a half ago ive been bothered by 3 callers trying to sell me cheap crap like tiles and internet from wanadoo ARRRR!&nbsp; So basicly to annoy them i have so far Laughed manicly down the phone at Tile woman till she hung up.&nbsp; Then i kindly told Wannadoo guy he can shove his incredibly slow internet down his throat.&nbsp; Then losing my creative edge at that the window woman just got told to fuck off. &nbsp; Arr Poems!&nbsp; *Runs from the inevatible poem writing* WACK! Stereotyped! &nbsp; *Sigh* cya later all thx for reading. Ben. &nbsp;

       Greetings one and all!     &nbsp;   Ok you will have to forgive me if the font is diffrent to usual but blogger has suffered from a massive update in its writing style so any old noob can now make a blog look cool... dam.&nbsp; Ohh well sounds a bit bitter but nevermind, i hope you all had as good a day as i did, as Me, Bald, Jenks and Joe set out once again for Hermits Cave!     &nbsp;   Woo i apologise in advance that this blog is gonna be a bit image heavy, so the journey began at once and we all set off with a song in our hearts and lunch in our bags!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;      Bald and Jenks made sure to keep us well entertained with good loud shoutings of random words such as BEE and the fact they had line marker and matches in there bags!&nbsp; That deffo made for some fun later.     &nbsp;   On we traveled forth like the great adventures we think ourselfs to be but even we were not prepared for what the witch had in store for us, as about half way through our journey we encountered a odd house that had a sheeps bone on its gate post and a very foreboding sign on its gate      &nbsp;  Woo that wasnt very pleasnt of them, and by this point we were all slightly fatigued with our efforts, *plus we thought the witch was trying to curse us, so with our spirits for reasons unknown near to breakage we all had to stop for a massive rest.&nbsp; The only thing that would get us going again after thatw as yelling YAWP! At the top of our lungs for no reason at all.&nbsp; (I dare you to try it, you feel much better afterwards.)  &nbsp;  So on we adventured through errie woods(Top right blair witch symbol eek!).    and we finaly reached the cave, where the Jack Osbourne voice in me that was dying to get out asked     "Do you have a flask?"  &nbsp;  So after it turned out none of us had a flask Adam decided he really was  dieing  for a cup of tea  &nbsp;   But we managed to coax him down and celebrated by eating marshmellows however we were assailed by a dragon!     &nbsp;  But it turned out to be Jenks and some line Marker.&nbsp; So after nearly roasting Balds nose and running up the hill without using the staircase we decided it was time to head home to Bartlewood lodge for chippys and coke!&nbsp; Woot!  But after getting there and eating our chips we all just ended up in a vinegar drinking competition, what a way to end the day.  &nbsp;  The most suprising thing was none of us died.  Lol cya later!  Ben.

      Hello Everybody!  Yes it is i Ben once again hitting blogger so hard with my crap it makes its very digital head spin!  Woo well anyway i hope you all had a good day today on this ~Fine~ summers day.  Summer rain Summer rain!  Lol well anyway im not cracking any musical number open today!    Ohh well on with this show.  I didnt do a lot today really jsut went to go see Spiderman 2, i just suddenly thought to myself, why dont i instead of saying "i want to go see it" why dont i just go see it!  Lol and i did and i enjoyed it quite a lot actually.  Its a bit darker than the first one less pussified and more violent, woo yay violence.  Particulary think Doc. oc is kick arse, especialy if you think about it his super villain powers are really revolve around something so lame as 4 big metal arms.  Lol well anyway i got extra nerd points im sure during the movie by spotting that Stan Lee *The creator of Marvel comics* once again made another cameo in it, lol i really have to get out more.  Well so thats another super hero movie ive seen and will no doubt not be the last concidering the vast amount of superhero movies that are coming out at the moment, such as Hellboy, The Cat Woman, The Punisher and X-men 3.  *Sigh* im sure everyone will get really bored of them eventually and its a shame because some of these characters there boosting to movie status have really cool comic book plots and storys but the big screen will really kill them.  Also a lot of films that were orignaly Manga comic books have been capture and are in the process of being ingested by holywood, such as the new I,Robot starring Will Smith and the holywood remake of 'The Ghost In The Shell.'  But thats all well and good and they may even be quite cool but with Holywood makeing all this money they are in danger of losing the cult following and the interesting individual storys of these heros just to make them more mainstream and believable.  Its just a shame in years to come kids are gonan remember the big heros such as Spider-Man and the X-men, just because the films had wicked CGI and mainstream plots, but less and less people are gonna remember truly great writing and storys.  Which some people may not appreciate because they see all the pretty pictures in the comics and Manga, but those things do take a lot of writing aswell as drawing.  So ive assembled a bit of a  True  list of great films, that were originaly of comic book creation but people have forgotten because they aint all exlosions and CGI  .The Crow (Based on a Graphic novel by James O'bar) .The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Comic Book by Allen Moore) .Spawn (Comic Book Written by Brian Holguin)  I strongly suggest u check these 3 films out if you havent already.  Hehe well thats my little witter for the under represented writers. Thx for listening Ben.

      Hello everyone.  Woo well today im really quite tired so i havent had much time to concentrate on the angtsy side of life.  (If someone even trys to whistle python style we will have to get a record contract!)  Lol well anyway, i hope your day was ever loving amazingness, as my day was how can i put it, very long, very boring and at times painful.  Yes thats right everyone Ben visited the orthadontist today *JOY!*  Woo well i hate going there especialy as my orthdontist, in the nicest way possible is a pathetic, tard with the skill of orthdontic work on comparison to a Llama on LSD.    So it starts off plain enough, me having to tell Captain tard that i need to have my brace off by September due to after that im not gonna be able to make any appointments on his stupid time ever again, (plus ive had this fucking thing on the best part of five years, ive forgotten what its like to not have metal in my mouth!)  But of course captain tard decides it cant be taken from me till December!  Then he proceeds his usual tightning of the brace technique, which involves him inserting tighter wires, as quick as he can into my face ramming the razor sharp end pieces as far as he can into my gum before he remembers he forgot to cut the fuckers down!    HE HAS DONE THIS EVERY TIME SINCE I STARTED SEEING HIM!  ARRRRR!  I swear next time just give me the Llama on LSD.  But anyway time for a short interlude!     Woo back, lol well now that i am home and my brace is once again starting to push so hard into my teeth that it has blanked all emotions except for slow dull aching physical pain i may have to crack open the Laudanum on my late night writing spree's YAY i get to be like Samuel Talyor Coleridge (He wrote Rhyme of the ancient mariner and all the other famously drunk or stoned english writers and poets!  Well i would if Laudanum wasnt compleate 110% illegal now!    Yup well anyway in my continuation of rewatching every episode of Buffy ever made on sky one today saw the second part of the episode with the Judge in yay!  I love the series 2 through to 4 the most because Oz and Willow are together yay for them!  Lol yes if u didnt already know ive always loved watching Buffy ever since my sister (yup she's responsible for a lot) introduced me to it.  So anyway im kinda happy in a physical sense due to i just saw one of the greatest episodes of Buffy ever woot, and one of the best quotes to!  Willow: Remember Buffy Carpe Dium, u taught me that once. Buffy:  What Fish Of The Day!  Im sorry that just breaks me. Lol well i guess you could say im a bit hyper tonight, well i am because if i wasnt id probably reject everyone and sit hunched up a corner rocking and mumbling.  Lol well anyway thats my lot, bubye and thx for reading Love Ben.

      Hello everyone.  Woo well err *cough* i think after my crazy blogging skills last nigth i owe you all a apology for having to read it.  All of it was true that i said last night though probably blasted out of context due to the sheer weight of shit that had been builiding up for a while.  Ohh well i do feel much better now and i might even publish up some of my poems to celebrate... but thinking about it i dont want to annoy you still more!  Hehe so err yeah today... hmm whats to say about today, i have so far done fuck all apart from had a few games of Tournie with Mr Bald, lol probably if he ever gets back on MSN might shout at him to come round and bring my albums with me.  Lol so in a way its quite shocking that i wrote yesterdays post without even being under the infulence of MUSE... weird.  Still feeling a bit sick today and if i think about it still feel a bit down, but hey the less i think about it the better it gets, woo childish approach is also the best.  Err yeah well i think my PC is feeling a bit poorly at the moment just seems to be telling me things excist that actually dont which is quite annoying.  But hey as long as i can blog, chat and listen to heavy metal music i should be ok.  Woo havent done one of these for a while, LIST TIME!   Stuff thats Kept me, Awake, Alive, Reasonbly happy, and un comatosed due to lack of sleep over the past few days!  .Seeing Shrek 2 yesterday  (I am Puss... In boots!) .Being shouted at by my mates after de railing myself yesterday (quite funny in heinsight) .Juice .UCI Nachos .Finaly Being Able to sleep .My mp3 collection! .U guys! (woot for you)  So err yeah im probably back to normal now, err i dunno actually, might have to bang my head just that little bit harder next time.  Hehe cya Later Ben

      Hello.  Got a Angsty late night blog for you, i dont think ive felt this low really in quite a long while, sure when im away somewere im away from the pain, running away and ignoring it, only concentrating on the path in front of me.  But when i come back to seek the remedy of something i truly want, all i get is echos of my own voice.  Ive been ignored before this i know but not like this, this cuts deeper than that, a hollow room with no reply to my call but the sound of my own voice, my love, and my emotion rejected and left to die on the cold harsh cobbles of my own bitter mind.  I just feel sick all the time now, weakend, my mind cant even think straight anymore its just bent and broken by something that i have absoultly no control over.  It just annoys me so much this constant desperate attempt i make to get through to people and the bitter crunch as i once again hit that wall, and that wall moves ever closer to me as i run out of options and everything seems to be dragged further away from me.  I really wish i hadnt started trying because i am determined to win out even some minor victory even though i quite frankly know that this is not possible for me because of who i am what my ideas are and how my brain works.  Any attempt to make others feel good about themselfs does not work, they act as though my words mean nothing and they could spend the night talking about themselfs but to me all is recived is nothingness.  I try so hard yet fail unrewarded and pointlessly lost once again.  I had a falling out with my dad the other day, it was over some trivial and unimportant matter, but one of his words did hit me were it hurts and it still reflects today everytime i try to make contact with these people and talk to them like the friends i judge them to be.  "You have no opinion and nobody cares what you think."  Now i know he said this in anger and he doesnt believe it... but i feel a lot of people do.  Im made to feel inhuman by some people, i mean waht is so despretly wrong with me that i am forced to feel this way? Am i not a person same as them!  What gives them the right to judge me, i never judged them, my only crime is loving them and treating them with the respect they deserve.  My words fall on dead ground to some people, my emotions wither and perish for i feel now more than ever they are useless.  Tonight i feel unhuman.  Thankyou for listening Ben

      Greetings Mortals.  Well now it is time for the proper blog of the night, on this very fine day of July 12th of the year 2004.  Lol i already think that ive lived this day twice with me staying up so late on MSN chatting away to Amber and Bald... im sooo tired now so im paying for it.  *Sigh* unlike Bald who doesnt need to sleep.  i said "I cant function without sleep how do you do it?"  and he just said back "I dont function anyway"  or we both said words to that affect which led up to his quote.  Woot im tired and i dont even feel that great.  Woo well anyway Me, Adam and Bald went to go Shrek 2 today, and i personaly thought it was better than the first one, lol i just loved Puss in Boots, and John Cleese as the king now that was hilarious.  I dunno it just seemed more grown up than the first one and more about the other characters and not just his smelly ogreness.  Lol seriously if u havent seen this movie yet i implore you to see it, its really kick arse.    Yeah well apart from that i havent done a awful lot today apart from downloading a shit load more Mp3's because i had nothing else to do.  Yup i know i should be writing but my brain today feels like it has suffered a head on collision with a train full of night nurse.  Now thats a image i would actually like to see, i might even paint mash it later for my own enjoyment!  Well that is if i havent slipped into a coma or some kind of a panic attack which i often suffer from.  Ohh well hopefully cya on MSN! Ben.

      Hello the silent friends of my blog.  Yup today was sunday, and you know what that means, boredom, cold tempretures *its always cold on a sunday i swear* and the serious lack of interesting stuff that happens.  Lol i think the only thing ive got to look forward tonight is Kingdom Hospital yay.  But anyway enough about that, i hope you had a good day today and actually found out that sunday contains a useful or interesting activity.  Woo typical boredom and angst fro me today, when the days are boring i think me, and when i think more my state of mind gets more and more worrying.  Had my Dad bothering me all day wondering why i was sat about the house doing very little.  "Why arent you doing anything today Ben?"  "Err because nobody wants to do anything and i dont fancy doing anything myself."  *Sigh* but of course this answer not being good enough i was bothered several more times through the day.  Grrrr8.  Also my Dad asked me about Stairway to Heaven, he had heard the track for the first time in ages the other day and he was wondering if i had it... *sigh* do i have it, lol yeah i have 3 copys as a mater of fact. *funny look from my Dad*    Lol woah have u only jsut realized your sons rather odd.  Grr i dont know what it is my parents have suddenly realized that i look depressed and stuff, and my Mum keeps saying "Cheer up Ben!"    Me: "Make me"  grr they just dont get it do they.  Well in other nu's  tommorow ima going to the 3:30 showing of Shrek 2 at the UCI so if anyone wants to come see that plz get there before 3:30.  Ive been reliably informed that it is a good movie and i wont be dissapointed... woah even me as total movie critic guy wont be dissapointed... shocking.    Lol well anyway speaking of Movies, yesterday i saw one of the best movies ever made, woot yup and that was Dead Poets Society, starring Robin Williams.  Lol now lets face it we all know Robin Williams is a jerk, but very much like Good morning Vietnam, which i also enjoyed he is not his usual jerky twaty self and he actually is prepared to let other people act in this movie.  I wont go into any plot detail or anything other than if you can, watch this movie.  I swear you will take something rewarding from it.  So err Carpe Dium* are the words i give to you, it is rather uplifiting movie in some sense but in others deffo not.  In otherwords its class.  Im quite plzed this week in a movie sense because i havent watch any crap movies, just watched Interview with the Vampire, Spiderman, The nightmare on Elm Street and finaly Dead Poets last night.  Good stuff, one and all.  Yeah well anyway i will be glad to be going out tommorow so i dont get anymore questions of "Why are you looking so down Ben and all that crap, i mean im not gonan tell them if i havent even told you guys!  Hehe well anyway its my problem i will deal, so anyway Carpe Dium*!  to you all again and err thx for reading!  Ben  *Carpe Dium=Seize The Day

      Hiya  Yup another Pt.2 blog today, but hey thinking of titles is sometimes really annoying plus id like to think that this title was still relevant today.  Well anyway today was spent very much like yesterday of doing not a awful lot apart from wandering around and talking to folk.  I really im starting to think that what little snaity ive got left in me is ebbing away.    I mean i think to much, thats one major thing.  I seem to spend the majority of my time just thinking, about friends, life, writing.  All that stuff that seems trivial but of course its not because nothing is.  Its just the idea that i really want to find something in my life that is brand new, revalutionary and enlighting.  I guess i search for it in the trivial, for no bigger jesture is than one so small it seems to be a universe entirly entrapt within itself.  Also with me Vagabonding around you get to find the vastly diffrent oppinions of diffrent people and for instance a diffrent take on something you have both witnessed together.  Its interesting doing that because you can get a real and in the end diffinitive view of a event which you could not fully and entirley grasp on your own.  Because without people to disscus and share opinions, views and experinces with you would never get past your own oppinion to respect others.  Lol yeah all this Vagabond wandering is putting things in perspective for me, but i cant help wonder if its the kind of perspective i truly want, you know i cant help but think sometimes im running away from the emotion and the pain of reality.  It just gets a bit to much and you just wanna escape, but you know its still gonna be there, my minds still gonna bother me and tell me that im a coward and im running away from everything just for the sake of a few hours peace.  But i dunno, just seems that the time needs wasteing all it would only make me feel worse.  Sorry todays blogs short, cant seem to get out my words tonight. Ben.

      Heya everyone  Woo this week seems to have gone uber quick for me i dont know why, and once again i reach friday and ive just come back from karate and im looking back at this week.  Well its deffo nearing the pressure time, and in some aspects i guess its already starting to become a bit clutered and opressive in this place they call my mind.   You know its my story for one thing... i now have about eight weeks to get this story finished, but it aint working that way... im stuck, horrific writers block as always.  I also have 20 days to get these two articles off to have a attempt at getting a writing Job, i aint even started them, its just the fact that i think ive got time to do everything but i havent these 8 weeks and in the case of my Job about 20 days are begining to slip from my grasp, and its begining to grate with me.  it just seems that even though these are supposed to be the best 10 weeks of our lives, i have so far had very few Uber good times, and ive been mostly up to my eyebrows everyday with my story, my blog, my poems, my pictures my shit... flaggy, flaggy by one!  I-E-A-I-A-I-O WHY!   Why the fuck indeed i say.  It seems that everywere i look at the moment i see burnt out people.  People knackered by these crazy shit routines they are put through by people and they have to jump through hoops for others just to get nowere really apart from having there shit devour them late at night.  Yup and it really sucks dont it.  Fucking hoopla im sick to death of Jumping, but i gotta do it.    You know and in this vain attempt to get back something thats truly mine i have to stay up till god knows what fucking time in the morning just to remember im alive and i actually still have a life thats mine and not one that someone else uses constantly to get off on there own sense of constrewd satisfaction. This of course leads to me waking up late in the morning, which even though in some sense of the word is cool but its also not because you realize youve wasted half the day, youve got a million chores to do and all the while meantime in the back of your head the promises you made to yourself are nagging away, but you cant please everyone can you... and of course choosing to help others is the route i take and the route that kicks you so hard you dont know which way to turn next (yeah i might tell you soon)  It just seems like im trapped in some kinda wurling maelstrom of annoyance and juty to others, just to pay for all the major league fun we are gonna have in between the mental pain of college.  Damn it to hell John Lennon has never been so right "Soon as your born they make you feel small by giving you no time instead of it all... till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all."  Thats from a track called 'Working Class Hero' by John Lennon, if you aint got it download now!  Its some what a anthem of this particular post :P  Hehe read it again while playing it!  Yeah well im done for now, the personal Angst will come at a later date... when its really ready to be shouted.  :P  Thanks for reading Ben.

      Hello everyone!  Well a random happy blog today going out to everyone.  Its weird because i know if i wanted i could angst about a lot of things tonight, but i just dont wanna think about them at the moment.  I guess my works been keeping me busy, been doing a bit of writing and also mainly trying to boost up over the wall of freewebs shit hosting a website to play in the garden of internet, and so far here it is!   urlLink The Crypt Of Benjamin The Immortal   Yes so if im a very good boy the master of Internet Puppets himself, Bald will attach it to World Of Angst!  so yay hoopla to that!  So some of you people who are very bored at this moment... lol i know thats the only reason you read this, "What did Ben get up to today on this less than great day!" Well i will tell you, mostly hacked this website into the net all morning but in the afternoon me and Mr Adam Chapman went for a bit of a adventure round some of the more secret bits and bobs of Spondon.  Woot very cool stuff, wish id bought my camera as we discovered the water resovoir for spondon, and its a very old creepy delabated bomb shelter style place with a amazingly scary resident evil style rusty brown gate with razor wire crudley tied all over it.  It might as well have a sign on it saying "DANGER T VIRUS BIOHAZARD!"  Lol sorry all you non computer game fans or people who have no idea about gameing history but anyway twas super cool!  Lol we also discovered our secret village not so secret after all *major embaresment when we came up next to the cricket ground*  lol we suck.  Lol and back to the title of the blog, yup ive discovered over these 9 weeks we have left ima gonna becoem a traveling Vagabond as such, plus this discovery backed up the way everyone seemd to be working but me!  Lol well anyway to be free!  *chinks imaginery shot of JD with ur equaly imaginary one*  Woo well thats about it really, cya on the other side. Ben.

      Hello again.  *Sigh* well after my beyond shit early morning gamble in which i lost in dramatic style i had to get my hair cut because of this fact.  *Sigh* so here it is prepare to laugh    Yes i know my camera is gloriously shit but you can also see that the hair and to think the face behind it doesnt help matters much either *shudders*  So anyway to cheer myself up i bought a special addition copy of MUSE's Origin of Symmetry and i have been listening to that most of the afternoon yay!  I love the origin of symmetry it has super duper kick arse tracks on it including Bliss and Plug in baby, which both truly do own on earth as it is in heaven.  So well feeling dejected after my earliy morning gamble and listening to to much MUSE me and Bald AKA  urlLink Phantom  decided we would go all dejected and go for a man of the road style walk about.  Woo so a  urlLink WOA  event it was indeed so we hammered around spondon at first, laughing at Ben Gillams Nu job.  Ha ha he so cant hack it.  So feeling better that we'd made fun of another human being we wandered off to ockbrock talking about the usual stuff, including Balds increasing pyroness which is very cool to watch so im sure if u ask him nicely he will send u some truly hilarious video tape.  So after wandering around ockbrook and offending a old person by making a lighter that Bald found in the street explode with a very satisfying pop it was time to go home and listen to more MUSE.  Why the fuck did this mornign have to cock up so badly, all though mine and Balds ockbrook adventure was fun.  Woo so continue to visit us over at  urlLink WOA  plz for more such kick arse film and adventures.   Ohh well so apart from that cool adventure, my day sucked and its all my stupid minds fault.  Woo Rice Crispy Syndrome is kicking in very much tonight to the extent of a Bald Quote  "I like to think im useless in every way."  Cya!  P.s.  Yay Hoopla I noticed i hit my 100th link in this blog.

      Hello all.  Woo a morning blog, that must mean i had a idea what i was gonna do today,  and i made a bet with my mum last night i said "If i dont get to do what i wanted to do today, i will get my hair cut."  Well my plan just got cannonballed and sank to the bottom of the ocean before a shot was even fired.  So ima gonna get my hair cut.   Bubye Hair.  *sigh* well i guess my decision that i came to left me no other choice... dammit.  Lol my only last wish is the most far out one ever that the moment its cut it starts growing back, like in the vampire chronicals lol.  Id just love to scare the fuck out of the hairdresser that way.  *sigh* i shouldnt have stayed up and watched interview last night.  So under a massive dose of Rice Crispie syndrome (A syndrome i invented in which you feel like a makey box  of rice crispies left on the shelf of a shop that nobody wants to buy and its only goal in lfe is to occupy space)  my hair goes to meet its maker.  Cya later.

      Heya all  Lol well another late blog tonight, which is kinda annoyign but i aint really bothered i guess it means ive got more to talk about now.  Well anyway  i hope today see's you well and youve all been enjoying the sunshine adn the company you keep!  Now the formalitys are out of the way once again, on with the blog.  Today saw me doing the usual activity of just hanging around not doing very much at all.  However we did try to fit ina  interesting town touring spondons parks on somewhat of a frisbee tour.  Lol we also attached Balds sound bug to as many things as possible to make even the most burberry of Chavs listen to such great hits as 'Sweet Child Of Mine' and 'Innervisio'  So through its magical gift of being able to turn any flat surface into a music speaker it is now the coolest device on the planet.  Ohh yeah and my writingness, has once again hit a all time low due to the fact that i cant get over this very very dramatic writers block i seem to have going on.  :( dammit.  Also due to the fact that ive been so distracted with everything i do believe im letting it all cave in on my head... which sucks... a lot.  Yeah well and i also discovered i have got absoultly nothing to do tommorow *sigh* so please someone save me from that.  But anyway even if i seem distant and annoyed at the moment its nothing to do with you, im just driving myself insane, so plz just tell me how you feel if your pissed with me or ought.  Well with that said id like to once again thank you all for listening... i love you all and goodnight.

      Greetings.  Heya all this is my proper blog for tonight and by hell im gonna hopefully give it some of the Angst filled goodness it deserves.  Lately ive been feeling really depressed most of the time, its really starting to get to me the way some people are how they treat you how they refuse to be normal around you and no matter how hard you try you cannot break through to these people.  This is a form of Angst, i feel outcasted sometimes, no replace that with all the time... by certain people.  They make you doubt your own mind with the sheer diffrence of theirs and the way they hide the way they feel and think makes you wonder if its normal to think the way that you do yourself.  I dunno i just feel like im being got to lately, and the funny thing is the people who are doing it to me dont even know they are doing it.  They think that your gonna be alright and tell you how everything  is good and great the sun is shining i did such and such today why dont you get a real job cut your hair, everythings great in my world i would ask how it was in  yours but i dont care to listen!  Some people dont want to listen, thats the sad fact of life, everyone wants to speak but some people do not give a toss about listening.  Ohh no its alright im only there for you all the time but hey it doesnt really matter that you dont listen to me because im still gonna be there.  Woo how fucked up is that.  Angst comes in another form at this moment.  Failure... i resign myself to the simple fact that i probably am one.  I mean im suffering from terrible writers block, i am inept in getting anything to work, to get anyone to listen to me, im just in the background of life screaming, like the noise of a train as someone else walks past it... the train always makes the noise, but you dont have to listen to it because there are more important things going on.    I dunno really i just feel like everything i do at this time in my life is getting me nowere, im just hurled from one day to the next to suffer at the hands of the same people, here the same things, do the same things and witness the same things.  I cant break free of what is not freely given to me.  Its almost like ive been given a puzzel but sevral people have stolen the pieces and hidden them away far beyond my reach, and they all give instructions to find them but non in a language i understand.  People would benifit a lot more from each other if we madem ourselfs a lot more clearer... but the problem is everyones to shy to so someone has to start.  In lies the problem.

      Greetings!  Woo today has been a very odd day of trawling round the internet and makeing photoshop pictures of rockstars as animals!  So in otherwords has been a weird day... but very cool due to the fact i discovered something truly awsome!  I discovered 6 flash Animations YES THATS SIX!, directed and written by the master himself Tim Burton woot!  About the adventures of Stainboy!  Double woot!  So without further ado you may all now revel in the creepy humour of the master himself now in flash form!     urlLink i still cant believe there is six!   You are the master Tim, no doubt.  Lol well in other new's here are the piccys i made today, the first is of Alexander Kapranos (the lead in franz Ferdinand) as a dog, singing "take me out" which can be found  urlLink Here   Plus the second is James Hetfield (Of Metallica Fame) Takeing "Of Wolf And Man" a little to seriously and this can be found  urlLink Here   Lol so thats what ive been up to this afternoon, as well as this very lame joke   urlLink Granny Knot   Lol well enjoy my heavy linkage, and there will be a proper blog later!

      Greetings one and all!  Well today as most days appear to be at the moment, was boring in my view, i did the usual lark of writing more story, yay, reading some more Edgar Allen Poe, yay and chatted to some folk on MSN.  However i did discover one of the coolest features of MSN today, Audio conversation!  Woot this is really cool for me especially at the moment, as im getting a lot of pain in the ends of my fingers, at the moment its rather strange really.  Ohh well audio conversation owns because you can witter and witter, and not only do you here people for real which is nice, u get a sense of their real emotions which normal MSN severely lacks.  Lol well anyway i thought that was really cool.  In fact the only cool thing that happened all day... apart from the rain coming down like stair rods, now that was really cool.  Also managed to type up my poem i wrote about 4 days ago now, but that doesnt really matter, just glad i got it to switch context without being ruined.  Lol well anyway bit of angst as always today but it was just the usual stuff, that nobody can really console you of... you know you just have to deal with it.  Lol still haven’t done enough writing i fear, my protagonist the great and Mighty Jez, seems gloriously still far from writing his own misadventures, and my short story about body snatching in the 19th century is still non existent.  *sigh* Ohh well maybe i will get some proper work done tomorrow.  Lol but if anyone wants to have fun *looks around hopefully*  plz let me know. Hehe well anyway cya tommorow.  Ben.

      Greetings The Folk Who Live In My Blog!  Well today was rather shall i dare say it... boring.  Yup 110% nothing better to do than listen to MUSE and watch Takishi's castle and flick on kerrnag to go "Ohh cool Anime style Music vid, shame about the wank song)  Aww yes those shit heads linkin park stealing cool ideas thast good bands could have used!    Lol well anyway i do believe that video is the coolest thing about lincon park... in fact the only cool thing about lincon park... no actually there is another, or am i alone in thinking the Hybrid Nazi soldier was uber cool but a bit out of place on a album produced by Warner bro's.  Hmm ohh yeah, and the awsome flash parody of Charlie Brown and the peanuts crew doing in the end, which is buried in the middle of this awsome flash cartoon which can be located  urlLink here   Woot so anyway enough of my love for the INA cartoons, in all they glory of blood, guts and hillarious rip takes of all the bands i hate "I didnt vote for Suk 41 because they really suck!"    ON WITH THE FREAK SHOW!  Yeah well anyway i dont think im getting enough sleep lately, it wouldnt normaly worry me accept for im starting to have really fucked up dreams again, i mean take todays adventure through the windshield  basicly i was in a cave looking out on a tunnel pooring water into big conch shells when i saw the grim reaper, and he came up to me, and *Shazam* time to wake up BEN!  It was actually quite scary which is weird for me because normaly i dont get nightmares that scare me, just u know bother me.  Lol well anyway its my own fault im getting them, basicly i stay up till 3:00am most days writeing and reading the works of Edgar Allen Poe.  *shudders* i so need to get one of those things they call "A ordinary human beings mind"  However i did right what i think is one of my dudeiest pieces of poetry the other night... which i may share with you one day... if i can be ever bothered to ram it into my Pc using my ol faithful keyboard.  Lol anyway so i really think im pushing myself to hard at the moment but i really dont know why... its almost like im looking for a answer to something in art, when i for hell as one know art only brings more questions.  *Sigh*  I really wanna write a short story aswell now, ive always wanted to do one on bodysnatchers, but ive never got up to it.  Plus with my 10 week story still very much on the smaller side, i really have to stop this whole mental pitchforking.  So err yeah gonna put this to the test now... if you wanna see my Poem i wrote the other night, err plz email me or tell me or something, otherwise i jsut wont bother putting it on the site.  Lol well anyways if you see me reading or shouting about writing mentaly *or physicly if you are near me by any chance* force me to sit down and ram a cookie in my face and Just freaking relax ok!  Ohh OHH!  Now my fave webcomic in the whole world is back on line (in fact the only webcomic i like in the whole world) i can finaly show u the closest parady i got to what my match makeing skills were like at Bill!  Woot Im the Guy with blonde hair for this Story and Ben is the guy with Purple!    urlLink WOO Stubble!   Lol thats closest i can get to my feelings in that final frame... witty shit.  So anyway if u see me torturing myself, either laugh, or knock me out! Bubye  Luv Ben

      Greetings Mortals!  Heya all i hope youve all had a good day today and not had a list of chores as long as your arm!  Woo i know i have... the list of chores that is *sigh* hoovering, ironing, and tidying my room... ohh well i guess its gotta be done, i know have nicley hoovered rugs, non creased cloths, and brand spankingly tidy room.  Woot.  Err i guess.  Yeah well in other new's i pushed ahead with my story tonight which im quite proud of yay! Lol i dont know what its actually like but i will give you a snippet in a bit if you like. Yeah well anyway next week should be a fun week for those who read my blog im hopeing to get you all to have a time with me, using my rather rubbishy organizing skills to have a laugh and do some cool stuff!  So err woot to that and i will talk to you all about it next week.  Yeah well tonights the night of the prom and i hope everyone who is going enjoys themselfs, and they all have a good laugh in their expensive clober!  As for those non prom goers!  "YAY!"  have yourself a drink of juice and some cookies and enjoy yourself safely in the knowledge you will pass your exams and you will have a great 9 weeks!  Cheers!  Lol well im hopefully sure i will pass my exams, and i really hope i do because Bill is such a great place plus i get to do Tai-Chi which is quite frankly kick arse!  Lol plus if i get as many permant memorys as often as i did at the induction ima gonna have a ball!  I mean who can forget from the folk who were there the whole back of the bus singing along to SOAD, or us all hanging in the cafe for hours on end!   Lol plus the personal memorys such as having my caricture done in Comm Studies *RAWK* lol and me and Ben in Biology "Urea doesnt go there surely!"  Woot, good times, and we are all gonna have many more, all of us, even the folk who aint gonna go to Bill we will still have some kick arse times.  Lol its like my Mum said (very insightful of her i thought)    "If you dont have a good time when your alive, when you gonna have it?"  :P very nice.  Lol well for all u lit junkies, here it is my piece of crap taster, i mean story taster!                                ~It Has No Title Yet!~  But that waiting was the killer, listening to Ratfinks heavy breathing and his greasy eyes watching over his thick glasses, Jez swore he almost shuddered and quickly looked outside.  But what he saw nearly made him fall off his chair. 	Absolute blackness.  Jez gasped and quickly turned back to Ratfink his eyes must have seemed to bulge out of his head “Ratfink look outside!”  He said in a horrified half whisper as Ratfink disturbed his greasy train of thought to look.   	“But Jezzzzzz.”   Ratfinks voice always trailed in his mind “Its just normal Jezzzzzz!”  He started to titter his little creepy laugh like a large furball would gnaw at cheese.  (Lol sorry i suck at choosing segmants Jez is the protaganist and Ratfink... is a twat!)  Lol well anyway cya later! Ben xxx

      Heya All.  I hope youve all had a cool day today, and hopefully enjoyed a lot more of it than me, (didnt wake up till about 1:15)  Sigh i hate wakeing up late and hate going to bed early so either way its annoying.  Lol well i blame my diary for keeping me up till 2:17 last night, i guess i just had a lot to write.  I just kinda talked about all of the stuff that was angst tasticing me at the moment, and it was one fucking big list... just so annoying that i feel this way, i mean it probably just sounds so fucking annoying.    ~30 years later~  "Hey so what you remember about Ben Jeffrey?" "I remember how he used to winge about every little thing!"  ~2004 right now~ *sigh*  Lol well anyway this list kinda depressed the hell out of me so i woke up with a far from positive attitude today err yay and ive mostly been listening to depressing music *MUSE and Snowpatrol if you must know*  *Sigh* i dunno i just really wonder if there is a point to any of this sometimes, i mean what is the point in thinking in terms of emotion, i just feel that being emotionless has gotta be useful because so often you realize that people you care about dont give a fuck about you, you might aswell stop having to feel pain.  You know just to forget your own mind excists the way other people always seem to.  I mean people hurt others all the time but they dont realize that they are doing it, but when it comes down to them getting hurt they are all "woah, why the fuck did that happen to me!"  Its karma and it rapes us all of everything if you let it.  Im starting to wonder if karma really does work both ways, im more starting to think that karma is just the vindictive mind of the universe, a force which only use is to cause pain, and peoples good deeds fuel its ability to cause misery.  Because surely thats what the whole world is run off, everything lives off the back of something else and emotions like anger and sorrow are the only things that remind us that we are alive.  For instance you dont when you are happy realize "ohh isnt it great and time will last for 80 so years and then we will die."  No you live forever when you happy.  When your upset or angry is the time when you realize just how mortal you are.  But i dont want others to feel misrable, its not right, people should not feel sad just because others are, you have to deny misery of company, because it lives off it.  Yeah well im done now.  Thanks for listening as always. Ben.

      Greetings mortals  Well what can i say, it has been far to hot today so i spent most of it cowering inside hopeing i dotn go all crispy vampire style woo.  But for all you normal people who can go outside without the tendancy of dieing when you do i hope you enjoyed it but i really really really want a thunderstorm tonight.  For the past two thursdays there has been a thunderstorm and i want one again tonight!  Bring on thunder thursday thats what i say!  Well anyway ive just finished watching my fave episode of buffy ever, (i cant believe i always forget about it)  its called 'The wish' and the cool thing is probably even non Buffy fans would like it because the majority of it is set in a alternate reality were Buffy never came to Sunnydale, and Willow and Xander are vamps YAY!  But however it is a rather sad episode *sniff* especialy when Oz kills Willow.  Why the hell did Oz have to leave  he was the best!  *Sigh* well anyway im still bored and pissed off with life at the moment but this artsy filled day has taken my mind off it somewhat anyway.  Hopefully gonna write some poems or something later for future website updates... but i dunno.  Well anyway happy thunder thursday and err bye!  Love Ben

      Heya everyone  Well today has been a day much like any other one for me at the moment, alonesy and boring... woo yay hoopla.  I also as of so far have done nothing creative today which winds me up a little but what winds me up more is that ive got nobody to talk to most of the time!  ARR!  Where you all gone :(  Ohh well anyway still havent heard about the job for the Derby evening telegraph (curse their oily hides) and with everyone shazaming off to hotter nicer places (or just the furthest place away from me) i think im going quite mad.  Lol well not as mad as our next door neighbour, she is always killing our plants in the garden and this afternoon she said that the window cleaners could climbo on our roof!  (Our house is semi detached)  She's barking!  Plus her and her little yappy much and her annoying screaming chav grandchildren make me want to kill!  Yup thats another problem all my friends have dissapeared and it seems that in their place there has been a massive rise in the number of chavs hanging around near and on my street, with their stupid burb and gold chains... who the fuck do they think they are.  Plus to prove how stupid they are, they are actually scared of a fat labradour thats nearly 7 years old and cant run.   Pff chavs.  Also if blogger could grant me one wish today it would be, bring my friends back, get us free booze and strike all the chavs down with a pox on a rather sunny day.  If it could do that for me it would be swell.  Cheers for listening Ben

      Greetings.  Hey everyone, well lets just say i hope you all had a better day than me, yup its just been one of those days where you wish you'd slept all day and have absolutly no memory of it, almost like missing time.  Well what can i say, it was crap because of sevral reasons really.  I once again had to much time to think about myself and how fucked up i seem to be able to make everything.  You know i really do wonder sometimes how can i possibly be this wrong in other peoples eyes, i mean am i not a human being just like them, obviously not.  Obviously there is some law, or some hidden code in life which means everyone can treat me just how they like and i really dont have the right to any feelings or beliefs.  Just so fucking pisses me off the way some people treat each other, i mean can they not see what bastards and bastardets they are being to each other?  I really dont think so anymore.  Another thing thats bothering me at the moment is my hair.  I mean as you all know i used to have it really long and then i got it cut quite brutal, but the weird thing is its growing back really fast... i mean it couldnt have been a month ago since i had it short, now my back is touching my shoulders and my fringe is in my eyes again... so weird.  I dont want to have it cut but no doubt soon parental pressure will build up again and i will have people heckling me in the street again... probably more so than usual.  Because im sure plenty of you know what kind of shit i get shouted at me... hmm chavs, well probably more than just chavs.  But yeah talking of parents, ive been told i get the house to myself while they go on holiday for two days next week, and get this they said if i have any form of a party they will disown me.  The freaky thing is they aint kidding, my dad disowned my sister when she was like 16 for 6 months or something, i was quite young at the time but i do remember some serious shit went down. *sigh* they are such fucking narks, they get to go on their shit little dirty weekend or whatever the fuck it is and i get nothing but me and Peter (my dog) alone in the house for two days.  Another shitty thing is that i still havent heard from the Derby evening telegraph, they said id hear from them like now!  grr.  I mean why cant they just tell me i suck and fuck off again out of my life.  But nobody on this earth seems to have the true power to tell someone "hey just fuck off."  Why is that? I mean if you dont like or want someone associated with you anymore just tell them, just dont let people hang on, cut the strings.  So now in this influential month that is August it seems that life, time and excistance has just seemed to blur out for me.  *sigh*  Thanks for listening Ben.

But please any suggestions or if you want any of your own stuff on the site, and i cant stress enough its gotta be your own please just let me know and i will be overwhelmingly happy to put it in for you.  Well in other news this week, it is now august so any day now i will be hearing from the Derby Evening Telegraph telling me wether i have the colum job i have been hunting for or not!  So mesa a bit worried about that!  Hehe well we gonna have to organize something to take our minds off it because face it August is gonna be a really big month for us all with the exams and everything so anyone who wants to invite me to get drunk with them or anything im more than happy to lend my presence :P  Hehe well anyway hope to talk to all of you on MSN later, so err until then i will leave you with this website  urlLink here  were thee can listen to a song by the band panic cell which ima gonna go see in September!  w/y/h!
