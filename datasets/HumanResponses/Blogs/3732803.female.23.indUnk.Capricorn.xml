         I have a dream that I have had for many years. This dream is to be a suit and tie   kind of person.       I have always wanted to do this for it makes me feel good and feel professional, it   also has to do with the fact that it is I can help people and offer them a service and   give them a quality product.      From the time I was little I always had this thought in the back of my mind and it   never really occurred to me that I could do this if I really set my mind to it, all it   took was me falling down two flights of stairs and back surgery to make me realize that   this dream can be mine if I really want it.      Now it is not just a dream it is going to be true. I have been in school for one and   a half years and am going for my A.A.S degree in Sales, Marketing and Management. With   this degree I can do a assortment of jobs, but my main passion is to be in the sales   field.       One can dream but it is that dream you can turn in to reality in a short time if you   put time and effort behind it and passion to make it a success. For me to be successful   one will need to use there knowledge and the education to get them that dream job and   one shall never stop excelling.

       “Conversation you over heard”  	I feel with this prompt it is the hardest to write on. I am the biggest advocate on listening to other peoples business. I learned this from my father and my elders. If one is open to listen to other people then how much are you really listening to what is being told to you. To me the worst part is that people that do over hear things go out and tell other people on what they heard. Can’t people just let things be and let nature run its course? 	I have gone through 23 years in my life and I really can’t recall one time I stretched my ear to hear what others we saying. If there is one thing that I have stuck to most is what others say our think they heard is not true and not worth there time as a friend. 	Overall this prompt was a bad subject for me for I have strong feelings against one who does such a thing and should be punished in my book.

       “What makes people enjoy what they do?”  	What makes you enjoy what you do? Is it the enjoyment of doing something good with your time our do you feel good about that you did something to help others. To me it is when I wake up in the morning and get dressed to go to school our to work. To me doing either of these things is something  I enjoy doing, for both ways I am learning a valuable lesson you can’t just get from anything but through the enjoyment of wanting to be there and to learn. But for anyone to enjoy something you must want to be there and willing to learn, but most of all when you go home at night you feel that you have did something today and made a difference in someone else’s life. If you feel your not happy when you go home, then maybe you should sit back and take a look at why your working there.  If it is for the money then your not enjoying your job. I have been told and learned that if you do something for just the money then your not having fun doing it, because your just there for yourself. If one wants to enjoy themselves they need to have fun with what they do and think of other before themselves.

       “Tough Lesson I Learned”  	I remember the day so well; it was April 28th back in 2000. It was a nice spring day; sun was shinning and not a cloud in sight. It was around 9:30 in the morning and we were sitting in class of my senior year. Us guys got this great idea; we should have a senior skip day.  We all convened and thought of the plans, where we should go and of course were kids yet. Young and dumb we needed alcohol. We spent the first few hours trying to get someone to buy for us and we finally found someone and we went back to the spot where everyone was at. That day was such a blurry to me but do remember it came to the end of the day around 4 o’clock and we decided to reorganize at another person’s house to party.  Well one of my friends needed a ride to town to get his car, so off we went I don’t remember driving there but do remember when we got to the schools parking lot. I dropped him off and started to whip figure 8’s in the parking lot. Well that wasn’t good enough, I went up to gas station and bought some food, as I left there I spun my tires and little to long and here come the light flashing and the sirens roaring.  I stop and I am arrested for a DWI. The moral of the story is never drink and drive in this case I should’ve never skipped school. Worst thing was I lost my license a day before my senior prom.

       “ Most intense Ten minutes of my Life”  	It all happened on the day of April 16th of 2004. At 5 am I arrived at the hospital all ready to have my back surgery and was told to take all my clothes off and put my gown on, for my surgery was going to start at 7:30 am that morning. Time went by and never seemed that I was going to have my surgery that day.  All of a sudden the doctor knocks at the door, finally its 8:30 am he said I am sorry about the delay. I thought it was for 9 o’clock this morning. Well he said I am on my way up, I will see you there.  So, here comes the nurse and gets me ready to head up to surgery. My sister and mother were there with me and got up and the nurse told them they could come up till we got to the holding room. So they wheeled me to the elevator, the door opens and closes and I hear one ding then the second came. The nurse says this is your floor so they wheeled me out and down the hallway. Just before I get to the holding room we stop, my mother and sister give me there goodbyes and good lucks and of course a kiss on the cheek.  As I was sitting in the holding room 5 minutes had passed since I left pre-op and now I am sitting in the holding room and then it came the sweats and chills, also the thoughts is this going to go well. As I sat there all alone in my thoughts, they move me into the surgery room now the excitement our was it worries, the nurse looks at me and says we are going to start a Ivy.  As she was doing this I squinted and tried looking at the nurse, through the mask I seen this beautiful person. I thought I know I am alright she good looking she can’t do no wrong our can she? They start the anesthesia and I replyed can I count down, they said yeah. So I did 99,98 OUT!!! like a light I was. Six hours later I am up from surgery and in recovery. All went well, now I am here in the world feeling a little better now with my back pain.

       Today was a good day, I started back at work after four months and have a wonderful girlfriend supporting me all the way. Today also brought to my attention a very important detail that really made me think, my girlfriend wrote me a offline message and told me how much she missed me and how much she loved me, granted we have only been together for only a week and a half, but to me it brought a new feeling of joy and scared me at the same time. This is what I have been looking for in a women for a long time but how did it just fall into my lap like this? We didn’t know each other, we never talked before, but she is the one that contacted me. So this is why I choose the great thing I always wanted and left the other behind.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My other was a girl that I found very attractive and sweet. Well now that she has called me a few times I have learned she isn’t what I want, for she is not looking for a serious relationship for a long time and she said it would take someone very special to convince her that she should change her mind. Now that I have made my choice I bring together what both can offer me and settle for one my girlfriend, she gives me all that I ever wanted but the other gives me a joy of surprise and wanting to know more but I know if I want the true thing you must stick with her and not the other.

       As I lay there on the porch, I lick myself and turn my head and look across the lawn and ponder the thoughts of when my next scraps from the dinner table will come our even a full dish of food to eat. Well I think to myself god do I have it nice our what?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My owner does all these things for me, he even gives me attention when I want it and I usually want to be petted every time I get to see him. I think to myself some days if he even really cares about me and then he always pulls something out of you know where. For instance just the other day I hear the front door open on the house and I see my owner walking out and he calls my name and we walk outside and I turned my head and saw three of those dam red squirrels. My owner by now realizes why I took off when he was talking me and he bolts back into the house. I knew what he was up to, he was getting the gun.

       As I go through a person’s yard, I always seem to notice the places where trees are, and where the flower beds are. These objects have always been my pet peeve, because if there is one thing I hate the worst is a poorly taken care yard. I can go into my yard and look how things are laid out and pick and choose what trees need to be trimmed and what ones need to go completely.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the worst time with a certain breed of tree called the Box Elder, to me they are the most worthless trees known to man kind except for Cotton Wood trees. These trees are weeds and act like one to, for they hardly ever grow straight our have a good root system to keep them from falling down.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a time last summer I was sleeping and my mother yells upstairs to me at 5:45 AM to tell me it was dark in the living room because a tree fell on the house. Sure enough I get out of bed and get dressed and call my boss to tell him I was going to be late. I go outside and yep just what I thought a Box Elder had fallen. If I would’ve watched this tree more I would’ve seen that it had been cracking on the trunk of the tree and it needed to be removed.

       Women today are what we all think of as our heroes. There are millions of men that feel that there is no place for women in the military, but they hardly ever think of what it would be like if there weren’t any women.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way I thought in my younger years was that women were always meant to stay home and cook and clean and have that hot meal waiting for you when you came home from work. Now it is totally the opposite the men have the meal waiting and house cleaned, but there are some drawbacks with women in the service for they are still fighting the sex difference with there pay and there duties that they care out everyday.

       One may go threw life and as a student and wonder what was important to learn and what wasn’t. I myself went threw school wondering what English was really needed for, it to me is the proper ways to write and speak but really means nothing to me for my most important thing I learned and love very much today is Math.   Math for me came easy; I looked at numbers and saw a new world at hand. This never seemed like something that was important but something I knew and I wanted to do and seemed that it was the only thing I was really good at. Now it is something that I hold close to me and realize that it is a important thing for a student to learn. Math can get you to a lot of different jobs and places, for if one didn’t know how to count money they wouldn’t know how to buy things are to mange it.

       Death really can’t be really judged on the greatest loss in life. One can take a loss of a loved one as a growing point in life. I myself lost my father when I was 16 and today I feel closer and stronger knowing he is inside me in many different ways. I see it when I go to town, if my dad was good for one thing if he needed to go to town he would get there fast but if not he would drag his feet. I guess I am the same way now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death is represented to me as a gift for I believe in reincarnation.&nbsp; It is important for me to think this way because there is always life after death, if it’s not going to heaven but having another life as someone else. I feel that since my dad had gone my relationships with my siblings having growing to a new level for they are seeing my dad in me. If its from my personality our my looks one always sees my dad in me.

       &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through hardship and despair one can always find help in our government with their daily needs to live. One will always have a place that they can go home to at night for our government and our four fathers gave us this, and we can get help along the way with our problems with all the programs that are offered through the government.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the government would just take another look at our people and not at all the third world countries that are starving and help its own more. There would be more people that approved the government programs and even those that abused the programs would be held responsible and those who needed it wouldn’t be judge on those that did.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself can go back to times that the government has really helped me out in hardship; right now even they are helping me with finding a different job and with my schooling. Without the help with my school I don’t know if I would be here today typing away.

       I am always the one that never went out of my way to look for fights. In todays world no one should relate to physical violence. You always see fights going on from the T.V our the bar. Why do people to this to one another. Words to all of us hurt worse then anything.   If one wants to fight they are choosing a wrong solution to there problems. There is always better ways of doing things to take care of problems. Like to sit down and talk things over our just walk away from the whole situation. All together we all should work together and create a world without violence and keep working towards it.

       It was about 2 months ago now and I meet a good looking gal here at college. So I happened to prosure this gal and asked her out. So after we've talked for a couple of weeks she asks me over to her place and she has a kid well I knew this coming in but never bothered me. So as like any first meetings I was totally nervous.  So one week and another past by. It was going great and I am the type that is always looking for the one our love, however one says it. Well it happened to be a weds. night and I went over to her place and she was really tired from working and staying up realy late from the night before. So after I was there for a couple of hours she was kinda sleeping so I suggested I should go and she said stay longer I said no I better go so you can get your sleep. Well she said ok, but for sure your staying with me Friday and there is no ands ifs our butts.  Well Thursday came no phone call ok no biggie, Firday comes no call again. By this time I was worried and Saturday came and still haven't heard from her so I took off that afternnon to see her and she said I am so sorry but I was out last night and got a little drunk. I told her that was fine but I was worried and she should of at least tried to leave a message for me.   Well all and all this really keep going like this for two weeks her not calling our wanting to see me so I went to see her one last time and to find out what was going on. So we talked and she told me I was blowing things out of hand, I said no, I told you how I fall hard and easy if you didn't want this to go anywhere why did you let it come this far. Well I am so sorry but right now I am so busy working and stuff I can't find time. I said thats fine but I can't wait around and see if you want this to go somewhere. So I left and haven't seen her since.  What this relationship taught me is always be open and ask if things are going anywhere. For I will never change the way I want things to just be dragged along to find out she didn't want it from the start.

       It was my senior year in High School when I recall a certain someone always showing off. One day I really think I saw the worst of him showing off it was May 3rd 2000 are senior prom. He was always trying to be that certain person always in the center and get everyone’s attention.  	The event that bothers me the most is this prom we had a hypnotist there. Well he asked for volunteers and he went up off course and everyone else that wanted to go up did. So as everyone was put in a trance there he sits looking as dumb to me as ever. I did not like this guy and to this day don’t. So the hypnotist did his usually kind of things with having one person cluck like a chicken and another stand up and dance. 	Well finally it came down to this certain someone he was sitting there, to me I think he was dumb enough and smart enough at the same time to make it look like he was in trance. So the hypnotist says “you’re in a crowded room and you’re dancing and all of a sudden your date farts, not loud. You know the silent but deadly kind and it really stinks and you leave because of it.” So this went on for awhile with this guy and after everyone wakes up he is the center of attention and he’s laughing and I am thinking to myself he doesn’t need any more attention. 	So as the night goes on he is talking with everyone and reminds people of what he did like he was there, but he really wasn’t our was he?

       As I sit here, I ponder what someday means. I want to say is that someday I will be married and have kids. Our someday I will be done with school and this will happen this December, so maybe this is someday to me. After contemplating these, I am totally not going to not have this someday.  	So someday I hope that I am going to be working in Australia and be there with my family. This someday is not going to be your average day, for this day will be celebrated like it was the best day of my life. On this day it will be my best day for all my childhood dreams will have been meet and I will finally be doing something I love doing being a sales manager for one of the biggest companies in Australia. This day I will be packing and deciding what I am going to wear at my first day of work. My work will not be your everyday kind of job, it will be some high paying job that you will see me working in a three piece suit and I drive a Lexus.  	Someday can be anyway which ever you decide to make that someday. But a someday is really a goal that one sets in life that you are working for from a distance but then you get a break, our schooling pays off. If one never wonders about that someday, just look at what you’re doing now and think that aren’t you really working towards that someday in your life?

       Hasn't everyone sat down and thought if I was only rich I could be happy. To all of us its happens and it happens for a reason, for you can only be happy if you get that new car our house.  But wait, can't you have all this if you work hard and don't take life as money? I can only be happy if I have a few extra dollars a month but granted it would be nice to have the millions to go play with everyday but then again I think I would have more heartaches then anything.  One can go through life and not have nothing and be happy and one can go through life a millionare and be misarible. It is all a person's choice of path they take when he or she grows up. It is the fact if you work hard you get everything you need.  It is like the old saying money can't buy love but it sure would be nice. I could do all these things with money, but it wouldn't be right. I would just buy all my friends my wife and my four perfect kids. Even at the end of the day a person could feel down but then you can buy yourself out of it.  All in all money can never buy your happiness it can only buy heartaches. If you every catch yourself thinking bout it remember what if all of a sudden you lose all the money,will the you partner stay? Our will you still have friends? it is your choice but never let yourself over think the idea you cn always be worse off and be dead. Be happy for who you are not the way you would want everyone else to see you as. You can only be happy if your happy with yourself.

       As I sit here pondering my life in the heartaches and the pressures I feel, I can't help but excape this and go to my little special place.   My place is just sitting back and wondering through my thoughts and trying to resolve them in my mind, I do this by thinking of that one place where I want to be and it is always Australia. Why do I go there is for I can lose myself in the thoughts of all the fun I could be having and let my problems come to there own ends without giving myself a heart-attack.  Every time I go here I seem to forget my problems and my dispear to the beautiful sand and the nice warm weather. Living in Minnesota can be rough and can be nice but overall I feel that there is something I am missing from my life. I can only resolve these downs by going to my place and escape the daily garbage I deal with day in and day out. To go to this beautiful place it doesn't take alot but a go imagination and the solitude to make it all right.  For anyone who has wanted that excape sit back relax and think off that one place that gives you that extra special kick and to make it all right again. I do it all the time it makes me a better person for doing it.

       It today's society men are able to cry and express themselves. One can never decline a person the right to express themselves if that means by them crying out loud.  One in the past would have said no, a man wasn't suppose to cry for it was not part of being a man. If one did I am sure things were not good for him. Just thinking bout it he probally was thought of as a weak person for crying, and it was all in part that is was thought of as the fittest will survive and if a man cried he couldn't survive the pressures of working and family life.  Over the past and present, a man is able to what he wants and should be gien that chance to cry. It doesn't make you a lesser person and it is to me more thought of as he needs to do it for a women loves a sensitive guy and she wants him to express himself in a diffrent way.

      Something We Neglect  With many moves behind me, I have come to realize the one most important thing that is lost the most are friendships. We tend to create good friendships in places that we are but when the stress of time and distance are placed on these "frindships" the friendship tends to fall apart. As much as we would like to think that we are going to continue our friendship over the distance that is placed between us, the reality of it may be different.  Many times I have moved from one place to antother with a "good bye" card in my purse. On that purse are the names and envelopes of those "friends" that I want to keep in contact with. These are also the friends that want to contanct me, "when they are in town."   Time goes by as new jobs, school, family, just life in general zip by you. Before you know it, there are weeks that have passed and the friend that you couldn't go a day without talking to, has not called. Nor have you called them back. We seem to neglect what is important to us. It seems easy to neglect what is not right there at our disposal. Our vision of life  becomes so blured with what is right there in front of us, we forget to see those standing on the side lines of our life.  Our friendships become former and our lives are now filled with playing phone tag and listening to phone messages about the lives of our friends. We want so much to be there and yet can't even seem to find the time for a simple phone conversation to say, "Hello, I miss you."

      A Dream I Had  The first time that I was an airplane was an eye opening experience. There were so many new and extravagant things to me. First there was the airport with all the shops, people, and security. Then there was working up the courage to get on the plane while my mom pushed me along. I was sure that I was going to die that day. Once we were in the air, there was the most amazing thing of all. The flight attendants.   Their uniforms were pressed, their shoes were polished, and their smiles were so cheery and perfect! What a job that would be. I dreamt of flying around the world passing out peanuts and smiles to all. What a great job. Everyone was so happy. I finally had a dream. I wanted to be a flight attendant.  I held that dream in my head for a long time. However, I doubted that an overweight, frizzy haired girl with low self confidence could ever be as pretty as the flight attendants I had once seen. With a lot of courage and positive self talk like, "you know you can do this" and "no one is better then you," I walked into an interview with Ryan International Airlines. After a grueling interview, I was given a time and a place to go for orientation. I think I got the job!  Little did I know that there was a lot more to being a flight attendant then passing out peanuts and giving everyone a cheery smile. There was a lot of training and hard work. For the first few weeks of training, I felt like I was in boot camp. 8am to 6pm we sat in the classroom. If you were a minute late or got less then a 90% on the exams, you were sent home and told to re-apply next season! What a nerve wracking experience for such a dream, I thought.

      A Wonderful Imperfection in My Family  To many people having an alcoholic in their family may seem like a horrible imperfection. However, I am proud to say that I was fortunate enough to have one in mine. The alcoholic was my father.   As a child, I never understood why Mom would be so furious at Dad when he would come home at any time of the night or day. Now I understand that is was due to the fact that he was more then likely drunk or had just quit his job. Because of this insecurity caused by my father's addiction we never had much money. Mom never knew if it was going to be a week that she would buy milk or buy bread. Buying milk and bread in the same week was far too extravagant for our family.   My father and I were never very close up until a few years ago. My dad has been through a lot in his life. It is true that we as his family have as well been through a lot, but I feel he has dealt with more. He didn't choose his disease but was strong enough to fight against it when he knew that he would loose his family if he did not. This struggle for my father has made him a very strong and faith filled person.  Having to go through his own struggles in life has brought my father and I closer. He has been able to support me through my own struggles. He is the only one in my family that understands struggles which I have had to face. As a person, I have also grown to appreciate what I do have. Having to do with so little growing up has taught me to appreciate the car that I have, the milk and bread that is on the table, and the husband that comes home each night. Without our family's wonderful imperfection, my father would not be the same wonderful man that he is today nor would my view of the world be as it is.

      Elizabeth Engum Composition I Julie Lundblad June 26, 2004  Reaction to “The Perfect Family”  In this essay, Alice Hoffman questions what a perfect family really is. She describes what was believed to be the “perfect family” in the 50’s when she was growing up. Also, she describes her single parent family that did not fit the stereotyped “perfect family”. Alice Hoffman’s description of her mother taking the trash out to the curb on Monday nights as being the father’s job in the eyes of the neighbors really gives good insight into what the “perfect family” was thought to be when she was growing up.  I think that the ideas people had back in the 50’s about the “perfect family” are not too far from what some people believe now. Many times, I think that people feel having both a mom and a dad at home is what makes a child loved and happy. People tend to forget that not every parent is a good parent. I feel that one good parent can many times be more beneficial to a “perfect family” then two parents that are fighting and not happy.  I know what it is like to live in that “glass house” and have to maintain the look of a “perfect family” to the public. I find it very refreshing to read about a family that was not “perfect” in the eyes of the society of the time, but was a happy and loved. My favorite part of the essay was when Hoffman stated, “As far as we were concerned our mother could cure a fever with a kiss. This may be the only thing we need to know about love.

      “I Want a Wife” written by Judy Brady is an essay that seems to rally for sympathy for wives. Brady explains throughout the essay all of the reasons that she would want a wife and what she would expect them to do. She also writes that if she had a wife she would have the right to find a new wife if she so desired. I get the feeling that Brady, a wife herself, does not like the position that she is in.  &nbsp;  There is a very strong idea presented in this essay that wives have many expectations placed on them by there spouse, family, and society. These expectations are expressed in a negative way in this essay. For two entire pages Brady writes phrases and ideas such as, “I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean.” “I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied.”  &nbsp;  I don’t feel that there is anything wrong in wanting a wife to do these things. However, I get the feeling from this essay that Brady does not get the same respect from her spouse as she is expected to put out. I feel that each spouse has a role in there family. If my husband were to make enough money that I could stay home, I would. I would then have no problem doing all of the cooking, cleaning, pleasuring. Reality however, is different. In the real world of today, many families have both spouses working. When this is the case, the husband and wife should share the house hold responsibilities.  &nbsp;  I strongly feel that if life is so rough for Brady, then maybe she should start looking for a new husband just as their friend is looking for a new wife.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver’s essay “My World Now” is a very insightful essay about the treatment of elderly people in nursing homes. It also allows us to see what people in nursing home are thinking day to day. Seaver exposes the idea that nursing homes are very lonely, not very dignifying, and very boring.  &nbsp;  All of these ideas go through my very own head at work everyday. I work in a nursing home and often wonder how boring it must be. Everything seems to be revolved around breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and finally another snack. Seaver’s expresses this when she describes her day of getting up early, waiting for breakfast and then pondering waiting in the dining room for lunch. Obviously she feels that there is not much to look forward to during the day other then the meals that are served.  &nbsp;  Seaver expresses the idea that aides in a nursing home don’t take time to listen. I know that this is a fact. Many times, I find that we are very short on help and even though we would like to take time to chat, we just don’t have that luxury. I feel it a tragedy that we are forced to run around like chickens with our heads cut off when all these people want most of the time is someone to listen. I also think that people are encouraged not to get too close to the resident by spending a lot of time with them. I have had experiences where I was taking the extra few minutes that I had to visit with a certain resident who was telling me all about his kids. When I was spotted doing this by a co worker, I was told that I shouldn’t get so close. I didn’t look at this as getting close; I looked at it as caring.  &nbsp;  Overall the feelings that are expressed in this essay are very much valid. I can not imagine having to live in an environment like a nursing home especially if I had my mind about me as Seaver does in this essay.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learn best by doing things myself and knowing what they are like. If I do not do things for myself, I will always wonder what the harm is in them. I have not lead a wild life full of drugs and parties, but I have had my own struggles with my inner self and the need to experience life on my own. At the age of 18 I promptly moved out of my parent’s house to a town that was 3 hours away. In this town I was only knew two people. One was my ex boyfriend and the other was a “family friend.” I moved in with the family friend who allowed me to stay out all night and do whatever I pleased. I smoked, did some drinking, and experimented with many other aspects of life. In retaliation to my strict upbringing, I got my nose, tongue, eyebrow, and inner ear pierced, along with multiple tattoos. Through the years, from these experiences, I know that I don’t need my piercing to express myself, my tattoos remind me or my experiences, and I know that I am okay with who I am. I don’t feel that I would be as sure of myself without experiencing these things.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband on the other hand, has learned a lot of his lessons through taking example from his sisters “rough” life. Through seeing her do the things that she has done such as drugs, alcohol, and partying, he decided that those things in life were really not that important. He is what I refer to at “straight laced.” He tell me that I am the kind of person who has to touch a hot pan to make sure that it is hot even if someone tells me it will burn.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things to be learned from others, and many to be learned by trying things out for oneself. Not everyone is as lucky as I was to be able to stop my destructive life and learn from it. However, when I look at my husband’s life, I think that some people would be bored with it. Some people end up ruining there lives by testing the hot pan as I have and would have been better off to learn from others experiences.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so excited! There are so many new people at the house; so many new smells, faces, and hands to sniff. Mom and dad are cooking, mixing funny colored drinks, and everyone is laughing. Most important though, everyone is playing with me. Throwing my ball, petting my head, and testing my new learned commands, I love it. I am the center of attention; so many things going on and all eyes are on me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it is! Another knock on the door, more people are here to see me! I can’t wait to see what new smells they bring to my party. I can’t wait to jump up and welcome them! Welcome, welcome, to my house where I live with mom and dad. What’s this? There is another little dog here. I can’t believe someone dared to bring another dog into my house. This house is all about me. Oh well, I guess I can share.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I follow this little dog all around the house. He is okay here as long as he doesn’t touch my toys. My toys are all mine and he better not lay a paw on them. I am aghast that mom and dad are playing with him, not me! This is not right! They are my mom and dad, not this little muts. He is a mut! Nothing more, just a mut! He is so little; I could swallow him up in an instant; never to be seen again. Now mom is holding him. What is she thinking; this mut is not hers, she is my mom! I have had enough; I must stop her right now. I am going to bark and growling until she puts that thing down! Why are they telling me to be quiet? Have I no rights in my own house.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes! I am winning, finally dad gave mom a glare and she took the mut outside. I hope she stomps on it! I knew dad was my favorite for a reason. He loves me, he knows that I am his; he knows that I am special. He is not like mom. I can’t believe that she even touched that ugly little ungrateful worthless mut. Does she not know that I can sit, stay, and fetch? Does she not know that this little mut is worthless? I feel so betrayed; my own mother has forsaken me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party is now over; I will go to my room in the garage and think about how my mother has forgotten about me. In the morning, I will show her a lesson. I will not let her near me with her hand full or mut germs, and her heart dripping with ice!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning has come, I have to pee! How much longer do I have to bark before someone will let me outside? Ah, there is dad; my dad, my wonderful dad. Where is mom? I bet she is sleeping dreaming of that mut! I can’t wait to go inside where I will ignore her. I will not sit, I will not stay, and I sure as heck will not fetch. Not for her anyway! I was hers and dads, but not anymore. I love my dad, mom can find another dog!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An un-mowed lawn, a cluttered kitchen, sox on the floor, and dirty cars are all things that bother me. There is nothing more irksome then getting out of my car from a long day of work to find that the grass is not mowed, the living room contains magazines scattered about, and the dishes from my room mates supper three nights ago are still in the sink along with the pizza box from last nights party. Not that there is still pizza in there to be saved. It is empty. Sitting on the counter screaming filth and unneeded clutter!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can walk through the grass that is brushing my shins because it is so long. I can step over the magazines that are in the living room. I can forgive the dishes that are in the sink. I can not tolerate the empty pizza box! The empty pizza box has no excuse! One can run out of time to mow the lawn, pick up the magazines, or do the dishes. Throwing away the pizza box however takes no time. There is no reason for it to sit out longer then one drunken night. Even with a hang over, one can manage to throw away the pizza box as they walk by. But no, the pizza box remains along with the long grass, magazines, and dirty dishes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all of this clutter, I can not concentrate. I find myself torn away from my homework to cut the grass, wash the dishes, pick up the magazines, and yes…throw away the pizza box. I do not do this as a favor to my room mates. I love them dearly, but this is not for them. This act of cleaning the house is not for their well being. I do this for me. A purely selfish reason, I do this for my own sanity, concentration, and well being.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up, my mother would always start our “cleaning day,” which was Friday by cleaning the kitchen. She said that a clean kitchen was the most important part of a house. We did not have much as I was growing up, we did however have a very clean kitchen. I guarantee there were no empty pizza boxes on mom’s counter top. The grass at home may have gotten long from time to time, there may have been a few of my dad’s hunting magazines laying around, but there were no empty pizza boxes!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After cleaning the house, I feel an strong sense of relief. I can relax; work on my homework, and most of all focus. I can focus on the things that I need to focus on. The grass is perfectly cut, the dishes are all put away and clean, the magazines are organized, and that damn pizza box is in the garbage where is belonged as soon as the last slice was consumed. I am calm; everything is in its place.

      If I Were Gone 	I often think of what my family would do if I were to die. If I were to die tomorrow, what would my family do with all of my belongings. If my husband and I were to both die at the same time, I would hope that it would be in a house fire where my family could not go through all of my stuff. I don’t have anything scary or unlawful in my house. However, there are always the pictures taken at parties or on spring break or the “gifts” I received at stagget parties that I know my family may not understand. These are things have certain meaning to me. They may not make sense to someone else but they are important to me. They remind me of the fun times that I have had with friends and the lighter moments of my life. 	After I am gone, I would hope that my family would take the stuff that I have and enjoy the memories with me that are contained in some of the seemingly worthless belongings that I have held onto.  	When I am gone my family may be surprised to see the picture that I have of my father in his army uniform that was taken when he was twenty that is in my top dresser drawer. They may not expect to find the collection of crafts that I have started and not finished. Some are gifts that have never been given and some are simply just ways to pass my time. My family may be disturbed my the pictures that were drawn in my despressed youth. These pictures that I have kept are to remind me of places that I have been. They lead me to appreciate where I am now. I would hope that they would realize they were from the past and not from the present.

      Behind Words 	I get a lot of complements on my resume. I have even had people ask me to create one for them. This is not because I had a wonderful array of experience. It is because I have become very good a using big words. To some people this is impressive. I don’t know if they are more impressed with my actual job experiences or are just awed by the words that I used. 	Growing up, I spent countless hours listening to my father speak at church or to the video camera in preparation for a speech. He is a very intelligent man. He has a very extensive vocabulary. You see, why do I say extensive? I could have just as easily written the word big and it would have been the same thing.  	The resumes that I have written have been for jobs like secretaries, teachers (you would think a “teacher” could write her own resume, and for flight attendants. Many of these people had a lot of experience previous to applying for the jobs that they were, but through the use of creative words, they were able to hide themselves and appear more then competent. The people whom read resumes seem to be more impressed by extensive and grandiose jargon. There I said it!

      Dirt 	Dirt is a hard subject to write about. On one hand dirt seems to be completely worthless. On the other hand, how something so worthless can cost so much to buy. Who would have imagined hundreds of years ago when settlers were fighting over purchasing pieces of land, we would now have to buy truck loads of dirt. Not even dirt is free.  	People complain about the price of gas. Why not complain about having to buy dirt? Dirt is not something that we are in danger of losing as a resource. Dirt is easily made. Let some garbage rot and decay of a few years….there you go, you now have dirt.  	Dirt is not as simple as one might think. There are different kinds of dirt. You can not call a landscaping business and order dirt. If you do, you will be asked, what kind of dirt you are looking for. There is black dirt, sand, and clay to name a few.  	Where I grew up, there was no black dirt. Only sand. Sand is good for things such as digging in. it is not as hard to dig in as clay or black dirt.

      Ambivalence  Do I stay or do I go. A question I ask as I put in my two week notice at the job that I have had for the past three years. I have gained a lot of knowledge from this job; I have gained a lot of headaches as well. The people that I have to wait on drive me crazy; there is that one little old lady that comes in whom I will miss greatly. I hate making out the schedule for all the employees; I love making my own schedule. I can’t believe that one person can feel so many contrasting thoughts for the same job. How can it be possible to hate something with every bone in your body, yet feel as though you will miss it at the same time?  	These are all questions that go through my mind every time that I leave a job to take another. The “perfect” job always seems to turn out not to be so “perfect.” The same people whom I love to wait on begin to wear on my nerves as they tend to think that they are in some sense “more important” then others just because I remember that they like two sides of ranch dressing and extra crackers with their soup. On the other hand, the crabby old lady that was so “rude” the first time she came in, I now know and look forward to seeing each night around eight.  	The perks of being the “manager” are at first wonderful, but now make me dread stepping foot into the place. The ever so sweet little old waitress whose been working there for the past twenty years, is not so sweet as she doesn’t always get her way. The crabby waitress who works every weekend and no one else wants to deal with, I have realized knows more about managing a restaurant then the owner himself. She is just crabby because no one will listen to her as they think she is just being rude. I have come to enjoy her honesty and scorn the sight of the sweet little old waitress.

      Sitting in front of me I see a bottle cap. Not just any bottle cap, but a cap off of a water bottle. This cap is not needed fore the bottle it self has no problem sealing. There is already a push down top on this bottle of water. Here sits the cap. I want to throw it away, but because it came with the bottle and I feel there should be a use for it, I will not. Instead it will join the many other water bottle caps at the bottom of my bag where it will lay in rest. What an amazing waste of plastic! I wonder -- how many useful things could be made out of all the useless bottle caps in the world? As a child I probably would have come up with some use for it. Perhaps it could be converted into a lampshade that would be used in my many cardboard Barbie houses, or a salad bowl for Barbie to serve Ken dinner in. My husband would probably just role his eyes and laugh at me right now for sitting here in actually thinking about the wonderful possibilities this completely meaningless cap has.   I have never really written about my husband before. I have included him in many a story and occasional speech. He is a large part of my life after all. Every time that I am around him, to this day, I think of how we met. I was sitting in Perkins eating a sandwich. Over my shoulder, I notice that there were a group of cops across the restaurant from where I was. The back of my head was burning; I knew that one of them was watching me. I was not flattered, instead I was nervous. Why was this cop staring at me? I was not about to give him the opportunity to make eye contact. Instead, I ate my food and watched him leave. Relieved that the cop left and didn’t come talk to me, I myself left. Eight hours later I was laughing and visiting with friends at the bar I worked at. In walked that cop. We locked eyes! I knew that he knew that I knew he saw me earlier. I just ignored him and kept on visiting with my friends while he walked by and played pool with his friends. Later that night, while I was still ignoring him, he came over and asked me if I was in Perkins earlier. Crap!

      The mall is a place in which I find much attraction. When I think of my favorite mall, I think about the Mall of America. This is a place in which I was everyday. I worked there for three years. Not only did I work there, I loved it. There were so many things to see. Signs from store fronts of every different color engulf me as I walk through the door. The thunder of footsteps, kids playing, and people talking rumble in my ears. People walking, some fast, some slow. They zip by as if to find the next “great deal.” The smell of food tantalizes my nose. Corn dogs, fresh doughnuts from krispy crème, and pretzels are just a few of the smells leading me through the mall.  In this mall I see one of my favorite things of all, a bright florescent pink sign announcing, “California Café,” my favorite place to eat. Also, my favorite place to work. At work, I am greeted by Chuck, my manager. 	It has been a long time since I have thought about Chuck, but he was by far the kindest funniest boss that I have ever had. He knew how to do his job and was still fair and humorous to be around. Never would he degrade you even if a customer was angry with you. I remember several occasions when we would laugh at our pre shift meetings. These meetings we would have before the start of every shift. Chuck would tell us about new wines that we had just gotten in from California. We would sample them, my favorite part, and then talk about the characteristics of it. Also, at these meetings we would sample new menu items that our chefs had created that day. Chuck was also a French Chef who knew a lot about foods. We talked about food and wine that I had never heard of. Chuck was always able to explain things to me in a way that made sense and in a way that didn’t make me feel stupid.

      A Wonderful Imperfection in My Family  To many people having an alcoholic in their family may seem like a horrible imperfection. However, I am proud to say that I was fortunate enough to have one in mine. The alcoholic was my father.   As a child, I never understood why Mom would be so furious at Dad when he would come home in the middle of the night or day. I understand now that is was due to the fact that he was drunk, had just quit his job, or a combination of the two. Because of this, my brother and I spent a a great deal of time with my aunt and uncle when we were children. They became second parents to us as we were there while Mom was working one of her three jobs.   Due to these circumstances of insecurity and what I now know as addiction, we never had much money. Mom never knew if it was going to be a week that she could buy milk or bread. Buying milk and bread in the same week was far too extravagant for our family. As a child, this was not unusual to me. This is how every normal family lived as far as I knew.   My brother and I were very close. I was his protector then and still feel the same. Once in a while, when my Dad did watch us while Mom was at work, it was my duty to take care of my little brother while Dad went over to visit friends. At the age of three, I was too young to know he was drinking there just as he was at home. Like I said, this was normal to me. I was perfectly happy watching my one year old brother. I knew how to change a diaper and knew where the cereal was in case we were hungry.   My parents separated when I was about to go into kindergarten. I don’t remember this as a truamatic time. I was only aware that my dad was living and working far away. He would come home on his motorcycle to visit us on the weekend. Mom drove the only car that we had. This was okay with Mom, myself, and my little brother because Dad was happy to see us and Mom was happy that Dad finally had a job. Although, he was living out of a tent on the river, he had a job none the less and that was all she wanted.  A year passed. My father still had that same job and found a place to live. He even had a new car that he would use to come and see us in! This was the first new car that I had ever been in. It was the fanciest car I had ever seen! There was no rust on the door or holes in the seats, just new shiny paint the smell of new dolls at Christmas! Mom and Dad said that the smell was “new car” smell. I could hardly believe that it was ours! In that new car, Mom, myself, and my little brother packed up all of our belongings and moved back in with Dad, who was living two hours away.  I hated where we were living. There was no family near, all of my friends were far away as well. I was very lonely. However, Mom was happier now because dad was going to meetings after work. I didn’t understand what these meetings called Alcoholics Anonomous were, but I did know that as long as Dad went, Mom was happy. If he did not return home immediately after one of his “meetings” or work she would pace the floor, watch out the windows, and stare at the clock until he returned sober and exhausted from work.   One chilly January morning I remember especially well as I awoke my father to surprise that I made for him. It was a sort of “birthday” cake my mom explained as she helped me to write a prayer she called the “Serenity Prayer” on it. That day marked the first full year that my father had gone without drinking. I was so proud of him and didn’t fully understand why. I just knew that everyone was happy that day.  Since that first year, my father started to go to church with the rest of our family every  Sunday, and eventually became a deacon in the Catholic church about eight years after he quit drinking. He has had the chance to help out many other alcoholics who were in need, much like himself. As a Deacon, he was  also able to perform the wedding ceremony and vows for my husband and I. Never would I have imagined that day which ended in a  father daughter dance. During this dance, my father and I sobbed on each others shoulders. He didn’t have to say anything, I knew that he was sorry for all the years past.   As a family, we have had to go through a lot, but I feel that he has gone through the most. He didn't choose his disease but was strong enough to fight against it when he knew that he would loose his family if he did not. This struggle for my father has made him a very strong and faith filled person.  Having to go through his own struggle in life has also brought my father and I closer. He has been able to support me through my own tough times. Times when no one else seemed to understand, he did. Without the my father, I would not have grown to appreciate what I have. Having to do with so little growing up has taught me to appreciate the car that starts every day, the milk and bread that is on my table, and the husband that comes home sober each night. Without my family's wonderful imperfection, he would not be the wonderful man that he is today nor would I see the world as I do.

      Elizabeth Engum Composition I Julie Lundblad July 2, 2004  Reaction to “One Hour”  	In this essay, Kim Dennig describes the life and death of her grandfather. She also tells us of the meaning that her grandfather had in her life. She tells of the father figure that her grandfather was to her being that she did not have her father in her life. Dennig describes all of the positive things her grandfather was in her life. He was her father figure, friend, and teacher right up until the moments before his death.  	Kim Dennig grabbed me from the very beginning as she states that it was a day that would go down in the history of her life. This statement had me curious right away. She held my attention by the vivid describing of her grandfathers love for her and the love that she held for him. Denning effectively illustrated this love in telling of how the family moved her grandfather’s shop in order for him to be able to continue his wood- working. His love was made evident for his family by the description of the Christmas gifts the family received from him twelve days after his death.  	In this essay, Dennig caused me to think of the passing of my own grandmother who had a birthday present made for me along with a baby blanket for my brother who was born two weeks after her death. This essay very much moved me. It led me to think of the love my grandmother had for us even though I was too young to directly remember her love. Most of all it brings me to realize just how important the love of family is to me.

      My Favorite Vacation  For a girl from "up north", the idea of a Christmas without snow may not seem like the ideal for a vacation. Florida is a warm spot in the winter and to a the 13 year old girl that I once was, it was a great.  Our family didn't have a lot of money so, when my parents told my brother and I that there were not going to be presents under the tree because we were all going to Disney World instead, we were ecstatic. After, we were told about the vacation, days seemed to drag on forever. My brother and I were sure that the day would never come that we would be standing at the gates of Disney World.  The day finally did come. Grandma brought our family to the airport and we got on the plane to Florida. It was all so new to Chris, my brother, and I. The smell of the airplane, the thought that this huge giant was going to fly, and the thought that soon we would be in the state of Florida. There was almost too much for us to grasp.  We were finally off the plane and awed by the sight of swaying palm trees, the smell of salt from the ocean, and the rush of the big city. This too was new to us. We were used to gravel roads. The biggest town closest to us had two stop lights!

      Write about something people neglect without meaning to   From my experience of when I was married for ten years, I find the one thing that people neglect without meaning to is to give each other compliments. I feel that after being together for ten years we started to take each other for granted. Before the divorce, we tryed counseling and the one thing I found that was actually helping and working was writing down the positive things about each other and we continued doing this for five weeks and then that counselor moved to the cities and our marriage ended shortly after that.  We didn't continue to do what he had planned for us that what actually was working.  Taking each other for granted is very easy to do so I feel it's very worthwhile to put in the time and find out each others interests.  This is not the only thing that went wrong in my marriage.  My ex-husband was never one to communicate.  He was like living with a ghost.  Either that or I just talked too much for the both of us.  Sometimes I would tell him that.  But seriously, there are things I needed to compliment or thank him for and I didn't.  Such as, for example, changing the oil on my car so I wouldn't need to drive sixteen miles to town to have it done or taking the time off work to come to my job and change my flat tire.  I was wearing white jeans that day so I did very much appreciate it but being he was my husband at the time, I just figured this is what he's supposed to do so this is what I mean by taking someone for granted.  This was in our ninth year of marriage.  Of course, this works both ways.  We both worked at Marvin Windows in Warroad, Minnesota for the big window company.  I worked there for four years and to this day he is still there.  In the four years we worked there, I would pack out lunches and help get our two girls to daycare and for me, a thank you would have been nice just as it would have been for him.  I know I packed good lunches because one guy at his table would tell him he would want his lunch box instead of his own. So this is why I feel people take each other for granted and neglect each other without meaning to.  I also feel it has just been crazy with the hustle and bustle of life but what would it hurt to just take these few extra moments after work to talk and just say, "Hey, I really appreciate all you do for me. Thanks for sticking by my side."  One of the other things I noticed is that I would always make chocolate chip cookies and within a week they were gone.  (This part is making me hungry)  He would just ask if I made a new batch of chocolate chip cookies and I'd start in by making more and that one of the things of neglect. No comments on how good they were but where's more instead.  I feel I neglect listening to my daughter without meaning to.  She always catches me when I am busy with the dishes or doing laundry or getting after my three year old and I do try to explain when I tuck her in at night she can tell me then and I'll have her write it down what she wanted to talk about and then I think, Man, what would it hurt to leave the dishes soak and listen to what she has to tell me so sometimes I will do that but once I give her an inch she takes a mile.  She has been helping me so much with my three year old that I have thanked her time and time again and what an angel she has been and then she gets this big smile and just grins from ear to ear.  So one thing people neglect without meaning to is each other sometimes.  This is important to me because my two girls, Bridget and Brittany are my life and also my three year old son, Riley.  It is very hard being a single mom but in the end it is all worth it.

      I have five brothers and three sisters. We all have been in a car accident.  We also are hard workers and have tempers, every one of us.  Some of us control our temper and some of us do not.  We all agree about our one brother being dropped on his head or something because he is definitely the class clown and is loud and obnoxious.

      Hi!  This is me, Bonnie. Welcome to my individual blog entry

      Today turned out to be a good day for me.&nbsp; I enjoyed getting something accomplished.&nbsp;   Yesterday started out with my son, Riley and his grandpa calling to see if we'd like to come over to pick peas from his garden.&nbsp; Brittany, my daughter, agreed to come with and help so on our way we went to Granpa Everetts' to pick peas.  Meanwhile, a van pulled up in the yard and this was Everett's son, Dale, and his three girls, Heidi, Holly and Ellie Mae.&nbsp; There Mom went to a reunion for the weekend.&nbsp; We enjoyed visiting and then Martha, the grandma, got off work and was home.&nbsp; Everett decided to take us all to Lengby, Minnesota for supper.&nbsp; They served walleye, chicken strips, and chicken drummies with a salad.&nbsp; The kids were pretty good and there was music.&nbsp; Ellie Mae started dancing.&nbsp; She is two years old and they're so cute at that age.  Shortly, after eating,&nbsp;we went to Everetts' where my daughter, Brittany wanted to spend the night.&nbsp; Riley and I went back to our house.  Today, we slept in some and took a bath and he couldn't wait to get back to grandpa's house to play with the girls.&nbsp; They live in Wahpeton so he doesn't get to see them often.&nbsp; Heidi is six years old and Holly is four years old.&nbsp; Ellie Mae, as I mentioned earlier, turned two years old in May.&nbsp;&nbsp;Riley also turned three years old in May and my daughter, Brittany is eleven years old.  While we were out there, I worked on essays I had for class to finish up.&nbsp; Grandpa made Brats on the grill and they were really good.&nbsp; He and Martha went to visit friends who were up here from texas so we decided to go fishing out on the pontoon at pine lake.&nbsp; The kids were all excited.&nbsp; Earlier, they were playing with kittens out on the farm and forgot all about them when pine lake and fishing were mentioned.  Dean and Dale went to get gas for the pontoon.&nbsp; I applied sunscreen to all the kids while waiting for them to return.&nbsp; They bought drinks for the kids and us also.&nbsp; We had three fishing lines going and Heidi caught a sixteen inch walleye that weighed a little over two pounds.&nbsp; We had lots of fun.&nbsp; My daughter enjoyed herself and even got the chance to drive the boat.&nbsp; So did one of Dale's girls, Holly, the four year old.  It turned out to be a beautiful day out on the lake with a fresh breeze just enough blow to hit for the cooling one needed from the sun beating down on us.&nbsp; It felt good.&nbsp; It was nice and relaxing.&nbsp; The kids behaved well for five of them on the pontoon.&nbsp; Roger owned the pontoon and helped get minnows on the hooks for the kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; There also was another couple along and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Riley caught a fish that got away before we got it in the pontoon.&nbsp; Heidi, the six year old, caught a northern that got away also.&nbsp; Scott, another guy, caught a fish that he threw back because he didn't feel like cleaning fish.&nbsp; Dale caught a ting northern, just a baby one that he threw back so the only one who caught something to keep was Heidi.&nbsp; She was very proud but unhappy when roger filleted her fish because she wanted her mom to see it.&nbsp; Good thing I had a camera in my purse since this is the first fish she has caught and has proof to show her fish to her mother.  We went to the lodge to see if grandpa and grandma were there and they were.&nbsp; Riley was getting tired and spilled M&M's on the floor so I decided to go home with him.&nbsp; He fell asleep about eight thirty.&nbsp; He looked pretty tired.  I decided to get my ceiling in the livingroom painted.&nbsp; I just had white ceiling paint.&nbsp; It still looks like it will need another coat.&nbsp; Since I was painting,&nbsp;I decided to do the walls in Dover White.&nbsp; They also need another coat of paint but at least now the walls are all the same color.&nbsp; What a job it can be.&nbsp; I'm not one for painting so I'll be glad when it is done.&nbsp; I feel there is a lot I accomplished today.&nbsp;   It is now after midnight and I hope to get a good nights' sleep in.&nbsp; I did relax with pop and popcorn for a few minutes when I wrapped up the painting stuff like the brushes and putting the lids back on the paint so I can start again tomorrow.  Brittany stayed the night again at Everetts' with the girls so when I get up, I'll go pick her up or call and see what time Dale is going back to Wahpeton.&nbsp; I just love good days like this with a memory created for the girls in the fun they had and my son, Riley.&nbsp; He was plumb, tuckered out from a fun-filled day.&nbsp; I hope there's more to come of days like this.&nbsp; The perfect day is what I'd call it.

      My dad now eighty three years old talks of the price of gasoline and how dramatically things have changed from his time.&nbsp; How different in the world today now.&nbsp; It's gone up again!&nbsp; It is on average at one dollar and eighty-eight cents.&nbsp; This is just ridiculous when the price of gasoline went up to over two dollars a gallon.&nbsp; How outrageous is that?&nbsp; I remember driving by wal-mart and telling my oldest daughter, "At these prices, Mom is going to have to quit school!"&nbsp; It was just getting to be too high of a price.&nbsp; I live forty-five miles away and round trip it takes a lot of gas, not to mention the wear of the tires. My three year old was on the riding lawnmower with me last week and I ran out of gas.&nbsp; We went to fill the gas can so I decided to fill my car too.&nbsp; It was over thirty dollars.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; When I got home, I told him to play on his swingset in the playpen until I get the grass mowed around the trees.&nbsp; He is three years old and mischievious.&nbsp; I filled the pushmower up with gas and left the gas can sitting within his reach.&nbsp; I had the inside of the fence to mow and he spotted this bright red can and starting dumping the gasoline on the ground.&nbsp; He's lucky I didn't tan his behind.&nbsp; I stripped his clothes, washed them two times in the washer and gave him a bath.&nbsp; He had gotten gasoline all over his pants.&nbsp; He had spiderman pajamas on that he refused to take off and wanted to wear them for the day.&nbsp; After getting gasoline all over and on the ground he had no choice but to go in the tub and get different clothes to wear.

      The crack in my windshield bothers me because I don't know how it happened.&nbsp; Isn't that glass to be made strong enough?&nbsp; Sometimes a rock chip when meeting a car or behind a truck flying at the window leaves an impression.&nbsp; I wonder what glass in made out of?&nbsp; I would think they would make a windshield strong enough to withhold a rock chipping the window but I suppose going down the road and this rock is flying up at sixty miles an hour, it's just lucky the whole window didn't shatter.&nbsp; I still can't figure out this one break in my window.&nbsp; It is on the passenger side and is spreading out like a spider.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is a baseball hitting it.&nbsp; There was an auction and I noticed it after the sale.&nbsp; Now the one crack in the windshield is cutting across getting close to the driver side.&nbsp; I have had people tell me that it looks like a break from the inside or the sun can do that to a window.&nbsp; I had to laugh.&nbsp; How cn the sun have done it when I had my car parked in the shade?&nbsp; The day was very hot.&nbsp; I guess to find out, I will never really know what happened, just that I need to get it fixed.&nbsp; It is still on the passenger side slowing innching its way to the driver side right where it is eyesight level.&nbsp; The crack coming across is by the mirror now and I'm hoping it will bend downward instead of hit at eye level.&nbsp; I don't want to get stopped for this cracked window.&nbsp; Someone told me once that the state trooper will do that.&nbsp; I would think it would need to be pretty bad for that to happen and with most of this in the upper right hand corner of the passenger side, I would think this isn't as serious as other car windows that I have witnessed in parking lots or the grocery story lot.&nbsp; Some cars don't even have a window.&nbsp; Other cars put up cardboard.&nbsp; Some cars use cheap plastic and some cars don't cover the window at all.&nbsp; I'm happy with the car I have now.&nbsp; I find myself grateful for the one I have when I see others driving cars worse than my own.

      Volleyball is a sport that I loved to play in high school.&nbsp; I wasn't the best player or the worse.&nbsp; I enjoyed every year that I played.&nbsp; I joined seventh through twelvth grade.&nbsp; I tryed other sports but this was my favorite and the one I enjoyed.&nbsp; One time I remember being the only one with a perfect serving record.&nbsp; My couch showed me the stats when were playing Adults against the eighth grade team.&nbsp; This sport is to be taken seriously with a couch or another way to see it is just to have fun out on the beach with friends in the warm sun.&nbsp; So this sport is an either/or situation.&nbsp; To have fun with it or to take it seriously.&nbsp; Whichever one to pick or choose, it is always a fun sport to me.

      Ever since I was three years old, I remember complaining of the back of my knees always hurting.&nbsp; My mom&nbsp;told me I'd run too much so I was to take it easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She would rub the back of my&nbsp;knees until I would fall asleep and&nbsp;the minute she would quit rubbing I would wake up immediately. Later on, during my teenage years, I ended up in the hospital with pnemonia for a week and lost forty pounds.&nbsp;  After that I kept having health problems.&nbsp; I ended up in the hospital&nbsp;again for a&nbsp;blood transfusion.&nbsp; I had to have three pints of blood&nbsp;that my brothers had to donate back because my mom and dad were too poor to pay for the bill. I ended up in the emergency many times for sprained ankles and wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors never could figure it out until 1986 when&nbsp;I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritus.&nbsp; That&nbsp;was in fosston, minnesota.&nbsp;Dr. Havens was the doctor at that time. He sent me to Dr. Lessard, a rheaumatologist,&nbsp;in Grand Forks, N.D.&nbsp; He&nbsp;had a bad bedside manner.&nbsp; I went to him for five years.&nbsp; One time he told me to&nbsp;drink a beer at night to loosen up.&nbsp; I was upset because my health was going to hell in a handbasket.&nbsp;  I took my health for granted, started to feel sorry for myself, and getting depressed on top of it. When I married, I had a little girl and I was&nbsp;overwhelmed with being a new mom.&nbsp; I had postpartum depression that&nbsp;I was not diagnosed for but I would cry over&nbsp;little things.&nbsp; The way she smiled, the way she cryed, etc... When in Warroad, I worked at Marvin Windows and&nbsp;was pregnant with my second child.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth month, I was sick from here on out with the&nbsp;pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born five weeks early and in the NICU in Grand Forks hospital for&nbsp;thirteen days.&nbsp; She was five pounds, seven and a quarter ounces.&nbsp; The doctors were&nbsp;stumped of her&nbsp;early delivery and I was scared myself.&nbsp; I started to have blackouts and had trouble walking.&nbsp; I&nbsp;stayed home four months and then returned to work.&nbsp; I brought in an American with Disibilities handbook and within&nbsp;minutes I had a sitdown job.&nbsp;I put up with a lot of sny remarks.&nbsp; It was aweful. I tryed other jobs and still was sick.&nbsp; I kept getting sick and slipping deeper and deeper into depression. Finally, to the doctor again.&nbsp; This was in warroad, mn&nbsp;and was diagnosed with Lupus.&nbsp; I was sent to the Mayo Clinc and there were various tests where I was diagnosed with a blood clotting disease, a thyroid problem, and lupus. I was put on medication and feeling much better.&nbsp; Then the depression hit me hard.&nbsp; I had a terrible job, my marriage was terrible and I ended up in the hospital for medication that worked against me. I became suicidal and was taken off of the drug.&nbsp; I got better eventually.&nbsp; I have been stressed and burdened with health problems tremendously.&nbsp; And now, I still have problems but do the best I can to cope with what is a lifelong experience that won't go away.

      I would love to fix my house but have little money to do this on.&nbsp; The basement is one thing I really would like to get done but I don't see that happenind for a while.&nbsp; I decided to concentrate on my living room so thursday I went to Menards in Grand Forks to price out everything I need.&nbsp; I was having fun.&nbsp; It's going to cost me about two hundred dollars to get my living room done.&nbsp; The walls I am going to do in dover white.&nbsp; I'm going to get blinds that are an ivory color and these neat looking rods to have a tan sway above the blinds.&nbsp; I'm going with a shade darker for the trim and when I finish this class this is what I hope to work on during my two weeks off before school starts up again.&nbsp; I'm excited because my walls are blue and one is brown.&nbsp; I was experimenting.&nbsp; I can't wait to see the change. I have a light green on my trim and this is a hideous combination.&nbsp; I am going to take before and after pictures and I can't wait. I also need to get the ceiling painted.&nbsp; When I was at school, the girls busted the blind on the one window by playing ball in the house.&nbsp;  Anyway, I can't wait until I get it done.

      I dated my high school sweetheart and we were married ten years.&nbsp; We divorced in 1999.&nbsp; He is now remarried and I remain single.&nbsp; I became depressed and isolated myself from everyone.&nbsp; I stayed home.&nbsp; In January this year, I somehow got started in school and my self esteem has increased.&nbsp; It's been hard because I am a single mom and tire easily because I also have Lupus, an immune disease.&nbsp; At present, this is in remission. I only planned on school and taking care of my kids.&nbsp; I had no interest in finding someone in my life.&nbsp; This didn't happen.&nbsp; I was helping my friend get ready for an aution sale and she had company stop in.&nbsp; He wanted me to meet this guy.&nbsp; I wouldn't agree to the blind date deal but I would meet him if he were to come with.&nbsp; I had a bad experience on a blind date and this turned me from ever going on another one. This guy seems really nice but is not divorced.&nbsp; He had been separated nine months and I think today is actually when the divorce is final.&nbsp; I've been seeing him for about a month now.&nbsp; For the first week he called me everyday and was also over everyday.&nbsp; I found it hard to get my school work done because he would stay until 11:00 p.m. or later and then go home. One time he called and asked about us and I told him the truth.&nbsp; I really have been getting mixed messages and don't have time for anyone in my life right now.&nbsp; I got a bad feeling and within minutes he was over.&nbsp; Thank goodness I was at my friends.&nbsp; He stayed for three and a half hours.&nbsp; He did take the kids to the park but my friend told me not to leave so I didn't. I thought it was over.&nbsp; He called leaving a message to call him back.&nbsp; I didn't.&nbsp; Friday, the last day of speech, my friend rode back to clearbrook with me.&nbsp; She lives in Bemidji but her parents live in clearbrook.&nbsp; She is one who&nbsp;smokes and it was late.&nbsp; There was no place to stop but the Leonard bar and this guy was waiting for me.&nbsp; Before she got out of the car he came out and gave me the dirtiest look.&nbsp; She went in for her&nbsp;cigarettes and he came over.&nbsp; He told me&nbsp;how rude&nbsp;I&nbsp;was on Wednesday.&nbsp; I thought it was rude of him to come over and I let him know it.&nbsp; He told me it would work and of course talked me into going to&nbsp;the Besida Bar and Grill for supper and talk things over.&nbsp; We never did talk much but had prime rib which was delicious. We went to&nbsp;Sportsmans Lodge after&nbsp;and danced.&nbsp; On the way there,&nbsp;he talked of his drunken, soon to be ex-wife.&nbsp; I hear of her everyday and finally told him if I got to listen to one more word i'm going to get mad.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; I let him have it and told him of my divorce. He said,  "See, you do the same thing."&nbsp; Oh, if nothing made me more mad that did and to top it off&nbsp;he told me to get over it.&nbsp; This really pissed me off because I have been divorced five years, joined a support&nbsp;group for divorced, widowed, and separated and felt much better and I am glad to be over mine. There was another incident soon after that&nbsp;I would say was about a week ago.&nbsp; He told me I&nbsp;had problems and worded it just&nbsp;right to piss me off again.&nbsp; I told him to stay out of my life and I didn't need this.&nbsp; Just stay away from me and leave me alone.&nbsp; It didn't work. The waterpump went out on his pick-up and today I am going to try work up my nerve to end it again.&nbsp; I went out saturday night.&nbsp; I am not a drinker but I'm glad I was drinking and by myself that night.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun and stayed at a cabin so I didn't drink and drive.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think I was drinking just to get all the worries off my mind and this doesn't make me proud to drink.&nbsp; I just don't like it but that night something got into me and I drand windsor cokes.&nbsp; I had four.&nbsp; More than enough for me because&nbsp;I am a non-drinker.&nbsp; It hit&nbsp;me hard. This guy just wants to&nbsp;be friends but gives me mixed signals and turns this around on me saying I am doing this to him.&nbsp; I see his good points in how he is a good worker, keeps his house clean and takes care of his kids.&nbsp; His bad point is he wants to see me all the time.&nbsp; Last time, he said I should just put school off.&nbsp;&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;not a&nbsp;chance. Anyway, I how I get this worked out soon before I get sick and my Lupus flares up.&nbsp;

      I chose this topic because I have a sister who is in deep trouble because of meth.&nbsp; This started a while ago when she met this guy selling and dealing meth.&nbsp; This is what got her started. She dated him for two&nbsp;to three years.&nbsp; It seemed longer to me because personally I didn't like him from the start.&nbsp; He started keeping and turning her against family like we were the ones who weren't helping her.&nbsp; He tell her we were no good and she should stay away from us which she did.&nbsp; She paid $8000.00 dollars for a trailer house and within a six month frame period she had borrowed money from the bank and had nothing left to show for herself. She got away from him by moving to Grand Forks and met another guy not much better than the first.&nbsp; How can she keep meeting this men who are no good for her?&nbsp; He smoked marijuana and has been in jail and on probation numerous times.&nbsp; She has an eleven year old daughter from her first and only marriage.&nbsp; With the guy in grand forks she has a daughter and son which are a year apart in age.&nbsp; My niece will be two years old in septemper and my nephew will be one year in september.&nbsp; One was born the 22nd of sept. and the other, the 16th. There has been so much confusion and sadness.&nbsp; I don't know myself how to deal with it all because there is nothing I can do. Last year when my nephew was born, he tested positive for having meth in his system.&nbsp; My sister called me frightened and scared.&nbsp; I went down to Grand Forks where he was in the NICU.&nbsp; There wasn't much I could do.&nbsp; Social Services placed him in Foster Care.&nbsp; That is how it works when they are born in the hospital and family has no say.&nbsp; We did about my niece.&nbsp; My sister in the cities had come up to take her to her home for a while and then my brother had her for a while.&nbsp; My&nbsp;sister went to treatment last year and in December she came to my house.&nbsp; She looked better and felt better than she had in a long time.&nbsp; I have a lot of ambivalance toward my sister and I did try to help.&nbsp;  It took a while but when I started school she had gotten back her kids and stayed with me in January, 2004 for a month.&nbsp; My mom lived four miles from me so I told her with my going to school it was too hard for me.&nbsp; I have a small house and my mom has an extra room so I asked her to go there.&nbsp; She threw a fit and told me I was throwing her to the curb when she needed me most.&nbsp; I know I didn't because she had my mom's place to stay. As I'm writing this, I found out yesterday that she had a bad U.A.&nbsp; I was shocked because she had been doing so well.&nbsp; My other sister who is thirteen months older than I visited her regularly.&nbsp; She had been on house arrest for three months and would of had it taken off yesterday.&nbsp; My brother and Mom went to get my niece because he is taking her so social services doesn't place her in fostercare.&nbsp; My nephew is going to foster care to the same people who had him before.&nbsp; They are the most wonderful people and have been there trying to help my sister and her kids.&nbsp; My niece, who is eleven years old is staying with her aunt because her dad is working construction in the cities.&nbsp; He comes home every week-end to see her.&nbsp; This is the same arrangement that was set up before. When she got into trouble before it was in the paper and of course people talk.&nbsp; My sister puts the blame on me for everyone finding out and this time I don't care.&nbsp; I'm so mad that I want to slap her and hug her at the same time. I feel torn.&nbsp; I feel hurt.&nbsp; I hated that I had to tell my two daughters about this.&nbsp; They both love their aunt dearly and I just don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp; I let my oldest daughter, who is fourteen years old stay there for one week to help out with the kids not realizing the dangerous environment I had placed her in.&nbsp; I wasn't thinking of that.&nbsp; I thought to help keep my sister off of drugs, known as crank, it would help to have her babysit the kids.&nbsp; Now I will not allow her to go there.&nbsp; Only if we visit and then leave.&nbsp; My sister isn't willing to give up on the guy she is with who is still in jail but will be getting out on probation shortly.&nbsp; What a messed up life for her. What I want to do is try to forget about all this and concentrate on my going to school and taking care of my own kids.&nbsp; This is difficult to do because in order to work out problems such as this one, I go to a counselor myself.&nbsp; There is no way I can deal with this on my own.&nbsp; My family gets mad at me because they don't want anyone to know.&nbsp; They are in denial and with it being in the newspaper,&nbsp; I don't know how they figure this isn't going to get out.&nbsp;  I cryed when I heard of this happening all over again.&nbsp; I hear people say that meth is the worse addictive behavior to have and it is hard to get off of and stay away from it.&nbsp; I guess she thinks more of her addiction than she does the life of her own kids.&nbsp;  I don't know what is going to happen but this time I would think she gets jailtime.&nbsp; I don't even want to have anything to do with her anymore.&nbsp; I love and hate her at the same time but she was given a chance and I can't see how she could be so dumb to screw it up again.&nbsp; You'd think she'd of learned from the first time of losing her kids.&nbsp; This time may be permanent placement and to tell you the truth it&nbsp;would be for the best.

      There isn't a whole lot that I know of about tomatoes but I sure do like the cherry tomatoes. My dad starts planting tomatoes indoors in the back bedroom. He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily. He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning, when the sun is shining, he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight. He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants. My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was. I thought it to be quite ugly myself. And that was the name of it. The Ugly Tomato. He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don't taste much different. He plants way too many tomato plants. He had people from all over town in gonvick, minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty. Gonvick is a small town. The population is around three-hundred. My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili. They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes. Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them. My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain. My daughter, Brittany doesn't care for tomatoes much. Bridget, my oldest daughter does though. She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find. She also loves the cherry tomatoes. I'm not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B.L.T.

      Someday, I hope to have a house bigger than what i am living in now and have enough money to do what i want instead of just live paycheck to paycheck.  It gets old.  In this neck of the woods, I wonder how many of us there are.  I think there are only a few people with money in this area and I wish I were one of them.   Someday, I hope to take a trip myself. This won't happen for a while because my youngest is three years old and i want to enjoy myself with hopefully someone special in my life by that time. Someday I hope to go to Hawaii. Someday could go on forever but I hope someday I will also win the lottery or go to the black hills.  That may be a goal i could start now. Someday, I would like to go on an airplane or the amtrak to montana where my niece lives. Someday, I hope they find a cure for cancer and other illnesses.  Sooner than later. Someday.

      I still see myself jumping around a bit but i find myself putting more thought into what i am writing about and i see it improving a little bit at a time.  I may not write the best but i do the best i can.  I enjoy reading the storys' and trying to write on the subject afterwards.  It's fun to see what i come up with and i think by the end of class i will be doing a lot better.  I am having fun and i do think it also is helping improve my own self-esteem.  I feel more confident than i did in the beginning.

           I found this a tough subject.  To find something meaningless.  When mentioning the paper clip in class i thought that it helps hold papers together so that isn't meaningless to me.  Then I thought of tape but realized that helps with wrapping presents so the thing i find meaningless is butter or margarine.  I just don't see the difference.  I can take it or leave.  All i ever had was margarine and I was fine with that.  My sister-in-law grew up on butter but my brother says the same thing i do.  Margarine is cheaper and to my brother and i, there really isn't much difference to us.  Reminds me of when i make chocolate chip cookies.  I use two sticks of margarine and the thought never occurred to me to use butter.  When i make chocolate chips bars, i use margarine.  In fact, i only buy butter when it is cheap enough.  It has to be on sale for me.  I don't know what the point of this meaningless subject is and i can't find an end.  The only time I have used butter is if i have bought it on sale and use when i make mashed potatoes but it makes no difference to me because it tastes the same to me even if i use margarine and i don't even think my sister-in-law can tell the difference then.  Especially, if gravy is poured over the top of the mashed potatoes when eating them.  How would anyone know which one i used, butter or margarine.  I guess the point I see myself coming to is "Buy margarine! It's Cheaper!

           I think we have all improved in this class with our writing.  At first, I think it was hard for all of us and this class, to me, requires more of a thinking process so I have seen all of us improve on that.      I like that we share our opinions because  it is amazing to me of how we can read the same essay and still see things different.  I find the sharing helps me to see another angle or focus that i hadn't before.      I like this class but i feel pressed for time.  I'm glad I have only this one left for the summer.

           I enjoyed going to the park a lot.  It was my place of escape for some peace and quiet and I enjoyed the culvert and the river.  I remember there was a tree that had fallen across that river and I would walk and sit there for a long time.  I feel like there was a spot just for me because on that tree that fell across that river, it had another part of a tree branching upward.  This is what I considered to be my private spot and this tree had a built in chair for me, so it seemed.  That is how I pictured it.  I went there everyday during the summer.  The grass was so green.  There were also outhouses so I wouldn't need to go home to use the bathroom.  There were trees with names carved into them.  One had the shape of a heart with someones initials abbreviated inside that heart.  There were picnic tables.  Those also had abbreviations or initials in them as well.  We would have our last day of Sunday School at this park in Gonvick, Minnesota.  We would have teachers bring bars or we would pack a lunch, if we liked.  We played games and I remember someone falling into the river.  I don't remember exactly who it was but he/she was completely drenched from his head to his/her toes.        I went there to the park for Sunday School and Vacation Bible School Settings.  Sometimes as the child and sometimes as the Teacher.  I think I taught Sunday School for three years and I also helped with Vacation Bible School for two years.  We played games and ate lots of food.     I think this place I found to be safe for me in my life and I also have a lot of enjoyable memories.  I remember going there also with my brother and sister.  We would be running through the culvert because, at times, there wasn't much water so we would start running and swaying and moving from side to side so we wouldn't get wet by the water.  We would just keep having fun going back and forth from one end of the culvert to the other.  We weren't the only ones who did this because I remember the graffiti inside that culvert.       My brother, Dennis, would go fishing there during the summer and we'd tag along, my sister, Jane and I.  I spent a great deal of summer with a friend.  Her name was Sherry. We would also go there a lot and sometimes we would fall in.  I remember one time the water was going pretty rapidly and I didn't think nothing of it at the time but we could have drowned.  Boy, I don't know if my Mom knows about that to this day.      I think the existance for this essay is that I found this place comfortable and convenient for me.  I would go down there and sometimes walk along the river to see where it led to.  I was gone for a long time.  It took me about two hours just to walk the one way of the river because I would find or spot some interesting things.  I thought of having a place where I would build a fort but that never happened.  I only imagined it.      It's sad to say, but I think this was a hiding spot for me, away from my dad when he was drinking.  I'd get tired of the arguing and fighting so this is where I would always go for hours.  I also believe Sunday School is another Safe Haven place I found to be and I enjoyed the songs.  Sometimes, I would sit on that tree and remember a song from church and sing.  One of those songs, that I remember, is: "What a Friend we Have in Jesus."  I also feel this was something I'd like to say was my thinking grounds.  I found peace and serenity in these surroundings.

      I think I have more than one imperfection in my family but one thing while growing up is I remember my Dad being gone a lot and found out that he is an Alcoholic.  I grew up with five brothers and three sisters and some are alcoholics and some are not.  I may not have turned into an alcoholic but I do remember how tough it was for all of us.  There were a lot of sleepless nights and I remember being very tired for school some days because my dad would come home drunk and wake us all up and finally he'd either pass out or start eating something and then go to bed.  I had a hard time accepting and not understanding much about alcoholism until I went too some Al-Anon meetings and it made me understand to detach from the alcohol, and not the alcoholic.  Words just can't describe how many bottles of whiskey I dumped down the drain and my brothers and sisters did the same thing.  That wasn't the end of it though.  Something worse had to happen before my dad went to seek treatment and that was the part of molesting my niece.  This I have only been able to comprehend in the last couple years because I was a Senior when this happened.  When you think things can't get any worse than the drinking, it can.  Thank goodness it was fondling and no intercourse.  That sounds bad but I'm thankful for that part of it not getting any further than it already had.  My Dad is now a recovering alcoholic but still I find it hard to me to this day to see him and not picture what has been done.  I know it wasn't me and nothing did happen to me.  As for the rest of my family members, I can not say for sure.  It is another sick disease.  My dad is now eighty-three years old and I'm not sure why I am writing of this now but I still love my Dad and Mom even though what has happened is wrong.  I remember my niece saying at the time that she didn't want to get grandpa in any trouble but I guess this is what it took for the drinking to stop.  He had a hard time because he was away in treatment for three and a half years and I wrote him back a letter when I received one from him.  It still really hurts when something like this happens and I think I speak for my dad, my family and myself when I say we still always will suffer great emotional pain from this.  I feel this imperfection helped my dad to seek the help he needed.  The one thing I hate about all of this is why didn't he get help before it had come to that?  I guess I'll never know.  This was very hard for me to write about because in some ways I feel ashamed to be a part in this as family.  All I know is, I never left my girls alone with my Dad even though I love him.  He may have this imperfection and his faults but he has taught me a lot also and in the last couple years, I've actually been able to talk and enjoy being around my dad where as before I would feel somewhat uncomfortable but not anymore.

      Bonnie Erlandson  College Writing I  July 3, 2004  In the story, ONE HOUR, the author catches my attention by starting out the day being so beautiful and then as I read further on I see it changing into something else.  That they are on their way to the hospital to pay their last respects to their wonderful father and grandfather.  This catches me off guard for a moment until I continue to read further on.  I think it's because of the way it just starts out being the nice day and I find it hard to believe when someone you know is sick but with his suffering the peace finally comes to an end for his family and himself when he passes away, knowing his loved ones were there, by his side, to comfort him.  I think the author, while talking about his grandfather and what I also see, is the sense of humor being used, the way is grandfather always smiled and never letting his family know his pain, the talking of childhood memories brings me back to the little time I spent with my grandfather because he passed away when I was young. His birthday was March 10th and what a coincidence, so is mine.  I remember both my grandma and grandpa often, especially while reading this story, ONE HOUR.  This story takes me back to the day my Grandpa passed away and my dad wouldn't let me go to the funeral.  I remember him chewing snooze and spitting it into a folgers coffee can, holding me on his lap and the lump he had on the one side of his face by his chin because it was obvious for anyone to see.  I also remember my grandmother being put in the home shortly after my grandpa died.  It wasn't long before she passed away and I remember getting to go to her funeral and I'll never forget how beautiful she looked.  I can still picture her to this day and she looked like an angel and that is exactly how I remember her.  She was a very caring person.  This is the grandparents on my dad's side and I wasn't born yet when my mom's parents passed away so I only go by storys that I hear from my mom or her sister or brother.  Mostly, I just remember my Dad's parents though.  It doesn't seem like the memories ever fade.  Only that the time gets longer that they've been gone.  I loved them both very much.

      I make great homemade apple pies. This is what I am told by my family anyway and it does feel really good to do something I enjoy and this makes me feel wonderful and helps me forget all my worries because I get into making my own homemade crust and peeling the applies and making a little apple out of the crust to put on top when I'm ready to pop them in the oven and the smell is just peachy. The aroma that fills the air just gives the good feeling that I've accomplished something. When they are done, the apple pies disappear in a hurry.  I usually use six to seven red delicious apples in each pie and I always make at least two.  They are also my Dad's favorite.  His Birthday is May 31st and I had made apple pies the day before his birthday.  That morning he had told my mom that he wanted apple pie instead of cake for his birthday.  His wish came true when I came walking in the door with an apple pie in my hand.  I also remember that for thanksgiving, my one brother had to stay home because his kids had the chickenpox so I brought him over apple pie.  I stayed only long enough to tell him Happy Thanksgiving and also long enough for him to tell me thank you and it is the closest to Grandma's pies that will ever be that good.  Now everyone I think expects Apple Pie around the Holidays and my dad on his Birthday.

      I have a dream that one day I will either own my own "PicturePerfect" Studio where I will get all the business I can handle, if not more.  I love to take photos or snapshots of anything and everything.  Sometimes, I wonder how I will ever get all the pictures organized that I already have.    I did start a Creative Memories class but shortly  after beginning that I moved back to my hometown and now I haven't had time to get around to it because creating a special kind of photo is very time-consuming.  I also have a three year old, Riley, who would like to just tear into all my stickers and markers and different jagged scissors I use when working with my pictures so I need to wait until his Dad takes him. By then I'm too tired and  I take time to relax and watch a movie instead. I also have two girls that also keep me very busy.

      What a powerful message!  This is the first time I've read this and was moved by the flowing of this essay.  Not only as a reality, but as a piece of literature.  It impressed me that he chose to connect with people by using familiar terms.  I'm also equally impressed that he balanced the idea of working towards this freedom with caution regarding the path that is taken to reach that freedom.  Some groups will use any means to achieve their goal, which at times defeats the purpose and makes them like those they oppose.

      I found it refreshing that the author states to "give up worrying about image" when writing a familiar essay.  This is something that has plagued me.  It's also nice to hear someone describe what I feel like when I finally do settle down to write the "concentrated mindlessness" that precursors a flow of words.

       I found this essay to be very intersting in a weird way. There was no doubt in my mind how much this child wanted to learn to play pool. I liked how the author told a story that at first seemed inconsequential but then showed how it shaped his entire life. The author also made a point as to how that experience effected him socially. ps this was really done on july 2nd

      " I want to plant them in my world and tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healty and strong. I want them to thrive. For anyone that has ever worked around children this is often the main goal. I know that it has been my goal as a future educator.   My goal is to see the children thrive. But I also want to protect them for the harsh reality that we now live in. I don't belive that at the age of five or even six they should have to understand what an attack on U.S. soil is, abduction, or murder is. Their main concerns should be learning, and interacting with kids their own age. But the reality is in this day and age that is something that they learn. I have worked with many kids through my work study program in high school and I have noticed the importance of how a kid needs to be a kid. A child that is forced to grow up to fast is not healthy for any one exspecially the child. As teachers we should help children to be kids.   They only time that they should be a grown-up is when they are playing dress up and acting like one. Children that have play grown -up to soon is devistating and can even cause problems later in life. When they are actual grown-ups they don't know what the meaning of fun is. All they do is work. Their life turns into work. Trust me that was me a few years ago. I never went out with friends or even to school funtions. I thought to my self why bother. No one at school has the same goals in life as I did. At this time I was also fighting a battle with depression. That had been going on for a while. Then in eight grade I snaped I just could not take it any more.  After spending 48 hours in lock down I took a good long look at my life and the direction that it was headed in and made many changes in my life. Like instead of going out I just wanted time to my self. I had friends but now it seemed that they did not share the same goals as I did. That was until I moved to Bagley and met my two best friends Tarah and Leah they showed me that I should not let my depression get the best of me. They have been through everything with me and they are there when I need someone just to complain to. Just as I am there for them.  Then in 11th grade I started to go up to the elementary school and worked with the kindergardeners on a daily basis this helped me face many of the problems that I was facing because I saw them sruggling and it made me feel better because I could help my self over come my fear by helping them with their's. Weather it be learning to read and write to the simplist task of tieing a shoe. It both of us happy when I helped them learn a skill that they are going to use in everyday day life. So no matter who you are you the simplist way that you can help a child thrive is by just being their to help them if they have a problem.

      While reading "News of The Wild" by Scott Russell Sanders I thought of my uncle Don Adamson and the times we spent together building his cabin in northern Minnesota. Sanders wrote "When America was all wilderness except for occasional villages and orchards and clear fields, a journey of any distance was a serious undertaking." This reminded me of my uncle because we too would take journeys into the wilderness that were sometimes difficult.  I helped my uncle build his cabin far in the deep woods of Minnesota. What made it so difficult is that there are no roads that would allow a standard size vehicle to enter, everything was either brought in by hand or with the use of a four wheeler. During our jouney into the woods, I can recall a feeling of being one with the land. Much of the wood that we used to build this cabin came directly from the forest we cleared in order to make room for the cabin. We spent many back breaking days working and on occasion we would visit the closest town just to take a well needed shower and have a "home" cooked meal. I felt as if I was a pioneer back in the old days.  Sanders essay also reminded me of how our(Caucasian) culture differs is comparison to the Native American culture. He states "We will carry a pouch of tobacco to placate the old water monsters, along with a water-treatment kit to placate the new ones, those poisons and parasites we two-leggeds have flushed into the remotest rivers and lakes." This made me think of how the Native American culture seems to be more in tune with their surroundings. Many Native Americans have beliefs that differ from what society has deemed "the norm". They seem to nurture the land, not taking anything of value from it, leaving it as they found it after they have been there. Whereas the (Caucasian) culture seems to only look at something for their benefit without concern for what could have been, a lasting beauty.

      I have many fond memories of our past Christmas’ as the boys were growing up.  The first Christmas we celebrated after leaving the commune was the first we celebrated as a family.  Asa (the oldest) was about four years old, Nathanael (the second) was two and Matthew (the third) was a little over one year old.  My memories of that first Christmas are vague, we didn’t have a tree or other decorations to make our rented trailer festive.  The following year we were renting a house in the country.  Our marvelous landlord told us we could cut down a Christmas tree anywhere on the 200 acres he owned.  This became a tradition.  Each year Duane and I would bundle up the boys and trek on into the woods in search of a Christmas tree.  The snow wasn’t very deep, but we still needed to help the boys through the deeper places because their tiny legs were short.  To them it seemed as if we’d been walking for hours, but we’d only gone into the woods a couple hundred feet.  That first year we decided to cut down a Balsam pine tree.  We forgot to measure the height we needed so we “eyeballed” it.  The boys were so excited as we dragged the tree back to the house.  They were very tired when we finally got home, but excitement kept them from complaining.  Kicking off their boots, hats, mittens and coats, they waited to see what we would do next.  We still didn’t have many decorations.  A friend had given me some that her mother made in a craft class out of beads and colored pipe cleaners.  Asa made one or two in kindergarten that year too.  I popped lots of popcorn, filling a brown grocery bag with it so we could make a garland.  I remember seeing a popcorn garland in some old movie.  We also picked up some fresh cranberries from the store to put on the garland as well.   Not being sure how to make it, each day I would sit with the boys as they watched a children’s program on TV and string popcorn and cranberries.  Ten popcorn then one cranberry, repeating as many times as needed.  I used a sewing needle and regular sewing thread that was doubled.  When I would run out of thread I simply tied on more.  I started the garland a few days before we got the tree and finished it after I tried it out to see if I needed more.  I actually had too much of the garland and had to cut some off.  After getting the tree up to the house, we realized that it was too tall.  It’s amazing how a tree can look a certain size in the great outdoors and then be a different size when you try to bring it into the house.

      Memories of my neighbors dog came to me after reading "She couldn't bear to see a creature in agony like that." in Annie Dillard's "The Deer At Providencia" It brought back memories of Chelsey, a black labrador retriever that was continually neglected. She was cooped up in a twelve by four foot kennel without ever having the opportunity to be let out to get some well needed exercise. I always felt bad playing with my dog Skippy out in the yard with Chelsey looking on, knowing that she could not come out and have some fun and exercise with us.  I asked on many occasions if I could let her out, or take her for a walk, but her owners wouldn't let me. Those people didn't deserve to have such a beautiful animal. I remember how she would look at me, her big brown eyes gazing for some attention, her ears perked up and head cocked to one side, as if to say, please save me. When I would go to visit with her I would always bring a little something special, a juicy bone, or some leftovers from dinner. I didn't care about her getting fat. She had to enjoy something in life.  That winter I let my dog outside, I could hear Skippy barking from over at Chelsey's kennel. I went to investigate, and found Chelsey breathing very heavily, she had about two inches of snow covering her and she couldn't get up. I picked her up, carried her across the yard trying to go as quickly as possible without making her anymore uncomfortable, I then placed her in my pickup and drove her to the veterinary clinic. I had the doctor look at her, he said that her lungs had filled with fluid due to the lack of shelter in the cold. She was suffering from sever pneumonia.  I notified my neighbors about bringing Chelsey to the veterinarian and about her condition. They thanked me in not so much emotion and went to visit her. I returned to the veterinarians office and checked on Chelsey again before the owners got there, she had not improved. I said my goodbyes, nowing full well that this would be the end of her misery. She was put to sleep.

      Memories of my grandmother's house and the four of us grandchildren playing for hours there, was brought back when reading "Time Keeps On Slipping" by Eric Ostrowski.  When he was young he talked of something he was given by his grandmother at the age of five after finding it "on one of my expeditions in one of her many cupboards."  My three brothers; Ricky, Kenny, Stevie, as they were called then, and I would explore my grandparent’s house and grounds for hours.  There was always something new to discover, some new make believe game to play and enough dirt to cover us from head to toe.  My Aunt Barbara, mother's only sibling, rented a room from my grandparents.  She never married.  We were not allowed to go into her bedroom and I don't believe I ever saw what it looked like.  Years later when my grandparents purchased a different house, she moved out and lived on her own until her early death.

      Within the essay, “In The Garden”, written by Deb Sullivan, there was a statement that I feel has great significance in my life. “I realize that I want to do for Jake and Ben as I do for the plants in my garden. I want to plant them in my world tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life.” It would be so much easier as a parent to be able to protect our children from anything that hurts or disappoints them. If we could only create a perfect little world for our children filled with love, happiness, success and good fortune. &nbsp;  As a parent of a child with “special needs”, I have found this statement to be true so many times. I have had to stand back and watch my son be disappointed, rejected and taken advantage of. I have watched him try so hard to be just like the other kids but never quite succeed. I have watched him fill out job applications with miss-spelled words and almost impossible to read handwriting, because he wanted to do it all by himself. I have watched his disappointment when the phone did not ring for an interview after all the time spent filling out those applications with the miss-spelled words and the messy handwriting. I have watched him stand in the doorway of the dugout cheering on his baseball team because the coaches would not put him in the game because all they were thinking about was winning. I have listened to the excuses he made for them saying, “It’s okay. There just wasn’t enough time for me to get in the game mom.”   &nbsp;One day I went to pick my son up at school for a doctor’s appointment, he came out of school with different clothes on than he had left the house with. When I asked him what  happened, he informed me that when he got back to his gym locker, his clothes were gone. He had to get dirty clothes out of the lost and found to replace the ones that had been stolen from him. I asked him how that could have happened if he had locked his locker. He said, “I couldn’t get the lock to work so I laid it on top of the locker where it would be safe. I didn’t want the guys to have to wait for me.” He knew I was upset about his missing clothes. He tried to comfort me by saying, “It’s okay mom, someone else must have needed my clothes.” He was so forgiving. Somehow he always finds the positive side of any situation.  As parents, it is our nature to want to protect our children from hurt and disappointment. However by allowing them to experience the hurt and disappointment, it helps them learn to be better people. Our son is compassionate, forgiving and full of never-ending love. He is not judgmental or prejudice. He accepts people for what they are. He survived the harsh elements of life.&nbsp;

      Tracy Olson  College Writing 1  Julie Lundblad  July 28, 2004  Building Fences  “I want to build a fence around them and protect them from harsh elements of life. I want them to thrive.” I think we all want that for our children and for other children as well. I agree with Deb Sullivan essay In the Garden we want to help those children that would like to have someone to believe in them and listen to what they have to say. I want to protect my children from the harshness that they will have to deal with when they get older and meet my ex-husband which is their dad. He has so much hate for me that he can’t see how bad he’s harming the children when he refuses to see them. He believes that the children will be happy to see him with open arms.  &nbsp;After my parents divorce my father also thought that when my brother and I got older we would welcome him open arms. However, I haven’t seen or talked to my dad in three years. I want to give my children the security they need to have a healthy relationship with their partner and their children one day.  There are my children’s friends that have their father’s in their lives and the kid’s are lonely even though their father’s are there. I get a lot of my children’s friends over and the first thing they say to my husband and I is why can’t my parents be just like you guys. These parents sometime forget how they too were once kids and sometimes we get to busy being adults and not thinking about our children, so that they can feel safe and thrive. In a sense we do build that fence, but not the way the children want us to just want us to listen.  We all can build a fence around anything but we need compassion behind it and we need to let them breath fresh air, if not when they break down that fence look out. My niece’s parents have build fences so high for her that it turned out to be more harmful, she can’t wait until she’s 18 years old and she has told her parents that she is moving out because they have build fences to protect her and they were too high. My niece can’t do the same things as most kids. She’s 15 years old and she can not take a walk around her block because her parents think that someone might kidnap her, however my son who is 13 years old walk home from the middle school dance and home is by the mall. She is also not allowed to walk to the skating rink from my house.  I have a teenager that we had in our home for the past 3 months that had to adjust being in our home that has structure. &nbsp;Before, his mom really didn’t care where he was just as long as he was home at night. He chose to live with us because we have showed our kids we care. The relative he was staying with drank a lot, and he didn’t like that live style there. I hope that we have given him something to carry out in his life when he leaves next Monday, hopefully he will thrive in life and know that someone does care.

      “One prisoner had been brought out of his cell.” This statement came from A Hanging. This statement ties into my essay in the end of how I am the prisoner that gets out of his cell.  I am a prisoner. I am the soul person responsible for this miserable crime. My crime is leading a life that I can’t seem to break out of. It is a life of being alone, sad and with drawn from the world of a normal person. This life is a cell; I live in it and hide behind it. My cell is the cell of not a normal person would want. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My mind stirs thoughts of being normal. My face has scares from the beatings I took as a child. My dad would get mad when he was drunk and he would beat me til I bleed. The day I became a prisoner and was put in this cell is when I killed my father. My father came home drunk that day and was filled with anger and he went right for me, but this time I took one of his guns and shot him several times til he fell to the floor.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This day I became a prisoner, my miserable crime of killing my father wasn’t a crime but a defense of not getting beat another time. My cell is ten by ten and has a toilet and a bunk bed in it. I sit in my cell day after day and think of that day I became a prisoner. I ponder how I can break out of my cell and think how nice it would be to lead a normal life. But, while I sit in my cell I hide behind these walls and I feel alone, not just not having another inmate in my cell but feeling alone from not being able to experience a normal life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ten years have went by and the warden came to my cell and told me I was free for my case was reopened and I was free because I killed my father out of defense. My cell is just a cell now and I am free to be normal now. It is great to be free but I still feel alone because I am scared for life.

      There is a part in Judith Viorsts' essay, "WHAT ME? SHOWING OFF?" that caught my eye.&nbsp; This part is "showoffs always run the risk of being thought immodest, of being harshly viewed as...well...showoffs.  This brought me back to high school where a classmate of mine was the one showing off.&nbsp; This was especially true in volleyball and it didn't help that the coach&nbsp;showed favortism toward her.&nbsp; This gave her more room to show off with spiking the volleyball.  She was good at everything.&nbsp; She had good grades, voted for as homecoming queen, well-liked and popular, also a showoff.&nbsp; She was a big time showoff and everyone in our class knew it.&nbsp; There was no competing with her.&nbsp; She was known to many as a class pet to most of the teachers.  Now older, I see her showing off is not as bothersome&nbsp;to me as it&nbsp;used to be in high school.&nbsp; I think being older has changed my perspective as she&nbsp;just has more money and is spoiled.&nbsp;   The old version I find her being the teacher's pet in almost every class.&nbsp; The new version is I still find her snobbish, at times.&nbsp; I find her&nbsp;to now be active&nbsp;in enjoying life and helping out society in a way that makes her feel a part of good in herself such as painting smiley faces on kids at the carnivals or Sunday school teacher and helping out with vacation bible school.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;think we all find our way of showing off from time to time, sometimes in a good&nbsp;way and sometimes not in a good way.&nbsp; Most of us, I think, just want someone to appreciate us for who we are.&nbsp; Some of us are more modest in our showing off and some of us seem to flaunt showing&nbsp;off more than others.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to find myself in the modest part where my classmate is the one to flaunt herself.

      Amanda Pickerell    July 28, 2004 Julie Lundblad Springboard essay 1                                                 Far From Perfect You used to see them every day. They used to be the people that everyone admired. Their son was the captain of the football team and their daughter was the cheerleading captain. Dad worked from 9 to 5 Monday through Friday, and Mom made Turkey for dinner and Apple Pie for desert. “The Perfect Family”, the family that everyone wanted to be in.           We often see other people’s families in very different eye’s than we see our own. We see the Mom that makes fresh baked cookies every week. We see milk that is delivered to their door step. We see the kids with 4.0 grade point averages. We may even see the Dad coming home from work to a hot meal and a back rub by his ever devoted wife. Maybe our best friend is the Cheerleading Captain. Maybe we work with the Dad. Whatever part we have in one of the family member’s lives we still see the “Roses that grow by the door step.”           But there are things that we dont see. Like when the daughter ends up pregnant at 16 or when the son is heavy into drugs or alchohol abuse. We can't see the mom being abused by her husband or the dad being laid off of work. Althought this is a worst case scenario, it is a good example of the things that we dont see because we dont want to see. also the other people dont want to have us see the imperfections in their perfect lives. They can sweep it under the carpet. As do all families. We all have things to hide. THe question here is, do you hide your problems and never solve them or do you display it for all to see.           Alice Hoffman’s Essay “The Perfect Family” tells us what it was like fifty years ago, and how every family was portrayed as. “When I was growing up in the 50’s there was only one sort of family, the one we watched on television every day. Right  in front of us, in black and white, was everything we needed to know about family  values: the neat patch of lawn, the apple tree, the mother who never once raised her voice, the three lovely children: a Princess, a Kitten, a Bud and, always, the father who knew best.” She knew then that all of the families were not perfect. However that is how all people saw other families. WHen her parents got a divorce, their problems were not as easily hidden. She shares that “I did not meet another child of divorced parents until 10 years later when I went off the college.”           It is said now that one in two marriages will end in either divorce or a legal separation. Our world is no longer seemingly perfect. We have mothers that have children out of wedlock and fathers that are alcoholics. Every day we see stories of children that do not have enough food for them to eat. We also see violence on TV, newspapers, radio, and most recently the internet. A person can find recipes for homemade bombs and other such violent weapons. Just three years ago we saw Terrorists fly loaded planes full of innocent people into the World trade Center.          The interesting thing about all of these problems that we see now is that it was the same way then as it is now. There were fathers that cheated on their wives and Children starved every day. We were fighting wars then and we were shown violence then too. What made the difference then? Why did we not see all of the same problems then. IT might be because it was not "acceptable" then. It was seen as different or abnormal. when did it become a normal occurance for families to break apart and destroy any children in that family? The moest important question here is : Why do we see all of our problems now, and why couldnt we see them fifty years ago?           THE actual truth of the matter is that we had the same problems. we saw the same things. It was not acceptable then. Even though times have changed and our standards have for some reason gone down, we also have some things that have changed for the  good. Anyone that wants to can go to college and get a degree. WHites and blacks can eat in the same restureaunt, and people can fall in love an not have to worry if they are in the same social class. Instead of dwelling on the negitive things, why dont we stop and think about all of the things that we take for granted. Just take the time to stop and smell the roses.

We will glance by and pretend that we didn’t see them. They make us uncomfortable. They look at us, unashamed, and yet we will not look back. We are ashamed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the homeless people that we see going around street corners and sitting on the cracked sidewalks. They are the people that we look at and even look through. They are the bums, the refuse of our society, the blemishes on our perfect little communities. We see them as the embodiment of disgrace, human life at its lowest form. We don’t question why they are here; we’re sure that it was by some unlawful act of laziness that they find themselves in such a position.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though in our minds we are sure of this, we are ashamed. We are ashamed to be driving by in our cars, holding our Styrofoam container of leftovers from the restaurant we just left. We are unsettled by their presence, they make us feel guilty. We get angry at them. We worked hard for what we have and we deserve it. How dare these faces, these unfamiliar faces, make us feel guilty. The nerve of these people. After all, they’re living the way they are because of their mistakes, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We release our anger and self assurance and continue to drive by, to walk by. We won’t meet their gaze, it makes us uncomfortable. We begin to wonder how cold it will get tonight. We wonder if they have people to talk with or if they will try to sleep in silence. Will they find a crevice of some rare trod street to curl up in? Or has dignity left so long ago that they feel no need to hide themselves. Will they choose the more sheltered area under the storefront awning though it is more exposed to the critical eye of the public? We wonder this as we turn the radio up in our luxury vehicles.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise distracts you, distracts you from feeling that dangerous feeling that you’ve tried to fight off every time you drive in this part of town. But this time the music doesn’t soothe, it makes you think. Thinking can be very dangerous.  You try to find another avenue of thought to stroll down, but those eyes haunt you. You made the mistake; you looked into that person’s eyes as you were driving by. You knew better than to do that, but you did it anyway. Now those eyes stare at you, though they don’t see you anymore.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You turn off the radio. It isn’t distracting anymore, at least not in the way you want it to be. Now it is almost taunting you, mocking your conscience. It points its nonexistent finger at you. It knows why you turned it on and that exposure makes you nervous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see these people. I don’t see them often, but their plight I can feel. I wonder if they know people drive by them and feel sorry for them. Would they appreciate the thought? Would they shudder to know that people look down on them as unfortunate, the fateful chosen ones of Life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to put myself in their shoes, but it is impossible. I want to know, but I am scared to know. Could I handle the truth? Could I be so open to what they could share with me that I would truly be able to comprehend? I don’t think so. I cannot look out at the world from their perspective. I cannot know what it is like to sleep on cement slabs with the rain trailing down me and know that I have no place to go to dry off. I cannot look out at the world through their eyes. Oh, those eyes. They follow me. Oh please, look anywhere but here.

      &nbsp; I Want a Husband. I am free and miserable trying to find my soul mate and when I find a husband he will do everything or at least make his wife happy. As I wash clothes one day it appeared in my mind of my good friend who got married a couple years ago and now him and his wife are expecting there first child. Why does this strike me so well is because I see things that I want in a husband. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I want a husband who will support me with money. I want a husband that understands when I say things should be split 50/50. I want a husband that will cook for me when I am not up to it, he will massage my feet when I come home after a hard days work. I want a husband who will make sure the dishes are done when I have no time to do them and he will do this for me without me asking. I want a husband that will clean up after himself, this is hard to find but all men are trainable. I want a husband that does not need to be told to put the toilet seat down. I want a husband that will make time for me without making excuses because he is to busy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I want a husband that will take care of my children when I need a break from life. I want a husband that with take care of my physical needs. I want a husband that will not complain when he feels that he is doing more then me. I want a husband that will take care of me when I am ill, he will bring me to my doctor’s appointments and he will miss work if I want him to be home to take care of my ailing body. I want a husband that will not be jealous of my male friends. I want a husband who will listen to my problems and try to help me solve them without getting frustrated. I want a husband that will make sure there is food on the table, and to make sure the children are fed and in bed on time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I want a husband that will take care of the arrangements when we go out on the town. I want a husband who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a husband that will make love to me passionately and eagerly and &nbsp;be worried about my needs and not his. And, of course I want a husband that will understand and not pout when I am not in the mood for him. I want a husband that will just give me the love and support he knows he wants in return.   Who woundn't&nbsp;want a husband who can give her all these things?

      Jennifer Parkhurst Springboard 1 Julie Lundblad July 28, 2004 “His pain is over.” I read One Hour by Kim Dennig. It was a touching story of losing a family member. I like the emotion and the love he had for his grandfather. Ever since I was very young I’ve had an interest in nursing.&nbsp; I remember when my grandpa passed away when I was eight years old.&nbsp; I thought to myself that if I was a nurse maybe I could have helped him.&nbsp; At the young age of eight, I realized death is forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was twenty I began working as a nurse’s aid.&nbsp; I worked at Havenwood Care Center in Bemidji.&nbsp; I worked at the nursing home for two and half years.&nbsp; As a nurses aid I helped the elderly residents with their activities of daily living.&nbsp; Many of the residents come to the nursing home.&nbsp; They come to live out the rest of their lives in nursing homes.&nbsp; It was difficult because they could no longer take care of themselves at home.&nbsp; Their skin was fragile, and sensitive. Some residents had dementia and Alzheimer patients.&nbsp; I enjoyed visiting them at supper time and I would talk to the residents that could not speak although the other staff would not.&nbsp; I just hope someone would talk to me if I could not speak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was frequently asked to stay over.&nbsp; Although, exhausted from working the evening shift, I would stay and help. First, rounds at one a.m. involved a lot of lifting and turning patients.&nbsp; We would answer lights and take turns taking residents to the restroom.&nbsp; Rounds went by fast and it kept me from being sleepy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three a.m. it was time to round again. Half way though rounds I checked the lady in the second bed, and I found something shocking.&nbsp; I turned on the light and noticed the woman’s skin was yellow and cold.&nbsp; Her eyes were open, and her leg was hanging over the bed as if she was trying to get up. I said her name but she did not answer me.&nbsp; Just two hours ago I had spoken to this lady and she said, “So is it time to get up.”&nbsp; Wow, this was the first person I had actually found dead.&nbsp; I felt very confused and I felt like this wasn’t real.&nbsp; I had no idea this would have such an emotional impact on me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found it was hard to deal with at first, I couldn’t forget how scary she looked lying in bed starring.&nbsp; I didn’t know if I would be able to continue to work in this field but as they say time heals all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I am working at Cass lake Public Health Services hospital. Although people die there too, I am gaining experience in a variety of areas.&nbsp; Now I have three children and I cherish each day that I am able to play with, feed, and provide for, there for them because someday I too will be old.

      The essay by Stanton L. Wormley, Jr., had a lot of thought to it. He was tought to not fight back. But a person can only take so much before they decided to change there feelings. I like it his ideas were great.

      The essay I read by Judy Brady, was very interesting. I thought the lady wanting a wife. But it showed the different views of a mother/wife. I believe she is right that women do alot of things in a family setting. Maybe I should have my boyfriend read this essay.

      I was just asking a girlfriend today (a few years younger than I) what she thought we'd be like as little old ladies.&nbsp; Reading this story is like other's I've read and it make me cringe to think that someday I may need this type of attention.&nbsp; I am glad that my mother, because of alzheimer's, didn't know where she was when we put her in a home.&nbsp; I'm also thankful that I never had to do that with my father.&nbsp; This story definately makes me think of my future and how I would like it to be shaped and what I will do about that while I can.

       What a novel idea!&nbsp; Being both wife and mother I found great pleasure in reading this essay by Judy Brady.&nbsp; I love her idea, the way she put it across.&nbsp; Even now with my children grown and on their own, I'm still a wife and student.&nbsp; It would be nice as she said, "I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies."&nbsp; Among other parts of her idea, this will all too soon be a reality as I hit school full time next semester.

      We try to raise our kids to just walk away. Stanton was raised that way and sometimes when we have had a enough we fight back. I think anyone would feel good about fighting back when they had no choice.&nbsp;However that good&nbsp;feeling is temporary.   We are taught not to fight back, yet there is a certain satisfaction in retaliating. Then our hearts take over and we know hurting someone only hurts us.&nbsp;

      At first, I was wondering why would a woman want a wife. Then, when I read this essay I thought this was the way I felt. I had to read it to my husband you would think he would say something, NO!! He didn't, &nbsp;you would think that would of made him say hey I'm sorry that you would need a wife. I will start helping out, but No!!   A lot&nbsp;of women can sympathize with Judy some women have husbands that seem to take us for granted and don't understand what we really go though. We work harder then we do in the workforce, we sometimes work or even go to school and they still expect us to do everything. I think we should have this put into a poster to have hanging where our men can see it so they can be reminded how much we do for them.

      This essay made me aware of what is going on in the inside of Anna Mae.&nbsp; I think that we overlook and are not sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of the aged.&nbsp; We can see by the outside that there is graying, wrinkling, aging, sagging, crippling, and decaying and assume subconsciously that that defines the person as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; When in fact that that is not always the case, there may be the mind of a 30 year old in the body of a 84 year old.&nbsp;   This essay will relate to my reality in the way that I will be more sensitive and understanding of the elderly in my personal and professional life.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Blogging of “I Want a Wife”  This essay is a realistic look at the life of a wife.&nbsp; When I had first read this essay it seemed to me that there was a tone of what is labeled as “man bashing”.&nbsp; In reading it a second and third time, the tone changed.&nbsp; When she says, “As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening…” it sounds as if it is a matter of fact kind of thought.&nbsp; She wasn’t angry or resentful, she was quietly ironing.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Her repetition of the “I want a wife” separates the activities, duties, jobs, and life of a wife.&nbsp; I think that if she didn’t have this repetition that all of these things would blend into one another and lose the effect of exactly how many things a wife does.  I can relate to this essay.&nbsp; This essay is me.&nbsp; I am a wife and a mom.&nbsp; I realized what it is that I do.&nbsp; I know what I do, but have thought about it all separately.&nbsp; When it is put down in black and white, in one essay, it is more powerful.&nbsp; The life of a wife is a tremendous task and I would expect that the burnout rate would be high and if it isn’t, why?&nbsp; I would be interested to know what it was that she felt after the realization of what her life entailed. &nbsp;Did she accept this description and continue to live her life this way, was she angry, or did life change in her marriage and her relationship with her husband, with regards to equality. &nbsp;&nbsp;This essay should be a mandatory read for husbands to be!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The author, Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver, is giving a detailed description of what her life is like in a nursing home in the essay, "My World Now. Throughout the essay, she describes how she has lost her privacy, independence and her freedom. She describes how one mundane day leads into another without any variation. Because one day is just like the next, it is difficult for her to know what day of the week it is. She talks about the residents with Alzheimer's who are not aware of where they are. I wonder if she isn't a little envious that they are not aware of their fate.   The author talks about the fact that even the employees don't stay long because it is not a desirable place to work.&nbsp;She states, "This is not the best job to have." They can move on to a better place of employment but she cannot.   My heart goes out to the author. Because people are living longer these days, they are often times unable to take care of themselves as they get older. Family structure is different today with both parents working and leading busy lives. The elderly can depend on their families to take care of them. They are forced to go to some kind of care facility to live out their days. They loose everything they have worked so hard for, even their privacy. I don't know what the answer is, I only know that my heart breaks every time I must go visit someone in the nursing home.

      In this essay written by Deborah Tannen pointed out that we as society go out of are way to pick weaak points out of a person speaking. This is more so with the media, even though we all have the freedom of speech. The media itself does pick a person more so then a regular person on the way they speak our what they have to say. Even I sit and listen to one talk I am not listening to what they have to say but what there weaknesses are in the story.

      After reading this essay I got a feeling that Judy Brady was getting the point across as a idea that all men want the same things in a wife and that if she wanted a wife, she would have her wife do the same thing as she stated in the essay. I though have to disagree with her essay for I think anyone and myself should let his wife do what she wants and make things 50/50 across the board in marrige.

      After reading "Fighting Back", written by Stanton L. Wormley, JR., I wondered what I would have done if I had been in his position.&nbsp; I would have probably handled things the same way that the author did. The author was raised in a "upper-middle-class black family" which tells us that life was different for him than other black people from the start. The author did not hold the resentment, anger and frustration that many poor black people hold. He did not have to fight for everything he had. Because of his social class, the author was not angry at all white men. He did not feel the contempt for the white man that the other black soldiers did. He felt like he was an equal to the white man which is why he did not fight back when first attacked.   I think the idea the author was trying to convey was that he almost felt ashamed for not fighting back in the first fight. He questioned his response to the fight wondering "Was I less of a man for not having beaten my attacker to a bloody pulp?" Self-defense and active and defiant fighting back were the two reasons the author felt&nbsp;that fighting back was justified. He felt that "fighting back" for the black man and other minority groups was a "statement of individual potency and self-determination." The author understood that by not fighting back, he had disgraced the entire black population.   In the authors second fight he did choose to fight back. I think he fought back because of all the guilt he had harbored&nbsp;from disgracing his people years ago and also, he was probably more aware of the discrimination that his people and other minority groups experience after serving in the military. He had experienced life other than the upper-middle class life he was accustomed to.   I found that I had great respect for the author admitting that after his second fight, he felt a "great sense of hollowness." Even though he was justified in retaliating and initially exhilarated by the fight, he did not like that he had become like the "others" and learned to fight back. What a good lesson that fighting never solves problems. No matter what.

      After reading "I Want a Wife", written by Judy Brady, I got the distinct idea that the author was feeling taken advantage of by her husband. Throughout the essay, she gave many examples of all the things that she would like a wife to do if she could have one. I think that what she was really saying is that she wanted some recognition and appreciation for all the things she does for everyone else on a daily basis. She wanted someone to pamper her and make sure that everything was taken care of for her.   I think the idea of this essay is to make us aware of all the things the "woman" or "wife" is expected to do for the family. Why is it the wife that always has to make the sacrifices? Why is it the wife that thinks of everyone else first?   This essay is so typical of families today. There are certainly exceptions to this stereo-typical relashionship between husband and wife, but for the most part, I am sure that a lot of "wives" can relate to what the author is talking about.   I liked the way the author ended the essay. I think what she was saying was, not only did her husband not appreciate her and all she does for him and the family, but he expects more. Somehow her husband puts no importance on his wives wants and desires. I never thought about it, but maybe I would like a wife also.&nbsp; :)   &nbsp;

      Inthis essay by Deborah Tannen She points out how as a society we like to argue in order to get our way. And that the media often does not give to side to an issue. Because they want to have you side with them. Which I think is wrong because how can we as a society make a fair judgement when we are only hearing half of the story. Even on talk shows people like to argue I think somethings they do this just to get attention. Why would you want to argue just to argue. It is a waste of time and of energy. And after a while no one wants to listen to you because all you want to do to them is have a fight and this is not right to the other person or people involved. We all argue. But arguing all the time is not good for your selfesteam and it make make people around you negative also. It can lead to anxity, depression, spouse abuse, child abuse and much more. I think this is one of the main problems in are society to day is that we can't talk problems out without someone yelling at the other person and this hurts everyone involved not just the people&nbsp; who are disagreing with each other.

      In this &nbsp;essay by Judy Brandy the author explains how a friend of hers recently got divorced, and had a child from a previous marriage and they got to talking and he told her that he wanted a new wife. That got Judy thinking how she wants a different wife.  One that will do everything a wife is suppoes to do while the husband is out making a living for the family. Well the reason that Judy wants a new wife is because she is doing everything including the man's job and that is not easy. In this essay I think that Brandy teaches you that the women should not have to do everything at home. But in many cases this is just the case. Well both parents may be working outside the home. The mother is mainly responsible for taking care of everything at home. It is not like women can't do anything that men can't but many think the "Leave it to Beaver" way. Where the mother is at home and may work outside the home occassional. While it is the fathers responsiblity to earn the living for the family. Leaving all the household duties to mom. I don't think this is right just because we have been classified as the more materinal gender. It would not kill a man to help out around the house. After all he lives there to. Even everyone in awhile take care of the inner family needs like making sure the kids are taken care of, appointments are scheduled, and even the housework is done. Many Women would apperciate this.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ideas I found in this essay writtne by Wormley, FIGHTING BACK, were drama and race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was treated unfairly because of the color of his skin.&nbsp; I just hate that.&nbsp; The drama I found was in his will not to fight back because this is how he was brought up.&nbsp; When confronted byanother black man of why he chose not to was something that he hadn't thought of.&nbsp; It hadn't entered his mind.&nbsp; The drama also was hitting the next guy in the stomach when he wouldn't leave him alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When translating this to reality, I find black race are not treated equal yet.&nbsp; I feel white people have more rights yet and the black race fights twice as hard as white people to prove themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a friend who transferred to my shool during the teen years.&nbsp; Noone seemed to want to help her find the classrooms.&nbsp; I helped her and we are friends to this day.&nbsp; She is native american and actually helped my self-esteem improve.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author, Stanton L. Wormley, Jr. in his essay, FIGHTING BACK, talks of his difficult upbringing as an only child and he still was adjusting, at eighteen, when he was an army private at Fort Jackson, S.C. where a drunken white soldier attacked him during his sleep and the thought of fighting back had not entered his mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, he was confronted angrily by a young black street wise soldier wondering why he didn't fight back.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a roadside diner in Virginia, Wormley was confronted again by a drunken white man making derogatory remarks at him.&nbsp; He did try ignore him and move but the man grabbed his shoulder.&nbsp; He pulled him up out of his chair and hit the drunk guy in the stomack, dropping him to the floor.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought of how this left him feeling good for the moment and then lost something by leaving him with a hollow feeling afterwards.&nbsp; In his upbringing, he was taught to think more than react.&nbsp; Fighting disgraced his black american population.&nbsp; He had a trace of sadness in knowing he had learned to fight back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found this essay sad in some parts.&nbsp; By this I am referring to race.&nbsp; It shouldn't matter what color you are.&nbsp; Wormley was judged by that; his color.&nbsp; I find this wrong.&nbsp; He was trying to do good for himself and drunken white ment were in the wrong by attacking him.&nbsp; They're the ones making white people look bad.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author, Judy Brady, in I WANT A WIFE, is good.&nbsp; I can see her point.&nbsp; As a mother, why not have someone, anyone to take care of us for a change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay makes her sound unhappy&nbsp; and exhaused in her role as a mother.&nbsp; She is ironing and what comes to her mind is, "Yeah, why not get or have a wife?"&nbsp; She's thinking of her divorced friend and sees why he wants someone.&nbsp; To take care of his needs and his one child.&nbsp; She almost sounds angry or bitter at the role she plays because I think her duties are unappreciative in her household. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, I'd like a wife too.&nbsp; In reality, it is a fifty-fifty deal to me.&nbsp; Working together, because an income now-a-days takes two people to make it in this world today and with that I would say, "IT TAKES TWO!" to accomplish the routine of everyday life.&nbsp; When both making incomes, there needs to be an agreeable arrangement of working together in the home equally, as partners so transitions can run smoothly as possible.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The auther, Judy Brady, in I WANT A WIFE, starts out&nbsp; with a male friend, recently divorced, who has one child with his ex-wife and now looking for another wife. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She goes on talking of how she thought of him when ironing one night and how she'd like a wife for herself, meaning for someone to take care of her and run errands, keeep track of dental and doctor appointments, mend clothes, feed kids, arrange school events, take them to the park and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While reading this essay, I found her repetition in wanting a wife mentioned over and over again.&nbsp; Things such as, "I want a wife to take care&nbsp;of my children," or "I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick," or "I want a wife who will take care&nbsp;of the babysitting arrangements or wanting a wife who is faithful, honest, entertains, and is a good cook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay sounds like the woman is the jack of all trades and does more than a man has to.&nbsp; In the world today,&nbsp; this essay leaves the reader with false accusations.&nbsp; In the way wives nurture others, I find this si habit in being brought up.&nbsp; Today, roles have changes with the mother working and the father watching and raising kids.&nbsp; Today, it is whatever works out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people are single parents, such as myself, doing the "Mr. Mom."&nbsp; Every household is different so this essay I find distracting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like she is unhappy in her role of motherhood.&nbsp; I think, by nature, mothers are nurturers at heart.&nbsp; Most of us are.&nbsp; I believe some of it comes natural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a single parent, it is oberbearing at times but I love my kids.&nbsp; They have responsibility with helping when I haven't a spouse to rely on.&nbsp; Sometimes that would be nice.&nbsp; I've adjusted to the single parent role.&nbsp; I may not always like it but I do what I can.

      In this essay, Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver is writing from how she see's her world now, compares to before. She writes about the treatment she gets while living where she does, and how it makes her feel less like a human. She explains how she spends a typical day, either in bed or watching T.V. Anna explains what happens when people die and how it's just like another day for the workers, and she also tells about the comforts of the wheelchair.  I like this essay because it's not a essay thats all complaining. As a reader I can tell she's not complaining, she's just trying to open others eyes as to how she feels and how she's treated now that she's in a nursing home. She tells about her world before and how it is now. I can tell she excepts why she's there, it's just hard to except how she's treated.

      Judy Brady wrote this essay from a wives perspective of a wife. More so of wife, writing from how she is seen by her husband eyes. She writes from how she feels he sees her, and wants her to act. After reading this essay "I Want A Wife" the reader can tell that this relationship isn't a two way ordeal, it's more of the wife doing all the giving and the husband doing all the recieving. Basically the only similarities betweent them are that they both are living for "him". She's working to care for him, and so is he. For most women this essay could be quite similar to their own lives, how the husband are so dependant upon their wives.Growing up and seeing how my parents are together, I can say this essay is nothing like them. My parents are equal with everything, they share all the responsibilities, and really respect eachother.  I liked this essay because it was true. It was written from experience, and after reading it, I could tell that the writer wrote this because she needed to get her feelings out. She probable felt it was the only way she could be heard, and understood.

      Anna Mae Halgrin Seaver's Essay My World Now shares the life of an 84 year old woman in a nursing home. she shares her feelings on being old and how she feels neglected and how her feelings do not seem to matter.I think the tone of this essay is one of reflection. The woman in&nbsp; the essay is sharing how she feels to have everything taken away from her.&nbsp; TO be put into a place where she is forced to have a roommate and when there is nothing to live for anymore. When she was counting the minutes till lunch i thinkthat it was the writers way of really making us see howlife was for her in a nursing home. I dont think that i could be happy in a home. I am a free spirited person and i dont want anyone to take that away from me. They cant.

      In the Essay I Want aWife, the author Judy Brady, Writes of her experiences as a wife and a woman. I think that she is trying to share her feelings on the work that is required of her as a woman. I think that the ideas in this essay are trying to portray How she is tired of being the one in her family to do all of the work. I thinkthat a woman should be more than a mom and a nurse. The woman's job is becoming more flexible and less restrictive. I think that brady's essay is one that shows how she feels when all things are said and done.

      I found this essay to be weird, although I loved the way Cynthia Williams, the author described her experiences with garbage. I guess I can see what she is talking about, how the garbage itself is lonely. I can only imagine that she herself must be lonely. Although I do believe that she may require some psychiatric help, she does have a way with garbage and how it relates to her life, first coming and then going. I do believe that we all should take the resposibility for our waste. But I don't believe that one should thrive in it.

      I found this essay to be very one sided. The author Judy Brady was simply trying to state every aspect of a womans life that chooses to be this way, bitter. I'm sorry she's not appreciated, she chooses to have these feelings on the basis of her mate. I have not, and do not condone the way the author speaks in this essay because she obviously thinks she is much more than equal to a male. She has deffinatley made some bad decisions in her life if she thinks that all of the things she describes are of her&nbsp;own responsibility. She makes me mad to think that there are people out there that have no respect, either for themselves or their mate. I believe that a relationship is a 50/50 venture and that in itself deserves respect.

      I liked this essay because I can incorporate the idea of him wanting to retaliate. He doesn't retaliate the first time because he was raised not to. His idea is when do we retaliate and what does it take for us not to retaliate? I think that retaliation is something we all fight as a silent battle within each and all of us. I know I do. I am made fun of, talked about at worked, teased, and meant to feel bad. This man feels the same way because of his color. He is proud of being black but everyone else is scared because of his color. People are afraid of the unknown. This man was the stronger man because he didn't fight back the first time but when he fought back the second time he felt ashamed because he had let the monster fighting inside out to show his true feelings of what he feels about people who retaliate against black people just because they are black.

      This essay made me mad. I read this essay at least three times and the more I read it the more it made me angry. First of all at the beginning of this essay I couldn't decide if this author was male or female it really was a confusing idea. The idea of this essay was wanting a wife because of what duties a wife has or takes on in her role as a wife. I think that the author to this essay was basically bringing out the sterotypes put on wives. I am a wife and I don't do all those things all the time. My husband shares the responsibility or we take turns. This essay sounds like it's from&nbsp;a males perspective who wants to be free and wants a mother not a wife someone to wait on him hand and foot so he can take credit for the wife's hard work while he just looks important. This was not a good essay I feel because he makes it sound like the old days when the wife used to do it all and that is the way it is now. Well it's not. It takes two to run a household and the household shares all the responsibility of running the house.

      Deborah Tannen, the author of this essay, presents all the ways that people try be a critic. One example is how the media preys on public interest by posing difficult questions which catch the interviewees off guard. When we as listeners hear these questions, we assume this is the generally held opinion of our society.  &nbsp;She points out that the path to truth is not necessarily as easy as it appears. There are many ways we try to get there, including public discourse, finding the weak spots in the people you are debating and trying to find “the other side.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is definitely an easy essay to relate to the real world. Face it, we do these things. We argue just to argue. We attack another’s point of view just because it doesn’t tango with ours. We even lie sometimes because we are just so sure we know the other person is not telling the truth. We can have no way of knowing for sure what another is thinking or that they are intentionally lying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved the illustration of the irate talk show guest. I have always been disgusted with anger-driven talk shows where none of the issues are really presented and it’s all a bunch of screaming fanatics who don’t listen to a single word of what the other person is saying, except to attack it and call them raving lunatics. It’s sad that it has gotten to this point. People don’t want to hear both sides, they want to see these “distinguished guests” holler near obscenities at each other. Arguing for just for the sake of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justification for inappropriate behavior. The first paragraph illustrated this. When a journalist was asked why she had to attack others so she could be right, she replied, “It’s an argument.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay got me thinking about my own life personally. I don’t want to end up a bitter old woman with opinions so set that she is blinded to what might really be true. I liked this lengthy line, “But when opposition becomes the overwhelming avenue of inquiry, when the lust for opposition exalts extreme views and obscures complexity, when our eagerness to find weaknesses blinds us to strengths, when the atmosphere of animosity precludes respect and poisons our relations with one another, then the culture of critique is stifling us.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It really sums up the whole point of his essay. I’m not sure if this is what Julie meant by putting the ideas behind essays into real life. Sorry if I misunderstood!

      In this essay by Judy Brady, she tells all the reasons that she would personally want a wife. Being a wife, she wishes SHE had a wife to do all of the things that she has to do. I get the impression that she really doesn't like her position in the family. Obviously she has some pride in what (or rather, how many things) she does, but she doesn't seem to get much appreciation. In a way she is presenting her own life through her husband's eyes and I have a feeling all is not well in paradise. &nbsp;This essay is probably well received by many wives. I am not a wife myself (hallelujah, a shaft of light and angelic voices), but I liked it. I get mad at myself when I take my mother for granted and just basically anyone in my life. And it's so doggon easy to do. &nbsp;&nbsp; Many wives probably feel this way. Problem after problem arises and they are expected to handle it because the man has been "working all day." It's a pity that this author felt so frustrated that she had to write something like this. It's a pity she felt she needed a wife. It's a pity she felt unappreciated and harried. I'm sure Brady voiced what many women wish to voice. But I wonder, how many men are feeling this way, too? The grass is always greener.........

      Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver’s essay “My World Now” is a very insightful essay about the treatment of elderly people in nursing homes. It also allows us to see what people in nursing home are thinking day to day. Seaver exposes the idea that nursing homes are very lonely, not very dignifying, and very boring.  &nbsp;  All of these ideas go through my very own head at work everyday. I work in a nursing home and often wonder how boring it must be. Everything seems to be revolved around breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and finally another snack. Seaver’s expresses this when she describes her day of getting up early, waiting for breakfast and then pondering waiting in the dining room for lunch. Obviously she feels that there is not much to look forward to during the day other then the meals that are served.  &nbsp;  Seaver expresses the idea that aides in a nursing home don’t take time to listen. I know that this is a fact. Many times, I find that we are very short on help and even though we would like to take time to chat, we just don’t have that luxury. I feel it a tragedy that we are forced to run around like chickens with our heads cut off when all these people want most of the time is someone to listen. I also think that people are encouraged not to get too close to the resident by spending a lot of time with them. I have had experiences where I was taking the extra few minutes that I had to visit with a certain resident who was telling me all about his kids. When I was spotted doing this by a co worker, I was told that I shouldn’t get so close. I didn’t look at this as getting close; I looked at it as caring.  &nbsp;  Overall the feelings that are expressed in this essay are very much valid. I can not imagine having to live in an environment like a nursing home especially if I had my mind about me as Seaver does in this essay.

      As I read the essay, “My World Now,” I was compelled to think of the people that I see everyday at work. I work in a nursing home and can relate to the things that this lady is experiencing. I often wonder what these people did or enjoyed when they were younger. Many times while working though, we as aides unfortunately don’t have the time to stop and ask or listen as we would like. I find it refreshing to have a day when we are not short of help on the floor and can spend the time that is deserved these people under our care.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I Want a Wife” written by Judy Brady is an essay that seems to rally for sympathy for wives. Brady explains throughout the essay all of the reasons that she would want a wife and what she would expect them to do. She also writes that if she had a wife she would have the right to find a new wife if she so desired. I get the feeling that Brady, a wife herself, does not like the position that she is in.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a very strong idea presented in this essay that wives have many expectations placed on them by there spouse, family, and society. These expectations are expressed in a negative way in this essay. For two entire pages Brady writes phrases and ideas such as, “I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean.” “I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t feel that there is anything wrong in wanting a wife to do these things. However, I get the feeling from this essay that Brady does not get the same respect from her spouse as she is expected to put out. I feel that each spouse has a role in there family. If my husband were to make enough money that I could stay home, I would. I would then have no problem doing all of the cooking, cleaning, pleasuring. Reality however, is different. In the real world of today, many families have both spouses working. When this is the case, the husband and wife should share the house hold responsibilities.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly feel that if life is so rough for Brady, then maybe she should start looking for a new husband just as their friend is looking for a new wife.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      “Fighting Back” is an essay that is very compelling to think about. Naturally, one may think or feel the same way Morris did in the essay and wonder why Wormley did not fight back. Fighting back for so many is just an instinct that is done before thought has a chance to take place. Wormley however was raised to think before he acted. I really liked this essay for pointing out that fighting back may not always be the best answer. Sometimes thinking your way through a situation may lead you to a better result and feeling about yourself.

      Jennifer Parkhurst  One Page Paper  Julie Lundblad  July 20, 2004  Reaction to The Right To Die  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norman Cousins, in his essay The Right To Die, talks about a married couple at the end of their life. They felt if they weren’t able to take care of themselves they why take you the space. They didn’t want their lives prolonged. It was their rights if they wanted to live. In the essay the man said, “We are not afraid to die….” This was their right to live.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essay was a narrative essay because someone else is telling the store of Van Dusen. It used repetition to reinforce the point of the essay. They didn’t like the fact of taking up space when other people need help. In religion, the human mind finds a larger dimension and is relieved of the ordeal of a confrontation with non-existence. Death is not the greatest loss in life. These are some of the examples from the essay. The tone of the essay was sad.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the essay because it is true. People should have the right to choose if they want to live or not. The last paragraph in the essay; death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live. The unbearable tragedy is to live without dignity or sensitivity. It makes a good point that people who go into nursing homes loss their dignity. That is why they give up and the greatest loss dies inside them. This essay made me think a lot of what the elderly think. It also gave me ideas of how to write more essays.

      I really liked how William Zinsser started out his introduction in comparison to something most everyone can relate to. Clutter is like fighting weeds, a person has to weed out the ones that don't fit or look good.  &nbsp; I really liked how in his essay he gave numerous examples. It didn't really keep my attention the whole time; in the beginning I was really interested, but towards the end I lost that intrest. I think he was throwing a lot of information into this essay, it was almost overwhelming how he jumped around so much. But all together it was a pretty good essay that pointed out different aspects of cluttering.

      I think E.B White used a great deal of imagery and emotion when writing this story on part in particular caught my eye. “They stayed indoors, kept warm, and ate well, and when there was nothing better to do, they played crokinole. The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay.” Mr. White gave me as a reader an essay of great contrast and details to make me feel the Dwelling of this family falling apart.

      I think Norman is talking from his point of view on suicide and how much of it is none sense to the common folk and that we as humans must see all sides of it before judging one on his our her actions. I think there is one great part to this essay that describes this very well. “Even without respect to religion, the idea of suicide has been abhorrent throughout history. Some societies have imposed severe penalties on the families of suicides in the hope that the individual who sees no reason to continue his existence may be deterred by stigma his self-destruction would inflict on loved ones.” I feel this is the point that he wanted to get across.

      Jennifer Parkhurst  One Page Paper  Julie Lundblad  July 19, 2004  Reaction to The Family Which Dwelt Apart  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.B. White wrote an essay called The Family Which Dwelt Apart, it was about a family that lived on a island far from people. They would go off the island when they needed something from the town. One winter they were stuck on this island because of the bad whether. Someone in town heard that one of the kids of the Pruitt had appendicitis and sent people to help them. Some of the people died and they tried to help the boy but he ended up dying anyway. The house burned to the ground and the last boy found a town to live in.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tone of the story was up bet. The story showed the start with the best place and time to put the reader in the right mindset to absorb details when it starts on an island and the boy appendicitis ruptured. It showed a family on a small island living the way they wanted to live. Then the storm broke out and they were trapped on the island with no resource. Finally the boy died and the brother moved away.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like this essay because it showed a happy beginning and a sad ending. I liked the part where the whole town tried to help them off the island. It showed how people help each other.

      &nbsp;In the begining of the essay wrote&nbsp;by author William Zinsser he discusses how fighting clutter is like fighting weeds and how new varities are always sprouting up over night. When I first read this story I thought that he was talking about the clutter that we have in our lives through material possesions. But as I read on I soon came to realize that he meant through one's writing and how as a society we have learned to not be able to cut to the chase. Throughout this essay he states that we should simplifly&nbsp;our lives by looking at our writing and changing it. I know that this might seem hard but it can be done so says the author&nbsp;of Clutter. So Simplify, sinplify and your life will be better. &nbsp;

      The essay "Women in the wild blue younder" discusses the right for women to do anything that they want to exspecially fly in combat. I don't see why women should not be allowed to do this because like the author states they could get hurt in any other job that they do. One point in this story that puzzles me is the question Can a nurturer also be a destroyer? But when you look at the issue women have been involved in the war forces for many years. Yes as many different parts and yes never as combat flyers. But we have still played an active role in the one thing that keeps are country safe and I think that is very important.

      I grew up in a Christian home that suicide is against God and we will not be able to go to heaven. I can sympathize with Dr. Van Dunsen and his wife in taking their lives. I would want to take my life if I had a serious illness that I couldn't handle. I agree that I would feel like I was taking up a space in the world, too.  I don't see it that way when an elderly gets sick, I'm one of those that would like to take care of them. I would be there for them when they want to talk.

      This was a crazy story, one that as I was reading didn't expect to end the way it did. The writer wrote in a tone that was relaxed and calm; I assumed by the title that they just all went their seperate ways in life. It was written in more of a story than an essay. &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of crazy I should actually say it was more Ironic. The people that came to help them out and save them, actually end up killing them, another thing I didn't expect. Everything happened so suddenly, I had to read it twice to see if what happened actually happened. Right away I didn't know what to think, I had some mixed emotions and thoughts. All around it was an okay essay.

      I found the title, "The family which Dwelt Apart" fit the essay perfectly.&nbsp; Seven on an island that end up stranded with mentioning of appendicitus set off huge problems with state troopers sending a rescue squad and three lost their lives.&nbsp; I found this essay to be confusing.&nbsp; I had to read it&nbsp;twice.&nbsp; I did like it.&nbsp; After figuring out E.B. White uses a tell-tale,this helped put these images in my mind and I find this can't be possible for all this to happen.&nbsp; The pruitts died from drinking carbolic acid that was left behind by the surgeon whic Pa Pruitt had mistaken for alcohol.&nbsp; The oldest boy charles returns giving his family decent burial and returns to the mainland. I find E.B. white uses imagination in the essay and as I am reading this,&nbsp; I find my emotions going in all sorts of directions.&nbsp; One minute, I'm shocked and another I am chuckling because of the detailed work with so many bizarre incidents.&nbsp; The reader is keeping my attention in the story with different events going on. I found the essay powerful, sad, and hilarious.&nbsp; A Hard-to-Believe Story.

      I must admit that even after reading this story a number of times, I am&nbsp;still confused. Did the author want us to be&nbsp; confused? Was this story written for the humor?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The author certainly demonstrated how one misunderstanding can lead to another misunderstanding and so on. What confused me the most was, who ever led anyone to believe that anyone had appendicitis? The author mentioned&nbsp; it at the beginning of the story for what seemed like a random statement and before you knew it, the whole thing got blown out of proportion.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I like the authors statement, "The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay." This statement kind of summed up the whole story. The Pruitts were very happy and content until someone assumed that they were not. I found the setting of a "remote island" to very appropriate for the story. The Pruitts found the isolation they desired, but by doing so, they actually made more problems for themselves. The lack of contact with society created more chaos than had they checked in on a regular basis and not let people wonder what was happening.

      This story reminds me of my Grandmother. She too was an artist that was not allowed to follow her passion because she was a female.  &nbsp;  At first I thought that this story was actually being written by Mary Cassatt because of the great detail given by the author throughout the story. I realized&nbsp;towards the end that it was actually written by her niece.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;The author did such a nice job describing and creating a mental image of Mary Cassatt from her desire to be an artist to the sacrifices she made in order to fulfill her dream. I like the statement the author used, "She typifies one kind of independent American spinster who keeps reappearing in our history in forms as various as Margaret Fuller and Katharine Hepburn." The author demonstrated a deep understanding of these woman, from their love life to their old age. Thank goodness there were woman, and still are, that dare to go against what society "believes" they woman should do.  &nbsp;  I found it ironic and sad that Mary Casatt lost her eye site in her old age. Her art was the focus of her whole life and then to not be able to see. . . .&nbsp; Her life was truly a lonsome life but she felt she had accomplished her goal.

       I found this essay ironic in that I recently went to a garage sale at a storage facility.&nbsp; They were holding a sale for items that were in storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner stopped paying their storage fees, moved, or the item were repossessed for inability to pay rent.&nbsp; I came across a picture of an older lady.&nbsp; From the looks of the frame and the clothes that the lady wore, it was from the seventies.&nbsp; I wondered too if she had had family or had passed away and this was what was left of her.&nbsp; I felt saddened at the thought of this picture sitting up against the table, on the floor, dirty.&nbsp; Where were her daughters and sons?&nbsp; Why would they let a picture of her mother lay there like that?  &nbsp;  When Julie mentions “If they had family – that’s the one that sticks in my throat- if they had family, could they be this forgotten, this neglected”, this saddened me.&nbsp; I am from a close family and this made me think that I am fortunate and blessed.  &nbsp;  The last paragraph brings to my mind how we sometimes will judge others, come to conclusions, and stereotype or assume things before we know and see the whole  picture .

      This essay…my, where to start. My opinion is the same after reading this essay as it was before. I think it was masterfully written and if I wasn’t already so strongly decided on this issue, I most likely would have tilted towards Cousin’s viewpoint. I am 100 percent against assisted suicide. I believe it is completely and totally not up to us to decide when our lives should be over. I think it is up to God, who has an infinitely vaster and greater perspective on what is going on in this nutty world. *Blushes and steps off her soapbox.*  I can recognize how people would disagree with me and this essay certainly points them out. Mentioning a prominent couple who chose to murder themselves, the author brought us to the reality that it’s an issue we all have to face.  Again, had I not been clearly decided on suicide, I might have been swayed by the author’s persuasive and almost inescapable examples. I cannot and will not agree with him though.

      It was rather thought provoking. I was expecting an essay on packrats, even when I had already skimmed it. It was sort of hard for me because I love big words and meshing them together. I do get sick of all the pre-canned phrases and conversation starters though. In this essay the author certainly gave a lot of examples. Almost too many in my opinion. Each one made sense and opened my eyes more to the growing clutter in our language, but I almost got sick of this essay. Just my opinion. It's one of those essays I'm not sure if I like or not. I just read it, so give me a moment.... I can see his point. In some ways we're losing ourselves in all the expected phrases and socially acceptable conversations.  I thought it was funny how this author certainly wasn't shy with "big" words and long sentences. It was almost...cluttered.

       This story reaffirms the teaching in class Wednesday night. It helped me to rethink and restructure my writing while strengthening my resolve to do it better. William Zinsser shows clear examples of how many adjectives are unnecessary in our writing. I don’t know if I’ll be able to change my speech habits, but there is something I can do with my writing. Writing for retail sales you are taught to be very descriptive. This may be how some of these extraneous words were introduced into our language.

       I found this a difficult story to read, but would like to comment on it.    &nbsp;  If you're not aware what time period Mary Cassatt lived in, quotes from the first paragraph help you to define the period. "I would rather see you dead", her father said of her decision to become a painter. Even painter Degas said, "I am not willing to admit that a woman can draw that well".    &nbsp;  The author continues she talks about the "paradoxes of the woman artist",&nbsp;what Mary would have to overcome and the things she had going for her.&nbsp;The time period is mentioned when Mary's mother dies and you understand even more the issues that Mary faced. Even after 28 years abroad as a "renowned Impressionist painter" a Philadelphia newspaper said, "She has been studying painting in France and owns the smalles Pekingese dog in the world."    &nbsp;  They down played her renown, nothing was mentioned about all the famous painters who esteemed their female colleague.

      The author, William Zinsser describes his essay, "CLUTTER"&nbsp;deeply.&nbsp; One example, "at this point in time"&nbsp;is simplified with the word "now".&nbsp; To examine every word on paper is hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He states "her personal physician" to be "her doctor."&nbsp;&nbsp;Zinsser mentions&nbsp;clutter being the enemy in any form.&nbsp; He mentions&nbsp;starting out clutter is like fighting weeds.&nbsp; This will smother what you write.&nbsp; He quotes many examples&nbsp;like invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quote, "This will interest you"? is more likely to&nbsp;distract the readers attention finding it dull.&nbsp; The writer is speaking of unnecessary words and ends with the last sentance, "Simplify, simplify." Zinsser uses repitition throughout his essay.&nbsp; One example is, "It's raining."&nbsp; The weatherman&nbsp;says, "At the present time we are experiencing precipition.&nbsp; This is unnecessary jargon.&nbsp; His essay points this out clearly with his many examples. I found this essay hilarious.&nbsp; I liked how he stated his examples from long sentances to one word.&nbsp; I enjoyed the words we eliminated last week.&nbsp; His last sentance I found to be powerful with the word simplify.&nbsp; He used one word instead of saying, "Cut your Clutter."

      I found this essay very interesting? I now know that I am not he only one that looks at old photograghs and wonders why they are not on a family members wall. They must be someones great-grandparents or relative.  The questions that the author asked "who it was that sold a family treasure...?", ".... a relative who can not name the face or family?" were very intriguing and brought even more questions to my mind.  Ithink of my grandmother who has pictures from a hundred years past of her great-grandpartents and those of my grandfather as well when I read this essay. To her the pictures mean so much. Every time that we are together, she has a new picture that she has found or figured out just how they are related to her children and their children. However, I feel callous at times when I am not that interested because I can tie no personal memories or attachments to these people.

      This essay was hillarious and sarcastic. I loved the say that he pointed out the multiple extra fluff words and expressions that we use in our english language everyday and we are now accustom to hearing. We don't even think twice when the weather man states, "At the present time we are experiencing precipitation." That is just the way they talk and we take their language as a part of them. Never have I heard a professional weather man state, "It's raining" and leave it at that. Is the jargon really what makes these people professionals in so many peoples minds?

      Jennifer Parkhurst One Page Paper Julie Lundblad July 14, 2004 Reaction to Picnics and Milk 	Stacy Jurgens, her paper Picnics and Milk, was a story of a little girl and her family. It starts on her grandparent’s farm where her family lives out in a trailer. Both of the little girls would go out and get milk for super everyday. She then describes her father and all the hard work he does for his family. The mother and father cared for each other. At the end they had a picnic and her parents were deeply in love. 	The essay I thought was an illustration essay it gives ideas and pictures of the story. For example, we would have supper on the table and large cool glass of milk setting at each place. The little girls would get the milk from the barn and her father coming to help them with the milk to the house. She also gave realistic images of her parents in the long grass kissing.  	I like to essay. It had a lot of feeling and illustration. It showed that you can use a memory of your past and describe it. I thought was a great writer. What I like the most form this essay is the last paragraph, these memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday. It shows her feelings for her parents and that she too wants to be a good parent for her children.

      Before I had read this piece, my view of suicide was that it was wrong, a selfish act, against what the Catholic Church believes, and an easy way out of a difficult situation.  After I read this my views are open a little more to the thought that there are other logical, ethical, and moral issues out there other than my closed views.  Some thoughts that I found in the essay that were of interest to me were, "They didn't like the idea of taking up space in a world with too many mouths and too little food.", "They believed it was a misuse of medical science to keep them technically alive., "what they were turning against was the notion that there were no circumstances under which life should be discontinued.", and "life can beprolonged by science far beyond meaning or sensibility."  The one sentence that made me really stop to think about suicide is "The general reaction to suicide is bound to change as people come to understand that it may be a denial, not an assertion, of moral or religious ethics to allow life to be extended without regard to decency or pride."  This also lends me to think that what other denials in our life to we hold onto and attach a moral or religious ethic or excuse onto so that we don't have to face the truth?

           I really enjoyed this essay.  Even though I did not grow up on a farm, Stacy's description of her childhood easily crosses over to mine.  It brought images of my grandparents and picnics with my family to mind.  It also brought back images of my sister and I and the little sneaky things we used to try to get away with.  Especially when she says "stolen sips of whole milk" and "standing there with my sisters peeking at my kissing parents through the long grass.      I like the last paragraph in that she talks about how she wants for her children what she had growing up.  I think that we all want more for our children.  In wanting that for them, we sometimes forget to also instill hard work and determination and to not forget the simple things are sometimes the best in life.

      In Limited seating on Broadway, THe author John Hockenberry refers to the mistreatment of those with dissabilities. When he mentioned about the theater and how they did not take ticket orders over the phone for people with dissabilities. I think that the writer of this essay made it plain right there that the theater discriminated against disabled persons.The MAnager comes out wavimg a copy of a policy for disabled patrons like it was the bible. AFter humiliatin the author he then proceeds to show him to the door or the floor in his case.           Hockenberry uses this story to not only share how it felt to be a person with dassabilities, but also to show a side of people that is usually not ever shown to anyone.A persons fear can prevent someone from getting to know those that are different.THe author used very discriptive words in describing how he was treated.          Discrimination of people with special needs is not only moraly wrong but it is also a crime that many people commit on an every day basis and dont even know it. When people can accept everyone they will not have all of the problems that they would normally have.

      I think that the author John HockenBerry describes just how it feels for a person with any type of disability. I thought this idea was carried very well through out the essay. Some examples of this harsh treatment includes how the manager of the theater was unwilling to help him enjoy the theatoical proformace. How he had to carry a bottle of urine fourty blocks because there was not a suitable restroom for him to use. I really found it instresting on how he tells us about the proposal for handicapped accessible public restrooms on public streets and how the city opposed puting them in because the Public Art Commission had stated that the structure were just too ugly. No one should have to feel insucure just because they have a disability. They should have the same rights as everyone else. No matter what your race, age, or type od disability you have.

      In this story I feel the author used very good imagery. Right from the begining he gave me this feeling. He opeing sentance was using great emotion and imagery and I feel there is not to many other words of choice to tell you how well he does throughout the essay with using in great depth what it was like in the prison on a exceution day. A good example of the author's imagery start like this " Two of them stood by with rifles and fixed bayonets, while the others handcuffed him, passed a chain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts, and lashed his arms tight to his sides." To me this gives me great imagination what the prisoner was going through and what the guards were doing.

      When John Hockenberry speaks about the art community in New York City, you would never guess where this story was leading and I like that.  In the second paragraph he speaks of them as having, "a reputation for being progressive."  He then goes on to say, "the theater world likes to think of itself as a seeker of such challenges and is proudest when a play or musical becomes a vehicle for change."  It doesn't look like they were being much of a "vehicle for change" as the manager told him he'd have to leave.  It seems that all the people in the arts community couldn't have cared less since no one dared to step forward to help him or defend his right to be there.  I noticed the reinforced authority of the manager as he was holding the copy of "Policy for Disabled Patrons".  The irony of this story is spelled out in the author's last sentence, "Art and theater are nothing if not honest."

      I was not excepting to read about a guy that was in a wheelchair. I feel his anger about the house manager coming over with a policy for disabled patrons, they should of told him that when he bought the tickets. I don't think that its right to not have a theater accessible to any one.

      I found it interesting how the story about the authors love for her garden evolved into a story about her nephews, and how her garden helped her work out the problems she was having with them. I love how she refers to her garden as a friend. I can relate to this. She talks about how she finds solace in working the soil and how pulling weeds relaxes her. When something is troubling her she goes to her garden to work out her problems.  She talks about her difficulty having children and her disapproval of her brother and sister-in-laws divorce. She talks about how the divorce has affected her nephews from "her perspective." For example,the author feels, "They have been forced prematurely into adulthood and hide the scars of their pain under layers of affected indifference." Is this indeed the case? Are not all 15 year olds indifferent to the world other then themselves? Could it be that because she has not raised children yet herself, that she can not understand this. She also states, "I have learned to force thoughts of the two of them wandering the streets with their other "latch-key" friends from my mind." Are they truly wandering or is she a little jealous because she might think, had these been the children she could not have, she would have done something differently. It is very easy to judge others until we have actually been put in the same situation.   I feel the author raises some very valid points but I am also glad that she realizes that these are not her children to raise and she has done the right thing by, "praying that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish." She can not protect them by building a fence around them as she stated. Her garden, and friend, has helped her to realize this.

      I found this essay to be very thought provoking. The author was writing this story from first hand experience. I found it interesting how at first, the author referred to the prisoner as "a puny wisp of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes." It was if the author had to somehow justifying they were doing, by finding some negative qualities in the prisoner. The author never did state what the prisoners crime had been.   As the Essay unfolded, the author began to realize that not only was this a prisoner, but he was also a human being with feelings, just like his own. For example, when the author stated,"Once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped lightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path. It is curious; but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide."  It seemed that all of the people involved in the hanging had become desensitized to what they were doing. I think that the dog that showed up threw them all off guard because the dog was so innocent and unaware of what was going on. I think the dog symbolized the reality of what they were actually doing.  Even the superintendent, also the doctor, had a hard time declaring the man "dead". He only said, "He's all right." I assumed he could not say the word dead because then he would have to take some responsibility for his death.   I think this essay was about the author realizing that these prisoners were human beings, just like himself and what they were doing was not acceptable. He also found himself questioning how quickly life returned to normal as they got further away from where the hanging had taken place.

      I thought this was a wonderful story. You could tell that the author wrote this with thoughts of love, happiness and a great feeling of security.   Throughout the story, the author used many examples describing the love she felt from her family. For example, "We saw no problem with our parents sneaking some afternoon loving into their busy days. There's a good feeling you get, even at the age of five, when you see your parents madly in love with each other." She also talked about the teasing that went on amongst the family members. I think this teasing suggests that she was very secure in their love.   I think the most significant statement the author made was at the end of the story. She stated, "These memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday. I want them to appreciate what they have and work for what they get, just as my sister and I did with the milk." I think this statement speaks for itself because, why would you want to raise your own children as you had been raised if it wasn't a wonderful experience?

          In george Orwell's short essay "A Hanging" He starts his story in Burma. There is a hindu man condemed to death. I found it interseting how first of all the Hindu Man's crime was never menntioned. I think that made one to wonder if a crime had even been committed. As the writer uses extreamly descriptive words he leads us with him on that fatefull morning that a hanging occured. WE are able to follow the superintendants every step of the way to the final hanging. I do wonder what signnificance the stray dog had to the man and the story. I think that the writer was trying to make a connection to animals and humans in pain.

      I thought it was very moving. I feel her pain that she has about how the parents handled the divorce and how they are acting after the divorce. We want to help kids that are struggling because of family situations. I feel her pain that she has to set back and let the parents be, sometime all we can do is just be there for them when they need somoene to just talk, too.  I liked how Deb Sullivan called her garden her friend and how she compared the twin nephews and the garden on how they were the same. Like when she was saying that she planted them in her world, build a fence around them to keep them safe, and how she has "weed out" their negatives out of their lives. You can very clearly see how much she lovs Jake and Ben.

      When I finished reading this essay,  I think the whole story relates to how John Hockenberry talks of places such as the Virginia Theatre and public restrooms and how those in wheelchairs or others who are handicapped are treated unfairly. Why not put in a ramp at the theatre?  This is a question I thought of when reading this. The part with the bottle of urine I found to be unusual.  I also find I think the reason for this is because the public restrooms make no room and doesn't seem like they try to hard to accomplish a restroom for people who are handicapped, in wheelchairs or otherwise. The author grabs me from the getgo.  The high price of pay for handicapped people in wheelchairs, the usher being very rude.  This really was getting me upset and angry.  I can just imagine how he must of felt. I think people in wheelchairs are still human and need even more respect because, to no fault of their own, noone asks to be in a wheelchair or otherwise.  If possible, people need to be kind and generous and treat them with utter respect.  Can you tell. This story got my blood boiling because of the way in him being unfairly from my point of view. The part of the two attendants throwing him out of his wheelchair really is out of  proportion.  It isn't right that he was going to dump his urine here.  He could have went home but maybe he needed to so he could use it again. All in all, the story just got me upset with the handicapped being treated unfairly, in every respect.

           I can relate to this story.  I like the part how Deb Sullivan refer to her Garden as a friend.  I think this is  because she sees it as her place of sanity and finds peace and feels free being in her garden.      The story continues with her raking up leaves and then talk of thinking of nurture of animals, humans, and plants in her garden.  She goes into detail of how people tell her that her husand and herself would make great parents and then how they can't have children.  They have thought of adoption but that gets nowhere and the years continue to slip away.      Deb Sullivan then has a focus of her nephews, Ben and Jake.  They are fifteen years old and identical twins.  She loved them from the start with a deep passion.  Probably because this is where she felt closest to someone when not being able to have any children of her own.  They created good memories going camping, boating, and more.      Tragedy strikes with the parents of these boys getting divorced and everything changes.  From Deb Sullivans' point, these boys now have a shattered life.  They have been forced prematurely into adulthood.  She finds she has tears on her face from a cool breeze drifting by and wipes her face.     Her attention turns back to the garden when she wipes dirt from her face from the tears.  She talks of planting Jake and Ben in her Garden wanting nothing more than to keep them safe and nurture them tenderly and to keep them safe from the harsh elements of life.     She realizes she has helped these boys by spending time with them and so refers to it as planting a seed in their lives.  She will continue to pray for them and in hope that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish in their lives.  She has helped to weed out the negatives in their life and also has helped them to make right choices.  She now stands back to watch them grow and turns to her garden, to her peaceful and quite place that gives her comfort where she can be free from the worries of life.     This was a great story and in my own life, with being divorced with two girls, I watched the pain on their face also.  In the end, it now worked out better all the way around.  I never say anything bad of their dad and I tell them it is not their fault.  They are enjoying time with him now.  I know they love me also and I do feel he does the same.  Letting them know I love them and it is not their fault.  I spent time in my own garden when I was married so this story is great.  I wouldn't change any of it.  I think she did the perfect job writing this essay and she just kept grabbing my attention with everything that I've written.  She makes great points of her garden and the divorce.

      This essay caught my attention with the title, but that is about where it ended for me. I found it a little hard to follow and the point escaped me in the beginning. And why was he carrying a bottle of urine? He never did explain that. Or maybe I’m just missing it. ?? 	I did feel sympathetic towards him when he mentioned the ill treatment that he received just because of his disability. I wanted to smack the house manager that kicked him out so rudely.  	But all in all I wasn’t that thrilled with this story. Aside from feeling a little indignant with the author, I wasn’t left with much of an impression with this essay.

      This writer came off to me as being very judgemental and negative, but I realize after reading it a couple of times she was basically stating her thoughts and observations as to how people act. I do agree, everyone does show off in some way or another, but this doesn't make them a bad person at all, it's just how we are, we all just want to be noticed in some way. I like how she states the different kinds of show offs and give examples of them, it creates images for the reader.

      I really liked this essay; it kind of gives the reader a easy-happy feeling. Growing up she was a happy little girl that enjoyed how she lived; it wasn't because of money either, it was because her family worked together and supported eachother, she worked for the things she got, and it was a feeling of accomplishment to her. After reading this essay it didn't make me wish I had more, it made me wish that I had what she did. I have lots of respect for people who work for what they get.

      Chief Seattle uses one major tone though out the essay that he writes on the white man vs. the red man or another term that he uses is his people. The tone that I am refering to is that of a very deep intensived process that his people go through with the white people. Chief Seattle uses many examples of this treatment through out his writing of this essay but the one example of this use of tone that sticks out to me in his writing is "The white man's God cannot love our people or He would protect them." To me this is his way of getting back at the white man for all that we have done to his people. To me it is not the current peoples fault of what are ansestor did or didn't do to the red man or in the case of Chief Seattle his people. It is not like he owns them. In that way he is telling them what to do instead of letting them make up there own oppions on the white man and how we treat them. The major techique that he uses through out this essay is the way that he words things so that when you read it the reader gets the sense that the blame is on the white people if he is of a different background and this inside of it's self can cause problems if you go back in to history. If the reader is of white hertige this essay can make them feel like everything that they have no control on is all there fault when in reality they may have nothing but their heritige to do with it.

      I feel the tone to the "What Me? Showing Off?" essay is obnoxious in most parts and the only humor I found is where she talked of herself showing off with her poems being published and she wanted everyone to know it. The technique I find Viorst using is a lot to do with repetition. There are many examples throughout the essay that explains this. For example, showing off is mentioned throughout the whole essay. Viorst talks also about the different categories of showoffs, which are the competive showoffs as well as the Narcissitic and sympathetic type showoffs. She uses the word exhulting numerous times such as, "Exhulting is what my husband does when he cooks me one of his cheese-and-scallion omelets and pratically does a tap dance as he carries it from the kitchen stove to the table, setting it before me with the purely objective assessment that this may be the greatest omelet ever created." I feel the repition is distracting.

      Mealtimes in my family have been a time when I usually cooked, I was raised by my mother and grew up as a single child. Many times, (especially in the summer) it was my job to cook dinner because my mother would work. We would have to have everything done in time for me to get to hockey practice.I found our meals to be very rushed, if I was to have any dinner around 5:00p.m. or 6:00p.m. at all. Alot of times I would have to wait until after hockey practice to have dinner, and then we usually picked up something from a fast food place.

      Thoughts on “We May Be Brothers”  This essay brought me to two different spots. At the beginning the author led me to believe that he was only pointing out the differences between the two peoples and their ways of life. I was not excited to read on at that point. After continuing to read, I really got sucked in by the way of thinking that this man had about the differences in the two peoples. I really like how it ended by expressing how the two peoples differ in their view of death and how he, the author, believes that his people will always be around even if they are dead. His writing gave me a very ominous feeling.

      Stacy as writer comes out to me as a very loving and appreciative of her past. She tells this essay from a single point of view. She tells us of her past through child like eyes but through an adult voice. She gave these examples through a paragraph like this: “Most nights my dad could finish the milking and catch up to us before we made it past the garden and carry the jug for us, teasing us all the way. By the time we got to the trailer and Dad had washed up, we would have supper on the table and a large, cool glass of milk setting at each place.”

      Collectively our group felt that Chief Seattle spoke in a reserved tone.  Reading his words you see the contrast between Chief Seattle's people, "My people are few" and the Big Chief at Washington's people, "His people are many".  These are statements, facts without emotion, passive.  He uses powerful imagery throughout like, "day and night cannot dwell together".  Even though the title is "We May Be Brothers", by his question "how then can we be brothers?" and all the other differences, I wonder if he was saying here that it would be impossible.

      This essay is about just that clutter. Each day we deal with clutter. Our children, our jobs, our belongings, cars, every day I deal with this clutter. I love how he used clutter in different manners, such as a laborious phrase, language, ponderous euphemism, each time using it to the best of his ability.

      Thoughts on “What, Me? Showing Off?”  This essay drips with truth. The writer uses a sarcastic honest tone in writing this essay. She displays her sarcastic tone and honesty in describing how she herself shows off. “And then there was us, complaining about how tired we are today because we went to work, rushed back to see our son’s school play, shopped at the market and hurried home in order to cook gourmet, and then needlepointed another dining-room chair. And what we are doing is showing off”.  Viorst is also uses humor in her writing. She displays this by titling the different categories of showoffs as competitive showoffs (CSO), narcissistic showoffs (NSO), and insecure showoffs (ISO).  I think that we all know at least one person who could fit in one or more of these categories. More importantly, it makes me wonder which one I would fit into.

      Stacy Jurgens the author of Picnics and milk used a delightful tone throughout her essay. Making sure that the mood is light and carefree coming from a child's eyes is a perfect setting I think. The technique she uses is memories of childhood. And I mean this as she allows you to see this essay through the memories of one child's childhood. A perfect example of this specific technique is this.......  Lunchtime was different then suppertime in that my father did not come back to the house to eat. Instead, he either took a lunch with him or (my favorite) (in other words this was a childhood memory of hers that she can remember) we took a picnic lunch to him. We never knew when these picnics would occur, but sometimes Mom would pull out the old wicker picnic basket and send us girls to the garden for fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. We knew then that we were going to find Dad in the fields.  This was to me what seems to be a perfect memory for a child to recollect when they see a picnic basket, or tomotoes and cucumbers. I for one know this for sure I have had a lot of childhood memories and this girl sure knows what a memory can mean by the looks of particular objects or places.

      I don't know if anyone will even come here anymore, but I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. This was the first (and probably the last) class that I genuinely looked forward to coming to. And not just because I love to write, everyone was so nice, too. So thanks for the good memories. See ya around,  Bethany

      Many years ago I had a girlfriend that was the love of my life. I thought that we would always be together no matter what. This girlfriend and I had a relationship for five years and we were very committed to one another.  Eventually, I ended up taking a job in St. Paul and because of this I was forced to move. Our relationship continued for many months after, but it was very hard. We only got to see each other on the weekends so we always made the most of it. We would go shopping and out to eat all the time. On many of these ocassions I purchased things  for my new apartment. I still have many of them to this day.  One such purchase was a hollowed out clay cowboy boot, my girlfriend helped me find the right fake flower arrangement to put inside. I still think of her everytime I look at it. I can still picture her arranging the flowers.

      I feel that capital punishment is a way of families seeking revenge on an assailant. I feel this way because of my christian beliefs. It says in the Ten Commandments that to kill is a sin, and that this sin is punishable by eternal damnation in hell. I do believe this, but I also believe that families do deserve some redemption.  I would have to say that killing someone, for their satisfaction is wrong no matter who pushes the switch. I would sooner have a criminal that deserve such a sentence be left to rot in a labor prision. Atleast this way society could profit from their work and they would have no hope of ever getting out.

      The human race can be so cruel. People are criticised and rejected because they may be different or not normal. When you see a person that may have special needs, or maybe they talk differently, we tend to tune them out and not acnowlege them. I see people all the time doing this because i work with a child that has mental dissabilities. THis child also has a hard time in social experiences. When she meets new people she tends to latch on to them and thinks that everyone is her best friend. SHe doesn't see the looks that some people make at her. I hope that never changes. She doesn't need to see them at her age. she does not know how to discriminate. She will play with those older than her and those younger than her. I wish that no one could make someone feel differently. We are all the same and we are all different. WHat makes the difference is how we treat others and how we treat our selves. When a person cannot respect their own self then there is no way that they can care about or even respect another person. When i was about 13 years old, I was teased and ridiculed. I always was the but of anyones jokes, and was not really liked be anyone. I had a very good friend though that has kept me from continuing this disrespect. They taught me that the people that had made fun of me jsut felt insecure about themselves so they teased me to make themselves feel better. I hopethat someday this child that i take care of can see that it is not right to make fun of someone else jsut because they are unhappy with their lives. I hope that maybe people will be able to see her for the sweet, caring, and talented young lady that she is becoming and not discriminater against her. John Hockenberry's Essay "Limited Seating on Broadway" stated it best. " It is the forum and agent for chalenging America's hardend perceptions about race, politics, class, gender, religion and more recently AIDS and homophobia." All of these people are are all different from us but they are also the same. We need to remember that.

      The author, Deb Sullivan in her essay, IN THE GARDEN, quotes, "I realize I want to do for Jake and Ben as I do for the plants in my garden. I want to plant them in my world and tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life." Having three children of my own, I understand how Deb Sullivan wants to protect her twin nephews. This is what I want for my children, to protect them. Deb Sullivan quotes, "Their parents, my brother and his wife of fourteen years, divorced. Certainly not a new phenomenon, but I had no idea the change and tremendous pain that divorce can bring." Myself, having been married ten years with two beautiful girls found I had not prepared for this terrible feeling of being depressed. I fell into a deep slump and could not understand how my soon-to-be exhusband did not even put up a fight for these two children. Little did I know there was someone else involved or I was in denial with him being involved with someone twelve years younger than him. I was divorced within two months! Talk about a fast divorce. I wrapped alot of myself worth in my husband so my depression was deep, to the point of suicidal thoughts. I had an onion on the counter when the girls would walk in and see my cry. I would tell them it is the onion making tears in my eyes. This was in my apartment that I moved into that I could not stand living in. I joined a B.E. group. This is Beginning Experience for divorced, widowed and separated. This group helped me tremendously. I had no sense of direction when I got divorced. Where do I go now? What direction is my life heading in? What a Change! I no longer could work due to my depression. I had a hard time socializing and tryed various medications that did not work. I ended up in the hospital for taking Prozac that totally went against me. My thyroid was off and my blood pressure went up. I was seeing snakes and just was not a good thing. I moved out of the apartment and bought a trailer house that made me feel better because I actually got more rest and was able to do part-time work with hallmark cards in the Ben Franklin and Pamida store in Roseau, Mn. Later, I added another part-time job doing jewelry. This was in the fall and I started going to Al-Anon meetings that helped me a lot. After one year, I decided to move back close to my hometown which is Gonvick, Mn. I live four miles from there in a town called, Clearbrook, MN. Little did I know, I would be adding a new member to my family. A little boy, born in May of two-thousand one. What a surprise to my life he was. I love him dearly and he is now three years old. My house is small for the four of us but we manage to make it work for us. I have done a lot of painting and rearranging to make for a cozy home. This is where I feel I am doing something for my family. I am back in school and not isolating myself from society. I am once again trying to venture out into this world to make something of myself, not just for me but for my children. This is where all my hard work lies. Within my kids. They are my reason for life, for living, for being here. At one time in my life, for quite a while I did not know that this is what held me together. They're my pride and joy and I would do anything to give them the world. I do the best to give them what I can and that is the best I can do. Deb Sullivan, in her essay connects this with planting in the garden and relating it to life with nurturing and caring for her garden in the way she does the same for her twin nephews by praying for the seeds of love to flourish in their life. I hope this works for my children too. I pray everynight for God to watch over them and keep them safe, especially when they are not in my care when they go with their Dad's and I have no control but to put them in Gods' tender loving care. I don't like being apart from my children but with divorce, there is no choice. What is going to happen will and I hope that they always come home safe.

      First, I would like you to turn in your first Springboard essay before you leave.  Remember to turn in the second tomorrow.  That will be your final essay.  If I can grade all of your first Springboards before class tomorrow, I will give you time at the end of class to revise your second Springboard.  I would like one more thing from you. I would like you to write about your writing this term. I would like you to look over your essays and note any pattern errors that you have. Pattern errors are those that happen repeatedly, not just once. Then, I would like you to note any kind of problems you have had content-wise. Mostly, though, I would like you to talk about how your writing has evolved over the term. How has your sense of essay changed? What do you do better now? What essays illustrate that change? These are just a few of the questions that you can ask yourself, but if you want to focus on some other aspect of writing, do so.  This will be a sort of last prompt to bring together what we have done.   Type it in word and bring it to class tomorrow night, our final class.  Then choose your best essay to read to the class tomorrow night.  This will be our "Final" celebration.

      When I married my husband, I knew that both he and his father were trappers, hunters and fisherman. I was never exposed to these activities as a child because I was raised as a “city kid”. The fishing I have come to enjoy and I can deal with the hunting as long as I don’t have to carry a gun, but the trapping is another story. I can certainly relate with the author of “The Coon Hunt” as she described how she felt when she was expected to kill something for the first time. She stated, “Oh no! I am going to have to kill a raccoon! How am I supposed to tell Dad that I can’t kill anything?” My heart broke for her. Her family was forcing her to except something she did not believe in. I didn’t have to think about hunting, fishing and trapping much until our children started to get old enough to be interested in these activities. I encouraged their love of fishing and when they were old enough, even hunting as long as they hunted with respect for the animals. But somehow, I could never understand why they had to be part of the whole trapping experience. To trap an animal and let it suffer until you return the next day, or even a couple of days later, is deplorable to me. I knew that it was not just my decision, so my husband and I compromised. The kids could accompany him when he was setting traps, but I did not want them to go along when he was actually collecting his catch or skinning or fleshing them in order to be sold. For awhile, this compromise worked nicely until grandpa got involved. One day grandma and grandpa (my husband’s parents), were babysitting our children. When we returned home and pulled into their driveway, I was shocked at what I saw. Grandpa had been out in his “trapping garage” taking care of his catch for the day. He had to skin and flesh the hides of the animals that he had trapped, in order to prepare them to be sold. He decided that our boys could accompany him to watch. I guess one thing led to another and when we pulled in the driveway, they had a beaver’s intestines stretched from one end of the yard to another. Needless to say, I was appalled! Somehow, what they were doing was so disrespectful and disgusting to me. Lives should be cherished even if they are only an animal’s life. When I got out of the car and asked what on earth they were doing? Both of our boys simply replied, “We wanted to see how long they are.” I was speechless. I asked my husband to please get the boys ready to go and I headed into the house to collect their things. Once we returned home, I sat the boys down and explained how I felt about what they were doing and why. They had only been following their grandfather’s lead and were too young to understand that what they were doing was wrong, as far as I was concerned. I explained to them that even though something is dead, we still need to respect their remains. I later discussed my feelings with my father-in-law. He could not understand how I felt, but agreed to make sure that the boys would never partake in something so gruesome again. In exchange, I agreed that when they were older enough, they could make their own decision as to whether they were interested in trapping. I appreciated the respect he showed for my feelings. Interestingly enough, neither one of our boys ever became truly interested in trapping as they grew up. Was it because I felt so strongly about what had happened that day? Was it the compromise my husband and I had reached? Or was it because they too, felt that trapping was an inhumane sport to participate in?

      Bethany Salmonson Composition 1-SBEssay 2 Julie Lundblad August 2004                                                 A World of Words             I walk along the rows of books. My arm reaches out and my hand brushes across the spines. I feel the textured smoothness underneath my fingers and I take in a deep breath. I see the letters, I see the titles, but I don’t concentrate on the words. My mind is content to be numb in the familiar environment. I don’t need to think in this place. I know the path to take and I know the curves and pointed edges. Every turn is dear to me. I smell the musty scent of old books. I pick up a well used book with a brown cover. It is a classic and has been read many times over by many people. Here it lies, one copy of a great masterpiece and it lies now forgotten in storage. I take it home with me. I admire the ripped binding and torn cover. This book almost tells two stories. The one that the author composed and the unwritten story that is lying in its outward appearance. I stop to wonder how many hands have held this book, how many people have opened it’s cover.

      Deborah Tannen once wrote, "When people have arguments in private life, they're not trying to understand what the other person is saying. They're listening for weaknesses in logic to leap on, points they can distort to make the other look bad. We all do this when we're angry." In her essay "The Triumph of the Yell"  I feel this paragraph especially relates to my life. The biggest fights Tim and I had were always over money. One night we were discussing the disbursements of the money and where it needs to go, when I reminded him the importance of dates. This sparked a fude.
