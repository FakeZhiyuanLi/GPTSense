      Ya know how no matter how good you have it, you always dream and wish for more?  Well, that is what I was thinking about today.  I woke up this morning and everything seems brighter, happier, more full of life.  For the first ten mins.  Then Grouchy bear Joe woke up, and in came the storm clouds.  I dunno what is with that man and waking up.  But that is beside the point, anyhoo..  So Joe wakes up in a rotten mood.  I even told him, "don't be cranky this mornin" And yet, the storm rumbled underneath.  Joe gets up and gets dressed, and somehow, someway, it ended up in a snappy argument. To which, my day became a rainy dreary day and I crawled back into bed tryin to keep the rain from fallin from my eyes.  Just as Grouchy Bear was about to leave, he comes back in and kisses me like nothing had happened.  But I was just not having any of it.  My mood was rotten and my day only 1/2 hour old, was ruined. So as I lay there in bed, and pout, I thought about how even tho I am much happier in my life at this point, I still have my rainbow dreams and penny wishes.  Why is it that I can't be content with things just as they are? Which brings me to a my topic.  Rainbow dreams and penny wishes, as you may or may not know, rainbow dreams and penny wishes are they things you wish for.  But not the outrageous "I wanna be a supermodel with tons of men swooning over me and have all the money in the world to get anything and anyone I want" type things.  These are penny wishes,  the things you wish for when you toss a penny in a well for. Those small things to make your life just a little better than it is now. So, you ask, what could a 27 year old that is having the best part of her life right now, wish for.  Well... here ya go... My Rainbow dreams, and penny wishes... I wish that I had a life filled with more happiness than sadness. I wish that *I* was the World  to ONE person. I wish that I could have more self confidence. I wish that I was as pretty on the out side as I feel on the inside. I wish that I could be the happy go lucky gal that I used to be. I wish that I could find something that Joe would do with me on a regular basis. I wish that Joe and I could make love more than we argue. I wish that I was sexually attractive. and finally I wish I could be happier.  So there ya have it.  My penny wihes that someday I hope to make come true.  I know that a lot of those wishes are things that eventually I can change and make happen. And some of those things are never gonna happen.  But they are my rainbow dreams and penny wishes.

      Well, as I type this Joe, is currantly in the tub with the cat.  I know it sounds bad, but it's not.  It's just time for the cats bath.   While I sat here I began to think, "ya know I wish I was that cat"  Which Prompted me to write this blog...  Here are the reasons why I am jealous of my Cat...  Loki,is a snobby cat.  He only comes to you when HE wants to.  HOWEVER, that doesn't stop almost any human from wanting to pet him.  The harder they try, the more people try to get his attention and affection.  This makes me jealous because when was the last time someone would crawl under the bed, over the desk, and into a box  just to get to touch me?? Secondly, ALL this cats needs are met.  He gets food, water, love, extra treats, and almost any time we go to the store, he gets a new something, anything from a 100 dollar cat litter box, to a 1.00 toy. Last time *I* got something extra from the store, was a necklace and earings because I NEEDED them to go with a dress for a wedding. Not that I'm complaining about the necklace and earings mind you.  But well.. you girls know what I mean.   Third, and this REALLY gets me.  Joe will finally catch the cat and then proceed to spend the next hour and a half loving on him and telling him what a good kitty he is and all that mushy stuff.  Last time *I* got something like that.... *hmmm* well.. it's been a while Prolly about two weeks ago.  Yet the cat gets this treatment everyday.  PFFT!! :P In my next life, I hope to reincarnate as a spoiled rotten house cat!!

      HI! And welcome to my blog. You prolly stumbled across this page and are now wondering "when do we get to the good stuff" well before we get there, I have a few warnings I need to put out before I dive in.  First... I don't care who you are or why you are reading my blog.  If I cared, I wouldn't be posting it on my personal webpage, nor on the internet. Second... remember that this is my personal feelings and my personal life. You don't have to agree with me, but respect that this is my blog. Lastly... I'm a girl, and with that, I am entitled and expected to have things like over emotional outbursts, over analyzing, moodiness, bitchiness, and in general losing my mind now and then.  So I beg your forgiveness ahead of time.  NOW......... as they say..... on to the good stuff..  I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, USA. December 4th 1976. As my mother likes to tell me, it snowed that day. And, it has snowed where ever I have lived on that day ever since.  When I was still little, we moved back to Colorado where my mom's family was from.  My parents divorced soon after I was born due to the fact that my bio father was a drug addicted freak of nature. I grew up in a crap ass town of Pueblo. I had a strange childhood, I had a step father, that I can hardly remember other than a few bits and pieces here and there.  And from what I can remember, I am thankful to the heavens that I only remember those few bits and pieces. Someday maybe a shrink will find the keys to unlock all the mysteries of that part of my life.   So there we were my brother James, my mother and me. Three of us, tryin to survive. My mother went to school while James and I did.  We were really proud of her, however, that also led to us kids raising ourselves, as well as being raised by our Gramma.   Now Gramma is a whole nother chapter for my shrink to have fun with, but lets just say that Gramma has a way of using the guilt factor to a T. But for all that, Gramma sure did a hell of a lot to keep us kids out of trouble.   Also, thrown into the mix there was my cousin michelle, just three years younger than me, but my best friend and rival all the same. Fast forward to middle school.. those lovely days of hormones and first kisses.  MAN! how times have changed, just the other day I saw a girl who was 14 and pregnant!  When *I* was 14 I was just bursting with joy cause I got my first kiss.  But I digress, Middle school was filled with lots of camping, marching band, dance classes, and Church. By the time I was in High School, I was a well rounded, fun loving and care free gal.  At least on the outside.  My home life was none too good.  I couldn't stand my over bearing mother, I hated the rules, I hated just about everything, eventually I ended up living with my gramma.  Things worked out pretty good while I was living with her.  I ended up moving out on my own, and every now and then I would end up back at Gramma's.  I owned a horse and took care of three others during my time in High School.  Which I am bursting with pride about even in this day.    During my Senior Year of High School, I dated the most wonderful guy. We were gonna get married, he even bought me the ring and everything.  Graduation was a blast and soon College started.  I did not know what I wanted to do in life.. so I floated around and accomplished nothing.  Then one New years eve... my world fell apart.  That wonderful guy dumped me flat on my ass.  However, we did stay 'friends with benefits' for almost a year after that.  We are still good friends to this day ( minus the benefits part) and I harbor no hurt feelings, it was just time for us to go our seperate ways.  So back to the point, In my daze of trying to put my life back together, I moved out to michigan, got in trouble, got married, and got divorced in all of less than three years.   Now here is a good part... I moved back home to Colorado and MOVE IN WITH MY MOTHER!!  Actually, it wasn't too terrible.  I got back on my feet, got a job working for the state mentally institute and fell in love, or at least I thought I did.... Moved in with him, got married due to the fact that I was prego and feelin the pressure of certain peoples parents... *grumble*  well a year and a half plus three miscarriages later... I finally realized that I was stuck in a relationship that was going nowhere and where there was NO love, NO romance, NO excitement, and No joy.  Unhappy and miserable, I left and filed for divorce.  *WHEW* Which brings us to the present, I am currantly dating a fantastic guy named Joe.  Now, for as long as I have known Joe, he has been a life saver and an itch I needed to scratch. However, due to life circumstances, we remained dualy friends and rivals.  Until one night sitting on the computer feeling sorry for the horrid state of affairs my life was in.  MY life suddenly changed, overnight, it was like it had been raining all the days of my life, and now here was the sun.  Joe in a very uncharacteristic moment, spilled his heart out to me and from then on, we have been together..  We are now living together in Denver.  We are happy together.  Although we have our moments.  I finally know what love is.  I am working at the OTHER state hospital in denver, and getting ready to go to school in august to finish my nursing BSN.  *DEEP BREATH* and there ya have it folks, my prologue is complete, and you know as much about my past as I want you to know.  However little bits o info will show up here and there I am sure.  But for now, I have wasted an hour and a half setting this thing up and typing the prologue.  (and to think I am at work and I still am gonna get PAID HAHAHAH) WEll.. that's it for now.

      So, things are a bit strange and sureal around here these days.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but Ever since I've decided to start puttin more focus on myself and my needs and wants, things around here have seemed pretty good.  Now, I know you are all wondering if I have started to become a self absorbed snob, well let me calm those fears right now.  No.  I am not becoming a snob,  I still want to make sure others are happy around me, but now, its more of a Make sure they are happy, but not to the point, I myself, am unhappy.  So this is week three of my new diet and exercise program, I've lost six pounds already.  I still am not down a size in clothing yet, but, at least I am seeing some progress.  Its strange tho, I feel pretty good in the fact that I am taking better care of myself, but at the same time, I kinda feel phoney.  Like, it's not the real me, but someone I wish I was.  I talked to the Health Instructor on the phone the other day and she said that, Yes, that kinda of feeling does tend to happen when you are making lifestyle changes.  She also said eventually, things will become so routine that I'll stop feeling phoney,and it will just be habit.  That is what a lifestyle change is.  So that made me feel better.:)  Well, I guess I should close now, Joe will be home soon. And, ya know, I'm starting to feel like I did when we first got together.  All twidderpatted at the idea of seeing him.  I really really do love him. And, I've finally decided, someday, I'll marry him if he asks me to.  Ta-Ta

      So yesterday was just 'one of those days'.  I dunno what is was, Joe says I woke up in a bad mood, but I didn't.  I think I just developed a bad mood over the course of the day.  I didn't sleep well for one thing, and on top of it all, I was just pissy at myself for not getting up and doin some exercises.  Anyway, Between my 'bad mood' and the fact that I was very hungy and we still needed to go shopping for a grill, I was in no mood for anything. ANYHOO...  So there we were at the store, and Joe was lookin at grills, now I have no idea if a grill is a good one or a bad one, so I just stood there lettin Joe get which ever one he thought was best.  He picked one out and decided to call his dad so we could put the grill in the truck (I think it was more of a "hey dad, is this one a good grill" type thing  but I didn't mind, I think his Dad has a world of wisdom on his shoulders) So.. his dad shows up and we get the grill.  Joe comment that he thought his dad was thinking that getting a grill was Joe's right of passage.  Now, I totally agree with that thought.  In fact, I even made the comment, that Joe and I were really becoming 'domesticated'. Now for some reason, Joe thought this was a foolish comment, and said "what?  You don't want the grill?"  I just sighed and rolled my eyes.  The thing is, I was tryin to say how I was proud that we are even able to get a grill.  How I was feeling really good, that Joe and I as a couple, we actually living life, instead of just surviving. Anyhoo.. my happy thought was broken.  So the next thing you know, Joe was apparently joking when he was making fun of me spending 140.00 in a week. But I took it really hard and felt like I was a complete idiot.  I should have just let it roll off my back, but instead, I said "can I do anything right?" to which he replied "apparently not".  Well, now instead of just being in a bad mood, I was PISSED.  All I kept thinking was "fuck you and fuck this and why the hell do I even put up with this bullshit".  But I kept my mouth shut and just was pissy.  So then, my pissiness rubbed off on Joe, and suddenly he is speeding through the streets like a crazed maniac. I have to tell you, this was the first time I was ever really scared of Joe.  I really thought he was gonna kill someone. I mean, I was REALLY REALLY freaked out.  Specially when the propane take flew around the back seat and just about busted the back door of the car. Joe got out of the car and slammed things around and all I could do was sit in the car.  I was afraid if I tried to get out I was gonna faint. I'm tellin ya I was out of my mind scared.  Anyhoo.. between moments of pissiness, Joe and I eventually got dinner all fixed and there was a bit less tension in the air.  After dinner, I had planned to go for a walk, but I just got lazy and mad at myself for being lazy, so I just went to sleep.  I know it doesn't make sense. *shrug*  So, I get to work and got all my work done, and then went and did EXTRA work and walked for about a half hour and I felt a little better. All the while thinking "I should still be mad at Joe, for god sake the man was a lunatic.  But after a while I got to thinking, (more rationally) Why do I let the things he says bother me? Well, for one, I'm very much in love with him and want to know that he approves of me.  I want to KNOW that he thinks I am smart, or pretty, or hell just anything positive.  Now, I know that a lot of you would say "Shit, Beck, the way he fawns over you all the time why are you NOT happy?"  But see the thing is, as much as he does those things and I love them.  I mean REALLY love them, it makes the dagger hurt that much more when he makes me feel stupid.  SO... I start thinking, ya know, I always tell my patients, people will make you feel stupid, or bad, ONLY WHEN YOU LET THEM.  In fact, One of the patients even made a poster that says that.  So as I am walking around work still fuming, I look at the poster, and WHAM.  It hits me like a ton of bricks.  Why do I care, if he thinks that low of me, then that is HIS problem, if he is gonna be nasty, then that is his right.  I am NOT gonna let it get me down.  I'm headed back to the living part of life.  I've hidden in my little hole for too long.  This is my life.  I'm taking back control of it.  I've led so much of my life letting other people have too much control.  Not anymore.   So of course, this moment of clarity, put me in much brighter moods, and soon I was buzzin around work humming my favorite 'pick me up' song  "Don't rain on my parade".    Don't tell me not to fly I've simply got to If someone takes a spill It's me and not you Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade  Don't tell me not to leave Just sit and putter Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade  I'll march my band out I'll beat my drum And if I'm fanned out Your turn at bat, sir At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir I guess I didn't make it  But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection A freckle on the nose of life's complexion A Cinderella or a shine apple of an eye I gotta fly once I gotta try once Only can die once, right, sir? Ooh, life is juicy Juicy and you see I gotta have my bite, sir  Get ready for me love 'Cause I'm a "comer" I simply gotta march My heart's a drummer Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade  Yes, sir No, sir I'm gonna live and live now Get what I want, I know how All that the law will allow One roll for the whole shebang One throw that bell will go clang Though I'm alone I'm a gang Eye on the target and wham One shot, one gun shot and bam  Hey, world, here I am... Get ready for me life, 'cause I'm a "comer" I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer Nobody, no, nobody, is gonna rain on my parade!     So yeah, starting today, it's ALL ABOUT BECKA.

      So this week, Joe will be in Kansas at a trade (wholesaler) show. Which means it is just me and my kitty.  I survived my first day by working, watching tv, and sleeping.  BORING!  Tomorrow, I will go to the store to get some groceries, do some swimming, and maybe do a good two mile walk.  (MAYBE) I gotta fit some sleeping in there somewhere tho cause I gotta work again tomorrow night.    It is strange how working graveyard really throws off yer life. but maybe if I go right home and sleep, then I will have the evening to do a lot of other things.  I think I will try that tomorrow and see how it goes.  Right how, at 2:30 inna morning, all I can think of is sleep.  I'm sooo sleepy. maybe I can catch some zzz's here in a quick power cat nap of 15 mins. (hope I don't get caught!!!)

      Okay so, apparently my triglycerides are really REALLY high. my cholesterol is boarding on the high end, and I'm overweight. This makes for a heart attack in the making.  SUCK CITY! So my doctor has signed me up for this wonderful program.  Basicly you get a health educator and a dietician that call you on the phone once a week and help you to 'reprogram' your life.   I guess since I really do wanna lose weight and be more active, this is finally a good reason. So right now, I am doing this begining thing. I have to write down what I eat and when I eat it and how hungry I am when I do eat.  Plus I have to wear a pedometer to track how many steps I take every day.  I found a really good website off of the programs suggested websites that is pretty cool.  it's called fit day  urlLink   I find it pretty useful.  Anyhoo.. so now I have begun my journey toward a happier and healthier me. Plus, I gotta say, I've really begun to realize just how much I eat and how much I don't exercise.   To be honest with myself, I really don't eat all that much, but I also don't exercise either. My goal for the month tho.. is fast food only two- three times per week.  Let me tell ya it's kinda hard cause that means having to go to the grocery store to buy food.  BLECK. I did get to buy some new pots and pans tho.  Which made me happy.  So my first meal I made was spaghetti with meat sauce, steamed carrots, salad, and jello.  *yummy*  I think I will be doin jello a lot it is good and not too bad for ya if you get the sugar free kind.   SO yes, ladies and gents, I'm on my way......

      okay, again, I am starting to wonder about joe and his 'deal' with his ex-wife.&nbsp; I am begining to get that feeling that there is more going on between the two of them than Joe is letting me know.&nbsp; It bothers me to all ends that she only messages him on days and times that I am at work.&nbsp; She did it the whole time he was in Atlanta. So last night, at about 11:15pm (on a day I was supposed to be at work) Joe and I were in bed almost asleep, and his instant messager went off.&nbsp; It was driving me crazy, I was thinking that it was Jen messaging him.&nbsp; I was going nuts because I wanted to know and yet I didn't want to know.&nbsp; Well, eventually I got up and just had to check... I know it was wrong of me to do that, but I just HAD to know.&nbsp; SO I check, and guess what??&nbsp; It WASN'T Jen! I felt like total and complete shit that I had thought it was Jen. And I sat there and wondered, why is it that I am feeling so insecure? Joe has been nothing but wonderful to me.&nbsp; He's been almost the perfect boyfriend since he came back from Atlanta. Anyhoo, so I am wondering, am I just being needlessly worried, or is my intuition knowing somewhere deep inside that there is something more going on.&nbsp; *UGH* I hate feeling this way.&nbsp; Now I know you would say to me, why don't you just ask Joe.&nbsp; Well, here is the deal.&nbsp; IF&nbsp; I were to ask Joe, it could cause big problems between him and I.&nbsp; And things are going so well right now that I don't want to do that.&nbsp; IF he IS hiding the fact that he is still talkin to Jen, I am gonna be pissed off and seriously hurt.&nbsp; I don't know if I could take the hurt.&nbsp; IF he ISN'T still talkin to her, and I bring it up, then he will be hurt and angry that I can't leave the past in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I really know is that I am confused.&nbsp; and it's driving me crazy that she ONLY messages him on days and times that I am supposed to be at work.&nbsp; It's just&nbsp; a bit too convienent. and suspecious.

      So, here it has been a great month for me.&nbsp; I've finally starting losing weight, I feel good about myself, and I am almost totally out of my depression. Life is looking good for me. &nbsp; And wouldn't ya know it,  &nbsp; Joe's being a moody bitch.&nbsp; Ya know it kinda sucks,&nbsp; I try EVERYTHING I can to cheer him up or make him happy, and it just doesn't work.&nbsp; It's frustrating, but I guess I'll let him retreat and be the moody bitch for a while.&nbsp; I guess he deserves to be that way&nbsp; his work life is stressing him out, and since his work life is tied into his family life, I guess he deserves to be pissy since it really is a stressful time for him.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It just sucks cause here I am wanting to be fun and playful and he is just moody and bitchy and complaining. &nbsp; WAIT... *sigh* Now I guess I know what Joe felt like when *I* was moody and bitchy and complaining.&nbsp; KARMA POLICE getting me back.... &nbsp; &nbsp; But what can I do to bring us both back to being playful and happy???

      So, it has been exactly a month since I have written on this blog. I can't really say I have been too busy to update, but lets just say I've had so much going on that I needed some time to think, regroup, and center myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, now that I am in a better state of mind, let me tell ya about the past month.  &nbsp;  At the end of last month I went to see a Reproductive Endocronologist, this doc was sooo nice to me.&nbsp; He really gave me a lot of info on the PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) He explained to me in terms that I could fully understand, how my weight&nbsp; gain and other health maladies that I have been suffering are not my lazy ass fault.&nbsp; Instead, he explained to me that for some reason, my body has become insulin resistant and that has led to the PCOS (or possibly caused by the PCOS the jury is still out on that hehe) as well as the high triglycerides and all them other maladies my poor body is suffering.&nbsp; He started me on Metformin and over the past month I have lost a total of 12 pounds.&nbsp; I'm still tryin to get used to the metformin. Between nausea, diarrhea, and heartburn I'm sure that I will be losing more pounds as I can hardly manage to stomach the food that I *HAVE* to eat, let alone anything that is bad for me!!  &nbsp;  So, Joe has been a complete and total sweetheart. I can't really explain what happened, but I like it! :)&nbsp; I haven't felt this good about myself, or my relationship with him in a very long time.&nbsp; Today, Joe came home from work early and made the comment that he wanted to spend some quality time with me.&nbsp; Now, I had not had any sleep all day, but by god, I was not gonna give up quality time with Joe just to sleep!&nbsp; So, we went to a movie and then grabbed some taco bell ( in the drive thru joe mentioned that this weekend he would take me somewhere nice I guess he was feelin bad about taco bell, but let me tell ya, food just isn't my cup of tea lately so I didn't care&nbsp; but it still made me feel good that he was thinking about it) anyhoo.. so we grabbed taco bell, and then he said&nbsp; "well, what do you wanna do for the rest of the night?"&nbsp; I was thinking that the night was pretty much over and I could sleep, but before I could say that, he suggested we rent a movie from blockbuster.&nbsp; Well, of course I agreed! Watching a movie with Joe beats out sleep anyday! So we rented the butterfly effect and sat on the couch and cuddled.&nbsp; Man talk about WONDERFUL!!!! I've been sitting here with a cheesy grin on my face all night long!&nbsp; All my co-workers keep tellin me "gross, yer in LO0O0O0ve"&nbsp; I just giggle and say "thanks!"  &nbsp;  So, except for&nbsp; a few minor set backs, like my ex being an ass, trouble with my car, and failing entrance exams for college, I've still managed to maintain a good outlook on life.&nbsp; And, short of a MAJOR CATASTROPHE, I'm on cloud nine and I plan to stay there for a while.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Soo... off I go.... back to work with my head in the clouds and my feet planted firmly on the ground.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Well here I sit, at work, bored bored bored.  I've done everything I was supposed to do and a little bit extra.  And it is only 2:45 am.  I'm gonna be here until 8:30 am!!!! UGH!   Anyhoo..  A lot has been goin on the past few weeks.  I've enrolled in school FINALLY! :) YAY.  School starts the 30th.  I am taking Anatomy and Phys, Chemistry, and Psychology.  Not too shabby a work load since I haven't been in school in a few years.   I am really really looking forward to this.  So I went out and registered for school, got everything all settled, I only have two very important things to do before school starts, #1 PAY FOR SCHOOL, and get my reimbursement from work.  and #2 BUY BOOKS.  Buy Books?!?!  My god, those things are outrageous, I sure hope I can find some used ones for sell.   Anyhoo.. Joe is so fantastic.  He is really being supportative about me going back to school.  (but more on him later) So, yes, I am really gonna be a school girl again. GO ME!  (and hopefully I can keep my grades up and still keep a grip on my mind as well *hehe*)  Next thing that has been fairly big, is the fact that Joe and I are moving into a bigger and nicer apartment.  It's a one bedroom with a den.  I'm really excited about it.  Finally, I'll be about to get out of the apartment complex that has been nice, but it was 'cursed' for me from  the day I signed my lease when Joe says to me "yeah Jen and I lived there before" *UGH* so now that we are moving into these new apts, hopefully Joe and I will have soley our OWN memories of our apartment.  Yes my friends, it has been a busy few weeks, and it is bound to get busier as the days go on. So I must leave you now as we have a new admission that needs admitted.  I will write more about Joe when I return again.  But for now Ta-ta
