      Hullo, all! I had a very fun day yesterday. My friends Monte and Becky went to Laser Quest with me! 'Twas very spiffy, since I hadn't seen Becky in about 2 weeks and I don't usually have the oppertunity to hang out with Monte due to his unsurpressable fear of being taunted for having female friends. Monte drove over to my house (almost missed it because he was distracted by Krissy's house, and I'll explian why in another entry]. Then he got to meet my dad. And I showed him my room and a picture of Krissy-chan I have on my wall. Dad summoned us to the car, and so began our carpool to Becky's house and to Laser Quest. I think Monte and my dad hit it off pretty well. I was pleased. I always like it when my dad approves of my friends, and you can always tell when his goodbyes include, "you're welcome to come over anytime." Which has only been gifted to three of my closest friends Erica (the estranged friend), Becky (the horsey friend), Bri (the elijah-loving friend), and one more, which makes four, Monte (the Krissy-obssessed friend). Wow,. I am  so  rambling.... Anyway, back to Laser Quest! We all got our codenames for the game of 17 players, I was Culiica (of course), Becky was Snickers (after her dog), and Monte was Gopo (or Gobo, depending on the Marshal's spelling ability). lol I felt really old in the first game because all the other people there consisted of rabid elemetry schoolers. I swear, they were foaming at the mouth! Well, the kicked our asses during the first game... Well, at least mine. lol Even with using Monte as a shield and shooting him for extra points, I still placed as 8th. His goal was to get last place in the lowest negative number. lol Becky and I were trying to work together, one in front one in back, it worked for a while until we got shot... Then we lost eachother and ended up accidentally shooting one another... =^.^=;; Well, in the games to come we each inproved, or in Monte's case de-proved. lol Well, we had lots of fun and hopefully will all get a chance to hang out together again. =^_^=

      Broken Echo Productions.... Doesn't that have a nice little ring to it? I'm going to ask Bri if she thinks it's a suitable name for our film group. Echo is a mountain nymph from Greek Mythology, she was so in love with Narcissus, who was momentarily intruiged by her, but fled when he found how much she loved him. Here's a exert from a website I found: "And so when Echo came upon Narcissus one morning as the youth was struggling with a deer he had just nettled, she could only gaze and not speak. And gaze is what she did. Even among the deathless gods, she had never seen his like... she moved her lips in vain. "Narcissus sensed her eyes upon him. 'Who's there?' he called. "'There,' called Echo who could only repeat what was last spoken to her. "'Let me see you,' said the boy. "'See you,' said Echo. "Momentarily intruiged, Narcissus then shouted, 'What are you called?' "'You called,' the nymph replied. Then, unable to contain her ador, she burst from her cover, hot and panting, onto the beautiful youth. Not unused to such behavior, Narcissus quickly freed himself from her embrace and fled posthaste deeper into the forsest, leaving his nets. "Echo followed after, trying to call out to calm his fears, disarm him, but no sounds came. The youth soon disappeared from her sight. For weeks the nymph wandered the forest in search of her beloved, sleeping little, and eating nothing. She became so thin that before long there was nothing left of her at all that an eye could discern. To this day she wanders the mountains the world over, still looking for Narcissus. The rocky canyons and the deep valleys are her home. One can call out to her, and if she is home, she will answer but only with the words first spoken to her." -  urlLink http://www.androphile.org/preview/Library/Mythology/Greek/Narcissus/narcissus.htm  "It is Echo's voice that lives on in quiet places, the voice that, from far away, answers others' words." That will be the motto of our film-making group. Isn't that.. such a sad story, like one everyone could understand in their own respective extremes?

      Novacaine comes in many shapes and forms. Sometimes needles, gas, or even the occacional gym sock. Basicly, novacaine is anything that makes you feel smart and look dumb. From my experiance today in the dentist's chair today, no matter how many enjections he gives you, whether it be 1, 2, or 8, like he gave me, when he pulls out those plyers, you know that you and your teeth are in for some serious shit. I remember thinking while being overcome by the urge to hit my dear, dear dentist (which I tried), that this could, possibly be some sort of philosophical experience; like coming of age... by force. Or maybe it's like puberty for teeth... As I continued to enhale the gas, I peacefully pondered these burning questions while studying that little embroidered horsey on the nice dentist-man's shirt. It was rather pretty, wasn't it? So... so.... thready... YANK! What the hell?! Why is this weird guy with plyers trying to disconnect me from my teeth? I closed my eyes so I didn't have to watch him as he adjusted the plyers to get at a better angle at my last (of four) teeth. I had this odd vision of him accidentally pulling out my whole lower jaw and me becoming the next girl on Extreme Makeovers... Well, finally my pre-braces-teeth-removing ordeal was over. But, along with a mouthfull of gause, I was left with an immobile mouth and a etched expression of surprise on my face. I decided that it'd be fun to stare at people from the car window with my "stoned look" and dry blood on my cheeks. It was rather entertaining.

       ... you're grandma interferes with your love life.   Oh, wait! Or, should I say, non-existant  love life. I suppose I  should  be happy. I'm 15, nice (usually), and I have great friends. But, it still kinda sux when your grandma calls you up to tell you about the boy accross the street that seems "smitten" with me. =T.T= God! I must be approaching this whole boyfriend thing wrong. My first (and only) boyfriend, my dad royally hated, and I was banned from. We were together for eight months. And I'll tell you one thing; those eight months could be classified as the best and worst of my life! Anyway, he ended up being an ass (that I still care about). He slept with his ex and when I dumped him and he got a new bitch, he tried to cheat on her with me! What kind of slut does he think I am? Anyway, since him, I've been looking for male companionship. .. And I've learned only one thing; guys like hard to get. Each guy that's asked me out on dates and shit like that, I've always been a complete sexist bitch. Why? I just don't take stupidity well. And frankly, most guys are kinda dense. *Sigh* Most of my friends have boytoys and will call be up to tell me about how they have  so  much fun with them. I appreciate that my friends value my friendship enough to tell me about their spit-swapping (I'm such a hypocrite) but, I'd appreciate it  so  much more if I had someone to share the joys of knowing  exactly  what your boyfriend just ate. Well, adios for now. And everyone please remember that mints are much appreciated in the world of dating.

      Hello all you bored people who are actually reading this. I really have no reason for making a blog, except for my own entertainment or embarassment, depending on what I write. I've had public blogs in the past and quit writing in them because all of my friends and "friends" had access to them, which made it hard to write anything worth writing in them. So, I've made this one for two reasons: my friend, Becky wanted me to get one so that I could comment on hers and because she'll be the only one to know about it. Maybe I'll finally be able to write something worthwhile, something actually important in my life instead of censoring everything I write. So, beware! The keys are alive.
