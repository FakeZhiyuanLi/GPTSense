      hello blog,how are ya today?was working yesterday,and was planning to go to the cinema on my lonesome afterwards,but mike insisted on going too because he thought the idea of someone going on their own was stupid . . . its the cinema,why would you want to go with other people when you arent actually gonna talk to them?!then dandering about the town afterwards we encountered a drunken luke, a drunken gary, a drunken robb and nicola and lynsey(dunno if they were drunk) so luke and gary tagged along too.luke went out with 10quid,and now he has 11quid,after getting loads of drink, going to the cinema and getting loads of ridiculously priced cinema food . . . i think in his drunkeness he mightve performed aural sex on gary for money,he cant quite remember . . . saw shaun of the dead again, not as good second time round,but still good.oh, and it was robbs birthday,and i completely forgot about it,thats what he gets for being a dick : P oooh,on thursday i was all happy because i got 2 letters in the post, TWO LETTERS!!!!!!!wow,i felt so grown up and mature and great and stuff : P and then i opened one of them and it was getting my birth certificate back from my drivers license thingy,so i was all happy cause i felt even more grown up cause im getting a drivers license!hooray for mark!and then just as i was all happy and stuff i opened the next one . . . an appointment with a cardiologist in newry hospital for an echocardiograph(what?!) : | a real anti-climax to my letter opening adventures.the stupid people in the doctors told me i was all ok and stuff the day before, and then i get that,so maybe im gonna die after all.my pains have sort of gone down anyway,so it could just be growning pains(on the heart?).blah blah,ill be fine.  http://pub208.ezboard.com/ffastfude31550fastfudenewsboard.showMessage?topicID=13676.topic  i was just told about this,the arcade in belfast burnt down.thats the place with rip-off clothing and darkstorm records.Biggy also owned a spice shop in there and a practice hall with loads of equipment in it.oh, and a pet shop . . . poor wee animals.sucks.

      Guess what,i was up early today!It's 12o'clock now, and i've been up for about and hour and a half!im not usually up for another hour or two!hmmm,hopefully im gonna get lots of work done today.bah,dad wants me to cut the lawn,no chance of that happening though. im in a crappyish mood today,because its so nice outside,and im gonna be stuck inside all day working.i just wanna start walking again,but im gonna resist the urges.hmmm,not much to report really,im boreded.im just in one fo those moods that im always in,as if somethings eating me up inside and i cant figure out what it is(although most of the times i do know what it is,im just ignoring it).sucks.

      hmmm,easter still sucks,although not as much,because i sorted things out with suzanne (even though there wasnt anything to sort of,i was just being a dick)  which made me a lot happier.still miss her though. i did work yesterday!a whole day of pure hardcore unadulterated work!(?)im very happy with myself because of it, and last night me and john d rented a game out (XIII) and went to his house and played it.oh yes,gary came too . . . ok,i quite like the guy now,although that is very likely to change the next time he talks to me aboput how drunk he got or how stoned he got or how many girls he's "had" and are "demons in the sack,nba", but for last night he was ok.except, we got a two player game out, and with gary there was 3 of us,yes, i am very selfish when it comes to games : P oh, and XIII has the best sniper rifle in any shoot-em-up ive ever played . . . *ahem*  the night before(tuesday night?) i just stayed in on my own and watched black hawk down,i didnt wanna go out or do anything.before these holidays id almost forgotten how good staying in on your own,or with one of two friends and just watching a movie/playing a game etc etc,i havent been able to do that since ive been working at tescos,because i get so few weekend nights off i always feel that i NEED to go out and do something,so it wont be a wasted,even though i probably would have less fun than i would staying in . . . im just stupid.  gonna do more work today!ive also got to work at tescos tonight, even though they said they would give me thursday night off,but i dont think they are now,methinks they just said that they say theyre gonna give me it off just to keep me happy,but they arent really,so im gonna threaten to quit tonight,which would make me very happy,because then i could revise loads more for exams and still have more free time.who needs money?!

      Taken for granted?feels like it.hmmm,easter sucks, ive said it before and ive said it again.i really wish suzanne would just sort out her problem with david,throw the guy away or something.her being so depressed is really eating at me and it pisses me off as do a lot of other things so im generally a very pissed off guy at the minute.i cant even do school work because everytime i sit down i start to think of something that pisses me off.  hmm, suzanne i miss you and i dont care if you dont miss me because you "dont miss people" even though you've told me you miss me lots of times before.yes,im probably really unfair and being a bastard and stuff because she's going through a hard time,but its just annoying that she keeps on letting david hurt her,even though she was saying about how she got annoyed about david keeping on letting his girl(naomi?) hurting him.things definately arent like they were when we first met and started going out, and the sad thing is that was only a few weeks ago.i blame easter.  ive decided ive nothing against john d because of staurday night,but i still dont want to talk to robb.john wants me to go to the cinema with him and robb tonight,but i think ill just pass because i couldnt be assed with him.the thing is he doesnt even know im pissed off with him.i should make my feelings more clear to people from now on methinks.i stored anger and frustration and stuff way too much.  my parents are all annoying me today because they are my parents,and they know me too well so know im pissed off at something,but they keep trying to cheer me up,and theyre just so bloody annoying about it! hmm,lets see,who else is pissing me off . . . i think thats it,but im generally pissed off at everybody today, and yesterday.hmm,all of the holidays actually.  aarons been real cool though,i like him, and im sort of trusting him now,which is a good thing.hopefully im going to his house tonight,i think he could cheer me up, and if he doesnt then movies will.  *screams and roars randomness at the top of his voice*  i dont think i wanna come onto the internet anymore this week,i might update my blog or listen to music,but this thing is just too depressing now,im in a really big movie mood for some reason,probably because i found where my bro stashed all of the dvds. : )

      its 2:40am, and i dont really wanna sleep a wink.im drowning my phantom sorrows by replacing them with tiredness.somethings been eating at me all easter, and i dont really have a clue what it is yet,grr,its annoying me. hmm, so today i did a few more questions on the same test paper i started last week,but then the annoyance came back, so i just did a forest gump,and just started walking.i picked a random country road, kept to it, and 3 hours later i was in a chip shop in dromore having my tea . . . i was pretty lucky,because the last bus home nearly drove past me,i had to run after it a bit :P a taxi home wouldve cost about 10quid more.hmm,coincidently,i met rusty on the back roads of dromore,so he gave me a lift and recommended the chip shop.i was able to recommend a few fields that i passed by a few miles back for him and his friends to drink their carryout in. watched triple x tonight,i liked it,but then again i like most movies.movies are like people,you just need to ignore their bad sides and try and find their good sides.hmm, no, you dont ignore their bad sides, you realise them,so you know they are there, and then you just dont care about them.so far in my life its been a good philosophy,ive got some friends who everyone told me not to go near,and im happy that i did.vin diesels such a bad actor tho, but he has attitude, and i like that.pitch black is one of my favourite movies, just for riddicks coolness in it :P sequeal(prequel?) soon,should be a good dose of un-thought provoking mindless action for moi.

      I have just come to a very grand conclusion . . . easter sucks. the day, the holiday, everything. if i was in school i think id have less work to do,because id actually do it in school,whereas at home i just couldnt be bothhered,its not that theres too many distractions,im just lazy.today was a crappy day,i was all bummed out after last night,and i just wnated to sleep today because i didnt want to face the cruel evil world, but being a good catholic i had to go to mass.bleh.i walked to lukes tho for our annual game of timesplitters 2,bringing my ps2, only to find it wouldnt work on any of lukes tv's, so we had to walk back to my house again,which i dont really mind cus i like walking. i confronted my mum today about her being narrow minded,and i told her pretty much everything.when i started drinking,what drugs all my friends do,how most young people dont give a damn about christianity and especially not catholicism.she seemed to take it pretty well actually,so hopefully she'll get a wee bit less  . . . conservative? last night at jd's sucked.they had a "brilliant" joke lined up for whenever i came in that robb got a blow job of some wee slutty girl in the hangout(we call her king whore).i didnt believe it at first,but then jd and gary both agreed with it, and i thought luke did(which i later found out he didnt),so i believed it,and was quite pissed off with robb for it ("i have as much faith in two timing as i do in the catholic religion" - Blain).for a start i wouldnt put it past robb to do it, so i believed that much,and also when four of your best friends all tell you something's true you believe it, because of a thing called TRUST.it really annoyed me that they took it so far, wth robb being a dirty bastard and describing it all in detail,and john d telling me how he walked up and saw it.i have the best friends ever(sarcasm).another reason i believed it was because luke looked really pissed off,and i thought it was because he was pissed off with robb too, but it turns out that he was pissed off at robb,gary and jd for lieing and stuff.when i asked him why he told me it was true he said that he didnt, which is true because when i look back on it he just grunted when i asked him.if they had just said he did, then straight away told me they were messing about, i wouldve been fine about it, its the fact that they all lied for so long about it,which pisses me off,its not something friends do. apart from luke i have no REAL decent friends,he's the only one i trust 100%.sucks.fair enough,the 3 of them were drunk, but it still annoyed me, i wouldnt have put it past them to do it sober.reading all the above you might be thinking im just being whiny about a stupid practical joke, but i dont particularly like it when people get their laughs on other peoples behalfs,mine or anyone elses, and you also had to have been there.luke's pissed off with them about it too,so atleast im not moaning on my own. hmm,i blog in too much detail.

      hmmmm,boredom strikes! . . . so i had a really easy days work today, REALLY easy,there literally wasnt anything to do except look busy,so i took it all at a slow relaxed pace.at one point me and ryan had an argument over who would put the juices out, because we were both so bored we just wanted somethng to do!sad, i know,but somethings its easier to do work than pretend to do it. straight out of work and i phone john d and he says i could go to his house, then his dad pulls up and offers me a lift!coincidence . . . i think not.pretty handy.jd has a free house tonight, so i went home to get a shower and get changed etc, and him,luke,gary and robb went to the pub : P im not really looking forward to going back down,because im all tired and sickly,so i think they might just annoy me witht ehir drunken antics.i shall bring timesplitters 2 down so i can play robb and take advantage of his drunkeness, so he wont beaat me this time : P hmm,no punctuation again, ah well. soo laura rooney openly fancies my dad, and apparently so does half of st patricks upper sixth.all that from saving a dead cat : S its quite scary really,because craic and blain both fancy my mum . . . laura told me that my family should be in OC yesterday,so yes,that includes me because im part of the gene pool!!!(although i got the crappy genes none of my brothers wanted!)oh yes, look at me im beautiful! : P maybe if laura fancies my dad she'll stay away from me from now on . . . hehe,not nice mark. hmmm, oh yes,im boycotting subway. i spend way too much money there,and for some reason it makes me sooo tired after eating one, so im gonna go easy on them for a while.i think ive had one every day the past week,thats a lot of money! anyways,thats my blog for today,dont think i have anything else to say . . . oh yes, easter tommorow, and not one bloody egg,nobody loves me *cries*

      God bless the cinema,it's so cool being exactly where it is and not moving and stuff.I just saw Shaun of the dead and it's a bloody funny cool movie, i quite enjoyed it.Im gonna ponder seeing 51st date tommorow if im bored,ive been told its not a chick flick and its bloody funny, so that sounds good to me : )  hmmm,i was at the hangout tonight,in between tescos and the cinema.the place felt really strange,depressing,but a different kind of depressing than it usually is.i think with the absence of drunken spides and without luke(lukes cool) theres a void that needs to be filled.lets hope luke comes back and the drunken spides all burn in hell shall we?hmmm,i still havent got talking to luke yet, he's going on sunday,but now that ive got monnies on my phone(yeah!) i can send him a farewell message.i liked the guy and asll,but him going wont really affect my life, but i feel so bad for bre, cause luke was her best friend,i dont know if she'll be able to stick the pointlessness of working in the hangout without him.anyways,i shall try and make her decline into a stressed out,northern irish hating american as painless as possible. hehe,killing zombies with old vinyl records,genius,pure genius! ooooh,i sent away for my provisional license today(more than 6months after im 17, but better late than never) so expect mark to be behind the wheel and learning to drive in a few weeks, god help you all : P hmmm,thats about all of my blog i think,dunno about anything else.hmm, oooh,i finally picked my glasses, they are exactly the same as my bros except larger to compensate for my abnormally large head!i like em tho . . . night night,oh and sorry for the lack of punctuation, im too tired.

      hmmm,I've done 3 practice paper questions in the past week . . . guess who's going to be up all night the night before he goes back to school? Sucks, I don't like work.I still think my brain scanning idea is a good idea,which doesnt take into acount laziness or revision or anything, it just takes in potential smartest, so it scans our brains and tells the exam board what grades we would have gotten if we did revise loads and work really hard.It's a pure genius idea, I know.Damn Tesco's. Hmm, this blogspot thing is a great way to waste time.Hmmm, i miss my Suzanne : (

      Mark;s feel good factors:  1. Big glass of cold water and a royal gala apple.  2. Thrice, Thrice and more Thrice, god i love thrice! Playing paper tigers on gutiar repeatedly really releases your anger,tho i broke a few strings in the process :P (" . . .And every time i play with passion i start breaking strings . . ." - Thrice!)  3. Hmmm,i think that's it. It doesn't take much to get me out of a bad mood! :P  Mark's feel even better factors:  1. God to ring me up and tell me i don't need to do my AS levels,because he knows I'm gonna get all A's anyway :P  2. God to ring Suzanne and tell her she doesn't need to do GCSE's anymore,because . . . well,just because :P so then she can come see me in Banbridge and I can go see her and stuff :)  Hmm,ok, these things haven't happened YET, but i'll be sitting beside the phone for the next few weeks just incase . . .

      AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!Mark is in a bad mood.Mark wants to hurt something really bad. *looks about for small annoying squirrels* Hmmm, dont know why but I'm in the worst of the worst of bad moods today, sucks.I seem to be able to find a reason to hate every living thing,so it's not nice.I just wanna crawl up into a ball and die, and to make matters worse, I'm working tonight :'( damn Tesco's. I think i might be pissed off because i had a cup of Horlicks last night before i went to bed,but i still managed to sleep really shitly.I should sue for false advertisement.Got a sore throat too. : ( *moan moan moan*  Did nothing last night except sulk, everybody went to the coach and left me on my lonesome, so i rented out a game which didn't even work. I spent most of my night staring blankly at the computer screen while I was on Msn being a bastard to people.I'll feel bad about that tommorow, but I don't care about it at the minute.Gonna do test papers today,which coupled with the fact that Im working means I'm gauranteed to be an absolute,complete, merciless bastard tonight.I'll probably poison the bananas in work or something.  Bloody hell, I'm such a gimp,I'm the only person that can be this angry and write a blog with proper punctuation.

"the world is fucked,and so am i.Maybe its the other way round i cant seem to decide"  hmmm,i thought listening to therapy? would make me feel better,but they are actually a really angering band,very bastard like lyrics.i like that usually,but now it just mkaes me wanna go out and butcher a lorry full of cute squarrels.Oooooooh, cool bridge in "stop it youre killing me".hmmmm, i wonder what luke's at tonight,he better not be going to the coach la ba like everyone else . . .

      Ok, so this is my first REAL blog,i better get my grammar right incase suzanne reads it :P   hmm,why do i want a blog?because i have the worst memory ever,and last week i got talking to some of my friends(whoopy,ronan and daniel) that i havent had a decent conversation with in ages and they reminded me of loads of cool and fun things that id done that i had completely forgotten about.I was sooooo so so happy then so im gonna write up all my new memories in blog so i can remember them in years to come, and along the way im gonna randomly put it ye olde memories that people remind me about.  so, hmmm hmmm,today i went into town to meet john d and gary,and we just stayed in subway for ages and ages whilst i ate a footlong meatball covered in loads of veggie stuff and with chilli and honesy mustard sauce all over it. mmmmm,sex in a sandwich,thats what i call it.why didnt anyone tell me how lovely meatball was?!i just assumed that they would suck cus they are cheaper(that last line could be the basisof a vietnamese prostitute joke!) . . . i also bought 2 second hand cd's in vital for 5quid each,millencolin-pennybridge pioneers and hell is for heroes-neon handshake,but i left them at john d's :'(   hehe,which reminds me, we were gonna call the band "hell is for fenians" . . . hehehe,trust me,the only catholic in the band to come up with that.oh, and someone else said "funeral for a fenian" hehe,yeh, that sounds better.instead we opt for november dead list,which instead of ripping the piss out of catholisism,its actually stolen out of the catholic church!apparently its blasphemy and really offensive to catholics, so thatll do :P  hmm, suzanne came last night :) i was very happysome,it was a bit of a surprise that she came because her mum wouldnt let her come because she doesnt know me or my family . . . that really annoyed me, cus i couldnt see how she would get to know my family without suzanne actually coming to my house in the first place,but its all worked out well in the end because it seems her dad doesnt give a damn about my family,hooray for un-protective parents!  im maybe going the cinema tonight with aaron,i havent seen him in ages because of him getting kicked out of the band,so im looking forward to it(even if ive already seen all of the good movies in the place,those guys better hurry up and get some new ones or im gonna lose faith in that place!).  Quote of the day: "Sometimes catholic boys think that protestant girls are easy."  hehe,that made me laugh lots,because i dont see what being a catholic(and not a very good one at that) has to do with whether i think a girl is easy or not!im sure i would still think that suzannes easy if she was a catholic or if i was a protestant! :P (im joking!)  hmm,i sure can ramble on :P  me and sean are in the middle of breaking my mums views of the catholic church,she's waaaayyy too traditional the way she thinks about everything, and i think catholicism is to blame!BURN THE CATHOLICS!!! hehe  ok, end of my post, ive talked too much already!i still dont trust this thing, so you mightve noticed that i havent actually talked about any of my deepest darkest thoughts or anything like that,but believe me, i have quite a bit on my mind about stuff at the minute(its probably easy enough to guess what the main issue is).im thinking things will be fine now,but my mind keeps changing with different things and i keep getting paranoid and stuff.dont want it to happen again!you know what im talking about mark :P   erm,goodbye,over and out, asta la vista,or whatever your meant to say when you finish blogging . . .

      hmm, nothing anneurism-causing exciting has happened over the past week,just a bit of revision, and a bit of lazing about.i had a chemistry practical on friday, which was pretty damn easy, and almost fun . . . just imagine going into an exam with loads of concentrated corrosive substances to play with for 2 and a half hours!if id have known it was that long id have brought some food,i got so so so hungry near the end of it . . . friday night after work i went to steve daves 18th birthday party.ok,i dont actually know steve dave, but that makes me a better person because i made the effort to celebrate with him, even though i dont know him, yes? . . . ok, maybe not, but the party sucked, so i got what i deserved.it had free food though, which was nice, and john d was setting himself on fire, which was also nice :P last night i went to see troy a la cinema,and i liked it, even if no one else did.imagine the storyline of the ilyad,together with all the fighting of gladiator, with lots of crappy zoom ins and slow moption shots from low budget martial arts movies.a winning combination methinks.when i walked home afterwards(at about 1am)i took a de-tour because there were spides drinking on the route of my normal way, and it was so cool.the path i took was completely covered in trees and stuff, so it was literally pitch black for about 5 minutes of walking.i kept walking into hedges and stuff!it was fun, i like pitch black,much the same way as i like a good scary movie. today i watched empire strikes back, did some maths revision, and my mum and dad took me to the new pizza place, which was quite really greatly nice!i ate and i ate and i ate some more, and got fat and full and happy. maths exam tommorow, first proper exam.im pretty damn confident about it,i think i know how to do everything that will come up,and if i dont im sure i can work it out given a wee bit of time, so wish me luck blog . . .

      aaahhh!!! i had my first exam yesterday!!!ok, it was a physics practical, which was piss easy, but the fact that the exams have officially started is a scary thought... despite the exam, yesterday was such a fun day!i went up the town afterwards, got a subway(mmm, footlong meatball with extra meatball sauce), dandered about with random friends for a while, then i met up with robb and honj, and then after that met up with luke and blain and played some frisbee.frisbee ist zer gut. cause it was such good weather and all, i decided id get myself a mr frosty to help myself cool down,and on my first lick of it, my lips and my tongue got stuck to it because of the cold!i was running about supervalue trying to get people to help me because it just wasnt going to come off!!!i finally ran to the food bar thing and made hand movements that to me resembled me drinking a glass of water, and after a lot of puzzled(and scared) looks from the lady who was working there, she got me a warn glass of water which i poured all over my face and got the ice lolly loose.ive never tried to laugh so much in my life,except its a bit hard whenever laughing involves ripping my lips off!!!another funny thing is, all my friends and other random people just followed me about laughing, they didnt actually try to help me in the slightest bit!!! :P i guess i probably wouldnt have helped me either,not when it was as funny as it was!anyway, thats pretty much my yesterday, it was good cause it was so sunny, and im completely solar powered.spring is definately dead and buried,because i got a wee bit of sun burn :\ definately summer time.anyways, maths exam on monday,so today im going to do loads of test papers, followed by a helping of star wars.fun fun fun!

      this friday i went to pete from toilet street's 18th birthday party, after what was probably the worst night of work ive ever had.i didnt actually go to the party straight away, i met up with fiona,suzanne becca and helen who had abandoned ship and just randomly dandered up the town.it was good to see them all, i hadnt seen fiona since that night at the reservoir, and becca and helen since they came to banbridge with suzanne to see me. whenever i did actually go to the party i apparently just missed a stripper that petes mum and dad hired for him.it wouldve been funny to see methinks.then, to my surprise, the dangerfields, who i last saw supporting therapy? and ffaf played :| not that i actually thought they were any good in the first place,its just a bit of a decline to go from supporting those 2 bands to playing infront of 15 people in a crappy bar in a crappy town! last night me, jd, gary and luke went for a walk in the countryside and got chased by horses, which was pretty damn cool!they all decided itd be fun to go up to the fort and drink beer, so i tagged along to make sure they didnt impale themselves on any daisies in their drunkeness(its been known to happen). today i revised a good bit,then luke,ryan and currie came over for band practice.it was pretty damn cool because we set all our stuff up outside,so it gave us lots of running and jumping space!plus, because i live right beside the golf club, all the old golf guys were complaining to my bro who was working in the club house behind the bar. success!!! just watched romeo must die,an ok movie.acting was a bit lame, and there wasnt even that much fighting scenes in it, but sure,it entertained me.now, however, i am very tired, and shall have to depart from my interweb excursions to slumber for approximately 10 hours. night y'all!

Over and out.

      hello blog,guess what?me and suzanne broke up today, woooo! :| ok, not really the best thing thats happened to me,but sure, ill get over it.im actually quite happy believe it or not.why?well, although i liked her it pissed me off that we didnt see each other, and it always seemed to me that she never made any effort,which i really didnt like.now its just something that i dont have to worry about, especially because the exams are coming up, its a great big load of my back.thinking about it, that might not be why im happy.i think i might just be happy because i actually properly talked to her on the phone today for the first time ever(and first time actually talking in ages), so i might just be happy because of that,which covers up my pissed off-ness for us breaking up . . . only time will tell, i guess ill find out tommorow.whyd we break up?well i got really pissed off with her this week because of certain stuff, and i asked if she actually liked me, and she told me that in the past few days, she didnt(not as a boyfriend anyway).it actually surprised me that it was the past few days, and not the past month . . . :\ so i guess she broke up with me,which i dont mind, im not one of those people who care about being the one who breaks up with their girlfriends/boyfriends, so meh.it means ill be able to bitch about it for the next few years : P ironic that after almost 2 months of going out, she never phoned me once, and now that we broke up she's told me she'll phone me . . . very odd indeed.stuff like that about her that pissed me off, but all in all im pretty sure i still like her,its just we never really got a chance because of her coursework,me working in tescos and the exams coming up. . .just makes me wonder what if id met her half a year ago instead of 2 months ago . . . hmm, enough of my suzanne based ramblings,apart from that i watched pulp fiction today, a bloody great movie,but thats about it. . . damn sundays.

      hello blog, long time no typed to.hmmm,im wondering should i do a quick re-cap?yes, i think i will.. . . in the past 2-3 weeks ive dragged some extremely beaten up and bloodied guy out of a fight(more like a beating) while baird from the hangout held them all off.wasnt nice at all,nope.i got finally managed to get thursdays off work,after weeks and weeks of bitching,and just in time because i was going to quit that week if they hadnt given me it off.oooh, and i saw funeral for a friend and therapy? c'est tres bien.funeral for a friend rocked, definately the best performance from them ive seen.therapy? on the other hand were a wee bit under par,nowhere near as good as the alternative ulster release gig thing in my opinion.i recorded a version off screamager off radio 6, and there's quite a lot of cock ups in it, not too great for a professional band such as therapy?,especially since its a piss easy song to play.hmmm, i cant think of anything else that ive done,which is annoying, because im pretty sure ive done a lot more than that,but thats what i get for not updating.stupid mark^. hmmm,last night on the way home from work i got followed by a couple of spides,who shouted at me that i was "lucky" that i turned down a road that they werent walking through, even though they were literally 3-4 metres from me for about half a mile . . . im sure if they had the balls to jump me they would have long before.not that im particularly scary or anything, its just that they are obviously pussy assed retards . . . hmmm, john d rescued me tonight from myself, brought me to the cinema to see van helsing, and he got me in for free!for free!!!god i love that guy, and god i love that cinema!van helsing was a great no-brainer,i think i actually got stupider just by watching it.good action and stuff,and thats about it :P i liked it,i also liked underworld too though, which everybody else seemed to hate . . . i dont think its possible for me to not like a movie.the only movie that i thought were crap in its entirety was jeepers creepers 2,but i liked it for the comedy value of its shittyness :P thats me all blogged out, talk to you soon . . . :

      lo blog, how are you today . . . ? . . . hmmm, fine, dont reply.bastard.well im fine, although im up bright and early (about 10.30, early for a saturday!) to go to work, for 9 hours! 9 hours of work, god, this should be fun :| im going to aarons 18th birthday "social gathering" afterwards, which im loking forward to, i just hope im not all tired and stuff.only thing is, i need to get him a pressie!im thinking i might just go into town now and look for one, because ive got nothing better to do . . . i might get him a dvd and some cake, that seems good enough to me.just thinking about it, i might just let him of with some of that money he owes me!not very birthday pressie like, although thats what my mum and dad did for my 17th birthday, which sort of sucked.  not much has happened over the past 2 weeks, although mum and dad went away to scotland last weekend, so i had a few peeps up for a wee gathering.not much at it happened,although it was pretty good because it didnt have that "lets get fucking blocked la ba" party mentality, it was just plain old talking and stuff,well, mostly.even luke and aaron talked a bit!!!amazing!a lot of people went home earlyish, mostly because of mike craven being a dick.he's such a dead on guy sober, but when he's drunk he is an absolute wanker.he didnt leave till about 3am . . . when he left me and luke went for a wee hiking trip, so we didnt actually sleep on saturday, which sort of affected me all week.twas nice though, we got to see the sun rise and got chased by bulls, how poetic :P  my dad came back home on sunday, but my mum is still in scotland!a week and a half without mum in a house full of boys is pretty bad as you can imagine.things are pretty smelly around here!i think im under-nourished . . . things got so bad i actually cooked the dinner last night!Me!Mark Doran!cooks dinner for his family!?!?scary, isnt it?  everything else in between the last blog was just me procrastinating.i really havent done that much revision yeet, which annoys me a lot, although now that the maths exams are out of the way im definately going to start hardcore revision tommorow!oh, i did maths mechanics on thursday,it was quite hard but i think i did well in it . . . next exam is chemistry this thursdays, should be fun . . .

      So I've been in canada for over a week so far, and am now in port dover, with my second host family.  The rest of last week was pretty cool,I mainly just went site seeing and did touristy stuff etc etc. The highlight was this jet boat ride that took us up the Niagara River through some rapids, and me and Derek decided it'd be fun to sit at the very front of the boat, the front right actually, which just happened to take the full brunt of most of the water. There was a lot of water. It was cool and in a very distressing/scared-shitless painfull way, so I enjoyed it.  Derek went away to Vienna on the Lions Exchange thing on Friday, so I just hung about with his friends for a bit, and went to the beach on Saturday with them all, and got very randonmly sunburnt in little patches about my body, which wasn't(and still isn't) nice. Then I went to a wedding on Saturday night . . . :\ It wasn't fun because I was about the only one below 40 years old, and because I was feeling all tired and shit and stuff because of staying out in the sun all day. On Sunday I swapped over host families, and when we went to the Potluck at Dunville me and Jim sat down at a table with two random guys, and started talking.The Canadian of the two guys(one was Canadian, the other from Denmark) asked me where abouts in Ireland I was from, and when I said Banbridge, he told me he knows someone from Banbridge, Kerry Shields, who I also know (not personally though,but I know her sister . . .). Pretty damn strange, it really is a small world! Also, on the jet boat thing, and old Canadian guy started telling me that he was Irish, just like every other person in Canada I'd met had, but he actually knew Banbridge, and was able to rhyme of all the small crappy villages and other towns surrounding it, so I'm guessing he has more reason to say he's Irish than most, even though he sounds Canadian, ay? Anyway, now I'm with the Synkowskies(spelling?) and they are cool.It's a different experience from the Voices, because Port Dover is a wee small town compared to big Niagara City, and also because I have a lot more freedom to go walk-a-bouts and stuff, and they actualy let me help out around the house a bit, so I don't feel completely useless!!! Anyway, that's all I could be bothered writing, I could go into a helluva lot more detail, but whats the point, no-ones actually going to read this anyway!!!

      Yay!Exams are long finished(well,a week ago, but it seems a lot longer), and I am currently writing this blog from the Voice's house in Niagara Falls!!! This place is great, I'm a very big fan of Canada at the minute : P(booo America). Because the city is the biggest tourist city in the world(joint with Paris I was told), there is a lot to do as you can imagine! The actual Niagara Falls is great, you really dont appreciate how large it is until you stand right beside it (or behind it as I did yesterday). Its one of those things me being me would goand stare at everyday for a very long time. Then there are casinos and arcades and museums and shops and cinemas and other touristy style stuff, very nice indeed. I saw Spiderman 2 last night too!!! . . . It actually sort of sucked . . . It was a good movie, but it didnt' really live up to the Spiderman legacy. Canadians talk pretty much the same as Americans, except they say "aboot" instead of about, and they throw in "eh" at the end of every sentence, just like a Northern Irish spide says "like".Everything is written in English AND French, because of all the Quebec people, so I'm relearning all my GCSE knowledge in the morning times by reading cereal boxes! Everybody here is Irish or Scottish or English, nobodies Canadian :S On Sunday night some guy told me he was Scottish, English and Irish, so I told him you could tell by his accent.I dont think he likes me very much anymore . . . :P Anyway, I could go on and on and on, and on a wee bit more, but I'm not gonna, because I dont wanna sitin front of this computer for any longer 'cause it's such a class day outside!!!Talk to you later!
