      Its our orientation Day 2, tml's the final day and it includes Engineering Maths lesson -_-'"...anyway i was hoping for it to happen as soon as possible..the orientation is boring even though the OGLs(Orientation Group Leaders) did their best to entertain us =D... What's the meaning of my World of Friends? well, my Class ME0408 includes around 14 people, 2 of which came from China,1 from India,Malaysia,Myanmar and Vietnam..imagine that! the most fortunate is we are able to communicate with English(except for the China boy and girl) they can speak english n read english, but they talk to us with Chinese, i dun mind cos i noe wad they are talking about as my experience in my previous workplace had the majority who came from China, but what about the other students who came from india etc. etc? i guess they will never understand their Mandarin including English(their way of speaking english is very primitive n their pronnounciation of the words are "~~~~" not solid enough =D... Still they have my respect and all... Im no racist,Anti-China or anything.... so that's about my story of making a World of Friends... w00t...Poly Life.. hmmMmMm...
