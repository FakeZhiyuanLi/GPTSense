      hi  hm i dun think we need to worry about credebility here. homes are always very enthu about having pple to come and entertain their residents. plus we'll be having the name 'Raffles Junior College' u know.  Hey i've got tons of christmas carols. um mostly are a capella (thanks to nelson) but still its poss to arrange for strings and voice too! tho that leaves a lot of strings and a few voices. haha. a little preview of wad i have. and there are more. -Joy to the World -Oh Holy Night (John Rutter or Nelson Arrangement also have.) -What Sweeter Music -Special Moments -To Everything there is a season (is this a carol?) -forgot the title but it goes  When Christmas comes all christians sing to hear the news the angels bring  -Venite Adoramus the real latin one. not the one we hear all the time.  um there's more. jus slipped my mind.  oh actually jingle bell is fine, if u get the good one that incorporates beethoven 5th inside as well. haha.   yupz yupz. oh we mus start getting more pple to read here and such. =o)   ah i miss singing...   -Chee

       I propose that we use this space to discuss stuff. this way people will be forced to check this space and at the same time we won't be clogging up people's emails! aha.    &nbsp;  well looks like the topic is now carolling. wonderful. CHRISTMAS! one of the problems: what are we going to be known as? we shouldn't go as RJ MEP cause it means extra responsibility and stuff and probably lots of troublesome things like getting approval and whatnot. but then if we just go and be known as A Bunch of Enthusiastic Music Students Who Would Like to Entertain You This Festive Season you must admit there's not much credibility. they'd be super dubious about our standard and there's nothing they can check against to be assured that the performance isn't going to be total crap. so how?    &nbsp;  another thing pointed out in the mails: where? actually i think looking for hotels is a bit ambitious. are we still trying to include CIP into this? then we can carol at homes? otherwise carolling for family and friends is really fun too.    &nbsp;  ah yes and if you need someone to arrange stuff for strings/voices i can help.    lets do have yourself a merry christmas! O HOLY NIGHT! i'll be home for christmas! DECKTHEHALLS! one request: NO jingle bells.

       this sounds like someone we know.     &nbsp;  During a dinner party held in his honor one evening, Sergei Rachmaninoff mentioned that he believed the Grieg piano concerto to be the greatest ever composed. His host, Arthur Rubinstein, remarked that he had, coincidentally, just recorded it. When Rachmaninoff insisted on hearing it post haste, Rubinstein put on a proof of the recording and    Rachmaninoff, over coffee, closed his eyes and quietly listened...     &nbsp;  The concerto over, he opened his eyes and offered his opinion: "Piano," he observed, "out of tune."    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  this one is freaky.    &nbsp;  Beethoven's notoriously difficult, groundbreaking Ninth (once called "the hammer that finally killed classicism") was his first symphony in more than a decade. It was also his last. Incredibly, Schubert, Dvorak, and Vaughan Williams (among others) also died after composing a ninth symphony.     Indeed, musicologists joke about a 'ninth symphony syndrome': Mahler, superstitious about his ninth, promptly attempted to complete a tenth - and promptly died. Bruckner, despite numbering his first two symphonies 00 and 0, also died while composing his ninth. And Sibelius? He wisely stopped after his eighth - and went on to live another 33 years.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      hmm... read this quote today:  Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you  may look back and realize they were the big  things.   then i recall such a literature text from sec 2... Sing to the Dawn... there was this thing that Dawan said about small changes lead to big changes like ripples in water... and yes so do the little things! they have the power to change so many other things and cus a great difference.    Enjoy Simple Pleasures   is one of the traits of me as quoted from the personality test from ccal camp. i believe i not only enjoy simple pleasures, i notice simple things in life too! how many people will actually how the trees by the roadside seem to show a mood jus by the way they bend and sway in the wind? how many people take time to look at the cat curled up by the lift and wonder how blissful that is? how many people look at the rats running across their paths and wonder where they are going to, instead of cursing them for scaring everyone?   these little things, little nature things in this artificial world, its them that make my day. i cant face a computer a whole day, but i can sit on the beach looking at the sea forever. its such a noisy world today that we no longer notice the quiet happenings around us... these quiet happenings that let us wait and ponder, stop to think about anything and everything. we mus realli slow down our footsteps...  hmm in the midst of wondering why im still online now... haha...   pondering... -Chee

      hi!  just finished my ccal camp. hmm... had great fun. knew a lot of people, played a lot of games, learnt a lot of things. enjoyed myself also. can say its a very tiring 3 days, and a fun-filled 3 days. i do wonder if anyone will remember what was taught. i will, cus its my nature to do so. haah... the coaches did so much to make sure we learnt and had fun as well. coach jhun, coach joan, coach anna. wad i liked most was the star wars. we realli just had fun being burnt out and such... haha... today was real fun too. esp the games where the coaches tried to pull us apart. D'Best was truly D best! we stayed together and still did not become aggressive. yay!  but today was realli emotional. after 3 gruelling days together, it was sad we had to part briefly. it was fun when everyone was together, and we will all miss that. for all that was here during the camp, i thank you for making this camp wonderful for me. i thank you for being there for everyone else. i thank you, salute you, and wish u all the best in all upcoming events in ur reign as a leader. =o)  Hav fun everyone!  -Chee

      hhi  i must remember today. 23 july.  today is the first time since june i actually was fine. i mean, i was truly happy and had nothing to bother me about. i may still be under stress and the pressure to do well for so many things, but im finally able to control my feelings. keep them under check. finally. after so much thought and talk about not letting my emotions get in the way of doing things, and focus on wad is important, i find that im finally able to put my words into action. maybe not all of it but still... im finally able to leave everything behind. n im finally able to see everything in a clear light. everything is falling into place, everything is so logical now. im no longer angry nor upset at anything nor anyone. it happens that everything has a logical explanation, and it just takes time to see it. and now i'll no longer feel depressed and stupid for all i have done. im glad i did what i did. (oh i feel im repeating myself here. haha) i felt as though i revisited my life. over the past half a year, then another year more. i suddenly see why things happen. things happen for a reason, and most of the time the reason is to help u mature. yupz. im finally able to smile a real smile today, and joke wif everyone sincerly and laugh a hearty laugh today. im glad.  and im glad for everyone else. and everyone else's paths whom im going to cross, i hope to brighten up their days when i see them. and lighten everyone's load (tho my shoulder hurts too. haha) and also give everyone a reason to smile and laugh, and forget all their worries.  i feel like a kid all over again, discovering my happiness. and its just like 2 years back when i got the fated results. and i can say its for the good. gosh. smile everyone. and i promise, everyone who meets me, will get nothing less then a sincere bright smile, and a cheery (or lunatic) hello wave.   =o)   HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!   -Chee

      hhi...  gosh im crumbling under stress...&nbsp;im not afraid to say it, but i cried myself to sleep this afternoon... there were so many things that i had to do yet i could not do... i feel as though i cannot live up to the expectations of others... i find that i like to put up a false front. in front of everyone else, i never show anything less than a smiling face (well most of the time). when i'm tired i'm jumpy. like today. i didn't sleep at all last night. was doing project work stuff. then on the way to school i sort of napped a while when standing in the train. then went to school everytning was like clockwork that's all. everything snapped into place when i was there and there was nothing much i had to do. but i feel pressurized to show more. im underperforming. i realised that when i was checking my marks in class. a peek at others were like AABC, ABBC etc... (sorry to those who were scoring lesser than me, but i naturally want to do much better.) suddenly my ABCD seems so fake, so low. i know i could have done much better, despite what everyone else says. gosh im such a.... argh cant find a word for it. only achievement today... i passed my napfa at last. yay. pushed myself for 2.4 and made it in 13:03... i know its not good but at least i passed. im glad. at least i think i am. my exam is screwed. my schumann is in chaos. my beethoven is in a pile of notes. my programme notes are somewhere there. but not there yet. argh. gosh how can i manage... i dun have the strength to carry on... waaaaaaaa...   crying... traumatised... emotionally unstable...   -Chee

      hhi blog  hmm... must say that i learnt something(s) very important, thanks to what happened over the past 2 months. which maybe only 4 people will know but still... for now, im a student. means i study. and nothing else. no need to worry about other things like work, and even less so affairs of the heart. those can wait. for now, my priority is my studies, and scoring my A's. i was too slack in the past half a year, which led to my heart wandering away, and my mind concentrating on things that are not that important. i was jolted awake (sort of) by what happened, and even though i was quite devastated for some time, i finally see what was the point of that experience. i can say it was a blessing in disguise. ok it will take some time b4 i know how blessed is this blessing, cus things happen too fast and too soon. but i believe its for the better. hey at least i walked out of it alive. haha.   i will alwaes remember them. its an enriching experience... one that has left me sad, and then happy... i've learnt, and grown up as well... matured i would say.  so now. im not going to let my heart lead my brain. and im not going to deal wif things that are not important to a normal, average 17-year-old boy who is still studying. i've been rudely awakened, and i'll never dream again... even though my fantasies are sweet. i'll always rmb them.  a big thank you. =o)   finally thinking straight... -Chee

      hhi blog... heyz maybe i shld give u a name? any suggestions? oh ya u wun reply one... heez... means its me thinking only... heez... i jus thought of a motif today... maybe use it for my first compo... 5-note... simple rhythm, not complicated at all...  ahz, talk about compo... reminds me of school... the weekend's over... a weekend is the only time i hav that i can imagine my life is fine and happy... which in fact is not... im envious of everyone else who can take things so easily. i look like i can, wif my smile all the time, but in actual fact i know im stressed out. i may jus konk out anytime... which isnt a good thing considering my health... after watching the first part of gattaca... im thinking is my life manufactured too?  it does seem quite fake to me... or too real... im experiencing too many things all at once... makes my life complete, but fake? hmmm... im beginning to dread going to school. there isnt much point in going any more. its going to be the same routine day in, day out, nothing new, nothing interesting. i hate this. and school, interacting wif everyone makes my life so real, which i dun like. i dun like the reality. its cruel. nothing goes well for me, it seems. its only me. always. why? why? why?  sometimes i wish i werent around. i want to just be a silent observer... it makes me happy to see everyone happy, without me screwing up everyone's life, and everyone not seeming to notice. i feel like an outsider wherever i go. i never belong anywhere... i can just die and no one will notice at all... grrr... so far no one has proven me wrong yet. its not a good feeling... sometimes i just wish i was alone, where i can let my thoughts wonder to a faraway place, where everyone loves me, and i belong there. but is there such a place in reality? i want to find such a place, but... gosh... that was long... and i havent said everything i want to... but i dun hav time anymore... im going to hav to make the most of my time if im going to live this life fruitfully... seeing that i wun live as long as anyone i know... its not nice knowing u are unhealthy, wif a fatal illness... and there's no cure, and yet doctors fuss over u all the time.. ah blog... i'll give u a name soon...   on medication... that doesnt help...  -Chee

      life's challenges do not aim to paralyse you, they aim to push u on. i believe that now.  i am in denial... i cant believe it... i hav always thought of myself as a positive and upgoing person. but now im hit wif another shocker today. haiz.  i wrote quite a few things down today. personal stuff... dunno if i really want to type it here... but... arh i dunno... im lost and confused... beginning to hate things all around me. don't realli think i felt happy about things since so long ago. real happiness doesnt come easy, i know that now. i... i... just want to live a peaceful life now. simple pleasures, not in search of anything more. gosh i realli need help... im wallowing in self-despair... not looking forward to anything, except having a good sleep. i havent slept in 2 days... been counting the seconds all the way til morning... gosh... i feel so disgusted of myself... im imagining things... dreaming up things that cannot be... that's the fantasy i live in. i want to be in a dream. foreva, where everything goes according to what i want and im such a good guy, such a popular guy. i am a good guy i believe. sometimes i wonder if im too good... heez... got back 4/5 of my common tests liaoz... ABCD... hope the last one's not E... XXOO#@%!#%&#(* ...   dreaming as usual... in a fantasy -Chee

      had a long thought today... i've done so many things in my life, and i cant say i made the right decision or took the right path each time. now that i carefully think through everything, i find that i hav many faults, and then i make a lot of wrong choices, and did a lot of things that i probably should not have done. i may have regretted everyone of them, but i think there's no use jus crying over them. im going to correct myself from now on.  heez this is how my life has been so far... i wun be too specific cus... well no special reason... i remember all the way back to primary school.. in fact... primary 1... im haughty, and stuck up. full stop. P2, still stuck up brat. full stop.  p3, was one of the naughtiest in class i think... was very talkative. i rmb my teacher called my fren's mother and complained about the two of us talking, and she called my mom, n i was caned... haha p4, i rmb cheating during exam. was caught, but in the end lied my way out of it. partly becus im the top student in class and there's realli nothing they want to fault me on. p5, i always lied to go to school earli, jus becus i dun wan to be at home. and i would steal money and spend it jus to be popular... p6, i stole things in school. *woops* and the teachers stil dunno. Sec1, i was quite a stuck up brat as well... didnt realli hav any frens in school... picked up soccer jus to be popular, but ended up as goalie to be shot at.  sec2, did somethings i shouldnt have. and even though i was a bit better off in my choir, i sort of faked my sop voice since the start of the year... and i was a terrible sl. kept screaming at my section... bleahx sec3, made it to trip science. guess i felt ok about it... then i sort of didnt like my class (hey i dun like a lot of pple... haha) and always was for choir choir choir... faked sang thru a whole concert that year... woops was evil right? then end of year there was 2 camps... organised one of them... but now looking back, i was so haughty... and i remember scolding vulgarities a lot...  sec4, found out the truth about my health... i actually became more happy... i was smiling a lot more, and took things a lot more easier. um how to put it, i was involved in something i should hav been. was detrimental to everyone involved. but even though its over now,i lost a good fren, and i still cant get over it... and i became hardworking... and i actually bonded wif my class... wow... and i actually was not at all boastful about my achievements that year... even tho im lik top for maths and music...  J1... this year. i found out ive made a lot more mistakes than other hav made for a lifetime in jus this half a year. ok maybe not mistakes, but just doubtful decisions... firstly was coming to rj. truthfully speaking, i probably would hav enjoyed myself more at hc, nj, aj or even yj. but now that im here im determined to be my best. glad to hav the meppies arnd! 2ndly... i actually joined choir again. hav to say my confidence in singing was actually quite busted aft last year... but i got in, i was thinking, maybe toh is not such a bad guy. truth is, he's not, but i cant make myself belong. i ran for council to get an excuse to quit choir. im quite sure im wrong, but im still determined that the whole choir hates me. oh ya, there's too many soloists there and im like dun lik it.. sorrie... 3rdly.. running for council. even if i got in i would hav died anyway. should hav known my limits. gr... but i'd say campaigning was one of the best times i've had... but maybe i should hav stayed in chorale... 4thly.. quitting choir... but i cant turn back now 5thly, the numerous concerts ive been to... 6thly, helping to set up piano ensem, and having a too high vision of it. but im sure we can be good. 7thly, the uk trip. well firstly is going for it in the first place, missed a lot of things in singapore. next is the things that happen there. bbut overall i can say the trip's fine... though i'd probably be better off w/o it... 8thly, the common tests. im quite sure im screwed.  9thly, being a kaypo and taking on too many stuff i cant do. 10thly, being insensitive and stupid. 11thly... matters of the heart. fullstop.  look jus in this half a year ... wow... and i can say ive quite a lot of enemies. heez...  mus change. i hav 1.5 years left. mus make the best of it. or i'll never survive.   wish me luck.   walking in a wonderland...  -Chee

      gheez... piano ensem concert today again... wad a disaster... sometimes i do wonder why do i even work so hard, to prepare something that no one comes for, and no one even the performers are interested in, and gives priority to. maybe we shld jus close down piano ensem.  how much time is wasted la.  and how much more things i have to do.  DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING BY MYSELF??? AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN WORK???  i wonder. if i just don't do things. will they eventually get done?  realli dont feel like going for piano ensem concerts anymore. shld just scrape them.  damn.   -Chee

      hm. cant believe i finished  Sophie's World  today. mus admit i didnt understand half of it. Micheal Crichton is much easier. oh wells. haven had a chance to reflect. but here's something...   What if we find out that we are but a figment of another's imagination, we are always being watched, we are under someone else's control? Will we try to break out of it? Will we try to escape and try to control our own self? Wait... Will we even know?    I think its safe to say that we dont know anything. Look. How nice and warm we are, in our own comfort zones. who ever wants to give that up? And go to  eternity ? Not me. because we never like to venture into the unknown. (hey look, im someone who doesnt like changes. )    I think that I can safely say that i havent even understood any single thing in that book. Once  Hilde  comes in im lost. Then after that i cannot say that i've read anything. everything just passes by in front of me.  And will i ever make sense of that book? Is it even a story to start with? Why do i have so many "Why's" now in my brain? Why cant i make out any of the whys? hmm...       I believe that im not made to understand it at first glance. Not even at second reading. Nor third.  No. Its not in me to understand it. And im not going to put in effort to.   If im to understand it, i will. in good time. Something about fate or wad? Hm.      suppose i had taken more time?  No... No... I shouldnt think like this.  Well now that i have finished it, What more can i do than to let it go, and focus on other things in life?    Oh before i forget,  Happy National Day!!!   Saw the NDP on TV jus now. Grand. As usual. Ooooh... one day i shall be inside that thing. Not as an audience. Not as an MP (hey im not a politics person haha). What i want is centre stage. Yay. (ok la... dreaming..., as usual) but who is to stop me from that? haha. One fine day. I shall be there. U MARK MY WORDS. ^+^   Oh wells. touched the piano today. My finger's gonna be ok! yay. Then heard my recording from the first time i went to the studio. Ouch. my schumann rushed like what. and so unclear. but surprisingly, thinking back to end of May. Then, i never thought i could play this thing from start to finish. Hey, then, i never even thought of playing this piece at all! Schumann was a romantic ! and im not! haha. Oh wells im hoping to pull this off a few more times. Counting down, 10 more days and i shall never touch this piece again.      OH MY GOSH.  Dance Macabre!!!  No matter what, im going to play the Liszt transcription for promos. yay. its gonna be great i tell you.    (well that's 11 min of my programme settled. the other 9? hmm...)      ah what was i doing today? i havent even finished one set of work! what do i have left:   Vectors assignment   Numerical Method tutorial   Physics ASsignment   Physics Tutorial   Studying for Physics LEcture test   GP Paper 2   Programme Notes   MEP essay   Harmony      WHATTT!!! SO MANY THINGS!!! AND I SPENT TODAY READING! haha...    well take it easy chee hang. no good fretting. start now!  Yar guess that's what i have to do! So tada. Lemme go do prog notes!  yar right. when did u ever be so good and listen to yourself? U r going to end up watching tv today. tonight. and u r going out tmr!   oh ya. tmr im going to my new house! yay. can see everything there. yay. 2 more months and im moving!!! cant wait.  but im moving higher!!!  oh no im scared of that haha. umhm.. yar i guess i'll jus watch tv now. haha. no la. for once i'll be more disciplined.    oh gosh. what s that... split personality? scary. but it helps in helping to scold myself to senses. by looking at myself from an outsider's point of view, im thrown out of my comfort zone. and i'll be able to catch myself when i fall, and pull myself back before i step into a pit. not that i encourage it for everyone. u might go bonkers. haha.  alright. shall stop rambling.  10 days to lr. Happy National Day.   Going crazy...   -Chee

      hm. i started on  Sophie's World  today. wow. cant carry on its too much for my simple mind to bear. look. we are not made to know everything in this world, and to understand philosophy as socrates and plato did. Well, i wonder if they were made to know too. but what i know is, in today's world, no one can afford to sit around and think as much as they do. dotz, no one realli thinks anymore.  But we still think! how much i think everyday... think about this, and that and this and that.    How naive can one get! does anyone realli think (pardon the pun) that thinking about maths and science problems is thinking? no! that's all deduction. like deducting how 1 + 1 = 2. and why waves are sinusoidal. wadeva that is. dotz. no one thinks anymore!   But we still use up time and energy to do all these! isnt it also a form of flexing our mind?   How true! yet immature thoughts. What we do here are jus simple exercises i believe. liken this to a soccer match for eg. u do warmups. for the game. i would say doing all these deducting is called the warmup, and the real game is the real thinking of philosophy and all that. but having said that, i myself am lost. how can that be a warmup?   So we should all stop whatever we are doing? and just think about where we come from, who we are, and where we go to?   Gosh the questions that i come up by myself. Am i having a split personality or what? but still. No we cant stop what we are doing. In today's world, our lives are defined by the constant rushing from task to task, and wondering about trivial things about exams and money and food and such. ok maybe we cant say truely that all those are trivial. but it depends on the individual as well... who is to say that exams are not right?    Isnt it great if we can all stand up to the teacher and say, hey lets not have exams because its trivial. haha.      oh im rambling. i know that im not making any sense. so stupid of me to read philosophy when i myself dun want to understand it. hey look its all in the mind! if i wanted to, i can still understand everything. hey what's so difficult about philosophy? it can be so much simpler than all the maths that im doing now. but no. many of us out here are refusing it. blocking out. why? is it because we know that our brains are too small to understand (  such as the pigeon's brain being too small to understand the things that we humans do?   ) ? or are we just flatly refusing, rejecting it?  is it possible that teachers can force us to read such philosophical writings, so that we can debate about it and such? i hate to think so, but it is possible. though i expect no one to realli understand. cus we never spend enough time on it. hm. all these remind me of a book by Richard Bach that i read before:  The Messiah that wasnt . It talks about how a messiah (read saviour) sees things differently, and we are only as much as our thoughts perceive us to be. we can walk through walls if we want to. we can heal if we want to. we can walk on water, fly in the air, etc etc if we want to. and what limits us?  I . the I's, meaning ourselves. Meaning we are as much as we want to be. true. i believe that. or do i realli? because i still have not tried walking on water. i have not tried walking through walls. am i reali that skeptical as well? am i just like everyone else? ah. Rarely am i hit so hard by a book that i start thinking and reflecting. and i realli havent thought so much these days. read my last post. im wondering a lot of things am i not? am i justified to do all that? am i justified to wonder about what may not happen? is it right for me to do so? do i have such a right? yes and no. I have the right to fantasise about my life, to live in my own little world. i have the right to let my mind wander. but no. i dun have to right to question what is unchangable. or unchangable as i think them to be. ar im not making sense. i jus cant put what i feel down into words. 11 days to my LR. my finger's just getting better. maybe shall not play the piano for 2 more days. im getting scared. i feel detached from this world. i look at things so differently from others i feel. im like, dunno, so different. people may shun me because of taht. do they? i understand things differently from others. how so? um. i cant give any egs right now. but i feel im like a detached observer of this world. i keep seeing myself from outside myself. why? its troubling. becuase i end up regretting every other move that i make. like stepping on that stone. did it hurt my shoe? like clearing my throat when someone's speaking. is he/she going to think that i hate his/her speech? a lot of things that don't occur to a lot of people. but they trouble me. gosh. i need to relax.   troubled   -Chee

      sometimes i do wonder if its worth it losing sleep over things that may not need my worrying. sometimes i do wonder if its the same if i disappear from everything, from this world. sometimes i do wonder if i am that important. sometimes i do wonder if im needed at all. sometimes i do wonder if im that capable. sometimes i do wonder if im realli that great. sometimes i do wonder how different things will be if i jus slack and don't care. sometimes i do wonder if things eventually turn out right because of me, or did it screw up because of me in the first place?  well look. over the past few days i've been losing sleep (or rather not getting any at all) doing project work things and piano ensemble things. project work. i contribute in my own ways, my other members contribute in their own ways. just happens that my own way means doing the report on my own during physics lec, staying up late to type minutes and everything? hey im upset that i cant do less and get the same results. why is it that i have to stay up late every week on the day of pw so that we can keep to schedules and datelines? this is so unfair. and piano ensem. look. who is it that keeps chasing after everyone? who does anything & everything?and who is the one whos always trying hard to keep everything in place, everything properly scheduled? and what happens when i let go a bit? its not that i do not want to let others do the work. but i do wonder. what happens if people don keep to datelines? everyone else seems so slack... and look. today my smile stayed on the whole day, even though im greatly disappointed in the turnout during the concert. and people who don't even come to perform. look, im damn pissed. what is it that didnt work out? and what did i work so hard for? just for other people to blame me for not testing out the laptop on monday? is it my fault that i decide to let others decide that for once? do i have to personally ensure everything? no im not arrowing anyone here, but im jus not pleased with the way things are going. jus look at how slack we all are, how unconcerned we all are. maybe it is not meant to be. look. i just havent been myself since june. maybe im finally crumbling. and i get the feeling that everyone is against me. that no one likes me, and that everyone else is more popular. maybe i don't even need to be around at all. i'll disappear and no one will notice. im sure that's the case. ar even abrsm is against me. send me to wad yucky place for exam. and give yms only for dipAB exams. i hate that.  hate that hate that hate that hate that hate that hate that!  why is it me? me? me ? all me? wad's wrong? did i choose to be here in the first place? who's fault is it? yar everyone's going to tell me to change my attitude, look at things more positively. hey not that i didnt try that. but its not going to work. i've been positive too long that im oblivious to too many things. and want me to change? not so easy. u rarely see me frown in front of people i know. damn it. the only way i can lash out is here.   WHAT DOES THE WORLD HAVE AGAINST ME?   i don't even want to be around anymore. maybe i should jus go away. maybe i shld just die.   -Chee
