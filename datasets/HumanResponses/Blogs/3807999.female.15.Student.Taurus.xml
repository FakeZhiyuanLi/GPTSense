      I wrote some poetry while I was away for the last week, I decided it was worth putting here. I'm not saying I'm the best poet in the world... As usual, it's all pessimistic but then again that's the way I am; oh, and I don't like naming poetry, too hard...  &nbsp; why shall I love but never be loved? why must I know but never be heard? why must I care but am never cared about? why shall I see but never be seen, to look at the world as, truly, an individual, yet never given my individuality? respected my individuality? known about my individuality? why shall my initiative never be given a chance? &nbsp; And why shall the world look, prejudge, close their eyes again, and live their lives blind? &nbsp; 'tis a true mystery &nbsp; &nbsp; -- now the second one... &nbsp; 'Tis the ones who lack, they realise all the possibilities, the joys, the advantages, of owning a gift, talent, of mastering something easily, beautifully, 'Tis the ones who lack, who envy and want, yet who would never misuse, or abuse those things which they would so willingly take &nbsp; 'tis the ones who lack, 'tis the ones who try, put effort into their work, 'tis the ones who admire those gifts, talents, who would use them well, who rightfully deserve them

      Ah, the wonderful word technology. The birth of technology was born when life started using tools instead of just themselves for survival. Man followed, quickly adapting to tools and embracing it like a fish to water. I believe that when man went beyond simple tools and started up agriculture and industry, ah, now that was the great mistake.  Look at the world today. We may be living in the lap of luxury, survival of the fittest not even making sense anymore. Instead it's survival of the stress of behaving well, keeping fit, getting education, a job, a family, a retirement plan! The simplistic life of the wild we forfeited for this? We were fit, healthy, happy and almost stress-free before man created the wheel, the farm, the computer. And even better, there was no world starvation, ecocide, crime, or nucular wars.  I look at the natives of North America and wonder if they would have reached the same fate, even if the Europeans didn't interfere. If they were left alone, would they have evolved past their lifestyles too? I know a bit about their culture and I think that I would have rather lived in a tepee a thousand years ago than lived in a stone manor a thousand years ago. They lived off the land, nothing was wasted, not food, not water, not land, not people, for goodness' sakes. They were happy embracing on who they were, what they did, while on the other side we were always plagued with the words "It's never good enough," or "I hope my cheque* went through."   *check, for you american types.  Another thing. Was there suicide, terrorist attacks, world wars or pollution a thousand years ago where canada would be? Naw, just woods, rivers and peace as far as the eye could see. I know the tribes did war on each other sometimes, but did it affect the groud they battled on? Was the land unsutible for life for four hundred years after? Nope. All the plants grew back next spring. We were adapted to the land. We did not adapt the land to us.  So I am still wondering if it was an advantage, technology. Did it really give us good? In my eyes, it gave us overpopulation, world hunger, political warfare and lazy, obese, diabetic families who feed off our money because they can't be bothered to take care of themselves. But that's just my pessimistic views.  Solieus signing off.

      Evil, as in, hmm... I might need to use "bad" instead, but it seems so understative, if that's a word. Screw it, I'll keep "Evil". It will indicate all people who believe it is completely ok, if not good, to break the law or do things that would otherwise seem unjust or cruel.   Have you ever wondered WHY exactly there are evil people?   But, then again, have you ever wondered why exacty there are good people?   But, beside that point, why do people with a particularly wide evil streak even exist? Balance? Maybe. Maybe you need the positive and the negative to create a balance, a neutral earth, kind of like in electricity, atoms, and life as a whole. But then you have those who are beyond the line who are more than just a little nasty, more than a little crooked, like serial killers, slave traders, or people who enjoy torturing, for example. What is their motive to kill, to hurt? Some inner satisfaction? Obviously, they have no emotion towards killing (any negative emotion, that is) or else they wouldn't be able to do it.   Now, for the other part of my topic, power. Everyone enjoys a little power. A little attention, a little control over others. And leaders of countries (most of the time) enjoy it and embellish in it Most of the time they put it to good use. I'm not talking about your average everyday president or prime minister here. Like in every fantasy novel, there is always the villain or supervillain who hungers for power and will do anything to control the world, or, enslave a village or destroy a city. Lord of the Rings is an excellent example.&nbsp; A life example, hitler, can be said to be a little over the edge.  Now, if I were a hero or saviour in one of those fantasy stories, I'd go right up to the evil mastermind and ask, "So, let us say that you will probably take over this city. In fact, let us believe you have taken over all you can reach with your horde of evil followers. What then? Will you live an evil, dirty, unjust life stealing and fighting endlessly with each other? I certainly wouldn't know what to do with all the land and people because, in such a condition, nobody lives happily. You would probably consume all the available resources at an alarming rate, ending you up in a much less admirable predicament than before you even started this rampage. What then?"   I don't know if that would boggle them or not. But, then again, I am not evil myself. I so wish that everyone, one day of their lives to be able to live, see and think in all the world's different lifestyles(economically, ethnically, good and evil). If we all understood each other, would there really be anything to fight about? Maybe, it might stop racism. Maybe prejudism outright! Even crime! Ah, but then we'll overpopulate the world with good people... what would be the fun in that? It would get quite boring... :P   Solieus, signing off.
