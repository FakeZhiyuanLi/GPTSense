						   I have been thinking lately about the pros and cons of my job and whether or not it is worth it for me to stay there or not. At the present time there are more cons than pros. I have wrote these down and they are as follows:  Cons 1. Don’t feel part of the team. 2. Micromanaged by some people in the office 3. People go over my head and go right to Deb when they should be asking me first, isn’t that what I’m here for? 4. I don’t feel like I’m being used to my full potential, few challenges, nothing to be in charge of, no pride in my job. I’m used to being in a supervisor or management position where there is a lot dependent on me.   5. Some people here treat me like I’m stupid, telling me things I already know constantly. 6. If I am to do the administrative role LET ME DO MY JOB! 7. No communication. 8. People leave me out of the loop when I should be the first to know being in the administration position (ie. hiring, firing, Hannah changing offices, new position open, when supervisors are going to be out of the office, etc) 9. I only get to go out on field projects or lab work if they don’t have anyone else it seems. 10. Don’t feel like I’m making the world a better place by being here in the office copying and binding. 11. No paid holidays, vacation, sick leave or benefits. 12.I have asked for my review several times on my one year anniversary and it’s 3 months past and nothing has happened guess I’ll have to keep bugging them. 13. I’m the lowest of the low here in the office, scum, admin bitch. 14. I’m sitting here rotting while I could be out gaining more archaeological experience.  15. Too damn quiet and boring in the office when a lot of people are in the field working hard and having a good time. 16. I’m stuck in this admin position that prevents me from going out on more field work.  Pros 1. Get to work in the field I like and around archaeologists I like and admire. 2. I love it when I get to go out in the field, I work hard and efficiently, easy to get along with supervisors and fellow crew members. 3. I like surveys, excavations, lab work and graphics and burial removal. 4. Supervisors have complemented on how well I do out in the field. 5. I Iike learning new things like graphics, lab work, and drawing maps out in the field. 6. I’m beginning to like the HR women at the HO more and more. In that tough position that they are in they are respected and feared. 7. Flexibility of work schedule, no set time to get here or leave as long as here for core hours of operation. 8. Hardly ever have to work on weekends. 9. Usually low stress environment unless on a deadline.  Is it wrong for me to feel shitty about my job? Shouldn't I just be happy that I even ahve a job at all like my husband says? Whenever I complain about my job that is his comeback: "Well at least you have a job." Good point. But when you are in a position to be a little choosy can't I complain? I just feel useless like I don't fit in and I'm not helping anyone out by being here. But there are worse places to work. I know, I've been there.

						   I took my dog Ringo to the lake yesterday and it was a blast. I met a friend and her dog from work up there. Ringo had never been off the leash but I tried it and he did great. I have only had him for a year and got him from the pound. They found him wandering on the highway, not neutered. So I don't know his history or anything. So in the past year I got him neutered, took him to obedience class and have been training him on the leash. I have been skeptical to let him off the leash becasue I am was not sure that he would stick around. But we were on a trail where there were no people or other dogs so I let Ringo off the leash and he did really good. I was so proud of my dog. He came everytime he was called (even though some of the times it took a little while) and he got along well with the other dog. My co-worker and I are going to make it a weekly thing and take our dogs to the lake. It was a blast!
