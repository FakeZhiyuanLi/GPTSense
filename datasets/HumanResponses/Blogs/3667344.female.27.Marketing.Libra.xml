      I am starting to really see and respect the work that I perform as a mother to my son...why can't others see raising and taking care of children as a job?  No, we don't get paid for it (we damn well should!) and there's no equipment to use or an office or shop to go to, but taking care of children is definitely a large responsibility! Especially if you choose to exclusively breastfeed...for 10 months...  Does "he" respect me as a mother, as a person he is involved with, and as a woman?!? At this moment, on this day, I truly question if the answer is yes...

      Each day is a new beginning, right?  Well today is definitely a new beginning...The song that best describes what's going on in Patti's "On My Own"  "...this wasn't how it was supposed to end..."

      ...now he's not...unable to type anything without him reaching for the keyboard for his input...  Will I ever be able to do the work that it is that I want to do and raise my child...as he crawls away into the other room...well, this was a short entry...  &nbsp;

      so i'm back from my family vacation and it was alright...i guess the best thing about the whole trip was actually seeing my entire immediate family (divorced parents, my sister and her 2 children, my son and myself) together...family is a blessing and i'm grateful for it...i did get a chance to spend some time on the beach by myself...i'm glad that i called my main home girl who advised me to claim what i needed and that was some time without my son...being on the beach and standing in front of water and talking to god was very refreshing...i asked god to give me clarity with my relationship with "him"  then things got interesting...i got an phone call from "keys" and he expressed to me that it would have been nice if i came to visit him and asked how i would have responded to advances he may have made...after all this time, i really do honor our friendship and would not want to cross any lines that cannot be reversed...plus, i must honor what "he" and i are experiencing now and must give the respect that i ask of him...right?
