      The “9 to 5er” is not just somebody who happens to work from 9-5 every day. Lots of people, like myself, work those hours but do not fit the make-up of the character of the “9 to 5er.”   The mind of the 9 to 5er is trite and monotonous, following direct suit with their external world. They become perpetually more and more detached from reality as their lives become more and more centered around their 9-5 worlds. They are the audience of the world, easily entertained by sitcoms, reality TV, movies, and comedy clubs. “Going to dinner” is actually doing something, and getting drunk on a weeknight means mental and physical weariness throughout the next day.   Basically, even if they are an intelligent being who is aware of their condition, they are spiritually dead. What they do in their days does not excite them or others, and what they do in their nights, generally does not satisfy their need to let go… because it lacks permanence. A weekend is only two days.   Niggaz who look forward to retirement are 9 to 5ers. If you have chosen to do what you love in life, why would you retire from it? Basically, 9 to 5ers are lying. They lie to themselves for peace of mind. They are uninteresting, non-risk taking, conformist pussies who are simply going through the motions of living life. They fill the empty spots but do not make the world a better, worse, or interesting place. While not bad people, they are totally expendable and replaceable. We do not need them. Their senses of humor, their emotions, and their topics of conversation are all unoriginal, cliché, watered down recycled bullshit that has all been heard and said before. They are useless.  9 to 5er small talk/jokes in passing: ∑ (sigh): Is it too early to ask if it’s Friday yet?

      Philosophy is based on logic. This essay is concerning a controversial issue that stirs up emotion in our day and age. I am offering a philosophical explanation for my opinion on the issue. I ask the reader to put your emotions aside, while you read my argument.  We all know that “nigger” is a derogatory, racist term. We also know that over years the word has become desensitized among black people. It is, for the most part, acceptably used among Hispanics as well. Asians? I’m not sure. But I am positive of one thing: when it comes out a white boy’s mouth, the music stops.  If you call me ‘a nigga’ than how could I be prohibited from using the word?! One day a long time ago, some black person referred to a non-black person as “a nigga.” It must have sounded insane at first, but was brilliant in hindsight. To use the term that loosely was to make it not only a term of endearment for just blacks, but for everyone. “You want to call us ‘niggers?’ We’re going to call you ‘niggers’!” By the time this train of thought had reached hip hop culture, the word no longer had a racial, but a masculine connotation. Whether a black baby boy, an elderly white man, an Indian uncle, or a Dominican father, hip hop called you “a nigga.” By the same rationale, it started to sound wrong to refer to a black woman as “a nigga,” because she was a woman.  I heard black kids refer to me as “a nigga” long before I became comfortable using the term myself. But why should I not use it? If I were to respond by saying that I’m not “a nigga,” I would be automatically referring to black people as “niggers,” and reverting back to the negative connotation it once held. If I do refer to myself as “a nigga” I am behaving consistently with hip hop’s philosophy, and reinforcing the word’s neutral and masculine connotation.   Why not “honky” or “spic?” Why does the desensitized word have to be “nigga?” Black people were referred to as “niggers” in the past with a negative connotation. By taking the word and using it amongst themselves in the most casual of manners, they practically “stole” it from racists, and completely changed its meaning.  Non-racial use of the word “nigga” eventually brought it to the world of hip hop. As we all know, anything that reaches hip hop, eventually reaches white people. People that embrace hip hop culture adopt its music, its style, attitude, and dialect. Hip hop is a way of life. It has kids of all races imitating everything rappers do. To say that “it’s okay to do this, that, and the other, but Oh wait! Not that” is inconsistent, hypocritical, and unfair. And how would one decide who gets the green light? Is it only blacks and Hispanics from “the ghetto?” Is it any urban blacks or Hispanics? Is it only blacks from anywhere? What about upper class, suburban blacks? What about white people who grew up around blacks in the ghetto? What about a kid who is half Puerto Rican and half white, and grew up in a predominantly black suburb? If you insist on a line based on skin color and geography, then where is it drawn?  Black people were bold enough to adopt their own derogatory term, and transform it into a term of endearment amongst them selves. White and Hispanic people (in America, at least) were not. Black people also subsequently pioneered the hip hop movement that would go on to dictate the styles and behaviors of its entire generation. White and Hispanic people did not (I know Puerto Ricans played their part but it was predominantly blacks). These are the reasons why we non-racially use the term “nigga” and not “honky” or “spic.” As ironic as it sounds, it is actually a testament to the strength and intelligent creativity of the black race.  If “dope” doesn’t mean “drugs,” then “nigga” doesn’t mean “black person.”  Hip hop music and culture has commercialized a dialect referred to as Ebonics. What Ebonics frequently does, is take words from the English language and assign them new meanings. For example “dope” no longer means “drugs” or “heroin.” It is now a synonym for almost anything positive (beautiful, delicious, fantastic, etc.). “Wack” is not a verb that refers to hitting something. It is now an adjective that serves as a synonym for anything negative (ugly, disgusting, horrible, etc.). “A whip” is a car. A “dome” is a head, not a football stadium. And “a nigga” is any male - not a black person. I think a big problem with the word coming from Caucasian mouths is the conflict it creates in people’s sets of beliefs and labels. “White people aren’t supposed to talk like that.” That’s the same thing as looking at me in baggy jeans and a crooked Yankee cap and saying: “White people aren’t supposed to dress like that.” People grow accustomed to seeing and hearing certain things certain ways. When they see a situation that contradicts these rules of theirs, it is a natural psychological reaction to denounce the situation as “wrong.” If you went outside your building one day and the sky was green, and the grass was red, it would be wrong. But we are not objects all grouped together like blades of grass. We are individuals with minds, and many of us choose to think for ourselves, as opposed to conforming to preconceived traditional roles society has chosen for us. Some people hear a white boy use the word “nigga” casually (non-racially) and feel like he thinks he’s black, or that he thinks he knows what it means to be black. I can testify that the hip hop white boy uses the term casually because he learned it casually. He didn’t pick it up from racist white people. He probably picked it up from urban minorities. To him, it doesn’t mean “black.” It means “male.” White people using this term is indicative of the social progress hip hop has helped to make in regards to racial integration. Just because a white boy’s dialect has been clearly influenced by hip hop culture does not mean that he is ignorant enough to think he knows what it means to be black. Some feel: “How dare that spoiled, white devil use that term like he’s one of us, when it was his people that oppressed mine!” I am sorry for slavery. I wish we could go back in time and torture all of the slave owners. But slave owners were not “my people.” “My people” are anyone who I like as an individual, no matter what race, religion, or background they come from. I am Jewish. Jews suffered through the Holocaust at the hands of the Germans approximately 60 years ago. I am sure that no German born in the past 50 years had anything to do with it, so if one of them wanted to convert to Judaism because it struck a passionate cord with him as an individual, it is his right to do so. I am not going to hold a grudge against some innocent person’s guilty ancestors on behalf of my ancestors whom I didn’t even know. That’s ridiculously unfair and illogical.   What I feared after writing this paper would be that although my argument is well thought-out, logical, and intelligent, it would be ignored and easily refuted, based on my lack of credibility. I am not a published author, nor a recognized philosopher, nor a social scholar. I’m just a kid with an opinion and some brains to back it up. To make it even worse, I’m also white. Not long after writing this I came across a book entitled “Nigger,” by Randall Kennedy, a middle-aged, published, black author. I read the entire thing in one sitting (highly recommend it). I was happy to find that he shares my opinions on this matter. I wasn’t sure how to incorporate some of the more important points of the book into my completed essay so I figured I’d stick them here at the end. The following in italics is all derived from “Nigger.” In regards to the idea that it’s okay for blacks, but off limits to whites, Professor Michael Eric Dyson says “there is nothing necessarily wrong with a white person saying ‘nigger,’ just as there is nothing wrong with a black person saying it. What should matter is the context in which the word is spoken. To condemn whites who use the N-word without regard to context is simply to make a fetish of ‘nigger’.” Journalist, Jarvis DeBerry calls it “beautiful in its multiplicity of meanings.” Black author, Langston Hughes had a white friend, Carl Van Vechten, who used nigger in his writing and casually in his correspondence with Hughes. It was okay with Hughes because Van Vechten “had shown time and time again that he abhorred racial prejudice, would do what he could to improve the fortunes of African Americans, and treasured his black friends.”  Finally, the author addresses Spike Lee’s attack on director Quentin Tarantino’s use of the word in his scripts: “Excellence in culture thrives, like excellence elsewhere, in a setting open to competition-and that includes competition concerning how best to dramatize the N-word. Thus, instead of cordoning off racially defined areas of the culture and allowing them to be tilled only by persons of the ‘right’ race, we should work toward enlarging the common ground of American culture, a field that is open to all comers regardless of their origin.” [Lee’s critique] “is almost wholly ad hominem. It focuses on the character of Tarantino’s race rather than the character of his work.”  “A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged,” but is instead “the skin of a living thought [that] may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and time in which it is used.”  - Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes   The most important thing is that we do not live in the past. We should never forget because we can learn from the past, but we should live in the present, and look to the future. People might be uncomfortable hearing a white person use the term “nigga” because of history. But that white individual is probably a product of hip hop culture, who supports equality and freedom of expression. As horrible as slavery and oppression was and is, it is not fair to limit an innocent, non-prejudiced person’s vocabulary based on the color of their skin and atrocities that took place in the past.  Recognize that there is more to a word than the traditional dictionary’s definition of it; especially when you’re dealing with hip hop, which is still the most positive and unifying force of our generation. Look at the person who is using the word. Look at the context they’re using it in. If it’s a stranger, don’t be so trivial. Don’t assume the worst so that you can use them as your punching bag to get out your anger and resentment. I am not trying to be black when I talk. I am only doing what comes naturally. Recognize that semantics do not make the person - the person makes the semantics. Words’ meanings are not the same for everyone – that belief is ethnocentric and ignorant.   “It’s just the way that I talk ‘yo” -Big L (“Ebonics” - 1998)

      I wish I were black… so people would stop accusing me of wanting to be black. I’ve been criticized since adolescence, for the way I walk, talk, dress, act, and the music I listen to. I take it as an insult to my intelligence and my character, and it’s wrong.  Black people created hip hop, and it has become a mainstream American culture.   In the past, culture has always been defined and distinguished by nationality and/or religious background. But many of us, these days, like myself, are third or even fourth generation Americans. We grew up without traditional “culture” in our lives. One of my parents was Jewish, the other Protestant. My mother was half Russian and German, and my father was half Italian and English, but there were no indications of any of these nationalities or religions anywhere in our household. My brother and I had Bar-Mitzvahs, but only because that was what all Jewish kids did at the time – it was as automatic as going away to summer camp. My family was far from religious. We rarely went to temple and we frequently ate pork.  Our home was a cliché American home.  Although black people did create hip hop culture back in the late 70s, over the past 20 years hip hop has become much bigger and broader than black people. Some are happy about this, and others are not. In any case, it’s true. Hip hop has become a mainstream culture/subculture in our society, and millions of kids all over the country and world have adopted it. But the Ignorant still consider everything that is hip hop to be “black.” Afros and dredlocks might be “black.” Cornrows and African flags could be considered “black.” But rap music, baggy clothes, a pair of uptowns, and slang are “hip hop.”  We cannot choose our race, and we do not choose hip hop culture - it chooses us.   As children mature into becoming adolescents and then adults, they need something to identify with. Our psyches naturally search for something that strikes a cord with us – something we feel passionate about by which we can identify ourselves. Hip hop did that for me and I had no control over it. People have asked me, “Why do you like hip hop?” or “Why did you choose to like rap music?” Stupid question. I don’t think we choose what music makes our soul come alive. I don’t think we choose what kinds of food taste good to our taste buds, or what physical attributes attract our libidos sexually. I believe they choose us. Just like we cannot choose what color our skin will be, we cannot choose what in life is going to matter to us.   When I first heard Run DMC in 1986 I loved it. I loved the sound. I learned all the words and listened to them every chance I got. My parents hated it. “How can you understand what they’re saying?” they would ask me. “Only black people understand that music.” How silly of them, to attribute something’s message or appeal to be determined by race, instead of generation. It’s not black people, but young people who understood hip hop music. Old, black people in the 80s had no idea what rappers were saying either. Old white people would have known this, except that old white people did not know or talk to any old black people!    Why attack me? I did nothing wrong.   There are a few possible reasons why someone might insult someone else. Either you’ve angered them, or they feel jealous of, or threatened by you.   A white person who “acts white” might attack a hip hop white boy out of jealousy. Maybe deep down in their subconscious, they wish they could be like that, but know they never could. Maybe they’re older and bitter that they missed the boat on our cooler, hip hop generation to the point where they can’t even understand it. Who knows?  I’ve been attacked much more by white people than blacks for my image, I suppose it’s for the same reason black people attack “Uncle Toms” more than whites do. I might be considered the “Uncle Tom of white people” (or the “Uncle Tyrone” as my comedian friend, Bobby Johnson, calls it). White people have always embraced black “Uncle Toms” because they feel comfortable around them and can identify with them. Black people hate them because they look at them as inauthentic traitors, “fakin’ the funk.” Black people, in my experience have embraced me for the most part, because we identify with each other  (thanks to hip hop culture and my own individual knowledge and integration), whereas many white people have alienated me and dismissed my behavior. It’s the same shit! The fact is that there are Uncle Toms and Tyrones out there who are perpetrating a front and do need to be called out. But there are many of us who are just genuinely unique characters that have knowledge of self, and still get unfairly, negatively profiled by our “own race.”  One night I was at Caroline’s on Broadway watching a Yankees vs. Red Sox game at the bar with veteran comedian, Bill Burr. Since I’ve known him, Bill has always been real cool to me, but this instance was the longest we’d ever conversed for. He went on a long tangent about how the curse of the Bambino was all bullshit and how it’s all hype because of a book some guy wrote. Jokingly, I told him he should write a book called “Why We Really Suck” about his theories on the Red Sox. My man Duce, who was sitting with me, laughed freely at my light-hearted joke on Bill. At that moment I saw Bill’s facial expression go completely dead and I could actually see the wheels turning through his eyes. He felt like he just got snapped on. He paused, and then was able to fake a smile to play it off. “See you’re trying to get underneath my skin now,” he said, “but I’m not gonna let that happen.” I couldn’t believe it! I could see in his expression and mannerisms exactly what he was thinking: “Who the fuck does this new jack comic think he is, crackin’ a joke on me, a seasoned veteran?!” Talk about a sensitive ego! The fact is that I wasn’t trying to get under his skin. I was just talking casually, but Bill proceeded to attack me personally… and completely out of left field. It was completely irrelevant but he immediately told me how silly I looked wearing my hat crooked, and my clothes baggy, and how I need to stop acting black. He put our arms next to each other to show me that I was as white as him. Bill Burr is a great comedian and I respect his talent. But that night I lost all respect for him as a man. He showed that his beliefs did actually reflect those of a cliché, 36-year old white guy from Boston. He also showed that his ego was as sensitive as the head of a hard penis, and that there really is no depth to his sociological awareness or philosophy. Bill Burr is an older, very “white-acting,” white comic, whose career is probably not quite where he wanted it to be. He saw me, a 26-year old hip hop white boy, comic on the rise, who really is down, and he attacked me personally, right after I cracked a joke that was barely on him. It was mad immature, and wrong of him.   A black person who verbally attacks a hip hop white boy for who he is, is no different than the corporate white guy in the office who feels threatened by the new, very intelligent, well-liked corporate black guy [from the ‘hood] moving up in the ranks. The white guy feels like a member of the opposite race is doing “his race’s job” better than he can. It’s silly and spineless. It’s like white men who don’t want to see white women with black guys, or vice versa. It’s weak. The real truth is that there are hood-savvy white boys with more soul and flavor than some black guys, and there are black guys who are more intelligent and corporate-savvy than some white guys. Environment and experience can have a much greater impact on character than does skin color.   I hate black people who claim that non-black people are “stealing their shit.” This is possibly the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. As if that black individual created hip hop culture. As if he sat down and came up with the slang, wrote all the rap lyrics, designed all the fashion, and completely established the image. The fact is that the idiot who says this probably has nothing going for him except that he’s black, and feels threatened when he sees how easily non-black people “do it” just as well, if not better, than he does. People should get their shit together and learn to take more pride in themselves as individuals instead of sitting on their asses and rooting for “their race” to accomplish some shit. To say white people are stealing your shit is an ignorant, racist statement. Those people just need to get a life.   Sometimes I get narrow-mindedly labeled. One of the big problems with my “subculture” of hip hop white boys are the “wiggers” in it (I despise that word). In his HBO comedy special Chris Rock had a very popular bit where he distinguishes between “black people” and “niggers.” Not only was it funny, but he was making a statement to mainstream society who don’t know black people, about the fact that black people are good – that it’s just the few bad apples (“niggers”) that ruin the bunch for everyone. The hip hop white boy characters who get made fun of by comedians, and Hollywood and everyone else are our “wiggers.” These are the white boys from suburban or rural “wherever-the-fuck.” They have never known any ethnic people and have no real understanding of race or sociology at all. They steal their image and style from rap videos and fabricate a cliché persona of “maintaining,” “keeping it real,” and “holding it down G.” These are the “niggers” of hip hop white boys. They get the educated, integrated rest of us profiled as ignorant wanna-be’s perpetrating a front, struggling through an identity crisis, while that could not be further from the truth.   To associate a negative connotation with people like me is dually hypocritical!  1) I grew up in the MTV generation, where schools, parents, and the media constantly beat the idea into our heads, to end racism – that all people were created equally. We were constantly reinforced to keep an open mind and to not ever judge people based on the color of their skin. A lot of those parents now probably regret preaching that politically correct bullshit that they didn’t even really believe, because now they’ve raised a hip hop kid, who in their eyes, “thinks he/she is black.”   Suburban, hip hop white boys may not have grown up around a lot of black people but by the mid-80s it didn’t matter. We were taught to not be racist, and Run DMC, LL Cool J, MC Lyte, and many others were blaring through the televisions and speakers of every home in the ‘burbs. The chances of us adopting hip hop as our culture were good. It simply depended on what happened to strike a stronger cord with us: rap or rock. If the answer was rap, then it was only a matter of time before we were wearing baggy gear, crooked caps, and speaking slang. Now you’re mad because you think your kid wants to be black. But if your kid was a rock fan, wearing torn jeans and tight shirts like rock stars it would be okay, because rock stars happened to be white. See that! You should’ve just taught your kid to be a racist like you and you wouldn’t have this problem.   2) People say you shouldn’t speak street slang unless you’re from the streets. Hello! First of all, once street slang is all over national TV, it ceases to be just street slang. I had a kid tell me the other day: “Yo Sauce, why do you talk like that? I grew up part of my life in the projects and I don’t even talk like that. So why do you?” He proved my point! He grew up in the projects and he doesn’t talk like that. I didn’t grow up in the projects, and I do. So obviously childhood environment is not the only factor that determines how we speak. The same kid was standing with a girl who tried to make me feel stupid by asking me: “Do your parents talk like that?” Is that ignorant enough?! I don’t know too many American kids who talk like their parents. Stupid bitch.  Second of all, there are many of us who are not from the streets, but may have spent ample time in them, or with people from them, to have genuinely picked up street slang. Hey, if you spend enough time in France or around the French, chances are you’re might start speaking that fruity shit.  One night I was downtown, outside the Boston Comedy Club with another “white-acting,” white comic named Kurt. He was a professional at the time, and I was a new jack. Kurt was talking to some Asian girl who I had gone to high school with that I probably hadn’t seen in ten years. When Kurt found out I went to high school with her, he discovered where I was from and flipped out. He dropped two other names of kids I’d gone to high school with that he, apparently, was real good friends with. They were two of the absolute biggest herbs in my school (I know that sounds mean and shallow but that’s what high school is. I’m sure they are very smart, nice men now, but their incredible lack of coolness in adolescence is pertinent to my argument here). “Wow,” Kurt said, “you come from a white background. You’re like a real ‘wigger,’” he told me. I was shocked, and so disappointed. Then he sealed the deal by telling me: “I know you Sauce. I know everything about you.” This narrow-minded, herb motherfucker found out where I went to high school, immediately associated who I really was with three of the biggest herbs in the history of my school district (who were his ace boys), placed a label on me, and told me he knew “everything about me.” He is a perfect example of why this attitude and perspective on the issue is wrong.   People say I can’t be down because my skin is white and I’m from the ‘burbs (the suburb I am from is 15 minutes from the GW bridge). By that rationale, from the moment we are born, there are immediate boundaries placed on how far from the stereotypical norm our characters and personalities may extend. BULLSHIT! Forget where I’m from or what I look like. What about where I’ve been and what I know? My high school girlfriend was a Dominican from Washington Heights. I’ve been down with weed spot owners in Harlem and the Heights since I was 16. When I moved to the city I became very close friends with mad U.N.I.S. (the United Nations High School) graduates. I picked up my slang and flavor in Washington Heights, and got my true understanding of race and the lack of parameters it places on people from my Manhattanite, UNIS friends.   A European can become a martial artist completely immersed in Asian culture, a black kid from the projects might become CEO of a bank or hold public office, or a white boy from the ‘burbs might become a Spanish, and Ebonics-speaking rapper (or comedian) with genuine soul.   I do not intend to minimize the experience of growing up in the hood in any way. I did not grow up in the hood and I could never claim to understand what it’s like to do so. BUT… on a philosophical level, the hood is just like any foreign environment. In order to understand it, all you need is exposure to it and some insightful intelligence. Because of hip hop culture and the thug image, white boys claiming to be “hood” has become such a cliché joke in our day in age, but the fact is, some of us are real, and we do get it. Labeling all of us for the ignorance of some is the same as racism.   Finally, where do you draw the line?  Everyone wants the line to be drawn at them. They are entitled to be who they want to be, or adopt hip hop culture and no one else is. Only they are allowed to dress, and act “hip hop.” Black people from the hood think Spanish and white people should be forbidden. Spanish urbanites think white boys should be forbidden. Urban white people think all suburbanites should be forbidden. Minority suburbanites think all white suburbanites should be forbidden. White people think only Asian suburbanites should be forbidden. Americans think Europeans (or all foreigners) should be forbidden. They’re all idiots! Just because it started in the hood does not mean anyone should be forbidden from adopting and practicing what has become an international culture that is beautiful, soulful, and arguably the most unifying, influential force of our generation. It may sound corny, but I do not want to be/think I am black. I am hip hop… Nigga!

      	Last night I witnessed one of the most amazing things in sports history. It was the fifth game of the World Series and the Yankees were tied 2-2 in games with the Arizona Diamondbacks, a new team who came out of nowhere to be the toughest obstacle in the path of New York’s 5 year dynasty. We would have been down 3-1 in games had it not been for the miraculous heroics of Tino Martinez the night before. It was like a movie: “down by two, bottom of the ninth, full count, and a man on second base. BOOM! Tino hits it out! Two runs score! The game is tied. The Yankees go on to win in extra innings! The Yankees win!” I couldn’t believe it. The roller coaster of emotion that game put me through could be compared to none other that I remember. I am 23 years old and pretty healthy but after celebrating Tino’s homerun, there was a period of 5 seconds during which I thought I might’ve had a heart attack. I jumped, I screamed, I blasted the music and danced like it was New Year’s Eve. My roommate and I tackled each other and hugged on the couch, wrestling around like we were 8 years old. When I went out that night I pounded fists with strangers. I hugged my friends and we all told each other where we were and how we felt when it happened. It was beyond unbelievable!  	Now back to last night. Last night, until the 10th inning I was all alone in my apartment….not a friend to be found. Not a problem. Watching this 5th game of the World Series was sure to be a lot more stress than fun anyway. A true fan is incapable of being too talkative or sociable when a situation like this presents itself. We had experienced a miracle in our favor the night before. But that, in no way, lessened the importance of winning this next game as well. I watched for 8 innings. I watched both pitchers put on excellent performances. I watched in despair as 2 of the only 4 hits that Mussina allowed were solo homeruns. All alone, I clapped when we had chances to score, and swore out loud when we blew those chances. We went into the bottom of the ninth inning in the identical situation to the night before. Down by two runs and seemingly inept at hitting against their pitcher. Last night I counted us out because it seemed impossible. Tonight I knew nothing was impossible….except I was pretty sure it wasn’t possible for the same miracle to happen the same way two nights in a row. The Yankees have shown us many times that anything is possible…but come on. 	“Two outs, bottom of the ninth, down by two, one man on base, Scott Brosius at the plate.”	 At this point I am laying down on my couch, after having been sitting on the edge of it for the past three hours, waiting for something to happen, and seeing nothing happening. My Yankee hat is tilted over one of my eyes and I am barely watching the screen. I can’t. All of a sudden: BOOM! I instantly jump out of seat. “NO WAY! NO WAY!” It’s out! “OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD I DON’T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!” I screamed and laughed and ran around my apartment looking for the phone to call my father who I knew was watching the game. He answered the phone laughing and heard me on the other end screaming. Even my mother, who wouldn’t know what a World Series was if not for Dad, got on the phone in disbelief. Mind you, this is 1:00 A.M., a good few hours past both my parents’ bedtimes. Not long after the home run my roommate walked in the door. Three innings later we did it all over again. Once again: it was beyond unbelievable.  	 	The game ended around 1:30 A.M.. I had to be at work at 9:00. Ideally I like to be in bed by 2:00. So I got into bed at 2:00. Unfortunately I couldn’t close my eyes until 4:30. I was wide awake with adrenalin and anticipation for seeing more and more highlights. I could have watched those highlights and commentaries a hundred times and not gotten sick of them. For two hours I sat with my roommate flipping through the channels, skipping the ones talking about football and Michael Jordan’s return, and stopping as if mesmorized at the ones showing the Yankees. I couldn’t wipe the smile off my face. I couldn’t stop laughing. I couldn’t go to sleep. It was the purest, most natural, and best high I had ever had. I woke up promptly at 8:50 with all the energy in the world, excited to go to work and celebrate with new people. 	The first person I saw was the security guard downstairs. He gave me a big high five and a smile and knew exactly what I was so excited about. Then I noticed a “friend” of mine in the elevator behind me. He looked tired and sedated-like it was a normal Friday morning at 9:00. I was glowing. He asked: “What are you so excited about?” This was almost as unbelievable to me as the games I had watched. I turned to him. “Are you serious? You didn’t watch the game!?” “No, I didn’t watch the game,” he replied. I told him, playfully of course, “You suck. Don’t even talk to me. I don’t want anyone talking to me who didn’t see the game!” I was still glowing. He responds to me before the elevator door opens: “Anyways, who cares about the stupid game?” 	I am not that ignorant. I am well aware that there is a huge portion of our population that does not care about sports. That portion has always confused me but I never really let it get to me before. Although, in the past couple of years, I am astonished by the ignorance, evoked by these people. I have been working at an architects’ firm where there are approximately 30 employees. Of those 30 about 5 of them are actual sports fans. I ask myself, “How does that happen? Where do these people come from? What is wrong with them?” They see the few fans in the office uncontrollably rejoice when their team has won the night before and yet they remain blind to the appeal. Instead they don’t understand it so they downplay it. We hear things like: “Who cares about a stupid game?” and it kills us.  These people don’t understand. It wasn’t until I spent so much of my time around people like this that I realized I was blessed. All sports fan are. There is an emotional and psychological element in all sports fans lives that other people don’t have. When these people think of sports they think of sweaty locker rooms, devastating injuries, and drunk white guys jumping up and down like monkeys. But they don’t understand what they’re missing. Maybe if they saw what Yankee fans went through over the past two nights they’d get an idea.  Watching these games is like a roller coaster going through pitch blackness of emotion. You never know what is going to happen next and you have absolutely no control over what it will be. All you can do is sit and watch and wait and within a split second you could either be on the floor with your hands on your face staring up at the sky in the agony of defeat, or you’re jumping up and down like an animal screaming at all decibles in the thrill of victory. Your emotions are as out of your control as is the destiny of your team. You watch them all year long, praying that they’ll make it to the playoffs. Some games are more important than others. Some games are more important to you personally than others. But when it comes time for the playoffs, nothing is unimportant.   Nothing compares to that winning touchdown, or the three-pointer that tied it up at the buzzer, or that homerun in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and one on. You’re praying, you’re nervous, you’re excited, and in the back of your mind you’re constantly prepared to be devastated, but you can’t turn away. Then, if it doesn’t happen, you sit down. You sit down in silence, pick something in the room, and stare at it. You stare at it in silence. For a few minutes (or I suppose it’s different for everyone) you’re stunned. That sucks. But if it does happen, you can’t believe it. For just that moment, nothing in the world…and I mean nothing else, matters. Problems with money, jobs, loved ones, friends, and the world as a whole all disappear for that one moment of extreme glee. You’re jumping, you’re screaming, and you’re hugging everyone around you because the group of athletes who represent your hometown were just victorious.  It does seem rather silly. It means nothing, right? In the big picture the fate of your favorite team should really have no impact on your life. Their status won’t get your boss to fire you, won’t ruin your marriage, won’t make or break your children’s future in any way, and it sure as hell won’t bring world peace. But one can’t deny that it brings something to the human mind and spirit that cannot be substituted by anything else. You cannot put a value on the adrenalin, or the anger, or the joy that can be brought to you by an athletic competition.    There are other things in life like this: meaningless little things which seem to hold no impact on the big picture of our lives but give us great pleasure in their present state of being. For example, the best movie you’ve ever seen, your favorite song in the world, the appearance of a beautiful woman, an incredible novel. None of these things seem to have any real impact on your life, but don’t underestimate where your life might be, or who you might be were it not for the existence of these things. I am a huge movie fan-filmmaking is actually a hobby of mine. But much like the tragedy of the World Trade Center, no movie can compare to what I saw the Yankees do last night. Simply because a movie isn’t real. You can say baseball is silly and meaningless but you cannot deny its reality. I love music as much as any person I know. I can’t remember the last day I went without it. But even the feeling of my favorite song coming on the radio cannot compare to the feeling that surged through my body when I saw the ball leave Scott Brosius’s bat last night. A song makes me feel good. But the homerun made me feel crazy. My mind and body, for that moment, completely lost control. The difference is, with a song, you know what is going to happen. You know what to expect. In sports you have no idea. A good show is a great experience and nice to watch and a beautiful woman is a special thing to look at. But a show, much like a movie, is made up. It’s fake. A woman is just aesthetic beauty. Sports are very real, very unexpected, and very much in control of your spirit. Two homeruns in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, two days in a row is a surge of emotions that include adrenalin, hysteria, happiness, disbelief, and thrill. For the fans of the other team it is disappointment, rage, anger, sadness, and disbelief as well. All in that one pitch. All in that one hit. I’ve been on the other side of the emotions with the losing fans many times before. It’s a horrible feeling. But I would never trade in the agony of defeat if I could never feel the thrill of victory again. I lose control and gain insomnia through excitement because I know devastation just as well (I’m a Knick fan for God’s sakes). But, who cares about the stupid game?

      Parents who verbally discourage their kids’ dreams might mean well, but that does not mean they are to be pardoned for their actions. The fact is that they are adults and just “meaning well” is not sufficient – especially not when it comes to your kids.   Some parents do it because they are afraid of their kids being as unsuccessful as they were, and they want to prevent that from happening. Other parents do it because their social circle is competitive, and filled with conformist children of conformist parents. It is all very superficial, shallow, and immature, and I disdain it.   It is impossible for one human to alter another human’s state of mind and motivation - especially that of an adult’s. How silly and ignorant of my mother. She insulted me about quitting smoking for years, trying to get me to quit. Sometimes I ignored her, sometimes I insulted her back, and sometimes I humored her just to get her to shut up. All of her words I’ve always taken with a grain of salt. When I wanted to quit smoking I did, three years ago. I did it cold turkey, and I did it easily.

      Gay people are not really gay, but just people with very serious issues. That pretty much sums up my girlfriend’s theory on homosexuals. I’ve always been very open-minded and liberal regarding all social, racial, and matters of the like, and so has my girl. But when I met her, and we started dating, I learned that she is not very fond of gay people. She’s not homophobic, nor does she actually dislike them. It’s just that the majority of the time, their overall vibe and energy annoys her, and she does not agree with the theory that gay people are born gay. The first time I heard her talk like this I strongly disagreed. “Gay people don’t choose to be gay,” I told her. She explained that she didn’t believe that they choose it either – but that it is due to severe childhood issues and/or traumatic experiences, that homosexuality is the only option for their psyches. She rationalized that if there are men who really want men, and women who really want women, why in every gay relationship is there always “the man” and “the woman?” And if homosexuality was nothing more than the innate attraction to the same sex, then why do gay men so commonly act so feminine and lesbians so masculine?   The theory is very not bad. I knew my girlfriend was smart, but so am I, and I did not necessarily agree with her. I’ve lived in Chelsea and the Village in Manhattan for the past eight years and am very comfortable around the gay community. They’ve never really bothered me, beyond corny behavior in public, and I’ve never felt any sort of homophobia. As stated, I’ve always been very liberal minded. My girl’s argument was decent, but not enough to convince me.   That was three months ago. Two weeks ago was the gay parade, 2004. I spent the day in Staten Island at my girl’s crib but came back to the city at night to take care of some business. I had to get off at Christopher St. on the 1/9 train. When I got to the top of the stairs I could not believe my eyes. It was almost midnight and the streets were still literally PACKED with gay people. White, black, young, old, male, female, thugs, dainty boys and girls, everyone was there.   The drama I saw on my walk home began on the train ride. I saw a thugged out, lesbian mother taunting, and trying to fight her thugged out lesbian daughter. The daughter was angry about her mother’s drug problem, and the mother definitely seemed to be intoxicated on something. The people I saw in the streets around Christopher were mostly drunk and high out of their minds. I saw endless lovers’ quarrels where the levels of angry emotion ran high. I saw tons of men dressed like women and women dressed like men (that was really nothing new). The block on 6th Ave. and W. 4th was fuckin’ PACKED to the brim with young homo thugs, and they were real noisy. It seemed like everyone was just dying for attention. Every member of every couple seemed very reactive, and over reactive to every situation.  All I could think to myself was “Wow, all the negative hype the Puerto Rican and West Indian Day Parades get, and they don’t have nearly the drama and ugliness to their scenes that I see here.” It was ugly! Don’t get me wrong. I’m a 26-year old hip hop white boy, Manhattanite, uncensored, comedian. I don’t give a fuck, and I’m not disturbed at all by rowdy people and street noise. I like it as a matter of fact. But the energy on the streets that night had a different vibe to it. It was desperate, angry, and ignorant. The stress, the crying, and the nausea I saw in people’s faces was troubling. It made me seriously reconsider my girlfriend’s theory regarding homosexuals.   I’ve lived right in the heart of Chelsea for the past four years – 21st St. and 8th Ave. right above the gayest bar in town, the Rawhide! I’m young, I’m in the streets a lot, and I’m real perceptive. I see what goes on around my way. There are a lot of drugs, a lot of drinking, and a whole lot of prostitution and frivolous sex. I look at these people and honestly thank God that I am not them. They act happy but you can tell they’re not. Many of them are very depressed, troubled rejects from the Midwest who came to New York for nothing more than to just enjoy their homosexuality, and to fit in. They have no real understanding of self, society, or even their sexuality.   What I’m trying to say is that many of these people are severely, psychologically troubled. I doubt there is another neighborhood in New York as high income/class as Chelsea [or Greenwich Village] that still manages to be so drug and crime ridden. I would also bet that the ratio of homosexuals with drug and alcohol problems is much greater than that of heterosexuals. Of course there is always the argument of “the chicken and the egg:” that maybe the reason there is such an intoxication epidemic in the gay community is because society shuns them and treats them as outcasts, and they are driven to chemical dependency in the same way crack in the 80’s was an epidemic most commonly found in poor, black communities. But… in New York City that would be a tough argument to accept.   I don’t necessarily believe my girlfriend’s theory 100%, but it undoubtedly is an intelligent one worth considering. Especially after seeing what I’ve seen.

      Shit considered to be thuggish and/or masculine, I find to be ironically cowardly and pussy. Everything from fighting, to cheating on your girl, to insulting your peers, to any form of violence can be traced back to roots of over-sensitivity, insecurity, and fear (all very soft traits).  Fighting is perceived as barbaric and masculine, but ironically, the feelings that make someone want/need to fight are mad pussy. If your [male] ego is so sensitive that you feel the need to actually physically attack someone over a meaningless beef, it blatantly shows how insecure you are in your manhood. This behavior is understandable in an adolescent because an adolescent has not yet become a man, but a real man should be secure, and does not need to fight. It sounds cliché but it’s true. A real man need not prove his manhood, and acts accordingly. Niggaz who always throw down are only trying to stomp out their frightened inner selves.   Verbally attacking someone, also displays a serious weakness, in the forms of jealousy and self-hate. People are not inherently nice or mean people – there are deeper roots based on experience for this behavior. To verbally attack someone and try and spiritually break them down with words shows extreme jealousy and/or feelings of self-hate – both very weak. People who dis others unprovoked, usually need to do that to feel better about themselves. By preying on the weak you are showing that you feel you are the weak. The truly strong do not prey on the weak. Real men know they are men, and are comfortable with others feeling good about themselves.  Cheating on your girl may seem like a chauvinistic, pussy-getting, “man” thing to do, but all it really is, is dishonest, and what is dishonest is not real, and what is not real is pussy. Many men are in a relationship with a woman they love but desire other things sexually. First of all, I truly believe that this is just due to an extreme boredom in their lives, a lack of soul and passion, and a very on-the-surface train of thought that keeps their mind constantly preoccupied with sex and their libidos. Get a life niggaz!   Second of all, if you got a girl and you want to fuck other hoes, a real man tells his girl: “I can’t deal with monogamy.” Any man who is in love and secure in his hold on his chick should have no problem with presenting this issue. But most men who trick are pussies, and pussies don’t have the balls to confront their girl with this proposition. They have to do dirt behind their girl’s back (the same as the difference between shoplifting, and a face-to-face robbery - obviously shoplifting is the softer method of the two). Men who cheat are soulless, and insecure about their hold on their chick. They crave polygamy, but need the security blanket of their girlfriend, and are so afraid to lose it, that they become willing to live a lie. What faggots.   In closing, the irony is plain to see and rather indisputable. Fuck what the hood and the rap lyrics say. If you fight you’re too sensitive, if you insult herbs you’re a jealous self-hater, and if you trick you’re just a coward.
