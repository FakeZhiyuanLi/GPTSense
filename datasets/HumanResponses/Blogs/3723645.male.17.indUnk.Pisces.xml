      Today had to be the funniest morning ever, my cousin came sleep over because of certain issues I won't cover for you to read, but just listen. This morning I was going to make me some coffee, I put the coffee beans in a bowl(don't ask why) so I could grind them later. I went to the bathroom and the next thing you know, my cousin is eating a bowl of "Cocoa Puffs". I asked him if that was the same bowl on the counter, he replied with a, "I'm eating the cereal you fixed! HAHA!" But then to his suprise he was eating coffee beans with milk. I feel so sorry for his mom, (my aunt) who's having to put up with his wired ass as I type this. Goin to Waterland (supposedly) today, we supposed to get in free, but I dunno my back's kinda aching. Peace

      LOL. Work was great, I have the next three days off and I plan to be a bum on every one of them. A guy came in Rouses today, and asked where the lettuce was. (second time since I've been workin there) It's not like we have a huge produce section! Well I'm out peeps, sleep is calling my name, well.. not really. Peace

      I won't let this build up inside of me. I really don't know how to feel anymore. I have anger mixed with sadness and like this queesey feeling, I dunno. I just needed to tell somebody.. anybody.. I feel pathetic, and I can't stand that. I have to go kill something, I'm gunna probably play Resident Evil or like Soul Cailber or something. later.

      Today was pretty sweet, woke up at like 12pm. (that's the eraliest so far this summer) Went to the ol WalMart and bought a CD binder to hold my freakin growin collection. My newest is Slipknot's Vol. 3(go get it). Went to Jess's house after, she seemed ok, but then I went to work. Candace came and visited, it was awesome. Then I went to Buurger Kang and almost got kicked out for complaining about the "Anus Burger". Then I tried to go to Jess's house, no one knows what the hell was wrong, so I left. Now I'm writing this thingy cuz I'm awesome. Holla back yung'n woowoo.

      Yes, someone has asked the dumbest question ever. Some hillbilly came into Rouses yesterday and asked me, "Hey buddy, where's the frozen foods?" I sat there in awe of how incredibly stupid this jackass could be. I've never met a dumber son of a bitch in my life. I think his IQ was his teeth count, like 3. Well I'm out bitches, been playin Halo. Bout 2 go take a shower then head out 4 work. peace.
