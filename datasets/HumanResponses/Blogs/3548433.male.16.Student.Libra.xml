      well i've been working a LOT lately, and i just am so tired.  i told dad last night i don't know how him and mom do it, working all day five, six days a week.  it's grueling, and i only have a part time job.  haha, i guess i'll get used to it.  especially if i want to build up my bank account, which i do.   well tomorrow my schedule is as follows: 1)switch laundry 2)take shower, dress, et cetera 3)go to movies at 10:45 to meet steven 4)watch raising helen 5)come home, finish packing, leave for school 6)be at school 1:50pm  then i'm off to see the wizard...haha not really, but i'm leaving at two pm for the yearbook workshop which i have grown steadily in less anticipation of.  right now i'm washing one load of laundry and drying one load.  after they are done, i'll switch them out and do one more load of laundry before going to bed.  that way, i can do one more load in the morning, and be finished in time to pack and leave.  and i won't be back until thursday.  i'm really glad i get to see steven before i go.  because he's my buddy.  anyway i'm so tired so i think i'll just lay down until my laundry is finished...i got a new cell phone:)

      i have a journal on this site.  i have one at livejournal.  i have one at diaryland.  i have one at xanga.  i don't use any of the other ones, but i wanted to have more than one entry in here, because i really like the polka dots and the fonts on this site.  yep.  indeed, i do.  it is pretty plain and i am sure zillions of other kids have the exact same template as me, since i chose one of the sample ones.  but oh well.  today was really good.  i went to lake julian with steven and we had a picnic and fed the ducks crackers, and laughed a lot, and then we went to the royal pines playground and played on the swings and the 'castle', haha...and there were these megaphone things on either side of the playground and we talked to each other through those.  and that was funny.  and then we sat in the shade and had a grass fight and then we left.  i came home, took a nap, got online...jono came home from work and we got mcdonald's and then came home and watched the second lord of the rings movie, which was really good.  and i want to see the third one.  yep.  they're just really long.  i work tomorrow and friday 4:30-9:30, which is going to be nasty because that means we close thirty minutes later and i'll have to close and i won't get out of there until ten instead of nine thirty.  but it's just for two days.  and it's not that big of a deal.  just thirty minutes.  and then on saturday i work 11:30-5:00.  not so bad.  then on sunday i leave for the yearbook workshop in chapel hill, which i'm really excited about.  because i'm a loser.  haha.  i get paid on tuesday but i won't be home to pick up my paycheck until thursday.  and i'll probably work friday, saturday, sunday....blah blah blah.  at least i'm making money.  and it's not really hard work.  more some other time, maybe

      i get to go see harry potter eeeaaarrrllly tomorrow morning, but i'm really excited because steven says it's really good and i definitely trust him.  then we're going to go feed the ducks at lake julian again.  because we're cool and like to be dorks and have fun at the same time.  i don't know why i just started this diary when i have one already at diaryland...but i just wanted to see what it was like, i guess.  i'm going to go read now...night!
