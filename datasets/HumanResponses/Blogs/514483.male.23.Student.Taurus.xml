      So Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don't typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren't making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that's fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it's great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard's overdue return.   Looking at Stern's website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick "The Dick" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.

      I think I want to move to Oregon. I bet it is nice there, and the weather is more temperate than here. The trees are bigger, and there are less undesierables (I bet). It seems like a place where there could be a lot of mass murders though, like Montana.   So today I refused to put on my seatbelt. I mean, really, seatbelts? If I was afraid for my life, or if you are, then ok, put it on. If you are doing it just because you are told, then you might as well just move to Red China. Wearing your seatbelt is the same as saying that you are willing to do whatever the government tells you to do, even if they have no reason for what they are asking you to do. Wearing your seatbelt means that you hate freedom, and in turn, it means that you hate America. Right? It's not like I am riding a motorcycle down the road at 60mph without a helmet or anything - well, at least that would be legal for some strange fucking reason. Who elects these people?  40 days or so until Madden 2005, can't wait. Woohoo for X-box Live.

      I have been trying work out the kinks with this inline frame crap. Any experts out there, please, drop me a line and offer your free assistance. Free assistance is, after all, the only kind of assistance worth having.   I have been doing this blockbuster thing where you pay one price, rent as much as you can. The problem is that I have seen nearly everything I have wanted, and even somethings that I didn't want to see. What's next? What else should I get? It has been getting so bad that tonight I will be renting 'The Perfect Score'. I want to cry.  The Supreme Court protected porn today. That's nice. I mean, I am not for censorship, but the thought of 9 old people talking about porn - that bugs me, creeps me out. I say we should put a ban on porn and old people coming in contact with each other.

      Saturday night I went with a small group of close friends and family to see Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. I went into already knowing that I didn't much care for President Bush, his administration, or anything to do with the Republican Party (desipite being a registered member of that party). Coming out of the "documentary" (and I use the quotes since we can all be reasonable people and assume that it was infact a slanted view of the truth, and thats ok, I respect that) I was very please and felt inspired. I was unsure if I was going to vote this time around, but yeah, I am going to. No more Bush, and no more beard, well, mostly. (I shaved)  2 races mean a lot to me this year. The presidential race of course, but the race to represent Pennsylvania in the United States Senate between Arlen Spector and Joe Hoeffel is of particular interest to me. When I was a political science student, gearing up to be a lawyer, I did a 3 month internship in Joe Hoeffel's Norristown district office (before the state republican's fucked up the districts). I learned a lot about politics there, and I met a lot of great people. Joe is a good guy, and I urge you all to vote for him. Arlen Spector has been hit and miss throughout his entire political career. It's time he retired, and I am sure that sooner or later he will start wishing that he was retired. Vote for Joe, do it because it is the right thing to do, and do it because there is no way 1 bullet did that much damage.   Back to Fahrenheit 9/11 though - putting a face on the "enemy" - that's what this movie did for me. What our country is doing in Iraq is bound to create a terrorist state. Claiming there are ties to terrorism and invading a country that doesn't really pose a threat to you, well, you create a self-fullfilling prophecy. If there wasn't a link between "radical" (and I would be radical too) Iraqies and Al-Queda before, certainly there is going to be one now.   In other news - I hate fucking Adelphia.   Here's another question - how does me paying my bill the day it is due justify a 15 dollar fee? I could paying it the day after to avoid overdue fees, but electronically, the day it is due - why does that cost more. Which brings me back to Adelphia. I had no internet this weekend - thanks. Because I had no internet, I had to wait until Monday to pay my credit card bill (Monday is the day that my credit card payment is due). 15 bucks - thats what you owe me Adelphia. I am not sure how I will collect this, but mark my words, I am going to somehow get that 15 dollars out of them. Perhaps we could call it even, since I do wirelessly broadcast my internet to all my immediate neighbors who are so inclined to use it.

      Some people say that voting for somebody that you don't support in order to defeat somebody that you really hate is a bad idea. I felt this way, I wasn't going to vote at all this November's election, but then I remember that we are in the minority here.  I think that there are probably more liberals than there are republicans, but the thing about liberals is that they don't feel the insecure need to get together and hug each other at big expensive ralley every few months.   I saw a car today that had a lot of bumper stickers on it. Vote Kerry. Re-Defeat Bush. Eat Bison. Eat Bison? WTF is that about? Clearly this lady and I were on a few of the same pages, but I am not about to bite into any damn Bison. That's when it dawned on me. While conservatives are a dime a dozen, and pretty much all the same - liberals have been able to be fruitful and multiply in many different directions.  Some liberals don't eat meat, some do. Some liberals like to protect the environment, some liberals would prefer to push over the rainforests and put up a cybercafe. We don't often agree with each other, we don't like each other most of the time, and if we were forced into a room with one another, chances are somebody would leave. What we have in common is that we know the other side is a lot more fucked up that us. So thats why this november you will find me, voting for Kerry, even though I don't think he is the best man for the job.   Just say no, to George W. Bush.

      Ok - the net has been buzzing about John Edwards being a liberal trial lawyer all morning. Do I hate trial lawyers - sure, just as much as the next guy, I don't think people should be able to bring useless law suits to court. I don't think millions upon millions of dollars awarded to anybody solves anything. That being said - you can't attack a guy for being really good at his job. Don't hate the player, hate the game.   John Edwards made his money off of other peoples suffering, ok - but Daddy didn't give it to him. If he made his money off of Saudi Oil, now that would be ok. I just dont see how you can attack him by saying he was too good at what he did. John Edwards is a hell of a lawyer, his speaking abilities can influence the way people think - wow. How is that an attack? Are you saying that if we elect John Edwards as VP, he might be able to solve problems through discussion and debate? Oh the horror!  To the republican's that are all over Edwards for his previous occupation - why not look at yourselves you Enron supporting assholes.

      I read a small blurb today that said Vice President Chaney called John Edwards and said that he was looking forward to a "spirited campaign." You often hear of this happening between opponents, but what do you think they conversation was actually like. Chaney swore a bunch, John Edwards used some souther charm, Chaney tried to award him an Iraqi Oil Contract - you know, the norm.   Maybe this is going to be a fun election. Announcing Edwards this week was good, but next week would have been better. It would have slid him into the conventions hot in the news, but then again, maybe he didn't want to contend with the All-Star Game.  Speaking of the All-Star Game, congrats to Jack Wilson, who we wont be able to afford next year. There is a rumor that Rob Mackowiak may be going to Florida before the trading deadline. Nothing will make me more upset. Winning 10-out of-11, you can't dismantle that, you gotta let it ride. You have to let these boys see what they can do. I think we have a hell of a team, and I think that the passion and talent is a lot higher than people around baseball are giving us credit for.   Steelers football is just around the corner. Gonna be a fun year, I hope.

      So John Kerry picks John Edwards to be his friend and partner in this election. Now they aren't applying for a gay marriage yet, but it is pretty safe for them to start ordering new matching towels for the West Wing.   I am a big fan of John Edwards, he was one of my favorites early on. He didn't have the passion that Dean had, the command of Clark, or the strange hair of Shaprton - but what Edwards had was a touch of class, a genuine personality, and a professionalism in the way that he carried himself. He also looks pretty.   John Kerry knew what he was doing. Edwards is going to be a strong player on the ticket, watching his real Southern Charm combat the snide ramblings of our idiot president is going to be very entertaining. A grade-A trial lawyer debating the law dodging vice president - sure to be a classic.   Early Predictions:  Secretary of Labor - Dick Ghephart Secretary of Defense - Wes Clark Secretary of Mad Black People - Al Sharpton  I guess what it comes down to is who do you believe more. Are these Democrats unmarked - of course not, they are politicans. When push comes to shove, I would rather see John Edwards watching my kids (i dont have kids, but still) than Dick Chaney. You want a fucked up image in your head, imagine Dick Chaney trying to change a diaper. Does that guy even have a soul (and I don't believe in souls, but lets just pretend)?   I think that's enough for now.

      So last night I went to the infamous Indiana County Fireworks Extraveganza. Wow. I was impressed. The boasted $10,000 worth of goods, and they did come through. It was perhaps the best 3rd of July celebration that I have ever been a part of.   Many people over look the third of July. I mean, it isn't the 4th afterall, but lets just reflect on the 3rd, shall we? Thomas Jefferson goes to K-Mart, buys a new quill, some ink, maybe even some paper. He reads by the candlelight, has a glass of wine, and bangs a black chick - a man that was truly ahead of his time. Through the night, he decideds that he is going to stick it to the man, and not just a little bit, not in a polite way, but in a way that will cause thousands of people to get on boats and cross an ocean with guns locked and loaded. Thats the kind of revolution that you can only get after sampling the finest dark meat the slave trade has to offer.  So, skip ahead, wars. We win, we win, we win, we win, we win, we win, we lose, we lose, we win, we lose, we lose, and we lose. Freedom, freedom, freedom, beating the Spanish, freedom, freedom, communism, communism, oil, terror, politics - if you can match those up - you will surely see the pattern - if we aren't fighting for our freedom, we have a lack-luster performance record in war. So if history has anything to show us - it is that we had better have a good reason to go to war, that or we had better be fighting the Spanish.   On a day like today, raining on the 4th of July - it makes you see the symbolic gesture of nature. Bushes last day of sentiment before the fall of his empire. We are talking about freedom, a war of ballots, fighting to win back what we have lost. Register, Vote, Kerry all the way.   They are getting close on the VP thing. He needs to be ballsy here - he needs to go out and do something strong. I don't agree with my good friend Jim, who says that Hillary is a bad choice. I thinks thats the kind of polarizing person you need on the ticket. I think you need somebody who can get people fired up. It isn't that we are in the minority, it is that the otherside votes more. Hands down we out number the republicans, they just have a better percentage turn out. With Hillary on the ticket, maybe more of us would show up. Apathy is something that the rain does a great job of washing away.

      In my opnion, 62 year old women who commit white collar crimes should not go to prison. It isn't like she stole 100's of millions of dollars and purchased a crappy hockey team or anything. I just can't see poor Martha deserving of hardcore jail time. Her rep is hurt, she isn't the same as she was, lets just let her fade away and life her nice quiet life alone. A strong fine would have been enough justice for me.  &nbsp; Speaking of justice, the DOJ and judiciary system in this country is broken. We really need to do something about activists judges, and mistrials, and crooked cops, and loopholes. We need to round up the whole mess of people involved, and start from scratch. There are a lot of good people out there, but it is impossible to be as good as you could be with all these stupid rules.  &nbsp; Have you ever been pulled over by a cop who wasnt an asshole? &nbsp; Big benefit dance for MSD this weekend. My mom has put a lot of hardwork into this fundraiser, and I want her to know how proud of her we all are. Great job, the way you put yourself before others is a true inspriation.  &nbsp; Is it just me, or is this summer flying by?

      You dont know how happy I am that over half of the senate isn't completely retarded. Finally they have made it a point to say that local social issues aren't the business of the United States Senate. Maybe this is a trend that will fall into the election, maybe we should make this the cornerstone of freedom for the election. One side wants to give you choices, the other side wants to make choices for you - that's a pretty clear and solid message.   I think it is time that we started talking about the hard issues, lets stop dodging it - lets go right at it?   Assualt weapons - you don't need them, lets make them illegal.   Drugs - the 'war' on drugs has not worked, so lets stop that and start putting all of that money into urban renewal programs that will in turn keep people off of drugs. It is clear that poor people are the ones being exploited and taken to jail over small drug charges. If we help the poor people out, give them a helping hand with the same money that we use to hold them down - then maybe we could make changes.   Money to Other Countries - nope, sorry, not anymore. We will contribute only what other countries are willing to contribute, and only to countries that hold their companies and governments to the same hight standards that we hold our own to. Why give money to a country that pollutes? Why give money to a country that doesn't have an adequate minimum wage?  These are some hard issues, issues that are important, a lot more important than what free people do with each other. It's time that somebody stood up to the plate and started going after what really matters.

      Today everybody is writing a book, hell, maybe I will write a book. Apparently all it takes is a few dim witted people who have their own conservative news outlet. These neo-cons write a book, and then the left writes a counter book invoking humor as to dull down the outrage that could clearly be shown. Then neo-cons find fans to write books about the books that were writen about the original books. From there it gets press and then people write articles, go on news networks and fight back and forth about which side is right. So who is right? How do you sift through the garbage?  Here are some helpful tip's:  1. if it comes from somebody who has their own tv show, don't believe it. Trust that being extreme = rating and that you dont want to get your news from somebody who just wants ratings.   2. if somebody running for eleciton says it, keep in mind that they are running for election so their judgement is flawed and they really dont mean what they say.   3. if it comes from a bitchy lady named Ann, simply write it down, fold it several times, put it in your back pocket, remove your pants, and throw them away. She is mad, wrong, and really really bad at making a point. The kind of girl you would take home to mom if you could get her out of hell for the evening.   most importantly,   4. if it fits into a nice sound-bite, forget it, drop it, run away. Politics and policy issues don't sum up in nice sound bites. "It's the economy stupid" - looks nice on a poster, but simply by hearing that you can't make a judgement about the person saying it. They are meaningless and over played. We have short attention spans, and we like to hear things that don't take up time. Why? So that we can have our news in eye drop size containers and then get right back to the opinion of the person giving us the news.   Ok. Thats it for today. I am really getting sick of politics.

      So I bought the new NCAA 2005 for Xbox. I like it, its good, but it doesn't have player names - that kills me. I hate playing with QB #3. WTF. I guess I can understand it, but fake the games, Madden fakes the names in the draft every year, so why not just fake these names. Come on people. The game plays well, not perfect, but it will hold me over until Madden comes out next month.   I am not in a very political mood today - trying to work on some of the paper work for my internship.

      Under no circumstnaces should the election be delayed in November. Events happen, people are influenced. So what? People should take responsiblity and do what they have to do. If there was a big terrorist attack the day before the election - would I change my vote? No. I don't think it would actually effect the outcome of the eleciton at all. People will either flock to Bush or blame him - and the people that would blame him are already not going to vote for him, and the people who will praise him are already in his pocket.   Ron Reagan Jr. is speaking at the Democratic Convention - thats good, I like him. Stem cell research is important, hopefully this can be a key issue in the election.   Randomly - Autographs are stupid. I don't get it. It is a product of celebrity obsession, and can be dangerous to ones own perception of what is and is not important in life. Grow up, famous people aren't any better than anybody else.

      In the next 10 years, I think education is going to change completely. Right now, we are funding the status quo, ensuring that everybody will reach a minimum level of comprehension. What we fail to do is provide funding for students who are above the minimum. Does it make sense to dump money into students who don't want to learn? Clearly the 'problem' students are the ones who eat up the most resources - why is that? Why aren't we letting them fall into a world of pushing carts at walmart? Why not take all of that money that is ear-marked for them, and lets put it to the students who really want to learn? Imagine what we could do - if we just started leave children behind.   My focus is distance learning - multimedia learning - a dynamic and enriched classroom fulled with expensive equipment designed specifically to connect students with information in a way that they are comfortable with, and at a speed that works for them. We aren't all interested in the same things, and junior high and high schools aren't able to teach what we finding interesting in any great depth. So what if we spent 2 days a week doing the genernal overview, and then let the students have 3 days of the week where they could explore the topics that interest them? Clearly you learn more when you are interested in the subject.   The problem is - and it is a dangerous mindset, but it makes sense in a way. School is daycare in disguise. We cant stay home from work to watch our kids, so we send them to school and make them learn in ways that we all know aren't the best. We put up with it, becasue we have to work, and they have to learn. The system works, and it has worked for a long time. What if we just stopped the bullshit and started looking at education the way we know we should. We owe it to ourself, its our money that they are spending. Most of all, we owe it to the kids, because when we sat in those classrooms, we all thought to ourselves that there has to be a better way. There is, so lets just do it. That's my goal in life. To radically change the way we educate people. Freedom in learning is essential - thats one of the ideas I am kicking around for my thesis.

To be alive for the turning point in the way we view ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps this can close the book on religion once and for all, or maybe it will cause all new religions. Either way, change is way over due. Nothing like a message from ET to force the hand.   When will aliens make the political ticket? No, not Mexicans either.

      So finally a Madden rival has come out of the darkness. I like Madden, I like it a lot, but the overall experience of ESPN NFL 2k5 is right up there. With a $20 pricetag next to Madden's $50 - you almost have to wonder if EA is on the verge of a war. I am going to be willing to guess that next year both sides will take this a step further, and it will be the final great video game war before the next generation consoles. Things are going to get ugly, somebody call up Nolan Bushnell and David Rosen - they aren't going to want to miss this.   Corporate war is a lot less bloody than war with other cultures.   Microsoft & Google, while most people see them as competitors, I seem them coming together and taking on the rest of the world. These two companies have been coming under fire left and right for trademark and copyright issues - maybe it will force them to form an alliance and fight back in the name of innovation. Both companies have thrived on taking what other people do and doing it better. Open source isn't the answer - the answer is hiring the best the industry has to offer, and giving them all the resources that they need. The biggest problem with open source is that resources aren't distributed to people who have the skills to make the magic happen.&nbsp;  Down with open source.   If Windows fucks up, I know who to call - if Linux fucks up, who can I yell at?  I could be wrong, maybe everybody will go open source, maybe that will make things better - I just don't get it.  MSN Search is still way off - back to the drawing board guys.

      Went to see&nbsp;King Arthur and I-Robot this weekend. I must say that each were impressing in their own way, and each sorta turned into a steamy pile of horse crap in its own way too. &nbsp; King Arthur, great story, great action, awesome battles. The fighting was intense, and the interaction between the characters seemed genuine. The problem with this movie is that it isn't King Arthur - its just a story about some Roman guy. Now they claim it is where the story came from, but so what - who cares? I want wizards and magic and castles and all sorts of fake stuff that I have grown to love. While I can appriciate what they tried to do - it would be like trying to take the magic out of the bible - its just a pretty lame story unless you are allowed to make shit up.  &nbsp; I-Robot, another great story with some really cool effects. The acting was good, if you like Will Smith, and the use of robots as characters was great. If a robot fights another robot, and it wins best fight sceen at the MTV movie awards - does the robot accept the award? Can you award a prop? The biggest problem with this movie was that it was nothing more than 100 million dollar, 2 hour long, shoe commerical. It was also predictable&nbsp;- I dont like knowing what is going on before the character does. I need some suspense.  &nbsp; Also late last week I saw Harry Potter&nbsp;3 - Nicole said it wasn't as good as the movie, but what does she know? I liked it.  &nbsp; Bourne Supremacy coming up this week - I hope that will be a good treat.

      Last night was the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. While it was a night torn with right wing remarks, it did have several shinning moments where the pundits had to remain silent. Carted, Gore, the Clintons, they all did a masterful job of pepping up the party, getting everybody ready to fight. The game faces are on, the gloves are off, this is going to be a neck and neck battle right up until the end.  This is truly the biggest election in modern times - bigger than Dewy v. Truman, bigger than Carter v. Reagan. This is where it all hangs out - this is where we decide who is right, and what is wrong - and how America is going to approach the future. We aren't willing to accept the neocons view of a Christian society, doomed to be prudish and uncreative. We don't want people to be discriminated against because they are different.   When the Pilgrims left England, they wanted to get away from the heathens and sinners - not me, I wanted to stay. If I were alive int he 1600, I would have told the Pilgrims to not let the door hit them on the way out. But that was then, this is now - we are here, the Pilgrims are gone - sin is in. Fuck the Pilgrims, the Quakers, the Amish, and every other nut job out there.   Jesus in Piss - quite an image - it bothers Ann Coulter, but so does everything. I hope a house falls on her. I think thats how they kill them in the movies.

      First of all, hats off to the Pittsburgh Pirates. This is the first time in a long time that they have been close to .500 and exciting to watch this late in the season. I almost don't care that football season is just around the corner. Hopefully we can keep this team together past the trading deadline. Dave Littlefield looks more like a genius every day - hopefully he wont disappoint us. Starting to turn the corner, I can't wait to buy playoff tickets.   So the Democrats hold their convention this week, starting tonight and going through Thursday. It should be an entertaining and informative cornerstone of this final push towards the debates. Seeing the vision of America is going to be important, since we all know that the liberals are the true heart and soul of this country. It isn't the rich white man in church that represents us, its the poor mill worker who has to worry about how to get his kids braces. This is going to be the year where the apathetic emerge from their shells and vote, just once, just to get the country back on track.  I am looking forward to hearing what Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have to say tonight. Al Gore should also be intersting, considering he should be the president. I am sick of that not being on the table - it is percieved as whining when somebody talks about the election in 2000. It should be on the forefront of peoples minds - remember, we never elected George Bush, he was selected by his daddy's friends. Lets send him back to Daddy's house..   Wes Clark speaks on Thursday&nbsp;- my favorite of the candidates early on - and what he has to say should be very interesting. This is the man that will fall into a cabinate position, and he could become an important of the Kerry Administration.   Is U2 classic rock? BMG thinks so. I feel old.
