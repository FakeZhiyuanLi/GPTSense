						   The advertising agency I work for is housed in a hundred year old textile mill. The mill was reclaimed years ago and refashioned into a business incubator, which is exactly what its name implies; most of the businesses here are young, cash poor and hungry. They are all courting venture capital, or awaiting that magical relationship with Microsoft or General Motors that will make all five employees rich beyond the dreams of avarice and send them to tan on a golden beach somewhere. But these dreams for almost all of us are just that -- dreams. We stay affloat and do our best to keep moving ahead. We take good fortune in the little trickles it chooses to show itself in, and we hope that the next day will find the phone full of voicemails with work offers. In my boss's mind, we've made it. The yard stick by which she measures out success is the two full time employees and one cash-cow account we have to our claim. That second full time employee is a new hire, and his recent arrival has meant a smorgasbord of vacation time for that same boss. Our apparent competence, coupled with her restlessness, has meant a lot of screw ups and tense moments over the last ten weeks. Unnanounced days off. Lengthy mornings off. This has also thrust one tired twenty-five year old, on more than one occasion, into the flight seat of an advertising agency overseeing one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars worth of ad dollars per month. And he is me. And he is leaving.  When I was very small my sister lived in Washington, DC. We would go visit her frequently and stay in her craftsman style house in Chevy Chase, MD with her roomates whose names and faces time has seen fit to erase from my memory. What was never erased, though, was the feeling of being in DC -- the feeling that there was a whole world out there beyong the sloped front yard and cramped confines of my parents suburban home. When she moved back to our home town, it would be years before I would go back. A short trip with my dad and brother rekindled the flame. After that I spent several weekends there, drinking it in in huge gulps and taking ten dozen cameras full of pictures. It was around the time that my ex and I started hanging out with the hellyeah kids that I decided it would be the perfect place to live full time. She and I never talked with any certainty about doing it. It was always more of a fantasy we'd engage in, or something we'd talk about when the rent was late and we wished to be anywhere but the small town we lived in.  But now, as both my experience and my duties have begun to pile up (and my level of frustration at the lack of any sort of structure here) I am really leaving. And I didn't even know it until I met S.  I'm not inclined to be very sentimental, or put much stock in odd coincidences. But within the first twenty minutes I knew S, we mentioned DC. Not as some vacation spot or a nice place to get sushi, but as a  destination . Her talk of moving as we got to know each other became a constant. It pushed me to look inside and ask myself why I had dragged my feet so long about moving. When I realized I might be falling for her, I ran out of reasons. So here I am looking through job listings she's printed for me, or talking to someone who knows someone who might get me work. And the pieces are all clicking, Loudly. This is really happening.

      This is definitely going to be the little brother of  urlLink solitaryseventy-eight . Here, I can talk about things that are more personal. i know that keeping a blog is really about being okay with telling all, but I'm just not.

      I just came back to this after a few months of forgetting it was even here. I've been working so hard on my own content management system that I just forgot to do things like update this. Or sleep. Or eat things that weren't in cardboard pouches. I guess I've forgotten a lot of things, many of which were of extreme paramount importance. Others I'm okay with. So, I think I'll use this as a photolog when I get my  urlLink new camera . Or should I get the  urlLink guitar  first?

      S is upstairs. Right now. Asleep in my bed. I am here, in the living room. Updating this thing. This is because, as far as she knows, I'm not sleepy. This is only partly true. The actual truth is closer to my own increasing confusion about exactly what is happening between us.  Here's what happens. We hold. We touch. Anything beyond that seems tolerated, but not exactly enjoyed. Perhaps that's a bit harsh. But it's the way I feel. I can't say anything, though. I'm sure if I did it would be sort of a problem. So I just do the best I can with what I have. Which, granted, is a lot. I mean, should my own inability to understand the finer points of asexual platonic sleeping be grounds to doubt any possibility of this relationship mutating into something else? Probably not. And yet, I find myself feeling a little frustrated with things every now and again.  This is wrong, I know. This is selfish and stupid and childish. Still, I can't beat back the feeling. It's there sometimes. Part of me wants to kiss her. But I stop there. I think after several years of upheaval in terms of my sexual role with L I'm ready to set it down for a while. But still it's nice to feel attractive, and not just like an object of comfort or protection or a guard against loneliness. Too harsh again, perhaps. But I still can't help it.  Tonight we happened upon a rock show in a very unique venue downtown. In an ancient junk shop there is a stage and a PA, and some friends of friends are playing music. S and I go at the behest of a figure from her not too distant past. So I ended up making a new friend and seeing a band I had wanted to see for some time. The seats in the place are old couches and livingroom chairs from the Eisenhower administration. Midway through the second bands set, S slides her foot underneath my knee. I wanted to let it kill me, but it didn't faze me at all. That's sad because I want to be attracted to her and have it reciprocated, and I want to have that secret feeling in the pit of my stomach that signals nervousness and desire. Maybe I outgrew it? Maybe it feels pointless?  Maybe I'm jumping the gun on all this. Maybe these things will come with time. Who knows. I want to see where it goes, because I value S -- her opinions and her time. I am jumping the gun right?

      I was so exhausted yesterday after another night of drifting in and out in S's bed. I don't know what it is about it, but so often I just can't sleep there. I still think it's a function of being too warm.  I snuck out for a nap during lunchtime, and felt much better when I got back to work. I drove to a client's and did a short pitch for a website that went very well, and I think my budget will go through with little or no changes. After work, I came home and almost immediately launched into a workout. I tried a few new exercises -- I can really feel the weighted side bends today -- and wasted an hour or so playing guitar and messing with Garageband. I had left S a message, wondering after her job status. Sometime later she called and asked if I'd like company. I did, of course, want company.  I should tell you that I am very self-concious about my apartment. I'm not messy, but I just don't own much stuff. I've spent the first few years of independant life amassing all the techie goodies and musical toys I always wanted, and haven't really worried much about furniture. I do have nice table settings though. This would mark only the third time S had been into the house -- and only the second time that the visit would last more than a minute or two. I gave her a very brief tour the first time, and the second time we were confined mainly to the living room watching The Office on DVD.  On the phone she asked what would happen were she to be rendered too exhausted to drive home? I replied something faux-witty about having something called a bed.   I spent most of the evening trying to keep my distance, since I'd managed to make it all evening without a post-workout shower. I brought her my Powerbook so that she could check her email, and she proceeded to raid my home directory and go through my photo archives. At one point, with just the tiniest note of emotion in her voice, she said to something along the lines of, "you really loved her..." She meant L, my ex and former live-in. I replied that I did, but that my romantic love for L left, along with my couch, long ago. S seemed encouraged by what she deemed my "capacity for love." She lamented the fact that so many people seem to not have such a thing. I only wish she knew the half of it. I fall in love so easily it's ridiculous.  After a shower for me, it was time for bed. Not awkward. Not weird. Just bed. S seemed to feel as though I was anticipating something. I genuinely wasn't, and was only looking forward to a decent nights sleep and maybe an arm around me. After popping a melatonin I drifted off and slept through the night without incident. Obviously, even if I wanted to, I couldn't remember the exact timeline of the evening after climbing into bed. Some things stay, though. The last emotion I remember having very clearly was the slightest twinge of something. It wasn't anger. It was just a need for some explanation of exactly what it was we were doing. It passed wordlessly. Drifting off, S said to me,  "You like rules." I smiled, made a puzzled expression for the benefit of the darkness and the nape of her neck. "No I don't," I chuckled. "No?" "No. I have a rule: no rules."  She's playing at not wanting to put things in boxes again. I'm already asleep.

      S started a blog of her own. She really is quite a writer. She also saw my blog, which has provided hours of awkward exchanges. Fun. So, since no one but me and people who might stumble upon it even know it's here, I'm going to start using this blog to say all those secret things that dare not speak their names in more polite circles.   S and I are both bound for Washington, DC someday. As she often reminds me, she will probably be there long before me. Though I don't want to believe this, I have to accept it; I just signed off on a salaried position that I can't very well just walk away from mere weeks after taking it. There are also the niggling money woes that still dog me, and my lame car. All the rest, like my debilitating fear of certain kinds of travel inherited from certain members of my family, are no longer issues. And the recent application (and likely acceptance to) a job in the greater DC area will likely give S a dramatic head start towards northern Virginia.  The time we spend together lately is blissfully strange, and more often than not I wake up in her room with squares and triangles of sunlight recreating the works of Kandinski on the wall behind the head of the bed. Sometimes I know I'm a warm body; other times I could swear there's something more than some intricate and bizarre friendship at play. I woke up several nights ago and rolled over away from her, only to have her call me back and throw her arm around me. It's sad to be 25 years old and experience that and have the momentary feeling that you could finally die happy. But that's the hand that my life has dealt me, so I can't beat myself up about it. Last time I was there, she was worried about the mess she had got herself into, chartering last minute flights to attend a round of job interviews. I crossed a line I had sworn to myself I would not cross. I put my hands through her hair and -- rather easily -- began to try and comfort her. She made mention of the fact that it was working, and it felt wonderful. But there is still that underlying strangeness. The good news is that as time goes the relationship gets to be less and less strange and more solid and substantial.  In the background of all this I am trying not to notice my clothes getting a bit looser, and my face developing something that other humans call a  chin . Who knew. Once again, after a period that found me deriding him, I owe a great debt to Henry Rollins once again. And to my brothers W and A. I'm sure one knows it, and reasonably certain the other would never cop to it due to his unerring humility.

      Today, Augusten Burroughs is checking into rehab, the printer is having a meltdown with my art files, and I am looking for a new couch. I have also broken a long-standing date to go to the zoo and meet someone from YP that I had talked to earlier this Spring. I simply could not make myself go. I mean the print shop actually did have a meltdown, so I would have been late anyway. I just wasn't feeling any enthusiasm about it. Something tells me this is a little weird, because it was seeming like a lot of fun until this morning. I'm not going to bother reading in to all this. It wasn't even a date. It just felt...wrong? Wrongish, anyway, if not totally objectionable. I'm also still trying to figure out the phone call last night. I am failing at coming up with any solid theories. All I know is that I was upset that my friend was upset, and I felt myself wishing I could make it a little easier. Of course none of these things are required of me, so I felt a little silly. Finding my place in all this is a very engaging and enjoyable past time. It's the perfect thing to think about while you pick out sofas. So, here I go to do just that.

      I have been battling exhaustion for a few days now. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm tired of thinking I'm out of the woods financially only to have something new come up. I've tried really hard to get motivated about lifting, but it's proving to be very difficult; I start working and I fall asleep between sets on the bench. This really isn't helpful. I think all of this is pointing to a change of venue. I spoke to the owner of a company that offered me a job. I ultimately turned it down in favor of the newly-salaried job I currently have, but he could tell I was apprehensive about letting it go. I told him about my desire to move to the DC area, and he brightened up. He basically told me to name my field and he can find work for me. I told him money was an issue, and that I wouldn't take a pay cut. He was unfazed. So it looks as though the employment scene there might not be as tough to crack as I thought. He told me not to worry about degrees or credentials because, as he said, "your portfolio speaks for itself." I haven't told a soul any of this yet, but it makes me feel incredible to think that I might actually be able to network my way up to DC before I'm 26. It also doesn't hurt that I could be making $50k when I do it. Fuck, that looks snotty to read. But can I help it that I want to be comfortable and not struggle anymore? So today, while I try to make something out of the nothing that is the days job orders, I'm looking at Craig's List for places to rent. One of my other difficulties when moving will be trying to deal with my lousy credit, which has a way of making it difficult to rent anywhere. I've resigned myself to a bad credit score for some time, even though I am well on my way to crawling out from under the vast majority of the debt that I accrued when I was younger. Still, sharing a place with a room mate may not prove to be too weird, and I'll probably be spending the first year in the new place just finding my way around and having all kinds of crazy fun, merely using my apartment to sleep and nothing else. There's WiFi all over DC, so I could even work in restaurants and bars if I have to. I'm just prepared to  go ; I don't want to over think it and bellyache about where I'll stay or money or transportation. Of course I want somewhere to live and some way to get around. But I'm inspired by the ways my friends have found to set their sites on a new town and just pick up and go -- especially Reuben, who always manages to fly slightly by the seat of his pants and have fun doing it. I think if dreaming about something almost daily without any resolution (other than two day visits) for five years doesn't kill your desire for it, then it's meant to be. So this is the year to do it. S says this is my test. If I am to be tested then now's the time, because I'm finally ready.

      S left on her trip today, but not before calling me on my office doorway weirdness. Fuck. I don't know why I get the way I do. It's ridiculous I know. I just start feeling so...polite? Respectful? I dunno. It's weird. So yes, When Harry Met Sally has nothing on the weirdness that is this. Then, as I reviewed the playlist I made her for her trip for the eight-millionth time, I realized some of the lyrics are sort of innappropriate. Maybe that isn't the right word. I just don't want anyone getting any ideas. Unfortunately pop music really hasn't found a way to write a song about whatever this is so you sort of have to find what you can and make it fit. That's why it's so advantageous to be able to put twelve or so tracks on one CD; I can take something from here and something from there and make it all cohesive. Sort of. Plus it's just nice to give your friends good music to listen to on long trips, car or otherwise.  I hope I am not the only one who can see the ironic value in that Daft Punk song. I mean other than the Gap's advertising agency.  This concludes tonight's emotionally indirect blog post. Who am I afraid of? My Powerbook?

      Sometimes I know exactly what Pete Townsend was talking about, when all the confusion of feelings and friends and the past and the inevitable future are all in your midst.   Last night was pure summer 2003. D (my boss and one of my closest friends) had some of us over to grill out in the rain. We had fun, had lots of drinks. A good meal was had as well. As I was bedding down on the couch (which was exactly where I needed to be, I admit) S called. We embarked on a pretty lengthy conversation, that included her reading passages from a book on Feng Shui. What most people know about this subject would fill a thimble, and is usually limited to the correct way to point your bed. Apparently there's more to it than this, going so far as to include notions that we might associate more strongly with Western psychotherapy.  Feng Shui can even tell you where to put your baggage. Or at least how best to prepare it for travel. Without you. Into the garbage.  I moved into this house with someone else. It was  our  house. I hate it here now. It's not like home at all; it's more like a place to store things until something better comes along. I don't hate it because I miss her, or lament our failed relationship. I hate it here because it still contains a lot of things that she left me to clean up and do away with. In doing that she left me the emotional baggage of two people to sort through and make final decisions about. I have only realized this recently and it's taking me a little time to arrive at the inevitable conclusion that if she left it she doesn't want it, and it goes. I know resentment can eat you alive, and it isn't attractive. The same goes for bitterness. Part of me bristles at the thought of unpacking all this and throwing it away, only to have to repack all my things in a few months and move.  Last night S tells me, seemingly apropos of nothing but I was kind of tipsy, that she isn't waiting anymore. It didn't worry me then, but as today ages into its afternoon it's starting to make me ponder a bit.  S also enlightened me as to her own personal theories about some facets of my personality, and I have to say some of them were not so dead on. I told D this morning about being a day to day person, and that S was right in assuming that leaving high school to go build websites has rendered me someone with loads of experience but no papers. Against her better judgement, D said, she told me how I needn't worry about finding work elsewhere; that it would happen, and that I should be glad that college hadn't "beaten the artist out of" me. She also joked that she might even write a letter of recommendation for me. D is worried about my leaving, and she knows it will happen a lot sooner than she wants it to, or -- shamefully -- a lot sooner than I've let on. And it gets shorter everyday. In the last six months, I have changed more than I have in the previous nine years. I am strong, and happy, and finacially secure. These changes are for me, and were made by me. These are the changes that will facilitate my moving and starting a new life, one where the internal changes can mingle happily with the external ones.  That's the top secret plan. The one I never mention. I will move. I will make good money. I will come into my own and I will be living in  my  city -- not my familys --  mine . I think all sets of positive changes are precipitated by a walkabout. Yes baggage follows you -- but if you're in a new town where it doesn't know the streets or the buildings then maybe you can lose it, or make it scared and small enough to put in your pocket. And best of all I will be doing this in less than a year. Saying makes it feel better, and makes it real. But there are topics I haven't breached yet. They'll have to wait.

      Ok. Here it is.  I'm worried that I'm slipping into a depression and I don't know how to deal with it. I do not want to make it anyone else's problem by yammering about it. But at the same time I have no idea what triggered it (if anything; my depression doesn't usually work that way) or how long it may last. Today I've been trying to actively get past it with only limited success; I had a healthy breakfast and lifted weights first thing this morning. I was early to the first appointment of the day. I even worked dutifully from home when the office got unbearable. But I'm still sort of touchy and liable to take things the wrong way, and I generally feel kind of mopey. All last night I had horrible nightmares that jerked me awake several times. I kept waking up and watching S sleep peacefully, and finding things to worry about.  And it feels so horrible and awful. I haven't had a mood in five months, so I am totally unprepared to accept it. That's why I'm fighting it so hard, because I just want it  gone . It's just inopportune and unwelcome and I wish it wouldn't happen.  I keep wondering if I jinxed myself by putting too much stock into what she wrote on her blog about potential for a flame out. But I'm not flaming out about that, or anything in particular really. I just feel listless, and unable on some level to let my vacation slip into the rear view and get back to work. I haven't really said how amazing and relaxing all that was yet. It's worth mentioning how fantastic it was to be there with one of my best friends, not to mention S.  We had a moment on the beach that I think I will remember for the rest of my life, even if all this ends tomorrow. There were several other moments that will linger in my memory for a very long time, regardless of anything else that happens. I keep trying to think on those things, and all my other good fortune, to try and shake this -- but again with limited success.   So right now I'm off on a bike ride in hopes that a little more exercise will help the situation, since it has helped the most of all the things I've tried. A refill of Lamictal might help too. So, here goes nothing.

      To hear my father tell it, the face of the American South changed drastically with the advent of air conditioning -- and I don't doubt it for one minute. I try to picture movie theatres that are full nearly around the clock, and lunch counters peopled by the sweaty masses nursing ice waters. This is the south of my dad's generation. Now the subtle clunk of AC compressors starting up is the soundtrack of daily life here in offices and homes. The heat finally killed the AC in our office this week though, so we're suffering and so is our attendance. The heat is almost a living thing, like a fourth employee who won't shut up and drinks all the coffee before you can have one single cup.  So it's a pleasure to have lunch with S and talk about the minutiae of our days, or swap family histories. Yesterday we rearranged our schedules and skipped lunch just so -- as she puts it -- I could watch her nap in my bed for twenty minutes. Yes, maybe that's a little funny. But all I know is that I have the inclination to do that sort of thing with her, but none of the "craziness" that has gone with it before; it just feels very normal and natural. I think the craziness we fear could also be called codepedance, depending on how up you are on psychology lingo. I think we could make a great team of some kind. Her ideas lately about selling my art have made me hopeful for a future where I can pursue fine art again, and flattered at her appreciation for my photography. But I also still marvel at our ability to live independant lives, and spend time apart if for no other reason than we want to. The relationship I am coming out of was all about codependance; we were rarely seperated and when we were it was out of necessity. We both hated it, but were powerless to stop. My greatest fear in any relationship is that I may lapse into it again, and I am greatly encouraged by knowing that it would have reared its head by now and it hasn't. I think there's definitely something here, and I'm trying to get over the superstition I have about talking about it. So I'm off to my favorite coffee shop to try and get some  urlLink work  done. Remind me to write a letter to GE for inventing this life changing thing called air conditioning.

      In polite conversation in the south, they call it 'the procedure.'   I think they probably call it that everywhere actually, unless you're discussing politics. Then it's okay to use the word 'abortion', since the word carries enough weight to almost be a political statement unto itself.  Anyway, that experience is a large part of why I got upset the other night when I undertook to clear out the first of several rooms in my house of my previous life. And in talking to my 'paid friend' today -- who is amazed at my progress, my forward momentum, my excitement at each new day -- she mentioned how easy it is for people to mistake your mourning for lost time or your bidding farewell to your previous self as mourning for something else. The fact is that I am so far removed from wanting to go back and change things that the thought never even occurs to me; I just look past all the junk and put the time and the person out of my head. The PF says this is common for males too. We are largely the "out of site, out of mind" sort, who tend to not notice when it comes to the leavings of an absent former partner. "You may not notice when it's there, but you sure as hell will notice when it's not," she said, meaning the feeling of liberation is empowering. And I know it is after driving all those years of being a sucker and not caring about myself or my own feelings directly to the dumpster and tossing them in.  I also told her about my move, which gave her a huge smile and a speechless moment, considering I barely wanted to leave the house a year ago when I started therapy.  She seemed to think it was funny, though not altogether out of character, for me to stop drinking completely until I learn to call cabs. But whatever works.  On my monitor at work, there are two Chinese cookie fortunes. One says  "There is a prospect of a thrilling time ahead for you."  The other says  "Soon you will be sitting on top of the world."  Chinese cookie fortunes are my only superstition, so I  have  to believe them, right?

      What's an hour of your new healthy life spent divesting yourself of your old unhappy one? It's an hour well spent.  The physical manifestation of my emotional clutter goes out with tomorrow's garbage. If I'm through there's no point in keeping any of this. It's as if L wants this -- to try and have the last word. Well, the move is the end of the conversation. And what I'm spending tonight completing is the start of shutting my mouth. I tried to clean earlier tonight, and I gutted my office of old furniture and crap I didn't want to move later in the year. But my effort was incomplete. The effort I made didn't match my new life, or my true emotional state. I was hanging onto things out of habit. It all has to go. I will sleep in my own house tonight. Mine.  So I actively sought them out tonight. In drawers. In piles of mail. Dressers. None of them mean anything. I was a victim in this whole thing. The days of feeling responsible for two people's baggage are over. None of the other things are even worth my effort to put on eBay. They go out to the trash as well as soon as I post this. I'm thinking about hurling out a lot of family baggage, too. I hang onto too much. None of if reflects me anymore anyhow.  And as stupid as it sounds, I need S to know that I'm earnest about my feelings. I like her company on this adventure far too much to risk it.   And I'll tell you, after you find the first thing hiding out somewhere and toss it away you feel like a million fucking bucks. And the sleep of the righteous and freed is your reward. I learned this tonight, this late in the game. It's amazing how many things in life you assume will hurt, and feel like flying when you actually do them.

      Wow. WiFi in the middle of downtown Greensboro. How cool is that? As long as I pick a spot within the shadow of a building I'm not too hot, and the reception seems as if it's pretty good all over the block. I wonder if it leaks into the Cultural Center enough to make it usable while I have some crab dip and a beer @ Europa? I just have to remind myself that for the one measly hotspot we have in Greensboro, there are probably eight million in DC.   Speaking of the whole DC plan, S and I have been having the time of our lives lately. After making it through ther turmoil of the last couple of weeks, and my best attempts to subconciously fuck it all up, we are both being graciously rewarded. I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to be taking these first few steps with someone like her. I feel as though I found a vein of serenity running through all the fast-paced goings on lately. Yes, Virginia, there is a girl who's smart, hot and hilarious. And she happens to like spending time with me.  Alright, it's getting warm out here and the car fumes are starting to make me feel woozy. But it was fun while it lasted. Off to spend an hour or two with my brother.
