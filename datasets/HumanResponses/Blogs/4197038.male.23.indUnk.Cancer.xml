        On Saturday, Chris and I embarked on our insane trip to Toronto to see SummerSlam, the WWE's big PPV show of the summer.  I had booked a Greyhound out of Newark at 10:20 Saturday night set to arrive in Toronto at 8:05 AM Sunday Morning.  Anyway, we get to the bus station at 8:30, print out the tickets and wait. At 10:20, we're concerned the bus isn't there so I go inside and ask the baggage people what's happening.  "That bus sin't running tonight." I'm told.  I immediately flipped out and called Greyhound.  Now keep in mind I booked this 4 weeks ago and the ticket I printed out said there was a bus coming. They tell me , and this is a direct quote "I'm sorry, the schedule changed. There's nothing we can do about that, so call customer service Monday morning and they can give you a voucher or a refund." Suffice to say, I uttered several explatives in reply and hung up. Now I'm thinking "we're fucked....we're out the money for the Wrestling tickets and the weekend is dead.    Thankfully, Chris' mom checked and found out there was abus leaving the NYC Port Authority at 1:15 A.M.  and would get to Toronto at 1:00 PM Sunday.  So we jump on a train to the city and exchange the old (phantom) tickets for new ones.  The bus ride there was ok, but horribly uncomfortable. It's tough to sleep on a bus when sitting next to someone, but at that point, we were happy just to be on the way.    There were some creepy people on the bus, like this balding guy who was kind of slow and just weird overall, and a fat kid and his annoying 13 year old brother, but you get what you pay for.  Anyway, at about 11:30 am sunday, we get to the border, and boy was this one Canadian guy a dick. He had a real snotty tone and told us to "Get moving!" as soon as he was done checking us.    At 1:00 we finally got to Toronto and immediately headed to the Blue Jays game where we stayed for 4 innings just to see the SkyDome, then it was off to the Hockey Hall of Fame which was a lot of fun with Interactive Goalies and a game where you play the goalie. I even got my picture taken with the Stanley Cup~! (I'll put it up once I get them developed.  After that, it was almost immediately off to SummerSlam which was a decent, but not blowaway show. The highlight was definately our section starting the wave and the final match between Chris Benoit and Randy Orton, which resulted in orton winning the World Heavyweight Title (for those wrestling fans reading who care).  We got out of the show at 10:40 and immediately got back to the bus station to get on the 11:15 PM bus. When I finally got home (well back to NJ)  It was 1:40 PM.  So in 36 hours, I spent 24 on a bus, 3 on trains, and 9 actually in Canada. it was insane, but makes for a good story ( I hope).      In other nes, Nip/Tuck~!~!~! was excellent again last night.  I hope the show survives after this year as it's rapidly become a favorite of mine.  I'll be taking Josephine to Medeival TImes~! on August 28th, and it'll be the first time I've been there in over 10 years and her first time ever, so hopefully that'll be cool.  I caught Alien vs. Predator, and while it wasn't very good (especially compared to the originals), it was entertaining crap.  Mostly ludicrous, some cool, but all in all, harmless fun.  This has gone on long enough.....I'll be back later

        I went bowling last night and kicked some ass bowling my career high of 199 (along with a clean game and 3 others in the 180's)   Anyway, while I was there with Erick(who'll get an important person profile sometime soon)  and Jaime(his girlfriend and all around good person), Jaime remarks to me that I looked like Brian Austin Green. The sad thing is, she meant it as a complement.  Suffice to say, I'm not quite sure how to take that. I mean he is a legend of some of the most ridiculously, unintentional moments in TV history (like when he as David Silver on 90210 was trying to be a serious R&B/Rap artist), but then again,  I guess you take what you can get.   Training is done today, and while ridiculous, the food was good and it beat sitting around all day to a degree (though for like the first time ever, I'm backed up with work). I'll post some much bigger updates starting tomorrow before the Toronto adventure this weekend and see if Josephine can guide me through pictures........until then....

        I'm on my lunch break and just jotting a few things down.....In the next few days, we'll have some more installments of "The Important People",  probably a piece on why I love Smashing Pumpkins, a film review perhaps and a lot more......If anyone has any ideas for things they'd like me to throw up, just let me know.......Nip/Tuck was awesome last  night. I'm happy Josephine got me into it......I'm in a useless training class at work until tomorrow, learning about things I learned about in college and not nearly as in depth.....bleh........

        This will be the first entry of many dealing with the people who are the most important in my life. Where better to start than with my girlfriend, Josephine.    Josephine and I have been together for about 9 and a half months now. I can very easily say that because of her, almost all the time, I feel like the luckiest guy on the planet.   She'll often comment that we're very different and that we like different things, but I *truly* believe that we're a lot more alike in many ways than she'll admit. When I first met her in July of 2002, we were both locked in other relatinoships, but I always liked being around her, and now there's only one difference, I love being around her. It's really easy to say. There's no one else around who I'd rather spend my time with. We could be watching a movie, jumping out of a plane (best birthday present ever~!) walking around, eating, playing a game, she could be correcting my (many) bad habits, espousing about trouble sleeping, playing with her cats, or doing absolutely nothing (a favorite) and there's no place I'd rather be. She's been so supportive (especially when I'm down, or have had trouble with school, or I'm stressing out, or I'm just in a bad mood) that all she has to do is smile at me, or touch me, or make a joke, and I'll instantly not only feel better, but feel special. She doesn't have to do anything incredible, and that's why I love her so much, because no one makes me feel as loved and special and great as she does. The best example of this would be last Saturday. She was sleeping and I was feeling a little gloomy. She woke up, motioned for me to come over to the bed, stretched out her arms and gave me a hug. That made me feel better not only for the rest of the day, but for the rest of the weekend. All with a simple hug. I try to do little things to let her know how much I love her and how happy I am she's in my life, but just ebing able to put it here makes me feel good. She's also one of the funniest people I know who deadpans lines with the best of them and is great when she's trying top torture me by tickling or playing with her cats.    She's caring, loving, beautiful, sexy, funny, intelligent, and just about every other superlative you could put down. She drives me, inspires me and fills me with happiness, and most of all, I'm a better person because of her, and that's why she's so important.

        So the other night, my girlfriend, Josephine, tells me that she created a blog and I figured I might as well take a stab at it......This post is to just see if it works...If it does, I'll put some stuff up randomly at work and try to at least keep it mildly interesting, like explaining things about me and other such nonsense as well as complain or comment on things.....I know you're just as excited as I am at this prospect......
