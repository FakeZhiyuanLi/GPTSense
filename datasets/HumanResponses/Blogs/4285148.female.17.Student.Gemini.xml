      Before Marcie adventured off to Flagstaff, she pressured me into auditioning for a local theatre company.  Nervous as all hell, I sang horribly but somehow managed to do a decent cold reading.  The couple who runs the program are wonderful.  Terrence and Stefanie are supportive of student actors and un-altered by the cold realities of life in the theatre business.  They offered me the part of Victoria, a small part and ensemble singer.  I don't think Terrence realizes how happy I was to be given the opportunity.  At the academy I get a lot of really good training.  I work hard with other talented kids but its not the same as actually getting the chance to go onstage and perform.  The experience is necessary and This can be a great opportunity.

      "now here is the riddle, guess if you can, just who is the monster, and who is the man?"  While babysitting the two Berger kids I watched the Disney Quasimodo movie in awe of the beautiful pictures and eloquent songs.  Writing a Disney song has to be satisfying, this is actually a lame fantasy of mine.  I mean what other songs do you remember from childhood that you can still sing to this day.  (My parents can prove this theory with an embarrassing home movie of my fascination of the little mermaid) Watching these old cartoons is made even better by the revealing trivia on my favorite website  urlLink www.movie-mistakes.com   Check out your favorite Disney movie and chances are you'll learn something new about it. (I learned that Belle makes a cameo on the steps of Notre Dam).  Though babysitting wasn't my favorite it was easy and entertaining.  Instead of Michael Phelps I watched Mulan and in place of the Thorpedo sat Tarzan.  Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting.  Give me comments about your favorite Disney movies, I'm just curious as to what you sing in the shower..."Just to live one day out there..."

      Today was slow and steady.  I spent the earlier part of the morning enjoying the sleep I know I won't get back untill next summer.  My Dad woke me up at 10 to ask if I was planning on being alive at all today.  For a couple of hours I talked to Jenna about next years theatre class(with both Laura and Kelli together), her senior photos, and Mr. Hagar as an addition to LVA faculty.  From someone who recieved a D on her chemistry final, I can certainly say that I would have loved to take science with this teacher.    We were having fun until she began to sing "Letting Go" from J & H and I knew I had to hang up.  Not because her singing is bad (because she has an unsuspecting , elegant voice) but because I need a few months before the ring of Taylors voice fades from my memories.  Instead we looked at the online pictures from the Nebraska peformance  urlLink www.rbruhn.com . (The first picture has Jenna in it, and the last has Taylor dying).   so much for accomplishing a lot today.  I'll leave with a quote...  "Live to make the child you were proud of the person you are"

      My first entry for this new blog was a depressing day. I devoted it to Marcie as it was the last time I'll get to see her before she leaves for NAU orientation week and school. We spent the day spending her graduation gift certificuts, visiting office max for moving boxes (we shared our common infatuation with multicolored sharpies) , and playing "old faithful" aka rummey cube. I promised myself I wouldn't cry , and I didn't. It was only when I had to give her one last hug goodbye, that really made me sad I'm not graduating this year with my senior clique.  I got home that afternoon to discover that my mom had deleted my Buddy List. Yes the fabulous Sarah Lee had delelted some  100  screen names. I salvaged what I could remember but I lost majority of my USY regional friends and old home school buddies. That will be a "FUN" project for when school starts, So please e-mail me your SN.  I got the packet of "important" papers for the school year.  I wonder who the new theatre teacher will be and how long he'll last.  The name says H. Connor but that doesn't reveal any detail, like age, ethnicity, or sex.  Oh well, I'll find out soon enough.  My cousin in Florida, Jessica survived the hurricane and the surgery on her overbite.  Though they had 5 days without power, she managed to meet a new guy.  She is truly an insporation.  Hope to have more exciting stories to tell and links up next time.
