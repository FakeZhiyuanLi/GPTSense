       Today I sit my little cubicle, overhearing stories between my coworkers about their children or the little nuances that really ticked them off this week, trying to avoid talking about anything more serious.  Monday there will be 8 less than there are today, in a small office of what was 25 or so when I started just a few short months ago will be more like 10.  Layoffs, man is it scary, we are a small company where business can really fluctuate on an account by account basis.  I am assured that my job is still secure, I work in another department, a department with one person in it, me.  I am the only college grad that they have hired and aren’t really sure where they are going to go with me yet.  I know I will be doing some sales, but they also want me to learn a little bit of the technical side of things as well.  Right now I am sitting here trying to keep busy, so that I am not on the net or playing some of the fine card games that Microsoft has created to keep you from being productive.  And its not like I am blowing of work cause I am just a touch of hung-over from last night, it’s really because I finished all the work that I was given by Tuesday.  Wednesday and Thursday, all I have done is try to create work for myself, which can really burn you out.  I have bigger dreams than dwelling in this cubicle and I will not let them die, ever.  I have heard a lot of older people hearts hit their ankles when I start talking about things I want to do with my career.  Mostly because they are thinking to themselves either, one day that boy will learn the hard way or I wish I never let go of my dreams.  Right now I live in Arizona and I am trying to make it to California, it almost sounds cliché when I write it on paper.  Being from the Midwest, I have always dreamed of living somewhere close to a major body of water, what is more major than the Pacific Ocean.  My friends and my dreams from a landlocked homeland, have only gotten me this far, the desert.  I can now at least drive to the ocean for the weekend.  I was a California resident for about a week once, I picked up from AZ and went, only thing was my going away party was about two weeks long and I went home to see the family before I moved, and I just happened to spend the majority of my savings in that time.  So I stayed in Cali for about a week, the girl I was dating at the time convinced me that I was in love with her and she was my future.  So after spending all my money actually enjoying California for a week, I went back to AZ to be with my girl that actually ended up being crazier than kid with ADD & OCD on meth.  You could only imagine it . . . the worst part is I left a very good friend of mine there in Cali. She had the money to stay and she didn’t want to go back from where she left.  I will always feel like I screwed her over no matter how many times she tells me that I didn’t.

         Do you think that you would SINK or SWIM&nbsp;in a giant pool of JELL-O?  What color do you think the gelatin mass would end up being if you invited people to help fill up this pool?   How many pans of the scrumptious gelatin desert would it take to fill up a normal size backyard swimming pool?&nbsp;   Do you think that someone would donate their pool to the cause?  How much fridge space would it take to hold all this Jell-o?In cubic inches of course?   THE ANSWER WE CAME UP WITH IS, I DON'T KNOW, LETS FIND OUT?  My&nbsp;old roommate&nbsp;and I,&nbsp; were sitting around pondering various theories and philosophies on women one fine Sunday afternoon, when a Jell-o commercial came on featuring a Mom that was having quiet a pool party where this gelatin delight was the featured treat for all the good little boys and girls.&nbsp; Then it hits us, as I see a kid jumping into the pool with his little swimmies on, wouldn't it be awesome if we filled a pool up with Jell-o and went swimming? You know&nbsp;you probably heard someone talking about it at one time or another, usually 4 or 5 in the morning after a good party where all the marathon&nbsp;party goers and sea skimmers are left talking about absolutely intelligent stuff, bad thing is everyone usually forgets all the conversations and the bright ideas&nbsp;after a few hours of sleep.&nbsp; Well anyway when ever a few of us get together and hang out until the crack of dawn we always get to talking about it, now here's our chance.&nbsp; We haven't made and real plans yet but that's what this website is all about.&nbsp; I recently moved to Arizona to check out how people live in the desert, its not to shabby.&nbsp; But out of all the destinations my friends live in I chose here to do this feat.&nbsp; Not only because its close and I wouldn't really have to spend any money to travel (leaves more money for Jell-o), but because the winter is a nice temperature, people would be willing to jump in and it would be cool enough to keep the Jell-o in its prime form, whatever that may be.&nbsp; Anyways I don't know many people out here and the ones a do either don't have pools, aren't willing to donate to the cause or their parents aren't willing to donate to the cause.&nbsp; So I call upon you, anywhere in the country preferably South or Southwest USA, to do your duty to all those crazy thoughts you have had, have now or will have one day, and donate a pool to the cause or submit your name and email to be put on a list to donate your time and effort to making Jell-o to go in this pool whatever size it may be.&nbsp; If I get a good response I will be getting in touch with some of my contacts at the radio stations.&nbsp; Who knows maybe there is a World Record to be made?&nbsp; I just checked on the website and I don't see anything there . . . Is it a sign??&nbsp;   Anyways welcome to my blog, more intelligent ideas to come I am sure . . .

        urlLink    Pappy the Gnome says that you should never waste time thinking of things that could have been, but think of the things that could be.  You'll always have time to do the things you need to do, but never have enough time to do the things that you could do . . . and if its not time, its money that holds you back, or your short stature.  Pappy knows!!  konrad
