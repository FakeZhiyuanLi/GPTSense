      OMFG!!!!! Today (as I said it would be) was the best fricken day of my life!!!!!!!! We went to the skate fest!!!! It was fucking awesome day!!!! we saw....... SIMPLE PLAN!!!!! they were on last though.... IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth the wait!!!!!! They were awesome!!! they preformed like their whole album!!!!!! THIS DAY FUCKEN ROCKED!!!!!  so David is really fucking hot! we all knew that but hey he's even hotter live! we were like in the back for a while and (by the way, my dad took me and dacia instead of my mom) I got sick of it and wanted to move ahead! so I just eventually ignored my dad and did what I wanted and it was soooooo worth it since I got so fucking close to Pierre and David!! but before then me and Dacia are sitting there and some punk chick walks up and was really close to dacia but she couldn't see her face. So when she walks away Dacia goes "OHHH was he hot?" and I'm like "No not at all it was a GIRL!" and she's like "OH, CRAP!" so I think she's offically swinging both ways if ya know what I mean! So I was like in talking didtance from David the whole time! My toes hurt and my legs from standing on my tippy toes for over an hour, it really sucks that I'm short!! so anyway on to the simple plan concert.... so David and them go on stage. Pierre's like "sorry it's so fucking late!" and Davids like "yeah I was, uh I was jerking off!" ha omfg!! I could have fainted! and so Pierre goes "hey it wouldn't of taken THAT long!" and David says "Well next time I'll just think about your mom!" lol OMFG!! It was great! I think my dad got a little uncomfortable though! then they preform a little which rocked!! they kicked ass!!! and then Pierre goes back to talking. He takes a big drink and says "oh this is horse piss!, my doctor said I had to drink it" and David's like "oh I've actually had that before! lemme have some" so he takes a huge gulp then goes over to a towel and spits it out! lol AWESOME!! then sometime around there Chuck it drummin and rocking so hard obvously he's tierd so he stepps out from the back of his drums and stands in the front and when pierre tells him to go back he's like no! it was so funny! Then he starts flipping off the crowd! AWESOME but then he goes all out and starts to "use provocitive hand gestures twards the croch and the mouth" and for those of you who have no imagination he pretended to jerk off in front of everyone! It was soooooo FUNNY!  So eventually it was time for them to go so they leave. BUTTTTTTTTT!!!! then we start yelling "one more show!" over and over rather than "oncore" we were kinda stupid! and Chuck comes out on stage and thanks us for being so "fucking awesome" and we're like yeah yeah we know and they ran out and preformed another song! so then they say this is a popular some and you here the drums start up and everything and it was........... 50 cent, "in da club" I know it might sound like I'm turning to rap and I"m not!!!!!!!! but it sounded so fucking awesome! It was all rock-ish!! UGH!!!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!  and somthing screwed up like the guitars or they forgot the lyrics and pierre like "uh... oh sorry about that how about this one....?" and they preformed "American Jesus"! awesome!!!!!! they also preformed "Crash and Burn" for only the second time for us!!! awesome song!!!! so they go off stage and pierre tells us he's doing autographs and to come check it out. now keep in mind they just preformed an hour and a half and it's twelve o'clock at night and their gonna push himself even more!!!??? awesome!!! so we hang out a bit and then my dads like "I don't wanna it's too late!" and I'm thinking no fucking way we're NOT getting their autographs I mean HELLO!!! so thier out by the tour bus (which I pointed out on the way in the consert! they could have seen me on the street before anyone else!!) so we run out and some people are bitchy!! I mean their doing YOU a favour not us to them you know!! talk about greedy! so I get my dad to get Daica's videocamera out of the truck and we filmed them for so long! It was awesome!!!!!! I have pierre like I promise a foot away ugh!!!!!!!!! I swear!! and chuck and jeff and seb!! But....... no........... David :( :( but I guess their is always next time!! so Pierre signed right next to his picture on the poster!!!! ugh!!!!!!!!!1 and jeff and chuck signed on the white part. But thats ok I'll just fold it and frame it!! and I got red bull today @ the concert but my cabby dad got mad since it was four bucks each and we got two. ughhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!1 awesome day!! they swore soooooo much today It was sooooooo awesome and hot!!!!! oh and before they we just screwing around and Seb started playing the simpsons theme song and Peirre's like "What the fuck are you doing?" it was so funny but The music was so loud I think I'm kinda def now and they sounded a bit like they were on helium! lol awsome though!!! Oh the title of the DVD has been changed to........ A Big Package for You! ughhhhhh I gotta get it!! so David's like "shouldn't it be a SMALL package for you?" and Pierre goes "Yeah but then it wouldn't be funny!" I actually was in touching distance of them! this was my first real punk consert! like I loved it!!! OMFG!!! it was awesome! A bunch of girls were like kiss me! kiss me and Seb's like "oh I can't I got mono!" and every one was like on man. I just thought I would love to get mono from a Simple Plan member! Today was really the best day of my life! I just wnna thank Simple Plan sooo fucking much!! thank you! I love you!! DAVID DESROSIERS!!!

      (I'm Just A Kid- Simple Plan) Mood: Content Hey, today was just on of those bla days. Nothing good nothing bad. Oh except my stupid French teacher is so retarded I could kick him in the face and it would take him a week to notice the brusy pain! Whoa..... that was outta character! anyway when I got home from school it was raining and i went inside, but like a 1/2 hr later I got an urge to just go out in the rain and stand there... so I did. It was awesome.... I just stood there while it rained then it started down pouring even harder I sat there until my hair was soaking wet and my butt was drenched(about 5 or 10 mins). It was really thereputic. Then I went inside freezing from the A/C and changed. Then I put on a warm fall sweater (oh yeah.... 1st day of fall today!!!) and warmed some Apple Cider and currled up on the couch watching Dedicate Live on Fuse. Then to make everything better Simple Plan -Addictied came on! It was awesome. So Dacia, my best friend (her pg. is....  Thatsnotcool.blogspot.com) has her boyfriend Adam over right now........ yeah anyway I'm still sorry about the whole almond joy thing but she makes me feel like crap alot too.

I talked to one of my best freinds today...

It was so funny! She's like "Back off I'll take you on!" I was like "Oh man.... just shut up" It was emmbarrassing in a funny way. Like 2 or 3 years ago if she did that I would be all winey and like STOP!! but it was funny... and as she was leaving to let me look by my self she goes "I'll see you later" like he does in the song. it was funny.

Yeah, you're part of it. I walk the streets of a Carolina watching people pushing shopping carts. And there's a guy above me and he's washing windows. Making ten bucks a pop. And he says to me... And I say, "Sir, well have you heard that this country is unequal still? History continues itself. And I did not create the rules. " From all I've heard and all I've seen, this place has broken my American heart.

      Alright.....  Bands: 1) The Used- They are awesome I love practically the whole freakin album.  2) Simple Plan- I dunno what the hell is wronge with me! Why arn't they number one!? I just I'm not so sure of my loyalty to them, dare I say it. I will always love them and David is my all time favorite, stay up all night crying, space out all day smiling, jump up and down, scream out loud, I love you so fricken much, guy but I dunno I'm not feeling their music right now. I pray to the gods of music that I just wore out their cd (twice a day for 1 1/2 years). I just need a new Sp fix like their DVD mabey or a new song/cd. I will always love them!  3) Reset- They frickin rock. I dunno what it is. Speed metal, rock, punk?

Just kidding lol I don't know man....... uhhh I'll get back to ya  Movies:  Worst 1) The Good Girl- it's not that it was bad but so depressing.

      (Punk Rock 101-Bowling for soup) Mood: Good HeyI'm ainting one of my walls black and I had to take a break, my hand is all cramped up. So Halloween..... I figured that since it was gonna be Friday the 13th backwards we should do somthing like go to a cemetary or drive around unlit roads or somthing. Well Dacia went trick-or-treating at her grandparents. My mom dressed Julia up in a girafe costume, she looked sooo cute. She has like no hair and the girafe hoodie had a mowhawk hair thingy it was adorible! So We went to a couple of friends houses to show her off. Then we went to Blockbuster and rented Wronge Turn and Cherry Falls. (There wasn't too many good movies left) Then we went home and waited for Dacia to come over.  We watched Halloween H2O on FX. So we are waiting for ever!!! and finally she is here. So we hung out ate some of her candy and then my mom tells me to go out side and check if her coat and keys were in the car so that we could leave soon. So me and Dacia walk out to the car and as I go to open the door my Dad comes out from the shadows near the garage and screams boo or somthing along the lines of that and he was wearing the scream costume. I sreamed to freaking loud!! I was trembling I was soooo scared! Then I started crying! lol I wan't upset I just cried for no reason. Me and Dacia were laughing but I was laughing and crying at the same time. My parents were laughing and my mom came over and hugged me and was like are you ok? I'm sorry! I was all shook up after that lol! That was like the best Halloween. Oh yeah!! so anyway we get in the car after that and head to a cemitary out in the woods. Seriously like there is no lights or houses or anything out there. picture like all woods zero people 11 o'clock at night and a bunch of scared chicks. lol. We go drive up to the cemetary and  I jsut looked at it and I was soo scared I was like mom drive! I'm not going there. It was awesome though. well g2g play my drums! hee hee!! bye!!

      (some song - Blink-182) Mood: fine Hey, today I reconnected with my long time best friend Chelsea. It's been about half a year since we have talked, so she called me this morning. Now normally I would ignore it and wanna be anti-social, which is okay, but I've done it most of my life and with the new year coming I think it's time for some fucking changes! I used to think that fate would do everything for me or whatever but now I'm seeing it ain't gonna happen. And I like to think of myself as independent so I'm taking this whole new year to make some big ass changes... I',m gonna get my grades passing, not let ass holes bother me so much, be more social (not like the retarded cheerleaders but more nice and talk to people I wouldn't of normally) be a bit more outgoing, get it? I'm defenitly gonna change things and corney as this whole paragraph sounds... I need new stuff going on this year sucked and I refuse to just sit around and let things come to me, I need to go out and get them if I want it. So starting 2004 fuck the old year, begin the new... I'm sorry for every one who thought this post to be retarded or wierd or gay, whatever. But for christmas I got...... Simple Plan concert tickets!!!! Score YEAH!!!! I can't wait my second concert by them!!!!! UHHHHHHHHH I love David!!, that made no sence between the two subjects but hey, your part of it..... ha ha American Hearts

      (Welcome To Paridise-Green Day) Mood: Fine Hey, what's up. I was being a real kluts today, I"m not sure what my problem is? I knocked over a music stand and a bunch of papers went flying. My Dad was kinda being an ass at the store so I pushed a shopping cart at him really fast and by the time I realized that was a bad idea it hit him hard. He's like "What the heck was that for?!!!" and I"m like sorry. I made an old guy laugh though... heeeeee heeeeee!

      (Your So Last Summer- Taking Back Sunday) Mood: HAPPY!!!!! Hey, sorry about the lack of updates. The reason why there has been a lot of absent periods is each time I log in I look for a certain blogspot that I used to read over the summer. I forgot the site name for like 4 months and finally I'm listening to the Taking back sunday cd, and the name hit me! I was sooooooo happy. the guy's name who writes in it is Penguin. He's so awesome. He has a crush on a chick and she doesn't know ect. it's really sweet. I like him....

      (Always-Blink-182) Mood: twister Hey, I'm really sorry about updating, I'm not being really reliable and I'm sick of it. okay start over. So I'm talking to Tayler today and he asks me if I was in cheerleading when I was little. I'm thinking oh shit..... yeah I was. So he starts laughing so a girl I once knew named kylie was on the squad and idk he just found out I was a retard on the squad. I hope you all can forgive me, I do NOW know how dumb girls sound when they say they are a cheerleader. but the point I'm trying to make is Tayler forced me to do a time warp, open the photo albums and look back. I know it sounds corney but it's crazy how much I've changed and how little I"ve changed all in the same time..... okay it wasn't corney just kinda WTF? So if you guys don't mind get out some yearbooks from high-school, pictures from grade school, ect out and look back, it gives you a really fucked up feeling that you can't get rid of. I looked at all us little cheerleaders, I saw girls from my high school now back in 1996it's nuts. I looked at dance class pictures too, those holy shit. The moms got to pic out our costumes. We looked like show girls eacha and every year, I swear. Straight up hookers....lol great times though.

      ( Tiny Voices- BoxCarRacer) Mood: I'm not sure Hey, snow day tomorrow probably. Cool.... So at my lunch table there is 5 people = Dacia, Jackie and Ryan on one side. Then me and Ashlee (that's how she spell's it I'm not that stupid). And there is 5 days of school, so every day someone is assigned to throw away the garbage. I'm thursday, that's all I remember. Well Dacia was today and I came up with the idea that one of us would challenge the "garbage person" everyday, (that way we all got a chance to get outta throwing all the nasty food shit) to a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors Shoot". So we tried it all lunch. We were laughing so hard it was awesome. I challenged Dacia and she came out with Paper, I got her with fire. Then we started all doing it and Jakie put in dildo, Ryan bomb, Ashlee water, Dacia hairy toes. It was stupid stuff like that. The whole table was dying. I think that's our new table game.  We have alotta lunch fun. Our table is next to the soda machine, for some reason it isn't on durring lunch though, but anyway, at least once a week some one walks over to it to try and use it, we all whisper "we gotta show look!" and stare at the hopeless stupid person trying to get a drink. then we clap when they read "machine turns on at 12:30". Good times, gonna suck next year when we all get split up.

      (Down - Blink182) Mood: What the hell  Hey, today Blink's new video premired, pretty good. Omg, I'm reading Penguin's Blogger, he is like my twin!Iswear!! I know I've said that before, but it's true.  Like he was listing old tv shows and bios/memories. An that old show "Are You Afraid of the Dark" was listed and the episode he was most scared of was the same one as mine, I swear to god!! It was that clown one, and I just remember green foam/slime in the microwave, each time that episode was on I would squeeze my eyes shut and change the channel. It was pretty scary..... so any way mid terms ended today with algebra, gag. I think I did ok but I dunno. Oh well. But honestly Penguin has like my same brain but a guy. It's really cool. I know you all probably think I'm crazy but he really is cool, I'd like to meet him...

      (I Won't Be There - Simple Plan) Mood: Great Hey, last night was great!! I was in the Mosh Pit with my mom, lol! I had alot of fun. But trying to get close to the stage blew so bad! I think I got skinnier from all the people pushing my hips it bugged me! Then this guy (I think) kept touching my ass to get me to move so that all his friends could move close (by the way dude, very good stratigy, but it takes alot more than that to get me to back away from the stage) but I just ignored him. My mom said some older guy was checking me out the whole time too, and I think it's bull shit because no one has ever looked at me that way, but if she was right then mabey I'll get lucky in Boston, I'm moving! Anyway, David look so hot, omfg! I wanted to punch him in the face!! When they played Perfect Pierre was on acoustic, and the rest came out 1/2 way into the song but David was wearing those cat ears! he was so funny! They were pink, he kept on doing like these cat claws. And pierre was talking and then they did that whole "Yeah baby yeah!, Say it baby say it!" and then he's like whoa! I just went retarded! he's like just right now, not progressing I just went retarded! and they talked about showering, Pierre said he hadn't showered in 4 days, and David's like "my kinda style" and he said "Showering is over-rated, sleep is a weapon" he's so damn hot. Pat was there! it was so cool, I've never seen him up close, he is not bad looking at all, I got his and Seb's autograph. So the count for two conserts autograph is, Pierre-1, Pat-1, Seb-3. Yeah not even Daivd's yet! I'm kinda pissed. So my mom starts talking to Seb, and she's like "How's David, is he sleeping?" and Seb was like "uh, what do you mean?" and she said "oh well he looked tired" and he goes "oh yeah, well he's just relaxing with his....... Girl Friend" yes, it has been confirmed. David Desrosiers has a girl friend. My life is over. I was a really defining moment for me, I know I sound retarded but holy shit, I felt like I was punched. I hate having crushes! ugh!, so anyway :(, okay so We are in the mosh pit wich was awesome, and my mom kicked some guy in the ass! lol she was so happy! so I'm jumping and screaming the words and my mom is to,lol, and Pierre looked at us smiled and pointed! He saw me jumping and my 34 year old mom jumping! lol I think I love pierre now.... anyway my mom was like the only "old" peron in the middle of the mosh pit it was awesome, everyone kinda smiled at her. So Sugarcult was pretty good, I would've enjoyed it more if the stupid old lady with frizzy hair didn't keep leaning over me to talk to her friend. But they talked about how Valentines Day sucked, which I agree with, and he said that was the only day of the year he didn't wear pink,lol. Shit Valentines day is coming up! That blows. any way, they all looked so hot!! Seb growing out his hair! and David! holy shit he looks hot with his hair like that, wow! So The merch list, okay I got the same MXPX track jacket Daivd wore that night on stage! yeah, and a mxpx sticker and pin set, and SP pins that it? wow that kinda blew. but I hate to say it but the first concert was better. They swore alot more, mabey it was because it was like my first real good consert? Idk, but it was still good, like you know how they all have a special Vip place? well me and my mom are'nt vip so they have one of those velvit ropes and my mom gets the bright idea that we should go there, and I'm like "mom no we arn't alowed" and she says no no let's go, and jumpes the rope, only she can't pull that off, I can't even pull that off and her foot gets caught and she falls down spilling her beer, and bringing the velit rope with her,lol! OMFG I was dying! so after that she ran over to the seats to sit and the guard is like would you like to go in,I'm like "that you!" so if you ever want consert vip, trip on your way there and they feel bad and let you go! It was awesome so we got balcony seats to see MXPX, they were really good! they Mike sounds like Pierre but a bit older, duh. But the consert was awesome, I know I havn't written everything that has happend so over the next month I'll be adding info shit, that was a really good consert and I'm glad I went. But...... David has a girlfriend........

      (Green Day ) Mood: okay so, what's up? I'm tierd I "missed" my bus friday so I didn't go to school. that was cool. But now I got a shit load of home work and I havn't started it yet. this blows. I was talking to Dacia today and she's like you need a boyfriend. I'm 14 and I've never had a boyfriend. It's not that I don't want one or that I'm a lesben or somthing like that, I just don't know how to talk to guys, I feel really stupid and get all retarded. So this summer I'm probably going to florida and I'm just gonna have to be more out going. It's like Jim in American Pie, I was born with out that part of the brain.  Have you ever felt that you wanted to go home while you are home? I know that sounds fucked up but like your in your house and you don't feel at home or that's not where you belong. I feel like that every day.

      ( Your So Last Summer-Taking Back Sunday ) Mood: Okay Hey, so it's been a bit, that 70's show is on tonight, fox at 8:00 you all better watch it! So here's the story, I really really really, don't wanna type it all out but I know I'm gonna wanna remember it for future referance, so here we go.... Okay my Mid term project for Vis Comm. was a scrap book with a whole bunch of shit, like bands that I like and alot of ones I didn't (I needed the grade so I just filled it with anything I could find music related)and stuff like that. So I basically cut the shit out of a Spin magazine and a Guitar World. So anyway Dacia and some chick were looking at it in her Vis Comm class (She has it 4th period, I have it 2nd so therefore I was not there!) and Dacia is like "Dawn dooesn't even like these bands, She only pretends to like them to be like me!" which is total bull shit, I don't wanna copy her or be like her. I wanna be my own person, ya know? So I talked to her about it and she is like "uhh I never said that, that's so stupid!" and now I don't know who to belive. Dacia my best friend since 1st grade. Or a really responsible and reliable person who told me this information. I mean, it does sound like somthing Dacia would say.... I dunno I'm just gonna drop it but kinda keep it in the back of my mind.... any way today was kinda fun. We had an assembly at the end of the day on "disability awareness" I felt bad becasue I didn't really pay any attention, me and Dacia laughed at each other through the whole thing. The reason why is last year, this mentaly retarded boy, Tim, was in my class and sat behind me. So he had really really bad pimples and was kind of fat, well really fat not to be mean, and loved pokemon and mario brothers. So that's a little background anyway..... he always acted kinda annoying and I was always respectful and wasn't rude. Then one day me and Dacia were talking (she sat infront of me) and she all of a sudden made a wierd face and began laughing. She pointed and I turned to my right.... there was Tim's big head stareing down my V cut shirt. I have big boobs okay? yeah I admit it but the retarded kid doesn't need the fucking stare!! It was so embarrasing. picture it and fat retard staring down at your boobs! I know this all sounds funny and mean on my part but I don't know how to say it all different. lol now go tell all your friends of my sad misfortue. oh man Fortune. that word reminds my of a guy named Kyle that was in my health class this year. He moved to Norwich. I talked about him before. I love how he says fortune, I miss him, he was really funny. Sorry about saying "really" so much today, I dont' know what my problem is.... REALLY!! ha ha that was gay...... bye!

      ( Tiny Voices- Boxcarracer) Mood:okay until I actually start thinking  Hey, my dad has been the biggest ass hole all week. Actually more like my whole life but thats a different story. So Wed. night I'm watching the O.C. and then at ten I decide to go to sleep. So I lay down but then I hear this little tap tap noise and I ignored it at first but I finally got fed up and went down stairs to tell my dad to stop playing the fricken drums so I could actually sleep and he starts flipping out on me, saying "I'm selling those fucking drums you never play them, there a waist of money!" I'm like "you don't need to sell them, just don't play them at 10:00 when we're trying to sleep!" and he is like furious at me just because I wanna fucking sleep and that inturupted his shitty "play" time. So then last night he was talking to my mom and I guess he called me something like a bitch or somthing like that. Then my mom tells me he said somthing bad about me and she wanted me to ask him what it was so I did but then he refused to tell me and started telling me why he was so mad at me. I didn't wanna fucking hear it so (by the way he always talks about his balls only before he notices that I'm in the room and then he gets all embarrassed. Duh like I dont' fucking know what balls are retard! anyway.....) I said "Listen if you don't have the BALLS, as you commonly refer to it, to call me this name to my face than you shouldn't be saying it at all!" Then his idea of solving the issue is sending me to my room. whatever. And I never found out that name either. As much as it hurts to say, but I'm not sure if my life would be totally over if he wasn't even here. I know it's bad, and somday I will regret saying that but he's not a good father. No one here is good. Mabey I'm being picky, but no one cares about me. Like with Dacia I try talking to her and mid sentence she stops listening and just starts flirting with some guy. I mean dealing with that bull shit everyday for 8 years get pretty old. Actually I don't even know why I'm friends with her. I have listened to everything she has to say, and even if another person is trying to get my attention and talk to me I tell them to hold on and put her first. This isn't right, I don't deserve this shit. Today I felt so emotionally worn out, I just wanted to die. Honestly, I know it kinda sounds like a drama queen thing but I wanted it all to be done and over. I think the only thing keeping me going is knowing that eventually I will get my chance to leave. Senior year I'm going to California and I don't know if I will come back. This was so long, really good venting time though, by

Dacia is in florida she sucks. So what's up? I really have nothing to say. Last weekend my cousin came down to see us and she is like a Hilary Duff and Aaron Carter fan so I promised her that I would help her get away from them. It will be a looooooong processe but I'm up for it. So every week  I will mail her a new cd in hopes that some day she will listen to Green Day or any other rock music as long as it's not Hilary Duff! So I started her off with Avril Lavigne.

Her biggest accomplishment was not conforming to society and staying a virgin, we have to go into class dressed and acting like our person. I have to say no to every guy I see, lol... OMFG! it was so funny this is the quote of the week: (I was in Vis. Comm and this really big stoner said this on his heavy metal music taste)    "No I"m not into the dark stuff.

      (nothing - ) Mood: okay, nervious Sorry if I spelt that wrong, anyway, Dacia left for Florida this morning so it's just me this week... So aparently she was talking to Adam (her ex from earlier thsi year) and Matt (actually he is her ex too!) and she said somthing to them, I'm not sure what it was but they were all giggly and doing the whole I-know-somthing-you-don't-know. But all I can make sense of it is that we were talking about a guy in school that they both think is gay,and then they looked at me mumbled somthing and laughed.... mabey Dacia told them I was a lesbien? Well I'm not so I don't know why she would say that... Another thing that might be is that, Adam was sitting on my desk, rubbing up as a joke and asking if I find him attractive. Earlier this year Dacia told Adam that I liked him, and I do but not like that, so mabey he thinks I still like him or somthing?...well I don't know, normally I'm really good with this kinda mind games but I'm so lost. I just hope they don'tthink that I"m a lesbien, that would kinda suck and not make it any easier getting a boyfriend. And if for some reason Dacia told them I was I'm gonna stop being friends with her. She's a bitch anyway So sorry to bore you I just needed all this info to refer back to..... see ya later! oh and Happy Easter! (late)

So anyway, I am so glad that I went, This year I've been trying to do things that I normally wouldn't do, and h my god, thank you for making me go. Okay Dacia's dad's girlfriend's son, Pat, was at this picnic/party. He is 15, he's got these wonderful blue and lightning eyes, and he is so nice, and pretty funny. He likes NY Yankees and likes rap, but besides those flaws, he is awesome. Like he just looks average with out his hat on, and then... When he's wearing it he looks hot. And it may be in my head, but we had a lot in common. (It probably is in my head) So my dad droped off some clothes and stuff so I could spend the night, (Pat, Dacia(friend), Sam(Dacia's little sister),Des(Dacia and Sam's aunt she's 17), and Maryia(Sam's friend), so I walk out to the truck and he brings my bright pink blanket and a blue fuzzy blanket (like those ones on the beds in hotels) I just by my gut feeling pick the blue one. I walk in and Pat yells, I have that same blanket. And every time we all hung out in a room and the blanket was there he would cuddle with it. He is pretty cute, I hate that word, but he was. I don't wanna write to much about this just so I can leave it to memory, god I sound like such an ass... He's just a good thing to smile about at a back time.  *oh I came up with this lyric, I'm sure it has been used but I havn't heard the song so just give me the credit. oh I heard my parents say this to each other during a fight tonight.  "you say your dieing, but I'm already dead" I like it  *oh and another one I made up a while ago in school, I cleard my head and just wrote anything...  "Chickens run dancing like rainbows in space"  It flows so well. So I gotta go, my mom is being extremely mean to me today, I was crying and I noticed that after a good cry my skin looks really better.  So I'm gonna go upstairs make some tea, cuddle up with that blue blanket and watch Paris and Nicole make an ass out of themselves.  Bye

      My horoscope for tomorrow, this just might be my answer:   Others are celebrating team spirit, but you don't see the need. Group activity doesn't count for much in your book these days. Everybody is paying lip service to the cause, but you can see trusted allies acting out of self-interest. You wouldn't do anything like that unless you were pushed, would you? Take these quirks and foibles of human nature in stride. It's nothing personal. And even if someone is out to get you, you're not playing that game. You still have a lot of hard work ahead of you, and you'll handle it alone if necessary. You're strong and focused for this.    *AND*   Quickie: Think more deeply about this. No one's keeping secrets. The answer is within you.  Overview: Oh, you're trying to keep that secret a secret! But no one will be angry with you if the other parties concerned don't cooperate. Prepare yourself.

      ( Nothing ) Mood:Sick, but better  I'm changing some names just so no one googles this and reads all this stuff, at least no one I know  Hey, My friend's family is having a Memorial Day party, Code for "Drunken bonfire" So I might go, but I don't know. She will most likely be drinking, and her "premiscous" friends are invited and they do all sorts of shit like that, but I don't know if I want to or not. Okay flash back time:  I remember in 5th grade I had the biggest crush on Chris. Okay I had liked him from the day we met back in like 2nd grade (he was in 1st) so I guess he was like my first love? and they say that is the most memerable, I don't think I like him, I mean I havn't seen or talked to him in about a year, but I've always been harboring that little hope that somthing would come of us. The closest I got to that was at my Ex-best friends (Chelsea, the one I hung out with on New Years)11th or 12 birthday party, when he was flirting with me the whole time, and he was really into me, they even did this bet thing where who ever lost at the game chicken would get to go out with me. And I vaugly remember him saying "I'm so not losing this" or somthing to that extent. (Shit writing about all this is bring back memories that I have pushed down as far as they go, anyway...)He won, but the catch to this perfect night for me, was that Chelsea liked him too. That ruined it all. See, he asked me out there I remember him calling me over to the front door, where there was walk down stairs so a little bit of privacy, he goes "will you go out with me" and retard over here goes "I dunno" But then Chelsea's mom comes over and tells us we arn't alowed down there, and need to come back up the stairs with the rest of the party, and to hid his embarrasment he started mumbling (he mumbled alot) "Uhh this is a nice front door, really nice door" It was really funny. But I was so over joyed and biting my tongue just so I wouldn't say yes because... Chelsea liked him. I could tell she really was getting pissed, she was so angry but didn't want to say anything because he liked me then, not her. And because of my fucking "loyalty" I said no, he was begging, the guy I"ve been in love with for years, but for "friend-ship" I said no. And now go read the post from New Years, I hate her now, so that was a huge waste!  Now that was one of the many stories, and how it ties into the Memorial Day party is, I remember being in 5th grade at the end of the year and soon going into sixth grade, he was genuanly worried about me, he told me "please don't get involved with the wrong people and don't do drugs" and I remember this all being so off the wall. And now about a year ago this summer, him and Dacia happend to meet up on a camping trip. (A couple of months earlier, My friends's Ex-boyfriend Dan, had beat him up, and Chris vowed to stay away from her for good) The two made-out the whole time. That really sucked. And he was also drinking beer, and I know it's not a big deal but, idk, he was like my modavation not to drink and do drugs, among other things, and then I heard from my friend he was drinking. Now I'm thinking about this party, should I drink to catch up to him, to look cool to him? Should I not drink because I know I shouldn't, because I'm a retard anyway, or because he grew out of that stage realizing it wasn't cool? I don't know. I am so confused wether I want to worry about looking good infront of him. I remember at the winter-wonderland dance in 8th grade he told me I looked like Barbie, and I was pretty fat back then, now that I"m loosing weigt, gaining abs, I might not be looked over any more. But I just don't know how I'm gonna look like to him. Maybe I am blowing this way outta proportion, and I should just go with what ever feels right. I'm just going to have to do what Andrew WK did, (he is really hot by the way) Expect nothing. That is what I'll do. To tell you the truth, I would love nothing more than to go into school next year, he would be a freshman, me a sophmore, and me skinny and totally changed, and he doesn't even recognise me, and if he does, I want him to be in total shock and have him think that I am way hotter than my friend,you know who. this is what I'm thinking about  *Cut my hair short *Dye it blonde *loose a little bit more *Get those Abs *Get my nose peirced *get new clothes  I think this just might work I'm going to switch places with her right under her nose

      ( Cute with out the E- Taking Back Sunday) Mood: Okay Hey, breaks done, I still don't feel up to typing though, oh well. So today at school, S.A.D.D. did this mock-car crash and it really was sad. A bunch of Seniors in the program faked their death, in front of all of us. I almost started crying. and this reporter from ch 3 news came, and talked to us, (not to kill the moment but he was really hot for an older guy)he mentioned how his mother was a recovering alchoholic, and him just talking about his life growing up around that, made me think of mine. It sucks. He also said "In high school I was a goof-off, I didn't need alchohol to make me act like an idiot" I kinda liked that, that's like me. I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to mess around with beer, cigarettes, or any of that shit. Dacia recently tried pot, and I'm not going to follow her down that road. I want somthing more than this town, no matter how cliche that sounds. My W. C teacher was talking about how she didn't fall to that peer-pressure shit, and that she wanted somthing out of life and that helped me decide, I am going to be better than my parents, and everyone else. I felt bad because she started crying she got very upset about this, because it brought back memories of past students killed because of drunk driving. I did all I could not to cry, it's so sad. But I think that demonstration really changed me, I looked around the bleachers, and hardly anyone was paying attention, people were laughing and making jokes. This was ment to open our eyes, and show us how much pain comes out of all this. The reporter, said this quote also... "A real man doesn't conform" I'm gonna follow that, exept change it to a girl. It's kinda funny because the whole rebeling thing was to drink alchohol, and now it's to not drink it. At least for me.

      I'm crying right now, I'm one of those people that can get extremely guilty. Okay so yesturday, Dacia said she had a dream where she smoked, I just got a spur of the moment thing and stole one of my dad's that was lying in a pack on the ground. I don't know aht came over me! So last night at 1 in the morning we smoked it. I feel so bad, I don't wanna grow up and act out like that, I still want to be a little girl. But I know I can't I can't tell my mom either, this is killing me, though it's so small a deal. I just feel so sick inside. I keep telling myself it's not a big deal, she did it in the 8th grade. I just feel really unsure of the situation. I just want it to end

So Monday, I'm going to carry my stuff after my first exam, and then once the second one is over I'm going to run out-side go to the bus I think is mine ask the driver if she goes to my road, and grab a seat before everyone else fills in.

But five or six bring you out to the car. Number nine with my head on the bar. And it's sad, but true. Out of cash and I.O.U's. I got you. Desperate desires and unadmirable plans. My tongue will taste the gin and malicious intent. Bring you back to the bar. Get you out of the cold. A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes. And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit. Who they'll kiss before they get home. I will lie awake. Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you'll fall for every empty word I say. Barely conscious in the door where you stand. Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands. You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute. I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do. And your hair smells of smoke. Who will cast the first stone? You can sin or spend the night all alone. Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold in the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone. You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start. If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart. Cause it's all you can be. You're a drunk and you're scared. It's ladies night. All the girls drink for free. I will lie awake. Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you'll fall for every empty word I say.  Jesse Lacy is my Fucking GOD!!! He's is so brilliant, and he's hot!!  Anyway, so today we had like a half day, because a spark or somthing for the school's electricity blew and there was a fire. Pretty cool, tomorrow we get year books, hot stuff...

Yeah, the only sport I've ever played was Cheerleading (Yes I consider it a sport. I've got a bunch of problems as a result)and there was softball in like 5th grade for like a day. So I'm gonna give this a try. I don't wanna be a dumb cheerleader, and I know I never could handle track, basketball, I think I've made like 10 hoops my whole life, I think I have pretty good hand-eye coordination, so I'm gonna give it a try.

      ( Great Romances of the 2oth Century-Taking Back Sunday ) Mood: really good  Hey, Today I saw my cousins, we went to see Shrek 2 wich was pretty funny, I wanted to see "The Day After Tomorrow" but, what are you gonna do? Jake Gyllenhaal is soooooooooooooooo hot! I saw Moonlight Mile yesturday, He is so awesome. I remember I first saw him in Bubble Boy, and then I fell in love with him, next I rented Donnie Darko, weird but hot, and so on.  Like I wanna ask some one out and, I'm feeling very assertive, but I was thinking about it, I don't think I'm really obsessed over anyone at the moment. Like I'm not gonna go after Chris, such a waist of years, and I like alot of guys at school (not that I sare this info with ANY friends) but I honestly don't think I like them enough to go that far. It's so frustraiting! But maybe that's what dating is, likeing someone a little, and going out and seeing if there is more, I think that's it. I don't know I'm so confused! So anyway next to the romance rut, I might be going to Florida this summer, and next summer I'm going for like 6 weeks! I'll still update here ofcourse. But my grandma wants me to volenteer at the hospital she volenteers at. I was born there so I guess that's cool. I could get a job down there too! Maybe if I'm lucky I'll meet someone. Well I guess I'll be going. Oh and like this year I've been doing things that I used to automatically say no to, like if there's a sleepover I wouldn't go because I didn't like the people there, I force myself to go and it's been really working for the better with me. Maybe I'll do this with my love life

      ( Vendetta Red ) Mood: Relaxing and pissed off  *sigh*, hes all ive been thinking about... If there is one person you can't stop thinking about, post this same exact sentence in your journal.   Okay now the reason I'm pissed is because, I just REALLY, REALLY started getting into Brand New, like past song #5, which I hadn't done when I first got it, and holy shit I was missing out, I just wrote them off as dreary and slow, but they are brilliant. They make all my other cd's seem like meaningless ramble. I'm in love with their writing, I can honestly say the cd changed me, opened my eyes. And to think that when "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" came out I hated him. So I'm becoming ubsesed with them, to the point that they are all that I listen to, and I bring it to Dacia's house so she can burn it and listen to it (not that she's worthy of this) and I accedently leave it there. That was a week ago, and when I ask her to bring it back to me she says, " Uhh it's not here, are you sure you didn't take it?" I remember leaving it in her sisters cd player. And now it's missing! I could cry, I love that cd so much!!! And now it's gone. I guess she could just burn me another one but, I want my original. I guess I should of made sure I grabbed it but, now she lost it. This sucks! I gotta do some make-up work and then I'm gonna watch "The Real World" I think I'm gonna cut my hair like Robin's... mabey not as short though...

      ( Nadda ) Mood: okay  I'm so excited that I'm going to Warped Tour!!! It's so kick ass!! My mom orderd the tickets and my aunt Debbie printed them out. I can not wait!! Taking Back Sunday, ugh! Yesturday I went to my grandma's work at the hospital (I was born there) and we went into the cafeteria and there was a really hot guy there, his name was Anthony, but he was wearing a hair net so that kind added a touch of nerdiness. And  he caught my eyes, and walked over to the register where I was and pretended to be interested in what the 30 year old Korean lady was ringing up for us. He looked like Jake Gyllenhaal, and I love Jake! Ugh!! too bad I'm NEVER gonna see him again. Unless... Warped Tour?

       Alkaline Trio - Radio     You've got a fire burning inside of you. Vengeful and bitter, you've been hurt in the past, and don't plan on forgetting it soon. This may seem like a bad thing, but really, you're just holding others to the same high standards you hold yourself. And when somebody crosses you, they'd better be ready for a storm. You may be in the habit of keeping negative feelings bottled up inside you, brewing up to a bursting point. Are all those grudges really directed at who you think they are, or is it just bad energy trying to break out of you? Getting angry is a natural part of the grieving process, and if it will help you move on, anger can help you. Just remember to move on once you're done.     urlLink                                                                              What's Your Theme Song?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Mark Hoppus: You will marry Mark Hoppus, you are interested in someone who is completly understandible, and will cheer you up whenever you feel down. !CONGRADULATIONS!     urlLink * What Blink-182 Member are You Going To Marry? *     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        The Star.    urlLink   * What Tarot Card Do You Represent? * (INCOMPLETE!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        FROZEN QUEEN/ KING You dont want love to come through to you. You like it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. You are already used to it. You say yourself that you dont need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you dont have time for these things. But in reality you are scared to get hurt. You feel save where you are: by yourself, nobody can hurt you there. You invent your own relationship in your dreams. You just need to know that you COULD get a partner. Thats it. PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!!

      ( The Union-Taking Back Sunday ) Mood:  I really want to be at a rock concert right now  Hey!!! Here is the first REAL update in forever!!!!  **The 2004 Vans Warped Tour-Jacksonville Fairgrounds, Florida** Okay, so kick ass!! I loved it!!  **Bands I saw/heard (in order):  *billytalent ( I heard one yell and I knew it was them)- I didn't see them perform, but walking around that was the background music  *Tiger Army- not too bad, I've never really gotten into them but the cello was kinda cool. Green and black zebra stripes  *Random bands that I don't know their name- pretty good music, I just wish I knew who they were  *Taking Back Sunday- OMFG. OMFG. What is there to say? Adam Lazzara is extremely... no words can possible describe. I loved it. He is sooooooo........ UGH!!!!! He does the whole shake side-to-side. He swings the mic... which is one of the hottest things I've seen a guy in a band pull off. and he whips it around his throught. They are just incrediblely awesome. The music kicks ass live. There is so much energy in Adam live and they just rock. Oh yeah! and so there's this girl back stage watching the band do their set and she's on the phone. This upsets Adam and he looks over at her and goes "Are you kidding me!? Your on the phone?" and the girl says something that the crowd can't hear. and he goes "Do you know how many people want to be in your position over there and your on the phone? Get off." and I'm not sure if he kicked her off the stage or not, but mid way through playing, at a lull in the song where it's silent he looks behind thye stage and yells "We stopped playing so you can leave a message now!" UGH that was so hot!! And later in between playing songs he askes "Did you get any more calls?" I am now in love with him.  *Melee- Okay I'm walking around and I see this kinda tall skinny guy playing keyboard and having some kinda... I don't know how to explain it. Smooth, soul, but not at all... I really don't know but it's intruiging. So I watch for a while listening to "The War" which is catchy. Then, after hearing that song and seeing them (not more than 17 people were watching them on the Hurly Stage), I knew I had to persue them. After their set, when they were paking up and there was like only 2 other girls off to the side my aunt (who brought me) was like "go talk to them!!" And I'm like "no, I can't!"  But finally I just told myself "just suck it up and go" so I walked over feeling in like another world, and right away the lead singer sees me aproching and walks up to me and I'm like "hi", and he says "What can I do for you?", So I make up a lame ass excuse of "Where is your tent?" and he goes "Ahh, it's REALLY far, all the way across, down yonder, so go straight down there and it's in a corner off to the side." And I politly say "Thank you, you guys are really good" and he says "thank you very much" I know it's hardly anything to brag about. But if you knew me this would be a great start. So back to the orig. topic... they were good go check them out.   I'll write more later I'm afraid the computer is gonna crash soon...
