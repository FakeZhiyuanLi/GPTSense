      Life is made up of dreams... Dreams make up a person. Without dreams, one becomes souless..  Dreams are also part and parcel of our lives... When we sleep we get dreams. And there's day dreaming also but won't talk about that... When we dream in our sleep, will those things happen in reality? Or some will say it'll be opposite in reality...  Then again...... Arghhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! My $250 gone just like that??? Hmm... What happened you might ask.   I was haing my afternoon sleep just now... Dreamt of THE 4 numbers that I always buy. The person inside my dream told me my luck is coming and ask me to go buy 24 permutations on that number.... I told my mom about it and she say won't be able to buy in cause some minister's birthday also got that 4 numbers and it's coming. So I didn't bother about it. Just a dream right??? But NO...... The four numbers really came up in tonight's 4D!!!!! ARGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! Should try to go and buy... My $250!!!!!!!   Oh never mind.. Forget it... No point in complaining anymore right? Ha....Anyway, those 4 numbers had won me a few thousand dollars last year.. Ha.. So ok la.. win some lose some.. :p  *sign*.... Everyday my shifu niam keng (hokkien for meditation)... Today twice.. Once in morning and another in the night. Having headache liao (Think of the Monkey King, Sun Wu Kong and the teacher who always mediate till his golden loop squeezes his head till he gets a headache..) By the way, if some of you are wondering, yes, that shifu is a gal but not my girlfriend. I'm still single and available. Ha.. She works in a pub (shall not name where just in case...ha) Quite pretty but everyday sms me to call me go down her pub to drink. Madness... If drink everyday, I'll have celebs visiting me very soon and I'll be on TV every few months liao.. Ha.. For those who don't understand, it's the NKF.. But that's another topic..ha.. And I got nothing against them.... Also didn't donate any just in case someday I need the money for dialysis myself.. Ha.. Hopefully not.. Ha.. Anyway, back to the story.. Arghhhh.... The pub gal's name is Grace (Give her a name so won't have to call her pub gal everytime. ha.. My 1st character intro??? ha..) Ok.. Gotta pei fu her for her persistency. Everyday without fail will sms me... Everyday headache without fail... Dunno how to answer her. Ha.. Maybe it's because I got soft spot for gals and dun like to see them sad ba... Ha.. Gals cry and I'll melt... Anyway, today also didn't reply her. 1st time... Ha.. Dunno what's the outcome... But that's another day... Ha....  &nbsp;

      Hmmm... Everybody has a 1st time.. 1st time learning to walk, 1st time in learning speech, 1st time in accepting gals as normal human beings.. ha.. 1st time in holding a gal's hands... 1st time in... Arghhh.. Never mind.. Unending 1st times... ha.. Anyway, this is my 1st time blogging. Dunno what to say. Just so bored that decided to blog to waste my time away.. Ha...  Anyway, welcome to my world of discus (aquarium fish that looks&nbsp;is round like a dish and not the metallic disc that people throw around. Dunno wat's the point in that...Ha)&nbsp;and cock ( I mean as in talking rot, not in the real thing. What are you thinking of??? Ha...Then again, wat am I thinking of??? Ha..) Who am I? I'm a ummm... self-absorbed, lying, flirting, rich&nbsp;bastard. Ha.. Nah.. Me just a normal sg guy who thinks that he's the smartest person in sg and that companies that do not employ him is losing a super workaholic genius and who won't mind anyone treating him bad cause heaven will punish them which is much worse. Ha..  And yes.. I'm unemployed now... Ha. Who wanna employ an engineering and finance genius??? Ha...I only look bo chap (a lot of my friends tell me that. But no choice mah.. Face given to me by parents.. Accept it loh...) but I'm productive and efficient to the point that I was sacked once cause I work too fast and always very free to walk here walk there. 1st time I heard people got sacked because of high efficiency. What's the world coming too!!!????!!!!  Sianz.. Nothing to do liao...Think go take afternoon nap liao. Ha...Blog later!~!
