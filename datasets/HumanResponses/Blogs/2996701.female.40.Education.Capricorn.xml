      Perhaps it would be beneficial to say something about myself, since I have subtitled this blog "The ramblings of a woman in her prime."  I have recently turned forty, and I am having some difficulty in coming to terms with that fact.  I don't mind getting older, per se, it's just that I don't  feel old.  You see, it took me until well into my thirties before I really grew comfortable with who I am.  I found the right job, the right mate, and I could not care less about what others think of me.  I have decided that other people should care more about what I think of them.  I am happy in my own skin, and it is very freeing.    I don't look forty, or at least that's what other people tell me.  I especially hear this from my students (I teach high school English), who often delight me with, "Gee, you're older than my mom, but you look and act younger."  I think this is largely due to the fact that I don't have any children of my own.  I tell my students that "I don't have someone like you sucking the life out of me at home."  I love my kids, but I also love that they go home to someone else.  Still, forty just seemed to come up and bitch-slap me.  I thought my life would be different than it is now.  I wanted to DO something with my life.  I think being a teacher is a great thing, but I always wanted to be a writer who wrote something meaningful.  I can come up with stories, but they seem pretty vapid to me.  Is it wrong to want to write something that will last, something that could change the lives of other people?  I can also see, by rereading this, that I will never be a good writer if I don't stay on topic.  I was going to say something about myself, but all I have said is that I am forty and I teach English.  Well, I am a woman, I live in the Midwest (or the "plain states", as others prefer), I have had several careers before I decided to become an English teacher.  After college I worked publishing newsletters for a trade association, became a lawyer, worked as an executive director of a non-profit organization, and THEN became an English teacher.  Of all the jobs I have had, I must say that being a teacher is the most personally rewarding, if not financially rewarding.  Besides my job, I love singing (it is my avocation), love movies, am addicted to television (particularly reality TV), read extensively, play computer games (the Sims), and am working on shedding some unwanted pounds.  I probably spend at least 20 hours per week on my computer doing one thing or another.  I am good at multi-tasking, otherwise I'd never get anything done.  As a person, I try very hard to be kind to others, especially young people.  I have little tolerance for much of the stupidity that I hear coming out of the mouths of adults, and I need to work harder on not rolling my eyes or just replying to them with some nasty retort.  I have found it isn't worth it.  I think I can be a funny person, and I do use sarcasm a great deal.  One administrator that I used to work with said that sarcasm should never be used in the classroom.  I guess I'll have to quit teaching, if that's the case.  My students know when I'm kidding, and I think they like me for not being the stereotypical teacher.  I have some weird quirks, one of them being that I tend to get obsessed over things or ideas and wrap myself in them for a period of time.  Right now, my obsession is the character Eomer from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I have a picture of him at school, as well as an action figure on my desk.  I refer to him as "my boyfriend."  My students think I'm insane.  Some of the boys get incensed and ask, "How can you call him your boyfriend?  What does your husband think?"  I tell them that my husband's girlfriend is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so he has no room to talk.  I am getting tired of writing.  Is it the fact that I am out of practice, or is it the two margaritas I drank earlier?  Only time will tell...

      I have finally given into the idea that I should write down my thoughts and musings, rather than just keep them in my head.  It amuses me that perhaps someone, somewhere would read them and think, "Damn! That is one savvy, yet slightly off-kilter woman.  I like the way she thinks!"    In reality, I just need some avenue to express myself, so this seems like the best way.  I aspire to be a writer, but I despise the physical act of writing.  Typing is much more satisfying, for some reason.  As an English teacher, I always encourage my students to write, yet I myself am abysmal about writing regularly.  I am hoping that this will force me to write, as I think there is nothing more pathetic than non-updated writings that just float around in the vast abyss of the internet.  So there you go...

      I'm readying myself for a weekend away with five friends from high school.  We're "celebrating" the fact that we all turn 40 this year, although one of us will be 41 next week, and another won't be 40 until September.  Still, it's a wonderful reason to get away from spouses and kids to shop, eat, drink, and gossip for three days.  I marvel that I have been friends with these women for well over 25 years.  Anyway, among the trinkets I'm putting together for the weekend, I have created a three-CD set of music from our youth, and I'm burning copies for everyone.  I've found almost four hours of music that are truly "blasts from the past."  Everything has to be before 1982, the year we graduated from high school.  I could have included more music, but I think it would have cost me more time and money than I care to spend.  As it is, I have spent hours on Rhapsody and Napster collecting these songs, and I still don't have some of the music I wanted.  I do think I have come up with an admirable sampling.  When I listen to some of the songs, it shoots me right back to definitive places and times when I heard them as a teen.  I can  remember riding in a van full of teenagers on a the way to a swing choir competition, dividing up the parts and singing  Black Water  by the Doobie Brothers as we drove through a snowstorm.  I remember the first time I heard  Point of Know  return by Kansas when I sat on the waterbed of the brother of my first boyfriend while he played it for me.  I vividly recall being in Jim Johnston's truck after he got off of work at the Goodrich Ice Cream Shop and listening to  Open Arms  by Journey, trying to figure out whether he liked me as a friend or "more than a friend."  I can see myself dancing with my friends to  You Better You Bet  by the Who and  Greased Lightning  from the  Grease  soundtrack.  The one song I really wanted was Amii Stewart's remark of  Knock on Wood , as I was always pummelled during dances with that song, my maiden name being "Wood."  Isn't it amazing how music has the ability to take us back to both good and bad places?  Whenever I hear  Mandy  by Barry Manilow, I always feel the sadness I felt about the death of our beagle Mandy who was hit by a car when that song was popular.  Hearing  She Bop  by Cyndi Lauper reminds me of my wild college days, and I can see myself at a bar grabbing this cute med students because I just "had to dance" - something that was totally out of character for me.  Thankfully, time is kind and most songs don't have the pang of negative emotion they once held.  I can listen to the  Glory of Love  by Peter Cetera and not feel sad about the stupid boy I was with when it was "our song."  I wonder if I will keep making "soundtracks", or am a relegated to the soundtrack of my youth?

      After this last weekend, I have come to have a new-found respect for motherhood or parenthood in general.  Sunday was my parents 45th wedding anniversary, and I planned a family gathering for them.  My brother couldn't come from Colorado, but my sister-in-law and two nephews (aged 6 and 3) came to stay with us.  My sister flew in from Delaware with my 10-month-old nephew as a surprise, even though she and her husband moved into their new house last Wednesday.  My other brother lives with my folks, so of course he was there, although his 11 month old son was not. (The mother of my brother's child is his ex-girlfriend, so he sees the nipper every other weekend.) My cousin and his wife came to the party with their 4 month old daughter, and my aunt and uncle came with their seven-year-old triplets.  It's been "kid central" at my normally "adult" house.  Quite frankly, I'm exhausted!  After several days of little boys running though my house, telling me "no", slamming doors, stomping through my flower beds, refusing to eat, having "accidents" and other miscellaneous child activity, I have come to the conclusion that those of us who do not have a child in the house all the time do not appreciate those who do as much as we should.  I tried to get my nephews to take a nap today while their mother was gone, which was a definite no-go.  Actually, I was the one desperate for a nap.  Zoo, Children's Museum, parks, just playing in addition to my regular stuff I need to do - how do parents with jobs do it?  I have deep admiration for them.    I also know that I would discipline my own children differently than my brother and sister-in-law.  My three-year-old nephew is so spoiled - they cave to his every whim.  He and I had a "come-to-Jesus" this morning after he threw a huge tantrum.  They have not introduced the whole "cause and effect" concept to him with any follow through.  For example, I said if you do not take a bath, you do not get Spiderman back.  He refused and  threw a fit.  You would have thought that taking him to another room to calm down was tantamount to killing him, listening to the way he screamed.  He did eventually calm down, but not after a battle royale between our two wills.  Sorry kid, I work with 9th graders - I'm going to win!  I think he won't be sad to see me go when they leave in the morning.  My uncle (father of the triplets) told me on Sunday how great it was to come to house where it was clean, tidy and crap wasn't all over the place.  I told him that he had three lovely people to care for him in his old age.  He told me he'd gladly give me one of the kids.  I had a momentary pang on Sunday, but now I think we made the right choice for us.  I DO adore my sister's little boy, who I call "Spud."  He is sweet, smart, and thinks his auntie is the most wonderful person in the world.  Perhaps we have a such a good relationship because he can't talk back to me yet.  Only time will tell.

      Ronald Reagan remains a source of controversy for many, but he was the president of my youth.  Perhaps I appreciated the office more when I was younger.  I used to work as the Executive Director of a state-wide non-profit and lost much of my youth idealism regarding government when I actually had to work with politicians.  I used to think that politicians were altruistic people who wanted the most good for the most people.  Now I have discovered that most politicians are just like everyone else.  I always thought they should be BETTER somehow.  Growing up is a hard thing...  Reagan was the first president I ever voted for.  Are there things in retrospect that I have problems with?  Sure.  Look at his lack of involvements in dealing with the AIDS crisis.  So many people died needlessly.  But the man did inspire confidence and patriotism, things that I have not felt since his presidency with any of his successors.  It's hard to think that my students have no idea about the fear that the Cold War gave us, and I am deeply grateful for that.  I did believe then, and still do to some extent, that Reagan wanted to become president for the greater good and not completely for own his self-glorification.  I wonder if I will ever feel inspired by another president in the same way?  I do feel sorry for Nancy Reagan.  What a horrible existence watching your beloved slowly fade away.  Ronald Reagan has truly been gone for years.  I only hope that some good will come out of this and people will see the need for research using fetal cells.  I doubt that the powerful right-wing, pro-life lobby will ever let this happen.  These folk make it ever so hard to be a moderate Republican.  One thing is for sure, I shan't be voting for George W. come November.

      I'm going to try for the third freakin' time tonight to add another post.  My first was witty and insightful, my second thoughtful and sincere, this one, well, I'm just crabby now!  It's my own fault that I can't follow directions and keep hitting the stupid "back" button, thus losing everything I've written.  I'd be thinking more clearly if I'd do this at another time, but the three cups of coffee I had at dinner have done a number on me.  I'll be lucky if I get to bed before 4:00 a.m.  Thank God for summer vacation.  My only plans for tomorrow are to "maybe" go see a movie.  They are changing to "definitely" taking a nap...  I had a delightful encounter with someone I met in a chat room tonight.  This person - I'll call him Kaspar - was caring and helpful and talked with me about some issues I hadn't talked about with anyone, but sorely needed to.  I deeply appreciated his advice.  It makes me miss having the males friends who have come and gone out of my life.  I haven't had any "man friend" to talk to since Mark drifted out of my like a few years ago.  I really value the advice that Kaspar gave me.  I will keep sending good thoughts his way.  I always marvel that the Internet provides a way for people who would otherwise never have met to connect with one another.  It's nice not to feel alone in this world.

      I have not written on my blog since my trip away with the girls.  We has a most excellent time - much shopping, laughing and eating.  Our biggest hoot came from finding the porn that driver's husband obviously keeps in their conversion van.  Although we didn't watch it, I'm sure the film  Black Pepper  will turn out to be a cinematic classic.  I have been a prisoner in my own house for the past few days as we wait for the delivery of finds from a mortgage refinance.  Everything that could go wrong with this process has gone wrong.  If I hear one more "the dog ate my homework" type of story from these people, I may kill myself, or, more likely, someone else.  Just give me my money!  The highlight of the week is the fact that my summer reality TV shows started on Tuesday.  Amazing Race and Big Brother both premiering on one night!  I was in heaven.  Thank God for the invention of TiVo.  I can get through my shows in a timely fashion and not have to watch the annoying commercials.    I know some people look down on me for the vast amount of TV that I watch.  I used to feel bad about this until I examined my life compared to others.  One, I read more than most people I know, so it's not like I don't do things to improve my mind.  Two, I consider myself a student of popular culture - I know what's going on in the world of entertainment, and I think that helps me related to MY students better.  In fact, I don't think that, I KNOW it.  Three, people who pride themselves on not watching TV often don't spend much time doing much else, because they are slow about doing everything.  I am generally multi-tasking while watching TV.  I can think of a friend that I have who doesn't watch TV, doesn't really read, doesn't do any volunteer work, he does go to many movies, but I would just like to know what else fills up his time? Maybe I don't want to know...
