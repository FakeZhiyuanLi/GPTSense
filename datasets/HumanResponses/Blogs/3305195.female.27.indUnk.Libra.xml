      My husband is in such a snit since he quit smoking.  The littlest things just send him over the edge and make him overreact.  I called him at work this morning to tell him what bills I set up on the internet to be paid, and to make sure I get as much of his check as possible to pay for them.  He doesn't even let me finish talking!  So....then he sends me an email, which is rare these days.  It says, all in caps and with no punctuation like he always writes, "I WAS BUSY YOU DO THE SAME THING SO DONT BE MAD AND ALL THAT"  Ok first of all, if I was a third-grader, I would still conclude that he needs to grow up after what he wrote.  Second of all, I am sick of the attitude in my household about money.  I got into it with the 16-year old the other day because she said, "I really think you are freaking out too much about the money."  I said, "You know, you're right.  I think I will quit freaking out about your cellphone bill and stop worrying about that pesky car insurance on your car.  And I won't burden myself with saving back money for the 20 times a week you ask for gas money when YOU HAVE A JOB."  That seemed to make her more angry.  She said I shouldn't worry so much about it.  Then she went into this speil about a couple at her church (we allow her to go to a different denomination than us) that was struggling with money, was once given $500 for an old junk car they had, and then decided to give the money to the church.  I explained to her that yes, giving has its place.  Tithing is something we do sporadically, when we have 10% to spare after fulfilling our household obligations (utilities, insurance, etc).  I can't believe she expects me to take financial advice from someone who has never paid a bill in her life and gets more expensive every day.  All I can say is that I am glad she did not come from MY genes.  She came from my husband, who is the most financially irresponsible person I know.  On one of his more intelligent days, he can at least admit that I am doing a good job with the family finances.  He always talks so much about how wonderful my Dad was.  But what he doesn't realize is that Dad was the best money manager I had ever known.  We thought we were poor growing up just because he didn't buy us everything we wanted.  But you know, we were just being BRATS.  He always had money in his wallet, we ate out often--whenever we wanted to, he put my mother (and us) through school and vehicles and whatever else.  As far as financial planning and good credit were concerned, he was a brilliant man--the exact opposite of my husband.  Thank God I was taught more from my Dad than him.    Anyway now that he isn't smoking, he's horrible.  It just makes my job at home harder.  It is Memorial Day weekend tomorrow....I am off work Monday, which doesn't happen often.  I should be thrilled to have a couple of "play days".  But no, I dread being in the house with grumpy bear and the screaming me-me's.  Ok that is WEIRD.  He just emailed me and says he wants to go to the drive-in movie with just me or play golf with me this weekend....we'll see if he sticks to that one.

      It looks like I convinced him it would not be worth another monthly payment to pipe in crap to our minds via the TV.  Thank God for that....  He actually told me last night that he is very thankful for how I am handling the bills.  It was kind of neat, really.  He said he has been bragging on how well I am doing.  That doesn't help my stress level though, considering that once I start paying for daycare (on my next check--they start daycare tomorrow) I really won't have much left over for bills.  Also, he's going to try (again) to quit smoking.  That kind of brings in a mixed-bag of emotions for me.  I am glad to know he is going to try again; but I am bracing myself for his temper.  He's never physically abusive, but I wouldn't say he's at all functional at home as a normal person either.  He will be in a perma-moody mode where he only speaks in one-word sentences (if there is such a thing) and is VERY easily provoked to anger.  By anger, I mean, watch out because something's going to get thrown.  I will just start praying for him NOW.  We had some pretty bad storms last night.  The power was out from 9:30PM or so all the way to 1AM.  I know this because I was the one awake with the battery-powered scanner listening to weather reports and local police working damage control.  That used to be my Dad's post.  He would have the radio on in the middle of the night while my mother snored.  KTTS, who employs the most paranoid personalities on the planet, would be blaring.  I think they actually had their own sirens that they played in their studio, just to add to the hysteria.  But they were good about getting tornado warnings across; so Dad would listen faithfully to protect the family from danger.  What does MY husband do??  SNOOOOOOORRRRRRREEEE.....I didn't feel safe at all.  I felt like I had to stay up all night just in case I had to get the family down to the creepy basement, which was probably flooding.  So now I'm at work, in the little metal building, zombified.  I can't help thinking that someday, after a good night's storms, I will drive to work only to find my work GONE--blown away.  Oh well....I guess that is the way things are.

      Yes, the subject is about my husband.  I can't understand why he would want to get satellite TV hooked up at our house.  We have been without any TV channels for about 2 years now; and it has been wonderful.  Our marriage improved by leaps and bounds when he stopped sitting in front of the TV every night until he fell asleep in his chair.  The kids stopped fighting so much and their grades improved (one of them realized she had TIME to study without the TV sucking her in all the time).  His argument is that we already spend around $50 per month on renting/buying movies.  True--but if he would just stop doing that and READ A BOOK, it would serve us all better.  I hate the movies he watches, and they certainly aren't appropriate for the kids.  So he is spending that $50 on himself.  (If he would crack his Bible once in awhile maybe he would have an ounce of conviction too, but that would hurt too much I guess.)  And then there is the 14-year-old that has decided he will be a smoker.  Does my husband really think it is a great idea to give him a myriad of things to watch all day every day this summer while he's off school (hardly any of which we would approve of his watching anyway)????  That prospect does not seem to bother him, in light of the almighty sci-fi channel being available to him EVERY NIGHT.    At least on the VCR/DVD player there is a "STOP" button.  When I talk to him, he stops whatever he is watching and pretends to listen (he still does not respond, but even chimps can do that, so there is hope he can learn).  With TV, he will either grunt, as if to acknowledge he heard a noise, or he'll yell at me to shut up.  That kind of interaction really does wonders for a marriage.  I can see that if he is determined to stay on this track, things will go downhill fast, despite my trying to hold things together.  So he says to me, "It's ONLY 29.99 A MONTH!!!!!"  I'm sitting here at my desk rolling my eyes, wondering how dumb a person has to be to not read the fine print.  I guess, again, that is my job, so I pull up the website.  It looks like there are all kinds of fees for all kinds of reason in the fine print.  Not to mention that you are required to sign a 12-month agreement and give them your credit card number so they can charge it whatever they wish every month.  No way, no how, will I give any company my credit card number.  My card is actually a mastercard debit card, which means it doesn't "charge", it deducts from my checking account.  Not a chance--does he think I am a moron?  Maybe I *am* a moron.  Maybe he is right and we should just make butt-prints in our chairs every night and fill our minds with garbage.

      Saturday was ok, I guess.  At least that was salvaged.  My 16 year old stepdaughter and my husband wanted to switch the living room to the dining room and vice versa.  It looks very nice.  To keep out of their way, which is what my 3 year old daughter and I needed to do, I took her to Springfield to wander around the mall.  It was boring, but at least we were out and not sitting at home.  Then she was hungry, so I took her to Pasta House, which is one of my favorite haunts.  She was a good girl.  She got hardly any of her spaghetti on her.  When the dessert tray came around, she demanded strawberry shortcake.  I tried to explain to her that they didn't have that; and the waiter pointed out that they DID have it--they had just gotten it.  So....she came away happily with a full belly and strawberry on her face.  Then yesterday....ugh....I took a pretty good nap yesterday, which felt great at the time.  But then I couldn't sleep last night--lovely.  The worst was last night when we caught my 14 year old stepson smoking in his bedroom upstairs.  Keep in mind that my little 6 year old son's room is right down the hall from his.  I was furious.  How stupid did he think we were???  We could smell it all the way downstairs.  Any idiot would know that if you don't want to get caught smoking you at least don't smoke in the same HOUSE as the people you don't want to find out.  The worst thing to me was not so much the smoking as the lying.  All those times we found lighters up in his room he lied to us, letting us think he just had a thing for playing with fire (which, if you knew the kid, is entirely believable).  He has been smoking after all, which was MY first accusation long ago.  I also believe he stole the cigarettes from my husband's shop, where my husband had hired him to wash vehicles (he fired him last night, by the way).  He has a history of just taking things he wants without regard to who's they might be.  He told us he just found them in the street, which is an excuse he overuses.  He has "found" so many things "in the street" and now I don't believe a word of what he says.   A mother of two small children should not have to consider these kinds of problems.  She should be able to raise her children without exposing them to these things.  I cried for about an hour last night after a brief spat with my husband about the issue.  He smokes, so how is he supposed to convince his idiot son that smoking is BAD.  Then again, how am I supposed to convince my two babies that it's BAD.  I stood in my little daughter's doorway last night and watched her sleep.  I think that was the real trigger of the tears.  I want so much for my little ones that I can't give them.  I wanted to just leave last night.  I love my husband, but last night it just didn't seem worth it.  I guess sometimes we are fortunate in life that there are no "easy ways out"; or we would walk our own path to ruin.  I just hope things can turn around.  I pray that today is a much better day.

      I think I may finally be able to take a couple of classes at the local community college.  I've signed up for Public Speaking and American Government in the fall as night classes.  I just filled out my financial aid form this morning and will be mailing the signature form tonight.  It turns out that if I make an A on those classes, my employer will reimburse me 75% of my out-of-pocket costs, which I am hoping will be low anyway, because of federal aid.    Mark interviewed for a job on Saturday with a trucking company between Quincy and Macomb.  It would be 3rd shift work as the shop supervisor and starts out at 45000.00 per year.  Honestly, it doesn't sound half bad.  I think he has a much better shot at this one than the job he applied for in Bloomington.  I actually hope he gets it.  I guess if it in God's plan for us, that door will be opened and the opportunity will reveal itself.    I had another argument with my mother over the gay marriage issue last night.  Thankfully, this one was a short argument that I ended quickly because my children were in the room.  (Thank God for children!)  I keep telling her I don't understand how she can call herself a Christian and support the view that gay marriage should be allowed.  She keeps trying to tell me that the Bible isn't clear on the subject and that "Jesus practiced tolerance", which tells me that she does not understand my position on the subject.  For example, when Jesus addressed the situation of the woman caught in adultery, yes, his stance was, nobody is without sin and has the right to judge someone else based on their sin.  However, what did he say to her after her attackers disbanded???  He said "go and sin no more".  It is as simple as that.  We are to treat everyone with the love of Christ (which is difficult in itself) but not AGREE with what they are doing.  We condemn the sin and not the sinner.  My mother keeps trying to turn it around and say I am condemning gays, which I am NOT.  I am condemning homosexuality though, which God called an abomination in his infallible word.  Ok.  Enough sermons on that subject today.  I have other beefs with my mother.  I guess it is a good thing I love her, eh?  I remember once right after my husband and I were married, overhearing a conversation between her and my brother about how Mark and I would last only a year, if that.  What a bunch of hooey.  My Dad loved my husband like a son.  They sat in Dad's garage for hours every time we visited.  Sometimes I think she was just jealous of the relationship they had.  She has seen me as a failure ever since I dropped out of college in 1997.  Not much that I have done since then has been good enough.  And then when Dad died in 2000 of cancer, I felt like I lost my best advocate and biggest fan.  I know he would be proud of me for parenting my kids and stepkids, taking on a full-time job (when I would have rather stayed home with my small children) to help Mark pay the bills and support the kids, and for sticking to my dream of going back to school, no matter how long it takes.  (He would also have disagreed with my mother's ultra-liberal feminist views, which is a thought that brings a grin to my face.    Well, I do actually have work to do, so I had better get to it.

      I just had a salesperson "job shadow" me this morning to see why how she does things is important to our department.  She didn't know half of what we do.  It was pretty interesting I guess...  I also had to find a tactful way of telling her what she had been doing that was not quite done correctly.  It seemed to go alright.  My husband has this elaborate plan for a date this weekend.  I hope our 16-year-old will not decide she can't babysit for us.  We don't get our enough by ourselves; and honestly I'm easy to please in the way of dates.  I just wanted the standard dinner and a movie.  We will probably "negotiate" for a half-hour or so about what movie to see, but in the end, it will just be nice to be together with NO CHILDREN!!!  And he actually said he would take me to Vic's Pizza for dinner, which also happens to be a Pasta House chain restaurant, and my favorite place to eat.  So that will be nice.  I'm getting my hopes up that all will go well, which is something I don't usually do.  I'm just telling myself it will be wonderful--and then maybe it will.  (He's a pretty good guy--I have no reason to doubt really.)  I wrote him a really impressive (or so I thought) cover letter last night outlining the reasons they ought to hire him for the job he wants (and I don't want him to have).  It took a lot of strength for me to not just blow it off, since I don't want him to get hired there.  But that isn't me anyway.  If I write something (with the exception of my journal or blog) it had better be good--that is the way I feel about it.  He was very happy with the letter, and that is what counts.  If he had written it, there would be no punctuation, it would be in all caps, and there wouldn't have been a complete sentence in the whole thing.  That is the way he sends me email--like he is screaming a bunch of sentence-fragments all squished together to me (like angry babbled nonsense).  He means well, anyway.  What a guy!

      I just can't seem to get "inspired" today.  I don't have a whole lot of work here on my desk; and I need to save some of it for tomorrow.  Tomorrow morning one of my Salespeople will be here in my cubicle job shadowing me to see why it is important they do things the way the AR Department wants them done.  I don't think it will do a whole lot of good, honestly.  So I am a little frustrated with trying to find good examples of things to show her.  And then there are my kids.  I know when I pick up my little ones (ages 3 and 6) from school they will not want to leave; because of a picture that did not quite get finished or time at the school's computer that had not been used up yet.  Then they will fight over who's the "leader"; and the one who gets to the van last (besides me, who they will both beat to the van) will try to hurt the one who got there first.  The will bicker and fight with each other all the way home, or at least until I threaten to send them to their rooms and they start fighting with ME instead.  Then when I get home with the bicker-boxes, the two lovely teenaged stepchildren will not have done any chores and either have gone somewhere without permission, which infuriates me, or will be sitting around doing nothing.  Not to mention that the 16 year old girl will be in one of those "moods" where she hates everyone, especially my husband and I; but she won't tell us what is the matter because "it doesn't matter".  (Can you see me rolling my eyes here?)  She once told us that we must not care about her because we work too much.  We both have dayjobs and are required to work some overtime.  He works until 6 usually and I generally get home about 5.  But we must not care because we choose to work...choose...that's hilarious, really.  And then there is time.  It just goes too darned fast.  I get up at 4:30 to get the little kids ready for school before I leave for work; I work all day; I get home around 5 and throw something frozen in the oven and bathe the little kids; and before I know it, I'm up entirely too late to feel rested the next morning at 4:30.  There is just no time to have a life at all, it seems like.  Of course, last night my 6 year old son brings home a paper from the teacher saying he has two books our that he borrowed on 4/5/04 for the "book-it" program.  I have never heard of these books in my life and now I am supposed to find them in the house that eats everything.  Lovely.  So it looks like I will be paying for them.  I'm not sure.  I meant to send a note with my boy about it to school today, and of course, like everything else, I forgot.  Then there is my church.  My husband quit going because from the first Sunday he ever missed, no one has called on him to see if he was ok and tell him they missed him at church.  My first thought was, "ok...that's just dumb.  He should be there regardless of whether or not the deacons and the preacher do what they are supposed to do."  But then little things started to annoy me.  The pastor's wife has a lack of tact that would amaze anyone.  She says the most insulting things to people without realizing it.  I'm not sure it is her fault, because I don't think she knows she is hurting people.  (I won't get info specifics here right now.)  Every time I talk to her though, it ends up being a horribly upsetting experience.  So I have just stopped trying to speak with her at all.  They stopped having childrens' church during the service; so now I wrestle my two little ones by myself.  I hear none of the sermon at all because I am too busy taking kids to the bathroom downstairs, hushing them during the service, trying to entertain them, and letting them wallow me, which makes it impossible to even read the scripture once that the pastor is talking about.  (There is where I fault my husband for not at least coming for THAT reason.)  I have been told over and over at church that they want me to play trumpet again, yet no one, not even after I tell them why I can't, offers to sit with my children during the service.  It would not even be the WHOLE service that I would need someone.  They would be freed for the sermon.  I miss the other churches that I have grown up in and been a member of in college.  Those were churches that were gracious to you, always happy to see you (or very convincing actors), anxious to develop your spiritual gifts, etc.  Now that we have moved to this dinky little town, there are no churches like that around in the denomination that I want to be in.  It is so frustrating.  And because I have lost the good experience of being a part of my church, I feel like my spiritual well has just gone dry.  I wish there was an answer.

      .....he wants me to write a cover letter for him and proofread his resume tonight so he can apply for this job out of town that I don't want him to take.  I guess that makes it easy, now doesn't it?    Actually, I don't think he has a shot at it.  He is the Service Manager at a small GM/Caddy dealership right now.  He LOOKS like a Service Manager.  They don't want an auto-technician-type for this F & I Executive position.  They want a Sales or other *clean* executive type.  My husband does not own a suit.  His idea of dressing up is khaki pants and a polo short--untucked over his protruding gut.  Yeah.  That just SCREAMS executive.  He might get to an interview, and that will be it.  So I guess I don't have anything to worry about.    I didn't want him to go back to turning wrenches either; and now that he has a bad leg injury that will effect him the rest of his life, I don't see him getting a job as a high-paid tech again anyhow.  He needs to stick with Service Management in dealerships--or something else that is primarily a low-impact job for him.  Ok.  It is time for lunch--off to the Tastee Treat.

      Ok...so my darling husband is sick of his job--I am sick of his job as well.  But does he have to look for something new that is more than an hour away from home?  We are stuck in a contract-for-deed house where the previous owner has been trying to get rid of us since the start.  His current employer (at an auto dealership) CO-SIGNED on the loan for our van, so I would have something to drive to work; and so the family would have a car that all 4 kids and he and I would still fit in.  I'm in the middle of a bankruptcy that has not yet quite been discharged yet (crossing fingers).  I have FINALLY caught the bills up from his fiasco of trying to pay bills himself.  (This is the first time they have been paid on time for the almost-5 years we have been married.)  I dream of going back to college full-time, being off school when my children are off (for the most part) and enjoying having goals to reach for again.  I would love to make something of myself--not that being a mom and working to support the family is not important, mind you.  But the idea of him applying for jobs outside our "home area" is ridiculous.  What is he THINKING??  Does he think the bills for TWO HOUSEHOLDS will just pay themselves on time?  Does he think our house will sell in this dinky little town in less than FIVE YEARS?!?  Does he think the insurance people and our contract seller will just smile and say, "how nice!" when they realize the house is vacant????  It's foolishness...  He just wants to move there because his friend from high school that he recently reunited with lives there.  It is the same town he went to high school in, incidentally.  His friend just "dropped in" with his family this past weekend with no warning and stayed until 10:30PM.  My house was a wreck--the teenagers had not done their chores in a week--and I had not even had a chance to take a shower before his wife and kids were dumped on me.  (He and his friend decided to go running around; and then they went fishing, leaving me with the awkwardness of talking to his wife in my messy house and trying to keep her little baby from getting into the jungle that is my living room.  His friend takes way too much advantage of his wife.  He hates babysitting the kids and takes an extreme conservative view on what HER role should be.  I just think if we moved there, I'd never get a date alone with my huband again.  He would be busy with his friend every weekend and then they would want to go on double-dates any time I can find a sitter.  I hate double-dates.  Maybe I would like them if I had all the time in the world to spend alone with my husband.  Our alone moments are precious and few.  He will start to think like his friend...and our marriage will really suffer.  So...ok...enough ranting for now I guess.

      So I have to give up taking classes, again....the first time, a couple of years ago, it was because the red-headed stepchildren moved in.  I sacrificed then.  Now it is because, since I have a job, I qualify for a whopping ZERO in financial aid.  The tuition is due right around property tax time, and still in the season of ridiculously high-cost summer daycare.  So there is no way I can come up with the $354.....and that is just the tuition, I'd have to pay for books too, of course.  I thought about checking into taking out a personal loan, but my husband has already taken out FOUR that I am trying to pay on.  And then there is the small matter of my just-discharged bankruptcy, which probably wouldn't let it be possible anyway.    I mentioned the problem to my mother in an email this morning.  She will tell me to quit feeling sorry for myself.  She'll say that SHE feels bad for me, but that is what mothers do--they sacrifice.  Maybe I am being selfish here, but when my husband ENCOURAGES me to take the classes, and then I can't afford it.  Yeesh.  It makes me wonder if he wasn't setting me up, knowing I wouldn't qualify for aid; he wasn't worried about me being busy two nights per week in the fall because he knew it wouldn't happen.  Sure.  Just mess with my emotions--that's fair, I guess.  And then there is my mother, who paid my brother's bills when he left his wife and moved into the old homeplace (after Dad died and Mom "moved on up" to a better neighborhood), which is another gripe of mine entirely, for another blog entry entirely.  If it was HIM who was not able to afford to take a couple of classes to get HIM that much closer to a college degree, she would pay it in a heartbeat, no questions asked.  But me, no.  She will tell me I was selfish for wanting to do anything for myself.  She, who now has a masters degree in Social Work because while we were in elementary school she was getting her bachelors; and before my first son was even weaned off the bottle she was graduating with her masters.  She is telling me about sacrifice while I remember her not being home when we got home from school EVERY day.    If only I could afford to quit my job and just go back full-time.  I could get aid if I quit my job.  And now that my kids ARE in school, I could have days off when they are off....and summers with them as well.  No more daycare costs, because I would take all my classes in the morning when possible.  I would be home before they got off school.  That would be so great.  Not only that, but if I went to Western IL University full-time, I would be done in little more than 2 years.  I would have a degree...then if I stayed in longer I would have a masters in 3 more or so after that.  I could get a better job that I actually enjoyed.  I could pay for MY kids to go to college.  The way it is now, I'm not sure how we will ever pay for Christina's college....unless I am going too and they really give us a lot of aid.  She graduates in two years.  I don't have the luxery of getting my bachelor's before I have kids in college like my mother did.    I was so dumb quitting school the first time.  I kick myself for that.  Education is so wasted on the young.

      Yesterday, I called my husband to talk about something; and he tells me his friend Daryll is going to come look at a shop building with him.  I really thought we were done with these delusions of grandeur.    We don't have enough money to pay all the bills on time and still put any at all into savings, yet he wants to start his own business.  And this idiot friend of his that he went to high school with (who lives two hours away, I might add) is encouraging him!!  I know how my husband's mind works....he will try to get a loan, then when they laugh him out of the bank for his credit record, he will reinstate the loan I paid off last month!  Or, he will just expect it to come out of the household budget.  Heck, we don't need utilities--lets rent a shop building 30 minutes away instead!  And then there is the time issue.  He has none.  He works 70-plus hours per week now at his REAL job.  We hardly see him at all.  He still gets screamed at where he works because there isn't enough time to do everything that they have put under him.  So last night, I suggested we take a couple of hours at a local restaurant and hash out the issue.  He tells me that his best mechanic where he works wants to work for him; and that the Schwan's people (who's trucks he works on now) as well as some other big accounts told him they would take their business to him instead of where he works now if he opened a shop.  He said that he wouldn't take time away from me and the kids, because he would be taking it away from where he works now.  (I see him getting fired eventually, him with the attitude of "who cares, I have my own shop"--and then it will be much harder for him to ever work for anyone else again.)  He told me the money issue is the only thing he has not gotten figured out yet.  That is all he would tell me.  I got conflicting reports from him now on whether the reason his friend is coming this weekend is to look at that shop building or not.  He was holding to that story until I sent him an email telling him this whole thing was an unwise idea.  Now he says he forgot why Daryll is coming.    I even asked him if his wife and kids were coming and if I had to entertain them.  He said he wasn't sure.  Well that's great.  I think I will just go do something myself on Saturday and not be home to find out.  I need to think of something to do I guess.  Why can't he just look for a better job and be satisfied working for someone else?  Normal people have jobs and bring home regular paychecks.  They pay off their houses, they put their kids through college.  That is how it is supposed to go.  But because of his poor decision-making, we're going to be in financial ruin before he's done.  This whole issue is foolishness!  Our house will be paid off in 2-3 years if we would just leave things the way they are.  But noooo....he has to take on more debt the minute we get some bills paid on time.  If he goes out and gets another loan, I will be really hacked off.    The worst thing about this is that he gets angry with me for telling him why I think it is a bad idea right now.  It's like he doesn't care what I think, he'll just do what he wants anyway.  I think he really believes he won't be hurting me and the kids.  It's the same mentality he has always had about money and debt--that it just doesn't matter how much debt you have, because no one will get you for it in the end.  Well, he told me that for years...then I was sued and forced into bankruptcy by my creditors.  He was served papers just last night by the sheriff because he was being sued by the hospital for some old medical bills.  That alone should have been a sign to him.  I asked him if he thought they would garnish his wages after getting a judgement; and he said, "no...they won't do that!"  I know for a fact they will.  It will only take a couple of months, if the court's schedule allows.  Its like he doesn't care...or he thinks he is untouchable.  He's crazy.  He should be seeking God in this; but he is increasingly self-seeking.  I guess I need to get some knee pads and get started praying hard that God puts obstacles in his way so he can't do this to his family anymore.

      I got a call from my Mom last night saying that my Grandma (on my late Father's side) had a mild stroke.  Physically she is ok (for someone that is 87 years old); but they found her at the neighbors' house demanding to know why she was there.  She told them she did not live there, that she lived on Horstmeier Road.  She has not lived on Horstmeier since I was in college....that was before I had my kids...before Dad died, etc...  She has lost her short-term memory.  So...I guess if they make it to my cousin's wedding she won't know my kids anymore.  Try explaining THAT to your 4 and 6 year olds..."Hey kids, you remember great-grandma Cantrell?  Well she doesn't remember YOU."  And stupid me....I cried most of the way to work this morning thinking about having to explain to her where Dad is.  My Aunt and Uncle are trying to find a place for her and Grandpa.  He is in poor physical health these days and has barely talked at all since Dad passed.  He smiles at my kids, hugs and tickles them...but he won't talk much at all.  She can't take care of him anymore by herself...she can't even remember when to take her own meds...much less when he should take his or who's meds are who's anymore.  So they are going to try to find some assisted living...something where they still feel like they are somewhat independent, but aren't cooking their meals or messing up meds.  It kind of puts a bummer on my day...I really didn't need to start my week that way either.

      Not a whole lot of exciting things since my last post...  My son is in Missouri with my mother for a 3 week visit.  We dropped him off a little over a week ago.  Last I heard, he is being spoiled beyond belief, which is what Grandmas are for, I guess.  We pick him up the weekend of the 17th.  He won't want to leave.  Although, my four-year-old daughter called him the other night and said "I wan you to come hoooome".  So...maybe he will be ok with his adoring sister fawning over him.  (Or not.)  My husband is still looking for a better job.  His newest angle is that, since he is on salary where he is and gets no overtime (though he works long days seven days per week) he should put in an application where I work for driving a forklift or something out in the warehouse--or working in the garage here, since he has quite a bit of diesel experience.  He was going to put in an app online today.  We will see.  If he switched jobs, he would still need to pay his employer back for the loan (I am so embarrassed that he did this) he asked them for and got from them back in 2001.  He recently asked them for more....and when I squaked about it, he asked me "whose side I was on".  Yeesh....you can't ask your employer for money.  That looks sooo bad.  And we were doing just fine.  I have all his loans and the household bills on time.  So...he is just upset over not being able to overspend, I think.  I'm caught up at work...which will probably last through tomorrow.  And then we will be pounded by huge amounts of checks here in our office.  That also means tons of deductions to try to resolve.  And Friday is the last day of the period, which means a deadline for getting those done (noon that day).  So for today and tomorrow we're picking our noses; and then Wed-Friday noon, we will be pulling our hair out.  I SO would love to quit my job and go back to school!!!  I've started going to a huge Church in Jacksonville (about 45 minutes from home).  My husband has made it clear that he was unhappy with the Beardstown church and won't go back; so I figure I will keep trying places until he finds one he will go to.  And if he stops going at all, I will take the kids and go wherever the kids and I are happy.  No sense neglecting our faith just because he pushes his own away.  See?  I told you nothing was going on.
