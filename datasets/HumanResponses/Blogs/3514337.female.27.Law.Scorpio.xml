      This forum's purpose should be obvious - it's for people who want to get their creative juices flowing.  Hopefully "writer's block" will just be the name of the forum and not a description of the state of its members.

      The title of this forum is self-explanatory.  I personally love to cook, and I've been getting better and better at it.  I also just planted an herb garden for the first time this year.  The herbs are doing well, though an incredibly fast-growing moonflower demolished my dill and is now threatening my tarragon.  I replanted some dill and Dad cut back the moonflower, so I think the tarragon will be okay.

      I must admit I was reluctant to even create a forum devoted to political discussions, as I know we are a family of diverse opinions in that department.  But I know it's a popular topic, so go for it.

      I read the old saw about choosing the lesser of two evils. That has been euphemistically true of certain past elections, but this is the first election of my lifetime where we really will have to choose not to vote for true evil. America has been fortunate in this way that no matter how ignorant and stupid we are, our vote would not truly change America fundamentally. We would continue to argue our politics among the family in a spirited and loving manner even laughing over our differences because we are family and really don’t disagree fundamentally. That has changed over the past four years, but I hope not for long.   I have many friends who call themselves Republicans and many others who call themselves conservatives. Many of them are unhappy with the current state of affairs, but they say that they find it difficult to vote for  urlLink John Kerry  because he’s a liberal. Republicans have done a masterful job over the years of tainting the word “liberal” and creating myths about their stewardship that frankly don’t hold up under scrutiny. In another forum, I will write about why the Republicans have always been weaker on the economy, on defense, on crime, on the environment, and on morality. Today I will share the answer I give to my conservative friends who cannot stomach voting for a liberal.  Let’s set aside our political biases and look at these two men running for president. Each man has lived a life filled with the special privileges that come with wealth in America. Each went to Yale University and even belonged to the same fraternity. During the Vietnam conflict, one chose to join his state’s national guard, and there is still a huge mystery over whether or not he fulfilled his commitment with them. The other chose to volunteer to go to Vietnam where he became a decorated war hero. When he returned home, he had the courage to speak out about the wrongness of a war that he personally witnessed and participated in. I agree that it would be hard to stomach voting for the latter.  The first man was a cocaine addict and alcoholic who failed at everything he attempted. He is a man of his convictions because he never changes his mind and never admits that he’s wrong. He has accepted God who speaks to him regularly and tells him what to do just like those extremist Islamic Al Qaeda terrorists. This is the same man who stood before a group of wealthy donors and said in front of cameras, “They say you are the elite. I say you are not the elite, I call you my base.” The other man is intelligent and thoughtful and considers the nuances and complexities of the issues to a fault. This certainly puts him at a disadvantage when speaking to simple-minded Americans, but he exhibits flexibility in his thinking, and I can identify with this because I have changed my thinking many times over the years on the issues. This is what thinking people do. He is a Catholic but refuses to walk any religious line. He understands that separation of church and state is a foundation of America. He uses his wealth, power, and intelligence to help disadvantaged people.   I don’t see this election as a choice between the lesser of two evils, not this time. This election will be a clear cut choice between good and evil. It will also be a statement to the world one way or the other about what America is. I am deeply disturbed that this decision will be a very close one. It should not be that close. The American people need to show the world that we are a good, decent people who truly believe the words of Christ and Jefferson and don’t just use them to take what we can for ourselves.  I urge you all to open up your minds to what is going on. Try to remember what Christianity and America really stand for, and reject the neoconservatives who currently rule and are destroying what is truly great about America.

      Dustin and I went to Clarksburg over the weekend to see our newest family member, Minah.  She is super cute.  I am thrilled to say that I witnessed Brian changing a diaper.  We all spent a lot of time just looking at Minah waiting for her to do something.  She slept a lot.  At Paula’s, Nathan grilled up some steaks (delicious) on their new grill and Dustin, Nathan, Michelle (Nathan’s girlfriend), and I played “Cornhole,” a game where you try to throw beanbags into the hole of a wooden contraption.  (I’m sure there’s a more official name for this game, but I kind of like the  urlLink Beavis & Butthead -ish name.)  I played truly horribly at first, then started redeeming myself just as it began to get dark outside.  I had a request to remove all of the photos from this main page, since they can now all be viewed in the photo gallery.  I can’t do this because the photos in the photo gallery are linked to the original posted photos.  (Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I can’t really explain it any better than that.)  The way the blog works, new postings appear at the top of the page, moving everything down on the page.  This allows you to read the most recent material first.  The main page displays seven days of postings.  Older postings are archived each month.  Right now, we only have five days of postings (well, six days after this post).  So the more we post, the faster stuff will be moved off of the page and into the archives.  So let’s write!  I think maybe the best thing for posting tons of photos all at once would be for me to just put them in the photo gallery.  If people want to post just a few photos at a time, that’s fine, but for a large volume of photos, just e-mail them to me and I can put them in the photo gallery.  Then I can just add a posting that lets people know there are new photos to look at.  (By the way, there’s an article about weblogs in the most recent issue of Time.  You can check it out  urlLink here .)

      I have added a photo gallery.  Just click on " urlLink Photo Gallery " at the right to see what we have so far.  I know that everyone is still trying to figure out how the heck this blog works, but I hope that once the kinks are worked out it will be fairly effortless to use.  If anyone still hasn't received an invite, let me know.  Oh, there is one more annoying wrinkle...I have to invite everyone to each individual forum.  First just sign up for the main Hughes blog, and then I'll send you invites for the special forums.  Enjoy the photos!

      In addition to this main page, I have added a few forums where people can discuss specific topics.  You'll see links to them in the right-hand column under "Special Forums."  I tried to think of a few topics that I know people like to discuss often, so there's the  urlLink Cooks & Gardeners  forum,  urlLink Critical Mass  (for critiquing movies, books, music, etc.), the  urlLink Political Arena , and  urlLink Writer's Block  (for poetry, stories, etc.).  I figure this will keep things organized so there isn't just one long discussion of random topics all on one page.  Of course, any general discussions that don't fall into these special categories can be posted on the main page.  If anyone can think of other forums I should add, just let me know.

      Hello everyone.  Some of my college friends just started a blog so that we can all keep in touch and share photos, etc.  I realized this would be the perfect format for a new generation of the Chronicle.  I hope you'll agree.  I'm new to this, but so far it seems pretty simple.  I think I have to invite everyone to become members of the blog, then we can all post messages.  There are lots of different things we can do with this blog.  It's kind of like the Chronicle without the deadlines!  Once you create an account, you can post messages yourself whenever you want.  In other words, it doesn't have to go through me first.  Then, once a message is posted, other people can post comments just by clicking on "Post a comment" at the end of the post.  We can also post photos.  This requires a program called " urlLink hello ," which you can download for free.  (Just click on the word " urlLink hello " and you will magically be transported to the site where you can download the program.)  It's fairly self-explanatory, though it can be a bit confusing at first.  If it's too confusing or you don't want to download the program onto your computer, you can always e-mail any photos to me, and I can post them for you.  We can also create links to all kinds of things.  I have already created a link to the map of Michael's sailing trip (see right).  Links over on the right have to be created by me, but you can put links within your own postings (like I did with "hello").  I created this blog at  urlLink www.blogspot.com  completely for free.  While I created it, of course any and all suggestions are welcome.  The sky's the limit.  Let's blog!
