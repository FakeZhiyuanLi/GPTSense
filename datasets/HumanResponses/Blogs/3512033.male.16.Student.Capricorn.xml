       one week of school left before holidays! wooohooo! and i have most of monday off thanks to a chemistry excursion to the aquarium. not long before i finally get some rest... not likely...ahaha..  anyway... went back to footy training on thursday night, and i think the club must have known i was coming back, because they organised us to go on a nice long 10k run, with motivational videos included... fun fun...  anyway, if the EFL (the league my club is in) doesn't mind me wearing a glove during the game, i think i will be fine to make a return to the competition.   well, enough about that, its kinda really boring.   i spent most of today doing homework, encased by the foul weather outside... damn i hate winter...  u know what else i hate... the state of this blog recently... my frequency and standard of post has really dropped over the last week (not that they were any good in the first place)   and no... i havent done anything about my new layout....  you know what... seeing that this blog is so crap... i wont even bother with a conclusion...  take that english teacher!

       Hmmm… Looks like I’m in trouble…  My parents got home today from their weekend trip away… and my dad noticed that I’d done some of the washing… I hope that doesn’t mean that they’re going to expect it…. Oh well… they’re not getting it anyway… mwahahahaha!  These blogs of mine lately… they’ve been getting kind of crap…  I guess this one ain’t an exception ‘coz I still can’t find myself anything interesting to talk about…   Well, I went to the footy today… I would talk about that, but we lost, so I won’t…  Damnit… all that Collingwood could offer me for my effort of walking 20 minutes in a storm and getting soaked through on the way to the train station to get there was a measly two quarters of good footy… obviously not good enough to overcome the condescending demons of Toorak… damnit…  Anyway, enough about that, I think I have just successfully bored 98% of the planet with that last paragraph… as 98% of the people in this world don’t even follow the football… assholes…  Hmmm, going out tomorrow… meh, nothing that special… but I got nothing better to do… I guess I can be Ravi’s support from when he faints from excitement… ahahah….  Hmmm… what to write about… how about paperclips…  The history of fastening bits of paper together begins in medieval times when clerics and lawyers would cut parallel incisions in the upper left hand corners of bits of paper or parchment and thread lengths of ribbon through them. Some time later, sealing-wax came along, so people could fix bits of paper together with this as well. More than half a millennium was to pass before anyone made a serious effort to improve on these systems.   In 1835 a New York doctor named John Ireland Howe invented the first practical machine for making pins, and in no time at all, people everywhere were using Howe's straight pins to fasten papers together. For most of the 19th century, the pin's predominance remained unchallenged, and clerical workers kept pricking themselves and dying of unpleasant diseases as a result.   The paperclip as we know and love it today was invented by Johann Vaaler, who was born in Aurskog, near Oslo in Norway, on March 15 1866. Vaaler studied at Oslo University and took a degree in mathematics and science and was working for an engineering company that was commissioned by the Norwegian government to come up with ideas for making the civil service more efficient. Vaaler started messing around with bits of wire and came up with several different designs for the world's first paperclips. Because Norway had no patent law at this time, he filed his patents in Germany in 1899. He was granted an American patent in 1901, though he rapidly disappeared from the paperclip scene for reasons that are unclear. He either didn't realise the huge financial potential of his invention, or he couldn't raise the money to go into business. Either way, he now had competition. In the US, a slightly different design of paperclip had been patented by Cornelius J. Brosnan of Springfield, Massachusetts in 1900. It was being marketed as the Konaclip.   The paperclip in its commonest modern form, i.e. the one with the double-oval shape, was British. It was produced by Gem Manufacturing Ltd and marketed as "the slide-on paper-holder that securely holds your letters, documents or memoranda until you wish to release them". Before the First World War, the Gem Clip had established its dominance in the world's markets. In fact, we paperclip-collectors still know it to this day as the Gem Clip. Different designs come and go, but the only one ever to challenge the Gem's predominance is the Owl Clip; this is usually square or rectangular in outline, and with two eye-shaped circles in the middle, giving the vague appearance of an owl's face. Owl Clips are popular with some paperclip-users as they don't get tangled with one another and they don't tend to snag in other papers that don't belong with them.   The world consumes stupendous quantities of paperclips nowadays. In the US alone, some eleven billion of them are bought annually. What is all the more remarkable about this is how few of them are actually used for holding bits of paper together. In one of those flippant surveys that companies often commission to get themselves some free publicity, Lloyds Bank claimed, a couple of years back, that of every 100,000 paperclips in the States:       19,143 are used as poker chips     17,200 hold clothing together    15,556 are dropped and lost    14,163 are absentmindedly destroyed during telephone calls    8,504 clean pipes and nails    5,434 become toothpicks     While only five are employed for the purpose for which they were designed.   Meanwhile, Johann Vaaler was never forgotten in his home country. There is a memorial to him in Oslo in the form of a statue of a giant paperclip. This isn't some bit of loony eccentricity; Norwegians have a strong sentimental regard for Vaaler's invention - for an excellent reason. . . During the Second World War, after German forces invaded and occupied Norway, an order was issued prohibiting people from wearing badges and brooches bearing the initials of their exiled king. So people started fixing paperclips to their clothes instead; to collars and lapels and cuffs and hemlines. The paperclip was a Norwegian invention, and its function was to bind things together, and so it became a symbol of patriotism and of solidarity against the invaders.   - Courtesy of  http://www.mb007a2628.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/paperclips.htm

       man ive had a long day...  not in the sense that it was bad or hard to get through... just very eventfull.  i started my day by waking up... as you do, then, after doin some of the washing ( i don't do this normaly, but my parents are away for the weekend...) i headed off to my mate raven's, for a day of serious bumming around...   wong came over and we spent most of our time eating donuts coated in what looked like semen, but they tasted alright, so we ate them anyway, and not doing much.  well, that was heaps of fun, but i eventually had to head home... so i hopped back on the train and, well, headed home...  when i got home, i cooked myself a hardy homecooked microwave dinner, and got down to some serious... you guessed it.. nothing...  well, eventually, somehow, i ended up on msn with a few of my friends threatening to kill each other... with me egging them on of course...   i am a great man of peace...    [12:00:08 AM] ashli: your friend is a dickhead [12:00:56 AM] £Зmθŋ: that aint my fault, he was born that               way... [12:01:03 AM] £Зmθŋ: or he may have inhaled something     well thats about all i can think to post... so, yeah...  by the way.. anyone looking for a good video clip.. follow this link to asian girls do it best... its only about 1 mb.. and is worth the small download ;) although, this link is kinda low quality... i got a better version off kazaa :)  http://media.fuckallyall.com/flash/asiangirlsdoitbest.swf

       i think i'm slowly getting the hang of photoshop, so my new background looks to be getting closer.   anyway, today, the first day of my long weekend, was quite boring. here is an outline of my day.  12:00pm - woke up, ate breakfast, had shower, got dressed etc... 12:30pm till present - did nothing.  well.. yeh, thats about it....  anyhoo, today's fiddling in photoshop resulted in me colouring in one of my pictures, i think you will agree that its not bad for someone with no experience in either photoshop or drawing... so im pretty wrapped with the result...     recently i've been running out of things to say on my blog... but i think i've come up with a solution... i just won't say anyhing...  so...   bye!

       i'm back!  i know... i've been slacking off in the posting department lately, (shame shame) but i swear its not my fault! i completely forgot how much time school takes up...   anyway, it's probably good that you don't get too used to overly frequent posts here... because its pretty likely they won't happen...  and added on to being back at school, it seems like my long awaited return to the sporting world isnt that far away either, after my trip to the hand specialist today, all systems seem to be operational.  this may mean (shock horror) that my posting will become even more sporadic.  Just as a passing note... suggestions for picture of the week are open, for anyone who has an idea they would like to see...  well, you know, its very hard for me to come up with anything interesting to say at the moment. i am completely lacking inspiration...  i could attempt to write a long story about nothing, but that would make my site suck even more than it has to... so ill refrain... and go dominate the snooker world.  ttfn...

       yeop... i completed my last mid-term exam today, the fairly minor chemistry exam...   (huge sigh of relief)  however, this is not all good news, as now it seems that i probably have to go back to normal schooling... starting 8:10 thursday morning... how am i ever going to get back into the routine of full days at school?!?   oh well, at least i have the long weekend to look forward to!  thats right... queen's birthday weekend... such an australian concept.   "hey, i feel like a holiday..."  "i have an idea! lets make up an extended weekend in commemoration of the birth of some old bird we couldn't really care less about!"   yes, the queen... noone in australia really recognizes the british monarch as having anything to do with our country, because, lets be frank... she doesn't.  but that is no reason why we shouldn't get a free day off work... to not take a holiday would be unaustralian...  i love my country...  onto my next story...   (note: that was called a "linking sentence"... my english teacher says i should use these so my essays flow more fluently... but back to the story...)  well, it seems like this blog has sprouted a lot of small projects for me...  the first is the background... and yes... i haven't forgotten, i just haven't managed to get around to it between my playing pool and watching anime...  this project means i will need to learn how to use photoshop pretty well, which didn't seem too hard at first... but that program has sooooo many buttons!  The second began as a sort of offshoot of this... while consulting one of my many geeky (yet fairly cool please don't attack me with parcel bombs) friends on how this site worked.   Well, somehow he decided to start abusing me for the fact that my site was not pure xhtml, and that i should fix it...   so i have taken his advice, and decided to at least gain a knowledge of programming (or writing html, because technically html is not a code for making programs, but only for marking up static pages - see i'm learnig already!), to the extent that i can at least understand 3% of all the bullshit he was feeding me...   seriously, who really cares if some geek on a freeware operating system can't see my page in the way it is intended? not me!! hahaha... stupid cheap geeks..  anyway... i am deciding to gain a simple knowledge of writing html, just for the fact that i can say that i can... it might make me sound smart :)  and lets face it... chicks dig smart blokes... hehehe...  toodaloo! see you next time!

        "and on the ninth day god made chicken, lots of chicken, which he did tell adam and eve... "screw the fruit, eat chicken, it's good""    hehe... i think im starting to get the hang of this blogging code stuff... btw, i've finally made a links section, be sure to check them out... if u think you're site is worthy of being there, tell me, but i doubt that it is... hehe...  anyhoo, still no progress on the background... this is due to three reasons            1. I can't be stuffed           2. I don't know how to start           3. I can't be stuffed  you get the idea...   well, as you may have noticed, yesterday was the first day ever in the existence of my blog that i failed to make a post... get used to it... if you want to know why, view sections 1 and 3 in the list.   oh yeah, guess what... i still have an exam left :( stupid chemistry... and i haven't studied either (sections 1 & 3)   i dont really want to go back to school at the moment. Over the course of this entire weekend, i have achieved absolutely nothing of any importance... its been great :)  anyway... i think im going to fiddle around with the blog for a bit longer... i just took a look at my mate raven's blog, and quite frankly, im getting seriously owned...  so much catching up to do...

       hey all...  update on progress of the new layout: well, not much as yet, though i have installed photoshop 6, and it works, and i fiddled a bit with the liquify tool, but aside from that... nothing... im kinda lost as to where to start... hopefully inspiration will come to me in a dream, or at least by plagiarism...   anyhoo, this edition comes from my friend pat's house... not that it has anything to do with how i write it or anything, i just have nothing better to fill my blog space up with :D   btw, i just watched the first six episodes of trigun, an anime lent to me by raven... he said it was the best ever, and i'd have to say it would come pretty close... from my hard earned experience of two animes, the other being initial d, which is pretty cool too...   speaking of which, i think i'm becoming asian... (i'm turning japanese, oh yes i'm turning japanese, i really think so...)  watching anime, listening to asian music, (btw Fly away is a sik song... dont ask me who sings it but...)  anyhoo, my mate wants me to piss off his computer (not on)... stupid tightassed bitch... but i gess i can do an extra long one next time so you people can enjoy my adventures as normal... just dont read this one until i say so, ok...  dammit, why dont u ever listen? now you've ruined it for everybody... :P  well anyway... c u again... unless you don't come back, and then i probably won't...  but either way... i shutup now...

       hmmm, looks like im just gunna have to wait patiently for my copy of photoshop... i dont think that my idea of speeding up the process is going to work... perhaps i should tell you the full story...  well, it all started with this blog... yes, the very one you are reading at the moment, the ever titillating, excavating, masturbating... nonnahs mail ...  as you know, my background at the moment is far from exciting, and i planned to improve on the situation with a personalised motif for my blog... something, as a few of my friends would say... (well, the wierd ones anyway)... 1337.   well, my plan was to gain a copy of adobe photoshop, and fiddle around with the program in attempt to improve my site's "image". well, this seemed like a pretty simple idea... seeing as i knew a number of people who owned this program, and i figured i may even get some tips on how it all worked, to save me some trouble...   well, that was about when the trouble started...  i began by asking my mate raven, who said "sure, no problems"... but he had lent it to someone else,and would have to get it back off them.   To make a long story short, they couldnt find it, and i am left with an indefinate period of time before i may lay my hands on this sought after software.  but then, i remembered...   i remembered that my dad, who is an architect by trade, had a copy of photoshop at work... so i made a quick phonecall to ask if he could bring it home for me. he said "sure"  so now i have a copy of this much needed software... however, most of you that know me may know that none of my stories end that simply... and this is no exception...   yeh, you guessed it, the cd is a dud...  well, not entirely, i mean, it seems to have all the programs and installation files and everything... its just that it doesnt install... :S    anyway... it seems like my loyal followers may have to wait a while before my new layout is started, let alone completed... but, im sure that the literary content of my blog will be enough to keep you enthralled....  :S  anyhoo, i think ive past the word limit... so ill shutup...

       no, i dont mean that lucifer will come soon and chargrill humanity.. i mean it in the good way, as in i have only two exams left to endure...  i was having doubts about my decision of minimal study last night for my double exam ordeal on todays schedule, but then i sat the tests, and i learnt a harsh lesson... that the minimal study that i had partaken in the night before... was too much...  you know how easy i told you that my remaining exams by three... well, i understated..  here is my proof..  on my MGM test (for the ignorant :P, this is maths general methods, the subject leading on to specialist mathematics in year 12... ie the hardest maths) the following was a question worth about 2 or 3 marks, and there were other questions on the test worth less mind you...  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q: find the volume of a cube with a height of 8.2, a width of 8.2 and a height of (some other number i cant remember, probably a seven... damn the sevens...)  A: omfg i am leaving this subject...  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  anyhoo... i think i did alright in my exams today...  but no matter how easy the exams are, they still involve at least the energy to sit up in my seat, let alone small amounts of brainpower... therefore, i am gradually getting tireder and tireder.... so looking forward to my goal of 15 hours sleep on friday night...   i think thats enough for today... i have so much else to talk about, but i think i'll keep you all in suspense... hehehe, stay tuned for the next episode of nonnahs mail... same bat time, same bat channel...

       ahhhh, the sweet feeling of relief... relief that the physics exam is over and done with, ready to be placed aside and forgotten like a channel seven popstar...   that leaves me with four out of my eight exams left... a process not entirely as i had expected, half as important, but three times as tiring... my goal being at the moment to merely to survive without the aid of phsyciatric or chemical aids...   damn im wrecked...  anyhoo, seems like the worst is over, with two maths exams requiring minimum study, due to the fact i have already covered the entire maths course in the previous two exams, plus accounting and chemistry, which, contrary to thier outer appearance, are two of the most fluffy, substance lacking subjects in the entire VCE course. (thank god for publicly funded education)  although the worst is definately over, i still feel as if i must endure eons (is that even a word?) of study before that holy redeeming day of wednesday the 9th of june... will it ever come?  i know i probably shouldnt be posting such pessimistic feelings on here, as i know that it is possible, and highly that my fellow examees may read this, resulting in a contagious depression... but screw 'em... if i have to put up with it, so can they...   mwahaha  by the way, that request of a copy of photoshop is still standiing, as you can see, my site is in dire need of some redesigning...  well, i gess thats it for todays edition, i think i should at least glance over some accounting revision... i could never forgive myself for failing, let alone recieving a mark under 90% in such a simple subject...   saying that, the chances arent entirely equal to zero... there is always the chance that i collapse from exhaustion in the middle of the exam...  man i need sleep...

       damn stupid exams...  ment to be studying 4 physics tomorrow, but instead, decided to choose a much less constructive path, and create a blog.. hehe hey, why not? everyone else seems to have one, so, i may as well join in the fun... even wong has one, although i think its sick.. it has a very sore looking rash :P  btw, check it out - www.wongsblog.blogspot.com  anyhoo, i cant really bag his too much, my background isnt lookin so healthy either, i think i might play around with a new one when exams are over... can anyone burn me a copy of photoshop?   meh... speakin of exams, its almost 6, perhaps i should make a start on my physics revision..   ahh, fcuk it... i think ill go to bed...  ill do my physics in the mornin... exams dont start till 9 :s   on second thought, i think i will start that physics revision...

       Hmmm... I think I’ve left enough time in between posts now… I should prolly write something in, including my excuse as to why I have not been blogging.  Well… I have just been really busy lately… I think I mentioned I’m back at football now, and that means I’m not left with a lot of free time, with training and games taking up three days of the week. But, its fun, so I think I’ll stick to it... and I think my fitness is gradually improving... [Not that you can improve much on perfection :D ]   And, there is also the matter of school holidays… which, to most normal people would probably mean much more time for blogging…  Well… I’m not normal...  And there’s also the matter of my little brother being home all the time… and I mean all the time… if you thought I don’t get out much, you obviously don’t know Lewis. He has literally sat non-stop in front of the computer playing crappy game boy games continually from the moment he wakes up till he goes to bed.   This isn’t too much of a problem though, as it keeps him quiet and out of my face, and the only way that it affects me is that I am blogging a whole lot less, and not spending any time on the computer. This is prolly good for me anyway.   Although I wouldn’t mind it if my computer illiterate family could quit meddling with things they don’t understand… which, for my brother, is basically everything aside from notepad, and even that point is arguable.   He manages to make the computer unusable after only half an hour normally, so you can imagine the state that it is in after he has been tinkering away for almost a week straight.  Nothing works.   That explains why I am currently typing this blog in Microsoft word, for fear of the entire computer exploding in my face.   This also explains why my capital letters and punctuation are so well placed.   By the way, Kilsyth football club sucks ass… ahahaha… ten goal victory!! It felt mighty good belting out the song at the end of the game, knowing those stuck up bastards were in the rooms next door to us... they were so shattered… ahahhaa  And with that, I’ll leave you with my final note:    WWWWEEEEE’REEEEEE a happy team at Blackburn,  We’re the mighty fighting burns, We love our club and we play to win, Riding the bumps with a grin, at Blackburn Come what may you’ll find us striving,  Teamwork is the thing that counts, OI OI All for one and one for all,  Is the way we play at Blackburn, We are the mighty fighting burns!!
