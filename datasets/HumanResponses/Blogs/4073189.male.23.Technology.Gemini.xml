       Awaken Time:   1330hrs   Weather:   Clear   State of Condition:   Dun wanna wake up   What a day.. I guess I worked until so late last night around 0530hrs and had to force myself to wake up. Watched VCDs while aving lunch.  After lunch, I cleared a few cheques and sent out mails. What a joke for one of the mail I had to sent out as it was from NTUC Income. They sent me a refund cheque of SGD417. Free cash? But in the end I had to call them and tell them off why sent me a void cheque and I had to post it back... It was never about the 23 cents, its the extra time wasted...  Spent the rest of the afternoon and evening playing games & watching movies.  Completed Xbox game : Red Dead Revolver 1st Movie Viewed : The Bourne Identity 2nd Movie Viewed : Phone Booth 3rd Movie Viewed : Cube, Cube2   ORD countdown:   60 days    Why is there a timer for my ORD?     NS is a waste of time... And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPL

With my mee and chicken wing, watching movies one after another.   1st movie: Identity (English)    2nd movie: Zatoichi (Japanese)   Switched on my Xbox and played "Red Dead Revolver", an action cowboy type game until 1930hrs. Had chicken rice for dinner and started to encode "Around the World in 80 Days" DVD I bought. I was told that it was protected from copying by the sales person. Haha... My rules says, "Nothing is copy protected!" Successfully ripped it and making another legal set as my computer can't play the "so call copy-protected" disc. What the heck those people do so much to protect their movies... protect until my PC can't play and then I had to decoded &amp; re-encode it~!!! So much for supporting ORIGINAL~!!!  Brain's sleepy and had to plan tomorrow's day tommorrow...     ORD countdown:   63 days    Why is there a timer for my ORD?     NS is a waste of time...
