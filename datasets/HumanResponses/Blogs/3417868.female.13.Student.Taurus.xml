       perio's around the corner , tapping me on the brain to study already -- but long long ago, before people were created, existed last minuteness and cramming.&nbsp; my best qualities.&nbsp;i'm not saying i'm gonna cram, i'm just saying that i should have studied earlier so now, i would have time to do all my projects... well sorta cramming... :-)    today is friday.  official start of the super short vacation (which actually isn't and is just a way for teacher to give us more terrible lives even after answering all their damned questions and weird somethings in school) that i will spend for studying, memorizing and making of projects.&nbsp; i have so much activities and the truth is i'm having trouble balancing them. i'm easily carried away.&nbsp;    some hours ago, i had school. &nbsp; school was partly cool... it was kuya kith's birthday (don't actually know him -- don't even know if he ever has heard of me -- raissa, kelly and elisha were just talking bout him...)&nbsp; plus i had 2 loses today.&nbsp;  &nbsp; 1 filipino pic frame &nbsp; 2 integ science video quiz ( eh kasi naman mga ayaw makinig!!! jox)  cool, whatever!&nbsp;    sabayan practices, too! &nbsp; sabayan is the best... i feel the heat rushing through my veins though i know i should slighten the heat ( wron grammar?!) , it might distract me from my studies...&nbsp; worried weekend sickness is back again... i should make a name for this.   need to say BABOOSH!!!!

BADLY and NOW!&nbsp; first of all, i am sooo bad in confronting people that even sometimes i become so STUPID, all letters caps...     EXPERIENCE # 1  : ms pioquid bad confrontation -&nbsp; we were praying the angelus, there's the part where we respond, right?&nbsp; ms p responded and i thought she was talking to me so i said straight to her face in a jolly, weird manner "pooooo???" sooo embarrassing!    EXPERIENCE # 2  : ms ann bad confrontation -&nbsp; i was trying to help... :-( i thought she let me move the desk so i moved it.&nbsp; cool, but not until i played it back in my mind that i fully understood what happened.&nbsp; i saw her lose balance, now i remember! she was leaning on the desk! bad... bad... bad... bad...    EXPERIENCE #&nbsp;3  : -2p bad teasing - from the phrase itself...  now, i have lowered my pretty points, plus poise points, plus deportment points, plus all points... arghhh...   my head is&nbsp;aching...   i have 3 tests tomorrow, SOC SCI, INTEG and CLVE!!! OMG!!!&nbsp; i am so so so so so&nbsp;worried....   next stOp?! projects ... many&nbsp;many projects....&nbsp; integ, algeb, fil, the, clve and everythin' !!&nbsp;    my mind is stumped... so tata!!!

           got a bunch to do, as usual.&nbsp; the worried feeling i have every weekends is still with me. my mind is racing. i don't know where to start. have to finish early so i can do more things. i have to have time for myself ya know.     &nbsp;     WONDERING.  you may be wondering, with the tons of things that i have to do, where do i find time to blog? the answer is simple. our internet connection is slooow so i kill time by blogging, instead of just staring at the monitor and getting more radiation on my eyes... anyways...&nbsp;      &nbsp;   i finally have a  sum-up for my reaction paper  for indiana jones! cool!    Indiana and his father&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a quest together&nbsp;to find the cup that brings eternal life. This was the cup that supposedly Jesus&nbsp;drank from. After being forced to proceed through traps and dangers so that another&nbsp;group&nbsp;&nbsp;can find the cup, the cup is found. Indiana's father is shot to motivate him to find the cup for real. A knight guards the cup, and Indiana&nbsp;selected a&nbsp;cup which waws simple and knows for sure that a carpenter&nbsp;can't afford. He gets water and hurriedly went back to save his father.     &nbsp;   ciao again!!!     &nbsp;   song: hands to heaven...

COOL.  -- i'd fit right in... no one would even notice me.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  nothing to do, clock is ticking, i'm wasting time, what should i do?  &nbsp;  i can't seem to stop... that again... just read that, and that's what i'm totally feeling right now... plus the worried!!&nbsp; my life is freakin' me out!  &nbsp;  oh yeah... just made some changes to my website. not gonna upload it&nbsp; yet. wait for it to be complete... wait... wait.. wait...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   -- got from&nbsp; nikki's blog... hehe. i'm a stealer...  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       by some magical power yesterday, i actually stopped typing.&nbsp; or maybe it was just because of my longing to sleep...     &nbsp;    it's back to the books for me today .  need to make my reviewers since i can't make them during the weekdays because of  sabayan  practices... if i am still in (if you know what i mean)      &nbsp;    the "  w  o    r   r    i   e  d  " feeling i had yesterday was maybe due to my guiltiness of not doing my reviewers yesterday. and now, as usual, i'll be cramming!!!      &nbsp;   oh!!! i have to ask karla what we'll do in the roleplay tomorrow! goshes!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   GTG (got to go)!!!!!!

        monday blues...  not really dark blue -- this day had some kind of big ups and downs... maybe just sky blue... do you get me?!     first and foremost , i am glad to announce that 3.5/5 of  my tension for perio results  have been uhmmm... how dya call that? relieved???  i have quite good scores except for integ - really... guess science ain't my thing anymore, huh? or maybe earth science is what i shouldn't take... hope we have bio now even though there are tons to memorize...  THE for me, was quite confusing...  heck!     second and  sore most ,  sabayan ... sometimes i ask myself why i wanna join this...  the first time i saw a presentation of sabayan (gr 3 or 4), i immediately made up my mid to be part of it...  it's fun and sociable (is there a word like that??), you really get to feel that you belong to something important, you can give all the madness - yet nobody notices, you get to feel the tension that would last for weeks and make you hyper, you... you do sabayan things. there's just a distinctive quality that sabayan has...   this is my 3rd one i guess and so far, none has  proven its unworthiness...  but, here comes sermons that can last a day from your parents, sermons from leaders, from trainors, from teachers, even from your very self.  you get to ask yourself why you joined a group of lam-o people who recite a piece with weird body movements, why do this when instead you could go  lakwacha  or study for the upcoming exams?  well... answer for yourself.     third -  i have finally read the book karla was talking about,  madison finn super edition .  nice story. touching.  i know some of you would say it's childish... one thing i wanna say,  mind your own opinions, owkie?      fourth -  uhmmm?? i feel so sleepy, but much to do. nothing much to say about that...     fifth  -  i hate my sched for tom :   TUESDAY CHEMISTRY CHEMISTRY enrichment eng soc sci RECESS fil music/health LUNCH algebra int sci     sixth  -  debate...  read my other posts...    guess i'll have to  leave  my list up to here... my mom's pressuring me to take a bath...

        i   feel soo bad of not attending the sabayan practice - what more? i feel dead. dead because of the cold- unwelcoming stares i may get from the bigkasers the moment we practice on monday... or am i just over-reacting?  a while ago my bro accompanied me to the mass at andrews... it was ok. except the homily was soooo long and i can't understand it much... :-(        yeah... it's our recollection on tues... so soon.  hope it's not boring and will actually help us... not make us snooze...         lyrics of she will be loved...      Beauty queen of only eighteen     She had some trouble with herself     He was always there to help her     She always belonged to someone else          I drove for miles and miles     And wound up at your door     I've had you so many times but somehow     I want more          I don't mind spending everyday     Out on your corner in the pouring rain     Look for the girl with the broken smile     Ask her if she wants to stay awhile     And she will be loved     She will be loved          Tap on my window knock on my door     I want to make you feel beautiful     I know I tend to get insecure     It doesn't matter anymore    urlLink      It's not always rainbows and butterflies     It's compromise that moves us along     My heart is full and my door's always open     You can come anytime you want          I don't mind spending everyday     Out on your corner in the pouring rain     Look for the girl with the broken smile     Ask her if she wants to stay awhile     And she will be loved     She will be lovedI know where you hide          Alone in your car     Know all of the things that make you who you are     I know that goodbye means nothing at all     Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls    i have no inspiration so buhbye...

       i have been deprived of using the computer -- and the internet for almost a week and as far as i'm concerned, i can't last 2 days without it... just simply can't!  i know i havent been truthful that i won't blog during the exams, but i really really can't stand it!!! muho!      past is past...       BOUT THE EXAMS    examinations were tough... as in HARD super!!!  napiga lahat ulo namin  especially in THE, soc sci too!!!  i don't think i excelled in any subject that y scores were low in the long tests...  in GEN CHEM, i had a mental block... 5 seconds ago i remember the conversion factor for K-degree C... then BAAAM --  nawala agad sa isip ko !   INTEG was confusing FILIPINO and CLE too!!! any test with the analysis type (or is it analogy?)  the one with the instructions:     write A if A alone supports the statement     write B if B alone supports the statement   bla bla bla... C & D...   it really confuses me...   i have more to tell but i already forgot about them!       SABAYAN PRACTICE TORTURE  - ok ok... the sabayan itself wasn't the torture but the sermon i got from my mother for not going out on time...  why did she ever let me join the sabayan without warning me of her homilies?!  sabayan wasn't a bit fun (maybe a little) our voices were all over (sAbOg!!!) and we only did the voicing and the APL song...           SONGS I TOTALLY DIG AND LOVE!    1.   the show !!! i love it though if you come to think of it, it is actually full of malice -- but only if you think of it as a.. well... full of malice and you digest each and every syllable of it... other than that it's just an ordinary song that has good rhythm, good (looking?) singer(s)...   2.   she will be loved!!!  love it. simply love it.  officially (maybe) song of our tropa...  ELISH RAISSA KELLY  and ME!!!  i don't mind spending everyday.... beauty queen of only 18....   3.   happy ending ... a little... go AVRILE!!! woohoo!!! it's a cool song!!!   4.  let's get started!!! i'm retarded with this song!!! let's get it started (ha) let's get it started in here!!!       SOME POINT OF DISCUSSION!    - hmmm... i'm sooper dooper worried 'bout the debate!!!  i mean just as what as i said in my last blog = i can't even air my opinions in the classroom what more in front of people and as a form of a contest!    i'm not even fluent in Filipino... i don't even have any formal wear...   :-(   -the teasing goes on and on... detailed story, talk to me...   -tests not that well... so shameful don't wanna talk about it...   -mymp>> make your macho papa prod!!! eheheheh.... another name for DPWHu! i think or ballpen stealer!!! whatever!   -Ping (raissa, kelly crush) was an altar boy...       this is just bout it...
