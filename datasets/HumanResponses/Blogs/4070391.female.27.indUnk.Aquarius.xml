       Saturday morning, 11.45am      Damon woke me up this morning with a bit of start, I switched the radio on in my sleepy half drunken state during the middle of the night and so now, some of what I heard has gone in to my head and I am not too sure of what were dreams and what were reality.      I got out of bed and grabbed some clothes to shove on and take Lucy to the park. It took me about 10 minutes before I decided which scruffy clothes to fling on. I realize I was doing "scruff" but nothing looked fit for the occasion! Its really hot outside and I could tell through the sunlight peaking out of the corner of one of my curtains. I didnt want to face slapping on a whole bunch of sunblock first thing with a pounding headache and didn't want to show my body to the world so opted for a great big hoodie and tracky bums. I must have stuck out like a sore thumb as all the girls where strutting along in their designer summer dresses and guys in shorts bounded along with too much energy for my liking at this tine of day on a Saturday!      I walked round my usual route with nothing of consequence happening apart from seeing a girl pushing a child in a pushchair which reminded me of my cute little Izzy!      I am now sat in front of my puter in my flat which feels like an oven and should be featured on the life of grime. I have so much washing and cleaning to do but don't seem to have the energy. Got to make myself do it though GOT TO.      Am pondering the evening out yesterday.......Was a weird one, I think some times when people hype "going out nights" up they probably aren't as good as the impromptu ones. I mean, it was a little nondescript and I don't know whether that was partly down to me being really quite tired and a bit down or the fact we were all sitting in a long row which makes it harder to mingle. Was nice to see Chris he is a great guy and Helen too. In fact it was nice to see them all but let me put my bitchy hat on as usual.....I have worked out I don't really have that much in common with most of them. I mean don't get me wrong they are really nice people but perhaps not ones that I think I would make loads of effort with-I don't know though, maybe I am just a horrid person! Helen is lovely, she is on the same wave length and a moody old cynical cow like me and always up for anything and funny too!      everyone seemed to leave quite early but then I guess it was quite far for some of them to come and I think the conversation had dried up a bit anyway.   I wont mention names incase anyone of them stumbles across this but I think I do have real contempt for a couple of people last night and the fact that their social skills to me seem quite bizarre doesn't help. I have an issue with people who don't have very good social skills, there is no need for it at all.      I can smell the remainders of burnt toast seeping from my kitchen and in a weird way it is making me hungry!!!      Am going to go schanrf :)

        10.35am on friday which means only about 7 and a half hours to go until I can walk out of this oppressive place and not return for two whole days. I have only been sat at my desk for about 30 minutes and already I feel like an "outsider". Why is this? Everything seems to change without me. Research gets done, programmes get made, people come and go yet I seem to still be stuck in the same place doing exactly that....THE SAME. Blog needs to be haulted for a minute too many people and too many prying eyes.           Ahh, big long gap but I am back, had to post on the live server which I had never done before and thought I had screwed up but it was a momentry panic and all was well which was a relief!!! I think maybe I am a total saddo, there was an element of excitement when I realised I had posted something and it was there for the whole world to see-well actually thats not strictly true. The whole of the corporation, which for some people is their world.           I feel like someone has stamped on my head and is poking my eyes out right now, a pleasant thought you may agree? If my chair tilted far enough back and I could shut my eyes but make it look like I was working I would and  consequently fall right asleep. I hate talking about dreams because it is so dull to hear other peoples but last night I kept dreaming I was being chased and it climaxed with me being caught and then I woke up. I think that is why I feel on edge this morning. I can remember once I kept dreaming about being followed home down a dark street and it made me totally paranoid for weeks.           I think my blog may turn in to a great big moan fest but then again it is good to write things down it stops you from churning randomness over in your head and turning into a total mentalist.           Am feeling down the person I sit next to was in charge of a project I worked on last year, there were "issues" going on and for some reason I dont think I am liked by her very much because I am not your typical person round here. I dont play games and I hate fakeness beyond all recognition. She has staffed up on the same project for this year and keeps talking about really loudly deliberately next to me and researchers she is going to use. She knows I dont have anything to do and that I will probably lose my job at the beginning of next month but she hasnt asked me to go work on it as she did with the other researcher who worked alongsiede me last year. I knew she wouldnt want me and I dont really want to work with her, because I was really unhappy this time last year about the way she treated me. BUT I was told it always looks good when you are asked to work on the same thing again-also it makes you feel valued and good at what you do. I know I did a good job and the subject matter is right up my alley but its a shame about the fact that this woman just felt the need to openly make me look stupid. They are all getting excited about starting on it and I am sitting here wishing I could be excited and be included in something. I think right now  I feel like the kid who never got picked in PE (oh, actually that was me :)!!!!)            Doesn't it get really sad when all you want in a job is to work with nice people and feel needed? That could be as low rent as working in McDonalds I guess if the people were nice-its official though they don't like blindies.           I want someone to give me a break...HELLO, am not shit people I am kind of ok :)            Guess I will go and break the day up a bit by taking the dog out and getting some lunch. Its going to have to be soup again today I think especially if I am going out tonight....Oooh and then this afternoon I think I will do a tesco onliner....           Fooooood :)

         Well, here I am first entry in my blog.....       I should be working, afterall I am at work but as usual there isn't very much to do. People exhibit huge amounts of envy when I tell them I get paid for not doing very much. I don't see it like that tho-feeling undervalued and alone isn't fun and turning up to work with the answermachine light never flashing and inbox full of personal emails or porn makes me want to turn round and run home just as quickly as I have arrived.       I am now feeling guilty for writing this whilst at work everytime someone comes past I minimise the screen and open up a new email to someone, at the moment I have 6 open all of which are going to be deleted and never sent!        There is a big hooha going on in the office as I write, the new seating plan has just been created and grown people are rushing around the office "bagzeeing" their new desks. I am hiding myself away in my screen so nobody acknowledges me. I am sitting tight, don't think I will be included in the plans as I am claiming squatters rights at the moment. I shouldn't be sat in a department I am not working in but I like my desk, I have my own space. I am not sat next to anyone, I can whisper on the phone and am far enough away so I can maintain a tiny bit of privacey in this open plan hell.       Still I should stop moaning, I think maybe I come across as moany when sometimes I dont mean to be. I turn into a different person when I sit at my desk, someone full of paranoia and anxiety. In reality I am not really all that paranoid and only anxious when the need arises!        Hmm, well one milestone in my day is over, taking the dog out for a run and buying and consuming lunch. Today I ate french onion soup and bottle of water, hmm, when you write it down it seems like the meal of a convict. I am trying not to shove rubbish food in my face, cut down on fat, drink more and get rid of this "diabetes thing" that seems to have zapped away some of my energy. I can't remember the last time I felt truely "alive".....Got to see doc in 3 weeks again and hope I will have lost a bit of weight, I dont want to stick chemicals in my body but the sooner they stick me on these tablets the better. I want energy again, I want to stop feeling old every time I lay down as if the day behind me was the hardest I have endured thus far.       Going out tonight, will  be nice, I really want to sit in the warm with a bit of evening breeze, if I had my way I would leave at 5 but Damon is really busy but hopefully we will be able to shoot at 6.       Anyway will sign off for now.

        Its weird how writing can help when you are down isnt it....Even if I am just writing this to myself and nobody is reading it, it still makes me feel a bit better.          I am upset, really upset and I want to talk to someone but I dont know who. Who is the right person to. I hate being the kind of person that hides how they feel and bottle things up. I really wish I wasnt like this. I camt express how I feel and I want to because things are building up inside me but I dont feel I can quite get acros that I am realy sad. How pathetic am I, if I am down I run home to my parents. I dont talk about the fact I am down, I dont show that I am down I just go home and laze around the house. I know I am safe there though. I know if I wanted to talk my mum would listen and I know that they care, they really do care.          I feel really lonely and scared. Because I have been on short term contracts and one month ones at that for a while now people dont take me seriously when I say how worried I am. You know when you are waiting for your a-levels and at the time it is the be all and end all, and that if you dont go off to uni your life will be over. I feel like that but 10 times worse. I really like what I am doing at the moment I love working on the web and would love to work on the holiday site. It would be amazing if Kate whom is the researcher on it now, got the job she has an interview for. I overheard that they were interviewing 3 people for it so fingers crossed.          Cant seem to stop crying, I know I am tired, I know part of this is to do with the fact that I havent slept much but some of it is just withme all the time and I dont know how I can change my feelings around-really want to. I need to be wanted or want to be needed. Ho hum. Will go lie on bed not sleep. Cant sleep until 10 because otherwise I will wake up at some silly time......Have got that hideous headache when you have been crying and feel dehydrated. Will grab a drink and take a shower :(

         Missed   an   entry   yesterday   and   on   Saturday   too,   am   slacking   in   my   blog   obsession,   need   to   get   in   to   it   again.   I   guess   it   is   partly   due   to   the   fact   that   I   am   busy   at   work   (well   not   right   this   second)   and   I   dont   have   time   to   sit   down   and   write   and   then   when   I   come   home   at   night   I   dont   necesserily   want   to   be   stuck   in   front   of   my   computer.            Last   night   was   weird   I   had   a   grand   total   of   about   1.30   hours   sleep.   I   went   to   bed   at   about   12.30   and   when   Damon   texted   around   2   it   woke   me   up.   From   then   onwards   sleep   was   a   total   no   go   area.   The   film   alarm   in   my   flats   went   off   twice   but   I   couldnt   be   bothered   to   leave   the   building.   Knew   it   wasnt   a   proper   one   and   I   was   damned   if   I   was   going   to   be   standing   out   in   the   rain   at   that   time   so   I   just   lay   in   bed.            Feeling   a   bit   internally   depressed   today   but   a   lot   of   it   is   to   do   with   being   tired   or   as   my   parents   would   say   "over   tired"!   It   was   so   nice   to   see   Rhiannon   and   Nic   last   night   we   all   get   on   so   well   and   they   tow   of   the   nicest   people   you   would   ever   meet.   I   was   so   lucky   in   ending   up   in   halls   with   them   at   uni.   I   am   not   jealous   in   the   slightest   because   they   are   both   such   nice   people   and   deserve   everything   they   have.   However,   I   was   sat   there   yesterday   thinking   I   wish   my   life   was   like   theirs.   They   both   have   good   jobs,   granted   Nic   hates   hers   but   Nic   is   more   "the   grass   is   greener"   than   I   will   ever   be.   She   always   wants   what   she   cant   have!   Nic   is   getting   married   next   year   which   I   am   SO   happy   for   and   excited   about   and   just   has   a   mad   life.   Rhiannon   is   starting   an   amazing   new   job,   got   her   own   brand   new   gorge   flat   5   mins   away   from   her   boyfriend   and   is   absolutely   loving   life.....they   both   are   and   this   is   fab   as   I   hate   to   see   people   I   really   care   about   down.   I   just   wish   I   had   a   bit   of   this,   I   always   seem   to   feel   like   I   am   5   years   behind   everyone   else   in   where   I   am   at   with   my   life-  think   I   want   things   I   can't   have   or   for   some   reason   don't   deserve.   Is   it   a   big   deal   wanting   to   be   happy.               Thinking I may go back to parents this weekend but not sure. I know I have only just seem them and I hope they wont mind. Its weird I go home and it does my head as my parents are on my back. In a sick kinda way I like it, I like it that they care and I like it that they want the best for me. I just dont want them to talk about jobs as I know they will. I feel really safe at home but sometimes it over emphasises my unhappiness, not sure quite why.              Damon thinks if I lose my job (and can write this as think he doesnt read this any more....after all its not exactly that interesting is it??) He thinks I will move back to my parents which is so never going to happen, they are moving house next year and the thought of it would just kill me I think. What kind of life would I have-none? He doesnt seem to understand that I dont want to think about when my job finishes what I will do. Why would I want to think about something I REALLY dont want to happen. God it depresses me and makes me feel like an utter useless, crap idiot.

      Well its 7 something on Sunday night and I seem to mysteriously have Emmerdale on in the background which is a bit unfortunate as its a load of shite. It REALLY hot and humid outside and I dread going to bed as I am going to be tossing and turning all night trying to get comfy in the heat. The new douvet my mummy brought me is absolutely gorgeous its so soft and moulds itself round your body in only the way that feathery things do!  It has been a strange kind of weekend starting on friday night. I was really knackered and hadnt slept properly in ages, kinda feel I still havent. I waited at Damon's for about 2 hours for a cab whilst my parents were sat in a hot car outside my flat at about 1am. They wernt too stressed which I thought they would be and were ok when I drew up in the cab....was all a bit bizarre.  Yesterday was nice actually I love seeing my parents when they arent stressy and when they leave  I feel really sad, I dont know why I guess it because I love them very much and sometimes feel a bit lonely and lost.  God its soooo hot I think there is going to be a huge thunder storm tonight.  Did my application for web job and may do the other one tomorrow. I am not dreading going to work tomorrow either which makes  a change. God I really hope something turns up and that  I can get another job before the end of my contract. I am really quite scared and keep putting it to the back of my mind.....God what am I going to do?  Not a lot on TV tonight guess will just laze around in the heat, I wish my house was bigger and I had space and didnt feel crushed in to a shoe box. Think of all the Africans!!!!!

         Its   just   gone   6pm   on   Friday   night,   think   I   am   about   the   only   geek   still   sitting   at   my   desk.   Everyone   else   has   gone   home   to   this   lovely   weather   for   the   weekend.   It   looks   absolutely   stunning   outside   though,   the   sky   is   blue   and   you   can   just   imagine   the   breeze   on   your   face   if   you   were   outside.            Well   a   week   down   here   has   past   and   I   actually   think   I   have   learned   a   lot   not   just   physical   things   like   how   to   use   flip   etc   but   also   the   thoughts   and   ideas   that   people   round   here   have.   You   can   be   as   techie   as   you   like   but   if   you   dont    work   in   the   environment   of   these   people   you   dont   know   how   they   generate   ideas   etc....            Have   learned   how   to   do   flip   though   which   is   cool,   feel   like   I   am   adding   more   stuff   to   my   CV   which   is   great.   Flip   is,   as   I   use   zoomtext   not   the   most   of   accessable   things.   If   you   use   it   on   the   whizz   thing   it   sounds   like   Whizbit   but   isn't,   then   this   isnt.   When   I   use   html   I   want   to   be   sick   all   these   codes   and   numbers   etc   it   makes   my   eyes   crazy   and   I   can   barely   focus   on   it.   I   have   got   the   hang   of   it   and   undestand   what   I   need   to   know   at   the   moment   but   it   does   take   me   longer   than   otehr   people   I   would   imagine.            I   feel   like   today   has   gone   quickly   as   well   I   have   been   busy   finding   content   and   coding   so   now   feel   like   I   have   earned   the   weekend.            Parents   are   coming   tonight,   they   sounded   a   bit   stressy   on   the   phone   as   they   had   not   yet   arrived   at   my   aunt   and   uncles   house.   I   really   dont   want   to   deal   with   stress.   I   am   going   to   be   cooped   up   in   my   flat   all   weekend   basically   anyway   while   they   go   do   stuff.   I   dont   really   mind   it   if   they   are   having   fun   but   its   going   to   be   really   hot   and   It   is   nearly   unbareble   when   it   gets   like   that   in   my   little   goldfish   bowl.            Anyway   am   a   real   loser   sat   at   my   computer!

         Nearly   6pm,   still   got   stuff   to   do   but   thought   I   would   take   a   break   for   a   minute.   Am   feeling   hideously,   internally   depressed   and   down.   Want   to   see   my   niece   she   would   cheer   me   up-  too   expensive   to   go   there   and   my   sister   probably   needs   time   by   herself   with   Izzy   and   Hamish   :(

          Wow     I     feel     like     I     havent     blogged     properly     in     ages!     Have     completed     my     days     tasks     really     and     now     dont     have     all     that     much     to     do.     God     I     like     having     things     to     do,     my     things     to     do,     things     that     are     part     of     a     project     that     I     am     working     on.     It     seems     so     long.     I     guess     this     isnt     really     "my     project"     but     I     feel     like     I     am     valued     as     a     person     and     what     I     is     as     well.              Sara     will     have     gone     by     now     I     guess     she     was     staying     at     mine     on     and     off     all     today     until     she     met     her     mate.     I     kinda     liked     the     pub     we     went     to     last     night.     There     was     something     "homely"     about     it     not     commercialised,     chainy     or     anything     like     that.              I     saw     Emma     at     lunch     time     and     we     talked     about     stuff,     she     was     talking     about     the     baby,     she     met     another     short     person     who     had     a     baby     and     wanted     to     talk     things     over     with    her.   She   talked   about   her   doc   idea   and   how   now   she   was   just   counting   the   days   because   there   wasnt   much   point.   She   said   that   she   wanted   a   baby   when   she   had   "made   it   at   work"   I   said   that   this   is   no   reflection   of   her   but   the   sad   state   of   our   department-  they   really   have   a   lot   to   answer   for.   They   make   you   feel   like   you   are   shit   and   bad   at   your   job.            Just   had   a   glass   of   wine   with   the   peeps   round   here   at   the   gardening   site   sort   of   hate   doing   those   things   but   at   the   moment   am   making   a   real   effort   I   need   to.   If   I   have   decided   that   here   is   where   I   want   to   end   up   I   need   to   be   seen.   I   have   watched   a   few   of   the   researchers   here   and   think   I   have   their   skills   plus   some.   They   may   know   a   bit   more   on   the   techie   side   but   I   think   I   could   be   really   good   working   down   here.            God,   feel   a   bit   tired   and   red   in   the   face   after   wine,   lucy   got   scared   at   the   corks   popping   but   everyone   round   here   seems   to   love   her   so   she   got   lots   of   attention   at   the   same   time,   right   now   she   is   asleep   right   under   my   desk.            Anyway   am   talking   shite   will   go-  maybe   blog   later?

        Its   just   gone   10    and   I   am   sitting   at   my   computer   after   a   relatively   hassle   free   trip   in   to   work.   I   am   glad   in   some   ways   that   I   live   close   by   when   we   have   freak   weather   issues   like   we   did   last   night   because   I   can   get   in   just   fine.   Then   again   I   dont   really   have   any   excuses   for   not   coming   in.   Trust   me   this   morning   I   could   have   slept   for   Britain.   Last   night   was   one   of   those   really   hideous   ones   I   was   still   tossing   and   turning   and   talking   to   Sara   at   about   2.30   as   I   just   couldnt   get   comfy.   My   ex   broken   foot   was   throbbing   like   it   only   does   in   the   cold   winter   months   and   there   was   zero   air   getting   in   to   my   room....NOT   NICE.         Some   times   I   have   these   flashes   of   scaredness   that   come   over   about   work.   I   thought   this   time   next   month   I   wont   have   a   job   and   I   dont   think   my   department   will   bail   me   out   or   could   justify   it   again   as   I   am   not   working   there   right   now-  this   is   scary   stuff   now,   it   just   dawns   on   me   when   it   shouldnt.   The   last   few   days   I   have   been   happy   about   going   in   to   work   but   now   I   will   start   being   scared   and   anxious   which   is   a   bad   thing   and   which   I   hate.   I   need   to   get   a   grip!        I   dreamt   someone   read   my   blog   last   night   and   that   they   called   me   up   and   stalked   me....so   if   anyone   is,   please   dont   stalk   me   unless   you   are   called   Damon   and   I   will   let   you!        I   was   going   through   some   of   my   old   things   last   night   and   showing   Sara   pictures   of   times   gone   by,   mid   way   through   I   was   crying-  I   really   am   such   a   freak.   Think   I   have   unresolved   issues   going   on   from   my   past   as   every   time   I   think   pre   17   I   get   upset   and   this   horrible   feeling   in   my   heart   starts   up   and   then   there   is   an   element   of   relief   when   I   think   that   I   am   living   in   the   present   and   that   things   are   vaguely   ok   now.   Am   probably   an   emotional   fuck   up.        Anyway   guess   I   should   blog   off   and   do   something   but   I   can   tell   that   another   entry   isnt   too   far   off!

         Just   gone   10   on   a   Tuesday   morning   and   have   managed   to   get   myself   in   to   work   at   a   reasnoable   time.   Now   I   am   actually   "working"   I   cant   drag   my   sorry   ass   in   whenver   I   feel   like   it!   I   really   didnt   want   to   get   up   this   morning   it   felt   so   oppressive,   there   was   no   air   and   it   was   humid,   damp   and   sticky.   I   woke   with   a   start   again   today   as   I   seem   to   have   done   the   last   few   mornings.   I   was   having   a   hideous   dream   that   I   was   being   chased   by   a   gang   of   people   and   they   were   trying   all   sorts   of   means   to   kill   me   and   burn   me   alive.   I   left   the   dream   as   I   managed   to   make   my   way   out   of   a   concrete   shack   that   had   been   sealed   up   so   a   fire   could   be   lit   and   people   inside   would   have   no   escape.   Being   the   ninja   that   I   am   I   escaped!!!!   Not   a   nice   dream   at   all   though.            Am   still   feeling   full   from   last   night,   ate   way   too   much   food   and   was   laying   in   bed   groaning   about   it   last   night   when   Sara   seemed   absolutely   fine   and   she   is   skinny   as   a   rake!   I   had   a   nice   night   yesterday,   didnt   intend   on   it   going   on   for   so   long   but   maybe   there   was   an   injection   of   youth   that   Damon   and   I   just   dont   seem   to   have   any   more.   Told   Vic   about   the   pub   but   should   stop   telling   people   as   everyone   will   end   up   going   there   and   there   will   be   no   tables   left   for   us!            Well,   I   am   sat   at   my   desk   on   the   cusp   of   ending   this   and   starting   some   work.   It   actually   feels   really   good   to   have   things   to   do   of   my   own,   you   wouldnt   believe   it.   I   was   telling   Vic   this   morning   as   we   walked   in   to   work   about   working   in   my   department   but   she   was   based   up   there   for   a   couple   of   years   or   so   so   totally   knows   what   it   is   like   and   talked   about   the   "egos"   before   I   even   got   a   chance   to.            Just   finished   talking   to   Damon   on   the   phone   and   have   totally   lost   my   train   of   thought.   I   was   clearly   going   to   write   something   very   witty,   unusual   and   clever.            The   more   I   think   about   it   the   more   traumatised   I   am   feeling   from   my   dream   still   I   am   glad   its   not   groundhog   day   or   I   would   shoot   myself.            Ok,   After   a   couple   of   phonecalls   and   few   conversations   whilst   writing   this   I   guess   I   will   go   and   get   on   with   the   script.

         Just   a   quickie   as   I   cant   seem   to   resist   putting   an   entry   in   here....            Freezing   my   ass   off   and   think   I   may   turn   into   Kristina   in   an   ice   block   a   bit   like   David   Blane-   AC   is   tooooo   on!

        Its around 10.38 and am sat at my desk waiting for zoometext to be installed on to the computer I am going to be moving to in IF&amp;L for a bit. Am feeling a bit nervous for some reason but don't know why I am sure I can do most things they want from me pretty easily-god that sounds arrogant, didn't mean it like that.          The IT people on the phone always make me feel so small when you call up to request "access technology" they never know what the flip you are talking about and insist you have to get permission from an AR....After being put on hold for about 5 minutes they come back and of course take my details and say it can be done. The guy I just spoke to on the phone said "have you always had it on your computer and what seems to be the trouble with it?" I asked him if he knew what the software was, as the way he was talking indicated he didn't....He nearly jumped down my throat and killed me-they bug me. I know more about my software and if they just gave me permission to stick a disk in and install it myself it would save so much hassle and time!          I am now going to call an access person to help me move my stuff, I am going to leave some of it on my desk and take with me the bare essentials .          Last night was so hot I nearly died but I think I dropped off around 11pm and really needed it. I think I have really taken to snoring and not quite sure why as I never used to.          Eyes are feeling droopy now though and could drop off to sleep nicely.

      Ok.  Its 9 something on Sunday night and you know how you get that feeling when you are a kid and you just dread the monday mornnig? I have got that right now. I am going down to work in a different department tomorrow for a month. I am looking forward to it as it will actually mean stuff for me to do YAY. However, I always get a little nervous when I move offices. I can't remember for the life of me where Vic the producer sits and am not sure where my desk is. Then I get anxious during the day that if I get up and move will I ever find it again! I hope its near the water cooler too, I love it when I sit near the cooler and I gulp back water like there is no tomorrow. I make up for all the other times when I sit in offices and dont really know where the coolers is. I bet I am sitting two thousand miles from it though! The good thing  think about webby stuff is that you dont have to get up from your seat very often and find people-its all done from your computer which is very blindie friendly!!!  Sara is here at the moment laying on her bed reading and I am sat hear with the cd player on listening to Keane. I know this is a really random thing to write but I wish I was really skinny :(  I am still a bit sore, nobody will know what I am talking about apart from the one another person if they are reading this! Sometimes though if you dont have pleasure you dont have pain though eh????  Eaten oven fries and tuna quater pounders from Tescos, they were buy one get one free and I can really understand why, they are rough NOBBODY buy them. V fishy and a bit of a bizarre texture although I think they may be quite low in fat.  Anyway just had a shower (again today) as felt all hot and sticky and gross and am sitting here in relaxing pjs feeling the breeze from the window on the side of my neck. i wish I could have the windows open and hear silence but it doesnt quite work like that when you live right in the middle of london.  Anyway, feeling a bit knackered so going to go now....  Wish me luck for tomorrow :)

       Life update.      Well, I did manage to drag my sorry ass up and have not sat down all day, cleaned the kitchen bathroom and big room, did my laundry, defrosted my fridge, unpacked my tescos shop, had a shower and washed hair. Feel a bit silly really, I bought some new shampoo a couple of weeks ago. It seemed really nice, organic apple with a gorgeous smell. I need to buy "products" with plenty of smell don't quite know why, maybe it all started at the age of 6 with my smelly rubber collection (that's eraser collection!).....Any way back to what I was saying, I used this shampoo quite a few times and nearly got to the end of it. Every time I used it I always thought it didn't get too frothy and wasn't cleaning my hair that well. I put it down to the fact that it was all organic and stuff. After my wash today I took the bottle out of the shower for further inspection and realised I had been washing my hair in goddamn hand soap for the last 2 weeks!!!!      I did a great tesco shop and got lots of lovely things, my most exciting being a huge punnet of strawberries and most boring being a pack of dishclothes! The mobliair I bought for Damon looks quite ingenious and you even get batteries with it-god knows how it works....Cant believe I am sitting here talking about air fresheners!      Might have a bit of a lie down on my nice fresh laundry before I start getting ready to go out tonight. I have been out every night since Tuesday, that's quite impressive, mind you to be at an equal with Damon I would have to go out tomorrow night but then again maybe I will!
