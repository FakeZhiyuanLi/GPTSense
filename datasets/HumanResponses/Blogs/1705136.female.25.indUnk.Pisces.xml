       I want to hide away tonight with you climb into the darkness, into the warmth beside you I want to hide my face from the world and feel the warmth in the dark places beside you  into our cave away from everything else away from the world I want to climb into the warmth of saftey into the darkness  will you come with me my love? will you hide with me and hold my hand? will you pet my hair and whisper giggles?  the warmth is so inviting beside you I feel safe with my eyes closed.

       such a smile takes away all worry how strong hands can cup and hold so gently my face a gentle kiss melts the world away making this depression slip aside into the light  some days are so horrible I know the pain that lurks within me and how it creeps  taunting me with the loss of you filling me with fear that you may leave   you help me fight. you give me strength so I may fight harder  I will make it go away! with you beside me, I will overcome this pain and torment...  We will fight together and win! this sickness will not control me any longer.

       ...pulling my leash with urgency until my face is so close I can smell his scent everywhere. He pulls the leash to bring my face to his. I pull away, teasing. A hand is at my head and wrentching my head back by my hair - the leash wrapped around hand and yanked forward - tongue shoved into my throat as he makes me kiss him - hand strengthens its grip until it hurts - leash pulled closer, tongue becoming more urgent.  I am released.  I am in love.

       beyond the call of gods and of heroes beyond that taste of salt on lips i feel the infinite wonder  i taste what gods feel within their caves of plato what majesty is within these walls feeling the stone never to be toppled the eyes never to close out the light the infinity of darkness within these strong barriers protecting soft hands and delicate sensations from damage the will of Her that allows passage from one to another to another and then to end resolution. the world changes the surroundings alter the mystery understood to be complicated again the power of Her to be enclosed in another form another gender another being and myself patterns seen but not understood too quickly life seen in photographs.

       take me home with you forever where I may rest and sleep  in your arms now all is forgotten I have no cares nor woes  my hands are stained with earth the air is filled with the smell of life the sun is warm and does not burn me  I hold your arm and smell you beside me feeling your smile on my face  the night wind is chilled it flows through trees like water the ground is firm and holds them firm against the warmth of the earth  the shining light of the stone the fire within that cannot exist  I feel the life beside me when I am safe against you forever I feel the earth inside me  and the presence of the Divine around and through me

       seductive secretness behind doors warning me to never let in the silence  warm air inviting sleep and quiet reflection wind moving and creating the noises that silence me  strong arm protecting me from the nightmares that envelop my mind in the darkness his body warms me while his eyes consume me  blessed be this place of saftey and serenity I am at peace at last  with him that holds me at night.

       For being so kind to me when I need you most; for holding my hand and petting my hair when I cry; when you bring me water and chocolate icecream; when you offer cuddles without saying a word.  Without you my life would be so much less -  Through you I have learned what happiness truely means. Because of you I can see myself with a family  and dream dreams of children and family Yules together.  For making me stronger then I ever thought I could be; for making me believe in myself; for making me feel beautiful when you look at me like you do;  for helping me see the sight of love when I look back at you.  Thank you my love.  You make me so happy.

       blurry outside sounds as people mingle and pass in the darkness focus on hazel eyes filled with wonder and ... searching lips moving; mind's attention soaked with longing  the background melts away  bodies moving closer without moving touching without intent feeling the warmth of another's breath  the past fades away I have found my heart within him I know the meaning of desire at last.

       my body feels broken while my mind rejoices at the thought of you the warmth of a smile dulls the pain in my legs the promise of an embrace erases the sight of another hill  sweaty bodies mingle in the dark warm places of the mind sleep envelopes me safe within your arms  to be awoken with a slight kiss

       transported through the air into the mall across town through the throngs of girls in pants too low and boys with gold necklaces  into the shop beside the bank near the bathrooms  the colour of love is present  not being over-powered by the sound of elevator music and rap mixed together

       life that has over-come the garden  taking control with vibrant chaos and green-ery  burnt by the sun again, cut by a blade drowned again by the flood to be trampled by a foot and hand again  bless-ed sweet water  washing away the dirt and grime again

       White that blankets has turned grey Quiet of the evening danger promises slick noise to be hated trudging trudging trudging sludge sludge sludge in an office building I hate with people I pity instead of the white forest quiet reflection nature instead of consumer drive shallow endeavores win over thin ice and frosted trees the spring is coming  the holly king is dead the oak is reborn again  i mourn the holly prince as She celebrates the rebirth both celebrations are lost on those who worship here i pity myself for my presence

       The fire that forms The rain that cools The air that shapes  delicate fleshy hand touching history cold and eternal history of persons, animals, the Earth, the gods feeling the power within and sharing knowledge of one another leaving a part to take a part that will be shared again  something small and light within my pocket;  cupped within my hand;  held between my fingers; thrown out into the ocean.  shaped and moulded for shelter and the religious rite fallen through war and time stands ever as a monument to a forgotten past  to be remembered only by those who ask.

       brilliant colours swirling within my head  to be consumed with the orgasm of a thousand exploding stars  how such a small thing can produce such majesty!

       Mighty fury drowning out the sounds of death creating life through destruction  a pity that they do not understand those who cannot hear Your song whispered in the trees flowing through the river  death is not punishment from Your touch but a promise of new life.

       the fury comes in bursts into the mind the eyes see the possibilty of revenge against ...   torture through seeming kindness works here hours wasted but not in vain self-glory hands dirtied in the striving of perfect retaliation  the rewards are sweet to the taste and eyes the ears are rewarded with praise and the pride    with stiffled fury of the victim  the sweetness is better then any hot meal
