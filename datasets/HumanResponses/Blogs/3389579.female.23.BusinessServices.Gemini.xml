      I have come to the conclusion that War absolutely sucks!  I remember when we went to war originally back in March of 2003.  My friend Tim Stewart was ready to go the instant there was even a hint of war.  I wonder why that was.  Now he's been there for 3 months, and he says he is having a good time.  How can you have a good time amongst death and destruction.  It was pretty cool when he told me that he is getting to see a lot of places that are mentioned in the Bible.  If that is what he's referring to when he says he's having a good time, than I understand.  I want Tim to come home, but that won't happen for 9 more months.    Since we've been in California, Justin and I have become very close to another military man.  His story is different than Tim's, in the fact that he absolutely hates being in the military.  He doesn't hate the military, persay, but he sees it as a job and nothing else.  He got shoved into the war when he had barely turned 18.  He joined the Marine Corps at the age of 17, because his parents wanted him to clean up his act, and then he got sent to Iraq and was a part of the original destruction of that country.  We don't ask him about it, because it tears him up, but we know he had to kill lots of people.  Now that he's been home for a while, he is going to be sent back.  I don't want him to go.  He has become a good friend to Justin and I, and it just reminds me that war tears friends/families apart.    I don't really know where I'm going with this post, but I think I just wanted to get it across to everyone that I hate war!  I am not against President Bush, but I do hate the fact that we had to go to war.

      Yesterday, May 24, was my 1st wedding anniversary.  It was a very cool day, but it's sparked some interesting thoughts for me.  Q#1) Am I really old enough to be married?  A#1) Yes, I guess.  Q#2) Am I really mature enough to be married?  A#2) It depends on who you talk to.  Q#3) Do I know how to be a Godly wife?  A#3) I can only hope and pray.  And the list goes on.  Justin has assured me that most of these things are very true, and that I need not worry.  But I know I will still doubt myself from time to time.  The attribute that I want to strive the hardest for is being a Godly wife.  It means more to me than I ever thought it would, because Justin deserves the best.  He deserves to have a wife who seeks God's will, and will constantly strive to/be do anything he needs.  I want to be his confidant, I want to be his helper, I want to be his sounding board for sermons and lessons, I want to be his friend, I want to be the bride that Christ compares His church to.  Man, I definitely have a lot to live up to.    When I got home from work, Justin took me to my new favorite Japanese restaurant, Benihana.  I already had a love for Japanese food (cooked, not that raw crap), but this place just makes the food even better.  We had fun watching the chef chop things up, bang on the grill, do a little show to impress us.  I've always thought it was funny how the Japanese restaurants rely on their chefs to entertain the customers.  Anyways...it was great food, great service, and it was my anniversary!   Then he took me down to Santa Monica to walk down the Third Street Promenade, which is this really cool outdoor mall.  This place is cool, because you get to see no-name people (who are just praying that some big recording company executive will walk by and hear their self-written ballads) about every 50 feet singing and putting on their own little mini-concert to the passers-by.  You also can do any kind of shopping you want, because there are clothing stores, restaurants, an Apple store(which we unfortunately had to stop in), shoe stores, basically a mall.  Then we were going to go down to the beach, but the walkway was forever away and it was already 9:45 (we still had 30 minutes to drive home), and anyone who knows me well, knows that I'm not truly coherent past the time of 10:00pm.  So we just stood and watched the ocean from up on the pedestrian's sidewalk for a little while.  It was very romantic.    So, after this first year with my husband, I can truly say, that this has been the greatest year of my life.  I have grown, and I have been stretched beyond what I thought was possible, but it has been great!  Living with alone with a guy is hard work, especially for someone as detail-oriented, neat-freakish, and picky as I am.  I know that I shouldn't try to "train" Justin to be the person I want, but I do hope he'll learn to pick up some of my more anal habits, so that I don't have to work as hard at home anymore.    There is one thing I know for sure...I love Justin with all my heart.  You forever have my heart, Buddy!

      I just had lunch with one of the nicest people I've met since I've been here in California.  He works with me at the Hilton, and is the only person that consistently goes out of his way to say hi to me.  There's just one thing that makes me a little uncomfortable being around him.  He's very flamboyantly(sp?) gay.  I've never really met anyone who was gay, so Cesar's friendship is very different for me.     For the first month I worked here, he didn't know that I was a Christian, or that my husband was a pastor.  When he found out, he got angry with me, because the only Christians he's known, have turned their backs on him and said he was "dirty."  I had to explain to him that I would NEVER turn my back on him just because he chose this lifestyle.  I said I didn't agree with the way he lived, but I would never judge him because of it.  It took some convincing, but he finally came around to the fact that I wasn't going to drop him as a friend.    Now, my main goal is to show him love.  Justin is trying to help too, by coming in and talking to Cesar when he can.  Cesar's not quite sure what to think of Justin yet, but he's liking him more and more (in the purely platonic sense).  Today we were supposed to have lunch at work together, because he said he needed to talk to me about something.  I was so excited, because I thought maybe I would be able to talk to him about Christ.  Instead, our general manager ate with us, so we couldn't really talk.  I was a little bummed, because I was really hoping he would just ask me what I believe, and why.    We have talked about the Passion movie, but it didn't really affect him.  He just said it was not news to him that Jesus died in that way, and he was shocked that people would take it personal.  I explained that for myself, it was a reminder that I am the reason Christ was up on that Cross.  Even though I wasn't born till many years later, I had a direct hand in causing Jesus to be brutally beaten and killed up on the cross.  Cesar just looked at me and said, well, I guess.    How do I talk to him?  I find it very difficult to just come out and talk to him about stuff, unless he asks me.  Am I truly making a difference in his life?  I don't know...maybe I just provide a good source of entertainment.  Am I pleasing God by just being his friend, and not rebuking him because of his lifestyle?  It's a question that will always be in the back of my head.  Does any of this make sense?

      Today has been good.  I didn't have to wear my daily suit to work, which was nice.  Instead, I got to wear a Hawaiian shirt and casual skirt.  I am the Sales Coordinator here at the Hilton Garden Inn Valencia Six Flags, and today myself and my boss threw a Hawaiian themed party for our corporate clients.  It went well, and made the day go by very fast!  That was the nice part.    Then I came back to my office to see what kind of messages I got while I was at the party.  My mom had emailed me to let me know the tragedy that happened in my hometown.  Apparantly, some kids had gone out partying this past weekend.  On their way home, the driver rolled the car and was killed instantly.  Two of the kids had only minor injuries, and the other kid was put in the ICU unit at the hospital.  During the funeral for the driver, the school got word that the kid in the ICU had finally died as well.  They've been having prayer services almost every night since then, and they're even thinking about canceling the high school finals, because 2 of the kids were still in high school and the other 2 had graduated last year.  I feel awful, mainly because I know one of the kids pretty well (thankfully, he only had minor injuries), but at the same time, I almost feel that maybe this will teach my hometown a lesson.  IT IS NOT OK TO LET YOUR UNDERAGE CHILDREN DRINK.  There is a tradition in Heyworth, IL, that goes something like this:  As long as I (the parent) am in the house, and my child's friends leave their keys on the upstairs table, it is okay for them to drink down in the basement.  I went to a few such parties when I was back in high school, but I was known as a designated driver.  It is a sad day, when 2 of our underage children drink and die, and a sad week after, when all the parents are grateful that their own child is not dead.  I blame the parents first, the kids second, and our society third.  The parent's receive blame first of all, because they are teaching that it's okay to drink when they're underage.  First they do it with their parents, then they don't think there will be any consequences if they do it out in the country with just their friends.  Where is the concern and love for their kids?  I blame the kids second, because they're always going to push the envelope when it comes to their kids.  It's the feeling of, "What can I do next?"  And I blame our society third, because no one ever steps out and shows their disapproval of underage drinking.    It is not up to me to judge, because there is One who is the ultimate judge.  This blog is merely my frustration.  I don't think people realize that their actions will ALWAYS affect other people.

      Well, I had a little free time at work today, so I thought I'd finally create a blog, so Lucas would stop hounding me about it.  So, here it is...I can't promise that there will be daily entries, but I'll do my best.  OK, I've read most people's blogs on graduation...(at least the blogs that I faithfully read).  I would have to agree with almost all of you.  I have definitely outgrown Lincoln, and all her glory.  I'm not trying to put myself up on a pedastal, but for some reason, I did not feel at home there, when I was back on Saturday.  There were so many things that I thought I would feel happy to see, but when I actually saw them, all I could feel was disorientation.  I just didn't feel comfortable being back in the LCC bubble.  It was good to see people.  I truly miss certain people.  Then there are those people that I am merely an acquaintance with, and it was a mutual feeling of "eehh."  I don't know how to put my feelings into words, because the feelings haven't quite unwound in my own head.    I think part of the reason I can't quite understand how I felt about the trip was because Justin did NOT want to go.  He is fed up with LCC, mainly because they keep messing up graduations for us.  Last year, they messed up my graduation, and this year Alan Kline told him he couldn't graduate because his online class with University of Texas hadn't gotten his grade to LCC.  He's done with the class, and anyone who knows him, knows that he probably aced the class, but yet he couldn't graduate.  Of course, he wasn't told he couldn't graduate until after we had purchased our airline tickets for over $300.00.  Alan Kline is a great registrar, I'm sure, but he needs to show a little grace, or at least a little remorse, when he gives bad news.    All in all, the two hours spent in Lincoln, and the 2 1/2 days spent in Illinois were good.  I didn't get to see my family like I wanted, but it was a good trip.  I am happy to be home in California, because the weather is awesome, I had GREAT friends to pick us up from the airport, and Justin was much happier to be home.

      Justin and I are moving on July 15.  I am counting down the days till we get to move!  Today we have 15 days to go.  It is 15 days too many, though.  We live in a nice apartment, don't get me wrong.  But, it is not exactly in the nicest area, it is 20 minutes away from everything we do and all our friends.  This new apartment is bigger (though, still only a one bedroom), nicer, in a nicer area, has a full washer/dryer, a big bathtub!, and the list goes on.  There are so many positives to this new place, that the positives of the one we live in now are almost non-existant.    The only problem is, by moving, our rent will go up almost $200.  But, since we both have full-time jobs, that doesn't phase us anymore.  The difference between rentals in Illinois and California initially shocked me, but they don't anymore.  I most of the time forget that, in Lincoln, we paid less than half of what we're paying now for an apartment twice the size of this one.  I think I tried to forget that one so that it didn't bum me out anymore.  I have finally come to the realization that Justin and I are going to make it as adults.  We are responsible for each other, and our parents have no more obligations to be our sources of being.    Growing up is a wonderful, but hard thing to do.

      All married couples should try to go on as many dates as possible.  Even when there are kids.  Justin and I try to go on a date every Monday night.  Last night was one of those nights.  We went to this real cool miniature golf course that is made with real grass.  Justin was so excited because he was going golfing today, and it was going to be good practice for him.  Plus, this is first real greens course that he's seen.  It was funny to see him so excited to play mini golf.    To get to the point, we bet each other on who would win.  If I won, he had to take me to get frozen yogurt (which he does not like).  And if he won, I had to take him to get Jamba Juice (which I like, but didn't want last night).  It was really close on the back 9.  I was doing real well, and even got a hole-in-one!  I think I even shot par.  But, anyways, He added it all up, and he beat me by one stroke.  Dagnabit!  So close, but yet I still had to get him Jamba Juice.  So, remember, once married, dates are a good thing.  It's even okay to make competitions out of your dates, because you're not trying to impress each other as much anymore by letting the girl win.  Competitions keep fun in the marriage, if you know what I mean!

      I walked into work today in a pretty good mood.  I sat down and started to check my email, when I saw an email entitled "Jim Strange," from my mom.  That scared me, because that's my uncle's name and I knew something probably happened to him, otherwise she wouldn't have titled her email like that.  So I opened it, and read this,    "The details are lengthy, but would you all pray for and put Jimmy on your church prayer lists, please?  He was the engineer on the northbound Amtrak involved in a gruesome suicide train accident south of Champaign at Savoy last night.  Sam talked with him late last night by cell.  Jim was being sent back to Carbondale on a southbound Amtrak.  Right now, Jimmy is in shock.  Please keep him in your prayers.  Love, Chris/mom."    That scared me to death, so I called my mom immediately to see what had happened.   Apparantly, my uncle was the engineer last night on a northbound train to Chicago.  Right before he hit Champaign, he noticed a man standing on the tracks.  So, he naturally pulled the horn and the brake at the same time.  He said that he made eye contact with the man, and then the man turned his back to the train and committed suicide.    It took Uncle Jim 500 feet before the train actually stopped from when he first pulled on the brake, because he was going 79 miles/hour.  My uncle is in shock, because in his thinking, he just killed a man.  He knows that it wasn't his fault, but there's still that feeling of guilt.    I've been sitting here at work thinking about this off and on all day.  I called my mom, and discussed this with her a little bit, and she told me her feelings.  She's angry.  I SECOND HER ANGER.  Suicide is such a hard thing to deal with for families, in the first place.  But when you decide that suicide is the only option left for your life and then you decide to make someone else half responsible for it, that's just plain selfishness.  This guy probably didn't even think about the fact that he was going to involve someone else in this suicide attempt.  Someone who he didn't even know.  Maybe if he did think about that, he figured that since my uncle didn't know him, it wouldn't be that bad.  WELL, HE WAS DEAD WRONG!  Figuratively and Literally.  I feel sorry for the family as well, because they are left with all the issues that this guy felt were too overwhelming to deal with.  I know that I will calm down in a couple days, but right now, all I feel is pain for my uncle.  He was put in one of the most difficult situations that I could only imagine being in.  Please, help me Lord, to forgive this man.  I'm sorry, Uncle Jim, that this man dragged you into his unsatisfied life.  I will pray for you, that you will come to a peace about this situation.  I will also pray that your life will go back to normal soon.  I love you!

      I don't really have a lot to say today, but I do have a lot of time to kill.  How to do this, I'm not real sure, but I thought I'd maybe blog for a few minutes.     I had a good day today.  When I got to work, Alina brought me a dozen roses with some gerber daisies mixed in for my birthday.  They are from her and her boyfriend, who is one of my other managers.  Then she took me to lunch at any place I wanted.  And then my brother called me when we had gotten back from our 2 hour lunch!  I have had a pretty good day, so I can't complain too much!  Well, Justin did good with his presents for my birthday!  He got this swimsuit I've been wanting for a while, but it was way too expensive for me to just buy it for no reason.  He also got me the new Norah Jones cd.  It's good, but not as good as her last one.  I also got a new camera from my parents!  I've been wanting it for a while because I want to start taking photography classes.  I also got a gift certificate to our mall from all the other pastors at our church.  That was mainly because I've hooked them up with hotel rooms and banquet rooms a lot in the last month.    So all in all, it's been a good day!

      Well, today is my birthday.  I'm officially 23 years old.  This is a hard one, though.  I stated earlier in another blog that my dad and I have the same birthday.  Well, this is the first one where we haven't been able to see each other.  All of our traditions just go right out the window.  No movie/dinner together.  No angel food cake with sticky icing from Grandma Norma.  No call from the Kascel's with the Happy Birthday song to both myself and Dad.  As happy of a day that this is supposed to be, it's kinda got a sad ring to it as well.    I would like to say Happy Birthday to my dad.  I miss you, Dad!  Okay, God just amazes me...I've been feeling kind of down today, and I had just gotten done writing that I didn't get my annual birthday call from the Kascel's.  Well, as soon as I got done writing that, my cell phone rang and it was Jenni and Jewels singing Happy Birthday.  I started crying!  Thank you God!  That just made my day so much better!

      When Justin and I came out here, he was the Jr. High intern.  Then, once he was brought on full time, we became just regular old Jr. High sponsors.  I used to not like Jr. Highers, but since we've been out here, I've learned to love them dearly.    Now I have a hard time dealing with High Schoolers.  Especially High School girls.  I don't know what it is out here, but girls are idiots, and the stereotype "Valley Girl" is not just something that is in books or movies.  It's real.  There really are girls like that in this state.  Especially here.  The term "Valley Girl" is usually used for a girl from the San Fernando Valley.  They really do say "like" every other word.  They really are really dumb.  And they really do dress very slutty.    But anyways, my point of this blog is not about how I don't really like High School girls, but it is about my day on Sunday.  I was a sponsor who got to take some High Schoolers to Knott's Berry Farm (which is this semi-cool amusement park next to Disneyland).  I was dreading it, and actually thought I had gotten out of it.  But to my dismay, the other female High School leader backed out and they had to call me to go.  I just didn't want to go, but I was praying the whole time that God would help me to have fun.  As it turned out, Kelsey, one of the girls that I thought I couldn't stand was one of the few girls going.  So I was even more put-out because I didn't want to deal with her.    The irony is, I had a GREAT time.  I just put aside my own desires, and let God lead me to be a fun leader for the day.  We had a blast, and I really got to like all the girls that went.  Even Kelsey.  I actually got to know her a little bit more, and she's a pretty cool girl.  I'm sorry that I put an initial "dislike" label on her.  I wish I could tell her that, but then I'd have to admit to her that I didn't like her at first.    I just want to say that God shows me new avenues every day to go down.  I usually don't like to try new things, but He's shown me time and time again, that he is the one in control, not me!

      It's a weird phenomenon in my family, having similar birthdays/anniversaries/other holidays.  We obviously didn't plan it, but apparantly God thought it would be cool.  So I'll go by month.  March  :   Casey and Jeremy (my brothers) have birthdays 2 days apart, and my Grandma Strange's birthday is the same as Casey's (and it just happens to fall on St. Patrick's day).  Jeremy's wife's birthday is 8 days before his.    May:   My mom's birthday is at the end of May, just 3 days before my wedding anniversary, and 2 weeks after Mother's Day.  My niece has a birthday at the beginning of May.  June:   My 23rd birthday is next week.  My dad also shares that day as his birthday.  And so does my great-uncle (who is not with us anymore).  And mine and my dad's birthday always falls on or very close to Father's day. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law have their wedding anniversary today!  My Father-In-Law's birthday is 5 days before mine.  And my parents-in-law have their anniversary 3 days after my birthday.    July:   My brothers got married 2 weeks apart in July, so their anniversaries are very close together.    We'll skip a few months here.   October:   My nephews share the same birthday, mainly because they're twins.  My Grandpa's birthday is at the end of the month.  November:   Justin's birthday is usually on or right before or after Thanksgiving.  December:   My mom and Dad's anniversary is a few days after Christmas.  It's this thing my family does...we celebrate everyone's birthdays or anniversaries or holidays with one big party a month.  We make sure, though, to recognize each individual birthday or anniversary or holiday.  I would feel horrible if we didn't recognize each one, because then someone would feel left out, and that they are not as important as that holiday.  This is a good practice, and ALL people should take note of it.

      I miss my niece!  Her name is Abbie and she's 2.  We were very close before Justin and I moved out here, but I was scared that she would forget us or something like that.  But, luckily, that hasn't happened.  She knows exactly who we are, and I guess she talks about us all the time.  She is so very cute.  I might be biased, but she is by far the cutest little 2-year-old I know.  She is absolutely beautiful, and way smart!  She's memorized her bedtime story, to the point where her mom, Katie, says 3 words in a row and Abbie finishes the sentences.  What 2-year-old can do that?  Man, she's smart!    Last night we got on our webcam and talked to her.  I have this nickname that I call her, and I'm the only one who calls her that.  So, last night, Jason and Katie (my brother-in-law/sister-in-law) were prompting her by asking her what does your Aunt Hillary say to you?  She answered correctly..."Hi Love!"  That's my nickname for her, "Love."  It was so funny, because she kept getting real close to the camera.  Maybe she thought that we were in the camera, but I don't think so.  She's so smart!  She knows we live in California and the only way to get here is by plane.  I wish they would all get on a plane to come out here!    I think the only point I'm trying to make is that I miss her (and all of my family) and I'm glad she didn't forget me.  I only wish I could have had the same chance to get to know my nephews, who were only 3 months old when we left.  They will most likely have no clue who we are.  That makes me sad.  How do I fix this?  I don't know.

      Well, my mom is quirky!  I've had good times and lots of great times with her, and I've had bad times with her.  I love her with all my heart, but when I was younger, I always swore I'd never be like her.  Isn't that what all kids say?  It's because when we're kids, we didn't know what was best, as much as we'd like to think we did.  Unfortunately, she did.  She always knew what was best.  She did have my best interests at heart.    Unbeknownst to me, I grew up exactly like her.  I'm neat and clean.  I say quirky things A LOT!  I like to be in charge.  I am a faithful wife (though, in my case, it's only been for a year and for her, it's been 33 years).  I like things done a certain way, and if they're not, I'll change it later.  I like to read.  I like the quiet.  I look a lot like her.  I even find her humor funny when noone else does.  And the list goes on and on.  I don't exactly find these qualities to be bad, but the more they get pointed out to me, the more scared I get.  Not really scared because I don't want them, but scared because I am turning out to be exactly like her.  Justin is always telling me to stop picking on him about cleaning up after himself.  I think I do it because I grew up with the idea that everyone is to fend for yourself, but make sure it's done neatly.  He laughs at me all the time because I have to have the bed made a certain way, and the towels folded just right.  Those are all things my mom instilled in me a long time ago, and I guess I just forgot that it was her that made me do it this way when I was a kid.  Of course I do have a lot of different qualities that she doesn't have, just like she has qualities that I could only wish for.  I just think it's weird how God creates us.  I bet He's laughing right now as I'm writing this blog because I'm shocked to find out about this phenomenon.  I hope you're having fun, God, because I'm gonna take this issue up with you when I meet you someday, hehehe!  Am I weird, or what?

      The one thing I have tried to do since I got out here to California and started working, was portray Christ in my life.  I long to have someone ask me why I don't get upset at some things, or why I don't drink alcohol all the time, or why I am nice to everyone.  Every once in a while do I get someone who will actually ask me about myself and Justin.  I then tell them that Justin is a pastor, and that sparks about a 5 minute conversation.  I hope someday that conversation will be longer.  But working in a non-Christian environment is totally different/harder than I thought.   So...from that, I get this next emotion!  I'm going to kill Alina.  Alina is my manager.  I work directly with her day in and day out.  She is a very cool and intelligent person.  She's from Romania, but speaks 5 different languages, not including uding Romanian.  From what I can tell, things are done differently in her country.  She says all the time how nobody in this country does anything efficiently.  Well, she and I both know that's not totally true, but a majority of our country does just loaf around to the point of major frustration.  Anyway...sometimes she just pushes my buttons, because she's so abrupt.  She continuously gives me things that need to be done in a fashionable manner, but how can I get them done when 5 minutes later she gives me another thing that needs to be done ASAP?  A lot of the time, the things she's giving me are things that she has more time to do and just doesn't want to because it's "easier" for me to do it.  And then when things go wrong for her (even if I had nothing to do with it) she yells at everyone.  She does apologize from time to time for being a jerk to me when she is mad at other people.    I am always trying to portray myself in such a way that she will notice I'm different from everyone else.  How can I portray a Christian attitude when she keeps testing my spirit!  I just don't know how to act like it doesn't bother me when she expects/demands me to do things right at that moment and I have a lot of things on my plate.  There is not one bone of patience in her body some times.  How in the world do I portray the image of Christ, when all I want to do is yell at her?  And so goes the saga of working in a non-Christian environment...

      Well, a lot has happened since last week.  It seems like it was a long time ago, but yet it was only 7 days.  Who knows...time sure does fly, but sometimes it seems like it's walking very slowly.    Memorial weekend was a good one for me.  Friday I got to take a half day, and saw "The Day After Tomorrow."  It was OK.  It was a good movie, but there were some things that I really questioned.    Saturday, I went shopping and had lunch with my good friend, Angel.  We had our last Saturday night service at Real Life Church!!!!  I am so happy about this one, because now I get to have a husband on Saturdays!  (Someday I'll write about our awesome church, and let you all know what we're up to!)  But anyways, our leadership chose to get rid of our Saturday night service, and add one more, making that 3 services on Sunday mornings.    Sunday, Justin and I went to San Diego with our friends Dan and Angel after church.  We got 2 hotel rooms (one for the girls, one for the boys) at the Hilton.  Sunday was just great, because we got to talk a lot, and we went down to the beach so Justin and Dan could do a little night surfing.  It was very nice!  Then we went to Benihana, thanks to Grandma Dottie (who is this older lady who has taken the four of us in and takes us to dinner all the time), and enjoyed the funny chef.    Monday, ah, Monday...what a day it was!  We got up and went to one of Camp Pendleton's beaches (Camp Pendleton is a Marine/Navy Base), since they are private and Dan (a Marine) got us on.  He wanted to take us there because there wouldn't be a lot of people out, and he and Justin were going to teach us ladies how to surf.  Well, Angel didn't want to, but I did...so I did!  It was hard, but it's really fun.  I did get up 3 times, and so I feel very proud of myself.  I will become good at it eventually, but I will need to practice a lot before that time.  The only downfall to Monday was the fact that I got VERY sunburned.  I got burned so bad, that I had to call in sick on Tuesday because I had a fever from the sunburn.  Oh well...I learned how to surf!  It was awesome!  Since then, it's been just mundane days.  Nothing real special to write about.

      So, Justin got hurt on Tuesday night playing softball.  It was actually a pretty scary night, because Justin doesn't get hurt easily and he has a very high threshhold for pain.  This is how it went down.  He was in centerfield, trying to catch a fly ball.  It was going deeper than he was, so he turned to run after it.  About his 3rd step out, he said he felt/heard his hamstring "pop."  He fell down and then got up.  At first he said he didn't think it was that bad, so he hobbled to switch places with their catcher, and I met him at home plate.  From behind the fence, I could see him sweating really bad, and his breathing was really labored.  I knew from that, he was in a lot of pain.  So I asked him if he wanted me to take him to the hospital.  Right at that moment, the next batter came up and commented on how he didn't look so good.  He lost all sense of balance and started to fall.  At that point he realized he needed to sit down and I yelled to have someone help him to the dug-out.  The sweating got worse, and all the sudden his eyes started rolling back into his head.  The guys hollared for me to go get my car and take him to the ER.  So I did, and as I was driving up, the guys that were helping him to the car shouted that he was completely gone.  He had fainted from the pain, and was having a hard time staying awake.  They started dumping water on him, to wake him up, and told me to hurry as fast as I could to the hospital.   So, long story short, the ER doctor was stupid and way too hasty.  He diagnosed Justin with a hamstring pull and gave him some weak-strengthed Vicaden.  That was Tuesday.  Yesterday, Justin told me that he needed to go to the doctor, because there was no bruising as of yet, and the pain had not subsided whatsoever.  So I took him to the doctor, and she confirmed what he had been thinking all along.  He had partially torn  his hamstring.  The bad thing is, the doctor said there was nothing he could do for it but wait for it to heal itself.  If it had been torn all the way, he would have had to go to surgery, but it's only torn partially, so there's nothing we can do.   I feel bad, but I'm trying to be the best in-home nurse possible.  He's bed-ridden, because it hurts him too bad to walk, so we are having a lot of down-time at home, which we probably needed.  If anyone has any ideas about how I can make him more comfortable, please let me know.  I'm open to most ideas, so give 'em to me!

      I'm on my own this week.&nbsp; Justin went back to Illinois to preach at his home church and to do a wedding for a friend from high school.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't get off work, so I didn't get to go back&nbsp;with him.&nbsp; I don't really like being home alone.&nbsp; I actually have never liked it, but at this point, I realize there's nothing I can do about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   So I have a week full of activities in my action plan.&nbsp; I work till 5 every night, and then I am planning on going to the gym after after work every night.&nbsp; Tonight, I have to go back to our old apartment before I can go to the gym.&nbsp; I have to turn in our keys and I will be hopefully receiving our security deposit back.&nbsp; Tomorrow night I will be doing a bunch of things, which include hopefully finishing putting everything away in my new apartment.&nbsp; Friday night, I will be at work for a party that my department is throwing.&nbsp; And then on Saturday, I am planning on being lazy till I pick Justin up from the airport.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what I should do during my week alone, please feel free to offer them.

       Well, Justin and I are all moved into our new apartment!&nbsp; It's fabulous!&nbsp; I absolutely love everything about it, except the tiny storage closet on our patio.&nbsp; This apartment is so much bigger, brighter, and in a great location!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  This was the best move ever!&nbsp; I packed everything, Justin moved it all to the new apartment while I was at work, and a friend of mine unpacked it all for me!&nbsp; It was the easiest move I've ever gone through!&nbsp; We only started packing on Saturday, and was moved, unpacked and ready to&nbsp;relax by Thursday night.&nbsp;

      I've lived out here for 6 1/2 months, and I haven't seen any celebrities, other than 1 semi-popular soap star.  So, it's been pretty uneventful in that area.  Until last night!  Last night was Justin and I's weekly date night.  He surprised me by getting free tickets to the Mercedes Benz Cup, which is a tennis tournament.  Last night was the opening night, and the night when they do all sorts of fun things.  They invite celebrities to come and play with professionals, and they have singers and all kinds of stuff.    When we got there, we were looking for the table that had our tickets, and we happened to stumble across the celebrity entrance.  There, no more than 5 feet from us was Tom Green and Jillian Barberie.  She's actually a lot shorter than you'd think.  She's about the same heigth as me, maybe even a little shorter.  Then, when we got inside to the court, we learned that the celebrities playing were going to be Dr. Phil, Jon Lovitz, some soap star and the blond girl from 8 Simple Rules (the show that had John Ritter in it before he died).  Wilson Phillips was the opening act, and they were terrible.  They only sang 3 songs, and the only one that sounded any good at all was their hit from the early 90's.  I can't even remember what the name of it was.    So, it was a fun night.  We actually left before it was over, because it actually got boring towards the end of the night.  I was pretty chilly, too, so we took off early.  I was satisfied, though, because we got to see some celebrities finally.  It's cool, but the excitement only lasts for a few minutes.  Oh well.  I had fun.

      I never really thought I would have a lot of friends throughout the years that I could go to whenever I needed to, even if I hadn't seen them in a while.  I've recently been experiencing the fact that I do have those friends.  And it makes me feel really nice, because they are GREAT friends.  I really only have 3 "best" friends, not including Justin (who is the only person who knows absolutely EVERYTHING about me).  Here they are, in no particular order:  1) Jenni.  Jen and I have known each other since we were 1.  She is best friend in the whole world.  We've been close all of our lives.  It's one of those friendships where we don't need to be all "clingy" to each other, but we enjoy every minute of our time together.  When we're not together, we miss each other, but we don't dwell on it.  There are always certain things I can count on when it comes to Jen.  I can always count on getting a call from her and Jewels (her mom) on my birthday, simply so they can sing Happy Birthday.  I can always count on getting an awesome cherry-filled "candy cane" bread dish on Christmas Eve.  I can count on her never cutting her hair past her shoulders.  I can count on her to give me a shoulder to cry on, or an ear to listen to, and someone to laugh with.  Jen, you will always be my BBF and I LYLAS!  2) Lindy.  Lin and I have known each other since we were 18 and freshmen at LCC.  We grew closer and closer over the years, and finally in our last 2 years, we were the only ones of our "group" left.  So we became even closer.  I know I can always count on her to make me laugh.  To make me jealous because she's beautiful, she's intelligent, and always got cooler things than me.  I know that we will be close friends, even if we never live near each other again.  I love that she calls me for advice.  I usually don't have good answers, but I just feel privileged that she would think of me to ask.  I would always drop anything I'm doing just to talk to her!  3) Greg.  Greg is just one of the nicest people you could ever meet.  He's always willing to listen, to play cards, to just hang out!  He and I met my freshman year at Lincoln, and have been good friends ever since.  It wasn't until my Junior year that we got real close, and I could consider him a best friend.  That's what he still is, though.  I definitely made sure it was okay with Justin when I would want to talk to him on the phone.  When we were still in Lincoln, Greg and I had coffee meetings.  Before Justin and I were together, we would just go on a whim.  Once Justin was in the picture, he would sometimes join, but mostly he just gave me an ok to go with Greg to get coffee and talk.    My number one best friend will always be Justin.  That's one of the reasons why I married him.  I have always felt like I could tell him anything I did or felt or wanted to do, and he would never be judgmental.  He has always supported me in all I do, and I do the same for him.  God blessed me more than I thought was possible when he decided Justin and I would be together.  Thank you, Lord, for bringing Justin into my life, because I've never felt safer.  I have 2 sets of arms wrapped around me at all times...God's and Justin's.  He makes me feel special at all times.  He thinks of me before himself.  He loves me unconditionally.  He's HOT!  He's funny.  He's a great basketball player and golfer.  He's intelligent.  He's HOT!  Thank you, too, Lord, for the friends you've brought into my life.  I am a better person because of them.  I love you!

      I probably won't be around a computer tomorrow, so I just wanted to let everyone know that Tomorrow, Saturday, July 3rd, is Emily York's birthday!  Make sure you either email her a happy birthday note, or call her, or even comment here on my post to let her know you're thinking of her!    Happy Birthday, Em!  I hope it's a good one!

      Occassionally I get those kind of headaches that affect your entire body.  Today I got one that attacked me to the point where I couldn't even see clearly.  Everything was very blurry, and everytime I would squint to see better, it made my head hurt even more.    Then, all the sudden, it just disappeared!  It was wonderful!  I had taken some Tylenol earlier today but it didn't really help.  Then my headache just went away on it's own.  I am very grateful, because it was really getting hard to do anything with my eyes open.  It's kind of easier to work with my eyes open, so I am grateful for the headache to go away.
