      Thank you God!!! You have said you will provide us with what we need and you definitely showed it tonight! The spaghetti dinner we had to raise money for Melinda's mission trip to france brought in over $800! I was hoping for $300. I mean, this being the first thing the youth group has done like this and all, i wasn't sure what would happen. For a while i was kind of doubting a good turn out. There was graduation today and whatnot ya know. But during work while i was wiping down trays I felt God asking me to pray for the fundraiser and i stopped what i was doing and prayed. When i'd finished i looked up at the clock and it was 5:30...the spaghetti feed was just starting. I was so worried the whole time at work because i wanted to be there but i knew i would be soon enough and i'd find out what had been going on. Well i didn't end up getting off work till 6:30 and arrived at the church at about 7. When i walked in there were only a few people left. It was kind of a downer cause it made it look like the night had been a bust...i guess i didn't remember that it was supposed to get over at 7. lol. oh well, after we'd cleaned up and stuff we were told the dollar amount! Oh MAN was i surprised...i guess i shouldn't have been though...i've seen what God can do this was nothing for him. I dunno, i'm just so pumped about it. It's kind of a huge sigh of relief after how most of yesterday went. It was a huge boost for my faith and lesson on provision and such. Thank you, Lord, for how you provide in my life and in the lives of those around me. I praise you for the success of the spaghetti feed earlier tonight and the money raised for Melinda's trip. It's amazing to see all you can help us to accomplish. Thank you for the volunteers who helped out and i pray that you bless them and the people who donated as well. I pray, Father, that you might help me in strengthening my dependence on you. Forgive me for my doubts. Please give me the strength to break my dependence on the attention and acceptance of people. I know, Dear God, the only way to ever truly be satisfied is through you. When doubtful thoughts enter my mind, Lord, I pray that I will remember today and how rewarding my faith in you can be. I pray that in those times i will always remember your sacrificial gesture of love which took place so that i may be saved. I thank and praise you, Lord, for how you are provided for Melinda's trip and I pray that it will help encourage the rest of her family...In Jesus' name, Amen.

      And so it begins...I've finally completed the long painful 3 steps in creating this and just know you're practically giddy to hear about it. Oh well, I guess i COULD go on for hours but it's so late...I need my beauty sleep. Until next time, God bless!!
