      The book is getting published.  My book.  It's poems.  About 229 pages of them.  Went to this copy shop today to get them printed out.  Got ripped off.  Thirty cents a copy double sided.  I only printed out the short version.  Fifty three pages.  Cost twenty dollars.  Over that.  A bit more.    Ridiculous.  Don't go to copy shops on St. Laurent Bvld. Here in Montreal.  They're a scam.  I'm off to look for a Mail Boxes Etc now.  They have the plan.

      Well, I don't speak it, the language see.  I had the rudiments passed to me when I was young.  Didn't stick with it.  My father always said, the only good thing coming out of knowing the French language is going to be the ability to get a government job.  You don't want that do you Rob?  Well, I wish I had learned the language and maybe a couple of more on top of that.  But wishes are for kids with cancer.  And even then all you get is a trip to the phony kingdom.  However, they all speak English here as well, and I muddle through ordering stuff.  It's going to be hard to make money here.  Friend of mine says I should consider doing gay webchat or squirt videos.  No sex, just renting my image and words with movement out to the regimented bidder.  Cant be that bad.  It's not work.  All I do is sit there and tell these old ones how much I want to touch their cock and stuff.  As for the squirt videos, you get paid about $300 tax free just for pounding it in front of a camera.  Now that's what we're fighting for out there in the hot desert.

      Jerked off in the can this morning.  Mindful that the people upstairs might hear the slaps.  Do it in the shower most of the time to minimize noise, but I didnt want to waste any more water.  People got to drink it right?  Thats what the ex said to me, the recent one.  Dont throw trash in the toilet.  Like Q-Tips or anything.  Says that its gotta be filtered from the water that we will later drink.  I asked her about what gets tossed in there on the reg.  Shit, piss, snot, that stuff.  She said that that stuff was easier to filter.  I asked her if she had gone to school for waste management or something.  She said no.  So how come you know so much about shit and piss I asked?  I'm dating you arent I?, she said.  Tommorow I'll jerk it in the shower.

      What an excellent way to spend time and give credence to my minimal existence.  Most people dont give a fuck about what celebrities had for breakfast, let alone what a nobody like me had.  Well, I have had three slices of orange and two cups of coffee.  Oh, and I smoked two cigarettes.  I'm still hungry.
