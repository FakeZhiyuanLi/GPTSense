         Tonight Ryan and Tony picked me up to go to the pool hall with Liz and Ryan. When we got there we were waiting on Liz and Ryan to get there. A few min. before they did Leslie came up there (Leslie and Liz dont like eachother) So when Liz got there she got all upset and left. I was so pissed! How can you let someone have that much of and advantage over you. She left her best friends. So when I called her there was no getting her back at the pool hall. So me tony and Ryan all had our own fun.      Later that night come to find out Liz is talking shit to me and Ryan telling us we can fuck off! So I told her that I didnt want to be friends with some one who is backstabing. She tried to say she was sorry and whatever but I honestly didnt want to hear it. She pissed me off beyond belief.       Well What is a true friend anyway?!

         Today I got a phone call at 9am from Ryan and yes I was still sleeping hard...snoring, drooling the works...so anyways...he wanted to come over and hang out until he had to leave to go to the lake. When I woke up Eka wasnt home so I was like uhhh...this is not good. lol. So I got a hold of my mom and she said it was fine if Ryan came and got me and went to his house.        When we got there we just hung out and played on the computer. He had chores to do so I got to watch him do that...but yeah...I always have a good time with Ryan. He is my everything. I love him more then I love anyone.         So I got home at like 1pm and I was so bored. I called Ashley Vickers and we talked for a while and then she went to work and Ryan called and then I had to take my sister to Ekards to get some stuff for her trip to San Antonio and so we went to the one that Ashley was working at and talked to her for a lil while. Then I got home and Iam so bored... lol.         Then I call my dad to tell him that IAm coming this weekend and that me and Kendyl wanted to go to the lake with Ryan and his sister. My dad questioned the fact that I was coming out tomarrow and that on its own hurt. But then he was telling me I was selfish for wanting to go to the lake, then Becky cut in saying her dad was coming and then my dad basically hung up on me b.c I told him that when I got back from San Antonio a month ago I made it in time to see Beckys family exept her mom whom I already met. So yeah... my day was only good for the first couple hours....

         I spent the night at Liz's house and we went to bed at around 4am. I got up at around 11am. and Ryan wanted me to go to the lake and it took about 1 hr. to get a hold of my mom to ask her. When she said yes Liz to me to Ryans and we left to go to the lake. When we got there we helped his Grampa on his new boat. His Grampa calls me CHERIO because he cant say my name.     But anyways...me and Ryan and his little sister all went swimming in the lake and he was throwing up off his shoulders it was way fun. Then Amber left so it was just me Ryan and this huge lake. So we got all close and started kissing and telling eachother that we love them, and it was so romantic.     His uncle sent us to Wal-Mart to get a fishing net. Then Ryan started to catch bait and we needed a bucket to put the bait so me and Ryan took the golf cart to the property they own and we stayed down there for a lil while "looking" for a bucket. lol. yeah  we kissed.....alittle....    Then on the way back to the house I wanted to drive the cart so Ryan let me and we were being goofy and I went to go on this little off ramp and Ryan was like "No we have to get back!" so I swerved the cart and almost landed in this ditch were there was spikes in it. If you think that is bad wait til I tell you what happend after that. We were back at the house and I was going through this little short cut and as I pasted in front of his aunts house (she has this tree and flowers all around with bricks surrounding it)so I hit the bricks thus making me hit all her flowers. Nobody was around so I hoped out of the cart and made it look normal agian. So know Ryan wont let me drive the cart anymore...wonder why Iam a great driver....hrmmm...     Then we went and we at hot dogs with chili and then we went home. On the ride home I sat close to Ryan and layed down on his leg and I talked to him for a while and then I ended up falling asleep. We got to my house at around 11:30pm and I tried to get him to stay but my mom said no. So he left. Then when he got home he called me and we talked until 2am or so. So yeah that was my day and it was FUN! hehe...

      Well the other day I started breaking out into these little red things. I looked it up on the internet and it looked like skin cancer. I went to the doctor and she said that it wasnt cancer that it was a real rare virus. I cant even spell it. But there isnt anything to worry about.  When we went to Kendyls cheer show offs she was so awesome...well I almost fell down the stairs and it was not funny...(ok maybe a little funny) Then after Kendyls cheer off we went home. Ryan came home with me and I started crying about everything. It was so silly but at the time it wasnt. I was crying about EVERYTHING! My mom asked me if I wanted some night night medicine. I told her yeah but that she had to take Ryan home at 11pm. She told me that Ryan didnt have to go home. So Ryan ended up staying the night and he layed with me and I fell asleep in his arms. It was so sweet!  I woke up this morning with Ryan nuggling next to me. (No he did not sleep with me) Then me and him watched Saturday morning cartoons and we made breakfast. It was cool. Then we went to his house and was just hung out.  I went home and got ready for work and 10min. before I had to leave. So he was telling me to have a good day at work. It was so cute. hehe. I love Ryan so much.  Work was boring I got to use the cash register and it was nifty. Well Iam leaving. Night Night people.

      Today I talked to Ryan. No not my Ryan but Ryan Fig. He and I were talking about why Iam not friends with that stupid bitch Liz. I told him my story (The right story not the lies that Liz tells) So Ryan brought up the old story about me and James. So I was pissed that he brought it up. So I told him what Liz was saying to James. She was all telling him to take off his clothes and stuff. So whatever the truth is out. Iam done trying to keep things in for her. So she can just go fuck off and do whatever the fuck she wants. Iam so through.

      Today I went to Kendyls cheer thing and when I asked how much I was going to get paid the Cheer director said she wouldnt pay me....this pissed me off...so Iam not helping any more. But anyways...I took Kendyl to cheer practice and then picked her up at 8 pm.     Ryan had called me and wanted me to play pool with him and Tony. So I asked my mom and she said NO! Then I finally got a yes. I hadnt seen Ryan in forever! (3 days) and I missed him. So I didnt play pool but they did. I watched Ryan win and loose. Mostly win though. hehe.     I started to get sick from all the smoke and with Ryans last dollar he bought me a drink...awee.....he is so sweet!    Then Ryan went with me to get gas in my car. We went for a 'lil make out session too. hehe. Not for long like 5 min. I had to go I was in a rush. Then I dropped Ryan back off with Tony. As I drove off I told Ryan I loved him and he said I love you to. As I drove off I heard a girl say Aweee.... it made me smile.     You know Iam so lucky to have a boyfriend as great as Ryan. He is the best thing that has happend to me. I love him sooo much!     g'night!

      Hey today I had to go to Kendyl's cheer thing....so I got home around 4:45 and then me and Ashley went to Chilis ad then we went to the mall. She bought some clothes and we got hit on...yeah it was funny. When we got to my house we wanted to watch Eurotrip but it wasnt playing so we watched Sacry Movie 3! It was sooo funny.     Then I was on my sn and I put up a really mean away message directed toward Liz and so she threated to call the cops on me...agian. So when I talked to my mom she said have her call the cops. I took the away message down because I didnt want to lower myself to her level. So about 30 min. later her dad calls and is telling my mom that I am blowing things out of proportion and my mom said the same to him about Liz.     Iam so sick of this crap and Iam through with our friendship. I have other friends.     Well I love Ryan soo much!!!    Bye Bye!

      Today I called Liz after she left me a nasty message on my aim. So I called her and we got into it. So after I got off the phone with her I found out her sn password. So later that night that stupid Bitch called the cops on me. At one in the fucking morning I get a call from the police telling me htat Liz had called the cops. They couldnt do anything about it so I just gave them her sn password. All she is, is a little fucking chicken. But Iam not lowing myself to her level. g'bye!

      After that little fight with Liz I was really mad. Iam not going to let her ruin my day.     I went into work for a few hours and then I came home to an 18 month old baby and a lil 3 year old. I had to babysit for my mom while she was helping out a friend with work. Ashley called me and told me she was back in town so she was going to come over after she did some things. So...Ryan and Tony call me and want to hang out so I tell then to come on over. They helped play with the baby even though Ryan made her cry. When the baby left Tony and Ryan wanted me to go play pool with them So I called up Ashley and we all had it planned.....Then my mom tells me I have to baby sit Kendyl, that my mom was going to a concert. So I had to have Kendyl find someone to spend the night with. She did. Then.... we took Kendyl to her friends house and then we all met up back at my house....    Ashley got a call from Jesse wanting her to come over there. I was like ok if you want to. I didnt care I totally understood that she wanted to see her boyfriend after she had been gone for a while. Then Ryan and Tony leave me there with Ashley. So we go to Jesse's and we are there for about 15 min. I tell Ashley that I need to go up to Lizards. So we go....    When we get there, there was alot of people. So me and Ashley talk about things that happend. And yes of course I tell about her that 2 faced bitch Liz. Then after we get done "Talking behind" Liz's back we find better things to talk about. So then Tony gave me 5$ so that I could go eat some food. I was starving. I love Tony he is so sweet.     When Ashley left guess who shows up? Tiffany Sanchez the other 2 faced bitch...I was ok with her before Liz told me Tiffany was talking behind my back. So I was nice to her I said hello. The whole time she was giving me these looks. I even invited her to my house to hang out with Tony (Because Ryan told me to invite her I realy didnt want to) So as we were leaving she gives me one last dirty look. So I go off. I start yelling at her. She walked away but hey that is ok because Ryan was pulling me into the car.     So then we left Lizards and we came back to my place ate some chips and hung out then the boys had to leave. And that was about it.

      Well... everyone who reads this knows that me and Liz are fighting. Well Iam so done with her shitty friendship.     She wants to say that I was never a good friend to her. Fuck that. I was an awesome friend and she knows it. I bent over backward for her and for Ryan. But you know what she rarly did a damn thing for me. So I just want to say that Liz Waltrip is a backstabing minipulative 2 faced girl at Sachse High School.     So fuck her and friendship. I have a better friend and her name is Ashley Vickers. She has been there more for me in the past 9 months I have known her closly then Liz was the past 2 years we were so called "Best Friends". I love you Ashley! hehe... Well know I now who my true friends are...    It seems to me that I always get hurt when it comes to good friends. I dont know what I do. I am an awesome friend to people who need me or to my friends. It seems like all my so called "true friends" stab me in the back. The one though that prolly hurt the most was my all time best brother and my ex. so called Best friend Ashley Aiken. I wont go into detail about it but...Wow...that one hurt the most....    Oh well...seems like Liz is another Ashley Aiken maybe they should be best friends they are both backstabers...

      This morning me and my mom and my little sister all went to have a girls day out. We went to Sam Moon and we bought some things I got a new purse and some toe rings and my sister got some cheer stuff.     After that we went to Target to get some candy for Kendyls cheer group and we also ate some NaChO's! lol.     When I got home I saw some really rude messages on the computer that Liz left me while I was away. Yeah she had no right to say what she said to me...She thought I was talking behind her back (Like she did to me and Ryan) But I wasnt I was writing in MY journal so if she doesent want to read it then she doesent have to. She is prolly reading it now so...Liz if you are reading this you are prolly getting mad but Iam not talking behind your back... But anyways...atleast now I know who my true friends are...Ashley where are you?! Come home form Chicago I miss you!     But anyways I wont let HER ruin my day. I havnt talked to Ryan today but IAm sure I will later! Well that is about all...

      Yesturday was mine and Ryans 1 year. It was the best night of my life...Lemme tell you about it.    Me my mom and my sister all had to go to my work so I could get my schedual and so Kendyl could pick out clothes for the fashion show she is in. Eka had a job interview but he went and got Ryan too and brought him to my house. I had asked Liz if she would do it for me (bring Ryan to my house) because she had told she would help me out since I helped her and Ryan out with one of their dates...but she threw a fit and told me the favor I did was mostly for Ryan....yeah dont even get me started a true friend would never do that. But hey I know now who my true friends are. But any ways.....    On my way home I called to see if Ryan was at my house and he was. It wasnt how I planned exactly I wanted to everthing my self but Ryan helped me cook dinner and then I locked him in my room so that I could decorate the kitchen all romantic. When I was done we sat down for a nice romantic dinner.     Ryan had told me that he didnt have enough money for roses for me....I said that was ok but really I was a little sad.  Then in the middle of dinner he got up and went to the other room and brought me back 2 dozen pink and yellow roses...OMG they were beautiful. I cried and told him that I loved him...It was awesome!    After dinner we went into my room and watched some t.v. and 'nuggled with eachother...He told me he loved me and he wanted to spend forever with me...awee...I Love him so much!    Then we got our dessert. He bought a little cheese cake. So we went into my room and we ate it and it was so cute. Then we 'nuggled some more. When 11pm came around he had to leave so I dropped him off at home.     It was the best night ever!

Me and Ryan got into a fight at his house. I was goofing off and I messed up his room and he got REAL mad. So I left his house and I actually made it all the way to mine.     But anyways Ryan came to my house and we made up. Then we had to go get Eka from work. As we were driving we saw a hitch hiker. It was so funny...When we got to Calzones I found out that the "Hitch hiker" was EKA! lol. It was so funny. So we got Eka and then we went home.    Me and Ryan went up to Lizards and Ryan was telling me that one of his Ex girlfriends had asked  him if he was still with me. He said yes of course and that little skank bitch said OH DAMN! I was so mad! But when I got to Lizards she wasnt there.     Me and Ryan got bored at Lizards so we came to my house and watched t.v and then he went home!

When we all met back up I ended up seeing Ryan Fig. it was a hi, bye kinda thing. So me and Sami and Renee all went to ride the log ride. Then we went and rode boat ride that swings up and&nbsp;down. Ryan and the rest of the group saw&nbsp;us and Ryan waited for us.  &nbsp; Me and Ryan got into some fights but we were ok I was just in a mood I guess. But everything worked out. &nbsp; Then&nbsp;me and Ryan went&nbsp;to&nbsp;ride the BATMAN!&nbsp;How sweet me and my man riding the batman.

Jesse called us and wanted us to go up to Brandon Tates house to look and talk about cars....oohhh ahhhh...So we said sure and we went over there. Ryan called me and was upset that I went over there. But then we talked everything out and everything was A-ok! When we got there Jesse really didnt spend time with Ashley we went to play with tha cars. So when we left he asked Ashley for a hug and she started to walk off. Then she was like ooooo kkkkk give me a hug! Jesse told her NO! As we were walking off everyone was telling Jesse to give her a hug. I looked at Ashley min. before we were about to leave and told her Jesse was coming. They made up and kissed! Aweee....  So we went to her house and we tried to watch the Secret Window but we fell asleep. Well Church here we come!

         Today I woke up late this morning. I was suposed to get up at 10:30 and be at Ryans at 11:30 because we were going to Main Event at 12 with Renee and Jeff. Well after we left the house I had to go turn in some applications and then it was off to Ryans. Ryan had some unfinished chores he had to do so we waited for him to do them . Then we left and it was off to get Renee and Jeff. We got them and then we went to Main Event. when we got there bowling was to much money. So we eneded up playing alot of games. Me and Ryan played air hocky and he beat me. Then we took some pictures in the booth but we didnt know it was taking our pictures so they were all of us kissing.      Me being a brat was telling Ryan that I wished we had taken goofy pictures. So being as sweet as he is and having a spoiled girlfriend he went and we took more. Then when we were done the pictures came out cute as can be. We then played another game of air hocky and this time I won! hehe...I think he let me...but who cares I still won. ME and Renne played ans I won that game too. She just sucked. lol.     Then Ryan tried to win me a BIG spongebob stuffed animal but he was unlucky that is ok though I love him and the sponge bob was hard to get.      After that we dropped REnee and Jeff off and me and Ryan left. On the way home Ryan was hungry so he stopped at Taco Bell. Knowing that I was on a diet he bought goood foood. That was ok I didnt even ask for a bite! We came back to my house rented THE WASH and ate dinner. Then he left and I was sad. But before left he showed Kendyl how to do a cart wheel. MAN WAS IT CUTE! hehe...well its off to bed. G'night!

Then when he left my mom IMed me and was like so where is Ryan? So yeah...It was gay she might have said yes.Then I was on the computer talking with my other friend Ryan and my Ryan got on my screen name...and I told my friend to tell me "I LOVE YOU" and Ryan saw it. He had done it to me in the past so. But anywaya....        I went on the internet to find somethings to make for dinner for mine and Ryans 1 year (1 week and 5 days!) and this is what I found...SHRIMP ALFREDO! Ryan likes shrimp so I hope he will like it. Iam still trying to figure out what to have for dessert. But it's going to be fun.     Me and Liz I guess got into it agian sorta. She had told me a few days ago that when the whole pool hall thing happened Ryan F. wanted to leave just as bad as she did. So I asked her about it today because I heard he wanted to stay. When I mentioned it she told me he never mentioned it to her and then she put up an away message. Iam real confused about somethings...

Ashley came over and we had girl talk because she was going through hard boys times. Then today I went to my S.A.T classes and they were boring as usual. My dad came and got me then we went to get Ryan and we went home and watched a movie...it was an old '80s movie. Then  my dad went to church and me and Ryan and Renee and our cousin Jeff were there. Me and Ryan were watching t.v. and we sucked face for a while...hehe... So yeah that was my day! hehe...It was alright.

         Well where do I start? My forth of July was SO AWESOME! We left friday morning early and I slept most well...all the way to the lake. When we got there we all hung out with his aunt and we waited for more people to get there. His Uncle Ronny was there with his kids and man were they cute. Me and Ryan took them swimming and then some kind of fish spider jumped on my back. Then we went back to the house and his Uncle made hamburger steaks...HOLY COW they are soo good.        I slept at Ronnys trailer with his little girl that night and then the morning of the 3rd I went and woke up Ryan. We all went out on the boat and we went on the tube. Man it was so fun! I asked his uncle to go easy on me and not to go fast because I didnt want to fall in the middle of the lake. So the whole time I didnt fall off. But wow you should've Ryan he was so awesome. He was doing flips and all sorts of cool shit on the tube. When we went in me and Ryan helped cook chicken on the grill and make a big fire. The whole weekend Ryan was getting into trouble and getting things blamed on him so he was a little cranky but he got over it and still had fun. Then I had to bribe Ronny in letting me stay agian in his trailer and guess what? I got to! hehe...     The next morning was the 4th and he had more of his family coming in. One of his little cousins who was like 10 years old was trying to play footsees with me while we were watching Along Came Polly. Yeah he was a little flirty and it was REAL annoying. It only got worse when his other cousin who was 14 came into the picture. He was pretty flirty too. But you know I had Ryan with me the whole time so everything was all good. We went tubing agian today and his aunts boyfriend took us. we were out for 3 hours and let me tell you this guy didnt care if I wanted to go slow. I got knocked off and I started to swim to the boat. They then told me that I shouldnt swim to the boat because they couldnt see me. I went on about 4 more times and all 4 times I fell or flipped off.      The fireworks were awesome. His uncle went and got like 550$ worth. Me and Ryan shot all them off and one busted and it was a big one. Nobody got hurt though. Then we left the lake and came home...and I cant sleep so I thought I would write.       That was my FUN FILLED WEEKEND!  Night Night
