      just finish watching it, not what i have expected from it, initially thought was just another poor guy caught in the middle of a cross fire at the wrong place and at the wrong time, but it turn out to have more depth than other films in the same genre. it encompass the night of a taxi driver who accidentally have a passenger at the back of his car which turns out to be a professional hit man, yes ladies and gentlemen, introducing ....hollywoods golden boy Tom Cruise. the conversations between the two were funny and witty but at the same times consists the harsh truth of reality in the city we live in today. it may not be L.A here, but same things happen in every corner of the streets, only different level of seriousness.  in their conversation, tom cruise say that a man dies in a MTA, which i guess is something similar to our LRT, only be realized and found after a long time, i forgot how long was it. i could relate to that, as it reminds me of my days in kl apiit, i see all sorts of people walking by, brushing shoulders with me, we dodge each other and never have eyes contact...we are all too preocuppied with our things to realized there are sufferings and pain arround us.  one scene from the movie gave me an deep impression, where a wolf crossed the street just infront of their taxi, both of them with wonder and confuse expression on their faces, it seems like the director is trying to tell the audience the loneliness of tom cruise, regardless what is his occupation, he is a predator, like a wolf, yet not belongs to the city but the woods. we are all the same, we are all predators of our own society, we grab and snatch every opportunity we sees, we raise up as we step on the weaks, kill and destroy anyone who steps in our way, then, in the end... we lost ourselves...

      i haven't actually done anything untill now, so many homework waiting for me to be done, but i ignore it. i'm confused and dazed, i don't know why do i have this kind of attitude, why am i so lazy? i just couldn't concentrate on my studies. oh GOd, please help me to go through this time of desparation and confusion, help me think clearly with Your wisdom and grace. please be with me and help me walk through the valley of death.   i cried, i cried because i felt lonely, the reason was i can't do my things properly, i tried to occupy my mind with homework but i fail, the more i indulge myself in stories and novel, the more lonely i felt. i don't want to feel lonely, i know God is always with me, and i'm really grateful to know Him at such a young age.  i want to change, i don't want to be a failure, not because of anyone but for God, sacrifice must be made, i must learn to have more concentration on whatever i'm doing, just do my best and leave no regrets. i really hope i can change...

      i'm gonna sleep now, this is the earliest night i have went to bed this week :p hope i can wake up tomorrow and drive the van. and i pray to God that i really can finish doing my homework and PSF, and don't mess up any opportunity that is given to me, time and space.  i'm thinking of photography lately, sometimes i felt boredom is overwhelming me, trapt in a small room with nothing to do, though i actually have alot of things to do, i tend to ignore them, i hope i would not repeat this mistake again. i hope i have the time to find relaxation and serenity through photography.  taking still picture of nature and human's natural reactions would be my main focus :) sometimes i feel sick of looking at people's photo cause they just pose and try to show thier "best" infront of the camera, very fake, hypocrites, i would rather take photos of grass and flowers, which are real and lifely.

      just finish watching 13 going on 30, thought it was just some ordinary comedy love story which just with a little twist in time and space, it was true, but what i didn't expect was it actually touch my heart! it reminds me of the good old days in secondary school, with my gang of friends, study, eat, play and St.John together! i never had friends like them after that.  as time moves on, we all went separates ways, we have our own lives in different places, what still bind us together are the sweet and bitter memories that we have been through together. i miss those days, when we are young and care free, nothing really serious to worry about. i know i won't get back those days anymore, but i wish to find back those kind of feeling again. to feel excited to do new things, to not feel daunted by challenges, unashamed to make mistakes, and courage to seek for higher ground, to break free from the streotype, to search for our dreams that we now have and not intimidated by changes.  i really miss those st.johns' days, those were one of the best days of my life, i'll never forget it, it will be cherish forever in my heart. hope to spend more time with them one day.

      this morning, while i was waiting for cecilia to come out from her house, a car passed by me. it was those old cars....daihatsu or toyota, which i can't tell the difference, it was light brown, 20 years old i guess, with patches of rusted steel scattered on the car's body...it was old, antique.  one thing came my mind, the car gave me the impression of poverty, low class and insignificance, given the chance i would have sold it if it was mine!  in the car sits two little cute kids, cute and innocence, they were on their way to kingdergaden, very cheerful in the morning, they remind me of how unimportant materials are as we often so eager to obtain in our life, get a car...get a big car...get a big and classy car...with turbo engine...V6...whatever bloody engine that is powerful enough to show of on the road wven though you are not gonna drive that fast! get a house...get a banglo....get a fucking condo....get a job...have a career....get paid...get laid.... these are things we strive for!  i hope can have the innocence of youth. be real...be sincere...be what you are...when are we gonna see through ourselves? i guess this is a life long lesson for us to learn..no break..no recess..no time out :)

      yesterday soong ask me what would i change if i had the chance to make my life better...i ask her back..how do you define a better life? is it having all the things we ever wanted would make our life better? having all the material things we could ever afford or ever finish using? having your dream girl becoming your gf? to have a career which make 100k annually? or even monthly?  trying not to sound religious but sincere... i reply her and said: i would want to improve my relationship with God, i guess that is the most important thing and the hardest thing to achieve. come to think of it.. i won't achieve it but would learn to be more godly along the road of life... sometimes men are selfish...though we know what is right and wrong, we still tend to do the wrong cause it bring us pleasure. we all have sin.. i have sin...  oh pls God..forgive me...i'm worthless in front of you. yet you have sent Jesus Christ from heaven to save us from our sins.. thank you God!  i really hope to do something different in my life.. to help people, poor people..sick people.. people in dire straits.. instead of helping companies and corporates to earn more money, that would sucks!only thing i need to do is to be brave and face obstacles and make sacrifices to do so... we all have too many burdens and resposibles in this life that doesn't do anyone else good except ourselves.

      feel like not doing anything but rest... the thesis really is a burden that is in my mind all the time. there is so many homework to do but i just couldn't have the heart to do it. what is happening to me? i should be doing my homework rather than writing this blog! am i pretendtious? am i a hypocrite like all the others that i thought to be hypocrite? i feel confused sometimes.  damn.. i'm really tired.. got to take some rest and tomorrow morning i'll do my best, i hope i can put all my effort in my homework, cause is my responsibility.

      Haha, today i finally learn how to publish my photo with the Hello software! my God it was so easy but i took me few hours to figure out how exactly to put my photo on to the blog. right now, i still don't know how to put a picture on the profile :p, hope i learn soon.... i learn things pretty slow.  slept the whole afternoon, feel rejuvenated... but depressed at the same time, cause when u sleep, is like going to another dimension, a new world where no one would bother you!(execpt for nightmares! haha) but when you wake up, no matter how much slept you've got, welcome back to reality :( there are loads of things waiting for us to do. i'm not a slacker, is just that the strike of reality is kind of cruel to me.  well, no matter how, i believe God would lead me through any obstacles in my life, which currently i have alot! :( pray!
