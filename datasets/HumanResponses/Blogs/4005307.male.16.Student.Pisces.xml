      It's 7:30am and we are doing laundry.  We have a few more things to nab before we bounce the pond but it looks like the day will be a good one to fly.  RIC (richmond, virginia) to DTW (Rock City, Detroit) will be our first flight a little after 4:00pm.  From there, we have a lazy layover of about 4 hours before we take to the skies to start our global voyage.  Rogue 2

      It has been a good Saturday.  We started this morning with the traditional English breakfast including sausages and tomatoes.  (baked beans too)  Then we went to Brighton to participate in the conference before running off to see more stone circles (could not find them), a castle (which is closed on Saturdays) and finally Chitchester Cathedral.   We returned to Brighton for the closing celebrations and heard pipers and a choir from Kenya......pretty cool, and also a singer.....yawn.  Anyway, we are off on Sunday to a paintball tourney.  We did swing by one field today and met a famous guy who used to play on a famous team.....he thought quite highly of himself.  Jake is honing his accent.    D and J

      Plane left Detroit at 940 Wednesday we got the center aisle and the first row so we had some extra leg room. The flight was  long and really boring but we landed an hour early on thursday so we got through customs without any trouble and got our luggage and got our Migane car. IT could fit in the back of the office van. We then drove to Brighton and Uncle Doug spoke at 2 work shops. We stayed at a B&B which was good because i fell asleep on the job twice now were back to do another 3 workshops. End of transmission!

      Today has been fun.  We sprung for a Holiday Inn Express last night so that meant a great shower, no wacky B&B owners trying to feed us boiled fish for breakfast (kippers), and nice soft beds!  We then saw the 2000+ year old Roman Baths in Bath, England.  Jolly good time!  We picked up some Aqua glass for Cindy (it's a secret, so don't tell her) and then we hit Firth Castle.  It was cool.  From there, we went to Stonehenge and looked at big rocks and then on to Woodhenge where we saw a few people making out.  We just came from the Aveary Mansion and its multiple stone circles and they were big rocks too.  Jake is enjoying all of the culture except the paintball fields are few and far between.  It seems to be more a bachelor party thing than a team sport.  We are now on the road to Oxford where Jake is planning on interviewing for one of the PhD programmes.  (notice the two m's, per the English influence on us by this time)  I expect that we will go to an Ibis hotel on the way.  But for the time being, we just enjoyed some McDonalds - silly, I know but sometimes you need comfort food.  We are well.  We have loads of photos and I have not let Jake spend all of my money yet.......  Cheers! D
