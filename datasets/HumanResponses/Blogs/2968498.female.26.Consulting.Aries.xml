      Finding #1 I am really not a shopping girl. How often do you find a woman who despise shopping.  Fact #1 Never never never buy products that you are not familiar with. And never be too lazy to go look for what you want.  Finding #2 You are really a cow in the head. Really geram with your cow-ness at times.  Prediction #1 I am going to have diarrhea because I cooked today nyahahahaha.....  Memoir #1 Awww... I really miss my cheese macaroni days.

      So, please don't go back to work. I seriously think I need to chill. Well, you have not go for a holiday for 4.5 years already, so at least take your Sunday off, woman.   This is the plan for the day:  Wake up. Clean yourself. Clean the room. Feed the pets. Go get some food. Go shopping. Get dinner. Come back. Chat. Clear your personal documents. Chat. Go to bed. Hmmm...  Can I tell you I am missing someone here. I really do. I don't know why. It's not like I have not seen him for a very long time.   I dreamt a lot of stuff last night. I think that is why I am having troubled sleep and ending up feeling like crap every morning. The brain just won't rest.   Hmmm... yesterday on the road I saw that boy. I can't remember his name. The one who bought me chocolates last year. Was with a girl walking from Bukit Bintang to Petaling Street. Hmmm...  My head hurts.

      I have not been this exhausted for a very long time. Having lunch in the car and attempted to sleep while driving. My gawd. If it wasn't the mosquitos I think I would be knocked out till dawn.  With this job I think I am getting old really fast. Can you believe it has past 6 months already? Just like that. Blink of an eye. It's really scary. Really really.  This week is an unhealthy week. Nothing really much happened aside work. I want to go out but I am just too tired. Damn. There goes my effort to look hard for a rich pampering husband.  I think I am hungry now. But am too lazy to get dressed to get food. Aaahhh... nothing new.

      Do you remember the days when you make little surprises just to get someone smiling? I thought I almost forget that already. But I guess that things just never change. You are what you are.  Forgot to kiss you good night.  Bei.  Spoke to Kin San to see whether we could get together next week. As usual he just sounded exhausted. Felt a bit sakit hati also. But there is so little that you can do.  I didn't really hear what my honey bunny said. I think he said something about go update my blog. But one thing I heard clearly was thank you. * (:| *  Something just doesn't feel right tonight. You know that feeling, you sit not right, you stand not right, you lie down also not right... I don't really know what it is...   Just now I was taking pictures of myself.  My gawd, I have put on so much weight! I blamed it on the hair.

      If I am going to bitch about work one more time, I am think I might as well go commit suicide. The nightmares are really killing my sanity. Really really. But today (just oneeeee more time :P) is a stressful day as well, just like any other day.  My point is, when I came back home, it was late. Then he came online. And I felt calm and collected again. Then I am thinking, to have someone in your mind IS really really important. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to move my focus to somewhere else.  I remembered I was asking Derric, does he know anyone who is looking for a freelance relationship right now. Chinese. Male. Age 28 and above. Status single/married/engaged/divorced/attached. Man, I do have a lot of screwed up relationships in my life!  Right now I have a plan. I am going to focus to get someone to marry me. So that I can stay at home and be fat :} Isn't that like my focus 5 years ago? =\ Look where I am right now.   You know what. Some years ago I was reading an interview with Shaz and she was saying things like she is single and totally screwed up in relationships. This morning I was listening to the radio, this woman now is happily married and going to have a kid. That really amazes me.  I still couldn't believe nobody wants to propose to me. Damn it.

      I was craving for bah kut teh. Then there is no bah kut teh. Have to settle with Pork soup =\ Today I saw my pei-tan-chai again. Aiyoh... he looks cuter everytime I sees him. I wonder what is his name. I suspect the g-yuk-fan aunty noticed I am checking him out hahaha... basket.  Anyway, today was a horrible day at work. Tonnes and tonnes of work. And the server is down. Grrr... got fed up and came back home. I am proud =)  This morning I got up, got into my working suit as usual, take my LV bag and in my high heels all walked out to the lift with my car keys in my hand. Then I realised again I am such a typical executive. Which disgusted myself - eeyuck.  Speaking of eeyuck, I called Konica Wilson to say hi. Aiyo... he is such an adorable kid. We were just chatting and laughing. He is forever so cheery.  Keep-In-View called last night. He still remembers he owes me crabs and lobsters. LOL. Even I don't remember that already.   Hmmm... sun is setting. Getting dark again.

      I can't collect stories from strangers anymore. I think I am just too old for that already. I am beginning to believe that I am a really picky person.  Children really amaze me. They just have all the time and energy in the world to do it.   Just one more game. And I will get ready to go to bed :P

      Isn't there a movie named like that too? Hmmm...  When I was driving home, there were so many thoughts in my mind what I want to write in my blog tonight. What I want to say and how I want to say it. But as usual, the mind just flies away when you are sitting on it.  Fear. I believe I am growing and learning how to deal with things. At least I am not sleeping around anymore. I don't even know whether it's anger. Or it's just me. But definitely stupid.  Loath. Little girl, time to stop floating in air and come back down to earth already. Hate it when reality calls me back home. Have been losing focus lately. I don't know whether I lost my focus or it has been a blur all this while =\ Confused child.  I have a feeling that I am going to drift away again. I think I am just afraid. That I am going to hurt myself again.   And I know it hurts. I know it really does.  Guess what I downloaded? Bejeweled!! Am actually playing it right now as we are speaking here. Aaahhh... brings back the days when Bejeweled all over. Awww... I wonder how is Ah Boon and Kok Choon doing right now. My darling boys.  You know what I am going to do tonight? Let's see if I am able to start collect stories from strangers again =)  The colours that you choose to make your day =)

      I remembered this is one of the titles that I am really fond of writing when I was in school. Tbe battle between sex and morals. And I knew nothing about sex back then. Hmmm...  Last night had a migraine attack again. Has been some time already he didn't visit me. My baby had the night off, but I just couldn't take the headache. And I went to sleep. Without pain killers. I am proud. Then, Patrick called. This is how the conversation went:  Me: Patrick... Pat: Hey, you on the phone or something? Can't get through your handphone. Me: Yeah, switched it off. Migraine. Pat: You are still sick! The last time I called you, you are sick. Me: Oh the flu. Got well from the flu already. Pat: You taken your dinner yet? Me: Pat, what time is it already, it's 2 in the morning. Pat: Yeah, but knowing you, you would just snack and skip dinner. Biscuits and chocs are not dinner you know. I remember used to have to buy you food or take you out to eat just to make sure you eat proper meals. Me: Aaahhh... I remember. Anyway, I had a proper dinner today. So why did you call? Where are you, anyway? Pat: At home. And I am calling to say hi. Can't I? Me: No, you don't just call to say hi in 2am. Not when you are at home anyway. Pat: Hmmm... true. Was just in between breaks during the game so thought of calling you. Me: Aaahhh... football...  1 month earlier at McDonalds:  Jac: He cute woh... why don't you siong. (Sorry Jac, I can't remember the exact words you said) Me: I can't. Something is just missing. Jac: What is? You know he is good in bed already. Me: The feeling with Patrick is just not there. Same reasons I can't be with Karl.  Sigh.  Time to go bath and go to the office to work. I have a date tonight with my sweetheart to fiddle the digi cam =). Need to get back home early. With dinner, of course.

      This point of time am at the stage of demotivated.   Am having goreng pisang and keropok leko. Very nice. Am chatting with Rowena now. Separated with Gerard cause she needs to stay in Russia for long. Sigh. Distance. Long distance..... I know it's scary. I really do.  Just now in the shower I was thinking about feelings.... Feelings~ There is a song like that. What are my exact feelings for him and what are his feelings towards me? I really don't know. You know, I didn't realise it much until he fell sick. Suddenly all the feelings came haunting me. Which is pretty scary. Shivering scary.  Derric said I'm not being psychotic. Just attention craving. Always needed to know there is just somebody around for me. I still say I am psychotic =)  And Psychotic I shall remain.

      I think I worry too much. I really do.  I worry about work. I worry about my family. I worry about people who are 6000km away from me. I worry about myself. I worry about money. I worry about my rabbits. Right now, I am just really worry about work. And it is really eating me. I think I am beginning to hate my job. Value engineering my boss taught me.  Derric always tell me, keep your head level up. Don't go hope for stupid things. I really hate him for saying things like that to me. First night after 2 months with him every night across the Internet. I saw this coming already.   You know what I did during the movie. Menangis. Bukan apa. Tiba-tiba terfikir dia sakit. Worried sick. Aiyo. This is definitely not healthy. Feel like giving myself a tight slap! Bikuspid! Stupid Stupid, I still remember that hahahaha.... Allen really lost a lot of weight. Getting married soon I heard. Everybody is getting married except me =/  Anyway, just puked in the toilet. I think it's the worry too much acid in the stomach theory. Don't think it's food poisoning. Hate this when I have this creepy feeling.  I am definitely not feeling good tonight.

      If they are going to tell me that I don't love them, I am really going to smack them and then cry.   Work is really stressing me out. Reports reports and more reports. Plannings reports, plannings, reports. Plans, plans, plans. Promoters, promoters, promoters. ARGHHHHHHHH!!  Jac, you know I will not dump Kin San even if he is wearing lacy underwears!! Basket. Called him last night to chase him to go home. Again. That is my sweet temp =)  My sweetheart is sick tonight. But he still has the energy teasing me and my pillow, so that couldn't be that bad. But then again, he chose orange juice over beer, now that worries me.  You know, last night I really had a lot in mind to write but I just couldn't remember.  I think I am getting old. Fast.

      Charles messaged me, inviting me for drinks. I think he is being traumatised by Rachel again.  Kam Loong messaged me saying he wants to come over. I told let's see whether could meet up with him this Friday or something. Not very enthusiastic.  Husky called last night, saying he is hungry. Told him am too lazy to get up and we'll see when we could meet up for dinner.  Daniel called. Saying going out this Friday also. Have to see.  Ben Chong called for dinner too.  Lance messaged for dinner also. Flowers would be included. Hmmm...  Called Tiam Bok. He is getting strange. He told me not to get involve with anyone cause he wants me. Freaky.  Paul Loo is in the ignore list already. He still couldn't get it!  Andrew Tan sounded depressive the last time I spoke to him. Poor kid. But there is nothing much I can do but to talk to him. Which I did.  And Karl... sigh. Don't even want to talk about him. He is complaining already that I don't have time to see him anymore, lol. Big time.  Haven't seen Darren for a while. Was screaming at him about my car insurance last. His birthday present is still in my car.  Kimberly called me Perempuan Anti Sosial cos I didn't attend her outings with Steven =P  Jac... haven't seen that woman for a while either. She is still currently being traumatised by Sicpa.  Doris called to tell me Vun Yap Ming died in a car accident. Errr...  Patick... too busy with work, just like me. Last spoke to him was about Edzuan. Now, THAT is sad!  And I am planning to strip tonight =P

       "Why do birds, Suddenly appear? Everytime you are near, Just like me, They long to be, Close to you. Why do stars, Fall down from the sky? Everytime you walk by, Just like me, They long to be, Close to you."   I cried. Damn.  I hate the feeling of being helpless.

      I was telling Kin San, I have a temporary boyfriend who is a workaholic and another boyfriend who is 6000km away. I had to turn around to the office while I was on my way home already because nobody had the keys to lock up. And then... he interrupted, you have a boyfriend 6000km away? Already? I am sad. Hmmmm....  And he never returned my messages already.

      I cannot get him out of my head. These few days have been thinking about him. I don't really know whether I should feel sad for myself, or empathise. That was why I said, it's not really the right feeling to start a new blog, but I just couldn't help it.  One of my girls came to see me today and bought me cakes. She just couldn't stop thanking me for finding her a job. That kept me floating for a while.   I think I am depressed. Something is really getting into me and as usual, I don't want to find out what is it. Am afraid to know. Gary would tell me, girl, you cannot run away from your problem all the time, you know. I know. Blame it on the hormornes.  When I was chatting with ... you know, I always have a trouble with names =P. Anyway, I was chatting with you know I know (=P), that moment of time, there was nothing much on my mind. It's actually quite peaceful. Until that night. Sigh. Sad.  I need someone to tickle me.

      Not suppose to start a new blog with thoughts like this but I really couldn't help it.   Sigh.  Remember the guy from Holland? It's bringing back all the memories. These days, everytime I got out from the shower after washing my hair, I would think of him. I wonder where is he scuba diving right now, aaahhh... I still remember he scuba dives...  That reminded me of the toe. I remembered that was one painful injury. Which reminds me of Ben. Aaahhh... Ben oh Ben oh Ben... wondering does he have kids now. Though it has been gazillion ages already but he still gets into me. Damned that Rolex Ring! I will never forgive him for that, and Jac would tell you WOMAN HE IS INNOCENT! No, he is not :P  Nothing much has been happening lately. It's either work, or I would just come home and chat with him. Nothing much that is happening in between. It's just like the old peaceful days. Days that you miss so much =)  I don't feel good.

      I can't believe I am actually on leave. Wow... &nbsp; I had the most weird dream. But then again I always have weird dreams. Remember Ben? Damn, that dream screwed me up for years and I am still traumatised with that!! &nbsp; Anyway, I dreamt&nbsp;I was dating Mr. Alien Chang hahahahaha..... MY GAWD! Finally! That dream is so scary not because of him, because of what had happened. Same thing what happened as last night. I am a pain in the ass, aren't I? Anyway, so there I was, running away (as usual, what's new) and he came screaming at me and it so turned me on. I am beginning to believe I am a sadist.&nbsp; Jealousy is always funny thing to me. Biggest compliment that you can get. &nbsp; Anyway, Mr. Alien Chang is getting married next year. Wow... that is really something. I just wonder how much sex he is having right now hahaha..... I do miss him at times. Hummmm..... &nbsp; Good morning =)

      Yeah.... crushed. I don't really know what to say.  &nbsp;  When I read that email, my heart stopped for a while. Couldn't understand why. And I came back home and I looked at him and all I can feel was crushed.&nbsp; Bothered.  &nbsp;  And suddenly, I felt something was lost. Now that really scares me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  The other day when we were shopping for Lina's gift, there was this crystal that we saw which was really nice to reduce daydreaming. The girls thought the gift was not appropriate cause Lina is not the daydreaming type and they looked at me. Yeah, I needed that crystal much much more than she does.  &nbsp;  I dream too much. But to me it's not a dream. I always tell myself it's real, it's going to be real, I'm going to make it real. It's real. And today..... it just went so unreal. And it reduced me to tears.&nbsp; &nbsp;  And all the bad memories just came back to haunt me. Just couldn't let go.&nbsp;

      I woke up and saw a red curved line from my left temple across my cheek to the left corner of my mouth. I wet my finger (wet... that is a sensitive word) and rubbed on the red line hoping to wipe it off.   Ouch.

      Yesterday I went out with Dinny. She sat with me in the salon for 5 hours! And accompanied me to do my grocery shopping and had dinner with me. Isn't just she so sweet. I look at her and all I can see is Kin San. They are just so fit with each other. I really need to hook them up to know. If and only if I can get Kin San out of the office =/  I heard something crushing today. My feet was being pulled back to ground again today. Not only that, was being watered and fertilised to plant roots to them as well! I am so going to hate him for that.   I need food.

      Knowing he would read this entry I wouldn't know how to write this =) But I remember I did tell myself when I gave him the address that I will not withhold my thoughts no matter what. Hummm... really now...  What I want to say is that I am getting too dependant on him and it's getting really unhealthy. Every night I would come back home and expect him to be with me. If there is something that went wrong, he would be the first person I run to, even on tiny little things. Whenever he is not around, I feel a little lost. Which is so scary.  Did I tell you I told him about how I feel towards him in an email and he went speechless? My thought would be he was not able to feel the same for me. Sometimes I don't really understand what is being withheld. I think it's because they are happy with where they are or they are expecting something better, which I believe the latter applies more. Which is a bit... sad, actually.  I always tell people I am desperate seeking. And I would sit down and laugh to myself, how desperate a person could be being single for more than 2 years already =) But I really am. Just a moment ago I saw Winston. And I was thinking, you sure you want to lead him on? No... I don't want to be with him actually. Something that I learnt from Stanley, you just can't simply settle with anyone. If you want somebody, make sure you are satisfied with it and no regretting. That is like so difficult. Alien would love to call me picky, picky, picky, now that he is getting married. Damn!  I feel lonely. But it's okay. Just go watch your porns, and you would be okay =)

      Loreal Lawyer Loreal Lawyer... I remembered that clearly.  Finally managed to see Kin San. He looked really tired and stressed out. And he looks really really tired. He looked so much older now. He cut his hair. Hummm... doesn't look as good as before... I don't know.  My feelings for him is just not there anymore. Probably didn't see him for too long of a time. I asked him, so what finally determined you to come over to see me, he just said, aaahhhh.... nothing, just didn't see you already for long enough of a time, some 1 year already. 1 year already? Wow. Even the hug was so feelingless. Sad.  Patrick... I want to say something about Patrick but... I don't know. Remembered the time, we were in Tesco, and there was this girl we saw that he cared so much. And I just fell for that! He is really one bad tempered person, but really gentle. He was just nagging me the other day that I have to take care of my physical health and I was like okay okay okay... and he said what okay okay, girl it's your health and you don't even care. He is so cute at times.  And there is Stanley....
