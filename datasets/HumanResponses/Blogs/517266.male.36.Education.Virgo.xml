      Cape Haze, Florida - It has been some time since I last wrote, but I am here in Florida visiting my pledge brother from college, Matt White.  In January of 1999, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  Although it is a terminal disease, Matt has shown me how one can live through adversity and get the most life out of living.  After all, Matt chooses to live until the moment he dies.  And even then, he lives.  Spending time here is a blessing.

      North Carolina - Spoke at three schools today.  South Rowan, East Rowan and Irwin Middle School.  I don't know where to begin.  ERHS and Irwin were in their auditorium and it was an amazing group.  Tons of energy and respect.  I really appreciated being there and felt appreciated.  At SRHS, they went way out of their way to decorate the gym for the day and to celebrate ALOHA in the halls and with the students.  Although sound systems in gyms can be nuts, the audience really endured and hung in there and I really am thankful.  There is something about North Carolina that I really like.  Thanks for the hospitality.

Absolutely beautiful.

This year, we had about 40 people with amazing ideas.  The winners of the night were:  OSCAR PRIZE - Sue and Mel  BABE PRIZE - Amy from Pirates of the Carribean TINKY WINKY PRIZE - Cheryl Tocco and JANET JACKSON PRIZE - Linda Nunn!

      July 26, 2004 - Whoa.  It has been so long since I have last written here.  I have really gotten caught up in the fun of summer.  I will try to write a bit more before the school years gets rolling again.  However, I do want to write about my experience I had over the weekend.    In Noblesville, Indiana, there is a living museum called Conner Prarie Farm.  It is all about life in 1886 when Grover Cleveland was president and the Governor of Indiana was Governor Gray.  I had an opportunity to spend the entire weekend there, living as a charectar of 1886, with my two nieces Anna (a.k.a Christina Hancock) and Angelina (a.k.a. Mary Hancock) along with my sister Katie (a.k.a. Nancy Hancock.)  My name was Salathiel Hartnet.    It was an amazing time.  We worked on the farms, made our meals from scratch, fed the pigs, split wood, and enjoyed evening activities without the benefit of running water or electricity.  It was an experience of a lifetime that I am so happy to have shared with my beautiful angels.  I wish everyone could experience life in 1886.  Priceless.  (And yes, at night if you had to use the 'privy', you instead had to use a 'chamber pot' which is NOT a pot you ever want to eat out of...if you know what I am saying.)  Aloha.
