      Well, The GAH! for the title must mean something bad. YES!!! YES it does mean something bad. Spyware. We all most likely have it. And the world hates it. What shall we do to make us feel better? Let's rant! I mean, there's this new thing that puts malicious code on your computer if you visit popular websites. Then there's these other types of Spyware that change your homepage and put like porno on your computer. Are you sick of it? Go  Here!  You will find ways to get rid of most of it.   I really want to open a Mario shrine. With the emphisis on Daisy... Maybe Yun can help me, after all, he  Linked  me! We are very close cousins. We see each other almost everyday, him and his witty self.   Rachelle, thank you for being one of the few un-pessimistic friends I have left. When ever we are self-absorbed and Emo, you come and comfort us, and you have a great sense of feeling and style! You also let us swim in your pool!    AN EDITORIAL   I don't like how people say if you wear brand-name clothes that you are "preppy," and "snotty." Well, I wear Tommy Hilfiger and Polo, but I'm not either of those. No one is, unless you say you are. I get them for $10 at like Deelards and Ross. I wear them because they look nice and last long. So nyah.

      Emo children. Gah. I mean it's good that you are expressing your feelings, but in the WRONG way and to the WRONG people. I mean look in an Emo blog at  urlLink Deadjournal  or something. You see "OMG! My life sucks! I can't open my pickle jar and I'm fat!" I mean there's some people in like Africa who are dying of hunger and as skinny as a stick! Stop being self-absorbed. IF  you need to express you feelings, go to a counselor, to a friend, just not the Internet; because that way, people can rant you, become enraged, and send you Stop-Being-Emo-Mail. Then the Emo people think that their Emoness is deep. Like hell it is! They are so shallow, thinking of only therselves and not ACTUAL people who should be Emo. Get some Prozac.   Then there's all these titles that you give people and what you should listen to... Preps should have pop like Spears, Punks should listen to Punk-Rock like Evanescence, the "Gangtas" need to listen to Hip-Hop like Usher... NO! I like all genres, so where do I go? Man. But this can very since I am from a large Metro area and people in smaller places, like rural places, perhaps the preps act preppy and harass the lower class like crap. Just a suggestion.

      Well, I will have to blogging less now. Ghey Wal-Mart Connect keeps signing off. Grr.... I hope they go bankrupt in a lawsuit. So, there you have it, less blogging.   I really want PSP7. Thanks to Yun, I can get it the next time we see Rin.   This is good-bye, for now.

       TO YUNSEN:  When a went with Auntie Lucy to Tyrone Mall, we saw Kuya Ago and his Asian (girl)friend, we also saw his cousin. 100 DEGREES OF ORIENTATION! Inang almost lost her watch! Do you think that Tripod is an okay place to get hosted? Because I want to start something. There's fluoride in our water now. It helps our teeth. YAY! When we go to the Philippines, what do you want to do? Today I purchased Daddy Daycare. I hope it's a good movie.   I need GMAIL!

      We the Filipino people, are so silly... For example     We have developed an eating method with our hands.  We tell our children to not do things that we do.  We are just hypocrites. (For example, we tell our guests to bring food, yet at other places we yearn to instist to  Not  bring food.  We are so frugal... Who knew cheating Calvin Klein was so easy?  We are so smart... yet iur parents compare us to other Filipino/a classmates or other Asians.     I just cannot wait until I go to the Philipppines.

      Well, as we all know, we haven't had a sleepover in a while. Well, perhaps, we could have a sleepover, this month.   Rin, Rachelle:  Teen2, Chris, Matthew, and I are going to the Philippines. Do you want anything (besides golidlocks...lol.) We are bringing 8 boxes there and, mabe will bring 5 back...   Not much to say today... I wish someone I see a lot, is a friend on a peer basis, could drive us around, because I can't drive until I'm 18. I want a Honda Civic, or some other compact sedan-car.
