      TheInsuranceAgent was in the chat ytd. He remembered me tho... hahaha...i think agents have good memory. They will tend to remember u so long as they see the potential in u as a client but once u've signed up for their plans, thats it, they will forget u.  Ok, ok...shall not condemn much abt insurance agents.  Anyway, got this frd of mine who juz got back from Japan and guess what  did he buy for me? Errr...bra? light milky pink somemore...aiyoh...so barbie  color one...y pink of so many colors?? =( I wonder how he managed to know  my size also...nvr know that guys' eyesight are so powerful that they can  even know a girl's breast size without touching it. And gals cant tell a guy's 'ahem' size by looking at their crotch? its so unfair...lol.   But i've got a prob tho, not sure if he's gonna get the panties size rite.  If cannot fit then i guess i have to cut it into G string cos the last  time he sees me, my butt is smaller...kekeke  Will update more once i've got my present! ^_^  BTW....MICHAEL JACKSON SUCKS BIG TIME!!!

I dun bother to reply hehehe. I have phobia of insurance agents! Still remembered the  blind date that i had wif a chatter, who is also an insurance agent.  That was abt 4 -5 yrs back.  He is so persistant! That was 2 dates wif him and thats it...i wouldnt even call it a date at all! The typical lets sit at McDonald's, have a  coke and tok business kinda thing. Had to pretend to make an excuse to get out of it.   I WILL NOT GET AN INSURANCE AGENT AS A BF     5.  Music is the best stress reliever   6.  Jasmine is out of AMI...hah! finally!....she shld  be out long time ago! I miss LaToyA...awww   7.  I am not a 'MINAH' ok (malay version of Ah Lian).

Drinking lotsa milk and soyabean doesnt make the unborn child any fairer! Im a good example of it...   10.  Finally, does anybody have a cure for body odour? I need help urgently!! Effective, fast and works amazingly! Eh, btw  its not for me, its for someone else.    P/S: Someone surprised me with his call...called me at 4plus in the  morning, wake me up from my sleep...bleah :P u watch out!

      Yawnz...just woke up from a wonderful nap...  *BEEP*...5 missed call...nowadays not even the loudest ringtone can wake me up (btw yes, my ringtone is still set to Come on Eileen)  Just added a link to Gallery Hotel, wonderful place. It aint fair to  compare it with 5 Stars hotels but i simply love this place. The ambience, homey feeling plus lotsa pillows and cushions (a plus point!) makes it at  an adv over the rest. AND its within walking distance to Mohd Sultan,  good for clubbers. The disadv? Not being near to the train stn.  Will add in links to other hotels that i've been to later.  i know i know, u might go 'this siao char bor, wasting her $ go to  hotels for wat?'...hahaha i know u gonna have bad thoughts abt it but  hey this is my form of relaxation cos i dont go for holidays/overseas (for some reasons), so i indulge in this...anyway i've got $600 to  claim for :P  Will add in more things later tonite, maybe a pic or two...when im at  work later...  ciao peeps...

      Backie...  Heard something over the radio...a conversation btwn Vern and  one of the listeners...by the name of Eugene  Vern: So whats is 1 thing u like to flush out of ur sweetheart? (apparently  referring to her bad habits)  Eugene: Her lateness  Vern: *lol* whats the longest time u've waited for her?  Eugene: 2 hrs  Hmmm...sounds familiar eh? At least i didnt make a guy wait for me till that  long...ahahah...or perhaps not yet? Remembered making 'someone' angry  cos i was late...but ive got my reasons!! and its not the typical  'i take a long time to do my make-up/dress up' kinda reason.  BUT...but...i guess the worst habit was i've ever talked to someone and  dozed off in the midst of the conversation. hehehe...but thats the only  occasion that happens...no more...errr...i think so...or i think it  happened 3 times? hahaha...sorry to those ppl, u know who u r ;)  Public apologies...SORRY  P/S: The soya bean near my house is very very nice...50cents...and if u buy  after 11am, its selling off at 3 for $1! Mummy got me Pooh Bear  bedsheets...hoohoohoo

      A long lost friend called me up ytd. Someone i've not spoken to  for the past few months, except for the SMSes which i dun even bother  to reply at times. Funny tho' despite the fact that we used to talk a lot at a  certain point of time...almost everyday  Anyway i can't help but feel irritated at a certain point of time during  the conversation. Maybe he called me at the wrong time? And NO, im not  having my PMS. I dunno, juz kinda cranky.  HIM: So u still go to Sentosa?  ME: Rarely...been bz  HIM: Thot u always go there? You are beach babe wat?  ME: *Is dat supposed to be a compliment or an insult?*  Going to the beach often doesn't mean that im a beach babe and  btw im too fat to be one...  Duh! Wats with these ppl...  Does going to beach often means that u r a beach babe/hunk?! I am not a beach babe dats for sure, way far...think more of a  BABE in the farm instead. And for god's sake, those guys that i chat wif  on the net, they always have the assumptions that im a tall, slim,tanned,  long-haired gal, typical beach babe kinda look juz cos i mentioned going  to the beach as a fav past time?...sorry to disappoint u guys  The true fact is i look like this! :    Dun u notice the fucking resemblance?  It doesnt help having big boobs cos the key word here is FAT...   Anyway there is no rule stating that fat ppl cant go to the beach. Who set that rule? Think its juz the typical mindset of locals...  And why is it when ppl see a fat 'ang-moh' wearing a bikini/going braless,  they dont seem to bother but when a local does that, they'll start to  criticise and makes comments?    Just a simple conclusion: Do not be stereotypical   So move aside beach babes...here comes Ms Piggy...

      Sigh...how many times do i have to tell u...if u dun love her, y carry on with the relationship? u r not being fair, tell her the truth, at least it will not hurt her that much rather than she got to know abt it later or see  you with another gal outside.  *It Must Have Been Love - Roxette, playing in the backgroud, yeah what a nice song at the rite time huh...smirk*  Even if u want to hide it from ur gf, then avoid going to places like  Town area for ur dates with 'dat gal', for goodness sake...u bloody  toad...very toot...obviously the chances of 'bumping' into familiar  faces are higher...still need me to teach you issit? *kokz*  U think u r being fair to ur gf? Im not siding wif her and im not in a position to do that either cos i dun even know her but no matter  how bad/good she is, u still have to tell her the truth! U are  practically wasting both ur time.  U tell me many times that u dun love her oso wats the point, im not ur gf. Haizzz...sometimes i dun understand guys oso...if u like her, go for it, if u dun, tell her abt it but if she's attached, then forget abt it.  i am not going to repeat myself, in case u ask me the same qns over  and over again...pls refer to this page for my comments.

      Ok ... its been long that i've not been in here to update. Quite a  few things happened...tiring   1) The motor show is a flop...waste my time and money   2) Its nice to see the no. of frds increasing in my friendster  3) Made an enemy...hurt 'someone'...i can only say sorry...i didnt mean  it...i dont blame u if u dun wanna tok to me anymore...its all my fault  4) Undead is the worst movie ive ever watched...almost wanted to walk-out halfway...bloody, fucking show...  5) Sourcing for jobs, i hate my current job, the air is filthy...i need new air   July is the month for crying...cry when u r happy, cry when u r sad... Sheesh i hate that...i hate to be seen crying...went to watch 'Windstruck' and i cried?! omg...im so emotional...hahaha...no tissues to wipe those tears  somemore...shucks...quick quick hide dat face...dun let anyone see  Someone asked me y do i go for chn guys even tho i know the fact that its hard for us to end up together cos we are of different race and  religion.  My answer for him? i cant answer him...*shrugz*...perhaps i was too lazy  to do that but after a few ponderings...hmmm...this is wat i think: Maybe i was being cursed...remembered telling a school frd one fine day, on our way back home "i have the feeling that my subsequent bfs will be chn" true enuff...no mly guys ever got my attention...im not being racist here but  sometimes i dun quite catch their mly jokes...lol ok ok...some of u guys might be thinking that im stupid/lame to even think of  this as a reason but hey i do try to accept a mly guy but i juz cant...love simply cant be forced and pls...if u have the thinking that chn are more loving/higher sex drive blah blah blah...that has nothg to do wif it either...that shld be based on  individuals...not race  I know its hard for us to be together in the end...u have ur beliefs, i have  mine...u have ur culture and i have mine too...i cant convert...u cant as well so in the end, break up...so y start it in the first place?  im juz stubborn...rebellious...despite knowing all these...  almost got married to one of my ex, a chn...but it didnt happened...dun wan  it to be without the blessings of both families...call me conservative if u  want U cant have the best of both worlds...so sacrifice ur love...it hurts deeply but i rather hurt 2 ppl than hurt more So let nature take its course is my answer but hey...u r turning 26 my dear!!  how long more u gonna be like this? ermmm till im ready...??   Sometimes i juz wish that im still that little small girl, no worries abt love,  work,money...i have toys to play wif    The stars are bright tonight A distance is between us And I will be OK The worst I've ever seen us  And still I have my weaknesses And still I have my strength And still I have my ugliness  But I, I I love you just the way you are I'll have you just the way you are I'll take you just the way you are Does anyone love the way they are ?   ~ STARS , Cranberries
