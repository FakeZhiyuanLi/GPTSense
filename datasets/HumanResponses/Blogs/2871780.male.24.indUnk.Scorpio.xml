       Big Day For My Cheryl   First of I'd like to publicly say how much I love you baby, i hate to coin a used phrase but you truly do complete me, you make me want to be a better person.  I can't wait to be your husband and be the father of your children.  So today is Cheryl's birthday, she is 24!  Happy Birthday baby!

I encourage anyone who happens to read this and wasnt planning on voting to vote.  How can you're voice be heard if you do not speak up.

       NHL Draft Predictions - Top 5   1. Alexander Ovechkin - Washington 2. Evgeni Malkin - Pittsburgh 3. Cam Barker - Chicago 4. Al Montoya - Pick Traded By Columbus 5. A.J. Thelen - Pheonix  The 5th pick is my shot in the dark..  I woudn't be surprised if they traded down, or even took the next goalie in the depth chart which is Marek Schwarz but the do need help on defense and Thelen is the best defenseman still available, and he's from NA which I think is a Wayne thing to do.    The first 4 are practically sure things, esp. 4 Columbus doesn't need a goalie but lots of teams do, I could see him being traded to a number of teams but more likely destinations include L.A, Minnesota or St. Louis  I don't think Montoya will last to 11 when L.A picks.  If Columbus doesn't trade I bet Montoya goes to the Rangers or Carolina.  Gonna be interesting nonetheless.

       Operation Northwoods   Im not sure if anyone has heard of this but I found it interesting. In 1962 the US Joint Chiefs devised a plan to conduct terrorism attacks in the US and make them look like they were done by Castro thus justifying a Cuban invasion. While surfing the net reading about this I came across this PDF file which is the actual RECENTLY UNCLASSIFIED document regarding the operation.   http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010430/doc1.pdf   theres a lot of babble here but it does get down to it on page 8   Quote:  Such a plan would enable a logical build-up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly unreleated events to camouflage the ultimate objective and create the necessary impression of Cuban rashness and irresponsibility on a large scale, directed at other countries as well as the United States.....The desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from the rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an internation image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.    page 10   Quote:  A series of well co-ordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give the genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.    it goes on and on after that through to the end with various schemes to cause people to think cuba is conducting terrorist attacks on american interests.   Lemnitzer was a psycho and this just helps justify it, if youve watched the movie thirteen days you can see how crazy the jc's were about going to war, and the bay of pigs, and then killing kennedy (if you believe the re-enactment as in the movie jfk, i do)...   anyways i just find this fascinating and thought id share.

       W Mitchell   I found this guy's story just unreal.  A Successful business man gets into a motorcycle accident burns 65% of his body, moves on in business and life and a recovers and learns to fly a plane among other incredible things, then gets into a plane crash which leaves him paralyzed, burned and paralyzed he starts another successful company, becomes the mayor of his city and becomes a congressman.  Just unreal.  The name of his new book is "It's not what happens to you...it's what you do about it"  just incredible, the strength this man has, I hope if something ever happens to me like this I have the strength to move on and still make something of my life instead of just giving up.

       Terrified   I went to my orientation tonight for the training ill be taking for london life / freedom 55.  the one thing that struck me is whent he speaker said "are you afraid because of what you are leaving behind or are you excited about the future" he wasnt looking for an answer but in mind mind i said both, but i guess in reality at this time i would have to say my thoughts are dominated by the first option.  i find myself not being able to sleep at night and having small panic attacks when i think about the possibility of failure.  i know i have the relationship and people skills to find and keep clients, i know i have the sales skills to close them and i know i have the deduction skills to make the right choices for them, but i cant help thinking about the what if's.  what if after i sign up first few friends and family that are interested in working with me the dont give me referals and i have nothing coming down the line.  what if all my other plans dont work out and im reduced to cold calling for clients.  well these are things i need to keep in mind yet not focus on.  im going to do my best to take baby steps and worry about the upcoming tests i need to get done and go from there.  here's to success!

       I Miss Hockey   I miss it already, its been what 2 weeks.  I hate having to flip through the tv channels to find something now that hockey isnt on.  Cheryl loves it but im snaky already.  Theres nothin on tv as captivating.  Nothing that you can say you dont know the outcome from day to day and you never know when you'll be watching when something BIG happens.  Thats what I love about sports in general.  The world Cup of Hockey cant come soon enough.

       Yes I'm A Salesman   it's been twice now that since I started with London Life / Freedom 55 that I've gotten comments about me trying to "sell" to people.  Both from people who i would say know me fairly well and have known me for a decent amount of time, one for my whole life as I remember it.  I'm not sure why all of a sudden I'm look at differently.  When talking about Valves, or Bearings I never got "you dont need to talk to him, he already has bearings!"   I hope this isnt a sign of things to come.  I finally have a job that I think Im going to love.  And I also honestly think I could help some of my friends secure a sound financial future.  So anyways maybe i'm feeling sorry for myself but I hope that my friends realize if I talk to them about my business I do it because I think i can help them.

       "Just taking it one day at a time and Lord willing I'll come out with the W"   Ahhhh the age old rhetoric of the professional athlete.  Anyone who know me knows I do a rather stunning impression of a hockey players mid-period interview, being sure to add in as many cliches as humanly possible before I scurry into the locker room to dump the same crap once again on my teammates as a rally cry for another goal.  "Just gotta give it 110% out there" "We're not doing a good job taking away time and space" - ahh the good ole time and space (homage to Pierre McGuire) "We gotta respect his abilities out there" "I'm tryin to play hard in the corners"  And of course the all time favs  "Just have to take it one game at a time"  and  "Hopefully we'll come out with a "W" tonight"  Now for years and years I thought this crap was just...well...crap.  Until recently when I found myself in my London Life / Freedom 55 Training course.  The nature of this course was that in the first 2 week we are preparing and studying to write our Mutual Funds exam.  The balance of the course is dedicated to the LLQP (Life License Qualification Program)  I not only was told to put the LLQP out of mind completely for now, but found myself completely focused and able to actually do so...making the statement "One day at a time" completely apply.  I never thought when I heard an athlete say this that they were actually able to do this...to not think about the next game at all until the first game is finished.  But now that I have written my IFIC (Mutual Funds Exam) I find myself not only relieved, but not thinking about it at all, I have moved on to thinking about my preparation for the LLQP.  I find this new skill I have acquired actually quite invigorating and exciting, adding an aspect of complete and utter focus on one task....something most of you would know I typically am not able to do.  So in an attempt at living vicariously the life of a professional athlete....here's to  "Taking it one day at a time and hopefully coming out with the "W"

       US 'Friendly Fire' Pilot Tells Lawyer to Appeal Dereliciton of Duty Verdict   Someone need to remind this son of a bitch that he FUCKING KILLED CANADIAN SOLDIERS. This man has gotten off light in the eyes of the rest of the world yet is going to appeal his bullshit charge. This asshole has no remorse and no feeling of guilt for the crimes he has committed and I am not going to be the first to say why. This is the overall attitude that the citizens of the United States, in general (I DO NOT MEAN EVERYONE!! - so save your not me rebuttals), have towards the rest of the world. And then they fucking wonder why people are flying airplanes into buildings and shit??? Americans care about Americans, and even sometimes don't care about their OWN countrymen. I personally and completely sick of this bullshit, someone needs to remind this man that he is a MURDERER and MURDERERS GO TO FUCKING JAIL.   /end rant

       THINK YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY - Which I was until now.   Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and face mask in the middle of the forest.   A post-mortem test revealed that the man died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.   It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the man went diving off the coast, some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, had called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and emptied at the site of the forest fire.   You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next, he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air and then airborne into smoke heaven.   Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.   ____________Still think you're having a bad day?  A man was working on his motorcycle on the patio, his wife nearby in the kitchen. While sitting on the bike and racing the engine, the motorcycle accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged along as it burst through the glass patio doors.   His wife, hearing the crash, ran in the room to find her husband cut and bleeding, the motorcycle, and the shattered patio door. She called for an ambulance and, because the house sat on a fairly large hill, went down the several flights of stairs to meet the paramedics and escort them to her husband.   While the attendants were loading her husband, the wife managed to right the motorcycle and push it outside. She also quickly blotted up the spilled gasoline with some paper towels and tossed them into the toilet.   After being treated and released, the man returned home, looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He went into the bathroom and consoled himself with a cigarette while attending to his business. About to stand, he flipped the butt between his legs. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. Finding him lying on the bathroom floor with his trousers blown away and burns on his buttocks, legs and groin, she once again phoned for an ambulance.  The same paramedic crew was dispatched. As the paramedics carried the man down the stairs to the ambulance they asked the wife how he had come to burn himself. She told them. They started laughing so hard, one slipped, tipping the stretcher and dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs, breaking his arm.   ______________ Still having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse...  The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon  Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the most expensively saved animals were being released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer whale ate them both.   ____________________ Still think you are having a bad day?  A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically, almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a handy plank of wood, breaking his arm in two places. Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his Walkman.   _________________ STILL think you're having a bad day?  Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn, Germany. Suddenly, all two thousand pigs broke loose and escaped through a broken fence, stampeding madly.  The two hopeless protesters were trampled to death.   _________________ What?! STILL having a bad day??  Iraqi terrorist Khay Rahnajet didn't pay enough postage on a letter bomb. It came back with "return to sender" stamped on it. Forgetting it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits. There now, feeling better?

       $5,672   Apparently this is all we are worth to the American Military.  To have our lives held in such dis-regard because the United States is soo vain they are willing to protect criminals within their own military so they dont "loose face"  This pilot killed Canadian soldiers and recieved a FINE!  And even worse than that, even though he was removed as a pilot from the Air Force he was offered a pilots position in I believe the Coast Guard or some other military wing.  This is brutal.

       Just Tired   Because ive been staying up sooo late the last few or three weeks I find myself exhausted now that I have to get up at 7 am every morning again, and since im still not falling asleep till about 1 or 2 am, needless to say I'm pretty tired right now.  School is going well, the people I sit with are cool.  There's an older woman in her late 30's who is retarded though, not only does she keep he cell phone on and got a call today right in the middle of class (which is completely disrespectful) she was late coming back from a break and then asked a stupid question about something we have just went over.  I was about to tell her "If you were ON TIME you would know that!"  It drove me nuts.  They are also doing the practice tests for each section BEFORE we review the section, which i find retarded cause it not really helping us to test us before we learn, isnt the idea to test us after we learn?
