      So it has been an interesting couple of days.  On Wednesday I experienced my first tornado warning.  I thought that something about my Who CD sounded funny, then I realized it was coming from outside.  It was a tornado siren.  I told my Dad throughout the whole drive out from Oregon that I was really fascinated by tornadoes and that I couldn't wait to experience (from a reasonable distance) the mighty winds that would ensue.  Then of course when there was a "tornado watch" in my county I started to change my tune.  Of course nothing happened, apparently there were two "funnel clouds" spotted, which are early tornadoes before they touch down on the ground!  Kelley arrived Thursday morning so you can understand why I've been bad about blogging.  It's been a nice couple of days.  She took me clothes shopping at the mall yesterday.  I don't know how I would have done any of that without her.  We had hella huge margaritas!!  Anywho, she sat through a couple of thunderstorm, and even flash flood warnings the last couple of days as well.  A sign of things to come perhaps?  How does anyone get anything done around here what with the constant threat of bad weather?  I finally got my basic cable hooked up on Friday which means I finally got to see the olympics.  I've been glued to the tube!  Too bad our friggin mens basketball team can't their shit together.  Sean, I hope you had your $$ on Michael Phelps.  Do you know that trampoline is an olympic sport?  You get ten jumps to impress the judges with flips and twirls and what nots.  Not too much else to report really.  I start my "new grad student orientation" on Monday, the same day that Kelley goes home.  This means I have to start getting up before 11:00, drag.  Thanks a whole heaping bunch to Sleeve for sending me some info on the Bloomington scene.  He was back here in the early nineties I reccon.  He's convincing me that there just might be an interesting art scene in Bloomington...I remain hopefull, but sorta skeptical.  Good News for People who love bad news (Modest Mouse) went platinum recently.  Good for Isacc and the boys.  I heard "float on" at the mall yesterday.  Made me laugh.  solid.

      I miss the band.  I wanted to say a couple of things in regards to pellet gun.  I still don't know if it's supposed to be one word or two!  Kelani was nice enough to put a link to my blog on her blog yesterday.  She made a pgun reference, so I wanted to touch on a few things.  Thank's to Ed for his kind words, and thanks to Mr. f'n Randomn for putting a link to my blog on his blog (I made it in the locals section no less!)  It's been nice to get this attention.  We did some recording at Revolver studios in early July.  These are some buddies of ours who have just opened a studio up recently.  One of them may or may not like to go by the name "fartface" (see members)  Anywho, we gave out some rough mixes of two of the songs "Two Dead Cats," and "Vulgarians," at our show at the Wow hall.  We recorded a total of 14 tracks (I think), most of which I haven't heard since the sessions themselves.  I was really happy with the way the band came together to do this.  From what I remember anyway these are some great representations of what we've done the past 3 or so years.   Point: I'll try and keep you posted on the goings on of the mixing process.  I'm not sure where everything stands right now.  Sean?  But we hope to get it finished up sooner rather than later.  There's also been talk of Brian the Mumford releasing the record on his label.  Gotta run, there closing the library.  I'll finally have internet at my house on Thurs. oh and did I mention my lovely lady will be visiting on that day also?  Well consider it mentioned.

      So much to blog about. Not so much about me really as my routine has been getting kind of bland. I've been sleeping too much. Don't get me wrong it's been nice, but the productivety has been down (no loafing!). I'd like to take a minute to discuss the breakup of Phish. NO wait, don't stop reading!! At the risk of sounding profoundly lame, I have to say that I can't help but feel saddened that their career as a band has come to an end. As a lover of improvised music I really look at these guys as being some of the best, in the rock genre that is. Ya, ok call me a hippie.  And as a drummer Jon Fishman (phish drummer) has probably been my single biggest influence thus far in my career. As a matter of fact, I feel that a big reason why I chose music was due to phish, and Jon Fishman. I remember listening to A Live One, which was a live album that was put out in probably 94 or 95. I was 16/17 and was just floored by the sounds. I couldn't believe that anyone could sound so good.  The phish shows at the gorge in WA came to be an annual get away for my freinds and I. I'm sad that these shows have come to an end. But hey there's always Oz fest!   CHANGING GEARS      I   went out on the town on Friday. I finally decided to get off the couch. I saw the Walkmen play at a place here in town called The 2nd Story. One thing I immediately noticed upon getting there is it's resemblance to Dante's in Portland. Very similar. The other thing I noticed was that you could smoke inside the 2nd story. The smoke was thick! I was rubbing my eyes the entire time I was there.   I got there in time to see one opening act. They were called the Vegetables. Let me just say that I did not enjoy the Vegetables. Oh man. The front reminded me a little bit of Nick Lavine, and that's not a diss on Nick. Nick's songs are a lot better. This guy in the Vegetables used so much vibrato when he sang that I had to wonder if he was trying to be funny about it. No such luck. The songs were all up tempo-swingy-show tune sounding numbers. oooooh man.  I was happy when they were done.  The Walkmen fucking rocked. Maybe I was happy to hear someone who weren't the Vegetables. But these guys were really good. They've recieved a couple of comparisons to 'the Strokes' (on a side note I hope to mention the aforementioned band anymore). The front man in the Walkmen sounded like a cross between Julian Casablancas (with less atitude I might add) and Bob Dylan. You'd just have to hear it. Anyway, very good stuff.  Kelley's coming on Thursday! She'll be here through the weekend. We might go up to South Bend and visit Dave Snyder and Tami...we'll see what happens.  I went to take back some bottles at my local Kroger's store last night and when I asked the guy where the bottle return was he looked at me like I was from Mars. I guess they don't do that here. Oh and another thing,  YOU CAN'T BUY ALCOHOL ON SUNDAYS!!!!!      BLOOD RED.      As I bring this to a close I just have to say, rock on Kelani, my glitter sistah, you're one of the only woman ever to apply makeup to my face... or was that Tina?

      Naw, i jokes. but what the hell are you doing in indiana anyways? you should be here in oregon with your little sister, practicing way too much for your own good and taking me out to bars with you and your crazy friends who i love to death. enough of that. so last night the fam went out to our usual friday night dinner, and mom got wasted off 1 margarita, and i got pretty damn tipsy off some sort of drink, and dad...well, dad had 2 beers and drove us home. but i think you would have found it entertaining, to say the least. i don't usually drink with the rents, that's still a little too weird for me, even though i am approaching year 22, but after my 40 hour work week (first one in a month) and the general argument with mom telling me i hurt her feelings through my tone of voice in the car ride to dinner, a drink was in order. just to keep you up to date and all...today was my first day to actually sleep in in a week and a half, and i'll be off to work at the gap (horrors) from 5-9, then will have my first day off tomorrow. watched Gothika with halle berry last night, decent flick but a little campy and relied too much on sudden movements of scary people to try and make me pee my pants. nevertheless, i ran up the stairs at the end of the night. when deciding whether to watch that choice film or another thriller, a blockbuster employee tried to chat me up and see if i needed "any help." this translates to: you are a girl in a short skirt. let me come talk to you. either way, i did the usual and embarassed myself by having the following conversation: BB employee: so, do you need any help? Me: well, i'm trying to decide between gothika and in the cut (both not so great films, eh), what would you do? BB: well, they're both pretty good (what a poor salesman), i would have to flip a coin Me: (this is where i get into bad territory) well, in the cut has mark ruffalo in it, and i should probably try to curb my obsession with him a little (STOP, STOP), seeing as how I've watched '13 Going on 30' three times now. (i realize my misstep, and slowly retreat, head hanging in shame, to the checkout counter, meekly saying, 'well, nice shirt and all' to cover up my shame, as if poking fun at the employee's lime green polo shirt will bring me a little redemption)  and that was megan's friday night with mom, dad, and the blockbuster employee. you're missing a lot, i tell you. i miss you, B. a lot. can't wait til thanksgiving m  "it's sooo hot! milk was a bad choice"-ron burgandy aka will ferrel

      So blogging everyday is hard. I have to make it to the post office in less than an hour also so this may be brief. hmmmmm...  -I got my practice room keys!!!!! For those of you who don't know, this was something I didn't think I would be able to do until school starts, which was bumming me out. Now I can actually do something with myself besides drinking alone.  -Modest mouse is playing tonight in Louisville, KY, or as I like to call it Louuuvle. First I was going to go, then I wasn't, then I was...you see. But Ma Gardiner sent me a magazine in the mail that had them on the cover. I read it. Then I wanted to go to the show. See, that's how these things work. Unfortunately it was sold out at that point.  But let me just take this opportunity to say that I am in love with Jeremiah Green. Favorite rock drummer. If I was a woman...  -I picked up the new Sonic Youth DVD yesterday entitled "Corporate Ghost." A very Thurston title. It's enjoyable but kind of dissapointing. Every SY video ever made is on this thing. There are a lot of them. Kelley how is my grammer? Anyway, I was hoping for more behind the scenes footage of Thurston and Kurt Cobain drinking Heinekens by the railroad tracks. But I guess "The Year Punk Broke" will have to do. For anyone who hasn't seen the aforementioned movie, I recommend it.  Welcome to my new members. Were you trying to be sneaky Poinbexter? OOOOH who-ever could you be?????  Going to see The Walkmen tonight (a band). Never heard them, taking a chance. First night out on the town. Woohoooo!  more later.  Hey Becky, I mean Poinbexter, check out my coment below.  You, You're a Hoosier!

      These are some excerpts from a pamphlet I found at the Visitors center:  -There was a contactor named "Hoosier" on the Louisville and Portland Canal who always preferred to hire men from Indiana because they were good workers.  They were called Hoosier's men and later simply Hoosiers.   -James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier poet, mantained that the word came from the pugnacious habits of Indiana's settlers.  When fighting, they bit off the ears of their opponents.  A settler coming into a tavern the morning after a fight, seeing an ear on the floor, would say "whose ear?"  and this led to "Hoosier."   There are a few other theories, but these are my favorite and thus more likely to be true.  Been listening to Yo La Tengo today.  The heart beats as one, what an f'n good album.

       friggin hot.    holly hell.    fun with colors...     That's quite enough of that.  I wish i could figure out how to upload pictures on to this thing.  I'd show you guys pix of the apartment.  I don't think I have the right program...which brings me to another point:  I won't get any internet at the apt. until Thursday the 19th.  hmmm.  And another thing, if you plug your t.v. in to the wall here you get three f'n channels: WB, the opb affiliate, and the Christian network.   Bloomington cable comunists!!     They want you to pay an extra $12 a month to get the basic channels, what's that all about. I tried to go for a walk last night, needed to get out of the apt.  I'm getting a little stir crazy.  My Mom keeps telling me to go out and meet people...she should know me better than that.  Anyway, there isn't really anything exciting to see around my house except gas stations and office buildings, so the walk didn't last very long.  I haven't been able to talk to Kelley much these past few days, what with the OFAM going on in Eugene, she's working like 14 hour days or some shit hooooooweeeee, Mama's gonna be bringing home the tofu.  You Rasheed Wallace fans should check out:   urlLink www.geocities.com/colosseum/loge/7346/   Whoa, did I just link something!  Funny stuff about Rasheed...  Lastly, one of things that's keeping me going right now is a free DVD I got in the mail.  The people at the message board over at builttospill.com offered a trade of a BTS DVD of them playing in Atlanta in 2001.  All I had to do was drop an envelope in the mail with a blank DVD in it (cost maybe $2) and a week later I've got a built to spill show to watch.  Makes me nostalgic.  Makes me homesick, but in a good way?  You guys should call me.  I'm out.

      Why did it take me so long to do this?  Is it because I never leave my house?  No I have a computer there.  Is it because I can't get the drum sticks out of my hands...probably.  You are viewing "the B."  I plan on not only blogging on my findings in Bloomington, IN.  But also commenting on what transpires back home in Eugene, OR... like Max's shutting down, WTF?!  I've been seeing info about the Eugene Celebration coming up and I already feel nostalgic.  I had the opportunity to play the past two years and wish I could somehow beam myself to Eugene for the festivities this year.  If you're reading this you probably already know me.  You know I don't drink a lot.  You know that I'm pretty responsible= not hip.  And you know I'm a percussionist entering a doctoral program at Indiana University.  I got here pretty early so that I might check out the scene, get settled, etc.  This is hard when you don't have an f'n phone book.  1.thing that scares me about Bloomington: people in cars approach stop lights and signs REALLY fast!  I never think that they're stopping.  2. Dave Snyder a.k.a. "the D" is in Chicago right now.  I hope to try and hook it up w/ him  3. This is the first post so I'm sure I'll get more entertaining as I get in to a rhythm (ha).  I miss you guys already.
