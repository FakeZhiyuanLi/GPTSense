       today i coded almost 500 lines, despite sore throat and major headache, haven't sleep since monday (well, i do sleep but maybe it can be called a nap because i only sleep about 3 hours/day) and i really need to clean my apt. it is a bloody mess. But this whole deal with coding all day and all night, makes me wonder. does coding make my life better? does it makes me a better person? implication of this way of coding means lack of sleep, high caffeine intake and major clotting of arteries by cigarettes. i mean, you can't go through all night by going cold turkey.  on second thought, i should not worry about it. coding makes me feel good about myself. i feel that i've accomplished something. feel that one last bug is one giant step towards a greater future. or maybe because for the past two years, i hardly code? i mean, code as in coding in my free time, almost 24 hours a day? maybe there would be a time to stop, but for now, i'm just happy to code my way through life, as if nothing else matters.

       For those of you looking forward to fridays, here it is coming your way! :) i'm still on the middle of coding, btw, so can't be bothered to sleep and plan ahead for the night :) if i might say, this has been an interesting week, and i look forward into its culmination towards the greater good -- PARTY! :) i don't know about you, but i'm excited! kinda like that kid when his mother took him to the candy store grand opening -- wonder how that feel , but none can compare to this... seperation anxiety from the past week into the next one, wrapped up into a nice, thin layer of chocolate called booze, cigarettes, coffee, girls, sex, E, TRANCE :) bring it on!

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  I missed my old camera. i really do. dulu kalo kemana2 pasti gue bawa kamera, waktu uni. foto sana sini, nyobain efek ini itu. have i told you that kamera gue umurnya the same as me ? well, maybe a day older. my dad bought it the day before i was born, don't know whether he bought it so he can take pictures when i emerged into the seemingly cold, dark and unmerciful world which i have been living in for the past 24 years, or biar kameranya bisa di pass on to me years later. but anyways, i just love to take pictures.  kamera gue, pentax mx manual, 35 mm SLR, standard 50mm lens, medium wide 28mm lens, 3 uv filter and a motor drive. not exactly a photographer's dossier, but it does the job. unfortunately the motor drive's now fucked, and the frame counter on the head unit has seized. all because my girlfriend at that time (we've broken up since then) trashed it because she's so damn angry with me :P i wish i don't love her that much at that time so i could smack her for trashing my camera, but i just couldn't do it. i love my cameras above all else, but i can't get myself to stop her, i just stood there. :(  sebenernya gue ggak gitu bisa moto inanimate objects, never really look good soalnya (apa skill nya aja gak ada?) tapi i always fond of modelling, alias foto orang :) rasanya puas banget kalo foto yg gue ambil dibilang bagus, apalagi dipajang orang :) it really gives me a sense of confidence buat terus motret. and then comes nude photography. i found that some shoots are so well-defined and artistic, making it more like an artistic painting rather that photographs. if i got to choose where in the world could i shoot, it would be new york city , and if i could have shooting session with someone, it would be with :)

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  so you meet this guy or girl, and after a few dates, you can both call yourselves girlfriend/boyfriend. all seems sweet and colorful at the very beginning, but then after spending some quality time, and so on and so forth, it would then hits you. gue sebenernya sayang ggak sih ama ni orang? gue bisa ggak sih spending yet another minute with this girl/guy? let alone the rest of my life (if you're looking for a serious relationship). emang sih waktu bisa bikin semuanya berubah. people change, situation change, and, matter than most, feelings change.  if you're a seasoned lover, to be able to extract romance from relationship is not as easy as buying a new tie for your boyfriend or a new gucci shoes for your girlfriend. kalo diliat dari segi psikologisnya, romance cuman bakal ada kalo the feeling is mutual. most importantly, sama sama sayang dan mau kompromi. love, ato cinta, butuh compromise. seandainya kita nggak bisa kompromi, ato mau perhatiin orang yang sayang ama kita, you can forget about taking relationship to the next level. semuanya kalo menurut gue cuma tentang hal hal kecil. love is all about small things.

       I just looking at a newspaper a few days ago when I was at the office, and I just realise that, the more successful an athlete is, the more prone he or she is to injuries. What's the point of having a body which is so ripped, yet so fragile like porcelain? I guess it is an occupational hazard. Tore ligament, pulled hamstring, fractured knee -- and your career depend on those shoulders that could never heal, elbows which always swollen in the morning, and a migrane that seems would last a lifetime.  Does this sounds like living? Albeit a short one, it is. Generally an athlete will enter a professional career at 20 years old, and it will finish a year or two past their 40th birthday. While us mere mortals still struggling to pay our mortgages, them athletes would retire, often in injury-riddled body, but more often, they retire with glory, just as they always wanted to be remembered.

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  Is it disturbing kalo kehidupan kita basically just for the coming weekend? We went through the hell of a week just to live on the weekend, and died on post-trip on saturday morning. Mungkin kalo dipikir2, on a saturday morning we should wake up at 9 am, have your coffee and newspaper while watching video hits on telly. But then again, that is for the faint-hearted. For some of us, it means coming up out of a club on 7 am, shivering on a cold winter morning, can barely walk normally, but yet we have smiles on our faces.  As weekend went past us, and we continue with our daily activities, the memories of the previous weekend would still linger in our minds. The beauty of it, the euphoric feeling, the happiness, kayaknya emang cuma satu2nya yg bikin kita gak peduli ama semua problem hidup. Kedengerannya sih kayaknya "The Great Escape". untuk sebagian orang ini sama halnya ama lari dari realita. But by all means, i beg to differ. These people do have life. Dan mereka sama sekali nggak mencoba untuk lari dari kenyataan hidup mereka. To rave, to party, to let it all loose, it is just a freedom of expression that has been bound for the past 5 days of their life, waiting to get out, and tentu saja ggak ada yang salah ama freedom of expression kan?

       Third and Final Part, The conclusion. This is more dark and not as cheerful as the first two parts. I still don’t think that this would end here, more stories are coming in the near future, so until then…  DISCLAIMER: This story was based on actual event. The name of the character was changed to avoid legal terms and/or privacy issues. On some characters, I just cbf and write the actual name anyway. Any similarities with any actual person, either living or dead, are purely coincidental. Or blatant rip-off.  Her name was Danielle.  Danielle was great. She's funky, knows almost anything that I liked, and for that first time. I felt something different. We spend great days together, and she still remembers me until today. But the funny thing was this conversation we had, the night before my flight to Melbourne.  "Gerry.."  "Yeah?...."  "Do you remember Jenniffer?"  "Jennifer Lockridge?"  "Yeah."  "Yes I do, but what about her?". Funny that she brought this up, I think. I told Danielle about Jennifer before, but she never brought stories about past crush or love to the surface, yet.  "She's taking my Anthropology class on Wednesday. We kind of.. hook up and she knows we've been seeing each other.."  "Oh?" I started to wonder where this would lead off to.  "Yeah, and we had a couple cup of coffee, and she confessed about something.. something about you and her back in high school.."  Shit. I thought. See, to Danielle, I am this cool, open-minded guy, a trade i've developed over the years, but to Jennifer, I was a geek (Well, I'm still a geek NOW, for that matter!). If she tells Danielle anything about who I was in high school, I can kiss my last night with Danielle goodbye. Without any sex. I better come up with something quick, goddamnit.  "Well, I don't think you should believe.." I didn't have a chance to finish my sentence, she stopped me halfway through.  "Wait.. Gerry.. I want to tell you something that she tells me...about her feelings for you".  By now my anxiety has turned to curiousity. Her feelings? I give her this puzzled look on my face.  "Her Feelings?" I said curiously.  "She told me.." she stopped. "She told me that, when you both still in high school, she actually grown to like you, and she's waiting for you to finally asked her out, but you never did, and on the afterparty after your graduation, she wants to tell you how she feel, but her friend told her not to. So she didn't..."  I stared at her in disbelief. For a moment there I couldn't say a word. If it wasn't for Richard's advice back when i've started the whole game, I would've started to stutter. But thank God, I didn't.  "Is that so? You're not pulling my leg here, are you?"  "No, I am not. She actually liked you. She thought you are a sweet guy, but you didn't make a move.."  Danielle's words are loud and clear. The song "Trash" by Suede is playing on the deck, and there is a heavy traffic up ahead. It is saturday night, and people are getting out. It is noisy, but her voice is crystal clear. And suddenly, I thought about Jennifer again, unconciously.  "She liked me... I never thought that she would feel the same way as.."  For a moment there, I forgot that Danielle was there. And I know that my words there would make her upset, but it was too late. Before I can say anything, she said the dreaded line.  "Gerry.. Take me home.." She said calmly.  And the night was over for us. I said sorry, and I didn't mean it. But she's already hurt. Even though it was years ago, and of course Jennifer is dating someone now, but how you feel towards a high school crush, can make a girl envy her is she really liked you. I never thought Danielle would react that way. In a way I don't regret that I lost Danielle like this. I found it that I had it in me all along. I'm just not realising it. I felt sorry for Danielle, so I paged her to say goodbye,and wish her luck, and ask her if I can still catch up with her if I ever be in Bandung again.  I smiled, and I'm looking forward to leave for Melbourne. I left no strings attached, and I think, this is a good start for a better life. I sung to my favourite track "Beachball" by Nalin & Kane, as I went home, Thinking what would be the first thing i do as soon as i've arrived in Melbourne.  Bandung Train Station, 12.30, Sunday  I finished my Cigarette. My mom and dad would take me up until Soekarno-Hatta Airport, Jakarta. My flight will leave on 8.50 tonight. I called Richard and said a couple of words about what happened last night, and he as always, told me to forget it and move on. I felt a bit sad, leaving all i've known behind, but the imagination of a whole new experience, makes me forget about it in a matter of minutes.  "The train leaves in five dear," my mom said. "Why? no girls to set you off this time?.." She smiled.  I smiled back. My mom knows that for the past 3 months the girls that have been calling me are different each time the phone rings. She knows I’m into the game, but she told me not to screw with their hearts, and be careful with what I’m doing. I was lucky to have a mother who is so understanding and open-minded.  "The girls are at Uni mom, they have something better to do besides setting me off." I replied.  "Well, those girls doesn't know what they're missing right now...." She stand up and started to walk to the platform.  "Your mom's right, Son. It is not always good not to leave something behind, sometimes, you need to be able to tell to your heart, that someone is remembering good things about you, even when you weren't there anymore".  My Dad said. Tapped me on the shoulder, and he follows my mom to the platform.  I thought to myself, how true that is. It would be nice to have someone like.... Then I stopped. I can't remember anything about Jennifer. Instead, I thought about Danielle. I remember how I hurt her, and suddenly, I wanted to see her again. I began to feel this stirring sensation in my stomach that I've never felt before. Richard never give me anything on this. That was weird, I thought. I started to missed her. I picked up my bags, and as I started walking toward the platform, I heard her voice.  "..Gerry.."  “… Danny?..”  Danielle was there. I wanted her to be here, and there she is. I smiled, and she ran towards me, giving me a big hug.  "I thought that.."  "Sssh.."  She kissed me. Weird. She never kissed me this way before. It was soft, as if she puts all her emotion into it.  "Look, I am sorry about the words I said last night.."  ".. Gerry.."  "..And I know I am being insensitive and all.."  "..Listen, Gerry..."  ".... I am just suprised that She.."  "..Would you just shut up and let me say something??" She said impatiently.  I stopped, and waited. She looked sad, but there's this thing in her eyes that i've never seen before.  "I fall in love with you, and no matter what you feel about Jennifer, it doesn't matter to me because I love you, and if you leave today, I wanted to tell you how I feel, because I don't want you to be just another guy who broke my heart." She said, looking me in the eyes.  And that stirring in my stomach, spun a little bit more faster now. And suddenly, that day become one of those perfect day.  I told mom and dad to go ahead without me, and said to them I will take the next train two hours later. Danielle and I checked into a hotel, and settled our unfinished business. I left Bandung two hours later, decided to give this long-distance relationship a try.  We broke up in June, 1999.

       This is the second part of “A day..” I must say things are really getting up to scratch. :) We'll find out what happened with me & Jeniffer.  DISCLAIMER: This story was based on actual event. The name of the character was changed to avoid legal terms and/or privacy issues. On some characters, I just cbf and write the actual name anyway. Any similarities with any actual person, either living or dead, are purely coincidental. Or blatant rip-off.  Then I make that decision. It was quick, it requires no thinking. What the heck, I thought at that time, nobody knows me anyway, and if its come to humiliation, to hide yourself its quite easy, since you don't go out much.  "I'm In" I said firmly.  "Good." "Mrs. Eggert? a Bowl of prawn crackers, and a bottle of iced tea please?"  "Coming right up, Richard" She smiles  "Thanks" Richard puts out his cigarette.  "Listen. Learn to keep your cool about this. I will do my best to keep your competitors at bay, spread a rumor and stuff. All you got to do is concentrate on the task at hand. got it?"  "Fair Enough...what's next?"  "Great. Secondly, talk to her, for Christ's sake, haven't you learn anything in junior high?"  "well, there's this one girl.."  "One? you go to junior high for 3 years and you dated only one girl? this is going to be a lot of work."  I shook my head. What do you expect? A geek doesn't exactly sells out like our casanova here, I thought.  "OK, not to worry, Pointers. I'll put this into something you can easily comprehend. Go up to her, and ask her for that notes on world history from Mr. Nunuh's class last Thursday. Tell her you didn't quite catch up, and you need to borrow that notes for the report we supposed to submit next Thursday."  Mr. Nunuh was a fast writer. I think he can write 80wpm on a blackboard. Being a teacher for 14 years can grant you superhuman ability.  "But I already done that on Monday" I always liked world history.  "Doesn't matter. you only need the notes so you have the reason to RETURN it later, personally, at her house, and giving you the chance, to score a date..."  "Clever", I grinned.  "Of course. It is classic, but it still works."  Mrs. Eggert brought Richard's orders on our table "there you go, boys, enjoy"  "thanks a lot" Richard smiles.  "just be confident, and be cool if a fucked-up situation comes up, remember not to try to be akward, and stutters, like u did with that girl we saw the other day."  A group of girls, seniors, took me to this girl, who also a senior. they said that she want to introduce herself to me. I was nervous, so I stuttered when I spoke to her, and that blew away my chance. I can't even remember her name until today, because I forgot. Speaking of social-interaction trauma-related stress.  "Look man, if you're going to make your move, now is the best time. Finish your marlboro, go and find her, remember what I told you.." Richard said seriously.  "Thanks man. I owe you one"  "anything for the sake of brotherhood, matey" Richard smiles.  I put out my marlboro and finished my coke.  "Mrs. Eggert?, can you put it on my tab? And can you put Richard's one here on me as well?"  "Sure thing. remember that yours are due on friday though" Mrs. Eggert shouts from the back.  "I will.." I shouted back.  "Oh, Gerry, since you're putting mine on your tab today, how about clearing my past six?"  "Dont push your luck, mate.."  "No harm done in trying.." Richard continues with his crackers.  I left the canteen and tried to find her. She was on the west corridor, walking down to courtyard. I better catch her now, I thought. So I run, and tap her on her shoulder. This is it.  "Hi Jennifer.."  "Hi Gerry, how are you?.."  And so, the journey begins....  to cut the story short, Richard and I become good friends, but jennifer and I never really hit it off, for some reason, I just couldn't gather enough courage to ask her out, of course we talk and had a few drinks, but for a date? Richard even gets angry at me and won't spoke to me for a week. It kinda suck, since he is my friend, so I apologize to him and cleared out his entire tab. He was happy, and we moved on.  Come along the graduation day. I've dated a few girls, and the tools of the trade was in my possession at last. Richard was happy with my progress, and he cleared out my entire tabs. We went to afterparty, of course tears flows, Richard was the one that hugged me the first time, we were so wasted, not to mention everyone else. I wanted to see Jennifer and tell her how I feel, but Richard said that I should forget about it, and move on. I am coming to Australia in about 3 months, and the last thing I need, is a string attached with a high school crush. So I didn't and I just enjoyed the moment. Richard went to Jakarta to study. As for myself, I was becoming one of the players. I got nothing to lose, so I spend my days working at a McDonalds, hooking up with girls, and taking language classes. While everyone is busy with their Uni, I was doing nothing and nothing important came up, until I met this girl.  [To be Continued...]

       I decided to write a no-nonsense story today. I’ll keep it simple and funny (although for some reason, people would find it to be otherwise: P)  DISCLAIMER: This story was based on actual event. The name of the character was changed to avoid legal terms and/or privacy issues. On some characters, I just cbf and write the actual name anyway. Any similarities with any actual person, either living or dead, are purely coincidental. Or blatant rip-off.  When I was in senior high, I have a crush on this girl, she's about 160, slim and as most girls in the first year of high school, is a cutie. So we're in this language class, (if I’m not mistaken). Mr. Rochana, our teacher, as we all know, teaches at the rate that gives the impression of our wall clock going backwards.  Anyway, I was bored, so I decided to write a list of games that I would like to buy in the next few days. Being a geek that I am in the first year of high school, you couldn't care about anything else beside to get home early and start re-doing that maze puzzle in King's Quest V. Suddenly, this guy Richard, who sit 2 desks up whispers something to me.  "Gerry..."  "What's up?"  "I have something to tell you..."  "Enlighten me, and be double quick, cause I really need to use a distraction..."  "See that girl?"  He nods his head towards a girl sitting in the same row as mine. This is the cutie I mentioned earlier.  "What about her?" I said.  He said "She's looking at you about 5 times in the last couple of minutes...”  "Well, maybe it's you that looking at her about 5 times in the last couple of minutes... How do you know these things?" I said, sarcastically.  "No... You fuckface, I’m telling the truth... just look...” He said.  And then I turn my head to look at her.  I waited a couple of minutes, don't know what to expect, but finally, she glanced at me, but maybe that's because a girl sitting behind her wants to borrow her pen, and when she want to turn around, our eyes was like, met :) - then I smiled at her.  She smiled back. Instead of this weird-looking face most girls gave when I tried to look at them, she smiled.  "HOLY SHIT DUDE..." Richard said.  "You never ceased to amaze me. What are the odds?" I replied.  See this guy, Richard, is known to pull pranks on people. Joked a lot, never take things seriously, and have the potential to be a good lawyer because he can make things believable, by the way he explain things. But none of these superb abilities can earn him even a single date with a girl. Probably because he's only 160cm high. He drives a 4x4, which makes him almost disappears behind the wheel and makes people think that some phantom-driver took his 4x4 for a ride. One time, he tricked a transfer student who can't speak fluent Sundanese to adopt a nickname which in Batak language means male genitalia. Really, he is that good.  "How do you know this is positive...?” I said...  "Let’s go to the canteen and discuss this in an appropriate manner."  "Lead the way, my friend...”  "Sir?" Richard shouted to Mr. Rochana.  "Yes?"  "Can we both be excused? My mom just paged me, I think it is important"  "What about him?"  Mr. Rochana points his chalk at me. I need to come up with something fast. I cursed Richard in my mind because we didn't even discuss the reason to leave first. I'll smack him after this.  "I need to um, uh, take my medicine, sir, uh, see I’m having this condition which requires me to take some pills every 4 hours, to keep me from blacking out, um, yeah, so it is imperative that I am excused..."  Mr Rohana just stares at me, silently. Oh, and the rest of the class as well. Shit, I thought. Richard can barely keep himself from laughing his ass off.  "Shut Up!" I hit him. He just gave me this innocent look.  "Oh, the break just going to be a few minutes away, you can go, remember to read chapters 2 and three...” Mr. Rochana said. And we left.  We went to the easternmost part of the school, where the canteen is. The canteen is not exactly a part of school, since it is not owned by them. The operator, Mrs. Eggert, is very fond of us, regulars of her establishment, treated us just like family members, and calling us by our nicknames. It is good to have someone like her around. The canteen itself is secluded, to reach it, we must go past the eastern wall on our school, the path that leads to the canteen has been boarded shut by the school board, but Mrs. Eggert modified it, so she can open the path for us, as long as we have the password, that is.  That place was a refuge for students that didn't want to be seen or heard. The school board are not aware of its existence, and few teachers who do, well, lets just say that they also went there when they are still in high school. Imagine that. You were there to be taught, and then 15 years later, you're going back there to teach others. Talking about loving your Alma matter so damn much.  I knocked at the weatherboard on the wall three times.  "Say It" a voice from behind the wall responded.  "Barudak BC" I whispered. "Barudak" is Sundanese for a group of teenagers. BC is our code for the day :)  The weatherboard opened, I smiled at Mr. Eggert, Mrs. Eggert's husband. We never know his first name, since he doesn't talk much, and the only way he would come out from his office on the back of the canteen would be when he opens the path for us, students. He nods at us and we continue down the path.  "What're you gonna have?" Richard said.  "A coke, a cigarette, and a good explanation from you." I smirk at him.  "Oh, you'll have it soon enough...”  "No tricks this time. I'll cut off your dick if things turn out to be otherwise..."  "Relax... I am doing you a favour this time; you are still a virgin, don't you?"  That bastard. True enough, I am still a virgin at that time. And this dick tried to pull this thing off for me because he had a one-night stand with a girl he met at a club he entered with a fake drivers licence that said he was 22 years old. The girl was 24. Or so I’m told.  "Elaborate...” I gulped my coke.  "Jennifer was looking at you the whole time, man. She is fucking hot, don't you notice?"  "Why would a girl like Jennifer would look at me, man?"  "well, maybe she's into geeks.. who knows?"  "right." I said sarcastically " like it would ever happened..."  Richard lights up his marlboro.  "Relax, you're gonna score this one out. Trust me..."  the word of expectation has come along. I knew that pressure is still on the next corner, but I can almost feel it breathing down my neck. Now I know how Jim Levenstein from American Pie must've felt.  "Look, do you want to do this or not? The clock is ticking. this girl is becoming a hot property, and fast.  I got two seniors giving her the eye, not to mention her ex trying to get her into the sack again, and if you don't take some serious action, and I mean NOW, you will have to pick a number."  Richard grabbed my coke and gulps it down.  "Hot property? Seniors? Jealous Ex-boyfriend? how do you even know these things?" Panic started to show in my voice. how do I even imagine to be up to scale with a competition this magnitude.  "I got sources. reliable ones." He glanced at some girls sitting on a table accross the one we're sitting. "In here, information like this, like all others, comes with a price. but for you, consider I’m doing all this for the benefit of all your kind..."  "what do you mean by my kind?" I said, upsetted by his remarks.  "your kind. stays in the dark. computers all the time. drinks too much soda. it's no good for you.."  "yeah well, this kind of thing has its downside.."  Richard is now looking at me seriously. He lowers his voice.  "Your balls are on the line here my friend." Richard is pointing at me "either you're in or you out. there are no second chance. right now. what's it gonna be?"  [To be Continued...]

       Almost everything in life does not come free. Even if you ponder your thought, even the air we breathe does not come free.  Consider this. You walked into a bar, suddenly your conscience hits you. Where you would rather be? If you went inside, order a beer, have some conversation with the girl next to you, typically you have fun. But say if you didn't went inside. You go home, watch that 21 minutes of Jerry Springer Show about "Was my mother a lesbian?" you've recorded last night, you'll have fun too, or so you thought. But then you make a decision here. Reason dictates that you will want to go to a bar to have some leisure time, and no matter what action you would take while you're in there, does not relevant to what your future path is, let alone watching that Jerry Springer show.  So you're thinking, all right, let's go and have some fun, you plug your tape into that VCR and think, now it is time to relax. You sit back and enjoy the show. You think nothing about what action leads to where. You rather have a conversation with that chick wearing low-cut dress about whether Jennifer Lopez is going to walk down the aisle (again) with Ben Stiller or not, rather than the Goth girl with a sarcastic sense of humour, but she has the ability to port that Playstation 2 I/O code subroutine so you can use the USB port HP Jornada to talk to your PS2. Why? Because you couldn't care less about programming when you're in a bar. You rather watch that Jerry Springer tape you recorded last night than watching American Pie 2 for the umpteenth time. Why? Maybe Stifler's antiques really irritate you this time. But none of this matters. These craps does not have anything to do with it. You're doing it because it's there. End of story. Or is it?  When there is action, there is a reaction. This is argumentatively an interesting topic to ponder our thoughts on. The consequences of our action sometimes went overlooked, because we couldn't care less about small things, but even smallest gesture, like love, is always about small things. Say, one day your girlfriend asked you to bought that One-minute pregnancy test kit because she almost 2 months late. You're being supportive and scared shitless, promised that you will bought 3 different brands, just to be sure (and of course paranoid -- $25,000 pa job and the possibility of having a kid while you're still at uni and taking government benefit does imply a tremendous amount of pressure). After work, you drive straight home because you're tired and guess what? completely forgot to buy that FRIGGIN' PREGNANCY TEST KIT.  Would she upset? Rhetorical question. never mind that. You apologize, and drive like a madman to terry white chemist, have some argument with the pharmacist about which one is the most accurate, and went straight home. you're on your knees and put on some nice words, telling how much she meant to you such and such, you're not being selfish or anything and you're always putting the word "us" before "you" or "me", 25 minutes later. she forgive you. or so you thought. see, she may forgive you, but then the thought whether you really care about her well being would came up again when you two have another argument in the future. and so you two move on, you say you love her and she said she love you, but as the day goes by, it will just add up. and just before you finally would pop up the question, she had enough and leave. so much for a few lines of code back at the office while you can spend those minutes writing a post-it note "NOT TO FORGET: THE FRIGGIN PREGNANCY TEST".  Ain’t life grand. So you see what's happening. Back to our first story. say you hit it off with the girl with the low-cut dress with whom you have a conversation about whether Ben Stiller will get hitched by Jennifer Lopez. On your way outside, you got robbed and stabbed. A 4cm wide stab wound on your left forceps as you try to fight back and dodged the knife and a minor concussion as your head hits the concrete when the bastard delivers a blow which came across too late before you can even think because you're too busy keeping pressure on your wound. the concussion caused an internal bleeding and you went into coma. so much for hitting it off with the girl with the low-cut dress. Should've stayed at home and watch Jerry Springer show about "Was my mother a lesbian?" .  Then again, if you stay at home, just as you thought this would be a good night on the couch, a long-distance telecom company gets recorded in your tape, and for whatever reason, makes you think about your girlfriend, who passed away on an auto accident on Monash Freeway on her way to picked you up after your bosses bachelor party, simply because you're too drunk to drive. A drunk "P" platers lost control of his wheel and spins, crashing into your girlfriend's Peugeot 205 which you gave on her 24th birthday. Then it hits you how much you missed her and realize you can't live without her, and after gulping that whole bottle of J&D , take your own life with a full cap of leftover 500mg valium capsules. You haven't had dinner, you take alcohol and mix them with drugs. nice one.  Seeing how much implication that a simple action, in this case, walking can cause to your life. It can cause you to question your own self-existence and your meaning of life. does it worth it? by all means, of course it is. What you have to remember is to always have hope and a little bit of faith. dare to dream because DREAMS CAN COME TRUE. if you believe in it, you will have it eventually. say you got robbed and went to coma in the process and wake up almost a year later, but you will recover. your next-door neighbour having a party and a glance at your window tells him something wrong, send the medic in and you got your stomach pumped. you got your psyche evaluated and eventually, meet a girl, just the way you wanted. looked like your deceased girlfriend. life suddenly got a new upgrade.  So our morality lesson can be summarized into two: 1)even the smallest action has its own consequences, so be careful on what path you decide to take in this life. 2) Dreams can come true, no matter how gruesome the truth in life is, it also can be wonderful.  Bring forth the notion of this so-called life.

       start up at early morning breeze. sun comes in and lights up our day. wished the good times roll it is now over too soon. enter the routinity the absolute mindless of a soul.  as the world turns and the sun made us averting our eyes. people walking and passes us by with not even a smile. sulking sounds of machinery the humming sound of technology. rapidly changing perceptions motivations acqusitions.  the ticking of the clock advances retaliates against us. note the darker room and janitor cradles roll. traffic jam and gloom in people's faces sipping their coffee. empty space but nobody noticed busy with their own kind.  hollow night sky not even moonlight could touch our existence. sitting not in a dark room anymore but the darkest of the hour. when the wind blows and music starts finally we knew. here I am home but not my heart.

       I've been dreaming of it since i've seen teguh's iBook. and seen it in action without having to get in a queue. It looked gorgeous. powerful hardware, nice design, although the MacOS X which come with it is not a perfect OS, has a few quirks here and there, slow and unresponsive at times, but it is WAY better than win9x/win2k/winxp :) i've left my xp machine at home at around the same uptime as his iBook, albeit it is 100Mhz faster, but the iBook performed exactly that much faster as the previous night, and my xp box slowed down tremendously. Geez. I MUST get one of those. Must set aside about $4500. what the heck. i'm going to own it for a long time. consider it as a long term investment. better start saving. Dual 867Mhz Powermac G4 with 512MB and nVidia GeForce4 MX plus gigabit ethernet... schweeet :P  At least until G5 comes up.  Then I'm fucked.

       well, this week almost come to an end, and, however strange that it may be, there's always something happened during the week, which makes the weekend would end up nicely and beautifully. pure coincidence? think about it. maybe this is the way that living is meant to be. full of surprises, full of contradiction, full of memories. full of joy. full of ... well, u've guessed it :) so, that being put aside to ponder on, long after recovery, the buzz has spoken that honky tonks is the place to be tonite. well, although i haven't been very fond of honky tonks, i'm willing to give it a try, see what we can come up with. :)  have an excellent weekend for you all :)  Note to my fucking self: don't forget to call her during recovery! :P

       i really should get up and do something constructive. for the past 3 days, i've been doing practically nothing after work. i should get into that project, burn that paul oakenfold essential mix CD, or doing some more coding :P fuck, all i did was lying there, sipping coke and smoking, watching edward norton blowing his own brains out in fight club.  ok, there's today, and friday onwards, i won't do anything except for party, so i guess for the next 12 hours, this is the only window i have to do something constructive. for the weekdays i mean. :)

       the pledge of "no more booze, smoke, drugs, one-night-stander, menage-a-trois". i don't think is politically correct for someone at my age group to actually took that pledge. I mean, unless something hits you right in the brain, I couldn't think of anything so drastic, in these days and age, it make you took that pledge. let's face reality here, don't say something that you ultimately will regret in the future. I mean, not until you realize, that this is the time, only GOD is the strength, only my family and GOD need my full and true devotion, then, and only THEN, you should stop and take that pledge. But, for Christ sake, don't take that pledge just because you need a new kick out of life. ever.  well, only my $0.002 cents :)

I couldn't care less. maybe i am a bad person. so what?. people might never change, but they adapt. they react accordingly. condition dictates them to. i might not be the same person as before, and i might never will be.  my "missing" years, it was sweet, but to re-load my saved game? i really should think about it some more.

       what a way to start a week :P wake up at quarter to seven to expect nothing less than sunlight stabbing my forehead, but what actually came, was no sun, cloudy sky, and strong wind. Then , at the office, there's plenty of work to be done, but no paperwork yet! that means i couldn't start with it straightaway, since someone else need to finalize the proposal, etc before i can get the go-ahead. not to mention the daily routine of quota checking, emailing and backups, it is your regular tremendously boring monday morning.  first time i feel a bit depressed after a while (and i didn't even went clubbing last week..)

       at last i'm taking photos again :) masih penasaran sih hasilnya gimana, but it gives me that warm feeling inside. to tell you the truth, seeing photos i've taken, in frames, in someone's living room, gave me a sense of accomplishment, a gratitude, pride. Not only that, but also the nod: "I liked your photos", "I'm gonna reprint this one", "When can we do some more shootings?" . Maybe I should get into serious business and buy some more equipment. tripods, lenses, filters, light meters. Slowly, slowly.  What a fucking expensive hobby.   I should stick to raving.  Nahhhh.. can't help it!. ;)

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  Kehilangan sesuatu yang berharga kadang2 bakal membuat seseorang berpikir, apa artinya memiliki sesuatu, kalo di kemudian hari, itu pada akhirnya hilang, satu mungkin dengan perlahan-lahan, dan mungkin abruptly atau tiba2. Either way, the loss is sometimes too much for us alone to bear. It reminds us of the past, the memories, the values that has been held so highly, is then crushed like two piece of five cents coins. And what would someone feel, if that two piece of five cents coins is their lifeline? Things that keep them going? Things that they cherished for the warm feeling that comes whenever it is in their possession?  I better start thinking more slowly before putting any words at all.

       What can I say? high expectation was poised for this weekend, for everyone that i know of seems inclined to make this night the night to remember. But, as humans can only plan and God decide, here we were, few chosen ones, bashing our eyes on the emptiness of void of viper's nightclub ceiling, trying to capture the essence of light that seems trapped inside the boundary between human sanity and euphoric state of mind. we feel strongly connected with each person in our group, forget about all abilities, commitment, names, possessions, marriage, sculpted into one form of alternate state of mind: love.  and that's all left to it.  next friday, breaktime, but then we can do it all over again :)

       OK, what can be called as frantic beginning of the night , and a slow start, has turned to be all-out, all-night bash. we had about 30-something number of patrons, enough booze and (small other things) to ensure our happiness for the night :-) it is a good thing that everyone seems to enjoy themselves and enjoy the music. I did. as for the what it exactly looked like, without further ado, here it is :)   http://photos.yahoo.com/gsoetris  Enjoy!! ;)

       found a new toy on the web today :) if you're a regular MSN user, maybe you've noticed that there's no logging facilities, or advanced action (/away or /me) like in IRC. but today i found a toy that does it, and more! It's called MSN Messenger Plus!. go and knock your socks off with this. What i liked is the "boss" feature when you can hide those incriminating windows in an instant. Haven't tried the transparency feature yet, but i will when i get home on my XP box!. ;)

       In Memory of those who died, September 11, 2001, World Trade Center, New York City  Someone came up to me last year, and ask if the Yanks (Americans) deserved to be punished this way because of the way (their government) they treated other countries which are not in the same league (nor philosophy) as theirs. I answered "Not in this way, mate, not for anything."  To watched people running in horror, their faces covered with dust and ash, scared shitless, crying and screaming, Firemen running frantically as the first tower goes down. I had to scratch my eyes to make sure i'm not seeing some B-Movie production that channel 10 bought to fill in the gaps between 4 am and "Good Morning Australia". But it is awfully brilliant effects for a B-Movie. Until i realized there's CNN watermark all over the screen.  Fuck Me. My girlfriend (at that time) wakes up. Screamed at me to keep my voice down. I told her what happened. She just stand there, silently.  To imagine how those people died, even as i'm writing this, it brings the chill again. How can a human being, come to a decision to hijack a plane, and smash it into a big skyscraper is beyond me. It seems that "Jihad" (Holy War) justifies killing innocent people. But to take another human life is considered unholy. To tell you the truth, I wish i was there. I wish I could help them, I wish I can do everything that I can to save them. I can't. What I could do, was to light a few candle at Mary's chapel, buy newspapers, browse the websites, and argue with some silly ass, close minded, hypocrite, Moslem fanatics, on yahoogroups, whom persist with his opinion that the Yanks deserved it, big time.  To this day, I still think the Yanks are as arrogant as ever, the acts brought them even more reason to act even more arrogant. Trying to be the peacekeeper of the world. Who do they think they are? I even think they would declare a war on every Moslem country, if they could. But I feel pity for them. so many lives, families, memories, dream, hope, disappears. Life would never be the same again. To cherish, to remember and to live the dream of those who lost, is the least we could do.  If only there's no war. If only...  Vix ulla tam iniqua pax, quin bello vel aequissimo sit potior (Querela Pacis) ----- "Scarcely is there any peace so unjust that it is better than even the fairest war"  G. Melbourne, September 11, 2002

       busy day today. being away for a few hours can do a lot to a person. access routers to be configured, new websites to be maintained and back-up, sending email for confirmed delegation (need to wrote automated script on these) and talk about that new cold fusion project (involved more learning) geez. think "bonuses" as in 5 digits currency. i certainly hope i will get paid well enough. i should. why not? i'm qualified. sort of. few passes at HE, lots of hd's at TAFE. done LOTS of self-taught about cisco routers, might as well take the CCNE exam next year, i only hope i can top my own chart, that's all. score this one off and i'm debt free for a few months -- might be able to throw a party on my b'day :) and what about molskee trying her best to hook me up? few bumps here and there, but can't complain :) al least slowly but surely, i'm getting there (?)

       Not feeling well for the past two days.. explains why I didn't write any entries. I've been listening to Ibiza Annual 2001, which like any other ibiza essential selection (It sucks), has a few decent tracks. Cosmic Gate - "Fire Wire" and "The Journey" sounds great. Don't know if Ibiza 2002 has already come out in Australia, note to self to check it out. Anyway, will catch up with my duties today, hopefully I will finish it before the weekend. It is rather good if you're sick actually, stayed home and eat home-made food, not your usual lunch at the cafe, listens to music and made your own setlist.  Oh, I had a go as well on Bob Sinclar's/Cerrone "Give Me Love". I think this is one of those tracks I normally don't like, but yeah.. it's OK I guess. It is in the same league as "I Feel For You". The rest are just rubbish. At least for me. And last but not least, let's revive the tradition that we can call now "Trance". Have a go for the umpteenth time at Paul Van Dyk - "For an Angel"! which made me fell in love with his works. Enjoy :)

       it has been said, the curtain has been dropped. when i finally learned of what actually happened, i must had it repeated three times in order to be sure, and three times more after pondering whether the blaring stereo didn't impair my hearing. unfortunately, it was not. to my surprise, the whole thing was, in a twisted way, my fault too. If only i was strong enough, if only i was one drink shorter, if only.. maybe it would've been saved.  the whole plot seems to take its roots from an episode of "the secret life of us". Or vice versa. Either way, it sells, even if you want Aaron Spelling to incorporate the plot into an episode of "Beverly Hills 91210", hence our postcode "South Yarra 3141". If i was an outsider, maybe i would feel sick and show remorse because of what has happened. But what is done is done. Another lesson learned hard, losing friendship is .. :( as we advances into spring, all the best that we can do is to forgive, and to forget that all these ever happened. we can only wait, and we wonder....

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  what is wrong sama orang2 ya? hari ini terkesan pendek tapi banyak sekali yang terjadi, perang2an di milis , kebingungan di milis, dan akhirnya bubarnya milis. ampe gue mau reply udah gak bisa. menghela nafas dan mengenang kembali indahnya persahabatan kayaknya cuman 2 hal yg gue cuma bisa lakuin. it does sound corny and anyone can have a laugh about it, but it is real :) sampe sekarang gue belum tau masalahnya apa, walaupun katanya udah di clear. hopefully within a few hours, gue bakal tau gimana2nya. alangkah ironisnya, baru dua hari yang lalu kita seneng2 dan have fun sama2, tapi on the start of a new week, semua udah buyar. but i guess that's part of life, isn't it?

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian. This is a poem in Indonesian. Describing my life of parties/substance abuse. :P  suatu pagi terbangun dan melihat sekelilingku penuh cahaya mentari pagi berseri, suara mobil beiringan di jalan raya dan 'humming' suara komputerku di ruang tengah, alangkah indahnya hari ini pikirku, kucoba bangun sepeti biasa kurasakan kepalaku pusing seperti biasa kurang tidur, tapi aku bisa fokuskan diriku dan berdiri, sendiri lagi dirumahku tapi aku tidak sedih, karena inilah hidupku.  suatu sore kuterbangun hari jum'at sore, jam berapa sekarang pikirku, mudah2an tidak lebih dari jam delapan, kulihat weker menunjukkan jam tujuh lebih sepuluh, aku tersenyum karena malam ini aku akan bertemu teman2ku dan berpesta sampai pagi, aku bangun dan melupakan semua himpitan dan masalahku, walaupun hidupku sederhana tapi hidupku penuh warna, karena inilah hidupku.  minggu pagi kuterbangun tapi bukan dirumahku, kulihat sekelilingku berantakan gelas2 bungkus rokok dan CD dimana2, orang2 masih tidur kulihat jam dinding menunjukkan jam 12 siang, kunyalakan komputer dan kupilih beberapa lagu kemudian ke dapur untuk membuat mie instant, kubuka tirai dapur, dan masuklah cahaya matahari memenuhi ruangan, mulailah minggu yang baru pikirku, aku bahagia walaupun kelihatannya hidupku tak ada arti, tapi yang penting aku masih bisa melihat indahnya hari, inilah hidupku.

       Well, it was a wild night to say the least :) -- We come up late, got stuck at the door (sold out ticket), and when we finally got inside -- I didn't even watch the show :P(well, got to see the exhibition though), everybody was good, everybody was there -- and to no suprises -- everybody was drunk! .. :) Me? can't stop smiling, had 7 or 8 drink, lost count, don't care. Afterparty? even more wilder -- Deep house was on, everybody was asking where? Honky Tonk -- it was planned, and got cancelled when I finally got there, fine, not my cup of tea anyway, went back to BluePols, everybody was getting ready to leave in exactly 1 minute :P  It's been fun -- make sure you check on the image gallery for your pictures.. maybe your one's there :) Next stop -- the weekend! save your energy.. it's just the beginning -- crash!

       discotech generation is a 2001 release CD from gatecrasher -- haven't been listening much of it, but it is actually quite good :) makes me wonder how gatecrasher sound system would really be like -- last time i went, it was 1998, trance is still on, and to tell you the truth, i am really looking forward to see what's there this time around. So this is it, the weekends! after this post, i'll hit the shower and go to chapel to shop! :P hehehe -- if all fridays all like this.. no hard time at the office, everybody feeling friendly, traffic are cool, and no pressure for the coming week.. would life even be more perfect then :)

       I was coming home the other night, and as usual, I got some messages on my MSN. I never turn off my computer, got an ADSL connection, hence my online status. So it's there. Beside the usual chit-chat from old friends, mom asking where in the bloody world i am, work colleges wanting that powertools cd back, it seems that my ex-girlfriend decided to buzz me this time around. Or maybe haunt me. Amazing how your past can always seems to catch up with you. Maybe if we ever live in alternate reality, it wouldn't be so bad after all.  Basically, what she wants this time, is to know how i'm doing. Well, not exactly, since i can't recall seeing a "how are you?" line in her chat window. Instead, she told me that she heard that I've been taking pills :) The marvel of advanced communication technology has never ceased to amazed me. What even more amazes me, is that she reckons that taking pills  is not the "right" way to forget about her. Well dear, let me told you something, if you ever read this blog, I just want to let you know that before I popped my first 1/2, I already forget all about you.  Not that I don't appreciate her concern, of course, but If you know her as well as I am, you would know that she often misjudged me. It's not like I'm trying to find redemption in taking pills or whatever. For me, I found my redemption long ago, after she fucked me for the 2nd time. Taking pills to escape from reality? Sounds like I'm stil a teenager :) Although i was a teenager back then when i took my first, which was always the best one :) -- i wasn't well informed back then, and i must admit it scares me .. but now, i am well informed, and i'm aware of the risk -- i think that's the responsibility every other drug user should bear. Be aware, and like every other path you take in life, If you ever want to be successful, you better will be well informed. :)   Oh, and her? I told her to get stuffed.

"can we stop off at a bank please mate?".  Bars,dancing,snogging,drinking,dropping, Get to club, huge queue's... Blaggers blagging, bouncers bouncing. Gonna be the best night ever, feeling on top form. Inside club, coats in, off and running- Music rocking, dancefloor rammed-more drinks... toilet stop, cubicles full, people waiting...  Hands in the air, people shouting, love this tune, bodies moving - more drinks. This is what its all about... this is life... no bills, no debts, forget about your boss, all that matters is the music, mates, lets have it, have it large... ...sexy girls, sexy guys looking your way, forget your name, where you live, make new friends, get off it, get back on it, don't wanna stop, no-one can stop us, we rule the world..Music stops, everyone back to mine, "can we stop off at the 24hr garage please mate?".  Open house, everyone's here, music on - beats thumping, drinks poured, people dancing, feeling paranoid-get on the decks, more drinks... need to sleep, can't, need to eat, can't, it's all too much, but not enough, people leaving... people sleeping... people gone... roll on next Friday - we can do it all over again...  ...crash.  thanks: paul wright@cube.

       It'a 2pm and I'm halfway through the dayjob. Feeling as sleeepy as hell. I am thinking.. what the fuck has happened? I mean, i don't do anything heavy yesterday, and today is not really a busy day.. even a bit slow, so I'm thinking to get off early. But what the hell is going on? If i haven't sleep for 3 nights in a row that's fine.. but.. this is ridiculous. Now i've read somewhere that one of the coming down side-effects is that it can cause you to have irregular sleepiness, but then why did i experience that after 3 days ? geez, what a twisted little world.

       Another weekend is yet to passed us by. Met some new friends, greet some old ones, and let the good times roll. Well, to sum up the past week, i have come to conclusion that trust has a big price to pay. You put your trust in someone, and that person screws you over. what a way to live a life. seen it happened before. well, not as yet happened, but if it's true, it is going to be a fucked-up kinda thing to live by, isn't it? secondly, i think for these upcoming weeks, I would need to be more focused and code a little bit more often, more intense coding, I would also try to catch a little more sleep each night, albeit it sometimes neccessary to stay up all night and code :P..  and third, for future references, and to let everybody know, triangle-shaped pills DOES exists! How unreal :) -- i wonder if they've make every known shapes by men into pills .. that would be .. inventive :)

       can you feel it? can you see its beauty? when hearts are meant to be. when romance can't be put into waste. when all the things you ever want, are free.  will you go down with it? will i ever know that certainity? the glitters in your eyes tells me, as if the world was ours to have. and all that matters to us was love.  i thought i would never say this, but... listen, i got something to share! don't turn your back, 'cause what i'm going to say are true! if i should choose someone to rule my life, then, what i want, is for you to be by my side.  for you, this heart only will ever belong. when i dance to your favourite song. i may have gotten far without you, but hear this, the best feeling i ever had: was to hear you say to me, i love you.

       seeing her in front of me again, makes me happy, but also sad. question, why do we have to come this way? looking at her packing her things, her clothes, photos, stuff. i almost forgot how she hurt me. seeing her smile, however, i admit that it was one of the things that.. well, i can't get it off my mind.  i guess i do still love her.  i wonder how she feels, how would she would feel if i tell her. that i really do care. when the day was over, and i'm lying in my bed, alone, all i could think was her.  i don't want to feel this way. however, i really miss it.  thinking about someone you really care about. sure i got my sister, but when i'm thinking about her, it is a different game entirely. i'm starting to wonder, is she really the one meant for me? can i really forget her, and had that different feeling?  some days i feel like i really wanted to, because i needed it to be. but for days like yesterday, i wish i could love her like before.

       what a weekend. surprises, suprises. busy and rough day on the set, but not without early morning shock. awaken by the ringing of my mobile, i thought, oh shit, i'm going to be late on the set. but it's only 7:43. picked the call up, and, geez, what are the odds, it's her.  bad news first. my place is a huge mess, i haven't had enough sleep so i'm just sitting there trying to gather my consciousness. but the good news is, i'm alone. and i acted like i don't care.  now you must consider the oddities of this situation. she showed up first thing, to my place, while she told me herself that somebody already set to pick her up at the airport. but then she ride with a taxi to my place? then, at my place, she called someone to pick her up again. if i haven't known better, i'd say she's trying to caught me up in the act.  she stayed for about 1/2 an hour, and then leave. don't feel sad, lost or anything. but i can't go back to sleep. so i spend the morning browsing.  good thing the dishes are FINALLY done. :)

       haven't slept. shooting is at two. the time, was 11.15 am. i need starbucks. extra strong. less sugar. she already left. geez. want to take her home myself, but.. but last night was great. it was wild, the drinks were awesome, and the right people were there. On a sidenote, as some people opposed going clubbing before shooting the following morning, maybe it is best to keep quiet, keep my shades on the next day, and for God's sake, stop dancing!!

       decided to get off work at 2pm, and have my lunch at the city. met with ucok and heidy. catching up, a good lunch, and the usual conversation about weekend:  "are we set for tonight? " "...got to do a few hundred words on the essay, i'll call you back." "who's coming and who's not?" "oh, come on! we all had assignments, and 1000 words came easily with alcohol... :)" "are we drinking or tripping?" "...give me her mobile number, but either way i'm sure she'll be there tonight.." "are we gonna ride with someone? or share a cab?" "..the core team, as always, are going to be there, but they would probably come at 3 am..." "...bloody hell not! i'm not gonna fucking drive there. didn't you remember what happened to that indian guy?" "..you haven't seen him at all for quite a while, haven't you? it happens to some people if their girlfriend is not a clubber." "...i'm soo wasted that time, i almost cried because there's so many shots to be drunk, while i only had half a stomach to handle all of it...." "....her place afterwards. and remember, the party isn't over till the last record spins."   that's right. the party isn't over till the last record spins. maybe that's why i always love weekends.  have a good one, everyone.

       seeing that photo on the age yesterday, makes me realise how little it was, the difference between us and people who are suffering. we're young, and does not have a care in the world. i feel sad, yet enraged. that feeling in my stomach. fuck the fanaticism. what kind of people, justifying killing innocent people, just because they're not moslems?  these people makes me sick.  i was thrown out of a mosque once,regardless i didn't do anything disrespectful.  having a cross on my jeep's RVM makes people turn their heads, while displaying a tasbih is OK.  my ex-girlfriend parents disliked me, just because i don't do shalaat.  my high school principal told us to "respect the fasting season" while quoting "not to have an extravagant christmas celebration" .  what a bunch of hypocrites.  i don't hate the moslems, but sometimes i do wish that the fanatics would die the most horrible death.

       to tell you the truth, it is enjoyable. it's tiring, but enjoyable. of course on the dancefloor at 5 am, you feel tired. but it is also enjoyable. this thing, is different kind of fun. teamwork, cooperation, synchronisation. i mean, i don't usually like team work, since working alone is what i'm good at. but, here i am. teamwork. part of the team. at least in the future, i can say to my interviewer, "i once worked in the movie industry". :)

No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  kemaren ngafe ma mols,tanti,okie,teguh,petty,ajie. it was a long night. these set up are really starting to bug me. pressure at work is one thing. but pressure on this one, well, it makes me a bit uneasy. don't know. maybe i'm stressed. maybe i'm losing my touch. or maybe i just don't like it. maybe i'm just being closeminded. and it is not necessarily finding the right one. it's just as simple as finding one.  but yes, this one i liked a lot better. can't complain so far. i don't know. see what happened this week. masalahnya apa ya? gak ada sih sebenernya, i just hoped that.. weekend kita bisa rame2 ke ...  and have some fun. go mad. :)   seriously, i don't know what the FUCK am I talking about.

       sometimes, on your regular friday night, (or saturday morning), i would sit down, lightheaded, smile upon my face, light up a cigarrete and take a look around the R 'n B room.  the music would be loud, everybody would be dancing, the pitchers and shotglasses are almost empty, and it's quarter past 5 am. i would give the occasional hug and kiss to anyone who's leaving, and drink whatever it is that's coming at me. provided that i have the stomach for it, and then it is the time for self-retrospect again.  do i need all this shit?  on that night, i would thought to myself, this is what all clubbers has been through, anywhere else in this world. PARANOIA. i tried not to think about it that much, and get on with my night, trying not to spoil it for the sake of the morning after. i don't want to feel bad thereafter, so, i dropped it.  but on a wednesday afternoon, like today, i would start to think about last weekend. about the one coming. and yet the question is still there.  do i STILL need all this shit?  sometimes i grow tired, and skipped the whole club scene. i just stayed at home, lying on the couch, not accepting any calls, and watch DVDs, and finally fell asleep by the time the end credits for "Behind Enemy Lines" starts rolling.  sometimes i grow weary, and decided to hang out with my best friends, we would have dinner in the city, and then catch a movie at JamFac. after that we might go to legends and play ball a few rounds. not to forget the "Photo Hunt" and "Jumble Safari". Then I would go home and went straight to bed.  sometimes i'm feeling excited, i would be busy calling people, by the time it's 7 pm, i would know that he or she would be clubbing tonight. i would've went on a mission, picked up my laundry from the drycleaners and i would shave my head, have my dinner, and get ready for the big night.  sometimes i'm feeling active, and i would be in this movie crew whom i been with for the past 3 months, it's half past midnight, monitoring the sound, balancing the eq and gain level, occasional chat between takes, and waiting with anticipation when would this scene ends, so we can start on the next one.  sometimes, i didn't care of it all.  if you asked me what my weekend would be 6 months ago, i would answer: "at home, lying on the sofa with my girlfriend beside me, we were drinking that tetrapak ultramilk, chocolate flavoured, she just made mushroom chicken which tasted really good, and we just finished watching "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone". Tomorrow we would go to Chadstone, do some window shopping. just the two of us. it would be fun!"  looking back, i didn't feel like i was missing something, like i wasn't part of anything. i was part of something, although different from what i am right now. honestly, i missed all that, and it makes me kinda sad. and when i am sad, i don't feel like doing it anymore.  am i ready to leave it again, the clubs, the music, the drinks, the drugs, the people? just for those moments again, coming back to my life? those moments spent together with my loved one. it must've been hurt not to be able to have those moments again, however small it is.  or is it? i don't like to think about it that way. i love the whole club scene. i love it all. the clubs, the music, the drinks, the drugs, the people. i love what my weekends are become. BUT, i also love my old, secure, romantic, slow weekends. weekends where i can spend it caring. where i can share every minute of it with someone i REALLY do care.  i just missed it. but then again, i haven't found someone to share it with. and i'm not ready to leave my speedy and bashful weekends.  yet.  I would leave my apartment, saturday afternoon, 12.30pm, sunglasses on, with U2 playing "Some Days are Better than Others" in the distant.  Melbourne, 18 November 2002

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  6.10 pm  bills, bills, bills, occasionally there's a brochure from the local gym or promos. but only bills for today. sigh. life couldn't get any better than this.  kubuka pintu depan dan kunaiki tangga. masih sepi. orang2 masih belum pulang. diluar matahari masih bersinar. aku tersenyum. setidaknya masih ada matahari. god bless australia for its daylight savings. aku buka pintu depan apartemenku. sepi. suara humming workstations dan kericikan suara pompa air di aquarium. kutaruh kunci, dompet, zippo dan mobile di shelf.  kubuka pintu balcony. terasa angin panas bertiup. kangen itu kembali lagi. entah aku kangen sama siapa. tapi rasa itu selalu kembali. aku teringat kembali ke dua tahun yang lalu. perasaan setiap kali aku pulang.  ahh.. fuck me.. aku kembali ke dalam dan aku kunci kembali pintu balcony. log-in MSN dan cek email. 11 new, 10 unread. beberapa ucapan selamat ultah. kunyalakan TV. ganti baju. kasih makan ikan. ambil cemilan di kulkas. piring2 sudah rapi. dapur bersih. tinggal cucian. besok sore. masih sempat, pikirku. jam 8 nanti aku harus pergi. anak2 film bikin acara buka bersama. setidaknya ketemu orang. entah kenapa, weekend ini aku tidak berselera keluar dan party. aku mau, tapi tidak minggu ini. bahkan untuk ngerokok aja aku malas. mungkin pertanda untuk berhenti lagi untuk ke sekian kali.  aku duduk di depan komputer. tapi aku sibuk dengan remote TV, channel hopping. tiba2 dadaku terasa sesak. aku ingin bisa teriak, ato setidaknya bercerita ke orang yang aku percaya. tentang apa saja. tentang segalanya. tapi aku sendiri. aku punya teman. teman baik. sahabat. tapi kali ini, aku tidak ingin semuanya tahu. rahasia hati? suara microwave. 4 potong party pie. orange juice. bored with tv. tapi masih ada video dari minggu kemarin. ini ke 3 kalinya aku nonton human traffic. but yet, i still like it. maybe because it brings out the clubber in me.  sundown. 7.15pm. time to hit the showers. hari masih panas, but somehow i feel that cold inside. as i entered the bedroom, ada pass "kita-kita" di sydney, tanggal 6 oktober 2000. thinking back. i smiled. olympics. divas dance. holding hands. lovers. friends. best friends.  the water feels cold.  (to be continued...)

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  lampu2 dimatikan. suara2 pintu ditutup dan orang bersalaman. kupercepat ketikanku.. tak kubalas message dari entah siapa di MSN ku. glanced over my supervisor's room -- nobody's there. entah dimana dia.. kulihat jeannete memeluk peter.. sampai ketemu hari senin, katanya. aku tersenyum. aku tahu mereka pacaran. tapi tidak semua orang tahu. ada bekas tempelan foto di monitorku. ada orang lagi memanggilku di MSN. alt-tab and :wq, F5 , and the quotes are there, the items are there, updated nicely. i thought. selesailah hari ini. I ticked "debug /xscripts/trans/module_a.php" on my to do list. and that's it for today, i thought. see you on monday, gerry, have a good one, mate :) -- eddie waved at me. i nodded. everyone's leaving. glanced at my mobile.  nobody called.  aku kangen. tapi entah kangen sama siapa. kumatikan lampu di cubicle-ku. kulihat monitorku yang satu lagi. no traffic spikes. strange. biasanya orang2 bakal stay untuk a few game of CS. tapi hari ini sepi. kuambil kunci mobilku. logged off and head for the parking. nobody stayed. the office is empty. even the parking is empty . it's just me or what, i thought. perasaanku jadi sedih. biasanya aku pulang jam 6.30. chatted for a while, ikutan maen CS, or whatever.  fuck the damn solitude.  kunyalakan mobilku. radio? boring. biasanya aku bawa donal bebek yang bisa kubaca sambil nunggu mesin panas. tapi hari ini tidak. in fact, udah 4 bulan tidak kubawa. entah kenapa i stopped that. aku bercermin di RVM. want to trim the hair. but i wouldn't bother. so i put the shift into R and reversed, within seconds, i was on the road again. no smile on my face, no expectation, no hope, and no reason to believe in anything whatsoever. except in God, that is.

       lonely man feels the burden uphold the pain, staring at empty street lonely man walks the talks sometimes he's tired, but that's his life lonely man wants escapism but he only gain his freedom  ask me something, why does he's so cold and lonely? ask him something, does he ask for this in the first place?  lonely man wants to have his love back instead he got rejection and cold shoulders trying to see what's right and wrong and lead only the life he believed in  what would the lonely man do? if he was torn in two with no one to look after, no one to turn into? if she would only knew, if they only knew, then he would be the wealthiest man on earth.  lonely man walks with me, smile with me, laugh with me but he only laugh to cover himself. lonely man feels on anger, or love, or pain. only if he is released.  if only i can be that lonely man.

       NOTE: Sorry for those of you non-Indonesian speakers. No babelfish yet for English   Indonesian.  Last week was my 24th b'day. I want to say thank you to all who always be there for me:  Jesus Christ & Mother Mary, without You none of this would've happen, my world would become empty and neither are my strengths. Ma & Pa Soetrisno, the greatest parents in the world, terima kasih udah menjadikan aku orang, membesarkan aku secara sederhana, dan mengajarkan aku hidup sederhana. Tak ada satu haripun kusesali dalam hidupku karena ajaranmu. Sahabat dan adikku yang tersayang, Molly "molskee" Surya. "Sometimes you annoy me, and i wish you would shut up, but nevertheless, you always listen to what i said, and I'm grateful". Trance. The music I love, never grows old, the sound of it can make me happy, cry, laugh, excited, all at once. Truly one of the best thing ever happened to me. Friends. I die without you.  'smatter of fact, I died there. but I survived somehow ;)  Thank You.

       sunday afternoon.  "so, did you went to   on friday night?"     "nope. nothing of interest for me there anyway.."  i looked at him and smiled. at first i thought this is one classic episode of a clubber's comingdowns.  "no kidding.."  i smirked. i know EXACTLY what comingdowns feel like.      "well, lately i just got bored, mate, that's all.." "bored of what?"     "you know, the whole club scene. i don't feel like it anymore.."  another classic line, i say to myself. after this maybe comes the remorse, or the punchline "i'm off the (pills/booze/charlie) for good". but before i can say anything, another line comes up..      "i just don't feel like drinking and get drunk lately. somehow, i don't feel excited anymore about partying every weekend. so maybe i'll stay off for awhile.. see if i'm come up with something new.."  i smiled again. he's not there, but close. note that this guy has been clubbing longer than i am.      "i don't even drink to celebrate anymore. last time a friend of mine had a large bash, i only touched the vanilla coke. what do you have to say 'bout that ?"  i laughed and shook my head.  "good on ya' mate.. that's all i can say to ya'.."  a reason is needed at this moment. he didn't mention the classic punchline, and my mouth is about to utter the big "W?" , but by then i saw his girlfriend walking towards us. and then i know that the reason just walked in.      "tell you what, mate, me and my girlfriend are going to sydney for the new years eve, along with a few friends. why don't you come with us?" "thanks for askin', but i reckon i'll stay.."     "aww, c'mon.. it'll be great.." "no, really, thanks for the offer though.."  so there i was, feeling the need to get out, i shook his hand, wave to his girlfriend, and i started walking towards swanston st. i smiled, because i remember, i gave the same reason to someone, years ago, when i thought the club scene is not my brand of beer. but the club scene is always with me, it is where i belong, nothing could ever change that now.  but his words does makes me think about the past.  or maybe because it's almost christmas.  either way, i'm glad i'm out of there in time before any radical thoughts entered my mind.

       I think this is going to be my last blog for quite some time, I need to sort out some things about myself. What should I do, what shouldn't I do, what would be the easiest path to my own self-discovery.  Sometimes I discover the drugs won't work.  I've done fuck-all and my life is about to go down the drain.   Many thanks to myself.

       So this is 2003.  I've been spending times with various people this past year. I've been through a lot last year. Good times, bad times. I guess I shouldn't complain. Although the world isn't exactly a better place for me, I learned my lesson. Some I've learned it hard, some of it just easy as raising your hand. But one thing I regret the most, I'm missing Welcome 2003 and Summadayze!! FUCK!!! Sister Bliss and Timo Maas!! Oh well.. there's always Welcome 2004 hehe :P  But seriously, I regret falling in the fucking love. Brought nothing except chaos. I'm better off without it. Am I? Think again. It's my own fault. faulty. fuck. don't care. fucked. fucked really hard.  Oh Well.  I'm still fucked.

       Fuck it's been hard. Moving in/out is really a FUCKING PAIN. Not only it's expensive and tiresome, but Opening up boxes, arranging your room, decor etc etc. I mean, really, who cbf with all this?   Oh well. This is actually quite good. I live about 300 m away from the nearest station. Coming to work should be easy. A Chinese takeaway nearby (although it's not as good as). A convenient shop for milk, paper, cigs, etc. And PIZZA PARLOR!! Who can live without them. Parking should be a breeze. One train stop to asian groceries, two stops from cinemas, one stop from the nearest club (Room680). Congratulations to myself, my life is now convenient.  hehe.. at least until i got my room sorted and redirect all banking/mail/videos here.  ahh.. still a pleasant summer.

       This is a party that I've been saving myself for the longest time. And it was good. Like last week, I stepped out from the front door alone, but still, it doesn't bother me at all. I feel confident about having a good time! I love PvD's work, and i think it's all that matters ;)  And what an amazing night that was.  Tracklist-wise, it was good, he played his new track - nothing but you (feat. hemstock and jennings) which is, um.. maybe we shouldn't say new, because he had it hammered last year during his sets in Ibiza.  as per usual he had PvD vs. Marco V - For a Revolt!  Nice T-shirt too btw!  Can't sleep.  Great. I can expect my pic to be up on ITM anytime soon. FUCK.  I should learn how not to gurn, and only gurn when asked. ehehehe ;) better add that to my to-do list.

       It has been quite some time after my last party. Nick Warren, a renowned Global Underground DJ. Finally I can go and have a party after the long, freakish month that I had. I finally got some time to sort myself out and get rid of myself of all the negative vibe and/or energy that has been surrounding me for some time.  I had a good time.  For the first time ever on my clubbing life, I went out the front door alone. all by myself. Not that I care. I had a fun time. Actually, it is a bit daunting at first, because I don't know anybody. But when I got there, people actually started talking to me and ask me to join them, and probably call them if I want to go out the next time so we can go together.  Nice.  I'm starting to feel good about myself. I haven't had that feeling in a long while.  Oh, nice to hear that Coldplay - Clocks (ID? Remix), he also played lots of tracks from his new GU ;)

       meh.  brain severely damaged. hehehehehehehehehe. ;) Armin was good. John 00 was good. FUCK almost the entire trance lineup is good. Missed Dave Seaman though. Not to worry, he's a frequent visitor. What a night that was. I'm beginning to understand how this "shuffle" works. The feet must be synched with the beat. That's it. From then on it's Improv and practice, practice, practice. Anyway, I won't go front and centre until I can dance well enough. Or know the music enough, for that matter. I think this will be my ambition for the year. To know the music better than ever :) If last year was more like experimental stage where I would try to go out as often as I like, I'll become more picky about what sort of music I will listen when I'm going out.  Trance, of course.  Now back to recovery with my brains. *Playstation is Fun!*

       I've been going out to this 5am thing for a month now. It's so far, the best fucking club night I've ever been to (not that I've been very active in the scene for long -- just started last year.) Anyway, it is very nice to finally met Leah, Duncan, Ben, Nick and the likes. I've been visiting the tranceaddict.com for quite some time now, and to be honest, it is very refreshing to meet people who share the same enthusiasm for music as I am. And to put names into faces ;)  Well, looks like my membership card is in the mail, so yeah. hehehe $5 entry for me ;) It's funny because now i've learned a new lingo and it sort of opened my eyes -- fuck these people know how to party hard, i mean REALLY REALLY hard. And I thought I was a hard partygoer.  So this is the thing. It is not only how hard can you party, it is also how LONG can you party and how normal you can be at the end of the day. hehe ;)  It's an education not to be missed. ;)

       So George decide to paint the living room white, with grey lining (I don't know what you builder types call that bit on the bottom and door/window frames are). It's looks OK (I guess). It's nice to have white colour. I began to suspect that WHITE is my new BLACK (OK now that's sounds a bit gay).   Guess I should help him paint. But sometimes I'm too scattered on the weekends, and can't really help him on weeknights since I'm always out too.. hehehe ;P  FUCK i'm too lazy for my own good.

       Another TV show. Cop show. Why we need yet another cop show, you say. To keep us up to scratch, here are my favourite TV shows I've been following up, excluding  the X-Files of course: -	Alias -	CSI Miami -	The Shield -	Frasier -	The Simpsons Now. I can go on and on about Jennifer Garner here, but I.ll leave that for review for the time being, at least until 7 shows the ACTUAL episode(s) when she FINALLY: -	wears the red lingerie -	wears the black lingerie -	came up from the pool all dripping wet and looking hot -	walking and stripping her bikini top (shot from behind here, mind you!) -	took that dramatic shower (sounds like that 11 minutes porn i got from the net somewhere)

       Recovery. I like recoveries. No, that would be an understatement. I love recoveries.  milk, orange juice, yoghurt, banana, jelly, fruit punch, dvds, playstation, stuffed animals. when i stare at the people I passed, I tried to think how much they are missing out. it makes me realise how privileged I am to be here.  To listen to trance. To dance with some awesome people. To be just who I am.  I saw 60 minutes on telly yesterday. It's not often that I watch 60 minutes. Usually I went for Everybody Loves Raymond, but not last night. Why I watched it? It got xtina Aguilera! You can draw your own conclusion and/or fantasy about her, but I am not here to talk about it. Anyway, the point of the whole segment is to discuss her change of image, from "squeaky clean" to "slut", basically. And well, while being totally objective, I do find that her fashion style does seem to make her a little "cheap" at times. But here goes my opinion about it. With all the things that going on the world today, terrorism, crumbling economy, injustice, degrading culture, people only wants certain things that would enable them to get on with life COMFORTABLY. People want to be comfortable. They got enough stress as it is. They don't want to be terrorized. They don't want to be pushed around, to be an object of other's malice or injustice. Somehow they only want a shelter that they know will guard their sanity or freedom from others who wants to take the jam out of their donuts. And this is want xtina's new image is all about. She just wants to be herself. We all are. It frees us from all locks that bind us to this somehow dysfunctional society where reality can be served on a glass screen in time for dinner. It makes all of us stand tall, makes us proud of what we really are, not some standard set by a reality TV show producer. What is reality anyway if you can just dial an 1800 number to change some nobody's life? It is a good thing that she can be her real self and able to put some food on the table. Many of us don.t. I mean, how many of us can leave most of our clothes at home; exposing our skins and one too many body parts at work and gets away with it? I say, we can all relate to her on our very own chosen profession. I played J.S. Bach in the office, while I'm working. Not that I can even ID the tracks on his set, but who would've thought that trance runs in my blood? Who would've thought dancing the night out away would makes me happy just being myself? So for those of you following other's standard, ask yourself this: what is your own standard of happiness? Do you must be someone else to be happy? Does other people's opinion matter to you when it comes to your own self-esteem? It may be good to relate to xtina's footsteps. As for others? To put in her own words: "If you don't like it, you don't have to look at it." I'll just leave wearing a minimal set of clothing items in your own indiscretion.

       I got a new flatmate now. If you've been following my blogs, (or stalking, for that matter) you will know that George went back to JKT to get hitched. Goodbye and Good Luck!! hehe ;) Anyway, Handy is my new flatmate, born and raised in Pematang Siantar, Indonesia --- It's a small village (or should I say town) on the Northern part of Sumatera (correct me if I'm wrong, a bit rusty on my geographic knowledge of Indonesia.)  A student type, into his canto-pop and gospel-rock. Good kid. Shame he's not into trance. Nor into nightlife, for that matter.  Welcome to my humble abode.

       Shit! I just fucking realise something. I can't believe that I've been so dependent on google nowadays, I started referring search keywords to people to use in google search. Not that it's a bad thing. I fucking love Google. Google is the Internet. The Internet would be lost without google. I got to hand it to Larry and Sergey. Fucking hell, if they mess around with their algorithm just for the kick of it, imagine how many life will be lost and how high the crime rate will fluctuate (OK yet another exaggeration here). But do you see what I mean ?  Too bad can't find a girl who loves trance on Google.  Maybe.  hehe :P

       OK,  To listen and dance to John 00 Fleming is one of the reason why I love trance so much. It can be slow and deep, driving and melodic, fast and hard. This is truly one of the best night of the year. He outdone his last visit at TT2002 (2003?) fuck I'm still scattered hehe :P  Anyway.. can't ID most of his track (as usual -- I know he played Gothica and some of his own productions) -- that track he did with M.I.K.E , then a real techtrancer at 3 hour mark ... then some other psy trance tracks which sounded so fucking wicked! ;)  Met some Hard Kandy kids as well ... hehehe ... what a surprise .. I don't see lot of Indonesians coming to this kind of internationals (Trance).. Meh. can't stop gurning.   Maybe doing laundry will do me good.

       Monday, August 11, 2003  Yes kids, it's yet another day in paradise. Cold paradise. We had a bit of shower in the morning. It's funny really. I had this dream last night. It's very vague as always. I can't even fucking remember what it was all about.   ?  Anyway. at least I have something to look forward tonight. nice dinner. alias on 7. frasier. And 4 more sleeps to san trancisco #4. now I would like to talk about that. how good is that going to be? it's been a month since I was last out for a good time. Is it? what a long break that was. a break was not what I had in mind last night, but I decided to have it anyway because I think it would do me good. It is always good to make a comeback after a short while. This friday would be almost definitely, yet another solo flight.  Not that I mind tho.   For the past 6 months, I've been going out alone. I think it's worth the trouble. I also think that this is the best way, because I don't have to worry about anything else except myself. Who to go with? Who.s got the ticket? Who will sort me out? how to get home? I wonder why do I would even bother with the unneccessary neccesities in the first place. I'm going out to have fun. So I will get my own ticket. I will sort myself out. I'm going home for recovery. (or anyone i just met ;)) And I will take the train home, thanks. And that will be sweet. Really.

       OK, so this is two years down the track. I can't really say that I'm still sharing the same sentiment two years ago, let alone a year ago. What really change since then?  Does the world becomes a better place? Less Hatred? More people smiling at each other?  Big FUCKING no.  Instead we got death, american arrogance, IT downturn, commercialism, child slavery, suicide bombing, fanaticism, and even more death.  I will light a candle for the victims. I will also light a candle for this world.  This is for you: Olive - You're Not Alone.

       my chest pounding. my mouth was dry. sore throat. no taste left in my chewie. fuck i'm thirsty.  you'd think i'm feeling like hell but i feel really, really great.  light a ciggy. took a mouthful of water.  it was a little over 5am and it's the PEAKTIME MADNESS!!  JulesPLees dropped the needle to Airscape - Esperanza  .. don't know which remix -- but it really does it.. the opening riff is enough to make everyone in the dancefloor goes mental. and so am I.   its all good!   my world, kids! ;)

       What a night that was! ;)  M.I.K.E played lots of his classic remixes. Marco V smashed all of us with Coldplay - Clocks (Marco V Remix) Cosmic Gate brought one of the most memorable encore ever - Firewire! *the whole floor went mental*  Was so scattered at recovery. I had nosebleeds after recovery. I had tremendous amount of fun. Was one of the best night of 2003.  Now, off to find my munted pics taken by ELLWAY that night ;)

       35 days to holiday. 840 hours. 50400 minutes. 3024000 seconds. and downcounting. you know, i got a lot of things in this life. and for some, i am grateful. today, it's the weather that comes to mind. we got some sun today. and i'm working. i bitched about it yesterday.  but actually, it is quite enjoyable. enjoyable enough that i'm actually smiling on the way to the office.   i really want to ask her out. she's cute. she like trance!  she made me laugh. she can dance. she knows how to have a good time. but she's unavailable to unknown reason. but i'm not losing any sleep over it. besides she already had her 3 strikes.

       I woke up one day, and saw the sun is shining, a glance to the buzzer tells me that it's half past seven, the time to wake up if I want to avoid the morning traffic on my way to work. I am sweating because of a hot summer morning. The ever-present humming noise from my computers and the constant ringing in my ear perpetually awakens me. Although I am still a bit sleepy, I am happy. Maybe today's just another day, like any other day, but I am excited, because I am not alone, the music is always there for me. This is my life.  On a Friday afternoon, I came home and find no bills nor letters inside the letterbox. I greeted my flatmate and asked what are his plans for the weekend. I am so glad that the weekend is finally here. I went to my room and play a liveset I just downloaded last night. Now I will have my dinner and after that, I will have a shower before I leave, for my weekend has just started. I had my problems, and I never forget about it, but it seems little and insignificant. I just smiled, because I have a colourful life. This is my life.  It is 10am, Sunday morning, and  I wake up in my room. Still fresh in my memory how good the past two days was, how I enjoyed myself to the fullest, and I laughed . I got up and opened the window. I am not sleepy, although my feet is still a bit sore and my throat was dry, I'm feeling great. What a beautiful day. I started the kettle for a cuppa and opened up my browser. While it runs, I went to the kitchen again and prepared my breakfast. Some rice and stir-fry. It's a new week, I thought. Later I will go to church, and meet some of my closest friends. I am happy. I'm happy with my life. This is my life.

       Yeah, pretty much another birthday for me. Thank you is in order.  Jesus Christ & Mother Mary, without You none of this would've happen, my world would become empty and neither are my strengths. Ma & Pa Soetrisno, the greatest parents in the world, without you there would be no one to look up to. The 5am Crew. Thanks for bringing up the best trance night that i would go months after months. Keep it up! Trance. The music I love, never grows old, the sound of it can make me happy, cry, laugh, excited, all at once. Truly one of the best thing ever happened to me. M. For surprising me while I'm peaking. Fuck that was good hehe. :P Friends. I die without you.  As for Dave?  Chable & Bonicci - Ride (Original) Eurythmics - Sweet Dreams (Acapella Edit) Coldplay - God put a smile upon your face (Hernan Cattaneo Remix) Chable - Melburn  It was good. ;)   FUCK i'm 25 now.

       now that was a mess. what a farken trip. and what a farken trip!!!. almost anything imaginable that can go wrong, went wrong. how can that be. maybe its tiredness. maybe it's something else. dammit. think. think. think. or does the pills beginning to take its toll? nope. it's just me and my  farken poor focusing ability. impaired by weather. fatique. etc etc.  sydney roadtrip for work. not farken ever again.  OK, it's 17th of December. a week away from christmas. haven't done my  shopping yet. prolly because of work. and i got better things to do. like farken what? after work it's DVD time. or HK Cinema time. and it's farken hot!! couldn't be bothered. Prolly I'll buy a new shirt. and  shoes (maybe). prolly not. depends.   feeling a bit under these past few weeks. haven't been eating properly. I do want to eat properly but something always keeping me from it. Like weekdays for example .. couldn't be bothered to shop. takeaways  would be the menu for most of the days. Then weekend comes. it's either takeaways (again) or dining out. farken got to stop this.  on a lighter note, it's almost christmas. jolly good times are here again. i think the most memorable christmas was some 10 years ago when i am still living with my parents. sunday morning, bbq, backyard. ahh. had the same last year. bbq. backyard. plenty of friends. farken one glass of wine. the i had to farken drive. but seriously, christmas spirit is the one that's important.  this friendster thing is becoming a hit. i mean, i open up one of my friend's page. and WTF? WTF are this people? seriously, i got 2 friends in my friendster page, and i already had like 27,000 names in my personal network. imagine if i had like 20 or 30 friends for example. hmm... not an easy task.  hehe.. bailing out of a party. it is gettin a bit boring, don't you think ?

       to tell you the truth. NYE/NYD was fun. my last 4 parties was fun. my last 3 actually. the one in the beginning of december was sucked. farken hell. i'm sitting down high on my farken ass listening to miss mel. fuck. and i realised now that she sucked. period. pulser - my religion again? it's just i'm not really there. listening to it sober really does open my eyes. to imagine that i used to think she played good trance. anyway. it's viper again on the 17th. still not sure if i'm down with it. maybe not. it's armin in 2 weeks and another 5am on 3. haven't played room for so long. so january has 5 weeks, and i'm doing 3 out of 5. not a bad start. february originally has pvd but he has been bumped for april. so it'll be a slow month. 5am, transcend. no internationals. yet.  livesets. ah yes. haven't done much in that department either. had a promo set from cameron @nova969 sydney. Nu-NRG. and another one from Andre Visor. haven't really listened to them proper. i beginning to feel i'm listening lesser and lesser trance. maybe because the tracks are overplayed? i really need to get some ASOT sets. and soulseek is the answer. but with no broadband? might as well get a turntable with no stylus. also i notice that i'm doing lesser computing? what the fark is wrong with me? I think i will need this C++ exercise. it will do me good. i never really got strong in these kind of area. networking and stuff are cool. but it would be awesome if i can code in more language. to think of it, all aspect of my farken life has been slow in january. less cash flow, less job, less music, less computing. let's just hope things would improve.

       Ahh back to work at last. I'm so relieved.  WHAT THE FUCK am I saying?!????!!?!?!  I can count my braincells with one hand, let me tell you. Oh man, what a major braincase that was. Between having 3 days sleep-deprived, exhausted of energy till the point of inexistance, or feeling like a sub-human due to amounts of substances pumped into my system, this is by far the most enjoyable NYE/NYD celebration i had in the past 4 years!!!  Highlight at together is of course running around trying to find anybody I know (this is a sarcasm for you who hadn't noticed! :P)  But seriously, I enjoyed Tiesto! Really! Although 4 1/2 hour set is a promise unkept, still i didn't let it ruin my night :) Street Spirit (Tiesto Remix), Traffic, Tribal Shock, Silence, Born Slippy, Loops & Tings ... ;) ;) ;)  but still seeing 45yr olds vietnamese group or old ravers bring shivers to my spine :P :P :P  FUCK. there it goes again.  lost 3kg. not bad for a NYE/NYD standard. At least i'm not losing any valuable possessions. maybe dignity if my munted photos were taken (AGAIN!)   ehehehe...   Let's get back to work shall we....

       So yesterday I got a mail from my high school sweetheart. Very heartwarming actually. It's nice to hear from her again, because, folks. If you've been a good stalker, you will know that the character "Jessica" from my story 2 years ago was based on her.  Yeah, so we share stories about how great our NYE party was hehe ;)  Then it hit me. FUCK. She's taking bickies now. Where were you when we're getting high, darling?!?  So I guess we just grow old apart. She seems surprised that I don't have any girlfriend.   Not that I care ;)  Invited her to friendster, see if she still hated technology ;) We'll soon see!

       Ahh.. that time of the year again, almost the end of summer, sounds of petrol, rubber and grid girls giggling :P (WTF?) Hopefully this will be the definitive start of party season of 2004. Lots and lots of international are coming, and  the lineup for this year's TT is so fucking massive, you'll be crazy to miss it.  And it's all happening tomorrow.  After that, there would be two options:  1) No Review Post -- too scattered, too busy collecting brain matter. Partying too hard. 2) There is a review post -- enough strength, enough sanity, not partying hard enough.  Most likely it will be option #1.  See you there, kids!!! ;)

       I cracked myself up when I saw it. But still wouldn't it be so cool if it was true?  -- From http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html Google Copernicus Center is hiring  Google is interviewing candidates for engineering positions at our lunar hosting and research center, opening late in the spring of 2007. This unique opportunity is available only to highly-qualified individuals who are willing to relocate for an extended period of time, are in top physical condition and are capable of surviving with limited access to such modern conveniences as soy low-fat lattes, The Sopranos and a steady supply of oxygen.  The Google Copernicus Hosting Environment and Experiment in Search Engineering (G.C.H.E.E.S.E.) is a fully integrated research, development and technology facility at which Google will be conducting experiments in entropized information filtering, high-density high-delivery hosting (HiDeHiDeHo) and de-oxygenated cubicle dwelling. This center will provide a unique platform from which Google will leapfrog current terrestrial-based technologies and bring information access to new heights of utility.  Why a lunar location?  It's a logical question to ask. Google's current engineering facilities in the United States, India and Switzerland are all leaders in search technology development. However, by locating a research and technology center on the Moon, Google engineers will be able to experiment with an entirely different set of parameters. For example, imagine tapping unlimited solar energy to drive megawatt data centers and power innumerable arrays of massively parallel lava lamps, with ample no-cost cooling available to regulate the temperature of server farms sprawling over acres of land unblighted by sentient lifeforms or restrictive zoning ordinances.  Moreover, Google's Copernicus Center will provide a clear ear on the chatter of the universe, the vast web of electromagnetic pulses that may contain signals from intelligent life forms in other galaxies, as well as a complete record of every radio or television signal broadcast from our own planet. Google's goal is to extract information from that cacophonous web and make it available to anyone with a mouse and a modem. Imagine discovering not only alien attempts at communication with Earth, but also such heretofore unavailable cultural treasures as Pink Floyd's 1968 appearance on the BBC and the tragically lost first season of "Iron Chef."  With the establishment of the Copernicus Center, Google's mission has grown beyond "organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful." Our new goal is to "organize all the useful information in the universe and serve it to you on a lightly salted cracker."  What are the challenges?  The first non-trivial challenge is building a lunar base. Google began drawing up plans for the construction of a lunar facility in the Copernicus Crater early in 1998, when the company's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were still graduate students at Stanford University. Applying a Patel extrapolation to Rosing linear projections, Page and Brin predicted that every man, woman and child on earth would be conducting at least seven searches a day by the year 2018. While their projections correctly predicted random spikes in search traffic due to wardrobe malfunctions, they failed to adequately factor in the hyperbolic trajectory of Britney Spears, which accelerated the rate of global search growth by a factor of seven.  Google's initial base, a spherical structure containing living quarters and a small data center, will take two and a half years to construct. This first G.C.H.E.E.S.E ball has been christened "the Googlunaplex" and will be populated by a dedicated cadre of software engineers, hardware operations technicians, cable installers, quantum mechanics and space planners. Google is firmly committed to using only earth-originated staffers and no jobs will be outsourced to lunar residents or those from other planetary systems unless the skill sets they offer cannot be easily replicated by native born terrestrials.   Searching the heavens  Once the facility is built, the real work begins. Google will be exploring a number of exciting research projects that have the potential to advance search science to a new frontier. Among the questions Googlunars will seek to answer are:      * Exactly how far does the Worldwide web extend? Can it become an interplanetary utility? If so, will it replace Water Works on Monopoly®?     * What are the likely effects of link attenuation over extreme distances? Is there a limit to link strength, or is it infinitely extensible like bubble gum that gets stuck to the bottom of your shoe?     * What happens to PageRank in the proximity of a black hole? Is there distortion that might result in link relevancy reduction or popularity warping? Could this somehow be harnessed to generate more dates for engineers?     * Does spam go on forever?  The rules of coding will literally be stood on their head at the Copernicus Center, as the absence of gravity plays havoc with the normal ordering of data. Search results lacking in substance may rise to positions of prominence while those possessed of a desirable gravitas may become negatively buoyant. Simple computing exercises, such as building a list inverter become problematic when "up" or "down" are not clearly defined, and subroutines are disrupted when values increment six times faster than in Earth gravity.  Obviously, a new set of tools for computing in the unforgiving conditions of deep space is needed. This month, Google will release version 10.0 of an operating system that has been optimized for the demands of extra-terrestrial computation. Known as "Luna/X," the new command architecture is impervious to radiation, low gravity, absolute zero temperatures and airless environments. Even the most intricate scripts coded in Luna/X can withstand the harsh conditions of lunar operation for months, if not years.  Luna/X will be made available to terrestrial developers free of charge and a testing environment will be constructed to replicate the conditions under which the code will likely be deployed. Through a partnership with an as yet unnamed hamburger chain, Luna/X engineers will be able to simulate a lunar work environment by ingesting tasteless freeze-dried nutritional byproducts while coding in noisy, crowded quarters suitably lacking any trace of atmosphere.  Life in the Googlunaplex  The Googlunaplex is a working environment that will be unique both because of its location and its design. Based on a working model constructed by Google co-founder Larry Page from Lego® Mindstorms™, the facility features compact living quarters and a state of the art server farm that are co-mingled to maintain a delicate bio-technical balance. In traditional Google style, space will be used with extreme efficiency, with Googlunars sharing quarters with machines that generate search results as well as enough heat to warm the entire Googlunaplex and several hot tubs.  Naturally, Google's earth-based culture will be replicated as closely as possible. An extreme sushi chef will harvest kelp and aquatic life from giant lava lamp oxygenators and the living space will be filled with colorful rubber balls (because of space constraints, they will be sub-atomic in size). There will be a steady supply of snacks and ample caffeine replenishment through a partnership with Starbucks, which will be opening a store less than a kilometer away in early 2006. Leagues for reduced gravity roller hockey games are already forming and massage therapists are undergoing special training on how to induce stress to counter the effects of a low-gravity lifestyle.  Thrust yourself to the forefront of search  If you're intrigued by the opportunity to launch a new career, now is the time to step forward. For more information about the Google Copernicus Hosting Environment and Experiment in Search Engineering, please contact us today at lunarjobs@google.com.  Applicants must be at least 18 years of age by April 1, 2007 and have proof of earth residency. Google is an equal opportunity employer.  --   sounds fun huh? I wish i can (and smart enough to) work for google. ;(   ah well..   back to work...

       I've been a PvD fan for 4 years now. I love almost every piece of music he produced, and I will catch him whenever he's on tour here in Melbourne. But as of late, some of his sets are, well.. I hate to say this.. dissapointing. :(  Don't get me wrong, the PvD sound that I grew to love and the energy contained in his sets are still there. But I don't want to hear every single track pitched to +7 (this is an exaggeration of course). Take a look at his recent Mayday Set.  01 Marcos - Red Bullet (Muzikman Mix PvD Rework) 02 Carlo Resoort - Musica 03 Paul van Dyk feat. Second Sun - Crush (Vandit Club Mix) 04 J.L.N.D - The Sound Of Nothing (Arc In The Sky Remix) 05 Terry Bones vs. Fred Baker pres. Water Planet - Introspection (John Askew Remix) (PvD Re-Edit) 06 Airscape - Sosei (F&W Remix Paul van Dyk Rework) 07 Agnelli & Nelson - Holding Onto Nothing (PvD Original Edit) 08 Emmmanuel Top - Mars (Kai Tracid Remix) 09 Iluminate - Montevideo (Paul van Dyk Rework) 10 Kay D. Smith & Marc Tall pres. Passive Resistance - Praiseworthy Tunes (Hoipolloi Mix) 11 Mojado feat. Mr. Sam - Naranja (Dimitri Andreas Vision Mix) 12 Love Fist - Hanging On A String (E-Craig Mix) 13 Paul van Dyk feat. Vega 4 - Time Of Our Lives (UK Club Mix) 14 Nick Lunn & YOMC pres. Tecno Punx - Energize (Paul van Dyk Edit)  Some good tracks there, but not if pitched to +7. Furthermore, 18 months onward, he still have Crush, Holding Onto Nothing, TOOL, Energize on his sets. I mean, OK. those tracks were good. For its time. Even the one not as jaded as we are knows that track. Crush, Holding and TOOL are played since Mayday 2003 onwards. Can't you come up with a new production Paul?  Well, hopefully he will come to his senses and progresses his style to a direction where it should belong.  We can only hope.

I'm still a tranceaddict at heart. There is no fucking way i'm changing the music I follow so religiously.  But I can't get rid of that track off my FUCKING HEAD.  struggle,struggle,struggle,struggle,struggle.  That is the alcohol talking. I'm gonna get through this.

       Now that was a fun movie. I reckon this third installment of harry potter is the best one from all three. A more darker side of the story, in contrast with the other two was one thing that makes me more interested to see the movie.   And I'm glad I went.  Here we have Harry, Ron & Hermione on their 3rd year at Hogwarts. My feeling about this movie is that it over so soon, I reckon it was pretty much fast-paced, but the beauty of the movie still lies within the wizardry effects and the characters. Teenage angst within harry, the "will they/wont they" tension between Ron/Hermione, the somewhat irk administration of wizarding authorities.  And maybe Kate whatshername who played hermione is getting hotter. :P  The plot stays true to the book and retain many of the dark elements that present inside the book. Although this is due to JK Rowling's constant supervision of the script and shooting, I applaude del Toro's directorial effort for bringing up this movie in all its glory.  My Score: 4.5/5

         June 21 2004.    Messy.      Now.      hahahaha. OMG.    yeah that one word pretty much sums it all up.      I better took just a quarter with "greens" otherwise i can't fucking function    the next day. Its that and lack of sleep too ;)      well not much I can recollect from monday, except that I woke up at 7, cold,   sore throat, sore feet, not enough sleep, miserable as hell like i've been   burdened to carry 8.2308147% the weight of the earth. then I stagger to my   comp just to send an email off to my boss, letting him know that I have HAVE   HAVTA take a sickie. then turning the ringer off my mobile and slept (again)   all the way to quarter past three.      apparently my boss left 3 msgs and called me 6 times while i was asleep.      FUCK.      hope i won't get sacked for this. I called him at the office and asked what   was the emergency. server crashes? ups battery failure? upstream link down?   access lists blocking port 80 somewhere? quota problems? a major bug which   lets accounts to bypass checking?      turns out he needed some warez cracks.      FUCK.      can't these people leave me alone for awhile.??!?!?!      oh well. back to work now.      what? do you want to know about bassic?      look here:  urlLink http://www.ellway.com.au/gallery/photos/bassic     a picture spoke a 1000 words ;)

       Ahahaha. Finally I got what I want out of one of my favourite DJ. Involver is, in my opinion a good compilation. It is not a masterpiece, however. Again, it definitely had that Sasha sound, lots of ambience, quirky, ecletic sounds.  The tracks that I like best are :  Sphongle - Dorset Perception. Felix da Housecat - Watching Cars Go By.  Only two? Yes, I'm afraid. Petter, In a State and one other track which I can't remember the name -- which I already heard in livesets. Old tracks. Doesn't interest me much, petter - these days is a good bridging track btw, but yeah. you know what I mean.  Anyway, I still think balance 005 outclassed involver, and the concept of involver is not new, it has been done before by PvD - Politics of Dancing, which has every track re-done, re-edited, re-arranged, re-fucked by PvD. It's a good CD, btw ;)  My score: 4/5

       I'm really pumped to come to this particular party, because:  - It's a warehouse rave party, which means it should have the good bouncing sound of a warehouse. - It's in the bloody sticks, where it should be. Where all underground raves should be. - Everyone should, and will be there. Should be fun. - It's not commercially advertised -- Only on their website and word of mouth. - No alcohol licence -- no fucking bogans trawling the dancefloor with a VB attached in their hand. - It will have an atari in the chill out area, we can play some oldskool games ;) - No superstar DJs will be playing, only people whose passionate about their music! - I just LOVE    /me signing off --- now where's my fucking melways?

         Friendster, being still in beta, is a piece of interesting software. Examine   the following observations:      - Friends automagically disappear and reappear after browser refresh.    - Persistent Testimonial Approval/Disapproval page.    - Missing Personal Messages Entries (only blank tempate comes up).    - Picture(s) automagically hidden ?      Sometimes i just don't care, sometimes it's irritating, sometimes it annoys,   sometimes it just plainly pissed me off.      I know the feeling .. testing a beta software, it's almost finish, but we're   not quite there yet. swamped with feedbacks almost 24/7 constructive and   desconstructive, useful and useless, positive and negative.      hope they'll do the scheduler better in the future.

       Now kids, how good is Zabiela ? ;)  FUCK. two tracks playing at the same time, multiple loops, multiple cues, layered effects, scratching, scratching over vocals, scratching at different tempo on both (!) CDJs, reverse play, tight mixing, effectively remixing every track. FUCK.  can't even ID two tracks :P  Blur - Song 2 (ID? Remix) -- I heard it was Andrew Padula (?) who remixed it.  As you may have already concluded, I had a good night. A very good night, in fact. It's $45 bucks well spent. Good vibe, a bit mixed crowd.  And you know what? I met two of my old friends. One is likely to be there, and another is VERY unlikely.   Enter Airin & Petty.  FUCK i'm instantly peaking when I saw them hahaha ;)  But seriously kids, I am just so happy to see them again, because I haven't seen them for a long long time .. and what makes me even more surprised -- Is how someone from RnB background can have such a ball in a prog party.   After recovery the next day, I made a promise to myself, and (maybe) to everyone -- I'll hang out with them again. I don't know how long it would last though, but if I can be comfortable enough, if I can be just myself, then yeah. It will just be the beginning! ;)  Petty.. if you're reading this, your journey has just begun, darling. ;) "Don't be sad because it's over, smile because it happened."

Missed the Phil K/Dave Seaman party last month. But that's OK. Plenty to come. This weekened we have 5am, Volume, and then Renaissance - Zabiela!!  FUCK. another hard weekend. hehehehehe :)  I'm so glad I've prepared well for this. I can kiss my room goodbye for 3 fucking days. well not really. I still got to come home after recoveries. Shower and stuff. Eat. Blog. Mail. Bickies..   Pana, Strangis, Reemo and Alby .. the usual dosage. Wanting to catch Citrus and Lanithium, see how they play..   Also have to find out about that warehouse party I hear ....  Anyway.. I'm off!!

         I went to see Troy. For a moment there I thought this movie is going to make a   cheesecake out of history. I was wrong. It made a Kraft factory out of it. To   the uninitiated, Troy may look as if it were taken from history books. It's   not. Basically, Troy took the best elements of Homer's "Illiad", re-work,    re-mix, re-edit, re-fuck it as they (the studio) see fit.      Blatant selling of Mr. Pitt physical prowess, actually.      But I must admit the swordplay looked pretty cool. The chick who played Helen   is also quite hot. Story-wise, it has no educational value, except that you   can get away with adultery as long as your dad and brother are politician and   military leader. And maybe a lesson to keep your firewall on at all times to   keep all the "Trojan" away.      Special effect and hollywood style plot alignment are as per usual, grand.   Greeks in skirts are not as bad as I thought. Rose Byrne is also quite hot.   At the end of the day, this movie made me want to do a search in google about   the facts of the real "Illiad". Not a bad motivational tool. Or maybe because   I'm a movie geek.      My Score: 3.25/5

         Ahh.. a cold winter night is at hand.     Flu has finally dispersed. feeling good. but cough remains (although only an artefact). Anyway, i got something to look forward to this weekend. Petty is back!!! Yay!    I've been trying to call M but apparently no answer. I wonder if she screened my call. Nevertheless, I feel bad about last Saturday. She left early and doesn't seem to enjoy it that much. Want to give her a buzz and take her to dinner or something. Maybe Volume this Sat?    It's going to be a good night when we have our health back, methinks ;)    anyway...    /me signing off... some crazy girls on MSN ;)

It does scared me a bit on how childlike innocence is now somehow muted or diminished or eradicated by what we experience as A FUCKING ADULT LIFE!     can't be helped. lets move on.     oh, and i just realised how cute Femmy was. didn't notice that in high school -- hehe :)    Saturday. Made the most of my day cleaning, washing, vacuuming, stacking, organizing SO FUCKING MANY MESSY STUFF in my room. I have fun actually (yeah since when you don't have fun eh?) Chatted with Jessie for a bit. Happy2 Joy2 until sundown.    then it happened.

         Wasn't feeling well today. It is inevitable. Sooner or later each and everyone of us will succumb to what would be otherwise called "The Winter Plague".    I have the fucking flu. FUCK.    The watery eyes I can take it, but the sneezing are beginning to spiral out of control. Argh. Took two hits of Codral at lunch and I'll take another two before bedtime. It wasn't all bad. I got a sickie for tomorrow. hehe.    can't go anywhere anyway. not in this condition.    aaargh.    /me signing off.

         Didn't write much over the weekend and yesterday. I guess I just spent all my time taking it easy. Came home and basically kick back, surf the net, watch some telly. Went to bed about 11. Not exactly a lot of fun, but comforting nonetheless.       Now, what should I do about this entry. Should I write about:      - Last weekend and the drama that follows.    - Case of a missing friend.    - A quiet Monday night.    - Some other totally unrelated subjects.      Um...      Let's see, last weekend and its dramas. Entertaining for me, distressing for some people, and maybe amusing for some others. But naah, ask me in person if you want to hear about what my weekend like ;)      Case of a missing friend. Well, there's no point crying over spilt milk, let alone a missing friend. I'm at that point in life when I can just accept people for who/what they are (actually since I turned 23). Including if they went AWOL for no apparent reason. Nevertheless, this topic is similar in nature of the events happening in the drama that occurs on sunday afternoon. (G&amp;M Project - Sunday Afternoon)      Quiet Monday night. I went home from work late and made stir-fry for dinner. A round of phonecalls just to check where everyone's at. Called Budi to say happy birthday. Eat. Check e-mail. Surf the web. Watch 24. Sleep. Wake up at 7. FUCK.      Totally unrelated subjects. Now i can talk about rubbish or I can talk about substance. substance? what substance? hehe. now, to think of it, I already typed enough text to be considered an entry worthy of posting. Not that the actual content is actually something of a matter of importance. hmm..       anyway...

         Yes Kids,     Another weekend is at hand. Tonight's destination: Room 680. Not really looking for a big night, honestly I am in for a bit of chinstroking. Haven't done my share of chin to be stroked for quite a bit of time, so...   See the usuals.   Been listening to Sander's 2004 Sensation White set. It's quite good. Looking forward to Godskitchen now.   FUCKiNG BORED.   /me off to make some tea.

        Yesterday was Airin's Birthday. To be honest, that was one of the most memorable birthday celebration/preparation I ever had. I haven't gone to a great deal length to prepare for somebody's birthday in a long while. It was good fun. I actually having fun running around doing stuff.    - Meeting Airin in the tram and trying my best not to give away her surprise!  - Smoking the new "Gudang Garam" tobacco + clover hybrid ciggie.  - Annoys one of the waiter in red silk for asking too many servings of chilli.  - Forcing Jono to get a card with Miss Piggy on it while we got the best ones.  - Delicately handling the boquette in the passenger seat while we struggle with seatbelts.  - Running away from a waiter bitch in a carlton cafe while she checked the price for us.  - Jono and I exercising our evil laugh to the discontentment of Ajeng & Jamie.  - Asking "what does cheesecake taste like?" and and got a reply "It taste like Cheese".  - Decided to get the biggest strawberry cheesecake ever in crown which would took lots of effort to eat.  - Jono &amp; I share a ciggie in the backseat while discussing the scene.  - Laughing at Jono forgetting his own girlfriend's mobile number.  - Laughing at Jamie, Jono and myself because we can't blow a fucking balloon.  - Laughing at Ajeng because she now had to blow all six of them.  - Laughing at Jono because he had to carry all six balloons.  - Burned my hand in the process of lighting all the candles up.  - Catching Budi with no pants when he opened the door.  - Getting myself lightheaded on Champagne.  - Spending $20 on mobile credits just for sending SMS to Petty.  - Went clubbing after all the above (and don't bother asking where we went)    It was fun! Airin, happy birthday darling! ;)

        So yeah.    I'm excited about nothing and everything. I wonder why.Called Lia last night to say happy birthday to her. 26. Wow.And I'm going to be one too this year. What does age mean anyway? Now I will give you a piece of my mind about age.    It doesn't mean jack, kids.    At least in my world anyway. Age is something I left behind in high school. Back then, seniority rules. If you're older, then you know better.    right? It's so fucking wrong.    A while ago I notice a thread on ITM which is discussing about how oldskool a DJ is. One in particular, claims that he listened to acid house at 6 and started going to raves at 11.    WTF?    When I was 6 I only listened to whatever my mom and dad chucked on my direction, and I had both my thumbs up my arse, going to playgroups singing along to Mickey Mouse on telly, and do fingerpainting instead of waving my glowsticks. (Maybe glowsticks are still popular in 1984.)    I reckon I'm oldskool.    hehehe.    But seriously, in my humble opinion, it doesn't matter if you're older -- how oldskool you are is determined on how enthusiastic you are, how passionate you are, and how much you appreciate tke knowlegde you've gained in every aspect of your life.    I'll be more enthusiastic talking to somebody who only have been going out for three months, but loving every minute of music he/she listened to. I'm keen to go out with somebody who is 5 years younger but knows his/her trance very well.    I'll be less inclined to hang out with someone who said "been there, done that" with nothing more than a smirk on their face and bagging every piece of music not made with a 303/808/909 (Ajeng if you don't know what a 303/808/909 is -- again, please read Ishkur's Guide to EDM hehe :) I know you only read pictures but .. :P).    I will not have a pleasant conversation with someone who wants to act older than they actually are, or acting their age as if they going to take their pension fund out in three months.    being old is not funny, kids.    arthritis, alzheimer, bowel cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, breast cancer, rhemumatic, catharact, hair loss, impotency.    uh. I scared myself a bit there (approximately 4.29817491 seconds). hehe :P    anyway, it's only a state of mind. who you are can't be determined by numbers. It's only one, two or three digits anyway, we've not even reached 1/billionth the age of our universe yet. (I say our universe because I kind of believe the multiverse -- multiple universe theory introduced by Hawking et al. , but that's a different post altogether hehe ;P)    so work/study hard and party harder, kids. what else you got to do when you're young?    - $0.02 cents from a 25 y.o. trapped inside the body of a 20 y.o.

        Meh. Another drama ALMOST happened today. For a minute there I thought Jamie going to be furious over my post. Thank God that didn't happened. This is not the first time somebody got offended by my blog.     Maybe this time it's age/gender that prevents the dramas from being happen. I'm just glad it doesn't escalate further.    me and my big fucking mouth.     when a similar drama happened two years ago happened, I lost a good friend, and a good listener. but the good thing is she got over herself (maybe) -- and I didn't beg for forgiveness either. But we're not as close as we used to.    funny how things turns out to be.    On another note Ajeng joined gmail. Yay! Jamie still hasn't got his invite, (Jamie if you're reading this I haven't got any invites yet :P) -- I sent heaps of request to blogger.com users but nothing came up so far!

       I think tonight I can release the blogs to the outside world. Caveats:  - Most of 2003/First half of '04 blogs are still missing - the database dump from the old pages are scattered. (much like the state of my brain every weekend during that period hehe :P)  - New Links/Desc need to be posted to the sidebar - and republished. - Still have to decide wheter to include orkut or friendster.  But yeah. I still need to do some things, then it's time.  In the meantime, where's that CD? and an amusement to keep you occupied :  urlLink Electronic Musical Instrument 1870 - 1990

       Hehe.  It's sunday morning. I 've been listening to Chris' CD for the past hour. It's good. It's .. REALLY good. I like the tracks. My kind of techtrancer. Hence this blog title. ;) What a wicked night GTR was. Lots of excellent tracks being played. And spending a quiet saturday night at home was one of the best recoveries ever. In fact, I don't have bad recoveries for quite some time. Hehe. :)  In the meantime, I've been waiting for my brunch to get ready. hehe.   Met Femmy this afternoon with Japra. It was nice actually. I didn't realise she and her boyfriend was really cool people. :) Really looking forward to hanging out together! ;)  As for this sunday.. it's really an easy weekend.. two days of excellent recoveries.  wanting more days like these three days ....

       OK,   Complementary post before signing off work today. Wanting to go home early to prepare. Big night, tonight, hehe ;) Ahh.. not much to do this Friday. Importing blogs was one thing to finish during weekend. Hopefully I can get it done before it got too much out of hand. Can you believe how much text I generated in almost 2 years?  Hopefully I can freeze the database and start writing blogs directly at blogger.com by Sunday night. Or Monday. The longer the delay, the more text I have to import from and into. Ahh.. I just realised I had everything Google.  GMail by Google. Orkut by Google. Blogger by Google.  Should I put Google-addict in my "Occupation" field on Friendster now?  /me signing off.

       So I finally ended the ER season for '04. Was it a good conclusion? Tying up loose ends? Everybody happy? Not exactly. It is a good conclusion in a sense that left us wanting for the new season. Loose ends? More like it left us with a whole new thread. As of everybody happy? At least Abby is.  Still a bit dissapointed about missing Alias finale. Damn. Better wait for the DVD I guess.  On another note, I've been trawling Friendster and Orkut .. Orkut is slower than Friendster but has plenty of other capabilities not exist in Friendster. I wonder if google would buy friendster and incorporate Orkut's features. Let's invite everyone to orkut in the morning and see what happens.  Hmmm..  still searching for that coveted Gmail invite. GTR is tomorrow. yay!  /me better sleep now.

       Doing my laundry tonight. What a boring job this is. Doing chores is one of the things that you can get away with when you're single and living with another male which is not gay. Otherwise we'll be in all sort of hell. I wonder if I should do two loads. It's already 10pm and I'm cbf to fiddle with more clothing article for the night. Naah.. leave it for the weekend.. No, the week after. hehe :P  At least I got to listen to washing machine music ;)  I need PvD sensation white set to restore my faith in him!!! ;)  FUCK I need broadband.

       It's Monday AGAIN, kids.  FUCK.  I guess I shouldn't complain about monday sickness, afterall, I got something to look forward to this weekend. GTR! That's right, yet another presentation of 5am crew of a marvelous trance treats.   But still...  FUCK.  I hate mondays. Actually, not really. I hate mondays when it's cold, wet and somebody ate all the toasts in the office.  I want my fridays back.  Oh, yeah, FUCK America too with their "I don't give a fuck" 4th of July celebration! What inspires australian TV to even cover it is beyond me. As if they will cover Indonesian Independence Day.

       It's a Sunday night at home writing blogs and watching telly. I can't believe I almost slept throughout the entire day. It's now 11pm and there's not much else to do tonight.  Except household chores, that is.  So Jamie made Ajeng cried this morning when we got home from NextBlue. Jamie's a good guy but sometimes I'm not very fond about the way he joked, plus maybe his sensitivity. But I don't like how he made ajeng cried. Maybe he didn't do it on purpose, but I don't like to see somebody offended by it to the point where she actually feel the joke was for real.  I don't get easily offended.  But I'm offended by anyone who purposedly/unpurposedly hurt the feeling of anybody I care about.  Let's hope everything's alright. This also, shall pass.

       Let's face it.  Having good friends means that you can get excited about weekends, but ir can also mean that you have to swallow your pride (and your elitistism) if it means that you can have a very small chance of hitting it off with someone.   I will going out tonight. Not to a trance/prog/breaks night.   I don't know what's wrong with myself.

       So she's gone now, and wouldn't be back for a month or so. So we've been hanging out together for like three weeks, but i've grown fond of her.  It's funny.  Can't describe it, but I can't wait till she got back. ;)  Maybe a five-track will help soothe it:  Everything But The Girl - Missing (Shootie's Booty Mix) Mind-X vs. Trance Angels - Come Back (Woody Van Eyden Dub) Armin van Buuren Feat. Justine Suissa - Burned With Desire (Rising Star Dub) Discovery - Missing (Gleave & Johnston Remix) Coast 2 Coast - Searching (Coast 2 Coast Remix)  and maybe:  John Creamer & Stephane K - Wish You Were Here (Lexicon Avenue Dub)

         FUCK. This is the fucking last straw. This cunt is finally going to get it the next time I see him. I mean, hurting, disowning, abandoning, lying, two-timing oversensitive bastard that he is, after all this time that I believe of the goodness in people, one day he just show up and fucked my friends over. As far as I'm concern, he's not my friend anymore, I don't care what happened to him, I don't want to see him, I don't want him to go fucking near any of my friends ever again. And if he's still trying to get close to Petty I fucking swear I'm going to fucking bash this cunt.      Need music to soothe it, methinks.      Strange. don't seem recall anything that will soothe anger. Or maybe because i haven't feel so fucking angry in a long while. Hmm. I guess PvD will do for now. ;)      2 days now I spent in Jono's place. It's OK. It's nice. It's got an awesome view. Nice. Anyway. I only just started again with this post since this morning, so I lost track of what i really want to write. I think i'll just keep writing nonsense until an idea comes up.      OK, slow start of the week, but never boring. Jono's place are actually quite comfy when the heater is on. I just hope the electricity bill will not skyrocketed. FUCK we had the heater turned on for the entire night. watched fahrenheit 9/11 half-heartedly.      message party.      what am I going to do now.      maybe some trance.....

         Well, now that was a weekend well spent! I'm still a bit tired after all that excitement, but it will all sit down nicely tonight I guess. Sleeping pattern has little difference than any other week, with the same coffee/food intake.  But I do cut down the drinking.      Friday: Slept 6 to 9 , 4 to 6 = 5 hrs.    Saturday: Slept 7 to 11 = 4hrs.    Sunday: Slept 1 to 7 = 6hrs.      in ballpark.. Heineken, Vodka Redbull, JW & Coke, Chivas, Heineken, 2004 Merlot.      That's about it.      Volume was fun. the full two hours of it. Seeing Airin & Petty got hit by a random every five minutes was gold. Maybe it's the fashion factor. hehe. Was a bit gutted had to leave early, but I had fun nevertheless. Nice to hear Bedrock - Heaven Scent and Satoshi Tomiie - Love in Traffic again. Steve &amp; Chris are rocking it as usual - White Room, Escape, Solarcoaster, and seeing the floor was still packed at 5.30 was a proven fact that Volume has become a saturday night institution in melbourne.      so what are we going to do today?      2 weekend away from the full moon Transcend/5am. Argh. Cant wait!! It's going to be massive!! ;) Need to get proper kits for the night though. Party calendar is starting to fill itself in now, it brings shivers just by thinking of it.      I think I'm going off the track here.      The whole purpose of this post is to review the weekend past. Honestly, I was happy with it, it's me, airin, petty and budi all weekend. It was so different with my weekends with jamie & ajeng last month. Sure we had fun as well, but.. something feels different. It has positive vibes, good laugh, memorable moments, but not as... probably because it's the comfort factor and the music factor. Let's do case studies:      - A & P can relatively wake up early.    - A & P share the same appreciation towards EDM    - A & P cbf about insecurities all the time.    - A & P are hardcore!!      Anyway, the important thing with them is, yes means yes, and no can be negotiated. Really looking forward to this weekend!!! ;)      my rating 5/5 ;)
