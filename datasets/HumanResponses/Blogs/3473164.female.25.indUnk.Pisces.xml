      So, I got a little serious yesterday, and part of me wants to apologize-- probably the same part of me that is scared sometimes-- but I am not going to apologize.  Apologies, fear, and lack of faith in the individual are to be avoided.  Well, not all apologies, but... apologies for being serious and committed and a visionary.  You shouldn't apologize for that.  So there.  Just  urlLink breathe .    Today is my last day selling  urlLink MINI Coopers  for a baseball legend.  I never thought I would sell cars, and I never thought I would work for Hank Aaron, but now I have done both.  Life has a funny way.    Selling cars has taught me a good bit, including how to drive a manual, which makes me feel more competent as a human.  I have been driving a MINI, and now I have to give it back, which makes me sad.  My  urlLink real car  doesn't have airbags or a CD player and only the left-side speakers work, so I will be unsafe and without good tunes.  Here are some heroine hints to buying a new car: 1.  Say no to dealer prep fees, bank fees, and generally any other fee that is not included on the Munroney Label, the official label from the manufacturer that by law must be displayed in new cars.  These fees can be negotiated.  Now, most dealers do have a documentation fee, and here at MINI we never waive it, but there might be some negotiation at other dealerships. 2.  There is generally flexibility in the finance rate that an auto dealer offers you, so even negotiate your interest rate if possible.  Car dealerships want your finance business and will generally do what they can to gain your finance business.   3.  Be sure to thoroughly inspect your car when it is delivered.  Look for dings, scratches, etc.  This is not to say that they will be hidden from you, but sometimes even a dealership will overlook something, and it is better to take care of it before you leave.   4.  Do your internet research.   urlLink Edmunds  is a good place to start.   5.  Look at several dealerships.  Comparison shopping works well in the car business.   6.  Be nice.  Remember that car sales people are people too with families to feed, or in my case a cat, and for the most part they are just trying to earn their keep.  Most work on 100% commission.  7.  Buy a  urlLink MINI  or  urlLink Scion XB .  Maybe that will be of some help to someone, even though I don't think anyone is really reading my blog.  Which leads me to ponder how does one force people to read their blog?  Okay, well maybe forcing isn't really the right verb, encourage, how does one encourage.    I am feeling a bit nervous about being unemployed.  I will officially be part of that faceless 5.6%, but I will go voluntarily.  I was supposed to talk about Israel today, but I am busy trying to figure out how I am going to celebrate my last day at work.  Figures, doesn't it?    Maybe I'll  urlLink krump .  Watch a  urlLink movie .

      Peace concerns me because I do not think that people should blow-up, shoot, maim or otherwise hurt each other if they are in search for solutions.  Death is not a solution; it is a sentence.  And, no one has ever been able to explain to me how violence solves problems.    The obvious answer:  "Violence solves problems by killing everyone who is a problem and scaring everyone else who is thinking about becoming a problem."  Interesting proposal, but it has never and will never work because there is always someone who is above fear, someone who is willing to die, someone who doesn't give a poot, and someone who fills deeply wounded by previous violence and therefore someone who seeks retribution.  Hasn't anyone watched "The Godfather"?  Violence begets violence.  What are we supposed to do?  Sit around and wait to be attacked?  Well, here is an idea I have been kicking around.  Attack and death are inevitable as there will always be someone who does not value life. There are two answers to this sad reality.    One:  Go out and try to kill everyone who might try to kill us first.  Problem:  In the process of trying to kill all of the evil-doers, we kill some innocents, and these innocents have friends and families.  They are people that do not believe in violence and probably would have never taken up arms IF their loved one had not suffered needlessly.  After the death of their loved one, they become filled with anger and seek retribution creating a new threat that we (of course) must confront.  We (being America) send over our guys and gals in the army, and they heroically fight for our freedom.  Another group of innocents lose their lives (albeit voluntarily) and back home loved ones blame the faceless enemy.  Where does this cycle end?    The cycle breeds more violence than the status quo.  Regardless of what happens, there will be people who hate and people who kill, but meeting their violence with more violence does nothing to prevent these people from existing and actually increases violence because it transforms non-violent individuals into fighters.  Result:  We have the violent status-quo plus the violence we have bred with violence.    Net loss  Two:  Do what we can to prevent violence through non-violent means and educate.  Problem:  The argument goes that there are people out there who hate us and will stop at nothing to ruin our way of life.  They do not care if you are Democrat or Republican, peaceful or hateful; they want us all dead.  I grant that.  I concede that these people exist, but they will always exist regardless of what we do, and if there is any chance of changing them or making sure that their beliefs are not passed-on that chance does not lie in blowing up their countries and killing their citizens.  Such violence only supports their belief that we are dangerous, hateful people who need to be stopped.  Attacks provide fuel for their fire of hate.  Attacks win new recruits, recruits that previously were on the fence or did not want to be involved in the violence at all.    People say that war is the price of freedom; the death of a soldier is the price of freedom.  That I live in an ivory tower and take my freedom for granted while the sons and daughters of America sacrifice their lives for me.  And I say, wait one minute.    If I could bring back every soldier that is overseas, I would.  I do not want them there.  I do not believe they should die for my freedom.  I would rather take the risk of dying here because they were not there than have them assume the risk of dying there.  Simply:  I would rather die here at the hands of a terrorist because my country adopted a policy of non-violence than to selfishly demand the sacrifice of others.  I will die for my freedom, but I will not seek my death and I will not ask that others die for me.  Violence is not the American way.  We do not condone violence in lieu of the democratic process.  We do not condone gang warfare.  We do not condone preemptive strikes.  If we did, we would live in a "Minority Report" inspired landscape where people who were prone to commit crimes would be locked up.  Don't we believe in innocent until proven guilty?  So, how can we say that we are fighting for the American way?    Ahhhh.  I am tired.  There is more.  There is always more.  I didn't even get to the part about Bush and Israel or about education.  I was watching  urlLink "The Dennis Miller"  show last night (What kind of website is that anyways?  It isn't even a website.), and a member of the panel said one reason he is voting for Bush is because he has been the most Israel-friendly president in recent history. Israel, another interesting topic when it comes to peace and the American way.        I wish I had some links for my thoughts.  It looks more exciting when there are  urlLink colors .                     Maybe, tomorrow.  Hopefully, forever.

      There is this little part of me that wants to post a blank blog and that little part is fear.  Posting my thoughts, my ponderings, and rants seems a little presumptuous.  The act assumes that there will be a reader, and I am not really sure who would want to read.  Then, there is the other part that screams to be heard and demands she will be read.  I recently read an article about " urlLink Blog Lit " and I was left thinking, "Well, why not?," which seems to be my latest approach to life.  At the age of 25, I am planted firmly in a "quarter-life" crisis.  The title again presumptuous as who is to assume that they will live to 100, but I did not create the label, but the category has created a new market segment.  And the segment has  urlLink a book, a website, and now a conference  .  So, the quarter-life crisis.  I haven't read the official diagnosis, but for me it means floundering about searching for a passion, scared that my life will end without accomplishment, working half-heartedly at jobs I feel are meaningless, and beating myself up for not being the 25 year-olds who organize  urlLink Bonnaroo  or the 15-year old who started her own internet consulting firm.  (Her name is  urlLink Laima Tazmin .)  Obviously, if greatness hasn't found me, then I am not meant for greatness.  That is what my quarter-life crisis dictates.  I have quit my job as a Motoring Advisor, aka MINI Cooper Salesperson, after quitting my jobs as an investment banking analyst for Lehman Brothers, a waitress for the Atlanta Fish Market, and a nanny for an unnamed family in Buckhead.  Perhaps my greatness is my ability to quit.  Somehow I don't believe that will garner great accolades in Horatio Alger's homeland.     But, I am here, and I too need to be heard, or perhaps I just need to be written.  And so it begins, the ponderings of a self-proclaimed heroine who worries about world peace, the rise of women, the fall of children, and how one becomes a Top 40 rock star.
