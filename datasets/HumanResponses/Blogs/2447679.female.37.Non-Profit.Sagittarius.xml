      The last day of the year.  And I am spending it alone...not necessarily a bad thing.  Had a few invitations from my friends to go here or there, but its not the same as going out with a date...so I am staying home, alone.  New Years is a time for getting dressed up to go out, kissing someone special at midnight, drinking until dawn, breakfast at some diner...well, since I am alone this year, I am not partaking and will be spending it watching movies, eating some favorite snacks, and talking to other people who are "alone" on New Years.    What are my hopes for 2004?    - that my one and only child graduates from high school in June - that said child begins university or some other meaningful venture this September - that I move out of Port Hawkesbury, the zone of nothingness thrown at the side of the highway - that I am lucky enough to get another job when I leave the zone - that the resident teen and I return safely from our next adventure - Mexico and Central America in April - that I figure out what the hell I am doing with my life once said child moves out - that my sister safely delivers her THIRD child in June (and that it is a girl!) - that I am not alone next New Years Eve  We'll just have to wait and see how the year goes...

      All that fuss over Christmas and its all but over!  Was a wonderful time though...Christmas Day the resident teenager jumped on my bed at 5:15am...thought she had outgrown that, but apparently NOT.  So ma dragged her ass out of bed to open stockings, then head downstairs for the gift opening.  Lots of lovely gifts and the resident teenager was pleased with her new larger backpack I gave her for our travels.  Then I headed back to bed to SLEEP!  About 10:30, aroused again by teenager, we got ourselves ready, picked up her b/f and headed to Sydney to see her sister and family.  The little one is gorgeous!  Brooklynn turned 2 on Monday, and she talks up a storm.  She's a real sweetie and if I had stayed married to her grandfather, I would have been a grandma...YIKES!  Good thing I got divorced, I am too young to be a grandma....give me a few more years yet...  So, hairy ride back in the rain, fog and sleet...then we set off for my friend Kathleen's to eat and drink.  Good having that resident teenager around when you need a designated driver!!!  After food and sloth, back home again to chat and get to bed...busy days coming...  Boxing day was all about cleanup and a short visit from my brother and his daughter.  We exchanged gifts and everyone was pleased, then Olivia discovered the chocolate and it went down hill from there.  They are heading to the rock to spend some time with my parents, so off they went, and back to cleaning up for us.  Amber then headed to work for the night and I went to bed early.  Saturday...brave the malls, not too bad...lineups acceptable...get in and out with what I need and off to a friend's house for the afternoon with friend Kara.  We had a pleasant visit out of town, then back here again to feed and sloth before heading out to the 9th annual Snowbowl!  No gals allowed to play...just fine with me...we all hung out inside and drank, ate and smoked...it was great!  I did go out to watch from time to time, and saw one touchdown, so that was cool.  Back home again at 1:30am, for SLEEP.  Yesterday, it was a girls day...food, sloth, movies, drinks, laughter, crafts - knitting and cross stitch that day; and a great time...Finding Nemo was HILARIOUS!  Gotta love Ellen, huh?  We also watched A Beautiful Mind, Pirates of the Carribean, and Notting Hill.    Today is much easier...some shopping (mall was a zoo) and home for sloth, drinks, food, and movies...and more knitting!  I bought some Feather Boa "yarn" and am making a fuzzy scarf.    So there you go...now the week ahead has more social outings, but for a couple of days, its all about me...har har...

      Here I sit, all shopped out.  I have bought the very last thing I am going to buy for Christmas.  Absolutely.  I have the turkey dinner and all the trimmings, all the gifts and stocking stuffer...oh crap...what about the booze...have to go to the liquor store!  But that's usually not as busy as the ZOO Wal-mart was tonight!  Gazooks, they must make a killing this time of year.  I nearly got smoked by a car today...I had looked left and right before pulling into the intersection to cross the highway and WHATTHEHELL out of nowhere, there was a car in front of me, going across...she must have pulled out of the Credit Union parking lot after I looked right...that intersection sees lots of accidents, as they really need a signal light.  I just hope I am not in one there...I saw my life flash for a second or two!    the weather channels says no snow for Christmas it seems...WHOO HOOO!  I used to care about that before but after last winter's shovelling extravaganza...I couldn't care less.  Green Christmas...so what.  We might even have rain.  At least I don't have to shovel rain.  I have a splitting headache today, and still do that mysteriously appeared after spending an hour in the same car as a certain co-worker of mine.  Wonder what the connection is    So, in light of said headache, I think I shall retire early tonight.

      apparently there wasn't much to say later...   a friend dropped over with some flowers and a birthday cake...awwww....how sweet.  I haven't had a cake in years and I love to get flowers, so it was grand.  Then we made Kraft dinner and went to Canadian Tire.  But earlier in the day, the resident teenager took me to Gabrieau's Bistro for some GOOD food...highly recommend the ciabatta melts.  We did some shopping after that at the mall, and then came home.    The highlight came when my brother called, actually on my birthday!  His usual pattern is to call me either the day before or the day after, or not at all.  This year he got it right, and was very nice on the phone...I was happy.  It might seem like a little thing, but to me it is a big thing.  My brother only calls me once or twice a year, and one of those is the birthday call.  And I only have one brother.  So my sister called too, and while she didn't have much time to chat, she did have good news...she passed her courses for her Paramedic Level 1 courses and is now a qualified Paramedic...Whoo hoo!  I'm so proud of her.  She has two toddlers at home and is pregnant with her third and still managed to pull this off.  What a gal.  And my friend Susan called, and we both talked about how lonesome and boring our lives are, except for the snow and out lack of money...I try not to think about how sad that is.  But I was very glad to her from her and have someone to commiserate with!  the odd thing is, she too lived in the void here in Port Hawkesbury at one point in her life!  Of course my mother called too, and we chatted.  I spoke for about 10 seconds to my dad.  Sometimes he is a regular chatty cathy while other times he barely walks by the phone while speaking, ha ha.  I guess he has to be in the mood!  No snow here in Cape Breton...good thing.

      Gadzooks!  How can it be Thursday already?  I haven't written since Sunday.  Well, here's the abbreviated version...no new snow, lots of rain.  I've shopped my butt off for Christmas sponsorship kids this month and loved every minute of it.  16 kids, all with other people's money...awesome!  I just love the feeling I get when I get to be Santa and drop the presents off...two more stops tomorrow and I'm done...then I have to focus on my stuff.  So I had the bright idea to "make" most of my Christmas presents this year...yahoo...I'm so creative...except now I have to actually get it done.  I did manage to get most things done for the kidlets, aka my neice and two nephews...I made them cd's and tapes of me reading stories to them, and little aprons for in the kitchen.  But then there is the barbie doll clothes I was supposed to make for my neice...still in pieces on the floor of my dining room...and there is the cookbook for my daughter, still half typed in my computer...and the scrapbook of our trip to Europe for my daughter...only 3 pages done...and all the mittens for my neice I promised her...sigh...I'm tired just thinking about it.  Whose bright idear was this anyhow?  So now I feel like I have to go buy something to put with the cd/tape combo for my neice as she got her apron months ago, and the barbie clothes and mittens just ain't gonna happen in time.  Rats, there goes my plan to make all my gifts.  It's my dad's 69th birthday today.  Holy cow...when did my dad get so old?  And then I remember that tomorrow is my birthday...37 years old...even though the sassy ladies at work kept trying to make me out to be 40!!!  Perish the thought...I don't think I can handle being 40 and alone...I will have to find someone by then.  Ok, that is depressing enough...tomorrow will be a great day.  My daughter is taking me out to a fancy restaurant for an early supper in Antigonish...Gabrieau's Bistro...yumm!  And tonight, a friend dropped by with a gift bag for my birthday... knowing how much I just LOVE snow...she bought me a teddy bear that sings "Let it Snow"...my friends are sadistic, and out to get me...she said she knew I would love it as soon as she saw it.  It will sit on my desk when I get back to work on Monday....it will balance off the sign on my door that says "Snow makes me cranky, what do YOU want?"  which was better than the first draft..."snow makes me cranky - f*** off".  but I got in trouble at work for cursing about the snow in the hallway, so scratched that.  don't forget to check out my friend Shane's blog...he has been BUSY this week!    urlLink Hairy Hoser

      It is snowing out again....  But not to worry, I have my trusty snow shoveller, Brad.    The great tree excursion of 2003 is over, we've scored a tree.  It looks great and now that it and the house is decorated, the work is done...NOT!  I still have baking to do - hope the hell it doesn't turn out like last time; and more presents to wrap and one more to shop for...she really has me puzzled and she reads so much meaning into things, I have to be SURE with her gift :-)  The staff Christmas party was on Friday and Santa (yours truly) was a hit.  I was also on call and couldn't drink,  so Santa was a little less jolly than he could have been.  However, he did trip over the mike of the lead singer in the band we hired and sent it rocketing into the guy's head as he was singing...OOOPS!  He just kept on singing...what a professional!  The band was very good, and at the end, my friend Rob sang a couple of songs too.    I tried to get everyone to sit on Santa's knee, but not everyone was so keen on that...heh heh...if you want to see a pic of Santa...just check out my online photo album here:   urlLink Jude's Photo Albums   Well, I have to go pick up the resident teenager who was supposed to be drinking responsibly last night.  Good time to sing Christmas carols in her ear to see if it hurts...heh heh

      wahhh, my guy was voted off survivor tonight!  What a jerk he turned out to be anyhow.  "Lil, I hope you can live with yourself.  You broke our alliance" he says as he just finished writing her name down...duh.  Well, there goes another 10 bucks down the drain.  Nothing like losing twice...just don't think I'm paying twice!  I saw someone elses life flash before them today as they cut off two lanes of traffic that had an 18 wheeler and a pick-up truck in them in order to make a left turn...This guy pulled out in front of this traffic from a parking lot and crossed both lanes, pulling into the lane ahead of me...I damn near crapped myself.  If he had stalled...it would have been over for a few of us tangled up in his mess.  I can't think of anything else that peeves me more than irresponsible driving!  And now that I have been living in small town Cape Breton for going on 2 years now, I can't believe what I see.  I felt safer driving on the 401 in Ontario than I do here, if you can believe that.  I have never seen such driving.  Its like they handed out driver's licenses at Wal-mart to the first 200 shoppers.  I was beginning to question my own recollection of the rules of the road, until I looked them up and saw that, yes...you do all stop when the traffic lights are out and proceed as a four way stop....not here in Port Hawkesbury though...they sail right through....its a wonder no one is killed here.  Still no new snow, and I hear rain is on the way...I can only hope.  Although I now have a built in weekday shoveller...the b/f of the resident teenager spends the night in the guest room after he gets off work at 3am  (he has to be at college across the street at 7:30am and lives a 2 hour walk away and can't get a ride at 3am).  He has offered to shovel any and all snow that falls this winter when he can.  Awwwww...what a sweetie.  And yes, he is sleeping in the guest room...there are no conjugal visits and I know this because of the beaded curtain on the door of resident teenager that hangs in front of wooden door...built in door CLACKER and mother is a light sleeper    Workplace Christmas party tomorrow night...good thing I am on call or I might get intoxicated and make an ass of myself...more to come

      a good day...I was an agent of change, a presenter, a mom, and a good friend today.  I don't think I get enough days like this one, so I'm going to savour it well.  All I can say is that for today, opening my mouth was a good thing.  This is not always the case.  :-)  Good news on the snow/ice in the driveway - the b/f of the resident teen managed to hack and chop it all out and I can park in the driveway again...whoo hoo!!!  Bad news is, when I got home, I realized that the garbage truck did not notice my white bag of garbage on the snow/ice pile in the driveway and it was still there when I got home, much to the delight of the crows who decided it was snacktime...bad crows!!!  Got the bank card back again this morning, and had it replaced with a brand new one.  When they went to fetch mine, there were what looked like 6 or 7 others in her hand from the machine...aha...I was not the only one who was pissed last night...  I explained to the resident teenager what a blog was, and since she aspires to be a journalist someday, she is interested in beginning her own...stay tuned for a site addy.

      another fine day in my life.  I got the resident teen to drop me off to do some shopping while she took the car and friend to do her own shopping.  call me when you need a drive home, says she.   I begin at the drug store, get the required stocking stuffers and move on to deposit my cheque next door at the bank.  in goes the cheque, out comes the money...or at least that's how its supposed to work...just before my money comes out...the machine goes blank, and shuts down.  with my card.  with my money.  and with me not having really begun the night's shopfest.  I pound, kick and scream, to no avail.  It doesn't care.  It has my card and money and is laughing at me.  Then the machine reboots and tells me to "please insert your card".  Another string of expletives.  I call the posted number, and get mr puberty on the phone who tells me...wow, I never heard of that before...you mean, like, your card didn't come out?    yeah, whatever, piss off is what is in my mind.  Then he tells me he can't do anything about it, go see the bank in the morning (the bank machine is right on the bank property).  Fine, but that doesn't help me now, and please tell me no one else can get my money spit out at them when they use the machine.  No, no, of course not.  Yeah, right, buddy.  we'll see.  So then I phone resident teenager to pick me up.  Her phone isn't working.  So I phone the friend.  Her phone is not with her.  So I phone the friend's parents...yes, the girls were here but are gone now.  Gee, thanks.  Now I have to walk home...and I am not dressed for it.  So graciously, friend's-mother's-boyfriend came over and took me home.    I get home and the phone rings...it is the resident teenager calling from my friend's cell phone...hey, do you need a ride home?  piss off is what is in my mind.  but I did get some nice stocking stuffers at the drug store...

      so I tried to clear the snow.  it didn't go well.  my yard is now littered with various and assorted snow clearing paraphenelia...I have a huge chunk of ice at the end of my driveway that I cannot clear.  I have tried salt, chopping, and swearing.  So I went to the municipal offices and lodged a complaint about the snowplow driver.  my neighbor across the street has only a little wrinkle in his driveway...I have a 3 foot blob.  its not what you know but who you know.  So the snowclearing dispatched called me back at noon, but I was out.  I hope they call again, I have a few words to share.  there is slush and water everywhere, so I ended up walking to work in this slop and because I am too stubborn to buy new winter boots, I wore my sneakers and my feet of course, got soaked, along with my pantlegs.  snowclearing the sidewalks is apparently a foreign concept in this little town.  We'll do it when we get around to it, and if we don't, so what.  And sometimes we will even place a huge pile of snow in the middle of the sidewalk (last year).  My friend Shane apparently hates snowballs...especially the e-mail ones...so do I.  I've already been sent two, even though most people know not to send that crap to me.  Its like all those friendship day things.  I mean, come one, it has been national friendship day for the last 7 years...give it a rest already.  I don't want to see any twinkling angels, cherubs, fuzzy bears, blah, blah, blah.  If I am your friend, fine.  Let's leave it at that.  That goes for the good luck leprechauns, blue men matras, sob stories about sick children, and all that other forward crap too.  The only thing I want to see from my friends besides a pleasant e-mail is a funny joke or picture.  I don't care if something bad will happen to me in 7 days...  ok, enough ranting...I'm going to see whats on the boob tube...

      ok, Monday morning.  We all hate it.  try having the student loan people call you at 8:30am on the first morning you have off in weeks.  that's a drag.  I don't know who else is going through student loan hell, but I sure am.  They want my blood.  They call and threaten me weekly, and crying on them doesn't help...then they yell at me "ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO ME!!!" - no, says I, and hang up.    I feel like picketing outside the student awards office - DON'T GO FOR STUDENT LOANS!  IT IS HELL!!!  Sure, it got me out of the pinch I was in when I was a student, but I would trade it all back to not have them on my ass.  What they don't realize is that not everyone graduates with an engineering degree and makes $100k the first year.  Some actually get their degree to make a difference in the world and are not financially rewarded for that at $34K a year.  I think they target Arts grads, as they know darn well we don't make enough to make all the payments.    what to do, what to do.    and the snow...there is more of course, but it could have been worse...got mostly rain after the first 6 inches, so now I just have frozen lead to move from my driveway.  I'll likely break all four shovels, including my new scoop.  Now that I AM UP I might as well go give it a shot.  got some reserve anger now after talking to the student loan thugs, so lets feel the burn!

      Christmas baking.  35 cookies go into the oven.  10 survived.  what happened?  upon taking the lightly browned shortbreads out of the oven, the large cookie sheet hooked in the top wall of the oven and dumped the pan...only 10 made it out alive.  shortbread is very crumbly...and burns FAST on the element.  Now my nice Christmas baking smell has gone to BURNT cookie smell.  bah humbug.  I wish it was June.

      Saturday morning...phone call at 7am from my only sister who lives in northern BC - "I can't sleep.  wanna play cards".  mphmmhmmpphhh...huh?  so I got up, as I always do for my nocturnal baby sister, and off we go to Yahoo games where she kicks my butt.  30 minutes later, out rises the resident teenager, getting ready for work.  Then begin the "needs".  I need breakfast, I need a drive to work.  This from the teenager who three weeks ago, was looking for her own apartment.  Get something at work, I say (A & W) if you are too lazy to make your own breakfast.  We have gone way past where I suggest what she could have as it is the endless game of "I don't want that.  you know I don't like that, whah, whah , whah".  Then comes time to go shovel the snow that fell last night...and this charming child says to her mother "you shovel it, its your car".  Steam rises, deep breath...whooah...I'm sorry dear, then mother does not feel like driving you to work.  Get your thumb ready.  Hiss.  Let me show you how to use the new scoop mother bought two days ago.  hiss.  "I don't have anything to wear".  deep breath.  I show her the windpants I bought for her last year at Wal-mart to do this very task.  Its no wonder she doesn't remember them.  She only shovelled once or twice.  poor thing.  Here you go, dear.  Face as long as the day is short...but she knows by now that mother does indeed own the car, and without it, she will find herself standing on the side of the road with her thumb while being engulfed in slush from the dozens of trucks on the highway.    Resident teen manages to clean off the car in the time that I clear the driveway.  Not too bad today, better than two days ago, but I'm no fool...more to come tonight.  Now the scoop develops an attitude.  it was an expensive one with an adjustable handle...too bad it adjusts when it feels like it and not when I want it to.  then out it pops...mother has a tantrum in the driveway and the scoop goes flying.  Resident teen thought she was borrowing the car to drive to work...mother informs her NOT so because I have to take the scoop back to crappy tire.    and we're off.    I did get the scoop exchanged for one that has a stationary handle.  Good.  bring on the snow.

      ok, enough with the snow already...I am selling my car.  Has anyone seen the weather channel tonight?  There is a massive monster storm coming to get me.  (well, its actually coming to get a lot of people, but lets not split snow shovels)  Why am I living here in snow country?  I thought it would be nice to live closer to family again...is it my fault they bred in snow country?  In any case, I fear it will be a long and trying winter.  folks at work have learned this about me already...I have a sign on my door that says "snow makes me cranky.  what do you want?"  I had a few other comments to add there as well, but it is a workplace, after all.  Lets save that for my front door.  it can go right next to the one telling religious peddlers not to knock on my door.  msn messenger is great...my mother and her friend have decided to torture me by changing their msn ids to "I love snow" and "'tis snowing".  as if I didn't think about snow enough.  off to bed to the sound of the plow driver plotting against me...

      good morning.  my hand is in cramps and sore from all the shovelling I did last night.  luckily there is nothing new, or I don't think I could go out today.  I hear rain is on the way...not too soon. got the day off, whooo hooo!  but work that didn't get done yesterday because of weather now has me worried that I should get in there today.  booooo. off to the next town later this morning to see the doc.  that's always fun...hope there isn't a long wait.  I am too tired to even write much this morning.  yawn!

      its late, and I have just created my first ever blog.  can I just say that I hate winter already and it is not even here yet (although the snowdrift in my driveway would suggest otherwise).  All I know is my shoulder is hurting like I've been sqeezed by a sumo wrestler, and there is still snow to be shovelled.  that's it, todays entry is pitiful.  I promise to get better!

      well, another day, another snowfall.  I'm heading to Cheticamp today, lets see how much snow they have.  Could prove to be interesting if it gets snowy...I still haven't bought my snow tires yet...I was waiting to see how the winter went....  My child is sleeping in this morning...the first of many such mornings as she has completed high school.  How did this happen?  my stomach flutters at the thoughts of her leaving home, as finishing high school brings her this much closer to that step.  I hear her telling her father, friends and other relatives about moving out and I want to throw up.  Most parents look forward to the empty nest as their time to get out and spend time with each other, however, as a single parent, it just means I will be alone.  I know I can't keep her at home to keep me company (really, I can't???) but it would be nice to drag it out for one more year.  I enjoy having her with me so much (really, I do!!!) that I will surely miss her smiling face in the mornings...other things I will miss about having my darling teenager at home with me:  - bedside chats late at night about anything and everything - hearing "what's for supper" as I walk through the door after a long day at work - feeling her arms snake up around my neck as she seeks comfort after a particularly bad day - tripping over mounds of clothing that has been cast aside as she walks through the house...a coat here, a scarf there, a pair of mittens over there, six pairs of socks at the end of the couch... - hearing that laugh as we sit and watch episode after episode of Will and Grace - the running commentary on my appearance - "you're not gonna wear that out today are you?" or "aren't you gonna get dressed, you dirty old thing?"  many more...have to run now...will complete later... -

      Somehow, when someone sent this too me, it was fitting that I post it here...this was me last year.  Diary of a Snow Shoveler  December 8:  6:00 PM. It started to snow.  The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven.  It looked like a Grandma Moses Print.  So romantic; we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow!  December 9:  We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape.  What a fantastic sight!  Can there be a lovelier place in the Whole World?  Moving here was the best idea I've ever had.  Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like a boy again.  I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snow plough came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again.  What a perfect life!  December 12:  The sun has melted all our lovely snow.  Such a disappointment.  My neighbour tells me not to worry; we'll definitely have a white Christmas.  No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. I don't think that's possible.  Bob is such a nice man I'm glad he's our neighbour.  December 14:  Snow lovely snow!  8" last night.  The temperature dropped to -20.  The cold makes everything sparkle so.  The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway  And sidewalks.  This is the life! The snow plough came back this afternoon and buried everything again.  I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly get back in shape this way.  I wish law wouldn't huff and puff so.  December 15:  20 inches forecast.  Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels.  Stocked the freezer.  The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out.  I think that's silly.  We aren't in Alaska, after all.  December 16:  Ice storm this morning.  Fell on my rear end on the ice in the driveway putting down salt.  Hurt like you can't believe.  The wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel.  December 17:  Still way below freezing.  Roads are too icy to go anywhere. Electricity was off for 5 hours.  I had to pile the blankets on to stay warm.  Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it to her. God I hate it when she's right.  I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own living room.  December 20:  Electricity's back on, but had another 14" of the stuff last night.  More shoveling.  Took all day.  That dumb snow plough came by twice. Tried to find a neighbour kid to shovel, but they said they're too busy playing hockey.  I think they're lying.  December 21:  Called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower and they're out.  Might have another shipment in March.  I think they're lying.  Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me.  I think he's lying.  December 22:  Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches of the white crud fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt till August.  Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then I had to use the bathroom.  By the time I got undressed, went, and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel.  Tried to hire Bob who has a plough on his truck for the rest of the winter; but he says he's too busy. I'm sure he is lying.  December 23:  Only 2" of snow today.  And it warmed up to 0.  The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning.  What is she nuts?!! Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago?  She says she did but I think she's lying.  December 24:  6". Snow packed so hard by snow plough, I broke the shovel. Thought I was having a heart attack.  If I ever catch the son of a gun who drives that snow plough, I'll drag him through the snow by his ears.  I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been!  Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was busy watching for that snow plough.  December 25:  Merry Christmas. 20 more inches of the miserable slop tonight. Snowed in.  The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil.  God I hate the snow! Then the snow plough driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel.  The wife says I have a bad attitude . I think she's an idiot.  If I have to watch "It's a Wonderful Life" one more time, I'm going to scream!  December 26:  Still snowed in.  Why did I ever move here?  It was all HER idea.  She's really getting on my nerves.  December 27:  Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze.  December 28:  Warmed up to above -20.  Still snowed in.  The wench is driving me crazy!!!!!  December 29: 10 more inches.  Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave in.  That's the silliest thing I ever heard.  How dumb does he think I am?  December 30:  Roof caved in.  The snow plough driver is suing me for a million dollars.  The wife went home to her mother.  Nine more inches of snow predicted.  December 31:  Set fire to what's left of the house.  No more shoveling.  January 8:  I feel so good.  I just love those little white pills they keep giving me.  Why am I tied to the bed?

      I have a cold now.  I hate being sick.  I am not a good patient.  Amber felt sorry for me today and made me some KD...it was a comfort food now that I have finally gotten over the many years of being subjected to eating it daily by my parents.    The wind has died down some, but here comes the snow...  I don't like winter. I don't like snow. I don't like the cold. I don't like being sick. I want my mom.

      I think I detest the cold about as much as I detest snow...it has been downright frigid these past few days again...Antigonish had a wind chill of -50C, what the F***?  I came to Cape Breton thinking they have mild winters...lots of snow, no kidding on that one, but not this frigging deep freeze.  It is so cold and windy that my car almost doesn't start in the morning...good thing its a newer car, or I'd be out of luck.  I have wanted to get out walking since the new year, but if it isn't arctic deep chill out there, it is a blizzard...what a rotten winter.  I like the nice sunny winter days where there is no wind and the sun glints off the sparkly snow...instead I have this hell hole I am living in.  WAHHHHHH!  All my thoughts return to warm and sunny central america where we hope to be in mid April...just less than three months from now...ahhhhh...beaches, tropical waters, and fruity drinks...and, oh the tan I will return with!  Just at the beginning of summer here too.  My luck though, I will be eaten alive by mosquitoes and sick with malaria, burnt to a crisp, or waterlogged from the torrential rains.  but it would be warm and snow free.

      cold out today...freezing, actually!  But no new snow...although the old snow is now ICE and I have a huge slick of it in the driveway.  Good day to stay indoors.  So I have invited the gals from work over and we are going to commit some of the 7 deadly sins...sloth, greed, etc...ha ha...nachos, beer, lasagna, movies, lounging, crafts...chillin day.  There should be about 6 or 7 of us, so look forward to the fun.  I just sent one of the gals out for Tims...before the others get here.  I need caffeine!!!  the brilliant candy apple red hair is starting to fade a little so might need to touch it up a bit this week.  The resident teen dyed hers purple this week...VERY purple...  I applied for two jobs up north this week, just to see whats out there...am I crazy?  I hate snow and don't much like the cold, so where do I apply?  Victoria Island and northern BC...nuts!

      it is snowing again.  is it June yet?  I know I live in Canada, and better yet, in Eastern Canada, but does it have to snow every friggin day...its like all the nice days we had in December, the snow was saved up for this month and they are trying to cram it in.  Who are "they"?  I want to have a word...or two.  But I have a Brad, so I should be ok.  Snow from last night and today is gone from my driveway and walk...what do I REALLY have to complain about.  Except that I have to drive in it for work...and my car is filthy with salt and sludge...and I fear I will have an accident soon if I don't get some winter tires on that sucker.  Honestly, its all about the clothes though...I hate wearing winter clothes...its soo bulky!  I like wearing my jean jacket and thats it.  But I will wear my Columbia winter jacket, and forgo the jean jacket for now, but don't ask me to give up my sneakers...I don't even own a pair of boots.    Oh, and the wind has started up again, so now I don't hear the trucks as much.

      well holy tamale, it finally stopped snowing, and the wind has stopped BLOWING.  Now I can hear the damn trucks again.  But at least Brad is shovelling the snow!  Whoo hoo!  Everyone should have a Brad.  He is such a sweetie.    And the cold weather has gone, now it is a damp and slushy mess...I'll take it.  Just don't send me any more snow.  so now that it has stopped snowing, what will I bitch about?  work?  no, just kidding...things are going well in life...I just need some male companionship which is hard to come by in this one horse town...can't wait to move this fall.  My supervisor cringes every time I mention moving...they are desperate to maintain positions here.  They have one opening now that they cannot fill.  But I don't like it here enough to put in another winter after this one.  I never thought I would say it but nessicito un hombre...

      another blizzard, or maybe the same one...more snow...but yet I don't have to shovel it...thanks to BRAD.  Most of it has blown away again, anyhow...and the temp is finally at a respectable -5C or so...much more seasonable.  And I can close my frozen door again.  Strong winds have left me thankful that I live in a brick building (ok, mostly brick).  Sort of settles my OZ worries.    the resident teen and b/f are going out to supper tonight...where's my date?  Good question.  boo hoo.

      so the temp is going up SLOWLY and the snow is not as bad as it might have been...but still a blizzard warning for tonight...good night to curl up in the living room in front of the television...oh wait...mine nearly blew up the other day.  The resident teenager came home, turned it on and a high pitched SCREAM came from it, the picture was squiggly, then squished together and went altogether.  And that was the end of THAT.  Good thing its under warranty...bad thing the repair shop is 45 minutes away and we are in the middle of a blizzard these past two days.  I am hoping to get it over on Monday.  THANKFULLY I have two other littler tvs, and of course, I could always READ.    And guess who was dutifully out there shovelling me out again this morning...I tell ya...I am gonna be spoiled...what if she breaks up with the b/f???  So the weekend stretches long ahead of me...I am on call, so won't get up to much.  Perhaps a bit of much needed housework....HAR HAR HAR.  or I could just move the vcr into the bedroom with the little tv and camp out there for the weekend...

      um, maybe I hate the cold more than the snow...or at least almost as much.  It is FREEZING here.  -39C with the wind chill...  I have my electric blanket on HIGH.  On another note, the resident teen has just completed her last homework assignment for high school...note, LAST.  she has three exams left to write in the next week or so, and she will have completed grade 12.  And if she chooses, she does not ever have to go to school again after that...wow.  How can I be old enough to be the mother of a high school graduate???  And how do I help her celebrate this?  She has been sooooooo stressed lately, that she deserves something really great.  I am feeling old.

      finally!  I am reaping the benefits of the semi-live in b/f of the resident teen...Alas, it is early and my car is already shovelled out!  I have not lifted a shovel!  This is majorly exciting...and we had quite a dump of snow last night.  I can't wait to thank him for his efforts when I get home from work.    Now I have to drive in this stuff, and you will remember, I have no snow tires yet, only all-season radials.  I had the same tires last winter, and did fine, even with the enormous amounts of snow, but I had an agency car with studded tires to use for work.  Perhaps the true test of a good driver is how long you can keep out of the snowbanks without having snow tires on....HAR HAR!  4.5 hours in the computer lab with the resident teenager last night, finishing up her sociology project.  I didn't have to do much, just moral support to prevent the meltdown that happened the night before from recurring.  And you know what...computers labs have changed since I have been to high school...  This lab is reported to be the most well equipped school lab in Nova Scotia.  Man, I was impressed...its all MAC's but I was impressed just the same.  They have the HUGE flat plasma screens for many of them, plus the little pop-up toaster macs, ones you hover your finger over for them to come on (heat sensing), and the hard drives on them are unreal.  This lab is also the SAERC TV lab, on which they play public announcements, ads, and tv bingo.  They also have their own radio station.  Cameras - whatever you need - digital, analog, film, just ask.  For me, the drool factor was definitely the huge flat plasma screens...I remember the days of the black screen with harsh green print was all our lab had to offer and I didn't even get to use that.  We only had one computer class, and I began late that year and was not able to get in, so left high school without ever using a computer.  My first computer experience came in 1993 when I began using them at the local school in Grand Bruit, then I bought my first in 1994 - A Packard Bell 486...from there I went to an IBC (small company who builds them in Ontario) Pentium 333 Celeron.  Now I sport a Dell Dimension 2350 with a 1.75 GHz processor.    We've come a long way baby!

      driving in the snow is never really fun.  driving in the snow in the dark is never really fun.  driving in the snow at 1:00am is definitely not fun.  such was my night last night.  the day began when the resident teen wanted to go to a movie in Sydney.  Fine says I, but you will have to go to the early one, as you can't drive after midnight (graduated license).  Problem - she worked until 7pm and Sydney is  1.5 hours away.  Ok, so I make the plan to go down with my friends earlier in the day, meet the resident teen at the movie theatre after the movie.  That part all worked out...then came the drive home.  and we all know how much I hate snow.  It was clear driving down, and was clear for the first 20 minutes...then the blinding snowstorm came and I felt like I was driving across the antarctic.  No other cars, no plows, no sand/salt trucks, no police, no tracks in the snow...not even deer!!!  I was in no-mans land, for sure.  What in the hell was I doing in the middle of it with no snow tires on.  Yes, you hear right, no snow tires.  Well, we haven't gotten much snow thus far this winter, so I was waiting to see how it goes, in case it turns out to be one of those really weird winters where you never really get any.    so I am driving through the blinding snow at about 60-70kms/hr.  I don't know where in the hell the lines on the road are and it doesn't really matter much as I am the ONLY one out for most of the trip.  The odd truck passed me going the other way, leaving me in a whiteout of flying snow.  And it is COLD.  I thought I was never going to get home, and each turn I rounded brought a new level of fear as I envisioned my car hurtling through space and snow into the nearest lake.  Most of the drive brought me alongside the Bras D'Or Lakes or some such body of water.    and then I get 5 minutes from my house and there isn't a flake in the sky, nor much on the ground.  What in the HELL is THAT all about?  revenge on my whining about the snow I reckon.  So we get home at ten to two in the morning...YAWN...I don't think another late movie will be in order for some time now.  But at least the one I saw was good...Mona Lisa Smile...worth the trip down...not so sure about the trip back...

      well, the hair is still attached to my head...good news I think.  I am imagining what will be said at work tomorrow...I work for a conservative child welfare agency...HAR HAR HAR!  Funnily enough, I had a similar hair color during my video interview nearly two years ago and was hired...so what could they say?  I don't really worry about it, but some of my co-workers thought I should...heh heh...I just think it will help break the ice with manys a client, especially the teenagers that are so tough to get through to.  It certainly worked when I worked at the agency for street youth in Kitchener.  Now if I can just get the dye out from under my fingernails...  Back to work tomorrow...I guess that is the end of this glorious holiday season...I know Old Christmas Day is still yet to come on Tuesday, but my tree was long tossed out and trimmings thrown back in the box...good riddance, I say...and during the process, I de-cluttered the living room, moved a bookshelf, threw out some old junk, and cleaned out the Christmas trimmimgs box...lots of old junk in there...I am inspired by Clean Sweep...if they could just come to my house :-)  So I haven't heard from my buddy Shane lately...he can be found at  urlLink Hairy Hoser  I think he posts from work or some silly thing like that...  Still no real snow...had a flake or two last night, but it all melted...YAHOO!  So instead of getting the resident teen's b/f to shovel snow, he now does the dishes until we get some snow for him to tackle...works for me.  time to go brush the pinky hair before bed...

      so here I sit with a bag on my head...heard that joke manys atime...hah ha ha...  but seriously, I am bleaching out my hair again, and dying it pinky purple...again.  Only this time my hair is really long, and has many different colors of dyes residual in it now, so who knows what I will end up with.  In the past, certain pieces of hair have been resistant to bleaching, and remained black, which is what I am counting on, for black streaks that I don't have to do...  and it drives my mother wild...I told her I was dying my hair tonight and she thought (hoped) it was going back to my original color that "god" gave me.  What in the hell is that???  I haven't had my own hair color for so many years, I don't even remember...I've been dying it for about 20 years or so, and many different colors!  So I will finish up tonight by sending her a huge digital pic of my pinky purple hair...heh heh  the resident teen doesn't know that I am using up most of her hair dye...but oh well, she did the same with mine..she is tired of the pinky purple in her hair anyhow and wants to go to something else.  I ordered purple tonight, so perhaps she will touch up with that when it arrives next week.  Got a dusting of snow, but nothing to get my undies in a bunch over...funnily enough, the plow was in our parking lot at work when I got there...and we only had 1 cm...he didn't show up until late afternoon when we got 45cms last month...what a...  b/f of resident teen did the dishes for me today...awwwwww....I think I'll keep him.  He stays here 5 nights a week when he gets off work at 3am, and sleeps on the futon, so since there is no snow to shovel, he has taken to doing the dishes....awwwww...I am not complaining...I hate doing the dishes almost as much as shovelling snow.  I filed my requests for vacation time today...lets see how long it takes for my supervisor to stop laughing...I put in for 17 days off...

      So lists...for those of you who are insanely bored and reading my blog for something to break up your day...  Actually, my sister used to be the queen of the lists..wrote them for years in a binder.  Her favorite was people - hockey teams, people in her class, people she knew...And the resident teen thought it might be fun one day to write down every word she knew...got about 40 pages worth written before it lost its appeal.   My Five Favorite American Films    1. Lonesome Dove  - it is an epic tale.  Starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Diane Lane, Danny Glover,  Robert Urich, Angelica Huston, among many other great actors.  I just love it!  It was a mini-series on television with four episodes and I eventually went out and bought them, and have watched the whole series at least 30-40 times.  Robert Duvall as Agustus MacRae is a priceless character, and my favorite role he has ever played.  There's tears, humour, action, adventure, and culture...something for everyone!   2. The Joy Luck Club  - starring Ming Na who now acts on ER as Dr. Chen.  This movie is all about mothers and daughters and their sacrifices made for each other and themselves.  I just love the way it plays out and have watched it several times.  The book is just as enjoyable, and Amy Tan is a gifted writer.   3. Legends of the Fall  - starring Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Julia Ormand, to name a few.  Another tale with humor, tears, adventure and action, with great lines and even better acting.      4. Ocean's Eleven  - starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and a bunch of other great actors.  What an awesome movie.  This movie is put together so well, and just has great writing that it makes it a joy to watch over and over again.   5. The Shawshank Redemption  - last but not least - starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.  What an awesome tale, written by Stephen King, one of my favorite authors.  This movie is just a wonderful story, with stellar acting.  I can watch it again and again.  Now, because I am such a movie buff...there has to be another list -    Top 5 movies I like to drool over    1. A Time to Kill  -  starring Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock and Samuel L. Jackson.  oh Matthew...take that shirt off again.   2. A Knight's Tale  - starring Heath Ledger and whoever else...Heath, take your shirt off.   3. The Devil's Own  - starring Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford.  Brad with an Irish accent...and a not too terrible one at that.  He looks very yummy in this film, and very vulnerable at the end.   4. Lethal Weapon  - all of them - Oh Mel...you are getting old but damn you looked good in those movies!  You could melt steel with those blue eyes...   5. The Firm  - Tom Cruise - he may be short but what a mind - that's sexy!  I have to admit, making these lists was tough...I love too many movies and there are some really great ones I would love to add - I highly recommend watching  The Usual Suspects ,  Snatch ,  Notting Hill ,  Crocodile Dundee ,  Beverly Hills Cop  (just the first one),  The Karate Kid  (just the first and the fourth ones),  The Last of the Mohicans  - what a tale, good backpacker films like  Brokedown Palace  and  The Beach , a lovely family story -  Life as A House , a good old fashioned western -  American Outlaws , the old Brat Pack movies -  Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo's Fire, Betsy's Wedding, Sweet Sixteen, Some Kind of Wonderful ,  The Breakfast Club .  And lets not forget a true eighties favorite -  Fast Times at Ridgemont High  - even todays music videos are ripping it off! (look for the swimming pool scene where the gal in the red bikini comes out of the pool and catches the guy jacking off in the bathroom).  Some really good comedies -  Ed TV, The Mexican, What Women Want, Miss Congeniality , and the list goes on!    I could talk about movies all day, but instead, I think I will go watch one!

      now THAT's what I call timing.  I just drove the resident teenager to work and as I pull into the driveway, the plow goes by, leaving a two-foot bank behind me.  15 seconds would have made me a cranky woman unable to pull into her driveway.  I think there would have been something thrown at the plow driver.  But it was expert timing.  oh Braaaaadddd????  He is sleeping,  but will gladly shovel it out later.  He missed going to the gym yesterday, so will be aching for muscle exertion.  Never mind that he shovelled out twice as much yesterday, heh heh.  so I bought two skirts yesterday, and spent just $17 (tax incl).  never got the hoodie though, darn.  they didn't have them in yet.  just heard that there was an accident on the causeway...am talking to a friend who is stuck on this side of it...she has been sitting there for over an hour.  The accident was an empty transport trailer that blew into a car.  No real injuries that she saw, as the guy in the car got out and walked to the ambulance to be checked out.   Now that's timing !  She could have been the car who got hit if her timing was a little quicker.

      another day, another blizzard...the causeway is shut down, the schools are closed, my employer has called a snow day...what shall a person do?  How about shopping?  That's where me and the kid are headed right now...  I wonder what I shall indulge in today?  I am famous for going out for a package of paper towel or something and coming back with a new outfit.  I did hear that  Jeans Experts   has some new stock in and I am in the market for a hoodie, so I can fit in with my homies...HARHAHARHARH  So after reading my friend the Hairy Hoser's blog today, I thought I might think about doing my own lists of favorites...but I need a little time to think about mine...check back later for the lists...

      ok, its hump day...just two more days to save the world before the weekend comes...  so I got to talk to this really handsome sounding constable this afternoon...just one of those deep, masculine, I'm-so-buff sounding voices.  I spoke to him for about 15 minutes on the phone, but I think I am going to have to invent an excuse to speak to him in person...I want to see the body that goes with that voice :-)  Good looking guys are in short supply here in this one horse town...the gene pool is a little shallow if you get my drift.  The constable in question is actually in another town, so chances are that he might be good looking.  Big uproar in Cape Breton about a "sex booklet" which is an information booklet the Department of Health wanted to release to teenagers in grade 7-9 through the schools.  The ultra conservative school boards of this island voted a resounding NO.  The booklet talks about such things as masturbation, oral sex, anal sex and homosexuality, as well as safe sex, rape, stds, and self esteem.  My guess is that these ultra conservative people here feel that if they don't give their kids these booklets, then they will never know about it...or it won't exist...gawd, what rock are they hiding under???  Look to prime time tv and you will find ALL of it.  Why not offer them honest, reliable, educated answers to their questions through such a document that was prepared following extensive research by the Department of Health.  Its time for Cape Breton to open their eyes...what a bunch.  When I wrote to the public relations gal from the dept of health requesting the booklet, this was her response...  "Hi Jude,  Unfortunately the book is still in draft form and we were sharing only with school board representatives right now to see if they were willing to distribute it through the public school system.  So I can't share the draft publically at this stage.  The book is very well researched and written.  They did extensive consultation with youth - asking them what they needed to know or wished they had known earlier to help them make safer, healthier decisions.  There was also consultation and review by experts in sexual health , particularly youth sexual health.  The book deals in an honest and straightforward manner about issues of sexuality, healthy relationships and decision making, sexual assault and rape, how to talk to your parents, a doctor, etc., how to say no, preventing STIs and pregnancy.  It's not really new information...it's taking the information available from a variety of sources and repackaging it in a format that is easy for youth to access, read, and understand.  If we can't distribute the resource through the school system, we will look at other ways to make it available, such as through local public health offices.  Right now, though, we're still in early stages and don't have the finished document.  I'm sure that when it is ready, you'll hear about it through the media!  If you'd like a copy then, please send me an e-mail and we can get you one.  Hope this helps.  Thanks, Wendy  Wendy Barnable Senior Communications Advisor Office of Health Promotion"  You can bet I will be looking for my copy!

      trip to Sydney went well...snow, snow and more snow, and then we had clear road and I thought I was in Florida...well, maybe not Florida, but much better than the slop I had been driving in here. and then I came home again and it was still snowing...stop the madness!!!

      More Snow.  just what we needed.  We got anothe 20cms or more between yesterday and this morning and it is STILL snowing, with the radar looking like it will last all day.    urlLink more friggin snow   If I didn't have Brad to shovel for me, I would have crawled into the snowbank and died by now.  That boy is certainly earning his keep around here.  Today's snow is light, but what fell last week was very heavy and I could barely shovel the little I did at one point.  Halifax has lifted its curfew, and the State of Emergency has been lifted from the province as of last night.  Whatever, didn't see much evidence of it anyhow.  But looking at pics from Halifax, there is some friggin snow up there!!!  While we had quite a dump, they had quite a mess.  Of course, we don't have city streets either to clog, just the highway that runs through the centre of town.  I'm off to Sydney today, but imagine it will take a few hours to get there in this darn snow.  I wonder if its time to begin thinking about those snow tires yet...  The school is on its third snow day today...must be a record for them for sure.  And the resident teen doesn't get the benefit anymore as she has finished classes.  News on the Amber front, she was accepted to St. Francis Xavier University this past week, so we were excited!  She has two more universities to hear from, but with the snow days, and their closure for spring break, it might be a while.  She is just such a smarty pants...once we got her final transcript and saw it all neat and tidy there, as she had been in two high schools, and some of the courses from grade nine were given credit for grade ten, it looked quite impressive.  She has an overall high school average of 87, and a grade 12 average of 91.  Pretty awesome I think!

      ok, I ventured to Antigonish yesterday, the roads were acceptable...some ice, but not much snow.  Only to find out that the guy who owns the tv repair shop didn't bother to come in to work...perhaps due to snow, I don't know.  All I know is my tv is in there and I can't get it out.  he has such limited hours, I don't know when I will ever get there without taking time off from work.  Its beginning to really irritate me.  And so we went shopping instead (Brad and I) while Amber worked all day at A & W.  I managed to pick up a pair of pants and a skirt at Cotton Ginny...whoo hoo...Amber fears I have an addiction and should join a group for sufferers.  She is just jealous, I can feel it.     The sun was out beautiful yesterday and it was lovely...now it is overcast again and SNOWING...although I don't think we are to get much more snow, just a token flurry, so I will relax.   I have to head out to Sydney tomorrow for an appointment, so hopefully the roads are clear.  I see the "children" came home last night...and forgot to go to their separate rooms...however, I think they just fell asleep watching television as I peeped in after knocking (and getting no response) and found them both sound asleep, fully clothed.  Good thing...I may be understanding but I had one rule when Brad began sleeping over here...no conjugal visits while I am in the house.  I'll wait a little longer before going in to terrorize them...heh heh.  Brad was supposed to bypass drinking last night, so we shall see who has the hangover...is it my little miss?    Girls day again today...they seem to come all the time now, ha ha.  Maureen, Wendy, Kara, Kathleen, Stacey, Angela, Elizabeth, Elsbeth, and I shall be conjugating for the purposes of food, movies, crafts and gossip...sounds great!  I may have to get more chairs!!!  I am cooking spaghetti and meatballs for the gang, as well as sausages for snack...everyone else is also bringing something, so we will feast again today!    just hope the snow doesn't get in the way of our fun...

      well, here we are again, in winter hell.  Blizzarding all day, the province is basically closed down, and I am getting a little shack whacky...I have places to go today, and know I won't get there and what would be the point, as no one went to work today.  I can't see across the street, the wind is worse today than it was yesterday.  Yikes!  Good thing I went for groceries and water before this all began...  the power has been off and one, but not really off that long, thank goodness...we have electric heat!  Can't say the same for many others in the province presently without power.  the gang is still asleep, but I don't tend to sleep well in storms...lay awake for hours listening to the wind...wahhh  perhaps I'll give it a try again.

      ok, so I had to go out and shovel tonight.  The plow (aka devil incarnate) came round again and dumped me full of snow...not as much as before, but enough that it took me a while.  It was damn heavy too!  And there was one huge snow boulder that I had to pound at to break apart so I could move the pieces out of the driveway.  I had to shovel it right away or it would freeze in the driveway and then I would never get it out!  The plow came around twice more after that, but I was still out there, so he lifted his blade...lucky guy..I had my shovel poised to throw at him.  not that it would hurt him in his huge plow, but I would feel better...  and now its snowing again...just look at this damn radar...   urlLink more friggin snow   poor Brad will be busy again tomorrow...what a sin.  I can't make him get up in the morning to get me shovelled out yet again...He must have shovelled a full ton of snow tonight or more.  arrrrrrggggghhhhh...

      so we lived through it...lost the power for just 30 minutes and a few bumps besides.  I just took Brad to work and just as we were leaving the driveway, the neighbor who shares the driveway has a front end loader show up to clear the driveway, figures...after Brad spent 3 hours out there in the pissing rain, shovelling the concrete snow.  So I told them not to bother plowing anything from mine as it was fine as it was.  Damned if I was paying for them to plow the small bit that was left now.  Why they waited until we had ours all cleared is beyond me.    Anyhow, we took a little tour of the town...the only thing open was one Tim Horton's and NOTHING ELSE, not even a gas station, Wal-Mart, Sobeys, or anything.  Most of them don't even have their parking lots plowed yet.  Most of the side roads are only plowed one lane, or a lane and a half.  The wind and snow have finally stopped and it is just spitting rain.  If the roads freeze, they will be pretty slippery though, but thankfully, the high snowbanks will make for a very soft landing, har har.  I managed to convince the resident teen to play a board game with me this afternoon when the power was out.  It was a struggle...we played The Game of Life, and while she had twins and a son, I was left barren...boo hoo...my career was a police officer and hers was a travel agent.  My salary was a lovely $100,000 until she landed on switch salary cards...then I got her $50,000.  At least I had the cool Victorian house and she had the crappy mobile home, heh heh.  In the end, she won, due to my high salary card.  Now I have my Thursday night television to look forward to...gawd I live a boring life!  Friends, ER, Survivor, CSI, etc...  I hear the couch calling me again...

      offically a full snow day at work...sounds like its time for a midday nap.  Nova Scotia has declared a state of emergency...first time I've seen that!   urlLink state of emergency in nova scotia   gotta love it!    and the snow keeps on coming...helloooooo couch...

       urlLink big storm   The storm is even bigger today, and we are getting whomped.  8:00am I got up to go to work though, as there was no announcement on the radio about our office being closed, and since I work in a government office (but not for the government, but for a Board-run Children's Aid) it takes a lot of convincing to close down for weather.  So I just got out of the shower when the phone rang, and was told by a supervisor that the office was closed, at least until lunchtime.  Whoo hoo...now when do you think I should tell Brad to stop shovelling?  I'll get dressed first.    Then the phone rings again.  My friend Angela, who is taking over the on-call shift today from me...the office might be closed, but someone has to mind the pager, as it is the number people will get when the call the closed office...so until I get the chance to pass off the pager, I am still actually working.  Angela assures me she and her significant other will try to make it over this morning to rescue the pager, as they have a 4 wheel drive Jeep.  Ok then, no problem.    Then I get downstairs after getting dressed, and the phone rings again...our Office Manager calls to tell me the office is closed.  Ok, thanks for that.  Now I REALLY believe the office is closed...heh heh.  Then I finally get the chance to holler out the door to Brad to stop shovelling.  He can barely hear me over the howling of the blizzard.  I can hardly see him as he is covered in snow.  poor thing.  He can hardly get a breath out becuase he is coughing so hard from his cold....no, I'm just kidding...lol  So Brad comes in, covered in snow and announces that while he put a good dent in the snowbank, there is still 2 feet on the road, so I won't be going anywhere anyhow.  Fine...come dust yourself off and rest for a while until the office opens at noon.  heh heh.  9:00am - Angela and Rob show up for the pager and duty bag (aka dirty bag - it weighs about 40lbs).  I had forgotten that I left it in my trunk, so must get dressed to go get it out for her.  Wow, where did all this snow come from.  All of Brad's efforts have been blown over in snow, and the plow has been around and left me with a 3 foot snowbank at the end of my driveway.  Getting the bag out of the trunk requires some manuevering as the car is under a foot of snow...but I managed, and then slipped and pushed my dear friend Angela into the 3 foot snowbank at the end of my driveway...by accident, of course.  Anyhow, the dirty bag has a new home, and I am off work for the day.  Lovely.  I just happen to be off tomorrow too, as one gets a full day off with pay for carrying the dirty bag for a week.  See y'all next week!  Whoo hoo!  So here we sit in the howling winter, warm and cozy...the resident teen has been notified that her workplace has closed for the day and Brad has heard on the radio that his campus is closed...but yet, here we are at 9:20am, no one with anywhere to go, and we are all wide awake and freshly showered...what's wrong with us?  We should be buried deep in comforters, turning over for a second nap!    Not sure what I will get up to today...likely some movie watching...good thing I have such a huge collection (over 100).  And they are forecasting freezing rain to follow this snow...what a mess that will be....oh Brad...

       urlLink storm radar   Now THAT'S a storm...the Weather Network is forecasting 50+cms of snow for tonight and tomorrow...oh fluck.  Guess I will get the measure out of Brad now...heh heh.  We'll see just how much he has to shovel...poor thing, he is sick too...how can I ask him to go out and shovel snow when he is feeling so poorly.  But yet, I will.  Because I HATE IT!  Got stuck in a client's driveway today so had to get them to help push me out...wasn't that lovely.  At least she didn't have the rage that last year's client had, which could be good or bad...last year I had just come from the client's home and was backing down her long driveway that I had not been able to get up in, after delivering bad news to her that I was going to take her to court because of her behaviour and I got stuck.  I got stuck BAD.  I had another worker with me and we could not, could not, could not get it out.  We shovelled, and pushed and spun the tires and could not get it out.  So I finally had to give in and go back to the house with the angry mumma, and ask her to help get us out of the driveway so we could leave.  This woman is very large...Amazonian you might say...6 feet tall, and BROAD shouldered, has done her share of construction work, and remember, she had just been given some bad news, so there was definitely some RAGE in her by now.  Well, she bent down in front of the front bumper, and grabbed hold...lifted my car up and THREW it back into the driveway.  I gunned it and got the hell out of Dodge...  So the mumma today, did not have any bad news given to her, but helped out just the same, and after a few evergreen wreaths tossed under the tires for traction, and she and a fellow worker pushing, we were off once again.  Although she didn't have any bad news given to her, I think there was still some rage in her too, because she put her whole body into it to get me out of her driveway.    Interesting how the client and fellow worker keep getting assigned to pushing duty...heh heh...truth is, I have a 5 -speed transmission and neither could drive a stick.  Woe is me.    I am still holding out on buying winter tires just yet...I am waiting to see how the winter goes.

      ok, its downright freezing out...any need of that?  got a distressing phonecall tonight...someone close to me disclosed that they had been sexually abused by another relative in my ex-family aka outlaws.  most distressing...it happened 20 years ago, and I am in shock.  I just want to go and cut his thing off.  and then I think, how could we not know this was going on?  just when you think this dirt is not in your family and that no one related to you would ever do that...actually, its the second instance I have in my family...heard a few years ago that a cousin of mine had been sexually abused by her father for years.  He is now deceased, and we could never understand her behaviour, until we found out what he had done and then it all made sense.  And then this person who called me tonight, informed me that my ex-mother in law was sexually abused last fall in the senior's home she is living in by another resident.  She has severe memory loss, and would never know who was doing it to her, but someone caught him in the act.  What is wrong with people????  I work with this shit all day, and now I come home and hear about it all night.  You would think your own family is immune to it or something, but they're not.  This stuff seems to be all around us, like a cancer.    so, like a good friend, I listened for nearly two hours while this woman poured her heart out to me.  I wish I could go over there right now and give her a big hug, but she lives in another province.  she also told me that her sister was also sexually abused by the same uncle.  how could we not know???

      another sunny day...I don't think I can take it.    actually, I think spring might be on its way...it was a lovely snowmelting kind of day  found out a friend of mine is going to Spain in April, while I am in CA...she hasn't been backpacking before so will have a blast, I'm sure!  I remember my first trip, it was awesome!  I went to the Republic of Ireland, and there were castles by day and pubs by night...I loved it!  I have to decide whether or not I want to set up a separate blog for the trip or just to continue here...stay tuned :-)

      nicer weather today...sunny AND mild.  I still want the snow to be gone though, and I can't wait until camping weather hits...I would go now, but I would be alone.  I started another afghan yesterday for the resident teenager.  Its a variegated red, blue, yellow, green knit, with a navy contrast.  Something to keep me busy during those long winter nights.  I finished my own, and it looks very nice, surprisingly...  lots to think about these days...planning the trip to central america for one, which I haven't done piss all on lately...still waiting for the tax refund to come so I can buy the damn ticket...but otherwise, I am thinking about looking for a new job this fall, and making a move to Halifax.  no one wants me to leave here, but I am wilting in this dead end town!  How can I take this job and live somewhere in the city?  A long commute???   the rising of the resident teenager proved to be not as fun as hoped...she was just waking up anyhow...darn.  I was hoping for more of a reaction.  Lets see what today brings...they woke me up last night, so I have to seek revenge for that...we also need to have a House Meeting about it...she won't like it a bit and will think I am overreacting, but here are the circumstances...  said teenager has her own room...boyfriend of said teenager is staying in room next to said teenager by my good graces and desire to see successful outcome from his college program and work experience.  boyfriend arrives home from work at 12:15am now, as opposed to the 3am arrival when proposal was first set forth in late November.  boyfriend must rise early in the morning and be in classes at 7:30am.  said teenager is no longer in school as she has completed high school as of two weeks ago.  boyfriend did not go to bed when he returned home last night and instead went into said teenager's room to watch television until at 1:35am, management was awakened by second floor roaming to bathroom, and noise from television.  management rapped sharply on said teenager's room door and demanded quiet and turning down or off of television.  various and assorted grumblings from both sides of the door.  management was then too riled up to sleep so called sister in BC (4 hours behind) and vented loudly to her...murmerings and movement from said teenagers room, and exit by boyfriend to his own room...something must have been overheard...I wonder HOW?     So in light of last nights events, management must hold house meeting to clarify what the house rules are.  No conjugal or latenight visits on work nights.  boyfriend must be reminded of why he is permitted to sleep at home of management.  management values a good nights sleep above most everything and to disrupt this is sacrilige...  capice?

Maybe I should just start my own patch inside...I hate winter...whine, whine  at least the sun is out...there's that...  time to call the resident teenager and get her out of bed...just because she is finished school doesn't mean she can sleep whenever she wants...wasting the day away... ;-)  I am a tormenter...

      ok, more snow again...what's up with that???  Brad is back here again, so will shovel it out later, but the damn stuff is drifting...wicked whiteouts at times.  I'm in msn chat right now with some DE students I have gotten to know over the years...I was going to watch the grammy awards tonight, but not really into them...I have to telly on in another room, that's enough...I don't want to risk another nipplegate...LOLOL  got the mittens done, now have begun another afghan, this one for the kid...she didn't want to learn how to knit it herself...boo hoo!  Oh well, got nothing better to do this winter!

      so we got some snow...not a lot and then the rain took much of it away again...whoo hoo!  The girls stopped by and we went to Whycocomagh to look for the salon out there that tints eyelashes and eyebrows...the girls are fair haired, so want that done...me on the otherhand have trouble hacking back the unibrow...lol  it was a slushy ride, but not too bad...we were also browsing furniture, clothes and other household items.  KM bought some yarn and needles and sat while I taught her to knit mittens.  I taught her how to knit a square for an afghan the last time...she has been doing well!  So there's our Saturday night, wild times...me, KM and KB sitting around knitting and watching While You Were Out on TLC...what a bunch of old ladies, har har...  the kid is at work again, and not sure where Brad is...the driveway got shovelled and looks good.  So now I have the rest of the night to sit and knit mittens while watching television...the girls have gone home now, to do probably much the same.  KM brought her new project home, while KB was knitting a small blanket for the resident feline, and left that one here.  hope there is only blue skies in the forecast for tomorrow...

      I spoke too soon...massive snow storm on the way tonight...wahhhhhhh   urlLink the weather network   the radar image is shows massive storm potential...we'll see what we actually get out of it.  parts of nova scotia are getting rain, so perhaps we will be that lucky, although with the temps down where they are here in cape breton today, it will be SNOW.  dammit.  so today I have the day off...my reward for working on-call for one week...its great!  I just wish I could sleep in like the others in the house.  But 8am comes and I am WIDE awake.  I also hate to waste the day, so get up.  I wrote a whole bunch of e-mails to friends, and not a group one either, but actually took the time to write about 10 personal e-mails.  Things are getting too easy these days...group e-mails, christmas newsletters, etc.  no one sends a handwritten message anymore, and although I am most guilty of being sucked in by technology, I do miss getting an actual letter in the mail...all I see these days are bills and junk mail.  have we lost something by gaining in technology?  is letter writing becoming a lost art?  I used to write to my parents and sister all the time, now they get e-mail, but is it the same?  They somehow seem impersonal...and to tell the truth, I think I am forgetting how to make my letters...I type all my notes at work, I use only e-mail...the only writing I do regularly is to sign my rent check...which I have just remembered that I have to track down the landlord today to give it to him...I drive over there daily, hoping to catch him, but they are such busy people, and there are no mailboxes in this town, I can never nab him...I will soon start mailing them to him...  now my hands are cold, so must find task that involves warming them....

      ahh, the rains have come...at least some of it.  The snow is melting fast and I am happy.  Perhaps spring is on its way, in which case, this would be the shortest winter I have ever lived through.  I can handle that.  the long night stretches in front of me yet again...resident teenager is at work, as is her significant other.  Just me and kitty here, minding the store.  I hope there is something good on the telly, but then I do have a movie trilogy I borrowed from my friend, Angela - Raiders of the Lost Ark...gotta love that Harrison Ford.    I've been reading all about Nipplegate...what a farce...she doesn't look one bit sorry that she exposed her fake boob for all to see.  She got the reaction she was looking for...more publicity.  It doesn't seem to matter to stars whether it is negative or positive.  I subscribed to the newspaper again last night.  First daily news I'll have had in a few years.  I used to get the Kitchener-Waterloo Record for about a year, but then we moved.  I must say, I have never even seen a delivery person here...so I didn't think they had home delivery.   We shall see if anything shows up before the bill.  I just hope they wrap them in plastic, as this town doesn't have mailboxes.    time to see what I can get into now...

      so the rodent thinks winter will end early.  good for him.  if it doesn't there will be rodent pie...  it hasn't been so bad though...I should have had a Brad last year....har har har  temperature was actually above 0C for most of the day...I didn't even wear a jacket back to work after lunch.  I got a referral about some kids in Florida, and shucks, the boss wouldn't let me go there to investigate...I had to refer it out to their agency instead.  Not fair!  I could have stayed extra long to help them count the presidential ballots...HAR HAR  planning in earnest for the trip to central america...all I need is money to book the ticket and we're off!  got my holidays approved today for 23 days off...now I need to focus on getting those vaccinations this week.  I wonder how big the needles are...  the resident teenager arrived home Saturday night or should I say, Sunday morning, at 4:00am or so...I had only a blurry eyed glance at the clock as she and the boyfriend strolled in the door.  At least she is home in one piece.  It was a long night...gotta get those ground rules set so as to avoid future sleepless nights!  time to tuck in now and wait for rain to start...whoo hoo!  hope it takes most of the snow.

      ok, I don't know how I like this whole no curfew things for the resident teenager.  I had promised her that once she finished school, she could drop her curfew, and that all I would like from her is a phone call to let me know if she was coming home that night or not, or a check-in at midnight.  She left earlier tonight for a friend's house to celebrate his birthday, and left me a note saying she would likely be home tonight, which meant she would be home by about midnight as the others would probably go to the bar and she can't get in (not that she hasn't tried!).  It is now 1:20am and no word or sign from the child.    Knowing her, she is probably just asleep over there, as she doesn't usually last late anywhere...however, I would like to know that....my overactive brain just worries.  She has a cell phone, but of course, leaves it in her purse, which she throws under a chair as soon as she gets there.  It just rings and rings, so what's the point?  ARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH....I am in my mother's world...worrywart hell!  It is bitter cold tonight, only to add to my worries...what in the hell will I ever do when she moves out...I'll just have to check into "la nut farm"...  looks like a dusting of new snow on the ground...nothing to shovel yet though, good thing as Brad is at the party with resident teen!

      sun, sun and more sun...its GLORIOUS!  No rain or snow in sight...how cool is that?  The snow is melting ever so fast, and without rain, it is not the messy flooded mucky mess it usually is.  There is still a lot of snow to go, but I can see the difference every day, hour by hour...whooo hooo!  We had our first BBQ on Friday, but it wasn't complete...today we have our first complete BBQ, complete with potato salad and pasta salad, huge steaks, and larger appetites...yummy!  Watch me end up in some big mess at work and miss it...  I had to leave a little reminder out to the "roomies" in the house...the dishes haven't been done in two days...and we know the boy isn't busy shovelling snow..there was such a clutter on the cupboard that I knocked yet another glass off onto the floor and it smashed to smithereens.  So as soon as I saw him this morning, he immediately informed me he would do the dishes after classes today.  I almost feel like a bitch in expecting him to do the dishes when he works and goes to school, BUT then I remember that he is staying here rent free and he does get a few hours in between...they just chose to go out and hang with friends at Timmys instead.  So the guilt doesn't last long.  I just really hate doing the dishes, and when I get home from work, I am wiped out.  I also expect the resident teen to pull her weight a little more as she is not attending school now, and has most of her days at home, as she works mostly evenings.  I will get on her case next...lol

      so girls day was a smashing success...most everyone came, and we had a great time...roll call was, in order of appearance ( think)  Jude (moi) and Via (kitty) Angela Kara-Leigh Wendy Shelley Heather Stacey Kathleen Cibele Maureen Amber (the resident teen - she didn't really socialize much, and then left)  we didn't watch any new movies, just some we owned - The Trailer Park Boys (part of the second season, what a riot) Pretty Woman How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Kiss the Girls   so now I still have some that I rented to watch, but I have until Friday...might go take a look at one now - Finder's Fee.  I started watching it earlier today, and it was pretty good I guess.

         the great canadian DE trek     So it looks like some of my fellow DE students (referring back to when I was actually a student) are discussing making a documentary about our linkers (which is what we call ourselves on the listserve we all belong to) by following a linker across the country and that linker stays a night with a linker in each of the provinces, and visit as many as they can along the way.  It began with our buddy, Shane   urlLink the Hairy Hoser  talking about making the trek, then came the talk about me applying for a job up north and the mention that I would have to drive all the way to the North West Territories, so now there is talk of following me AND Shane for the documentary, which would be way cool.  I just finished reading a book  Round Ireland With a Fridge , which was hilarious.  It was about an English guy who bet his buddy that he could hitchike around Ireland with a bar fridge, and he did and wrote the book all about his travels urlLink Round Ireland With A Fridge    I would love to write a book about my travels, and across this country would be wonderful!    So I will give serious thought to my trek and WHEN I get a job up north, I will have to talk to my friends on the link about this trek!  I can't wait to meet some of them, although I have met more than a dozen of them over the past 7 years.  All wonderful people, with the exception of a couple of troublemakers who shall remain nameless...  great idear, huh?

      now we're back to the hair thing again...had SOOOOOO many compliments about the short purple hair, that my friggin head swelled and I have to dye my hair again...har har...actually the part about the compliments is true...but my head is big enough.  So anyway, the roots had grown out so much, that I had to bleach out again, and thats what I spent part of tonight doing.  Only I have not yet followed up with the purple dye as I just wasn't in the mood.  So I am going to bed as a bleach blonde tonight, something I have never been...and I have not gotten anything close to a compliment...actually been told by three people how blondeness does not suit me.  I guess I have to pull out the purple dye tomorrow...  Rain coming tomorrow...does this mean that winter is offically over?  Technically it is, but is it official?  have we seen the last of new snow???  tune in tomorrow for a fresh bitchfest if it isn't...

Now I will be getting ready for Survivor tonight and will be all set...hope nothing stupid happens on there tonight!  The resident teen is out at a friend's house, watching a movie, so no whiny teenager around the house...  must go and enjoy it all...

      on a brighter note...the whole Blankets Cape Breton thing is finally taking off.  I printed up the brochures, and began distributing after checking with the dropoff places if it was okay to drop squares there, and they were wonderful about it.  I called the local transition house   urlLink Leeside Transition House   and they were excited about the blankets, then I went to the senior's home and spoke to the activity director there and gave her some brochures, who also thought it was a grand idea, so here we are, our own chapter of Blankets for Canada!  I can't wait to get our first blanket sewn up.  I have many more brochures to be distributed if we want to make a go of it, so will be busy in coming weeks, dropping them off and networking.  I have to enlist my partner in crime, Cibele to get busy too.  She was to stop by with some brochures in Cheticamp yesterday and ask about getting it translated to french for the many french population in the counties....happy knitting!

      so I begin again...after the peace march, we all went back to my friend's place for some cold beers and tea, and some lively chatting.  I hung out there for the night, had a wonderful breakfast the next day and headed back to the void that is Port Hawkesbury...  Yesterday I was getting ready to go to Sydney and wanted to drive during office hours as I wasn't that busy at work, and I was planning on meeting up with a former coworker in Sydney.  I was going to Sydney on business, so this was ok...I just had to be out of the office by 3pm...at 2:15pm, I get a call from the lawyer who is representing the agency in Sydney, with whom I have to meet at 8:30am the next morning.  Now, I had been in contact with this person since December, knowing he was going to call me as a witness to give testimony on a file.  Sure, no prob.  Today he throws in there, just 45 minutes before I am to leave town to drive to Sydney..."by the way, did I mention that you need to bring a current CV?"  OH FUCK. No, mister, you did not mention that little tidbit and I haven't updated my CV since I lived in Ontario in June of 2002...I have little or nothing social work related on there.  "Well, this judge requires a CV from everyone who offers testimony"...OH FUCK.  So, after I hang up from him and much more colorful language, I tear home to get my disc with my CV on it(he's lucky I actually live in town, not like many of my coworkers who live a half hour drive away), come back to the office to attempt to update it, and realize that the brand new Word Perfect Garbage that I have on my computer and have complained about since they put it on there and made me take off my own copy of MS Word, does not open my CV properly...in fact, it screws up all the formatting, loses loads of the data, and generally fucks it up.  So I stamp scream curse, etc...then pound downstairs to use the one computer that does have Word on it...I throw something together, and realize the next day that I have not changed my address, nor the status of me actually graduating from being a candidate to graduate...not a happy camper.  The CV finally gets printed off...  and there I am, tearing off to Sydney, 15 minutes late, but my friend isn't bothered...we went out to a lovely supper at Swiss Chalet and then I went back to the hotel to relax.  The next morning, I am up bright and early to meet the lawyer for some prep time, that all goes well, and he tells me that I won't actually be on until noon or later...fine...I am going back to the hotel to veg.  Then at 11:00am, he calls to tell me they have adjourned until JUNE, and we might not need you at all.  thanks a lot bud...  The rest of the day was even worse...I cracked my face on my car door, slammed my toes into my filing cabinet, and some hero thought it would be funny to change a bunch of stuff around in my office...like switching all the drawers, turning around all the cards in my address file, taping weird pics of guys up on the walls, shit like that.  I was just not in the headspace for it...and to add insult to serious injury...I called into work on my way back to town from Sydney only to be told I needed to come right in as we had an intake investigation, so I rushed home, dragged the kid off to see someone she needed to see - they weren't there, I barked at the fellow there that I was wasting my lunch hour to bring her there, why in hell isn't he there when he told us to come him...blah, blah, blah...go dump the kid off home, rush back to work, only to find out that my coworkers were playing a joke on me...no real intake at all actually...ha fucking ha.  so it has been a bitch of a day...I left early and went and ran some errands and came the fuck home.  I can't be around people right now...

      Wow, where have the days gone...I was in a peace march on Saturday afternoon in Grand Narrows, my first ever.  I even made some placards and they went over very well...my slogans were:  Canadians Love Peace (love being a heart/peace symbol) Use Words Not Weapons Peace Creates Peace and one other one that I can't remember...I only carried one of them, and gave the others away.  In any event, it was the second year Grand Narrows has had one, and the papers even wrote about it in advance.  the Halifax Herald and the Cape Breton Post.  My friends Madeleine and David were the organizers of it, and I stayed with them overnight in Grand Narrows.  It was FREEZING cold for the march, and the wind whipped through the Barra Strait, carrying snow and our voices, but we had so much fun, and the miserable weather is certainly nothing to endure compared to what those in war are enduring.   I took pictures and will post them on Hip Forums and link here shortly... urlLink Peace March   I will have to finish this blog later as I am trying to do too many things at once!!!

I had a busy week, and was glad not to have to go in and face it all today.  Today is all about relaxing, and getting some shopping done.  I am trying to wake the resident teenager and b/f up but I guess I am not making enough noise...heh heh...they work tonight at 5 and 6.  I called my friend Kathleen to get her on the move today as she is also off, but no luck...we might be doing something together later.  so here I sit, alone again, but not for long...

        Saint Patrick's Day    So last night I went to a party for Saint Patrick...it was a blast...not the usual party where I drink too much and regret it in the morning, but this was a more musical one, where it was a work night, we all began early, I had one glass of Harp, and the musicians outnumbered the rest of us.  There were bodrans, pea whistles, fiddles, guitars, a banjo, electric piano, and an accordian.  The music went all night until I left at midnight, and was decidedly Irish/Celtic.  I had a wonderful time, and found out that the host is a distant cousin of mine...what could be better?  The food was good, and of course, there was Irish Stew...as well as orange and green jello shooters...we were all watching who was picking which...lol  All throughout the night, the music stopped and someone had to read out an Irish Blessing/Saying with their thickest Irish Brogue and the winner received a prize.  The judge was a charming older musician who was acutally Irish born, and had some seblance of an accent.  The winner for the night was my friend, Rob...who reamed it off quite well.  Thanks to the both of us practicing with the watching of Waking Ned Devine before we went out...lol.  We also kissed a makeshift Blarney Stone...which was actually a piece of Newfoundand slate that had been etched...I bought it on the gulf boat many years ago.  Stones were pretty scarce because of all the snow we have, so it was the next best thing!    so, all in all, it was a wonderful night, and I was glad to have been invited.  Now I have to set about figuring out the exact geneology that links me to the host.  He is a Lamey, which is my grandmother's maiden name, and she is from this town we live in now, which he is also from.  Small world!  and I never got to drink green beer...snakes! (instead of rats)  but I did get a prize for having the "reddest" hair, which is looking kind of purply-pinky-red.  It was a pad of sticky notes with My Heart is in Ireland on them.  now here's something to leave y'all with...   May the lilt of Irish laughter lighten every load May the mist of Irish Magic shorten every road May you taste the sweetest pleasures that fortune ere bestowed and may all your friends remember all the favours you are owed   and one final note...    There are many good reasons for drinking one has just entered my head if a man doesn’t drink when he’s living how in hell can he drink when he’s dead?

      and now we are getting more snow...snow, snow, snow...when the first day of spring arrives, does the snow stop?  LMFAO  I hope Brad shovels the driveway before I get home...  so I am off work tomorrow...YAHOO!  I have been on duty for the past week, so I get a day off on Friday, automatically.  Which is wonderful!  I have been waking up at 6am lately and then managing to fall back asleep by 6:30am, only to have the alarm stop my heart at 7:15am...some mornings I practically lift off the bed, it startles me that much...not to mention where the kitty lands...I will be right on track once the times spring ahead next month.  The resident teenager and I went to Halifax on Monday to tour the campus of  urlLink Saint Mary's University .  We really liked it and she can't wait to go there.  I bought her a SMU hoodie, so now she HAS to go.  Now I want to go again too...boo.  I am considering returning to school in a year or two to do a master's program, but the difficulty is in deciding a major.  I am interested in so many things, but can't settle on just one, and it changes each week.   This week I am interested in pursuing the  urlLink Masters of Criminology  program there.  It looks really interesting and I hope that I will satisfy the prerequisites.  I have a BA in Sociology with the option in Criminology and Legal Studies for my first undergrad degree.  My second one is a BA in Social Development Studies and my third was a Bachelor of Social Work.  Perhaps I will e-mail their department to find out.  The other program I am interested in is a Masters of Psychology at just about any university...definitely NOT UW as I have enough degrees from them.  I want something that looks different, ha ha.  As well, I could always do the MSW, Masters of Social Work, which I would easily get into I think, but I am not convinced that is something that I need.  Decisions, decisions!  And then I remember about all my student loan DEBT and I get discouraged and figure I will never see a masters...  So then I start thinking about moving up north next spring to work for some big $$$ and get a handle on my student loan debt.  I will likely do this, as I can't stand being suffocated by this debt right now.  I have a negative balance in my bank account right now and I just got paid...what's up with that?  By the time each respective institution is finished dipping into my bank account, there is very little left for me!!!  Thankfully I am expecting money tomorrow, or we'd be eating Kraft Dinner all week.  Is this what I went to university for???    Oh, and those crooks at Revenue Canada have still not coughed up my tax refund.  so much for e-filing to obtain an early refund...I filed on February 9th, one hour after they opened for business this year...and still nothing yet.  ARRRRRGGGGGHHHH.  so until I get something from those vampires, I cannot even begin to think about our trip to Central America.  which distresses Amber somewhat, but she will live with it as there is nothing we can do about it.  I have already called and bitched about it, to no avail.  whine.  pass the cheese.

      Ok, now for the developments from SB and EX.  Well, EX appeared in our former community last week, where we still jointly own a home.  Which was fine.  I took it as a sign he wanted to get away from SB, and going to the tiny outport of Grand Bruit would be a great way to do that.  He opened up the house again, and settled in.   THEN she showed up last night.  I had already had a discussion about that SB being in my house again, after I found out about her current criminal record and charges.  I was quite clear, actually...now that SB is in my house, sleeping in MY BED!!!  Now, I don't have a problem with EX finding true love again, but not with this particular conniving wench.  She is a convicted fraud queen, and has been nothing but a manipulator since he met her.  All I know is she better not get any ideas about what to do with MY house.   I know it is technically OUR house, which is fine, and its not even about the green monster of jealousy...GAWD NO.  It is about her getting her claws into my house, and doing something to it.    So the EX has also decided to smoke in the house.  I have a no-smoking sign posted there and it has been up for many years.  I gave up most of my vacation last summer (10 days) to paint almost the entire house and now he is stinking it up with his dirty cigarette smoke.  That will be ANOTHER conversation.    From all reports, SB showing up in Grand Bruit was a surprise to EX, so hopefully he packs her back on the boat again this morning and sends her back to where she came from.  If she stays, I can't believe he can be so stupid.  She is obviously POISON to him and he should cut her out of his life like the disease that she is.  Ok...enough ranting...that SB has already taken up too much of my thoughts for the day and to use the words of a fellow blogger, the  urlLink hairy hoser  I'm all about the love...so lets get back to that...

      another weekend of lounging/sloth here in camp cape breton...and it has begun to snow...goody, something to bitch and whine about again.  I don't think it is supposed to amount to much though.  I am knitting an afghan for the resident teenager, and had to run out to get more yarn at the trusty Wal-Mart today...I had forgotten that it is now March Break...the mall was a ZOO.  Thankfully, not many at the checkouts yet as I was out there early...they were still browsing, so I was out in a flash.    Stopped by to get a couple of movies at our new movie store and am struck by how LONG it takes them to check you out at the movie store.  There was only one person ahead of me, and you would THINK that I could be through and out the door in 3-5 minutes.  NOT.  Try 10 minutes.  And they were only renting 2 games and a movie.  This movie store is new though, and I guess I should cut them some slack, but each and every time I go in, it takes forever to check out.  They have computers too, but they have certainly not sped up the process in any way.  I get much faster service at the local convenience store's movie checkout.  The new movie store is a   urlLink Movie Gallery  and the first large store to come to Port Hawkesbury that I know of.  It is much like a Blockbuster, which is GRAND!  Up until now we have only had a tiny movie store which rented one or two copies of new releases, and a convenience store that rented the same.  Neither held old movies, or much of a selection.  Oh, and the gas station up the road rented about 50 movies.  So now I am happy, except for the wait.  I have rented two for tonight:   Runaway Jury  A businessman is gunned down in a vicious office attack, leaving behind a grieving wife and child. Is the murderer solely responsible for his actions or does the gun industry bear some of the blame? What would your verdict be? Would ten million dollars change your mind? Based on the John Grisham bestseller, Runaway Jury stars John Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman as the principles in a cat-and-mouse game played on two levels. Rankin Fitch (Hackman) has been hired by the gun industry for his expertise in jury selection, tampering and intimidation. Nick Easter (Cusack) and the mysterious Marlee (Weisz) conspire to ransom the verdict; Easter from inside the jury while Marlee negotiates with Fitch and plaintiff attorney Wendell Rohr (Hoffman) on the outside. To avoid being discovered, Nick and Marlee must stay a step ahead, as their agenda is revealed to be more than money. Briefly featuring fine actors such as Luis Guzman and Jeremy Piven, the film chooses plot over character development. So much is packed into its 127 minutes, Runaway Jury sometimes feels like a runaway train.   and   Laurel Canyon   Writer/director Lisa Cholodenko follows up her much-acclaimed 1997 debut High Art with this examination of a young couple seduced into a hedonistic, left-coast lifestyle. Taking its title from its central locale, Laurel Canyon focuses on a pair of upper-middle class lovebirds from the East Coast who relocate to Los Angeles. Freshly minted from Harvard, Sam (Christian Bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) are eager to continue their medical studies out West, but they need some lodging while they hunt for a home. Enter Jane (Frances McDormand), Sam's estranged, Age-of-Aquarius mom, who's more than willing to put the couple up in her lavish digs. Jane is a successful record producer whose latest charge -- both in the studio and in her bedroom -- is Ian (Alessandro Nivola), a brazen, libidinous twentysomething Brit-rocker. As Sam and Alex settle in at Jane's, they gradually lose their straight-and-narrow approach to life and begin to experiment. Alex takes to Ian and Jane, while Sam is wooed by co-worker Sara (Natascha McElhone). Laurel Canyon features a score by Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren; the music for Ian's band was provided by Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous and indie-rockers Folk Implosion. ~ Michael Hastings, All Movie Guide    Lets hope they are worth the wait...

      ok, so now I know how to get out of a choke hold, block a punch or a kick, and get out of a wrist hold.  Hope I never end up in that situation, but it is good to have some idea of what I'm doing.  Now its back to work tomorrow, seeing what crap I can stir up...lol  heard a rumour that a strong northeaster is on its way.  bring it on I say...it certainly can't get any worse that what we've had.  and I am still without snow tires...waiting to see how the winter goes...  its been a blah night...not much going on except laundry.  whoo hoo.  I am considering beginning a local chapter of  urlLink blankets4canada  here in the Strait area.  Read all about it and if you are inspired, perhaps you can donate to a local chapter, or begin your own!  I am working on designing a brochure for our chapter, based on the sample one on the site.  I already have enough squares for half a blanket before we actually begin!  It sounds like a wonderful cause, and I have been to the Yahoo group where the stats are of how many blankets have been given out in a given year and the numbers are phenomenal!  Part of the process is to put a label on the blanket from the chapter it was donated from and perhaps down the road, you may hear about one of your blankets making it somewhere, or how that persons life changed after receiving a blanket.  Its nice to know that you make a difference in the world sometimes.  talked with my sister last night on the phone...conversation seems a little thin these days.  I'm not sure what has gone awry, but we have trouble finding things to talk about.  Maybe it is the vast distance between us...4000miles has a way of doing that to a sibling relationship I guess.  Her son is 3.5 years old and I haven't seen him since he was just a baby.  She has another child who is nearly 2 whom I have never met, and she is having another in June.  I looked at plane tickets to go and visit her, but it is a clear fortune, even with all the cheap airlines.  Nearly $1000 just to fly in my own country, which is ridiculous.  I can fly to Guatemala for cheaper than that.    haven't written much on the other blog...not much happening there as I await my damned tax return.  I am beginning to think I just won't get it.  In fact, I have convinced myself that I won't get it and we are not going to central america next month.  bwahhhh....

       Winter Doldrums   yes, they are here.  I am not the subject of them, but the resident teenager is...she went on quite a tantrum this morning that erupted out of very little...I hate this town, I am bored, I hate this town, I hate winter, I hate walking around in this town, I am bored...you get the picture.  I don't know what to say to her.  I hate this town too, and I hate walking around in this town.  The sidewalks are a joke...if they even bother to plow them.  And in the summer, you are lucky to find a sidewalk, and then lucky of you don't crack an ankle on the uneven slabs of concrete jutting up everywhere.  I think she is just have the winter doldrums, the winter blues, getting shackwhacky.  The big problem is that she is finished school, so has lost a great source of peer relationships.  While she was only to glad to be finished with school, now she has hours and hours of time to rattle around the house.  She works about 30-35 hours a week, but during the rest of it, she is often left here alone as Brad is still in school and I am at work.  We are going on our trip in a month, we hope, so that will break up the time for her, but until then, I think we are in for a few more tantrums...  I am on training today and tomorrow for Street Smart, which is non-violent crisis intervention.  I am semi-enjoying myself, but I don't do well when someone is up front, just reading off something that I have in front of me.  I like the interaction much better.  And then my mind wanders to work, and all the stuff I should be doing at work...or I begin to doze off...hasn't really happened yet as they do have us up and down a fair bit, but I am famous for this.  I dozed through most of university...imagine the grades I could have attained had I been awake!  I return to on-call this Thursday for a week, then I am off a week and on once again.  I hope for some hours, as I can sure use the money...it is a never ending money pit here in the house...where does it all go???  Question of the century, I know.  well, the EX is tucked safely away in our house in Grand Bruit.  Lets hope he stays there for a while.  With any luck, his family will explain to him the merits of leaving SB.  I hope he is not making a mess of our house!  I had supper with my aunt and uncle last night...a lovely dish of pasta with fresh rolls, and a glass of red wine.  It was nice to sit down at someone else's table for a change...I think I know how Amber feels...I am just tired of this house!  Perhaps we should switch some furniture around tonight...that's my project for the night...they will both be at work so won't be in my way...see if that cheers her up at all.  She is off tomorrow too, so perhaps we can go and do something different, get out of town.

        The Incredible Life of My Ex-Husband    Here is a list of the incredible things that supposedly have happened to my ex-husband and whats her name.  They are kind of in order, but so much has happened, it is hard to keep track.  I will use abbreviations for them as follows - exhusband is EX and whats her face is SB (stupid bitch)  1. SB is going to be a millionaire.  We heard right from the beginning of the relationship about this huge settlement she is supposed to get, first it was $3.5 million, then it was $4 million.  She had apparently been in some bus accident the previous year.   2. EX and SB are backing out of driveway and car is hit by motorcycle 3. EX promises to give resident teenagar one of SB's cars, an old one, but it must be put in for repairs first - minor stuff like brakes, and shocks.  The process apparently takes 3 incredible months, and they must change garages twice.  Then the kicker comes.  On the very day they are to pick up the car from the mechanic, the car accidentally falls down on the mechanic and kills him.  We are devastated to hear this, and decided the accident is not a good omen and I do not want my daughter to have the car.  Then I get suspicious and check the papers and with police...this event did not happen.  some weeks later, SB sells the car to a family member. 4.  Their car is stolen.  They buy a shitbox for about $300 with no rear window, just plastic; no cover for the gastank, and it is about 30 years old (a tank)  The previous car is returned and then stolen about 3 times, with the last time being by someone who spirited away to New Brunswick and used the car in another crime, so now the car is evidence when they find it and they can't get it back for many months. 5. They are going to buy a house together with her big bucks - we hear this in the summer, with plans of moving into a new home for December.  This and that happens and before we know it, they have moved into a new apartment in a nice area, where rent is $1200/month.  Well that sounds great!  Two months later, they are out on their asses.  They move into a DUMP in the projects.  - we hear that the contractor they were supposed to get their house built by has run off with their deposit, and they are working to get it back. 6. The gas is siphoned out of their car continuously, they have crack whores showing up at their door looking for money, dope, alcohol, cigarettes, etc.  The DUMP they have moved to has all the windows boarded up on the first floor.   Then comes word that they are leaving the DUMP to move into a fairly decent rental house. 7. They leave the DUMP and move into a rental house for the summer.  no explanation why, but the house seems somewhat better. 8. Their home is broken into and trashed, and a $20,000 cheque is stolen from the home.  Who in the hell keeps a $20,000 cheque in their home???  And who has one???  Also missing is some money from EX's bank account. 9. I find out about SB's criminal record and call EX to tell  him.  He doesn't believe me even though I hear it from the police and courts, with whom I work each day.  So he doesn't confront her. 10.  They are evicted from the rental house and head to a motel. 11. They supposedly buy a house and plan to move in, but the owner is still there and is unable to leave the home as planned due to a brain tumor or something and she cannot move.  Closing date is pushed back again and again, until the house idea just disintegrates.  They begin talking about a piece of land where they are going to build a house. 11. They leave the motel and head to a trailer in the middle of nowhere and commute over an hour to get EX to job. 12. They supposedly buy a piece of land and pay a contractor to build them a house.  This process is delayed and delayed until we hear that the contractor has run off with their money, AGAIN.  Except it is more than the standard 5-10% deposit, but a whopping $120,000.  What idiot gives a contractor that much... 13.  They move out of the trailer and into a series of motels. 14. They buy a brand new truck.  Then they don't have the truck.  Then they are driving their old car.  Then they have another brand new truck. 15.  They supposedly find another contractor who will build them a house in 60 days or its free.  The construction begins late, and something happens...the house disappears and they are looking at something else. 16. They are buying a brand new already built home in a new subdivision.  I actually take Amber there to see the house on a day visit.  The house looks nice...could it be true.  NOT.  Some convoluted argument with the contractor over the house.  They decide to buy the one across the street.  Then that deal evaporates. 16. They move into a house from the motels.  They are supposedly there until August.  Two months into it, they are evicted.  Story is that they must come up with $9,000 in rent in order to stay. They don't and move to yet another apartment.    What a crock of shit.  There is probably more that I am forgetting.  Now EX has moved to NL for the month...if only his family can convince him to leave SB.  He lived such a boring, dull existence before he met her.  I see only evil in her, and she is planning on bringing him down to the depths of hell with her.  I have not allowed the resident teen to stay with them after finding out about the criminal record.  She is permitted to see father, but not to be around SB.  And so that is the story of my ex-husband.  He was a very normal law abiding guy before she met him.  We lived in the same house for years, and OWNED it, and still do!   what will we hear next...

      Rain, rain and more rain.  I love it.  Going with the rain, down the drain, is all that hateful snow.  It makes for slippery conditions, but a minor and temporary inconvenience.  Missed my night to go out to play Rummoli last night...all those nickel were idol in my jar.  I was called out by the duty worker to go out on a call, so instead of potentially making $10-15 at Rummoli in nickels, I made over $80 at work, heh heh...sounds like a good deal to me!  However, I did miss the food at the Rummoli game, and now I have 8 boiled eggs in my fridge that I had planned on making devilled eggs with for the gang.  I'll have to figure out what to do with them now.  My exhusband is back in our old home in Newfoundland.  I wish he would stay there.  The alternative is returning to his "partner" in Halifax - a crooked old bag who will drag him down.  Did that sound nasty?  Good, because it was meant to be.  He is acting so stupid about it.  She has a criminal record, and I have told him this and it doesn't faze him.  She has 20 or so counts of fraud, theft, etc, and has been taking him for a ride these past two years.  I just have to list some of the ridiculous behaviour we have heard from them here, as it is quite incredulous.  Be prepared for a long entry...

      Here it is, March 4th and not an entry for the month!  Shameful.  I have been busy though...made a trip to North Sydney on Tuesday night to return a young offender to Newfoundland...we got enough of 'em here...she had to go home...lol.  She wanted to anyhow, but not after telling me something I found very incredible and shallow.  While in our province, she was with some friends who had "taken a car without permission" and while they were in a high speed chase across the highway followed by several mounties, she is climbing into the back seat complaining she cannot get arrested in what she is wearing, so changed her outfit.  incredible.  my reply to that was that dear, you could have been wearing asphalt and blood had your friend lost control of the car during the chase...this did not appear to phase her.  silly girl.  the resident teenager heard from her third university application...acceptance!  So to recap, she has gotten into St. Francis Xavier (ST FX), Saint Mary's, and Dalhousie.  Saint Mary's has already offered her a $2000 scholarship, while the other two have not announced anything yet.  Whoo hoo Amber!  Way to go!  Now comes the task of sorting out where to go, but we are both leaning towards St. Mary's as we have heard only good things about it.  We are travelling up to Halifax on the 15th to check it out at their Open House.  Drove to Antigonish yesterday to drop off the DAMN tv once again.  This is the tv I bought at Future Shop a couple of years ago and in early January, it pooped out on us...no picture, and then a loud screeching noise like it was going to blow up.  So thankfully I have the extended warranty, good until 2006!  The only drawback is that the authorized repair shop is in Antigonish, 40 minutes away and his business hours are about the same as mine, with no evening hours, or weekend hours.  This means I must take time off work to bring the tv over.  So in January, I brought it over on a rare day off and was promised it would be fixed the following week.  Great!  Except it wasn't fixed for another month.  Then came the task of getting over to pick it up with his limited hours, and with a dozen storms interfering with this, it wasn't easy.  I finally got the tv back last week only to discover that it doesn't work.  DAMN.  So comes the task of getting this damn thing back over there again.  So I called him, not much flexibility on the hours, so I have to book off an hour from work in order to drag this over there.  May I mention that it is a 25inch tv, so I cannot really lift it myself and must have Brad put it in my car.  So Monday, I get him to do just that...except I don't get to go over on Monday due to work being busy and I can't take the time off.  Then Tuesday comes...I am on my way to North Sydney, the opposite direction...Wednesday comes, and FINALLY,  I can get to Antigonish to get this tv out of my car.  I had visions of coming to a sudden stop and getting rear ended by a television.  I wonder how long he will keep it this time.  So about the telethon I worked for last weekend...we raised over $16,000, which is great!  Some of the proceeds go to the Big Brothers/Big Sisters in the Strait area as well.   I did have one interesting call...since we were using the regular lines at Children's Aid/Community Services, I had a call from someone who wanted to know "if the welfare office is open" so I asked him if he was planning on donating his cheque...then told him no, the office is not open.  No new snow this week, and actually received a great deal of rain, making for some flooding in areas, but as long as there is no new snow, I'm happy.  There is however, lots of ice and my driveway is a skating ring.  Well, time to get myself ready for work and see who's life I can screw up, I mean help out today. (joking, people!)

      pouring rain and chilly here today...can't wait to leave it all behind!  At least it is rain and not snow, and I hope that all the snow is gone by the time we get back on May 10th.  They may even be cutting the grass...  My friend Kara is also going on a trip...her blog can be found at  urlLink Kara Kwest .  She is headed to Spain and possibly parts beyond.  We are leaving tomorrow for Belize and parts beyond, so be sure to check in on my other blog -  urlLink Central American Quest   I hope to also post pictures here with the digital camera -  urlLink Jude's Photo Barn  You can also check out pics from past vacations here too.

       The Job Interview   Well holy cow...I got a call AND an e-mail about a job interview for the North West Territories!!!  The job is in Norman Wells, a small community on the Mackenzie River.  That would be WONDERFUL!!!  I am waiting to hear back from them.  They want to know if I am available for interview on April 21st at 1:15pm, but I will be away in Central America, so I am hoping they can interview later, as I don't know if I can depend on the phone system in central america.  But holy COW!  I was so excited...

      turkey day...time to open up a fresh wound while christening the new food chopper...OUCH.  I probably need stitches, but I'll be damned if I spend Easter Monday at the ER, waiting for hours.  So a tightly wrapped bandaid will have to do.  It is right on the fleshy pad of my middle finger of my right hand...GREAT.  So I awoke the charming resident teen and enlisted her to help get the bird in the oven, which she graciously did.    Now I have to finish tidying the house for the afternoon guests :-) and dye some eggs for decor...

       Happy Easter   Easter morning...I remember when it used to be that Amber got up early in the morning to look for easter eggs (jelly beans) that the "easter bunny" had hidden all over.  now they were fast asleep when I got up...no excitement there...but then they got up and we had an easter "conference" in the dining room - chocolate and gifts were exchanged - yummy! Tehre were stuffed bunnies, bubble blowers, snow globe, and tons of chocolate.  We had fresh baked cinnamon buns (straight from the can, lol) for breakfast, and settled in to watch some home video.  Seems fairly nice out...might even drag myself out for another walk - not like the one from Friday actually happened...

       Good Friday   Yes, it is good, and it is Friday, because I don't have to work and I am getting paid for it.  I have been up for a bit today, busy with e-mail, and checking out a website that people from one of my old high schools have set up - Stephenville Integrated High School.  Check out their site and if you actually went there, perhaps you would like to join -  urlLink Integrated High   Kind of a sunny day...I may even drag my ass out for a walk later today, if the stench from the plant/mill are not too bad.  Tip for future residence...check out whether or not you are downwind from industrial area...  the younguns are still sleeping...will soon be time to begin morning WAKEUP call...heh heh...

      well, the snow in my driveway is low enough to drive over now.  We had only cleared enough snow to park two cars instead of three as it was just too much snow, and the pile grew to about 7 feet...now it is mere inches and I am excited...it should be clear by tomorrow evening!  I parked on top of it tonight, hoping the heat from the car would melt it somewhat.  The yard is nearly clear, just a foot or so in the back and nearly the same in front.  There are flurries flying now, but nothing to worry about.  went shopping last night and bought the cutest little electric chopper for about $9 at Wal-Mart.  I melted the food holder on the stove of my last one, and had e-mailed Black and Decker about it, to no avail...no one even bothered to answer my email.  It likely would have cost me a fortune for the replacement piece anyhow.  No more garlicy onion hands!!!  The resident teenager also bought one for her upcoming move out plan...which, I might add, brings me to my next topic...   Moving Out   It cannot happen soon enough.  Earlier this year I was all worried about the whole empty nest thing, and having a tough time with it...yeah, I'm over that...I am SO over that.  It is time for this little munchkin to move on and experience the world.  I know I will still miss her, but she has become so dependant on me...doesn't eat most of the day after spending it lounging around the house, and then pounces on me when I come through the door - what's for supper...charming little thing...I show her the fridge and all the items in there that SHE can cook with.  I am pooped when I get home and the last thing I want to do is COOK.  I do manage once or twice throughout the work week, and usually a couple of times on the weekend, but other than that...she must fend for herself.  And today was no exception...I cooked last night (homemade pizza) so tonight was not her night....I show her the fridge again.  Chores, now THAT'S a nasty topic...they seem to be near non-existent in this dear child's memory, and nearly distant in the memory of the boyfriend.  He manages to clean the dishes 3-4 times a week, but usually not without prompting...grumble, grumble says I.  I don't ask for much, just the dishes done each day from the boyfriend, and from the resident teenager, vacuum once a week, clean the bathroom once a week, and an occasional miscellaneous chore...it is more of a chore to get her to do it, no matter how I phrase it.    Noise at night...lets see...resident teenager gets off work close to midnight, and the boyfriend gets off work at midnight...what might this result in?  You got it...two wound up teenagers late at night...laughing, watching television, carrying on, talking, in and out of the bedrooms, bathroom, up and down the stairs... ARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH   Then there are the dishes that are left all around...been a problem for several years and has never gotten better...  yup - I am so over the empty nest thing...is it July yet???

      more rain...and boy is the snow going fast!  I am wearing sandals today to coax out the sun later though.    still no tax refund from revenue canada, although I know now that they are not holding money back from me as I received my GST rebate today.  I just don't know what is taking them so long.  We are to leave for central america in 10 days and I don't have a nickel for the trip yet!!!  I have convinced myself we aren't going to be able to go, and then if I get the money, it will be a surprise.  Actually, if I don't have it by the weekend, I'm afraid we will have to reschedule the trip, perhaps to mid-May - early June.  I have a co-worker who is gone from the 9th-15th or so of May, so I couldn't go until after that.  this sucks.  so much for filing early...on Friday it will have been 2 months since I filed...what a crock.  I should have paper filed, and then they would have had what they needed right away.    well, my weekend of sloth is over...I did barely anything this weekend, but sit around and watch movies, read, or sleep.  I did manage to tidy the basement a little, but there is still the huge task of readying for the yard sale in May/June.  I am selling piles of stuff, as I refuse to pack all this crap again.  Most of what is in the basement is either going in the yard sale, or is empty boxes.  I just hope for a nice Saturday, with no rain, as there is a whole lotta stuff.  I am up early this morning, and refuse to go to work this early!!!  They get enough of my free time as it is, with me not taking hardly any coffee breaks, and working through lunch when on the road.    Wonder if I will hear about those northern jobs this week???

      rain today, but I am fine with that...it is taking the snow...I can see the grass in my yard...mind you it is skirted by about 4 feet of snow, but it is grass, none the less...soon I will see robins!  And better yet, the times go ahead tonight at midnight...whoo hoo!  Longer days, I can handle that...  I applied for three different jobs in the North West Territories yesterday...the pay is awesome and I think it would be quite a learning experience to live that far north.  I have lived in Labrador, so know some idea of the cold and snow, and I have lived in Grand Bruit, so have some idea of the isolation...bring it on!  I think as long as I have a sattelite dish and internet on my computer, I will be just FINE!  I can live anywhere for a year or two if it means getting rid of my student loan debt!!!  My friend Kathleen is also looking up north, so it might be cool if we both get jobs up there at the same time.  We had thought about driving up, but it is probably 7000 kms or more...little more than I want to do on my own right now, and we would both need our cars, so couldn't travel together.    big excitement this weekend...I will be watching movies and knitting on my blanket...whoo hoo!  But honestly, I need the rest.  Its been a busy week, and I had a few calls on duty to go out on, so need to take it easy and relax.    Got some actual exercise today - let the resident teenager take the car to work, so I walked to my office for a few papers I needed, then walked to Sobeys for some groceries...its pissing rain, but I was dressed for it.  I haven't walked anywhere in ages.  Funny how places that seem close in the summer seem too far away in winter.  Of course, I saw a special on meat while at Sobey so bought extra and packed it in my backpack...what felt reasonable when I left Sobeys felt like a quarter of moose by the time I got home...but I made it nonetheless and I feel better for having gotten some exercise, even if it was just a short walk.  I will be glad though, when the snow is gone and I can actually walk on the sidewalks again, so I do not fear losing my life to the logging trucks that thunder by me on the road...  The b/f of resident teen is out shopping today, buying up stuff for their new apartment that they have yet to rent.  They are so excited about furnishing it...I can understand that.  I remember my first place and how excited I was, but so very poor at the time.  It will be nice to go and visit them when they move out.    I should look at rentals in NWT, as I hear they are quite pricey...I only need a room and a bathroom though, a little kitchenette...just fine with me.

      Another long day...work, then off to Antigonish for an appointment - turns out I have asthma...guess that's why I nearly expired on the volcano in Guatemala...heh heh.  The doc actually told me it was very dangerous to have such an attack so far from hospital, and no emergency puffer.  So I left armed with two prescriptions and a promise to carry the emergency one with me at all times.  Sure would have helped me out on the volcano, I tell ya.  Amber and I visited a friend of hers who is in the hospital getting treatments for cancer.  The friend is from A & W, and Amber misses her quite a bit, so wanted to visit.  She brought her candy, flowers and some Downhomer magazines.  Amber made an odd comment though that I hadn't realized before...she had never been to visit anyone in the hospital before.  She had surely been as a patient a number of times, especially to outpatients, but could not remember visiting anyone.  I reminded her that she did visit me when she was just 2 years old, but of course, would not remember that.  She was a little nervous, but I told her just to chat it up with this friend like she always did and enjoy the visit.  The friend was likely glad to not have to talk about her illness for a change.  Was out to my friend Kathleen's house tonight.  She finally had the opportunity to speak to her landlord about the possibility of me moving into her rental house.  So when I got there, they stopped over for the "Interview".  It was a little awkward, but we muddled through.  They will let me know tomorrow.  I think they were just surprised as they didn't know she was even looking for work elsewhere - it had been a low-key effort.  So, I will hear tomorrow whether or not I get to finally move out of this noisy town.  Either way, Cibele will move in with me next month, and if I have to stay here, I will just keep looking over the summer for another place.  Another busy week...with a fine ending - we have the agency picnic at Whale Cove this Friday.  It is an afternoon and overnight adventure, complete with cabins, bbq and games.  I went last year and had great fun, so it should be good this year as well.  And then Sunday is the 18th birthday for the resident teen...HOLY COW.  I am cooking a turkey for she and her friends, and I have to go in this week and order an ice cream cake for her.  Brad is going to make some cookies.  Should be good fun!  Now it is off to bed with me...and some reading in my latest novel - No Great Mischief by Alistair MacLeod.  It is interesting thus far...

       The Great White North   That's the title of my friend Kathleen's new blog.  As you know, she is moving up north and she wanted to blog, so I set one up for her and I hope she posts regularly so we can all live vicariously through her although I will not envy the COLD and DARK winter.  Look here for new postings, although I wouldn't expect anything until late June or early July when she actually arrives there.   urlLink The Great White North

      so I tried to listen to Kool FM and the only player available to listen to it is a TRIAL version they link to their site.  rats...I thought I could just listen with Windows Media Player or something like that.  if anyone knows how I can configure my own, just let me know.    I had a couple of days in Halifax, just got back last night.  I had a training session for work on "Brief Therapy with Adolescents" which was quite helpful, but would have been more so if I actually did therapy with anyone.  I only see people a few times, normally, and them move them on to others.  But useful just the same.  I have found though, that I tend to nod off when someone else talks for more than five minutes, so on the first day, I had a terrible time with the ol' head bob, back and forth...yikes.  And it wasn't that he wasn't interesting either.  So I brought my knitting the next day and was just fine.  You laugh, but I tell you, I began bringing it in my last few months of my BSW degree and it made a world of difference.  Instead of nodding off and sleeping through the lectures, I was actually able to pay attention.  Thankfully for the other participants, I am not a noisy knitter - no clitcky clacking from me, heh heh.  Got some shopping done, and bought a present for the resident teen - her 18th birthday is in one week...YIKES!  I also bought a birthday card and father's day card...you know you have the right card picked out when you start cying in the card store...its so sad, really...and embarrassing.  I have begun a new novel after getting halfway through Sybil again and realized it wasn't what I wanted to read.  Now I have begun Alistair McLeod's  No Great Mischief  so we will see how that goes.  I also have a few others on the go in my reading pile on top of my nightstand -  The Bonesetter's Daughter  by Amy Tan,  On South Mountain  about the Goler Clan, and one about the Dalai Lama and living a better life.  There is likely a magazine or two there too.  Went to lunch with my friend who is moving up north...she has just 3 weeks left on this coast and then she heads to Inuvik...BRRRR...can't believe I was considering it myself!  Now I am quite comfortable with my decision to stay, and excited for hers to move.  Especially if I get to move into her house in the country...heh heh.  Then my co-worker Cibele will be moving in with me and the resident teen will be moving OUT.  We are going to Halifax again next week to do a little apartment hunting with she and the boyfriend.  That and look for a prom gown...leaving it a little late for the prom gown, I know, but perhaps we'll get a deal.    now I hear the couch calling me for a nap...here Jude, come here...

        The Fate of Sponge Bob Square Pants    Well, although he fought the good fight to move on to a better life, poor Bob has been kicked to the curb, literally.  He was auctioned off on e-bay and fetched a handsome price of $12.50US, but then when it came time for shipping, and he was taken out to the post office today, the shipping rates proved to be too much for the bidder to endure at nearly $50.  The bidder was let out of his contract, and I had to bag up Bob and take him to the curb for spring trash pick-up sometime this month.  Poor guy.  Who knew his life would end like this...

       grad photo day   Well, we finally did it...the planets were finally all lined up and we took the plunge and went to get the resident teen's graduation photos done.  We began at Wal-Mart where we had hoped to get them done...turns out our local Wal-Mart does not carry the gown for the local high school.  WTF?  There are only three high schools in the two counties and they don't actually carry any of their colors.  But yet they have a big advertisement for doing graduation photos...whatever for???  So after I pitched an embarassing hissy fit, we left and went to Bob Martin Photos and paid $30 for 12 proofs/poses.  We have to then pay $25/sheet which is 1-8x10, or 2-5x7, 4-4x5, etc.  Quite a difference from the $3.95 I was going to pay at Wal-Mart.  They will get a stern letter from me...  So off we went to Bob Martin's and he was gracious enough to see how frustrated we were since we had taken months to get hair, makeup, absence of zits, schedules, time and so on all together.  She dyed her hair yesterday so it was freshly colored for the pic...minus that little smudge of dye on her left cheek...can't see it in the photo, honest!  Surprisingly enough, the photos were taken at noon and ready for 3pm.  So I picked them up after work and Brad and I browsed the photos at home.  The resident teen is at work, so has not seen them yet.  There is a really nice one of her in the grad gown and another really nice one in her regular clothes.  He took some of each and one of the both of us, but I don't particularly like the one with me in it...my planets were not lined up...  I had my B & W film developed today too, but I was not so impressed with them.  It wasn't Bob's fault, but the fault of a crappy camera and not so interesting subject matter in central america.  I guess the Roman ruins look better in black and white.  We didn't see that many in CA, so there are just a few pics that are frameworthy.  Oh well...I have some really nice color pics that I will check out getting enlarged to 5 x 7 I guess.  My friend got a job up north, just the one she had been after for big money.  Congrats!!  When can I move into your house???  heh heh...I am hoping she will talk to her landlord early this week and let me know, one way or the other.  If not, I am not homeless and Cibele will move in here with me next month when the resident teen and her man move out.  We are going up to Halifax in two weeks to find those crazy kids an apartment, and take himself around to look for a job.  I am still recovering from the busy weekend...but can't go to bed early as I have to wait for the resident teen to get home and critique her pics or I won't hear the end of it, heh heh.  If anyone wants to take a peek, just e-mail me or leave a comment and I can send it to you (family and friends only though).    I have to go to Halifax tomorrow afternoon - have two days training in Halifax so I have booked into the Cambridge Suites which is a pretty nice hotel.  Will be nice to have some quiet alone time I guess, although I find staying in hotels rather lonely these days.  Too bad someone else wasn't coming from work.  I think my office mate is coming,  but he is likely staying at his own house as he has a house just outside Halifax.  Training is just more fun when there are two or more of you staying in the hotel together.    Ok, my contacts are about an hour past expiry for the day, so must run...later.

      Another succcessful girls day.  We ate, we drank, we did very little crafts, we watched a few good movies and oh boy, did we laugh!  The movies we watched were Thirteen, AGAIN, because a couple of the gals hadn't seen it before.  Its a great movie, which is why I bought it.  We then watched Scary Movie 3.  If you haven't seen any of them, rent them now, they are hilarious.  The catch is, you have to have watched at least some of the horror movies that they refer to for it to make any semblance of sense.  My favorite part in # 3 has to be the scene with the teacher after someone throws crayons at the door...I just ROARED.  We need more teachers like that.   We then watched My Life Without Me, starring Sarah Polley.  What an awesome movie.  Sad, but a very honest portrayal that was not all sap and drama, just a real story.  I would highly recommend it.    We had another movie to watch but were too tired to bother, so just Kara stayed over and we headed off to bed after I finished bidding on a movie - St. Elmo's Fire, one of my favorites!  The movie we didn't watch, I watched later today - The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer.  It was a half-decent scary movie.  Good plot, and no gore at all, just psychological stuff.  Now I have to go rinse the purple dye out of my hair...bleached out and redyed today for a fresh new purple.  then it will be NAP TIME.  Gawd, I need a vacation to get over my holiday weekend.

       6th Monthly Girls Day   Well, its here, 6th Monthly Girls Day.  We are starting a little later today as it is a holiday tomorrow.  I told the gals to come about 3-4pm and we will bbq supper later.  Snacks, crafts, liquor, movies and comfy clothes are the order of the day and NO WORK TALK.  I have a sign on my fridge that we are not working today and must not discuss work as most of my friends are social workers that I work with.  It is a good rule and we are pretty good at adhering to it.  Although sometimes I am the culprit.    I have to go find the movie Cold Creek Manor and since the resident teen has the car, if Big Al's Video doesn't have it behind me here, then I guess we don't get it, lol.    Brad has offered to entertain us, but I am not sure in which manner...heh heh, just kididng.

       Yard Sale a Rousing Success   Well, its over...the hugest purge I have ever done.  And I am $250 richer for it, YAHOO!  Things went quite well, and what was left was either moved to the spring garbage pile at the corner of my yard for pick-up, or taken to the local women's shelter (clothes and household items), and I dropped off a huge pile of books for the second hand bookstore for either credit/money.  I only brought just a few things back into my house that I either was unable to sell, and a few pieces of Tupperware I couldn't "give" away.  One lady asked me how come my prices were so expensive for the Tupperware.  Now this Tupperware is not your mother's old white and avacado or orange tupperware that smells like rotting plastic, this was relatively new stuff in mint condition, and I had a price of $5 on a container that is priced at $20 in the catalogue.  So I politely told her that and that Tupperware has a lifetime guarantee regardless of owner.  Still didn't budge, so I told her if she wanted to pay a dollar for a container, she should go to the dollar store and buy brand new Sterilite instead, because I wasn't giving away my Tupperware for a dollar.  She ended up buying one instead of two, so it wasn't a total loss.  Now, of course I didn't have that attitude about pretty near anything else, but since I was a Tupperware "consultant" for a number of years, I am quite partial to it, ha ha.  We had others selling with us - a friend of Amber's was there and had a whole table of stuff of her own, as well as two friends of mine brought some of their stuff to fill a table and a half.  It was busy, that's for sure!  People were coming by (as usual) as we were setting up, rooting around and asking questions.  We also had a lot of "drive bys", you know the kind and you likely do it yourself - you're driving by, slow down as you pass the house and decide whether or not there is anything there worth stopping for, and whether or not you really want to get out of the car, because its kind of cold, and then step on the gas and head out.  We had a ton of kids come over, and they are Amber's usual customers as she clears her room of childhood things to make way for grownup stuff.  There were two kids who came back about four times, and left with a shopping bag full each time.  Their mother's will surely kill them, or come looking for us!  Amber sold her bike, which was the main thing as it has just been collecting dust for years.  We served coffee, juice and cookies, which were a big hit, especially with it being so frigid out early in the morning.  I was FROZEN.  which in itself is unusual as I rarely find it cold.  And in spite of the cold, most of us sellers got sunburns, on our faces of course as no other skin was exposed.  I managed to buy a few things myself from other sellers...books, a scrabble game (yeee haw!) and a picture frame.  Following the sale, I also went out and bought a few new things that were definitely a splurge, but that has always been my one rule - when I have a yard sale, I must buy something nice for myself.  I don't have to spend it all, but there must be at least one nice thing coming back into the house.  So I bought four.  I bought a mattress foam - you know the kind that they talk about mattresses being made of on TV like NASA stuff, where you put your hand in and it keeps the shape of your hand.  This is a two inch thick piece for the top of my mattress.  And boy did I sleep well last night...granted, it was likely exhaustion induced from a BUSY week, but I don't have sore joints today like I often do.  I also bought a new pillow (who doesn't like a new pillow once in a while), a wooden and cloth magazine rack and my favorite purchase - a new polished steel lamp.  I had sold my set of dusty rose (ick) lamps and needed at least one new one to replace it.  I bought a white linen shade to go with it and it looks very smart in the living room.  I didn't spend all my money, but feel happy enough about the money and the purge.  I got rid of SO MUCH STUFF.  Now comes the time to clean up...cleaned up most of the upstairs last night, but the basement is a bit scattered since I had been going through boxes to find things to sell or put in the garbage.  Now I have to pack up the boxes again and settle things away.  Phew!

      well holy cow...someone bid on my Sponge Bob Square Pants costume!  I did it as a joke and now someone actually wants it...very strange!  But now I have to figure out shipping costs and how in the heck I am going to ship it!!!  The buyer pays, so it won't cost me anything, but I think it is hilarious what you can sell on there.  If it didn't go in the auction, I was going to sell it in the yard sale on Saturday, lol.  Which by the way, things are coming along nicely.  I purged my cupboards and took out a ton of Tupperware for the sale, and I hope people aren't expecting to get it for nothing, as Tupperware is expensive and has a lifetime warranty (spoken like an ex-representative, heh heh).  I earned every piece of that.  The resident teen priced all of her stuff today too, so we are nearly ready.  I have to make some signs tomorrow evening because I forgot to get some bristol board and we should be set.  I might have buyers for some stuff already which is GOOD.  But now I am too tired to stay up any longer, so off to bed I go.

      Sunny day again, that's lovely.  Wish it would warm up a little, but I am not complaining.  It was downright hot on Saturday and I got some sun, including a sunburn on the legs.    Nearly ripped my toe off on my treadmill...got cocky and didn't hold the handlebars, as I was reading and my toe slid back to the right and hooked in SOMETHING rather unpleasant...all I know is there is a flap of skin on my little toe trying to grow back.  But it has not disuaded me from using it...been pretty good actually and used the treadmill nearly every single day since I bought it.  Sleepless night last night...I haven't slept well since returning from my trip, which is typical, but last night was the longest ever.  I had a rough day at work yesterday with a child apprehension, which is never easy.  I probably wouldn't have slept anyhow, as I usually spend the night replaying in my mind the events of the day, how the mother reacted, and the look on the child's face.  Thank goodness I don't do that sort of thing very often or it would burn a person out.  Went out last night to my friend's house who I hope to rent next month for a look.  Resident teenager was late in bringing my car back, so I didn't get out in time to get a picture of the outside of the house, and then I kind of forgot about pics on the inside.  My friend is not a tidy person...enough said.  But I could look through her clutter and furballs (two long hair cats...) and envision my things in her house.  It is much more roomy than mine, and the location is perfect.  It was just a mere 15 kms from town.  There are some needed repairs/things to be done, but nothing drastic...doorbell needs replacing, tons of lightbulbs burnt out (that would drive me nuts - doesn't bother her), move out the old laundry pair to make way for my new set I bought when I got my job here, get the dishwasher cleaned (don't know how that works, but she claims it needs cleaning - I am thinking there is a food trap somewhere or something), get cables run to two other rooms and phone cords to two other rooms (jobs for my dad, the cables and phone things). So not a whole lot.  The basement is huge and has cold storage too and a laundry chute from upstairs!  Although I am not sure about throwing my laundry down there...seems to be an abundance of bugs/flies...they might crawl through it.  My friend has yet ANOTHER job interview, so something is gonna happen for her, and she will likely have several job offers.  Then I have to give notice to my landlord, and get packing!  I have decided not to do a big pack job, but to just take my time and move one room per day if I can, and get a truck for one day to move all the big stuff.  That's the plan TODAY...who knows what might transpire as the time comes.  My friend hopes to be out by mid June, so I am hoping to be moving in by then, and completed by the end of the month.  The resident teen's graduation is at the end of the month - a week-long fiesta it seems.  There are three nights, only two of which I am invited to go, but will be expected to drive for the third.  They have the grad dinner, the prom and the grad party, all on different nights...and of course there is a party after the prom, so two late night parties in the same week.  I was chauffeur last year, so likely a repeat duty.  Of course, my parents will be coming during that week we hope, so that should be interesting - moving during a parental visit.  But they did it their whole lives as my dad was in the military, so it should be old hat for them...heh heh.  Don't worry mom and dad, won't make you work that much at all.  It should be mostly done by the time you get here.   Just a few jobs simple jobs for dad :-)  must go get ready for another day.

      Well, so much for being chilly.  It is actually very warm today!  Must be well over 20C...which is glorious!  I was out sunning myself earlier, but got a bit of a burn on my thighs, so had to come in.  I need something to lay one other than a towel so I can "flip over" to get the backs of my legs a little tanned.  My upper body is well tanned from my trip south, now I need legs to match.  I know what they say about sunning yourself, but I really don't care.  I like being tanned!  Simple as that!  My friend and co-worker Angela was by earlier today with her brand new kitty...she is a lovely longish hair tabby and white...and she phoned me just now to tell me what they named HER - Rupert!  can you imagine?  We are both Survivor fans, so that's where it came from.  The kitty is cute as ever, and will be expected to earn her keep at their new lodgings out in the country as there are mice in the area.  She is just 8 weeks old, so will have some time yet, but I imagine it won't be long before she bags her first kill.  According to Angela, she is getting along already with the resident dog, Brandy.  He is used to kitties I hear.  The resident teen and boyfriend were out in the yard today, goofing around...I was watching from the upstairs window as they attempted cartwheels, handstands, flips, somersaults, etc...it was quite humourous...I rememeber the day when my body would let me do that...  I don't recall if I mentioned it before, but I am considering a move this summer out of town, but not too far.  One possibility is to a friend's house in the country.  She is pursuing employment up north, so I am pursuing renting her house when she departs.  It is a nice 3-bedroom with a huge yard, and nice neighbors.  I have also asked another co-worker to move in with me and share expenses since I will have so much room.  The rent is less than I pay here, and I am hoping I will actually be able to tackle my student loans in earnest by sharing expenses.  The co-worker and I hope we are compatible to live with each other, so it should be an interesting summer.  The new house is not far from where Angela and kitty are living, so we can visit often!  NOW what can I get up to...I finished my book I was reading...

      yard sale, huh?  Not tomorrow...it is much to chilly around here.  And it is forecast to RAIN!  So I have decided to postpone my yard sale for a couple of weeks and try again then.  I might actually have my stuff ready by then too.  PROCRASTINATION.  TGIF - oh yeah, a full week back at work, what's that all about?  My job has been VERY busy, and getting busier.  Its mostly because my officemate is gone for the week, and I am having to do all of his work and mine too.  Hopefully he will be back next week and I can get back to my own stuff.    So Rupert got the second million bucks...good for him.  I think he deserved it.  He played the game so hard, and without lying to anyone and only got voted out because he was a threat to win the game, twice!  He looked so happy last night with his family, snotting and balling.  But what is up with Jerri - don't boo me, wahhh, wahhh, wahhh.  Then don't do evil things.  And Big Tom, he was "touched" to be on the final four...yeah, ok...touched in the head maybe.  What a goofball.  So now it's over and they have already filmed the next one, to air in the fall.  They are also taking applications for Survivor 10...great!  This Survivor fan will get another year out of Mark Burnett's efforts.  Next time there will be a pool again.  We missed out in this one because it was so different and we weren't sure how they were going to run the show, and eliminate contestants, so skipped it.  Now its back to normal.    Now its back to the real world of life and work...

      Well, I finally heard from the interview...I didn't get it, but some lucky aboriginal who invoked their right to affirmative action did.  Good for her I say.  She will fit right into that native community.  But, they mentioned that they had a number of other opportunities they wished for me to consider and interview for.  I gently turned them down, explaining my reasons for needed to stay in place for one more year.  They fully understood and advised me to contact them next year if I became interested once again.  Incidentally, though, they did have my co-worker's name on their list to call for a interview, so I was excited to hear that!    Then I got another call, just about the same thing - we have some opportunities coming up that we would like you to interview for.  When it rains it pours!  So again, I explained how I needed to stay home for at least one more year and that I would likely look at moving north next year.  She fully understood, and also had my co-worker's name on her list to call...eerie!  Sunny here today, but not so warm.  I am supposed to be getting things ready for the yard sale in two days...haven't done a thing, but better get hopping tonight.  The resident teen also has boxes of stuff, so will put her to work today also, pricing it.  Now I have to take my car in for repair, which is thankfully covered by insurance.  They want to replace the filter (which one, I don't know but will have to ask).  I will be glad to get rid of the buzzing muffler...the front gasket on the exhaust needs replacing.  I finally got my hands on a movie I have been in search of for many years - "Where the Spirit Lives" with Buffy Ste. Marie.  It was originally aired on CBC, and I have been looking for it all over, including CBC and e-bay.  Found it on e-bay a number of times but the auction always climbs up rather steeply to about $70-80US, so this particular time, perhaps the seller didn't recognize the value of the movie, but he listed it with a buy it now price of just $15.99, so I snapped it up!  Coincidence is, he lives here in Nova Scotia!  So it is bought and paid for and should arrive today or tomorrow.  Score!

      so Brad cooked supper for us tonight...it was delicious!  Broiled pork cutlets, rice, and potatoes.  Lots of starch, but I love it!  And THEN he did the dishes...who can complain about that?  He worked all day at his work experience, came home and cooked supper then did the dishes...he must feel like a wife by now!  I think he was even a little jealous of Amber who lounged around ALL day, doing nothing.  But then she works about the same amount of time as he does, just on different days and in the evenings.  He has all of his evenings off.  She worked all weekend, where he had it all to himself.  We shall see how the division of chores fares out when they move in together.  Day two back to work...great start...jumped out of bed, got dressed for work without looking outside in a short skirt and a tank top, thinking it would be nice out as the weather network said it would be on the net today...went downstairs and darn near froze...looked outside and it was pissing rain...could have done that first, but didn't...so back upstairs, changed outfit to long skirt and longsleeved sweater.  Just as well, when I got to work, my co-worker headed down to court on a subpoena and shortly after came racing back up only to tell me that they actually needed me, not her!  EEEK!  I hadn't read a thing, or prepared in any way for the trial!!!  So off I race to print off the case file and quickly skim the part they will surely ask me about, and thankfully I was dressed decently enough for court.  I wait ALL morning to go on the stand, only to get up there at 11:45am for about 5 minutes...sheesh...one of the hold-ups was truly classic...they needed a video camera or a converter to watch the evidence tape as it was only recorded on 8mm...and didn't have one.  They searched for about 20-30 minutes and when I asked what the problem was, I asked them politely why they didn't try the high school next door for one...they have their own TV lab, and the largest computer lab in the province, with tons of video equipment...oh really?  Guess who gets appointed to carry out this task...lol...So off I race to sign out a camera so the trial could continue...gawd I feel like I live in a hick town sometimes!!!    Another hot topic at work is our upcoming camping trip on the long weekend...it is still rather chilly and we are rethinking the whole idea as we don't want to freeze to death on the ground...so looking at cabins in which to camp instead, just for this trip and then as it warms up, tenting will be fine.  There is nothing like a night out in the country to begin the summer season!  here's to the continuing saga of getting my pictures...I haven't written about it because it is too ridiculous, but I am just pissed off now.  As you know, I was too cheap to put mine in the one hour photo, so dropped them in the cheaper option at Wal-mart where they send them away...didn't know that it was to HAMILTON, but anyway...I had specified what I wanted, which was 4x6 prints, matte finish and white borders...didn't know they didn't do white borders.  So I get a call last week, on Friday afternoon - we don't do white borders.  Ok I say, then just print them regular.  Ok she says, and tells me they won't be ready until about Tuesday since they came to customer service, it slowed them down and they have already shut down the processing lab today as it is late on Friday afternoon.  Ok says me...fine...whatever.   If that was only the end ...  Yesterday they call and tell me they can't do white borders...um, I tell them I have already talked to someone about this and understood they were going to just print them normally and I would have them tomorrow...oh, ok, I will make a note of that and let them know.  Duh, what did your coworker do last week then?   If that was only the end ...  Today I got another call...they can't do the white borders...ok, this is enough...I already told your company yesterday AND on Friday that it was okay, just print them without and send them back to me.  REALLY she says, I have no record that you spoke to anyone.  I am evil now.  I tell her if they are not back to Wal-Mart tomorrow, to just send the damn things back to me and I will take my business elsewhere.  I tell her that I have better things to do than to call their customer service desk and wait for 20 minutes to speak to them only to be told the same darn thing again and again.  I tell her that I will never use their service again.  She tells me she doesn't blame me and that she will make a note of my call.   Tomorrow shall be fun .  I am going to Wal-mart in person to pick up my photos.

      Survivor is over...boo hoo.  I can't believe those two went to the end...make me hurl.  What were the others thinking, even keeping Rob in the game???  They should have gotten rid of him weeks ago, and now little miss Amber Brkich took the million bucks and because she is marrying him, they will share it.  They are too sappy to even watch, but you do, just like a car wreck, you can't turn away.  Now CBS is going to give out another million bucks and everyone knows who will get it...Rupert!  His popularity has not waned, and when I voted this morning, it already was an overwhelming majority of people voting for Rupert to have the second million bucks.  Go Rupert!  And we get a bonus night of Survivor on Thursday night, wow.  Its back to work for me today...getting dressed up and all that jazz.  I have been rather slovenly this past week since my return home, and now I have to get with the program.  Stay tuned for more ramblings and useless musing...

      I just finished reading my book from Amber...what a wonderful little book!  It is called  Dear Mom, Thank you for Everything    by Bradley Trevor Freive...it is the cutest thing.  It is a collection of photos, mostly of animal babies and mothers with a story about thanking your mother for being there, for all sorts of things.  Just wonderful!  Thanks Amber, for the marvellous book!  She even made me breakfast, but lacking a tray, I went downstairs to eat it, which was fine with me!  Now I have done nothing else but call my own mother and lounge around all day...I have been soooo lazy since coming back from my trip!  I have to get moving soon though, and at least get my laundry done!  Tomorrow I head back to work.

      well that was a lovely evening with friends...got invited out to my friends Rob and Angela's new digs...they have moved into Rob's parents' house for a year while the parents travel on their sailboat.  We we ate and ate and ate bbq, and watched funny stuff on television.  Nice to have an evening out, thanks to Angela for rescuing me, and Brad, who also came along as the resident teenager was working til midnight tonight.    A GALE of wind today...I braved it to put some clothes out on the line...silly woman...it all blew off...my tablecloth was in the neighbor's tree.  But it was dry, so I can't complain too loudly!  If it wasn't for the wind, it would have been a nice day, but at times the gusts were wicked and blew dust and dirt all around in your eyes.  tomorrow is Mother's Day, but the resident youth in the home decided I should receive my gifts and cards today...Brad gave me a lovely bouquet of periwinkle blue hydrangeas, and Amber gave me a lovely book that I can't remember the name of, but is a funny book with drawings and things about being a child of your mother.  All that's left is breakfast in bed tomorrow morning!  My last day off tomorrow and then back to the grind...who knows what the week will hold for me...I'm sure you will hear about it here...

      the job search - it has temporarily ended...after much thought and conversation with Amber, I have decided not to pursue employment elsewhere for the time being.  I am moderately comfortable here, and feel that the timing is just not right for me, or for her.  She will move on to Halifax of course, but I will remain here in Port Hawkesbury until at least next spring.  I am just not up for a big change at the present...so friends and family can relax, or cry, whatever!    so I will be settling in for another year here, and with Amber and Brad moving out this summer, that will be enough change for me!  I will be having a yard sale on the 15th to clear out some clutter, and am looking forward to doing some local travel for the summer..camping and visiting family when I can.

      Alas, we have returned from the south!  I will post a few more on the Central American Blog, but I'm back here for regular drivel...  today is a day of chores...paying bills, checking the mail, getting groceries, getting film developed, dying my hair back from the awful color it turned in salt water, etc...I have only begun with my hair...once that is done, I am fit to go out in public, heh heh.  I have decided to keep my holidays for the rest of the week and just relax, get some stuff done around here and return to work on Monday, all refreshed.  Hope things are not too busy at work, so I don't feel guilty!  Sunny day here today, but not the heat of central america.  I will have to put pants and socks on, it looks like!  No more shorts for a while.  Lots to do, not much to blather on about this morning...

      Clean-up day –   The last day of the MOVING EXPERIENCE.  I headed into town early and began the task of cleaning the Hiram Street house…stove, fridge, kitchen, bathroom, and vacuum and mop the floors.  THEN came the basement…YIKES – what a mess of garbage…mostly cardboard, but what a mess.  I finally finished around 1:30pm, turned in the keys and before heading home remembered to stop and VOTE!!!    I flopped on the couch for 3 hours when arriving home, then finally summoned the energy to unpack the car and put everything away.  Boy, am I tired.  The crazy week is over though, and my roomie showed up tonight to move in.  I didn’t help her move her stuff in – I had spent my energy and she was okay with that, she just trucked it all into her room.  She decided to spend the night here after unpacking what she had as she was too tired.  I can relate to that.

       MOVING DAY – PART 2   Well, Saturday morning found us at the old house, packing the car and hoping Brad would arrange something for toting the rest to Halifax.  It was a trying day to say the least with arrangements falling through here and there, but by 1:30pm, Amber and I had arrived in Halifax and promptly called the landlord to let us in and we unloaded the car.  It was so hot in the stairwell, we thought we were going to expire – turns out the boiler is right beneath it…pant, pant…  After we unpacked what came in the car with us, we headed out to shop.  We finally heard from Brad again who was FINALLY under way with his uncle in a truck with most of their things.  Wal-Mart was an experience.  We get there, its crowded, but not so much we can’t get around.  Pick out a mop and broom, then head off to the vacuum cleaner department and after 20 minutes, pick one out…as we are picking one out, there is an alarm sounding…sounds like a fire alarm but no one is moving so we ignore it.  We are about ready to checkout when Wal-Mart staff goes aisle by aisle and directs everyone to leave the store immediately…so we did and went grocery shopping instead.  After the grocery shopping excursion, we went back to Wal-Mart, got what we needed again and managed to get in the WRONG checkout line.  We just got up to being next and the checkout gal left the stall…just LEFT.  She was gone about 20 minutes or more.  I don’t know where the heck she went.  She finally came back, no explanation and cheerily checked us out.  Whatever.  So then we finally get the heck out of Wal-Mart only to be stopped by the evil Wal-Mart greeter to check our stuff – WTF?  We didn’t even make the buzzer go off.  So we handed her the receipt and she let us pass.  Let’s get HOME!  We aren’t home long before Brad shows up with his truckload.  Amber called her dad up to help, who couldn’t leave the house without CB, but whatever…if she can carry anything, its less I have to drag up the stairs.  Brad is in a FINE mood by then, surly as I have ever seen him – but Amber and I are no fools…best approach, give him some space and he will get back to us when he is ready to interact civilly.  It didn’t take long…his uncle left, then Al and CB left, so I puttered around, made up the bed and they headed out to the balcony for some private chat.  By the time he came back in, he was in much better form and tackled the tasks at hand with cheer.  Brad put together the new furniture and Amber organized his CD collection while I washed the remaining dishes and put them away.    Then came the time to leave.  I had planned on staying there tonight but the couch didn’t make it in the first load, so I was heading out to my niece’s to sleep…and darn near got out the door until this lovely child of mine demanded tears from me…I had managed to construct a nice wall around them until now, denial was working well for me…then she spoke and proceeded to inform me of why I should be crying…it was too much.  I broke.  Sob, sob, sob…I finally left after about 20 hugs and kisses and reassurances from Brad that he will be good to her and cried all the way to my niece’s house.  I finally settled down shortly after arriving there and managed to hold it together for the rest of the evening.  Then I had to drive home in the morning.  I cried the whole way.  Just when I would stop and clear my head and eyes, I would start again.  And not just easy tears falling – HUGE GASPING SOBS.  My wall had come down.  The car is a nice place to cry…no one is watching, but my vision blurred many times, lol.  I found myself at my friend’s house in East Havre Boucher and stopped there for a hug – GAWD I needed one by that point.  And she did, and we cried together.  Then I finally got in control again, and sat and chatted with her for a couple of hours before heading home.  What an exhausting day.

       The Graduate   I watched you today as you stood on the stage And thought to myself, you've come of age. You're ready now to go out on you own And it hurt to see how the time has flown.  Where is that child of only three Who loved to climb up on my knee And ask such questions as who or why What is that thing up in the sky?  Wasn't it only yesterday you started school, And I tried so hard to be very cool, But, as you walked in the door and sat in your place, I did what I could to hide my face.  Remember that day we walked to the park, We played so late, it began to get dark. We started back home, your little hand in mine, You were so happy and had such a good time.  It seems to me you were only eight, When you wanted to know when you could date. I laughed and said, "You're a little young, But all too soon your time will come."  Before I knew it, you were in your teens, Sloppy T-shirts and scruffy blue jeans, Parties and dances, staying out late, Ignoring your homework, saying, "It can wait."  Now you stand before me with your diploma in hand, In your cap and gown, and you look so grand. I hold back the tears that threaten to fall, And put on a smile as you walk down the hall.  I look at you and I want to see The little child who sat on my knee. But the years are gone and can't be revived, Except in my heart, where I will keep them alive.  So now it's time for me to let go, How much it hurts, you'll never know. Go now, my child, take your place in the crowd, For whatever you do, I know I'll be proud.                           by  Florence Brown                                 Corner Brook, NF  I had come across this poem many years ago in a Newfoundland newspaper while I still lived in Grand Bruit and knew it was the one I wanted to keep for her special day.  I pasted it into a scrapbook with corresponding photos and it looks wonderful.  I cry each time I read it because it says what I am feeling so well.

       The Empty Nest   Well, she's moved out.  I'm in Halifax now, at my neice's house.  The original plan was to stay at Amber's last night on the couch, but it didn't make it from Port Hawkesbury yet, so I'm over here.  So that found me leaving her behind in her new apartment with the boyfriend a day early...WAHHHHHHH...I had been holding it together very well, thank you, all along.  Denial was working pretty good for me.  Then as I left this young lady's apartment, she demanded tears from me before I left and then set to work telling me the reasons why I should be crying...ask and you shall receive...I cried the whole way here, and then some.  So there I stood, a blubbering mess, locked in embrace with my only child, leaving her as she begins the next chapter of her life - in her own home.  It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.  Gawd, I'm blubbering again now.  How did I get here so fast?  How can I be the mother of a grown child who lives in another city?  Where is that child who would patter out from her room, Sally Ann (the doll) tucked under one arm as she sleepily rubbed her eyes and croaked out "good morning mommy".  It's one of my favorite memories of her childhood.  I heard this for years, and now I long to hear it again.  Since moving into my new place, I have set this Sally Ann upon my closet shelf - she too had been outgrown...and when I feel lonesome, I will leave that door open so that I may remeniece about this child.  My friends say having Sally Ann and the other dolls of her childhood on the shelf creep them out, but they bring me only comfort - although I have to admit, the porcelain doll is a bit creepy and will soon find new quarters.  I have left my daughter to take her place in the crowd - go now Amber and make me proud. (paraphrased from a poem by Florence Brown that will be posted in a few days).

       Graduation Week   Oh what a night…or should I say nights…as previously described, the past week was to be a busy one…The week began with the Grand March and Prom Night.  The Grand March appeared to be quite a waste of time and energy…you take over 100 graduates, pair them up and make them prance around the auditorium stage for an hour in various groupings.  There is no significance attached, it just is.  The auditorium is another story…there is no limit on who can attend, so everyone and their dog and their neighbor came, and because I though 20 minutes before it began was soon enough to go, I had to stand in the hall.  The auditorium was PACKED and people spilled into the stairways, jammed the back areas, etc.  I managed to finally squeeze in behind some others standing up, but it was uncomfortable to do so for an hour…elbows in the face and back and so on…all for naught…just a bit of prancing.  So then they announce that the fathers are to dance with the daughters.  Amber’s dad is still in Halifax so she had pre-arranged for Brad’s father to dance with her, just so she wouldn’t feel left out.  It was very sweet and sure made her happy.  Following that, they danced with their date, then proceeded into the gym for the Prom.  I had a look around and took a few pictures before heading home.  There wasn’t much for décor, but the tiki bar was cool.  This year’s theme had been Tropical Paradise or something like that.  Tuesday night was the Grad Dinner.  This was a purchased ticket affair, so tons of room for us to sit, and a lovely meal.  The tech class had prepared a video collage which was very nice to watch while we ate dinner, and there were a few presentations and speeches…not much, which was FINE with me.    Wednesday evening, I finished off moving my stuff to the new house.  I was getting tired, but not out of steam yet.  Thursday morning I had to work, then spent all afternoon unpacking, then headed into town to have supper with Amber, Brad, Al and his crazy lady.  Al treated us all to Pizza Delight which was a nice surprise.  Then we headed off to the graduation and got excellent seats.  It was a proud night for us as parents. Amber received the Honor Cord which is awarded for maintaining an 85% average all during high school…you could see the heads turn when she received THAT…as many judged her by her appearance and assumed she was just another dumb punk…NOT!  She also received several bursaries, including one from each of the local newspapers, which was very cool.  She beamed with pride as the tears rolled down my cheeks.  I thought I was going to lose it a few times, but carefully reconstructed that wall around my emotions for a few more days yet…I had so much more to do…  Friday I spent cooking and cleaning, and getting prepared for the big party I was to throw for Amber’s success.  My brother was even coming down, which tickled both Amber and I.  I also had a bunch of the gals coming, Brad’s mother and sisters, Amber’s friends and parents, etc….It was a huge success, and people were so generous and kind to Amber…it was nice to see her enjoy the day so much.  Brad was chief cook on the grill and did a fabulous job – Thanks bud!  There was too much food, as usual, but settled nicely in my fridge and Amber’s.  We wound down around 11pm or so and were EXHAUSTED.    Amber was able to garner tears out of many of the women by showing them the booklet I had prepared for her with the poem in it.  I’ll post it above.  It is a beautiful poem.

       Grad Dinner   Ok, it was a good meal, we weren't crowded in and there were seats left over.  They showed a video production that was pretty good, although Amber only appeared in a baby photo, likely because she finished school in January and the shot it after that.  But the video was entertaining and well put together just the same.  Dinner was hot turkey, mashed potatoes, veggies, coleslaw and rolls.  Only one more night of this to go...

      Well, got a call tonight that my house is cleaned and ready...whoo hoo!  I can pick up the keys tomorrow, so that's AWESOME!  I have to get some $$$ from my new roomie so I can give them a cheque for the rent and damage deposit.  Then we are good to go!  I can hardly wait...I'd begin moving tomorrow night if I had time, but there is that pesky grad dinner...wonder how late that runs?  If I can just get out there with the entertainment unit and get that beast put together...we shall see...  I am ready to move.  Now.

       The Grand March   What is that anyhow...well, at SAERC (Strait Area Education and Recreation Centre) it means cramming 1000 people into a 500 seat auditorium, and having them watch the grads prance around in their prom outfits to the sound of Pachelbel's Canon.  They walked SO SLOW, you know that old step shuffle that people used to do at weddings...and prance around on the stage for about 30 minutes, then they have the grads dance with their matched partner, then call for the dads and moms to dance with their son/daughter.  It was interesting to see the parents try to shuffle their way through the overcrowded auditorium, over seats, people, etc...but they all managed to get there.  Then they had the grads dance with their prom dates, and THEN they made their way to the gym where the actual prom was taking place.  I went over to take a peek, as I didn't go to my prom, so wanted to at least say I had been to someones!!!  It was a tropical theme, and looked pretty nice, but not overly decorated.  Nothing on the ceiling at all, and very little on the walls.  Just a few props, but the Tiki bar was pretty cool.  I guess they had a problem with getting people to volunteer to decorate.  same old story.  Anyhow, she seemed happy enough, whatever it looked like and they'll have a few dances there, and head off to the prom party after the dance ends at midnight or so, coming home to change of course!!!    So there we are, one night of Grad nearly over, only three more to go...

       The Prom   Well, tonight is her last prom.  As usual, some things are left to the last minute...I asked her a couple of days ago before I packed all my sewing stuff if her dress was too long.  I had only seen it on her in the store, without shoes.  She assured me it was indeed the right length with her shoes on.  So tonight when this charming child tries on her dress now that she has her hair all fluffed and done, and this child shows her mother - it is about 2-3 inches too long.  A disaster waiting to happen...GAWD.  So rifling through boxes I go, just two hours before prom, digging out sewing stuff and off to the sewing machine I go.  It got done, but I should have know better...  But par for the course.  Earlier today, she headed over to Brad's aunt to get her hair done.  I was to pick her up at the aunts and bring her home...after all, we can't have her hitchhiking back with such poofy hair.  I had timed my last home visit to end at the end of the work day and then off I would go to pick up said child.  10 minutes left of my home visit and out comes a disclosure about another child being abused...WTF!!!  So I get all the info I can, then tear off out the door, hoping to catch a supervisor still at work, phone half the building and find no one at their desks...of course, its 4:30pm and they're out of there like a herd of elephants...sheesh.  I drive just down the street to my own house (see, clients are too close for comfort) so I can use a land phone, make another dozen calls, leave a phone message for my supervisor and take off to get said child.  I am tearing off towards her and see traffic ahead (I live in SMALL TOWN) so I know the only reason for traffic is the causeway is open.  DRAT!  So I end up finally getting a hold of my supervisor, giving out the referral on speakerphone while waiting for the causeway to open up...it finally does, I am still on speakerphone, driving across the causeway, then make the turnoff to where said child is when I hear this enormous horn blow - I look in my rearview to see who the hell I have pissed off now, thinking I cut off a trucker or something and then swing my head back to the front of me just in time to notice the train coming down the tracks and the railway crossing lights FLASHING...I slam on the breaks, pull up the emergency break, all while still chatting on the speakerphone with supervisor and after hours duty worker...the train passes, I keep on going, trying to remember where the heck I am picking up this kid at as I have never been there before, still on the cell phone in the crook of my neck, imparting valuable information...I tear up someones driveway, not knowing where I am going, back up with cell still under my neck, hoping I don't land in the ditch (as anyone knows me, I don't do well backing down driveways...) and then decide ENOUGH!!! I AM PARKING TO FINISH THE DARN CALL!  Just as I do, said child comes waltzing down the driveway - it was the right one after all...she says to me "didn't you see me waving my hands to you???"  Sure...just get in the car before someone dies tonight.  So, we made it home, supper was a mixed bag...lovely roasted chicken that I had managed to stuff at lunchtime and entrusted to the younguns to cook.  Brad burnt the potatoes and did not realize it would affect the taste when he mashed it all together...hmmm...I had also not realized there were only two measly carrots....so we had chicken and stuffing with a few scraps of carrot.    And now it is raining and I didn't get any outdoor pictures of said child in her dress because I spent too much time hemming it tonight.  And the fun has just begun...

      moving day is approaching and it can't come soon enough!  I have my living room filled with boxes and almost all of the entertainment packed up with the exception of this computer and my little tv in my bedroom.  I may have to resort to a book.    Seriously though, I was reading Alistair MacLeod's  No Great Mischief  and should probably get back to that.  Things have all been awry with all the changes this month...it will be great to get back into some sort of routine.  I haven't been on my treadmill in a number of days, but not like I am not running marathons anyhow with everything that has to be done.  It seems like I pack every day, for hours, and there is still so much to pack...endless!  And just when I thought I had a night to spend with the younguns, and had planned a nice chicken dinner...they were (and me) invited out to his parents for a lobster feast.  Now I don't eat lobster, but was assured there was plenty else...it's the thought that counts.  We are giving Brad his graduation present tonight too, an accoustic guitar that he has mentioned wanting no less than 100 times since I have known him and he darn near bought one a number of times, but we had been planning this forever.  His face will light up the room tonight, I'm sure.  He surely deserves it too, as he has worked so hard at everything and we are all so proud of him.  Music means so much to him too, and he loves the accoustic sound of this particular one.  so my chicken dinner has been rescheduled to tomorrow night, and hope that everyone here can put a hand in towards cooking it as we are all fairly busy - me with work, Amber with grand march and then getting THE HAIR done, and I am not sure what Brad is up to tomorrow.  It must be cooked tomorrow though as we are out of nights to cook for them.  they managed to work something out for moving their stuff.  A relative of Brad's is going to let us use his truck to tow a trailer to Halifax with all their stuff in it.  Who'd a thunk it was so hard to arrange a move, but I guess everyone moves out of Cape Breton, and few move in.  Brad is in the middle of a job interview right now, at A & W (not to work at A & W though) with some fellows from Rod's Machine Shop in Halifax.  He was quite excited so I hope he gets the job.  The real challenge will be figuring out the bus system in time to get to work!  I may stay an extra night to help them sort that out.  Like Brad always says...things are coming up Brad all over...lol

        ConBRADulations    Well, the boyfriend of resident teen has graduated tonight from college.  He successfully completed the diploma in Welding, 2 year program.  YAY BRAD!  And today he received a call about a job.  Remember the trip to Halifax last week?  Well one of the resumes he dropped off paid off and they are down in Cape Breton for the weekend at Margaree, and will drive to Port Hastings (next door) for the interview at none other than A & W, where the resident teen will be working that day...talk about pressure!!!  We wish him well, and hope he gets the job...he'll hear later this week.  So now the kid needs to get a job, but it looks good for her...her boss is going to make a call to the owner, who also owns the A & W's in Halifax and help her get a job there.  With any luck, they will both be working just days after they move next weekend...now if they can only find a way to get their stuff there!!!  There appear to be no rental trucks available, and they can't scrape up a friend to take a truck towing a trailer...not yet anyhow...I told them good luck...its their responsibility to get their stuff up there and I had cautioned them on gathering too much before they moved...now they have a truck load.  the younguns have headed out to a party tonight in L'Ardoise.  At least they have a DD tonight, so I can rest easy, and the DD and b/f are coming back into town reasonably early to go to another party.  I will content myself watching Ellen tonight, as I usually do!

      well, my friend Kathleen has moved all of her stuff out, except for what she takes on the plane and in the car.  The movers came today to take her stuff up north, and her dad was over to pick up her stuff for storage at his place...I guess I really am going to move in!  The landlord wants to have a couple of days to check things out, fix anything, etc, then I can begin to move stuff in.  We had a few drinks and food over at the local tap and grill tonight to say good bye and the gang at work chipped in for a digital camera for her.  She is travelling the Dempster Highway and will be working up north for a bit and we want to see what it looks like up there!  So I set her up with a blog and an msn community in which to share her photos.    seems tonight is not so newsworthy...

       The Hubcap    Ray: Above all instruments, why did you choose a hubcap?   Kevin: Raymond, I am a hubcap player because my father before me was a hubcap player Raymond, and his father before him was a hubcap player Raymond, and in order to play a hubcap back in the 1930s, you had to be willing to grab on to the old spoke wheel, tire and all. So, give her, come on.  - Buddy Wasisname and the Other Fellers  And then there was the ordeal with the hubcap.  Last Tuesday, as earlier reported, I had a flat tire in Halifax, just around the corner almost from the Toyota dealership.  It was drizzling rain and so Brad was elected to change the tire and touch the "dirty stuff" - you know, the "guy stuff".  Not that I can't change a tire, because I can and I have done it more times that Brad, who has no driver's license yet...however, I wanted to give him a "manly task" in light of the dress shopping we were about to do.  So he changed the tire effectively enough, but left out one small detail - the hubcap.  I recalled seeing it on the grass next to the parking lot where we changed the tire, and I recall thinking it was going to be left behind.  I further recall mentioning such a thing and being assured it wouldn't. I can almost recall the hubcap being placed in the trunk on top of the tire. Almost   Great.  We went to Toyota, got the new tire, and away we went.  As we are leaving Halifax the next day and are already out of the city, I notice - no hubcap.  Great.  Did Toyota forget to put it back on?  So I called them and got one of my HUGEST PET PEEVES - automated voice system.  I got to a point where I thought I could leave a message, but was left wondering was I talking to a dead phone, or was something being recorded.  I had politely asked that if they had my hubcap, could they call me back and let me know either way.  If they had it, I wanted them to send it on to my local Toyota Dealership.    Well, no one called.  A week went by so I called them again and found out that they had actually written on the work order that no hubcap was found to put on once the tire was replaced.  I looked at my copy of the work order - no mention.  Oh, sorry about that Ms Billard, it should have been noted on your work order.  No shit.  If it had, I would have realized right away that I didn't have a hubcap and could have gone around the corner to the Canadian Tire gas bar and gotten it where it likely sat on the grass.  Now here we are a week later, who knows where it could be???  Thanks bud.  So I called the Canadian Tire gas bar - luckily there are a limited number and I got the right one on the first call.  Yes we have a hubcap from a Toyota.  CAN YOU HOLD IT FOR ME??? Sure, we will put it in the office.  BTW, where did you find it - on the grass next to the curb.  Oh, ok.  Thanks. I will pick it up in two weeks.  So I talk to B-Rad and he swears he put the hubcap in my trunk when he changed the tire.  Um, apparently not there B-Rad.  But all is ok because I can get it back next week.  Saved me from buying a $50 part for the car.  I just have to have a naked rear right tire for a little while longer. heh heh.

      Ok, I have had about enough sun.  HAHAHAHA just kidding.  It has been really nice weather here lately, and not too hot, just hovering in the high teens and 20s which is JUST where I like it to be.  I sure hope moving day is about the same.  There is talk that we won't be getting a very nice summer and not much heat.  WEll, sunny days I would like, but the usual humid high heat spells, good riddance!  I would like to hear from my faithful readers - you know who you are.  Hows about a comment or two once in a while?  Just click on the comments below each entry, click post a comment and then type something in the box so I know who's there.  I know of at least 4 of you that read this nearly every day :-)  come on, admit it!

        the worst is yet to come    Well, went to the Annual General Meeting tonight for my agency.  Was chatting with someone from our board of directors who works part-time with the resident teen.  He started talking about how I would miss her when she moves away...gawd, I nearly bawled on him.  The worst is yet to come.  When I have to drive out of her parking lot on the 27th, I know it will be just plain hard.  How do you separate from someone who has been in your life for 18 years?  And for the past 7 years, it has basically just been the two of us, with the exception of a few months here and there when her father lived with us (not counting the collection of room mates I had in university).  I know my every happiness isn't defined by her, but she sure brightens my day!  Lookout Cibele, I will be looking to mother you, heh heh.  FYI, Cibele is the new rommie that moves in next week with me.  I took her out to see the house last night for the first time and she loved it.  I can't wait to be living there and all unpacked.  For anyone that knows me, I prefer my things ordered and in their place...I am not a neat freak by any stretch...the dustbunnies can attest to this, but I am bothered by clutter, so having my stuff all crammed into boxes here and there this week really bothers me!  So by next Wednesday when I finally get to haul some of it out of here, I will surely be batty!!!  We chatted with the new neighbors last night too, and the landlord.  They are such nice people, we are so lucky.  And the landlord, Stephen is such a character, I just know we will hit it off.  He was cutting the grass last night so stirred up all the black flies...they were NUMEROUS!!!  I have a few bites already this year.  Lookout West Nile Virus!  anyhow, back to the kid and the worst is yet to come - I imagine her graduation will be a tearful event...the school will likely be looking for a muzzle for me, as I am bad enough at weddings, let alone my only child's graduation.  I will have to work hard to keep it in check for sure.  Don't want to embarrass her too much, heh heh.  so now I am off to pack some more crap...it is neverending...

      Got me a nice sunburn today.  I was sitting out back with a friend and the kid's boyfriend and we all got some sun.  Except is is only on my legs, the left side of each...guess I should have faced the sun more, lol.  The packing is coming right along.  I have most all non-essentials packed in all rooms.  The walls are bare, the windows are bare and their curtains have been washed and packed.  My desk is just about empty, and the only place left that has not been packed up is the kitchen.  I've gathered one box of Tupperware and taken the blue glass off the window, but I have been avoiding it basically.  Too many breakables.  And I am almost out of paper, and don't want to use newspaper.  I gave my friend Kathleen a huge bag of it that I really needed myself...darn.  What bugs me most is the clutter and mess that comes with packing.  ARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!  I can't wait to be all set up again in another place and packing far behind.  Why did I decide to move again???  Oh yeah, I remember, the noise, the clients, the smell, the noise (did I say that already).  So lets go already.  I don't move for 10 days, but I am darn near ready now.    I tried to watch an old movie tonight,  Trainspotting  - ps-ycho, (psss cyco - its the new thing with the kid).  All I know is that it was too hard to understand all those scots!   Strong accent and I was not up for translating, lol.  I just want to watch a nice happy story.  I tried to watch one that they had rented last night (movies aren't due back until 10pm here)  Club Dread ...well holy cow...GROSS, so that wasn't a happy story either.  Then I fell asleep watching  Return to Me  which is a happy ending story, but some sad stuff throughout.  I gave up and am now on my way to bed...got a full week ahead of me...sigh.

       sunny days, driftin away   ok, I wish, but the time is slipping by fast and I haven't finished packing yet!  I move in just 10 days or so, and I have SO MUCH TO DO!  And then we move the kid after that.  Yikes!  I did manage to pack up most of the living room the other day, but nothing since.  Today my goal is to pack up at least two rooms, and get all the bedding washed out.  My house is a mess, and I can't STAND it!    It is cold out again today, but sunny at least, so makes for a pleasant enough day.  Amber is working all day today and tomorrow.  The boyfriend has gone with friends for the weekend, kind of a last hurrah before moving away in two weeks.  So I am basically alone for most of the weekend...have to be productive, although I am hoping to visit friends out in the country later today or tomorrow.  must get going now...

       Here kitty, kitty, kitty   ok, so I'm packing to move and the cat is insane.  She is jumping in and out of boxes, and around furniture, on top of bags, threading herself through plastic bags, and so on...then she gets behind a box and gets trapped.  I guess she squeezed in behind it, and realized the only way out was to back up...which she had some difficulty doing, so instead I hear scrabbling and scratching and I was wondering WHAT IN THE HELL IS SHE DOING??? so I finally found her, trapped behind the box and rescue her.  She looks at me totally non-plussed as if to say "I was fine, I was just checking out this here box".  She is too funny.  Now she is curled up licking herself on a huge Walmart bag.  I fail to understand the attraction of sleeping on a rattling plastic bag, but she does it all the time.  Put a bag in a room anywhere, and she is ON it.  She is such a great cat...don't know what I would do without her.  I hope she likes the new place, and whoops any mice that happen to inhabit the house.

      Well, I deleted my last post.  I just couldn't even stand to look at it myself.  I have used this blog to natter on endlessly and felt I was spoiling the normally lighthearted mood I tried to keep here, even when complaining about the kid.  So I deleted it.  I don't want to be reminded every time I log on of the whole situation, and I don't want to remind others either.  So here we are, back to the lighter stuff...check out my next post!

       My dear sweet child   It is hot here.  It is even hotter in my house because the dear sweet child was cold in the house, so opened all the curtains and windows and turned my once cool house into an OVEN.  It is 29C with a humidex of 32C, which is not the worst its been, but coming from about 5C yesterday, it is hot enough.  She had been outside, sunning herself, and got too hot so came inside and found it too cold, so opened the windows AND the screenless window in the side door.  We now have several LARGE wasps in the house.  Thankfully I have been able to trap most of them in the windows when I shut them all again.    You would think she had learned how to keep the house cool in humid weather...after all, we did spend FIVE years in hot, humid and polluted southwestern Ontario, but NOOOOOO, she forgot the whole thing.  So I chewed her out for it, and she said she was sorry...doesn't help me though.  Our air conditioning is not yet reinstalled at work, so I sweated the day away in the sauna that is my office, only to come home to absolutely no relief.  ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH.  Ok, I feel vented now...

      and did I mention the accident that I inadvertently caused?  While we were working on Friday, we were waiting to meet up with police in order to serve the parents, and I pulled into a driveway between two businesses, kind of like an alley.  I wanted to pull out again and face the other way as I couldn't see the police when they came.  So I began to back up, and the truck that had parked across the end of my car noticed, so he began to back up, BUT what he didn't do, is look in his rearview mirror...there was a little car right behind him, kind of the size of a Ford Escort...he crunched right into the drivers side front panel and tore paint and metal...I was waving to him and yelling for him to stop, but when he finally did, it was too late.  He had one of those big dimpled steel bumpers too, so he didn't get a scratch.  It was almost funny, although not for the escort...heh heh.    Glad it wasn't my car!

       The Halifax Trip   Well, it has been an eventful two days...we left early yesterday morning for Halifax, and spent the morning having Brad drop off resumes in over a dozen Welding shops in Burnside and area.  He got some good vibes from several of them, so hope that he gets a bite.  Then we went in search of apartments...there wasn't much to pick from in the price range they can afford...the first place we looked at was a DUMP and STUNK.  It was so tiny, there wasn't room to turn around.  BUT the second place they looked at was so awesome, they jumped on it right away.  It was $600/month with heat and hot water included.  The apartment is clean, new looking with beautiful kitchen cupboards, roomy and bright, with a lovely view overlooking the harbour and bridge I think.  We were shown the one down below it, but she clamied it was even nicer.  A very secure building, nice laundry room right there, and an underground parking garage.  So, they filled out an application and found out some hours later that they were accepted for a one year lease.  AND, it is just down the street from where her father lives, so he can walk over any time.  Which is awesome, then he doesn't have to bring HER, who Amber does not like, let alone me.  Following checking out the apartment, we were heading over to look and see where her father lives, and happened to skim a curb with the car and popped a tire.  Thankfully it happened just up the street from the Toyota dealership!!!  So Brad and I whacked on the donut tire and headed back to the dealership where they replaced the tire (all covered under my Extended Car Plan) and we were on our way.  We headed down to Halifax Shopping Centre where Amber found the perfect prom dress at Sears at a very reasonable price, and then we picked up a tie for Brad, and shoes for the kid.  They also bought some household items too.    So then we headed back to my neice's house for the rest of the evening, and visited.  My other neice showed up and it was great to see everyone.  This morning we have to go to the bank, sign the lease, check out the shipyards (more resumes from Brad) and then we get to go home...I get to relax, they get to pack.  Their apartment is free to move into on the 15th of this month, which is just next week!  It panicked them a little, but they will be ok.  We will be moving them on the 19th, as we have to wait for the weekend for me to be able to drive the truck up there.  Amber can't move up until the following weekend as she has her Grad stuff all that week.  And sometime in there I have to move out of my place!!!  I just don't see any restful days coming soon...And I haven't even begun to pack!!!  no wonder I am tired...

       I thought weekends were for relaxing...   Apparently not for me...sheesh...well, I did manage to squeeze some in at the staff bbq and overnight on Friday night...although I was late for that because I was too busy at work, and had to take two children into care, which creates a WHOLE LOTTA more work.  Main thing is, the kids are now safe, and that is why I am there in my job.    So the BBQ and staff party...well, we had delicious steaks, lobster and chicken with tons of salads, and there definitely was alcohol flow...the entertainment of the night was a Scavenger Hunt that myself and another worker ran...BOY OH BOY do they get competitive when they think they can win something.  It was cutthroat I tell you.  And following the hunt, we went into Karaoke...WELL NOW, I never knew we had so much talent at the agency.  Britney Spears and Christina Skankulara showed up (Wendy) and was trying to sex up the show, says she.  Well, it must have worked on the Testosterone part of the judging because they won fo best act.  Our group won for Funniest, and that we were.  We had on big eye glasses, and sang Summer Nights from the Grease Soundtrack, then Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer...and when Britney tried to sex up our act and interfere, we pretended to kick the crap out of her (Stacey and I).  It was hilarious.  So Saturday...drive back from overnight, shop for birthday party, then finish Amber's recipe book - had do hand-stamp the design on after good friend Rob printed it off for me.  The plain print looked a little blah, so used my scrapbooking stamps to finish it up.  That took me only THREE HOURS!!!  Then I had to write notes from the day before as I had to meet with our agency lawyer for an affidavit the next day....THREE HOURS MORE.  I was exhausted but waited up for the kid to come home.  She and the boyfriend had taken my car to Antigonish for the evening to visit with some friends.  When they got back, we celebrated Amber's birthday, since it was just past midnight on the 6th of June.  She loved her gifts, and try as we might to make her cry with our sappy cards and poems, we didn't crack her.  She's tough...Brad even wrote her a song, and called it Amber's Song.  It is quite nice.  So after the gifts, we stayed up until 2:30am watching the Trailer Park Boys.  Brad and I got hungry so we cooked up some spaghetti and no sooner had we sat down to eat it when the power went out!!!  So there we sat in total darkness, with our spaghetti...I fumbled around for some matches, and we finished by candlelight.  Mine got cold, however, so I did try to warm it up in the microwave...  Up again at 6:00am, got work to do...make potato salad, macaroni salad, make cookies...ooops, missing ingredient for cookies...phew, don't have to make those now.  Head over to the office to put my notes into the sytem..can't because the server is down, probably from the power being off...head to lawyers office and print off there.  Then got the gang up later to help clean up the house for company that was coming for lunch.  Then chop up all the stuff for shishkabobs, realize I don't have room for them all on BBQ, look for charcoal for hibachi...send kid out, she comes back without starter fluid...I go out, 6 stores later, find some.  The BBQ was Awesome, we had 7 of us sitting in party hats and chowing down.  We all hung out for a  bit then it was time for the kid to head to work, and I had to get to the lawyer's office to do up my affidavit.  THREE HOURS LATER I get to come home...and phew...too tired so go straight to bed.  Where does the relaxing part come in???

        My famous neighbors    Did I mention that someone almost famous came to my yard sale?  Turns out Ashley MacIsaac's mother was at my yard sale...they live two doors down.  I am thrilled (HAHAHAHA).  For those of you who DON'T know who Ashley is, he is a very talented fiddler from Cape Breton with a very talented way for getting his bad boy mouth into trouble.  He is also known for flashing the crowd when he wears his kilt when he plays.    If you want to know more about this local boy who made it big and pissed a lot of people off with his antics...check here -  urlLink Ashley MacIsaac  You can even hear samples of his music here.    Just think, they have lived there for months and I never knew.  And incidentally, I actaully saw Ashley perform on stage in Waterloo some years back.  He played in Hagey Hall on the University of Waterloo campus - no admission charge.  He was awesome and quite subdued, in spite of his knack for grandstanding and pranks.

       Releasing my anger   Well, I was faced with a situation tonight that led to immediate anger.  It wasn't even all that life alteraing, but I got angry nonetheless...welcome to a Sophia moment...  Picture it, Guatemala, 2004...it was towards the end of the trip I had dragged myself and daughter through sweaty central america and I hadn't bought hardly a single souvenir for myself.  Finally, there they are, the perfect gift for me - a set of 6 lovely vivid blue and multicolor (as things in Guatemala always are) placemats and napkins.  I HAD to have them.  Sure, I had seen tons of sets before, but these, oh these were just the right shade and coloring.  So I haggled, as they do very well in central america, and bought them.  I don't even recall the price, really - likely about 25 or 30 quetzales, which is just about $4US or so.  Not a lot of money, but I was very happy with them.  I had bought a purse in Flores, and now we were in Antigua, I bought the placemats.  I later bought a large cloth, and a book cover and that was it.  Lovely daughter had bought dozens of things for herself.  Good for her.  We were worried about weight on the small prop plane we returned to Flores on, so I packed all my souvenirs in my old purse (its a big purse) and lugged them onto the plane.  I had bought a number of things for friends and family.  They all made it back to Canada safely, so it should have been a happy ending...  think again.  I had thought about not using the placemats, but then, I hate the thought of buying anything and putting it "away" for later.  So I put them out.  The very first meal we have on them, my lovely daughter spills a large quantity of gravy on hers.  So, deep breath...I take it and rinse it in the kitchen sink and hang it on the back of the chair to dry.  She hears me rant briefly about it, and UNDERSTANDS that the placemats are important to me.  AT LEAST THATS WHAT I THOUGHT.  Today, this darling child feasts on lobster on our dining room table.  I am not home, but at work.  It's her birthday in a few days and dad sent her money which she bought herself a feast of lobster with since he isn't close by to take her out.  Wonderful.  what a lovely idea.  Too bad she forgot to take the placemats off the table.  They get downright filthy, apparently, as you can imagine what two young people are like with four lobsters in front of them...why not do what she had done her whole life of growing up with lobsters and spread newspapers over the table???  Or better yet, eat them outside on the patio table and then hose it off.  But no, that was too much trouble.  Instead, they spill water and lobster crap all over them and then thinks that the best solution is to take these placemats and fires them off into the laundry with a bunch of clothes before I get home from work....  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I still am unaware.  This darling child goes off to work in my car, I come home and notice the placemats are not on the table, but figure she just moved them off while they ate the lobsters on newspaper.  After all, the table is cleared of everything, so it was a logical assumption.  And as said previously, she has feasted on lobster every year of her life since she could chew it up, and it was ALWAYS ON NEWSPAPERS.  I don't say anything to Brad, and hang out for a while before my friend comes over and we go out for shopping and a draft at Millers.  Forward to me coming home and up the stairs to find Brad sitting on the edge of her bed, untangling something from darling child's clothing.  I figure it is just the waistband of some underwear or a bra that has unravelled, like usual and wrapped itself into a knot on some piece of clothing.    I wish.  Turned out to be the unravelling of my dear placemats.  She had washed AND dried them in the dryer.  There are threads everywhere as they unravelled from the abuse.  They are faded and the blue color has run into the lighter colors, and they are shrunken to the size of napkins, or smaller.  Brad looks helplessly at me, and asks me if I am going to lose it...I smile ever so sweetly and answer, OH YES, I AM.  I call the darling child and chew her a new body cavity, and then get back to the placemats.  He has managed to unleash the pair of pyjama pants they had tangled their unravelled selves up in and hands me the BALL of thread.  I had to cut them apart and trim all the ends.  It is a darn shame.    I have to wonder what possessed her to put them in the dryer, as she has seen me put our woven placemats (from Walmart or the Dollar store) hang on the drying rack in the basement for YEARS!!!  And to add to it, when I cleaned the gravy off, she asked me how I did it and I told her I rinsed it in the sink because I didn't want to put them in the washer.  Apparently I was tuned OUT that day.  Now I know that they are just material things, pieces of cloth, but for gawd's sake, I sweat my butt off on that trip and brought back very few souvenirs and now she has ruined one of them already.  We haven't even been back a month yet.    But then I have to acknowledge a comment made by this darling child which puts it in another light..."I guess I just got you back for breaking my shotglass from the colliseum in Rome last year".  Well, perhaps...but you ruined a set of 6 placemats, where I only broke 1 shotglass, and that was because you had it put next to the computer on an unsteady keyboard tray...comparable?  good question.    I am left with one thought then, tonight...when is moving day again?

      now, that's done.  called all the utility companies and made necessary arrangements.  The only possible glitch is that Aliant is on strike (the phone company) so we might be late getting my number moved out to the house...however, Cibele is taking over Kathleen's phone number and they don't have to come out for that, so should be able to do it in a day or two once she moves out.  So we will have her line to begin with.  I have to say goodbye to high speed internet...whatever will I do???  There is only dial-up, so I won't be online as much.  I am ordering the unlimited though, so I don't have to count hours.  And we will have two phone lines, so if folks can't get us on one, they can try the other.  AND there is internet call manager with Aliant that has a popup window that tells you someone is calling you if you happen to be on the net.  It will just be the SLOWNESS we have to contend with.  Perhaps I will rediscover other pursuits then!  I have tons of unfinished projects that I could be working on instead of plunking here each night....be prepared to hear about them, heh heh.  half-way sunny day most of the day...I am getting worried about my tan fading though.  Perhaps the sunny day on the weekend we are promised will be warm enough to tan.  We have a staff BBQ and overnight event this Friday...I wonder if a raised blood alcohol content will affect tanning ability?  Anyone know? ;-)

      bright and early in the morning, it is..what in the heck am I doing up?  Well, I misread the clock for one...thought it was 10 to 7, not 10 to 6.  But I am up now, so will take advantage of the quiet morning.  I have some reading to finish for NSASW anyhow (oops!), and I want to spend some time on the treadmill again this morning.  Its hard work keeping it from becoming a clothes rack, you know.  Thought I might take a cue from the Hoser's blog and do a few lists of my own...  check back occasionally for one when I feel like it.

       Moving Days   Well, the verdict is in - I passed the "interview" and have been invited to rent Kathleen's rental house in the country.  I am hoping to move in around the 23rd if possible...now comes all the other work....packing of some sort, and phone calls to the utilities to change things over for phone, power, oil, cable, internet, etc.  I have begun a list of things that need to be done...and who is going to help me...remember all those offers of help folks?  Don't even think of hiding...I know where you live...heh heh...just kidding...it should run smoothly on the moving days.  I am usually organized enough that it just does.   And then at the end of the month, we have move number 2.  Amber and Brad will be moving to Halifax for July 1st they hope...we are heading up next Monday to look for an apartment, prom dress and for them both to apply for work in person.  I hope they are successful on all issues!  Now for a hello to my faithful readers...Tobey and Tammy...gawd, don't you guys do anything else?  just kidding...at least someone is reading it!  I like just having it as a record of my meager existence...proof that I have done something other than just sit and knit while watching movies...which actually sounds pretty good right now, only I have reading to do for my NSASW Supervision tomorrow morning (Nova Scotia Association of Social Workers).  So off I go...

       well HOLY COW   I forgot to mention yesterday that the sun actually came out...it continued to spit rain and we were cheated out of a rainbow, but the sun was out.  and it is out again today!  I have dressed in corresponding attire, so much so that people will have to put sunglasses on to see me...you see, lime green is back IN!  I have on a lime green sleeveless top, and a lime green and dark green floral long skirt.  Then you have the purple/red hair to go with that...and it shows off my tan just lovely...  I bought a new bag last night...not a purse, but a tote.  I had been using a black soft nylon briefcase for work, but hated the way it looked...so official...yuck, and institutional.  So I bought a nice blue and tan tote for about $13 and will use that instead.  I thought of a neon beach tote, but rethought that one...after all, I don't want to look ridiculous...HAHAHA...I can hear your snickers from here...

        Its Been Two Long Years    Well, someone said to me that it was my anniversary today...mine and another worker's.&nbsp; It has been two long years since I began working as a social worker.&nbsp; Where did the time go.&nbsp; In some respects it seems like I just got here, and that it wasn't long ago that I finished school, while in most others, it feels like I have been here for years.&nbsp; This is the longest I have ever remained in the same job.&nbsp; ever.&nbsp; Not that I have been real transient in my careers...just haven't had a career until now other than parenting.&nbsp; which I did for 18 consistent years thus far.&nbsp; When I think of all that I have been through, and the changes that have occurred at work - staff turnover, moving offices three times, moving houses, hair color, etc...it has been a long two years alright.&nbsp; And I think that while I have learned a lot, one thing I have learned is that I have a lot more to learn yet.&nbsp;   I don't know if I'll be here another two years, or even just another year, but I do know this....I don't relish the thought of moving!&nbsp; As well, I am still content in my job, even with the events of this week, and as long as I am still content in my job, I'll remain, but when I begin to feel like I don't want to go to work anymore, then it might be time for a change.&nbsp; for now, I'm here.   two long years.

       My Girl    &nbsp;  I got to see my girl last night, as I had an unexpected trup to Halifax for the evening.&nbsp; It was just an hour that we stopped by for, but it was GREAT to see the kid and the boy.&nbsp; The apartment looks great and most importantly, I got a hug!&nbsp; I'm going back up again on Friday, so will see her for the long weekend, and we're hoping to hit the beaches and the waterfront over the weekend.&nbsp; The Tall Ships are in, which I have no interest in, but there are tons of activities planned for the waterfront, so that should be fun.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Otherwise, my life is getting busy again, mostly work related!!!

       Two Seasons - Winter and Campers    &nbsp;  Yup, its here...camper season.&nbsp; I just drove to Antigonish and saw no less than 200 campers, I am sure.&nbsp; I am referring, of course, to the whole group - winnabegos, truck-pulled, flat top, pop-up...you name it, we got it down here in Camp Breton.&nbsp; And none of them can go over 70kms/hr.&nbsp; And then there are the campers that think they can pass other campers on a hill...so&nbsp;they are double laned, blocking off any hope of getting by.&nbsp; Campers bring out the worst in people too...like the dumbass who tried to slam into me today...I am heading in the opposite direction and there is a camper with a whole string of cars and trucks&nbsp; behind it, as they usually are, when out of nowhere pops this mini-van (the other annoyance on the road) to pass the camper, and headed directly for me.&nbsp; I had to swerve to the shoulder to avoid him, the crazy idiot!&nbsp; I leaned on the horn as I drove by, but it scared the crap out of me just the same.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Since I have moved out into the country, I have less and less patience for driving anywhere that's busy...I couldn't wait to just get home and out of my car for the rest of the weekend.&nbsp; I'm on call, but likely I won't have to go far or in very busy places (knock knock).     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        One more morning and the crow gets it       &nbsp;   We have this annoying crow...not that all crows are not annoying, but this one in particular likes to travel from one side of the house to the other, squawking the whole way so he wakes both Roomie and I up.&nbsp; The last tenant (and my friend) used to feed the whole fam damily of crows...she had requested that I continue this tradition...I told her in no uncertain terms that I would love to STARVE THEM TO DEATH.&nbsp; So now their expectations are high, because she fed them all the time, but she also slept like the dead, so they didn't bother her in the morning.&nbsp; Now I have them.&nbsp; They won't get anything to eat here...the kitchen is closed.&nbsp; Now if I only had a good pellet gun.

        Awww..she misses me     &nbsp;  I was talking to Brad earlier tonight before Amber got home and he told me that when Amber was feeling homesick the other night and had a little meltdown, she mentioned that she missed her mother.&nbsp; Awwww...not that I doubted it, but is sure is nice to hear.&nbsp; I know I sure miss her, although I am coming to terms with living alone.&nbsp; She's been gone just 3 weeks but it seems like forever already.&nbsp; I am going up to visit next weekend, and can't wait.&nbsp; She is also coming down in early August for a weekend, so that should be exciting!&nbsp; Besides the one night she and Brad spent here the day before they moved away, this will be her first night visiting me in my new home.&nbsp; Awwww.    &nbsp;  Seems the non-resident teen is also a little shy in making friends.&nbsp; She is a pretty self-confident person, but I know she gets a little shy in making new friends in a new place...its that old fear of rejection that shows up in all of us.&nbsp; I wish I could make it better for her.&nbsp; I know she'll meet a ton of people in university this fall, but she really needs some friends this summer too.&nbsp; She misses her old ones from here, and will see them when she comes back next month for the weekend, but she understands the need to move on now that she lives in another city.    &nbsp;  Although I talk to her [Amber] every night, its still pretty lonely out here in the country.&nbsp; I know I have kitty, lol, but my room mate is sparse, so I spend most evenings alone here with kitty.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I miss her.  &nbsp;

      Here I sit... &nbsp; in the dark...its twenty to one in the morning and I am not tired enough for sleep, not yet anyhow, so I thought I would poke around on the net.&nbsp; It's a beautiful night, a few stars out, no wind, and very warm.&nbsp; It was a fine day today.&nbsp; I got all my laundry washed and nearly all of it dried on the clothesline...gawd, I love the country.&nbsp; Out here, I can hang my clothes out and it doesn't stink like pulp mill, but fresh air.&nbsp; And it dried so soft...the only fly in the ointment was the darn fly on my arm...or should I say swarm of&nbsp;deeres...damn things...some call them circle flies because they circle your head, over and over again, like they are trying to herd you somewhere.&nbsp; I got a big bite on my arm, and a number of them on my legs.&nbsp; Grrrr!&nbsp; I'll be glad when they're gone.&nbsp; At least they weren't out tonight when I was sitting out with friends. &nbsp; Cooked baked beans today, the first time in many years.&nbsp; And boy is it windy tonight... I invited my friends Rob and Angela over, and my neighbors over, and we had a lovely meal. I made tea biscuits as well, and we had strawberry shortcake for dessert...wonderful!&nbsp; Then we sat out (neighbors went elsewhere, prior commitment) and at first we thought the black flies were going to carry us away, but then we lit citronella candles and got a dose of  OFF  and we were good to go...until it began to rain.&nbsp; It didn't amount to much, just a sprinkle, but we went in anyhow. &nbsp; I watched the Amazing Race 5 tonight...its gonna be a good season...the fangs are out already.&nbsp; They are down to 9 teams, but it has been interesting thus far.&nbsp; I forgot to watch it on Tuesday night, but I have a dish, so wonderfully, I get several opportunities to watch it again on Saturday night.&nbsp; I can't wait until Survivor comes on again this fall...wonder where the next location will be? &nbsp; I have all day tomorrow to relax...if the weather is good, I may sit out and read for a bit.&nbsp; I tried to today, but got so busy with laundry, cooking, baking, errands to town, cleaning, and oh yeah, I was on duty and got a couple of calls, heh heh.&nbsp; I need to get a little more color on my legs.&nbsp; I know its not good for me...blah, blah, blah...but I like a bit of a tan. &nbsp; I see that my friend Tobey has posted her first post...yeah Tobey!&nbsp; She went to a concert tonight, Blue Rodeo with Jimmy Rankin opening.&nbsp; I wouldn't have minded going, but with me being on call, it would have been a pain in the ass, and since I did get a couple of calls, I would have had to leave.&nbsp; I hope they had fun! &nbsp; &nbsp;

         And the phone rang on          &nbsp;   There must be something about sisters that don't want me to sleep...this time I tried going to bed early again, same time, and had actually been in bed, just about asleep for nearly an hour...when out of the dark came BRRRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGG!&nbsp; My roommate's phone.&nbsp; And I just about lifted off the bed, it startled me so much.&nbsp; She wasn't home, so it rang and rang until the answering machine picked it up, and she had the machine turned up loud, so I heard who it was...her sister!&nbsp; So then it was another hour before my heart stopped pounding and I could get back to sleep.&nbsp; I think I need to begin wearing my earplugs...I will still hear the phone, but it won't startle me so much.   &nbsp;

        twitch and jerk?&nbsp; what twitch and jerk?        &nbsp;    So I began thinking about it and realized that perhaps I didn't blog about the twitch and jerking in my life.&nbsp; Now here's the real story.&nbsp; It began with the Effexor in 2002, and subsided somewhat when I came off.&nbsp; What it looked like was this - think of yourself laying in bed, just getting comfy, restful, and your body does this whole body jerk, just like you tripped on a set of stairs...now try having that happen about 70 times a night before you get to sleep.&nbsp; My head jerked to the right and my left leg really shoots out...funny I know.&nbsp; So it got a little better after coming off the Effexor and while on the Trazadone, it wasn't very bothersome...too zonked out to happen I guess.&nbsp; I wasn't 100% sure why it happened at all, but related it to the Effexor.&nbsp;        &nbsp;    Then I began on the Paxil...now we're havin' fun...try about 200 times a night, and sometimes during the day, when I was laying on the couch, or even sitting in my chair, relaxing.&nbsp; I even had a couple while sitting in the restaurant with the gals for lunch...WHOA.&nbsp; And then get me drunk&nbsp;and there's a whole other party going on.&nbsp; I was pretty sure then that it was related to SSRI drugs.&nbsp; (Selective Seretonin Reuptake Inhibitors).&nbsp; They persisted somewhat afer Paxil, so I asked the doc for a referral for neurology, which I got sometime in January I think.&nbsp;        &nbsp;    Now THAT was an experience!&nbsp; Amber wanted to go, purely for entertainment, as well as I didn't know what exactly they were going to do to me, so wanted her there to drive home.&nbsp; We also went shopping, so it was a good plan.&nbsp; Well, they gummed up my head and attached a bunch of electrodes for an EEG, and laid me down in a dark room.&nbsp; Amber was across the room, sitting next to the gal running the show.&nbsp; And what a light show it was...they talked to me, then flashed lights now and again...and sure enough, they waited just 10 minutes and the twitch and jerk show began.&nbsp; I was impressed...I had thought I would be too self-conscious for them to happen, but away my body went...it had the audience it needed!      &nbsp;    Turned out I have Primary Generalized Epilepsy, and while&nbsp;I likely will never suffer a seizure because, get this, I am too old to develop Partial Epilepsy...lol, it will likely be that twitching and jerking I experience will be with me forever.&nbsp; What the head doc said was everyone has a threshold for seizures, and mine happens to be lower.&nbsp; And the name for what my symptom is, is Myoclonus, spike and wave disorder.&nbsp; The Myoclonic jerks are what is happening to the body.&nbsp; So there it was, in the brain wave patterns on his computer.&nbsp; He printed off a page for me with a head jerk tracked on it...cool.&nbsp;        &nbsp;    So what does that all mean?&nbsp; Well, stay AWAY from SSRI's for sure, and anything else that lists seizures as a possible side effect, like Welbutrin.&nbsp; Stay away from anything with stimulants in it, like coffee, Ritalin or Dexadrine&nbsp;(sure...now I have to throw them all out, lol) and so on.&nbsp; Well, not a problem...don't use any of it.&nbsp; But good to know about the SSRI's.&nbsp; And get lots of rest.&nbsp; When I get tired, it will be worse.&nbsp; Great...just what an insomniac&nbsp;needs to hear.       &nbsp;    And the myoclonic jerks have all but subsided now...the only time I get them is just as I close my eyes for sleep...two or three at the most.&nbsp; Oh well, they help me relax...I remember saying to my sister that I was so tired, I just wanted to go home and twitch...        &nbsp;    So now you know.        &nbsp;

       Insomnia, the home version - not just for Al Pacino anymore    Ah...where do I start...its been in my life for many years...good old insomnia. I've been a poor sleeper for as long as I can remember...perhaps back to when I was first married or earlier. For years I just tried all the regular stuff...cut back caffeine, take warm baths, relax before bedtime, read a boring book, etc...however it never took care of the problem. Then came my trip to Ireland in 2001 and that totally threw my sleeping out the door, on top of me being sick when I got back. Wise doctor thought it was depression because I couldn't sleep and was crying all the time and gave me one of the new popular drugs - Effexor. WEll, didn't we have fun on that...the sleeping wasn't too bad, still irregular, but within about 8 months, the twitching and jerking began. I think I have mentioned that before. So we decreased the Effexor until I was completely off it. Then I went on another trip - slept somewhat because we were so busy on that trip to Europe, but when I got back, so was the irregular sleep and insonmia. I held on from July to October when I finally couldn't hack it any longer and went to see the local pill pusher. She too thought it was a recurrence of depression and gave me something else - Trazadone. Well, I sure got sleep with that one...night AND day. I was like a walking zombie. And if I took it at night on an empty stomach, HOLY COW, I often had to crawl from the bathroom to my room becuase it zonked me out that fast. OH NO...lets find something else...August arrives and a new doctor wants to try yet another SSRI - Paxil - the drug from hell.    Well, didn't we have FUN with THAT! First, take away all hopes of sleeping again, ever...then add 10 times the amount of twitching and jerking, followed by the inability to handle any stress...great, just what I needed. Took two months of that before finally saying ENOUGH! My problem is not depression, it is INSOMNIA!!! So after three weeks of withdrawal hell and the introduction of a new drug for sleep only, SLEEP WAS MINE!!! I finally got restful sleep, and without the all day sleep hangover.    However, one can't stay on that drug forever, as pretty as it is...(purple in fact) so I had to train myself to sleep at night again, and then get off the drug. Wouldn't you know that withdrawal from this drug - Imovane - includes insomnia...oh the irony. Anyhow, I managed to get off the drug after a few months, and was sleeping on my own fairly good for a month...then came yet another trip - Guatemala and Belize - end of sleep as I knew it. Ok...time to take up the Imovane again...and now I am on a vicious cycle - take it for a week or two to catch up on my sleep and then off for a week or two to see if I can sleep on my own again...and find out that I can't. So NOW what the hell do I do?   Got an appointment to see the doc next week - hopefully a trip to the sleep clinic will FINALLY be in order. I am so tired...    And then there are those people (you know who you are) who wait until late to call me...sometimes I don't mind, I am usually up, but in light of lack of sleep lately, last night I attempted to go to bed early at 9:45pm...which is really early for me, but I just was so tired. Well, watched a little television (that doesn't bother me, it puts me to sleep) and got all dozey so turned it off and rolled over to snuggle in for sleep...it was within reach, I felt it. Then BRRRRRRRIIINNNNNNNNGGGGG! 10:20pm - it was my sister - hi, how you doing? I was sleeping, whyever do you ask? So we chat for a little bit, and then her kids need something so she hangs up. Ok, back to the bed for sleep. Just get dozing again and BRRRRRRRRRRIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGG! 11:10pm - my sister again - Sorry to wake you again but I forgot to ask you for your address and when you were coming to visit me in September. Yawn...back to the bed...it is now 11:30pm, and I finally get drowsy enough to sleep again. 1:15am - I don't know why I woke up...last night was a drug-free night, so it happens. So I am WIDE AWAKE and decide to call my friend in the North West Territories since she is likely still up. Chat for abotu 45 minutes and then back to bed...this time with 1/2 of one of those little purple pills. And sleep the rest of the night.    My friend suggested that I turn my phones off when I go to bed, but PERISH THE THOUGHT! I would be freaking out about not getting that important call from the non-resident teen that she needs me...how can I dare to go to bed without the phone on? I would get less sleep, believe me.   My problem is not so much falling asleep, but staying asleep. I can usually fall asleep really easy, but once someone or something wakes me up...WIDE AWAKE I am. Yawn...its going to be a LONG day.

       the newest A & W employee   Well, the kid did it...she got herself a job at the A & W in Halifax's Scotia Square.  Whoo hoo!  She is happy enough about it too after her first day and saw how less than busy things are there compared to the last A & W she worked at.  No school busses of children to contend with, that's for sure!  And because it is a mall store, no tables or bathrooms to clean, which took up a portion of her time.  She has even made a new friend, complete with her phone number and invitation to hang out sometime.  Ahh, my little girl has moved on...  Yet I call her every single night :-)  She said she doesn't mind at all because no one else is calling her yet.  Most of her old friends don't have long distance phone plans I guess.  So we agreed that we would talk every night, even if it is for just 10 minutes until one of us was tired of it.  I can't imagine it would be me :-)  so there you are, both of them gainfully employed in the big city, and loving it.  What more could a mother ask for?

       I love my house   Have I said how much I love living here yet?  Well, I do.  And after a morning of baking in my huge kitchen, I love it even more.  I had so much room, there were parts of the counter that were empty...imagine!  In my place in town, I was so cramped in that tiny kitchen that I didn't really enjoy baking, but out here...lemme at it.  So this morning I made a batch of gingersnaps, peanut butter-chocolate chip cookies, and a batch of fudge.  I was going to make a lemon loaf, but realized I don't have a zester (something to grate the rind on) and so will either have to borrow one, or buy one.  Has it been that many years since I made a lemon loaf???  I have had the same grater for years...hmmm.  I also wanted to make some snowballs, rum balls, and maybe something else...I have given up for the day though and cleaned the kitchen.  Perhaps next week I will make more.  I am sending some treats up with a friend to Halifax for the younguns there, and I have brought some over to the next-door neighbor - I was informed by the past tenant (my friend) that the missus doesn't bake much and that extra treats would never go astray...when I left my house to bring them over, she met me on the bridge...I think she was excited...lol.  I enjoy baking when I have the room, and don't necessarily eat it much myself, but love sharing it with everyone.    All while I was baking, Darby the horse was out in his pen, and I can see him from the kitchen window, so I whistled to him and he whinnies back to me...its so cute!  He was more interested in the neighbor (his mistress) but I liked pretending he was whinnying for me, lol.  I brought him a treat too, of the vegetable persuasion.  And while I was amidst the baking frenzy, the roomie finally turned up.  She had been travelling in eastern Canada for the past week and a half with a friend.  I'm glad to have her back...its been a little lonesome out here with just me and the kitty :-)

       My name is not Douglass Schrage so stop calling here.   When I moved out here to the country, I asked for a new unlisted number.  I had had a client call me at home and all of a sudden, I felt like they had invaded my last private space.  They already knew where I lived and watched me all the time, now they broke the boundary and called me.  So I went for the unlisted number like many of my colleagues had.  Except Aliant gave me someone else’s number.  Douglas Scrage.  He seems to be a very popular person, although most of his calls are not personal friends, but business people, bill collectors, telemarketers and the like.  I have gotten about 15 calls for Douglas so far, three just yesterday.  They call and ask for him and I ask them to repeat the name, just in case it is one of my relatives who have a strong Newfie accent, mumbling my name.  Oh no, it is Douglas they want.  And when I tell them they have the wrong number, that’s where things get dicey.    “What do you mean the wrong number?  Isn’t this 625-****?”  “Yes it is, but you have the wrong number.”  “But I got it out of the directory, so it isn’t wrong.”  “Well, I am telling you it is wrong because Douglas doesn’t live here, I do and this is a new unlisted number.”  “Are you sure?”  “Yes, I am quite sure Douglas doesn’t live here.  I don’t know who Douglas is and I am most certain that there is no man named Douglas living here.”  “But I just called Directory Assistance and they gave me this number.”  “Well, they are wrong.  It’s my number, and it no longer belongs to Douglas.”  “Well, do you know how I can get in touch with him.”  “NO.  I don’t know Douglas.”  Then, if it is a telemarketer, they decide to change their prey and ask “Then can I speak to the Sir or Madam of the house?”  I answer politely “No.  Whatever you’re selling, I’m not buying.  Goodbye.”    I have to wonder if it is a ploy by Aliant to drive their customers crazy while they are on strike.  And to think, I changed my number to an unlisted one to avoid people calling me.  So I called Aliant to tell them of my difficulty and they inform me that Douglas Schrage is not in any of their directories with that number and they don’t know where people are getting it from.  “Are you sure they are asking for Douglas Schrage?”  “Yes, I am sure.”  “Well, can you spell that for us”  “Sure can, it was spelled out for me enough times.”  “Well ma’am, I don’t know what to tell you.  I found Douglas Schrage with another number.  Maybe you can give people his number when they call.”  Great, now I am his answering service.    Maybe I should have fun with this and start making up elaborate stories about Douglas, like “no, I’m sorry, Douglas has moved to the Congo to train mosquitoes to do backflips.” Or “no, Douglas is visiting Santa Claus, inspecting toys for Christmas.”  Yeah, that sounds like more fun.

       Postal Service Part 2   So I phoned the post office again this morning. Turns out I was right, my address that is at the end of my driveway on the civic sign is correct and I had the proper address on my form.  Also turns out there was a bundle of mail at their office, in another box, so they will deliver it today.  Phew.  now I know where all those  bills are...lol.  Actually when I got home and checked my box, there was only one bill and the rest were other stuff...from my old university and from the non-resident teen's future university, as well as junk mail.  Egads, I got my first mailer from Doubleday Book Club...ok, what dirty rat sold my address to them...I hadn't had anything from them since I left Newfoundland in 1997.  I think it was Columbia House.  Dirty rats.  In my mail from my university, I got yet another vinyl peel off for my car...how many can I put on my car before it begins to look ostentatious???  I have a frame for my license plate that says University of Waterloo; I have a vinyl peel off in the back window that says University of Waterloo; I have a sticker on the left passenger window that says Renison College Grad; I just got a new one last month and put it on my right passenger window that says U of W Alumni and today I got one that says Renison Alumni.  Hmmm...wherever shall I put that?  So I know where I live.  What a relief.

       Driving in Port Hawkesbury   I have been driving here for nearly two years and I am still scared.  I have driven in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Calgary and Halifax…and I was never as scared as I am when I drive here in town.  I don’t know what the problem is, but I know what the result is…people who do not know how to drive.  Common things like right of way, traffic signs, signal lights and other regular rules of the road are tossed away like schmuck.    For example, when the power goes out, everyone knows all traffic lights become four way stops…well, NOT HERE!  Look out mama, they will RUN YOU DOWN LIKE THE DOG YOU ARE.  I came back into town one day last year when the power had been out and I knew what to do…too bad I was the only one sitting at the traffic light.  Everyone else was barreling through the town, leaving those going across the highway waiting for gawd knows how long.    Another example…where I used to live, I could take one of several streets going “up the hill” in Port Hawkesbury, and because the hill is so steep, several of these streets have no stop signs, as it would be tricky to get going again in winter.  HOWEVER, there are stop signs for the roads that cross them.  This fact did not appear to be important though to people who drive here.  In fact, when I would drive up the hill, I felt like I was in shotgun alley, waiting to be nailed by the next car flying through all those stop signs.  Nearly got me three times too.    Another place that feels like shotgun alley is the Sobey’s Plaza parking lot and the Wal-Mart Mall parking lot…you think you are doing the right thing by driving in the painted lane, but bolting out of nowhere is some dumbass crossing the parking lot, not looking at what is coming down the painted lane, and WHAM, you can be the next smear on the pavement.  NO one looks where they are going…then add some snowbanks to these lots and we are in for REAL FUN.  Signal lights…why bother?  I know where I am going, and it is no one else’s business where I am going, they are only going to talk about me anyway.  OMG!  They seem to be an optional thing.  I don’t know, I am in the habit of using them all the time, even for turning into my own driveway or a parking space…is that not what they are there for?  What I really hate is people who slow down, but you have no idea why, until they begin to turn and then flick their blinker on, as if the car crossing the other lanes wasn’t clue enough by then that they were turning….or there is my personal favorite…pulling up behind someone in the inside lane who doesn’t have their signal light on, so you figure you can drive through the lights when it turns green…OH NO.  that would be too easy…as soon as the light turns green, they flick on their left turn signal and you are trapped behind them.  Lovely.  Right of way…what in the HELL is that?  I am sitting at a traffic lighted intersection…the light turns green on me and the fella across the street…right of way goes to those going straight through, or turning right and then when they are gone, left turners can go…right???  Not in Port Hawkesbury.  A green light is an opportunity to cut you off while they turn left.  Or better yet, an opportunity for someone who is turning right to sit in the opposite side of the road and wait for you to inch your way out to turn left and the light to go yellow before beginning to turn.  Look at my hand, I am signing a message for you and I can even do it left handed.  Go already.  Then there are those sweet old ladies who sit in the left turn lane, frozen in time and terrified to make that left turn in any traffic…so there I sit in a town of about 4000 people, with a rush hour that lasts 10 minutes and only 4 sets of traffic lights, waiting through four green lights while sweet old lady gets up the courage to turn left.  And then there was the time I was sideswiped coming out of the Sobey’s plaza parking lot.  I just turned right into the outside lane when WHOOSH, SCRAPE, PEEL, someone skimmed my new car.  I only had the car about 6 months.  They kept on going, looking over their shoulder and seeming unconcerned.  They were driving a very old blue car.  I was in shock, I didn’t think to get the license plate number.  I now have a chip of paint off my car and a new rusty spot…I am going to have to pay someone to fix it for me.  Aren’t I pleased.  Get me off the road already.

       Bird Watching   Well, my friend G bought me a suction cup bird feeder when I moved in here and I put it on the window of the “time out” room.  It didn’t take long before the finches showed up and I have even had a starling greedily going through it.  Mostly I see yellow finches and purple finches.  They’re quite pretty!  I haven’t had a bird feeder in ages…now I have two.  I went and bought a nice cedar one at Wal-Mart tonight, and filled it with different seed, so we shall see what I get in that tomorrow.  The resident kitty caught a glimpse of them yesterday, and thought she might jump up on the windowsill, but I was there and scolded her.  After all, I have it full of plants and she would knock the works of them off if she jumped up there…not to mention she would terrorize the birds!!!  I am considering a hummingbird feeder too, but am not sure if they are in the area.  I am becoming very country.

      So now I have to write these blogs on Word because this crappy dial-up keeps frigging up my blog posting.  I don’t know what the hell is going on.  So –  Postal Service …would imply that there is some type of service being offered, no?  Apparently it is pretty open to interpretation.  I called the local post office that I was given the number for last night – no dear, this is not your post office….here is the number for the right one.  Ok then, so I call them – well dear, where do you live exactly?  So I tell them…well, we can’t quite figure out where that is.  So I explain it to them.  I live in old Mrs P*’s house…OHHH, in there!  Well now we know where you live, but you have the wrong address…WTF?  Well, the address you gave us isn’t the right address for that house.  Um…it worked for my friend for the past two years.  Yeah, we know, but it was wrong all that time.  Ok then, what is my address?  Well, we don’t know, but what you gave us is wrong.  We will find out and call you back.  So here I sit, waiting to find out where I live.  Like I said…country life.

       Canada Post   they're great aren't they?  I've been wondering why I haven't gotten any mail since moving out here, and yet I turned in my mailbox key last week for my old address.  I paid the required $37.95 to have my mail forwarded for 6 months and handed in the form about 12 days before I turned in the keys...but still no mail.  Actually, for a week after it was to begin being forwarded, I was still getting mail, so I went in to the post office and asked them "what up" since I paid the fees to have it forwarded.  Oh, turns out they had a note taped to my box but that everyone appeared to be ignoring it so was continuing to put mail in my box.  Great.  So then she informed me she would but a blocker on the box, so no mail can go in there.  Good, then maybe I will get my mail.  NOT.  So I phoned the toll-free number on the back of my change of address form.  And I am informed that I must "register" with the local post office to let them know I am living on their route.  WTF?  I paid $37.95 to have YOU PEOPLE DO IT.  Sorry ma'am, that is just to put the stickers on your mail to reroute it.  You need to go to the post office and register for your mail.  Great.  Where in the hell is that?  I live on a rural route, but now I have to find the town it is named after.  So I ask for the post office phone number.  I hang up from Canada Post Customer service and call the number...some guy answers and tells me that oh, this isn't their number anymore, it was changed years ago when Polly something or other gave up working in the post office.  I can give you the new number - gee, thanks mister.  But they're not open, because they close at 5pm.  Oh, ok.  ahhh, Canada Post and country life...

What was mother nature thinking?  Better yet, what was my friend who used to live here thinking???  She used to feed them.  Now they screech and squawk every morning...early.  why I oughtta...

       my first Friday night   so here I am, alone with just the kitty to keep me company.  the resident teen is no longer resident...how shall I refer to her now?  the non-resident teen???  comments anyone?  "Amber" is too easy.    roomie is away for a few days with a friend.  I have been over to check on my friend's kitty and dog.  The kitty, Rupert (yes, after Rupert Boneham from Survivor Pearl Islands and Survivor All-Stars) came BOUNDING out to greet me...this kitty is a freaky one...he has what they call "monkey paws" in front - an opposable thumb of sorts, and boy is he WILD!  He miaows so loudly, its hard to believe he is just about 1.5 pounds or so.  I also checked out my friend's whirlpool bathtub...mmmm...just what this old body needed after all that moving and unpacking.    there is a sattelite dish here, with tons of channels to surf...looks like kitty and me will be curling up on the sofa, checking it out.

       UNPACKED   That's it!  I am unpacked.  I unpacked the last box just last night and BOY DOES IT FEEL GOOD.  I sewed a new set of curtains last night too and got them up so we can shut out the night now.  I am so tired though, and my feet are so tender...I need a nice jet bath...good thing I am kitty/dog sitting over the weekend where there is one...I plan on bringing a book.  Roomie has settled in and has a friend visiting from BC.  She arrived last night at 3am, and we ended up chatting until about 4:30am...the birds were singing as I went to bed...yawn.  I had not been able to sleep last night anyhow, so by the time I did go to bed, I finally slept and actually SLEPT IN!  A novel concept for me, but I stayed in bed until after 9am, which is late for me.  I don't think I will be moving again any time soon...enough of THAT.

       My singing career     so I was at this party last night, and of course, guitars were brought out and singing commenced...I had researched a song for a friend and he didn't quite know the tune, so I sang it with him, along with another and there I was, at a party, singing and I wasn't even drunk.  I was on-call, so had not been drinking, so was very pleased with myself that I even took that plunge in front of such a gathering of people.  I have no talent of course, but I at least carried the tune somewhat respectably and I had the words in front of me, so didn't fool that up too much.  One of the songs I sang was the Rubber Boot Song, listed below:    Rubber Boot Song       I'm a hardy old sailor from Newfoundland's shore,    I've fished for me livin' on the wild Labrador;    Now the fishin's all over, me work is all done,    And I'm goin' out tonight with me rubber boots on.       So I ate up me supper and I shaved off me beard,    For courtin' indeed I was highly prepared;    With the day's work all over and the night comin' on,    I remember that night with me rubber boots on.       I knocked on her door and me knock it was low,    And out of her slumber my knock she did know;    She came to the door and said "Is that you, Tom?"    "It is, love," said I, "with me rubber boots on."       She opened the door and invited me in,    And into her bedroom she invited me in;    She jumped on the bed with the blankets rolled on,    And I hopped in beside her with me rubber boots on.       Well, daylight next mornin' with the sun in the sky,    I turned to me true love to say goodbye;    She said "Don't you leave me, don't you know you done wrong,    For you slept here all night with your rubber boots on."       I turned to me true love with a wink and a smile,    I said, "Nothing could happen in such a short while;    Whatever I did, love, I did it for fun."    And I hopped out of bed with me rubber boots on.       It being nine months later I was summoned to court,    Ten shillings a week I was fined for me sport;    Ten shillings a week from a fisherman's son,    I regretted that night with me rubber boots on.       Ah, but now I'm back fishin', I'm happy for sure,    I'll make them ten shillings on the wild Labrador;    And when he gets bigger I'll take 'long me son,    And he'll catch those codfish with his rubber boots on.   dontcha just love it?

       The dumbest movie ever   okay, how do you know you have just watched the dumbest movie ever? When it makes so little sense, the writing is terrible, and the acting is even worse. That's how I feel after watching New Hampshire Hotel. And to make the best of it, it had some really good actors in it...but this was not their best performance. You would think that a movie with Rob Lowe, Jodie Foster, Beau Bridges, Nastassja Kinski,  here are some of the dumb highlights - contains spoilers, although I would never recommend seeing this movie anyhow  - a dog called Sorrow that they have put down because he farts too much, but they miss him so the son gets him back from the vet and has him stuffed. He gets the dog wet, so tries to dry him out, catches him on fire so leaves him in the tub to soak. The dog even gets taken to Europe when they move there.  - there is an unnatural attraction between Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe who play brother and sister. She gets raped at one point by a bunch of lettermen from her school, but very little is made of it afterwards, except that she is in love with the lead rapist. and her brother is in love with her...very flowers in the attic  - one of the daughters is a self-proclaimed dwarf because she has stopped growing, but yet looks normal  - they are good friends with Freud, who looks suspiciously like Rick Moranis, but is actually Wallace Shawn (???)  - one of the sons is gay, and gets beat up all the time by the lettermen - this dude is played by Paul McCrane, aka Rocket Romano from the tv series ER.  - and then there was the sister of one of Rob Lowe's black friends who was all over Rob, and then took her teeth out to show him how to kiss "real deep", then was seen throughout the rest of the movie, gums showing  anyhow, do not bother to waste your time on this crappy movie. I am just sorry I wasted mine and my $6.88 at Wal-Mart.

        Happy Birthday to Kitty         hard to say that without feeling a little like Bubbles from the Trailer Park Boys...lol.  But alas, she is 7 years old today, along with 2 of Amber's cousins wo are 24 today.  As well, 7 years ago, I was still living in Newfoundland, about to leave for good and move to Ontario.  I think I left just 5 days later, on the 12th.  Where have those 7 years gone?  I remember when she was born, and we still had her mother - Pretty.  Now Pretty is gone (had to be put down a year after the move), living in Newfoundland is a distant memory,  my university education is behind me, I am divorced, and my daughter has grown up and moved on.  That's quite the wrap-up of the last 7 years.  I wonder what the next 7 will hold?

        The Hammock          Well, as previously posted, I bought a hammock.  You would think it would be a FUN thing, but it has turned into my nemesis.  I bought this beautiful parachute cloth hammock from Nomad's Land and thought I had the perfect hanging place for it.  I have a pine tree not far from my house, and the clothesline pole is just the right distance from it that I could use those ends to hang the hammock from.  So I get a ring bolt, nearly twist my arm off winding that into the clothesline pole; get some nylon rope that I had from camping and tie onto the tree (I didn't want to put anything INTO the tree).  The rope stretches a bit, but I adjust it and its fine.  Jump into the hammock...a little rocking of the clothesline pole, but nothing serious.  Ahhhh...swinging in the hammock in the shade of the summer.  Then PLOP.  A big goober of tree sap.  That's odd, I didn't know pine trees lost much sap, but as it turns out, I have been ignorant of this fact.  another PLOP.  Well, that's it for this spot.  I don't want to have to shower off and wash the hammock each time I use it.       So then I scan the yard and wonder if the apple trees farther back are too far apart.  Turns out I had just enough rope to hang from either end and string the hammock inbetween.  Ahhhh...just right...I get into the hammock and the rope STRETCHES beyond belief and I am on the ground.  in my hammock.  So I tighten it up as much as I can, and have to climb into it at 4 feet high, and still it stretches onto the ground.  Dammit.  The rope is too stretchy.  Time to scope out a shorter distance.        So I stroll about the yard, looking for a good spot and wonder about the ash tree in the front yard, next to the patio.  hmmm...I wrestle the rope onto the trunk of the ash tree, and tie it also onto the patio.  It works!  Ahhh...just right.  swinging in my hammock in the coolness of the evening, watching the sun set.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ   mosquitoes...uh-oh, not enough bug spray apparently.  So I douse again.  They stay away from me, but swarm the hammock on the outside.  So I gracelessly plunk out of the hammock yet again and get the citronella buckets.  The mosquitoes begin to ease off and then SWOOOOSHHH!  A bat flew over my head under the branches of the tree.  Ok.  I'm done.  Stupid hammock.

        My Weekend Getaway    Just what I needed after 2 weeks on-call!  I headed out to Halifax shortly after I finished up some things at work and got to see my girl again!  The non-resident teen and I took off for the grocery store to do her shopping, since it is such a drag to lug around groceries on the bus…I remember it well.  It was great just seeing her, knowing I had the whole weekend to spend there.  After grocery shopping, we picked up the boyfriend and went out for supper….first stop was Montana’s but it was so crowded with a waif of 45 minutes, we went elsewhere to East Side Mario’s, an old favorite from Waterloo.  The food was quite good, and service just as good.  We were so stuffed when we left.  After that we headed over to the pet store where the cozy couple wanted to add to their “family” by buying a snake…that is until they saw how expensive they were and found out how big they get.  So IXNAY on the snake, and some consideration for a leopard gecko, which was still out of budget range.  I convinced them to at least wait through the weekend and see if they still want to spend that kind of money on a pet, especially one that they would have to truck to the pet store every week to buy crickets for.  They reconsidered and decided no go for now.  Saturday we spent shopping around town for things for all of us…they bought a barbecue so we went back to the steaming apartment to make potato salad to go with the steaks we planned on grilling that night.  I also bought the happy couple a beautiful print for their living room as a housewarming gift.  My friend and her daughter were in from Waterloo for the week, so over they came, as well as Amber’s cousin, Belinda and we had a lovely dinner.  After that, we headed over to her hotel to take a dunk in the pool to cool off and it was amazing.  The younguns also went in the sauna and the hot tub, then cooled off again outside.   Sunday was all about touring – my friend and her daughter piled into my car and we drove along some of the south shore – Peggy’s Cove, Mahone Bay, and Lunenburg.  It was fabulous weather and we saw a lot in a short time.  We even went to the beach at Queensland, where it was wonderful to swim.  When we got back that night, we rested up and then I drove down to the waterfront with the younguns again and watched the fireworks.  They were awesome, but very short.  There was one young kid there standing just behind me that cracked me up – he was obviously from Toronto – that TO accent is hard to miss, and he said partway through the display – “you’d never get THIS in Toronto, would you dad?” and then as they kept shooting them up into the air, he commented “how on earth do they afford this?  They just keep going and going!”  This kid was about 7 years old.  It was hilarious!  They had some fabulous fireworks that I hadn’t seen before, but it only lasted about 10 minutes or so.   This morning, I packed up the younguns again and took them out to breakfast at Smittys…we stuffed ourselves, AGAIN, and then I headed for home.  It will be nice to sleep in a bed again tonight.  I tried it on the leather loveseat at their place…which was comfy enough, but leather is noisy and HOT to sleep on in such weather, so I didn’t get much sleep the first night.  The next day I headed out in search of a   urlLink hammock   and bought a cheap one at Canadian Tire and two hooks.  I slept somewhat better the next night, but got a little chilled.  Apparently you need just as much blankets underneath as you do above J .  So last night I was prepared and actually had a pretty good nights sleep…except for the dumbass above us who played heavy metal at 3am and talked to himself all night…but the earplugs filtered out most of that.  I even bought a   urlLink hammock   for myself, a much nicer one made of parachute cloth.  I had a little swing in it earlier today, but the horseflies were driving me mad, and it was too hot out.  Tonight will be GREAT!  Its hanging right under the tree next to the house…hope the birds don’t poop on me.
