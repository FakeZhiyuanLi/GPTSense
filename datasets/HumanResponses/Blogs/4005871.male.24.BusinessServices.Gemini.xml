      I happened to tune into the DNC last night to hear John Kerry squawking about what a middle class champion he is, and how he's going to give the average man a break, and 'roll back' tax cuts on the wealthy.  This resulted in much cheering from the crowd of liberal onlookers, who somehow thought that raising taxes on the wealthy was a good thing.  Kerry of course proclaimed that this money is needed to fund wonderful things like stem cell research and educational programs.  This is a perfect example of how mislead and indoctrinated these people are.  Instead of seeing wealth as the American dream, and seeking to protect our right to wealth, they choose the typical liberal selfishness and embrace a government that seeks to redistribute the wealth to more people.  Don't people realize how socialistic these ideals are?  If there is any lesson that can be learned from social history, it is that socialism doesn't work.  Kerry and his cronies just want to expand the government, give more handouts to more people, and try to make it sound like they are the country's savior.  Don't even mention the fact that the wealthy already pay a much higher tax percentage than the average American.  These hypocrites tout American values as a cornerstone of their campaign while seeking to punish those who are successful entrepreneurs.  Our country is founded on the principals of individual opportunty and freedom from a meddling government.  Liberals want to fix our problems by redistributing wealth via social programs that will "help everybody".  Let's just call it what it is:  socialism.  Karl Marx would be proud.

He simply says whatever people want to hear. &nbsp;  &#8220;We need a stronger       America      &#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s time for things to change&#8221;, &#8220;Improve the economy&#8221;, &#8220;Fix healthcare&#8221;. &nbsp;  Well yeah ok, that&#8217;s what anyone would say. &nbsp;  People claim they are tired of politics and the showboating, but then the same people simply embrace whoever does the best job of showboating; whoever can drop the most keywords in one sentence. &nbsp;  How shallow have we gotten?!!           &nbsp;         Given that a large majority of Americans are just being blindly led by the liberal agenda that&#8217;s on the daily news and an overwhelming urge to worship political correctness, isn&#8217;t it interesting that the country is still about 50/50 on the presidential election? &nbsp;  What I&#8217;m saying is imagine that the liberal press was gone, and no longer targeting the growing number of brain-washable Americans. &nbsp;  The support for Kerry would be much, much less. &nbsp;  Bush doesn&#8217;t have the advantage of being worshipped by the press. &nbsp;  Every problem       America       has is trumpeted, while the good is understated. &nbsp;  Still he has the support of at least half of       America      .           &nbsp;         Dumb, gullible people need to wake up and realize that we can&#8217;t blame everything on people just because they aren&#8217;t giving us every handout that we wanted. &nbsp;  I for      one am      glad that Bush doesn&#8217;t bow to every special interest that comes his way, like Kerry certainly does and would as President. &nbsp;  Oh boo- hoo  our economy is bad. &nbsp;  How dare Bush crash those planes into the WTC and plunge consumer confidence  down.  &nbsp;  How dare he have any relation with oil  companies.  &nbsp;  He must have made our gas prices high, bad Bush. &nbsp;  The economy is much more complicated than the whims of one man, idiots. &nbsp;  Some people would still say that the war is the sole cause of all our problems, and that it was all about oil. &nbsp;   Ludicrous.  &nbsp;  And what the hell is Kerry going to do better? &nbsp;  Go ahead and regurgitate the rhetoric. &nbsp;  It&#8217;s all hollow, and you pathetic puppets continue to follow whoever is able to state the same  bullsh ** and make it sound the best. &nbsp;  Even that a-hole voted for many of the things Bush is being assaulted for. &nbsp;  Oh wait I forgot &#8211; any problem we have must be the fault of the President right? &nbsp;   God almighty.            &nbsp;         I for one will be voting for someone who makes an effort to do what he thinks is best for the country, not for the press, and not for each and every special interest and activist in       America       (and      Europe      for that matter). &nbsp;  We don&#8217;t have time for Liberal utopian lies and rhetoric.

      Sometimes I catch myself wishing my life away.  This week is one of those times when I'm not really thinking backwards or ahead, but just kind of taking it as it comes.  Most of the time, however, I'm wishing it was Friday as soon as it's Monday.  When I have vacation coming up I wish it was time for vacation.  As soon as I'm back at work I ignore all the time in between and look forward to my next vacation.  Living life a weekend at a time just gets old.  No wonder time goes so much faster after college.  The sheer boredom of it all is just too much!   aaahhhh!!!!!!  On the bright side, someone has finally taken notice of the fact that I'm a sexy beast.  To protect the innocent I'll refer to her only as KIM.  Her last name may or may not be STEWART.  Many thanks to this wonderful person... whoever it is!

      I have had the weirdest morning.  I felt really tired and really felt like nodding off, but just as I started to I shook myself awake and felt like I was in the twighlight zone.  I was having weird deja-vu like feelings and jumbled thoughts that made no sense.  I don't know if I'm having a stroke or am just tired.  Sometimes I don't think I'll live to see 30.  Oh well, back to the report-making.

      This is kind of a continuation of the last post.&nbsp; I rail pretty hard on the consequences of popularity, and what tends to happen to those people.&nbsp; I was usually alienated by popular kids when I was younger, so the grudge is still there to some degree.&nbsp; The fact is, popularity is really not a bad thing.&nbsp; The attitude that comes from popularity is the problem.&nbsp; I have actually known a good number of people who did not let popularity go to their head, and have a lot of respect for them.  When it comes to the  urlLink popular Christian&nbsp;girls  syndrome, I feel like they are wasting what they have on something worthless.&nbsp; Again, not all popular girls are like this, but its just so easy to become the next fashion victim, particularly at the high-school age.&nbsp; I knew&nbsp;girls when I was&nbsp;in HS&nbsp;that just&nbsp;consumed themselves on whatever was coolest at the time, and its no different today.&nbsp; What a waste.&nbsp; Younger guys are the same way... its like a disease.&nbsp; A disease that if not reversed by the time they enter the real world may control their whole life.  I hate watching people I actually care about and think&nbsp;highly of&nbsp;becoming that kind of person.&nbsp; Of course there's usually still time to mature and get over it, but that doesn't always happen.&nbsp; For all the gifts and good qualities they have, they choose to overshadow it with bad attitudes and superiority complexes.&nbsp; Its not as disgusting as it is sad, and I wish I could do something to change it.&nbsp; For now I can just be content to write it down. :-/

      Just thought I'd mention&nbsp;something regarding the personality&nbsp;criticisms I've done ( urlLink Popular Girls ,  urlLink First Rant ).  I am not trying to single out any one person.&nbsp; These are pretty general things that I've noticed all the way from middle school through college and beyond.&nbsp; And just because I hate something a person does, doesn't mean that I hate the person.&nbsp; That's just not right either.  With that being said, if&nbsp;you happen to read something in here that you disagree with, please comment on it.&nbsp; I am just&nbsp;complaining about stuff that drives  me  nuts,&nbsp;so&nbsp;of course it's opinionated too.&nbsp; Anyone openly reading anything in here should not be offended -&nbsp;I'm venting,&nbsp;not trying to libel anyone's good name (heh, at least I don't think I will).&nbsp; Besides, I'm going to write it like I&nbsp;feel in here.&nbsp; What fun is it to be politically correct in your own blog?  To those who may take offense:&nbsp; Are you&nbsp;offended&nbsp;because I said something outright false, or&nbsp;did&nbsp;I strike a personal nerve? &nbsp;If it's the latter, then just take it as honest criticism and move on.&nbsp; Like I said, it's venting, and&nbsp;I still see plenty of&nbsp;the good qualities people have.&nbsp; Hey sometimes my own friends get on my nerves, just like I get on theirs.&nbsp; That's just life.

      Have you ever been to a&nbsp;small-town carnival?&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to think of it, is there ever a carnival in a  big  town?&nbsp; Anyway, with the local carnival being this week, I met my obligations of showing up a couple times for funnel cakes and gambling on the good 'ol fireman's wheel (which schooled me this year, btw).&nbsp; There are two things I noticed.&nbsp; The first being that every year the exact same stuff is there in the exact same location.&nbsp; I mean come on, change it up a little!&nbsp; The other is that the median age is about 15,&nbsp;give or take a year&nbsp;depending on&nbsp;the night.&nbsp; If you want to see the future&nbsp;Stew-town sluts-in-training, you need go no further than the town carnival.   I swear the age at which you can dress like a hooker and get away with it is down to 12 this year.&nbsp; For the sake of your dignity people put some clothes on!&nbsp; If I was 16 (or younger) it would be great, but instead there's enough jailbait every few feet to put a man away for 5 lifetimes.&nbsp; Its like a mall on speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before&nbsp;the inevitable&nbsp;"Oh my god I can't believe you were checking out little girls you dirty old man!", I just want to point out that I did no such thing.&nbsp; Guys are however wired to notice what women like to show off, and when 14-year-olds dress like 24-year-olds, an occasional&nbsp;double-take is almost certain.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;girlies knew what was good for you, you'd stop trying to attract so much attention because the only attention that will come is bad.&nbsp; Why don't you just wear a sign around your neck that says "Attention pervs and horny 16-year-old boys, I want to be taken advantage of!" I mean come on, did you think anything good could come out of looking like a 'ho?   I&nbsp;may be out of line here, but if a girl wants to be treated with respect she really should show a little more respect for herself.&nbsp; Take some responsibility for attracting the wrong kind of attention - there is a choice and men are not the only ones to blame.   On a side-note, I do believe that there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;a guy or girl being with someone&nbsp;several years apart in&nbsp;age.&nbsp; The point is, the chance of something good actually coming from flaunting yourself all over the place is pretty slim.&nbsp; Well I'm glad that&nbsp;problem is&nbsp;taken care of, on to something else...

          I thought this was a pretty good rant, and while I don’t agree with every part of it, there is a lot of truth in it.          &nbsp;  urlLink Ode to the Nice Guys             &nbsp;     Here's a great article from askmen.com about the dilemma I've&nbsp;noticed all too frequently:&nbsp;  urlLink Women want a sensitive jerk. &nbsp;           &nbsp;    I found these links while reading the forums at  urlLink  eNotAlone   - lots of good people there discussing issues that many of us can relate to.

      Here is a dated post I jotted down once, which I will put up here just as evidence that I am not a totally ice-cold, emotionless dick.&nbsp; Note that&nbsp;my despair probably sounds worse&nbsp;in writing&nbsp;than it ever was in my mind:    What does it mean when just the thought of talking to someone or being in the same room as them can make you smile inside? What does it mean when that person is too far out of your league to even think about being close to? Is it unhealthy to hope for what you feel is impossible, yet wish for with every breath you take? What if there was a 1% chance of the dream coming true? 1/2%? 1 in a million? When is it too ridiculous to even acknowledge? If it is never too late, then how can you live with a hope so slim and still keep your chin up? And if it is simply a nonsensical waste of time, then how can you make your mind stop thinking about it? Is there any way to have peace of mind knowing what you will never have? All while being surrounded by reminders of what your heart desperately longed for? How could I ever forgive myself for letting such a thing go? How could I ever forgive myself for being such a fool as to pursue it?

      A couple thoughts I had written prior to today... they're related to my existing posts so why the hell not share 'em?!:  Disturbing, but true: I know more manipulative, pretentious Christian women than non-Christians.&nbsp; Same old game, just hiding behind the supposed cloak of righteousness as if it makes them better than their mainstream counterparts.&nbsp; If anyone can explain to me why this is, I'm all ears.&nbsp; Beliefs should bring people together WITH THEIR FAULTS, not nit-pick them apart.&nbsp; The day you are perfect, you can expect me to be perfect.  It seems to me that unbending conservative values cause more unnecessary tension and lost focus than the relative values popular today.&nbsp; Relative values may heatedly argue about where money is best spent, or what the consequences of drugs are, while unbending conservative values heatedly argue about whether 'piss' is a swear word.

      (Read this related post:&nbsp; urlLink popularity isn't bad ) There is nothing worse than a popular Christian girl.&nbsp; The girl that always must be around the most popular crowd, doing whatever is most popular at the time.&nbsp; Quick to point out the faults of anyone they see as below them, often backing up their spiteful words with God, as if he would approve.&nbsp; Still they choose to be with people whose lifestyles are often more questionable than those they criticize.&nbsp; In the end they wonder why it is so hard to find decent Christian people to befriend or to date, but is it really a mystery?&nbsp; Instead of truly seeking this type of person, they prefer to reject a Christian who is not good enough for them and instead try to convert someone who has no beliefs at all.&nbsp; As if the non-Christian's problems are easier to overlook since they "don't know any better".&nbsp; The girl, in typical form, picks the coolest, most 'sensitive' guy she can find - meaning the guy who is most willing to spin some line about reading his Bible, or spouting some quasi-religious rhetoric that they think will convince her of their true appreciation for her beliefs.&nbsp; Beliefs they could care less about if the girl wasn't a "nice piece".&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; Part of me feels bad when girl finds out that boy doesn't really have much character.&nbsp; But as time goes on, it seems more like they deserve what they get.&nbsp; If character is important, why doesn't the Christian Girl try to see past the faults of the Christian men around them, who will be a hundred times more likely to grow in the right direction?&nbsp; Sometimes they come back around, but all too often, the downward spiral never ends and another attractive girl's good personality is lost forever, leaving nothing for the man that actually cares about character.&nbsp; There is something that needs to be said to these people:&nbsp; "Make up your mind!"   Call me a complainer on this one, but it's just not right.&nbsp; Even with non-Christians, any hot girl is destined to become a friggin snob or a 'ho, leaving nothing but those who  have  to be decent people cuz they're unattractive.&nbsp; Is it too much to ask for&nbsp;looks  and  character?&nbsp; Hahaha... how silly of me to even ask.

       Hmm I can already tell that this is going to get boring fast.&nbsp; Before I get too bored, I'm going to post some thoughts I have already written down.&nbsp; Mostly about the lackluster world of women and the complications of Christianity.&nbsp; Coming in a later edition:&nbsp; Is it possible to&nbsp;be an Agnostic and a Christian&nbsp;at the same time?&nbsp; Ha, we'll see if I actually get into THAT crap. :-)   Being the ranting blog that this is, how about a list of my top 3 pet peeves?&nbsp; They are rather general, and closely related, but they are:    1. Ignorance. &nbsp; Of course we all have our moments, but there is a limit.&nbsp; There is nothing worse than sheer stupididy and those who act like they know $h!t but don't... Which brings me to the next one:    2. Arrogance. &nbsp; "I'm better than you.&nbsp; I'm cooler than you.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;more than you.&nbsp;  I refuse to admit when&nbsp;I'm wrong no matter what you say .&nbsp; I am&nbsp;the&nbsp;all-knowing&nbsp;arrogant prick."    3. Self-Righteousness. &nbsp; This really goes hand-in-hand with number 2, but has a life all its own.&nbsp; Being a Christian, I am all too familiar with the world of judgmental&nbsp;characters and the lunatic fringe of conservatism that enjoy blowing every&nbsp;little thing out of proportion.&nbsp; Anyone who thinks they&nbsp;are making the world a better place&nbsp;by nit-picking at every thing they see as bad is fooling themselves.&nbsp; The self-righteous are seldom able to draw the line between the black and white of morality and the greyer world of their opinion.&nbsp; Accustomed to using religion (or some other means)&nbsp;to justify everything they say, they  ignorantly  and  arrogantly  begin to believe that their opinion is always in the right, even on the most insignificant issues.&nbsp; Ahh, the flashbacks to LU! (LeTourneau University - my college)   And finally, before I close this rant, I want to give a disclaimer of sorts:&nbsp; I complain a lot about things.&nbsp; But the reason I complain is because it bothers me.&nbsp; If I rail on Christianity too much, just remember that it is naturally a very important issue to me and problems with it are troublesome to me.&nbsp; No matter how negative a posting may be, I cannot give up my basic belief in the God that must exist, and the Christ that gives life the only meaning it sometimes seems to have.&nbsp; Without that destiny and assurance, what is even the point of being alive?    Life sucks, and earth is a&nbsp;hole,&nbsp;but at least we won't be on it forever!  :-)

      ... and should remember that.  I hope everyone else in the world is as pissed as me when spoiled, ignorant, and hopelessly naive musicians decide to make political statements at concerts.  These people have the least credentials of anyone alive to be speaking about what is right for the world, because they live in a little isolated fantasy world.  And it's always liberal too.  What is it about money, fame, and ignorance that makes people flock to liberalism?  Oh wait... its the ignorance part.  The money just makes them more self-important and feel more isolated from reality.  Liberalism's appeal is its ability to make (naive) people believe that perfect social harmony is an obtainable goal, usually by means of political correctness and redistribution of power.  A complicated way to say socialism... or communism.  Its the same basic premise.  And don't even get me started on the war thing.  Entertainers somehow seem to think that the answer is ALWAYS to sit on our asses.  Their policy is always to do nothing.  They have no concept of the fact that complacency works for today, but destroys us tomorrow.  Nothing like telling our enemies that we won't do anything to them no matter what.  You can give whatever reason you want why war is wrong, but it always boils down to this:  Nobody likes it, and there will always be mistakes.  That doesn't mean we should pretend that we can remain free by being complacent pussies about foreign policy.  Ok, well that was a refreshing load of politics wasn't it?  All to say this:   You entertainers are the most collectively stupid group of people in America... your opinions are of no more value than a toilet full of corn-logs.   Hmm... that gave me one final thought, another "isn't it interesting": Isn't it interesting that the group of people that are most widely acknowledged to be ignorant,  are overwhelmingly liberal, not to mention tree-hugging hippy peace protesters?  If the stupidest people embrace these values, isn't that worth noting?  Maybe note that they are misguided at best and usually WRONG?  I vote for Yes on that one.

      I went to the almighty Vans Warped Tour today, and can only come to one conclusion:  This tour is for angsty high school kiddies.  You know, the kind that think making their hair look like they just got out of bed five times in a row gives them a new sense of depth.  Sorry, you just can't be cool if you look like a fag, I don't care what band you listen to, or how many cigarettes you smoke.  The sluttage was of course everywhere, but unlike the carnival it was all pathetic punks - the kind that could make hippies look reasonable.  Aside from Story of the Year, and maybe Yellowcard, I didn't see much that gives me the desire to return next year for Trend-Tour 2005.  It's too watered down anyway - with like 50 bands and 4 stages over an entire day, you don't get nearly the solid experience as you do from a good headliner.
