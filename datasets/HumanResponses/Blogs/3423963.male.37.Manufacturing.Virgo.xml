      Well its just after 10 and I have been up for 3 hrs, im still undecided as to what im gonna do today. I want to wash the car...... but i want to take the kids out for the day and the weather could turn.   decisions, decisions lol.  Ho-hum the pub sounds like a good idea to me ;)  Back to work again tomorrow, SSDD. I have to find a new job, the one I have is so bloody boring and is a path to no-where, im a skilled wood machinist and the company supplies furniture to the hotel trade and just about anyone else who'll buy it. But it is something I have been doing for the best part of 18 years, im not getting any younger and the job is getting harder, IE: timber and board products seem heavier to me (or is that age creeping up on me lol) Time for a ciggie, brb.   ***edit*** Well it has been decided by the powers above (the missus) that were gonna be going to the coast, lunch on the way and Skegness for 2pm :) no drinking though as im gonna be driving, shit it never goes the way i want lol, still it should be a good day.

      Well Skegness on Monday was ok I suppose, eldest step-daughter wanted the wristband for the rides, so like shep heading off for the dip we all stood in a nice neat orderly line and awaited our turn. When we get to the kiosk she changes her mind, typical of Jen, anything to do with "FUN, EXCITEMENT, or being a kid she shuns it" To old before her time if you ask me, she's an intelligent 13yr old but acts like a 40yr old.  Played crazy golf and went home, pretty exciting dont ya think :p  Nothing of much interest happened during the week, got up a 5am, went to work, came home, vegged out and went to bed. Oh what a exciting life i lead. And so comes round saturday. I hope to get some stuf done in the garden today, just waiting on the weather.  We have a busy week coming up, my step-father was cremated a few weeks ago and mum picks up the ashes on monday, so on wednesday Zonya the kids and I are going down to mums when she takes the ashes to be burried in the family plot and on saturday I am going to see my kids (from a prev relationship) as its my son's birthday on the sunday.  I'll see how things are later today and I might pop back in to post, but then I might not lol, such and indesiceive(sp) git aint I lol. I think I'll have meself a cuppa now :)  ttfn   9.30pm  Just had dinner, yum yum...... and I ate to much ice cream an I feel icky, gonna go to bed and feel sorry for me stomach. I have been watching X-Files when I go to bed, over the past 5 weeks or so I have worked through all 9 series with just 7 episodes to go. My missus (Zonya) and I have a large collection of DVD's and video's so most nights we watch something or 'tother. Today I received from the BBC Shop Micheal Palins 3rd adventure, Full Circle. Managed to watch the first 8 episodes today and i'll watch the last 2 when I get up in the morning, Zonya isnt to keen on some of the stuff I like and doesnt see things as I do where TV programs are concerned. She's watching Friends "The best voted" episodes on Channel 4 or is it T4 so I got a few minutes before I actually go up to bed. I think for tomorrows exercise I'll make a few comments on how I see our once great country being run by the current government. adios amigo's
