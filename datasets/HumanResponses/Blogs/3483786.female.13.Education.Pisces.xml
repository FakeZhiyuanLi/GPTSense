       Ashvin broke his kneecap. But that isnt whats makin me sad -- i laff at his pain. I mean, im supposed to leave england on the 25th. Coz of his knee, its the 18th. Now his family isnt coming and my mom isnt making it easier by telling me i got to go bakk on the 18th ALL COZ OF HIS STUPID FUCKING KNEE AND HIS STUPID FUCKING FAMILY. seriously fuck them.  Ok, thats bad. I can live with that.  BUT its so horrible esp. when its mixed with the Vikram thing and the Inderjit thing. I so cant believe it. He is RUINING my LIFE all of them Is there lyk, a ''lets all make ash mad'' club around? Coz i dont get angry easily This -- i really am gonna cry. I wouldnt mind living here PERMANENTLY. WITHOUT ASHVIN OR ARVIN OR THE FUCKING FAMILY IN FUCKING SINGAPORE. Argh!  /*-Garethlova
