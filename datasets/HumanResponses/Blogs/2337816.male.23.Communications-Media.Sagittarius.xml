       Give me a whisper, and give me a sigh, give me a kiss before you, tell me goodbye...   I'm sitting here listening to Guns N' Roses' ' Don't Cry '...hence the references to the song...  Rina flew back into town to celebrate my birthday...decided to celebrate it this weekend cos nobody has time to celebrate on a monday...I wasn't expecing her to return since we had that bad argument last week...I'd hafta say it was a pleasant surprise though...  We talked our situation over and I guess the time is just not right for us to be together...maybe it's the distance involved, maybe it's my fear of commitment...who knows...but i think it would've worked out had she not gone back home to jakarta...  Remember your first kiss? Well...I'd hafta say that our final kiss was like that...there was somethin special about it...now I'm sitting here with a stupid grin on my face...  I guess it was a fitting finale to '2003 chapter of us'...I kinda hope when we try again someday it will work out differently...  As for the subject of moving on...I don't think it'll happen anytime soon...I quote Rita on this one :   Joe, you fall in love easy but you fall out of love hard...   You know what? I think she's right...   Don't you take it so hard now, and please don't take it so bad. I'll still be thinkin of you, and the time's we've had baby...

       It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...   Well it's official, Xmas is beginning to rear it's ugly head again...for me @ least...mom just put the tree up earlier today...What's up w/ the tree anyway...From what i know there weren't any pine trees in Bethlehem...  Xmas has no meaning here in Singapore, here Xmas is about buying gifts and lookin @ the Christmas light up along Orchard Road...what a whole load of BS!  As you can tell I'm not really a devout Catholic...to put it simply, I'm a non-practising Catholic due to the way I see my religion being 'used & abused' by some of my church-going peers...I could launch into a tirade against the more youthful members of the congregation right now if you want me to...but I just don't give a f%*k...so to hell with it...  Xmas is the time I make my yearly pilgrimmage to the Church carpark...you read right...the Church carpark...like I said...let's just go through the motions...hafta do it appease mom and dad...cos the last thing they need is an argument during the holidays...  So if you think I'm goin to hell..gimme a 'HELL YEAH!!!"  It's still a month away...so I'm pretty sure I've more stuff to spew regarding Xmas...  Oh yeah...for you kids out there...Santa Claus don't exist...think about it...  For the record, I believe in God, but not in religion...

       Another one bites the dust...   And so another one succumbs to a sports injury...Sky, my friend from my tennis team days @ junior college, seems lookin to me for advice with regards to his suspected torn anterior cruciate ligament...  Though I'm somewhat a veteran in the serious 'mobility threatening' injury department...I feel that I'm the last person who should give him pointers on this issue...Remember, he didn't ask for this injury, he got hurt while playing soccer...I, on the other hand, somewhat brought my injury upon myself, due to an act of 'gross negligence' on my part...  Since we're on the subject, my surgeon's green light to my jogging has finally paid dividends...got to jog another 18 minutes on the treadmill today....hey I'm not out to set new records or somethin...it just feels good to find out that all those hours of physiotherapy are paying off...On an even better note, I won't be back for another check-up til the middle of next year...such a refreshing change from the monthly hospital visits during pre-op...  I think i gotta bail now...the Dynamo Kyiv - Lokomotiv Moscow match is now  at 2-3...helluva match...though I have no idea who thier players are...  Vicarious living is such a bitch isn't it?

       Same shit, different day   Here we go again, the beginning of another new week...pretty much spent the day like any other...life pretty much revolves around my bed, cable tv, ps2 and the post-workout poolside chat sessions...today on the agenda = my recent breakup and my 10mth hiatus...  Most of my friends say they'd kill to be in my shoes, but then again they don't understand what I've been thru to get here...it's unlikely they'd undergo 2 major operations in a year anyway...  Looks like I should just enjoy the remaining 7 weeks of my 10 month long hiatus...afterall..it's back to the books once classes start next year...but looking @ my schedule, looks like I'm gonna be in my 'relaxed' state again...  For the third day in a row I've been screening calls from my ex-gf...it's not that i don't wanna speak to her...i guess i just need some time to review what has happened these past few days...hmm...i think i better shut off the cd player...bon jovi's 'always' is playin in the background...hardly the tunes you'd wanna hear if your trying to get your love life straightened out...

       Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars   Well it's the last coupla days of filming left...and I hafta say that I've developed a crush on one of those whom I'm working with...for the record, I'm not talking abt the actresses, but someone who works behind the scenes...Let's be honest here...the actresses are way outta my league...  I'm never one to mix business with pleasure, so I guess I'll just hafta wait til the whole project is over to make my move...  I don't know whether I really like her or not, or is it just a passing thing just because I'm almost single for about a month now...sigh...Then again it could just be the season getting to me...you know...Christmas, celebrating with your significant other...that kinda shit...  But as usual...Good ol Joe has to compare a potential target to the previous girlfriend...I know it's bad...but hey..old habits die hard...  Was listening to Bon Jovi's Crush album on the way home...and unfortunately it had our favorite song on it...so inevitably I began thinking of her...  Well to be honest, I haven't completely gotten over her yet...and I think she knows it too...  I don't know if this is a normal reflex to stop me from getting back onto the dating band wagon too soon...but then again if I don't move on now...when will I move on?   You and me, we're invincible, together We can be, oh so tragical, whatever We're Sid and Nancy  Fred and Ginger  Clyde and Bonnie  Liz and Richard  Kurt and Courtney  Bacall and Bogie  Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe  Here's Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars

       Everybody's got their dues to pay...   And so my long journey on the road towards my dream begins...Hafta say after 6 straight days of work...I'm still happy to get down to the set even though i'm fuckin stoned...sometimes getting as little as 3hours of zzz nightly...well...that's 6days down, 6 days to go....I hope...  Imagine the long hours, early call times and late wrap times...I get up as early as 630 in the morning and sometimes don't get home til about 230am....as a matter of fact last night the shoot lasted til about 145...  Even though that sounds like extremely bad working conditions...I'd hafta say that I think I've found my true calling...and I believe that I'm off on the right foot for a successful career in the industry...  The first few days of the shoot went well...picked up a whole lotta stuff about cameras and the procedures to go through when shooting a scene... Even the director said that he's very impressed with my professionalism and my drive to learn from this opportunity that he's given me...even going as far as praising me in front of the actors....WOW...that's one helluva compliment comin' from him...  I'll never forget what he said...   This guy is good, blah blah blah....he'll make a terrific director someday...but right now he has to eat shit and die   Boy was he right...For the last 2 days I've been the production assistant who takes care of everything...and I mean everything...yesterday got my first stint as the food and coffee boy...god damn...it's hard to keep track of who's coming and going...can you imagine yourself getting food for 12 people, only to find out 3 more arrived while you were away?  Well the director was right on the money for the latter part of his quote...now it's up to me to make that former part come true...

       Does anyone out there understand?   Can't zzz tonight...probably a combination of that can of coke during dinner and the start of filming early tomorrow morning...I'm the lighting/ camera crew assistant for this upcoming film...It's a local flick...titled "Clouds in my Coffee"....so when it comes out be sure to catch it...even if it's just for  the sake of seeing my name in the credits....  Christmas is always the time for friends and family...sad to say..i won't be able to spend much time with them during this period because of work commitments...i'm gonna be on the film project for the next two weeks...everyday from 830 all the way til about 9 at night...on somedays the earliest I get off is about 6pm...but think about it...this is just a rough idea of what the filming schedule is like...in reality it's all delays delays delays...Here's what I have in store for the upcoming 2 wks ahead....WORK WORK WORK, OFF ON XMAS DAY, WORK til 29th...  As usual, mom is bitchin' about my work schedule and my lack of income from this project...It's a good thing my bro is on my side as well...since he understands the background of the industry since he's in Drama...  I'm asking for it...I'm not gonna bitch about it because it's what I wanna do in life...I wanna produce and direct films...I was not put in this planet to be manufactured by the Singapore eduational system to be one of their drones who are put to work behinds desks between 9-5 and beyond...  I won't be put off from it because of a little hard work...true...there's little or no film industry here in Singapore...but it's a start for me....I'll grab whatever chances I get now...be it paid or not paid...whether I've to work from dawn til dusk...  If this wasn't the Xmas period or if some friends weren't back home for the holidays, I wouldn't mind...it's just unfortunate that it had to coincide with this situation...As much as I would love to spend time with them, but sacrifices have to be made at times...I mean, how many chances do you have to follow your dreams?   It's sad that I won't be able to go party with them, not be able to send them off, and what's worst is that I probably won't be able to see them for the next year or so...since these guys make only annual trips back here to Singapore...  So to all those friends I have to ditch this festive season...my apologies...

       You can run, but you can't hide...   It's funny how these thoughts of mine are kinda inspired by the late nite chats I have online...today on the agenda - The Saddam Capture and Former Friends...  1st off...Saddam...jeez...look @ this guy...a pale shadow of his former self...was watchin the footage of him earlier...made me realise that he kinda looked liked Gizmo from Gremlins...you know the cute one that multiplies when he gets wet....i think it was the beard and the hair...  Desiree said somethin that made me from someone who wanted his blood to someone who actually takes pity on him...He had said earlier that he wouldn't be taken alive...and there he was...giving up...so much for going down in a blaze of glory....twin pistols firing @ his assailants....Forgive the graphic descriptions...I wanna be a Hollywood Director/Producer remember? So inevitably my imagination is thinkin up action sequences right now...  Think about it...the dude's lost his empire, lost his to sons, lost his harem, lost his shag pad (CNN did a story on his shag pad some months ago...very Austin Powers-esque)...he looked tired...but then again if ur living in holes in the ground..u'd be too...  So much for my thoughts of torture as punishment for Saddam...I think we'll leave that to Osama...I can just picture it now...Mealtime @ the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay....Chow time...today its pork chops...  And so onto the topic of friendship...Unknown to most of you guys...I like to play this game I invented...it's called "Lose A Friend"...you can play it too...it's very easy...just scroll through your handphone directories...and delete the numbers of people you don't wanna be associated with...  I've no qualms about losing these so-called 'friends'...They're just out there to sponge off you in the long run...Sad to say I noticed that these are mostly Singaporeans...It seems that if you're of some use to them at a certain point in time...You're they're best friend...When they don't need you...you won't hear from them in oh..lets say...YEARS....  They are in an unrelentless pursuit after you...they'll call your house, call you cell fone, track you down on friendster....  Oh yeah..here's e best...a girl who I hardly talked to back in junior college was supposedly asking around for my contact number and address...all because she wanted to invite me to her wedding...HELLO???? I hardly know you, now you want me to help pay for your wedding??  It may seem like I don't value friendships that much...but then again you don't know the people I've been with...imagine this...getting a fone call from some1 who is just an acquaintance, some1 whom you want no connection with...and they all of a sudden wanna meet up for coffee or somethin...WHAT THE HELL IS UP????? I don't know and I don't owe you a mutha-fu#kin thing...  Someone may have said "No man is an island"...but living in Singapore and seeing some of the people I've encountered here...I'm ready to take my chances....  You may wonder what the connection is between these 2 topics...well I kinda feel like Saddam in a way...  You can run, but you can't hide...

       And you ask why I don't like being in town on weekends...   I made one of my rare forays into town today...actually was just passing through...cos I was goin to my so-called 'office' in Holland Village...Then boss had to cancel the meeting cos he was already swamped with other meetings...So there I was...on a bus...nowhere to go...  Jeez...Orchard Boulevard was almost @ a standstill...well I said almost...remember we're talkin on a Singapore scale here...which can't compare to the infamous Manila n Bangkok Gridlock...it took about 30mins just to travel from Dhoby Ghaut to Orchard...which is probably about a 15minute walk...during this time i began to call for reinforcements...you know...last minute pool playing buddies...here's how it went...  Caller no. 1 Sabrina = I'm goin to Siglap, wanna meet me there?(No way am I goin back home since I was already in town)  Caller no. 2 Sky = I've got other plans man...some other time...(I'm cool though...his reason was valid enough...and for those who are wondering...Yes...I called a guy...I forgot to bring my 'chick-tionary')  Caller no. 3 Shannen = I've got a headache...(Ok...I know she needs her rest)  Caller no. 4 Gareth = no answer...(PICK UP THE FONE!!!)  Caller no. 5 Christine = no answer...(I think she has caller ID...saw my number...and just left me hanging...)  Caller no. 6 Clarisse =  I'll meet you...in one condition..we meet near my place (which is @ bukit timah)...  DING DING DING...we have a winner...  Stupid me had to open my mouth and say "Ok...C'ya @ Holland Village then"  So I had to endure another 20 mins on the bus number 7 just to get to Holland V...for what? a 'nice' meal of Char Siew Rice...Damn...I could've taken the a walk to Bedok interchange if I wanted Char Siew Rice...  But nonetheless I appreciated her company on a Saturday afternn on such short notice...it's good to know that there is still some spontaniety in this world ruled by the comment ' Lemme check my PDA...see if I can make it "  Total travel time from Bedok to Holland V? 90minutes...Jesus Christ!!!! If I was on a plane...I'd be halfway back to Manila by now....  And so I shall make this vow again...I will never go back to town on a weekend afternoon...  Well...come to think of it...I was in town last week...but I took the subway...  At the rate I'm avoiding town on wkends...I think I'll get no Xmas shopping done this year...

       So this is showbiz...   Finally got that call from J, the director for the upcoming film that I'm supposed to work as a production assistant on...  Lo n behold...he decides to give bump me up a couple of notches to the camera crew...jeez...a promotion, and I haven't even been to the set yet...he said it was due to my enthusiasm for this project...Obviously, a little positivity goes a long way...  That morning call set the tone for the whole day...imagine me walking around with that stupid grin on my face...come to think of it...was already walking around with that grin on my face for the last coupla days...  I guess it just goes to show that if you just stick to your guns and that you're willing to stick your neck out there...someone out there will be willing to give you your chance...Remember that your boss was in the very same shoes that you're in right now...  The project was acutally supposed to start this coming saturday...but of course nothin is ever certain in this industry as I've learnt...so right now the latest news is that we'd be starting on the 17th...  Hafta admit though...I'm kinda apprehensive about this...feeling as though I've bitten off more than I can chew...But fret not...I know I wouldn't be in this position had it not been for my patience, remember I've waited about 8 months to get here; as well as my perseverance, I've had so many doors 'slammed' in my face...So whatever happens...   Let's Get It On !!!

       The Great Mane...   Met up with Shirls, Jo, Adam n Aaron from my advanced diploma class earlier this evening...decided to skip dinner with them as I was already hungry from the gym session with Wes...  As usual...when you don't get to see people for a while it's inevitable that the talking point would be the most obvious thing about you...For my case...it would be "The Great Mane..."  I guess they find it weird that I'm actually growing my hair out this time round...probably 'cause they've always seen me with my head shaved...  First impressions do count the most...Some of my friends didn't like the new look...they preferred me with a whole head of hair...these guys preferred the shaved look...  Not that I care that much about what people think anyway...  This upcoming project of letting my hair grow out is probably a test to see how patient I am to getting what I want...in this case..it all started with Nyi's comment on how I might look like Sean Paul should i decide to get cornrows done...  But you never know with me...I've this habit of shaving it all off on a whim... well you know what they say,   Hair today...gone tomorrow...

       Mommy, how come that woman from China is singing our national anthem?   I'd like to send my congratulations to the SIngapore athletes there in Vietnam for the South East Asia games...Thank you for winning another gold medal that your fellow Singaporeans can be proud of...  Oh wait...did I say fellow Singaporeans? I meant fellow Chinamen can be proud of....For those who don't know what I'm getting at...let me enlighten you...Singapore has this habit of giving imports almost immediate citizenship...  Still need proof? Take a look @ these names... Li Li for the women's badminton team - China Liu Fan is another one that sounds like a China surname... If i recall correctly her name...i think it's Jing or Jiang Junhong or something...Oh fuck it...I wouldn't give a rat's ass even if it was Jimbo or Jumbo Junhong...plays table-tennis...all i know is she is a confirmed China born athlete...I can fuckin vouch for it...I saw her in a TV interview and she can't even speak a fuckin word of english...  Ok..so not all of them are from China...there's this Ronald Susilo (indonesian) in badminton...not to mention the Brazilian and Croatian imports that play for the Singapore national football team...  Let me add that for those of you who think that I'm just being racist towards Chinamen/Chinawomen...Let me remind you that I'm of chinese descent as well...anyway if you wanna call me a racist, go ahead...I'm a product of racist, elitist Singapore...brought up by the world-renowned Singapore education system production line and I'd hafta say I'm proud of it...cos it made me a better person by experiencing racism first hand...I've found it a lot easier to be friends with non-locals as compared to locals...my closest friends are from Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia...  I've been treated like a 2nd class citizen because people find out that I'm from the Philippines...apparently people think that we Filipinos are only good enough to become maids...for those of you who think that, I'd like to take my made-in-the-Philippines broom and shove the bristle end up your ass...  I'd brush off comments like these though...but what intrigues me the most is how most Chinese Singaporeans I know hate their mainland China counterparts...remember...most of these Chinese Singaporeans I know happen to be in the country's top 2 universities...namely NTU and NUS...people mock the mainland Chinese accents, are disgusted @ their habits (this I am guilty of)...well..let's just face it...It's like Singaporean Chinese think they're an echelon above the mainland Chinese...  Well local Chinese dudes...I'd hate to break this to ya....but aren't you using the language that the mainland Chinese dudes created?  I'd love to get into more serious detail here...but tell me something...Don't you just love it when you find out that most people actually hate their own kind...I don't think you can get more racist than that...

       Tis the Season for Bad Breakups....Fa la la la la, la la la la    Ah...December...the time of the year where relationships are strained and people break up...just the right time of the year to pick off the weak and vulnerable...  Was on my way home after hanging out with some junior college friends, looking forward to a cold shower followed by Ms. World and then a night of football...I got asked out for supper by Tanya...she's having bf troubles or somethin...Never one to skip on a cheap, hearty, and fatty meal of roti prata...I obliged  Why is it always the case that whenever somebody I know has a problem in their relationship, they come straight to me for advice?  Gotta tell you straight out that I'm no Dr. Ruth when it comes to relationship advice...Hell...I'm hardly the person to talk to when it comes to it...I got this uncanny knack of thinkin that I'm Mr. Right for Ms. Wrong...  The way I see it, I'm probably seen as a loser in love, so in a way its a kind of catharsis for them, seeing me would make them feel better about themselves...  Or they either see me as someone with a valuable insight on how to deal with failed relationships...you know...moving on yadda yadda yadda...  To continue the story, I got back home from supper, missed the winner of the Ms. World pageant...I think Ms. Ireland won, missed the 2 goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy, and on top of that...I got an unpleasant phone call from John...Tanya's bf...  Given my supposed reputation of being a 'playa' in some circles that I happen to run in, I noticed that I'm being used as a pawn in their little war...I don't appreciate the calls from the boyfriend of a platonic friend asking me where his girlfriend is...like how am I supposed to know?  Personal Thought :Wow!!! Me? A playa? Damn...I must be playing my cards right...Looks like my reputation preceeds me...  Sure...it's flattering for me to know that a guy feels threatened whenever I go out with his girlfriend...Honestly I don't think that highly of myself...but then again..who am I to argue with his insecure ass right? From my experiences, if you think your girl is screwing with you...then you should talk to her...not to me...  I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing...  Good - knowing that some guys find you a threat to their relationship...U know...Alpha Male ego thing...  Bad - Being used as a make-shift boyfriend to make the original boyfriend jealous...  Ugly - Finding out the low expectations I've placed on myself...I've always had the saying "I'm no Tom Cruise, so why raise the bar so high?" Please note that I've always thought that Tanya was outta my league...but after this little incident...I think I can make the step up to the next level...    To quote Mike Lowry (played by Will Smith) in Bad Boys II,   Don't hate the playa...Hate the game...

       Dick Brained   Maybe it's just the time, maybe it's cos of the conversations I had with the guys earlier, or maybe its cos of the topics I'm talkin about online now...It seems to me that thoughts @ this time all converge on 1 topic...SEX...and to a smaller extent...my personal relationships  Ever since Desiree showed me this guy's blog with a picture of a Japanese girl on it...that image has been etched into my retina...hey it's not porno or anythin...the girl was dressed...albeit, how shall we say...provocatively perhaps?  I'm not really the type who has a Japanese / Oriental look fetish...but I beg to differ @ this point in time...current crush happens to be a "Channel 8" girl...to the uninitiated, Channel 8 girls are the fair, Chinese-speaking types...  I've always liked those who are tanned and English-speaking...well Tagalog speaking would be most preferred...though I've never had any luck in that department...and I can hear those of you who are suggesting "Far East Plaza, Sundays"...  Maybe it's just a phase I'm goin thru...you know, to try somethin new for a change...I'd love to try somethin new allright...the "2 forbidden fruits"...You guys know what I mean right?  But I've to admit I think I'll be taking some time off looking for a mate this time round...don't know why...maybe I'm just tired of this...Everyone is telling me that I should find somebody and try to have a serious relationship for a change...like think of the possibility of settling down...  It's funny how some guys see their girlfriends...They think of them as an accessory to have...somethin to look good in their honda civic...Kinda pity those girls who are thought of this way...  I guess I'm not ready for a serious relationship right now...I've got a lot on my mind...Trying to chase my dreams, trying to get my Bachelors...and as you already know...I get flustered when I don't get a definite answer...and unfortunately sometimes my significant other bears the grunt of my frustrations...It's just not fair to her right?  Boy I do sound mature right now...which is kinda surprising...If you really stop to think about being in the other person's shoes...You'll kinda get the whole picture...  For the record, Rina if you're reading this, you are not a Channel 8 Girl...I know you'd hate being called that...you'll still be the exotic Java girl in my book...*wink*

       Hey I'm not that computer illiterate afterall...   Hmm...who knew? I finally managed to add a links section to my site...yeah I know it'll look better if its on the side of the page, but gimme a break ok?  It's a major accomplishment for me...Remember, back in the day when I was in the computer club back in secondary school, I just took the programs and retyped it out in the computer...whether I understood the meaning of all those codes was a different matter altogether...And if you're wondering what I was doing in the Computer Club, it was the only extra curricular activity that didn't require me to return to school on a Saturday...  As for this one...well...I understood what had to be replaced and stuff...@ least i think so...so I think I'm off to a good start...Jeez....hope I don't end up a computer nerd...  You know that call I was waiting for yesterday? Well it didn't come...and here I was about to give up hope...Des told me that I should be patient...That's the problem with me...If I want somethin, I need it right away...  It's a matter of being in control of my destiny...I really hate it when I'm left hangin...know what I mean? I always wanna know where I stand...So in the meantime I guess I'll give it a week or so...since the actual production won't be starting until the middle of the month...I sure hope they're right when they said "Good things come to those who wait..."  For the record, I've been waiting for that good thing or opportunity for the past 5 months...and according to my calculations, I still have about just under 2 years more...

       When opportunity knocks...   How many people are actually living their dream right now? How many are sitting down thinking about the "what ifs" in their life?  I don't know about you, but I'd hate to be in the latter group...  Had another opportunity to get started on the road to becoming a TV/Film Producer today....Just hope it'll work out this time...  So many times this year I've had the door close in my face just because of a single flaw in my resume - non-Chinese speaker...It seems that I'm @ a real disadvantage here...  I went for an interview today, everything went well...Had good rapport w/ the director and producer who were interviewing me...It seems that I was keen and they were keen...Heck...They even told me who I was gonna work under...but I still didn't get the confirmation on whether I got the job or not...Just hoping to get that fone call tomorrow....  Since it's an intern/production asst post, there's no pay, they'd only cover my expenses....but I'm not here for the money...I'm here to learn from the experience....to fatten up my resume...but somehow my mom and some friends don't seem to understand what I'm after here...  "U mean ur gonna work for free???" was  their remark...They dont seem to understand that there's no way you can be considered for a entertainment-industry related job if you have no contacts and/or experience...  Is money all conquering? Would I give up my dream for the sake of a paycheque @ this point in my life? I guess I'd hafta say no...  I believe it's a small price to pay to gain in the long run...afterall...I just want an opportunity to prove myself...to get that big break...I'm still young, I'm still in school, there's no expections on me in finding a decent job...   Remember...when opportunity knocks, break the door down...

       No cakes, no dinners please...It's just another day for me...   I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today...it's a monday..so gimme a break...I dont know what it is about mondays...i guess its just a day for me to sit around and not do stuff...not even going out...  Just like any other birthday, you get the frantic "i've to wish you a happy bday b4 midnite" calls as well as the multiple text messages from almost every1 in your address book wishing you a happy birthday..well...almost every1...  It's not that I dont appreciate it, but sometimes you just wanna be alone...you catch my drift? It would be rude not to answer it or reply to it...so it looks like i haven't got a choice now...  I would like to take the opportunity to apologise to those whose dinner invitations for tonight i turned down...sometimes I just need some 'alone time'...have to admit I was a tad too anti-social today...  Treated today like any other monday...for those who don't know what I'm talkin about, refer to Nov 25 entry "same shit, different day'...  No thoughts seem to be in my head tonight...but that could be due to the intoxicating aroma of the drying paint...I just painted my room door tonight...cos i tore down a poster that was on it, and the paint just came right off...  So, if you don't see any more postings here...then I'd guess you can safely assume I died @ the age of 23yrs and a day...

       I'm not old, just older...   So it now reads 23 on my rolodex...wait, 23 is a good number isn't it?...worn by Michael Jordan and David Beckham...so much for denial...  Hmm..@ the tail end of the early 20s...next thing you know it'll be the mid 20s...which considering where I am right now....is kinda depressing...  But bad choices have been made and I'm not one to ponder over the 'what ifs' in life...so just bring it on and go with the flow...  At least my week of depressing self-reflection has come to an end...this annual practice almost always turns out to be a cathartic experience...  For the second year running my birthday has been a relatively low-key affair...just dinner and a coupla drinks with friends...no more of those fancy all nighter BBQs or those routine nights at clubs...Hmm..I think the last birthday I spent @ a club was when NyiNyi and the others were still around...2001 I think...  Though I still enjoy a wild night about town...I think I'm past those days of non-stop hardcore partying...I'm happy just to be sittin down somewhere with a coupla friends chillin...  I've mellowed through the years...no more of that "I'm 18 and indestructable" attitude...Strangely enough..it's exactly that kind of mentality that brought me down...Isn't that always the case? The thing you strongly believe in is always the one that brings you down onto your knees...  I remember a stand-up routine told by Jerry Seinfeld about life...he said that life should be the other way around...You start out old and then slowly work your way back to childhood...Come to think of it, it kinda makes sense...You go through the hardships early in life (raising kids, working, mid life crises), have fun during your mid-life of 25-18 ( wild parties, anti-establishment phases), then u die worry-free as a child...to top it all off...death comes an orgasm...   When I look in the mirror, I don't hate what I see. There's a few more lines, staring back at me. The night, has grown just that lil' bit colder...

       Excess Baggage   More evidence that some people are just out to use you...woke this afternoon only to receive a message on MSN asking for a copy of my resume as a template... no greeting whatsoever...HELLO!! what ever happened to a simple "hello..how r ya man? need ur help"..I would've been more obliging...needless to say...he's the 1st entrant into this year's "block" list...   Rainy day today...Very rainy day today...so no tennis...I think I might get  Old Faithful  restrung tomorrow...   Since we're on the subject of tennis...I've a feeling it's the end of an era in tennis...my hero Agassi lost to Safin in 5 sets in another marathon 4 hour match...Despite being in great shape for a veteran on tour...I have this gut feeling that he's bowing down at the end of this season...   On a lighter note...thanks to Sky for remembering that I'm a big fan of Saturday Night Live...   http://www.jillsjokeline.com/snl.html

       My Weapon of Choice :  Old Faithful    All this live coverage of the Australian Open has stirred up the strong feelings I have for tennis to a whole new level...  I'm miss being out of the game for so long...though I'd hafta admit the days of playing on a competitive level are beyond me now because of injury...I'd hafta say my enthusiasm for the game has not waned a bit...on the contrary...i'd say that it's at the level I had back in the good ol' days...maybe even more so...  There is also a prospect of getting a new racquet to accompany my new found motivation...been looking at the Head Titanium Radical as well as the LiquidMetal Radical...which I believe is in the stellar price range of $250 and $330 respectively...that's a far cry from my Head Radical Tour...which I got for around $180 back in '97...  As much as I'd love to be wielding a new and improved version of my current tool to keep up with Sky's Babolat Pure Drive, better known as the Andy Roddick weapon of choice...I'm too nostalgic...afterall I did have some wonderful moments with the Radical Tour...playing in tournaments intra-college, inter-college, SPEX 2000...countering drop-shots with outragous cross court returns, serving big, drilling the ball down the lines...more often than not these moments were accompanied an obnoxious "WOOHOO!!!!"  And so with a heavy heart and a happier bank account, I refuse the lure of the newer, more improved model...The old racquet has served me well, literally and figuratively...I think it deserves a new string job as well as a new wrap of Tournagrip for all these years of faithful unwavering service...  So here's to  Old Faithful 's re-introduction onto the practice courts tomorrow...

       I'm goin' back to school...   After a year long sabbatical I'm glad to be finally going back to school...Finally got the module syllabus today and I hafta get my text tmr...Doin "Art and Our World" as the first module...  In a way I'm kinda sad though...doing my course long distance...I'd never be able to experience life on campus...also taking a look @ my schedules....I don't think I'll ever relate to what my friends regard as 'no life when your goin for your bachelors'...  Well I guess you can't have everything you want in life....

       Why does this always happen to me?   I don't know...It seems to dawn on me that people all around me are talking about marriage (did I get the spelling right?)...24-year-old friends are getting engaged, friends are getting married, my parents are planning their silver annievrsary, grandparents just celebrated their gold...All signs seem to be pointing to me to get serious with somebody...  Ok...I admit that I have trouble getting over my relationship with Rina...and it sure don't help when I pick up that phone and dial long distance just to catch up on things with her...Surprisingly it's only the 1st time I've done that...with her doing most of the calling...  I guess that's what happens when you're lonely...It's been almost 6 weeks since we last seen each other...and I hafta admit a lot of things happened over the holidays that I just had to tell her even though she probably read most of them here in my blog...  We had somethin great goin on...the highs were really highs, the lows were really down in the dumps...too bad it just wasn't on the cards...  Was already in bed about a half hour ago listening to Bon Jovi's Bounce album...can't get to sleep...thinkin about her...  And now I can't get this song outta my head...   Open All Night    I saw you coming from a mile away Trying to hide behind that pretty face Bet my last dollar baby you been bruised Poor little heart all black 'n' blue  Last thing you need's another pickup line You must have heard them all a thousand times God only knows what you been through Believe me I've been broken too  It aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away I've been around that block a time or two  Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth Please don't say my name, give this heart a break I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late I'll leave on the light These arms are open all night  I got your taste in the back of my mouth I want to reach in and pull it out And I'd be lying if I didn't say When you're this close I'm afraid Of the way I'll feel if I touch your hair The way I'll miss you when you're not there And that I'll see you when I close my eyes It's too late, I've crossed that line  It breaks, it aches, it takes your breath away I'll still be around come closing time  Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you I try, try, try but I can only tell the truth Please don't say my name, give this heart a break I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late I'll leave on the light These arms are open all night  It's 2 am, it's last call, baby. The barkeep's gone, I'll walk you home now Save me, baby  Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you I try, try, try but I can only tell the truth Please don't make me beg, give this heart a break I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late I'll leave on the light These arms are open all night    I know what I'm getting at...But I'm too afraid to admit it...

       Asian Pride   Woke up only to find that I already missed the 1st set of the Paradorn Srichaphan vs Andre Agassi tennis match...  Talk about divided allegiances...On one hand I'm a big Agassi fan...Wore his sneakers, use his gear...tried to play like him...operative word.."tried"  On the other hand...you have Asia's pride in the tennis world...The thai Srichaphan...It was nice seeing someone of my skin color mixing it up with the big boys of tennis...  Throughout my life...I've had western sports heroes...Agassi, Sampras, Jordan, Baggio...  For once...it sure feels good to be rooting for an Asian...  Surprisingly though...If Srichaphan happened to be from  Singapore...I wouldn't be caught dead cheering him on...I think it's because Singaporean athletes are an arrogant bunch...Nothin feels better than watching Singapore sportsmen believe their own hype...only to watch them wallow in bitter defeat...  Remember Team Singapore...you are not Goldberg...SO DON"T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!   For the record, Agassi won in straight sets...7-6, 6-3, 6-4

       I wanna do this for a living...   I think I should go and find a mate who believes in Noah's Ark...It's been raining for about 2 days non-stop now...well almost 2 days since I believe it started on Friday afternoon...What was it? Continuous rain for 40days and 40 nights right?   Warning : If you have not seen  The Last Samurai , please do not continue reading...possible spoilers enclosed.  Caught  The Last Samurai  today...damn...another great film in the mould of  Gladiator  or  Braveheart ...  It's amazing how much I've learnt during those 3 weeks working with the production crew...seems that I've adopted an appreciation for all the slight nuances that seem to be present in the many different scenes of a movie...  I've come to understand the symbiotic relationship between the soundtrack and the various scenes...None more so than the scenes preceeding the climactic battle...The use of drum beats tied in with the quick cuts of the different various elements of the battle definitely heightened up the tension in the scene...It's hard trying to put it into words...  I loved the ending scene when Katumoto committed Harikiri...Taking into account the way his character is developed throughout the movie...the scene of him looking at the falling cherry blossoms before his death brings closure to his character...  Jeez...look at me...talkin like I know lotsa shit...I think I'm gonna enjoy doing this for a living...film-making I mean...

       Being 1/8 Chinese doesn't mean I hafta celebrate CNY...   I guess the headline says it all...  I'm not being racist or anything...having a Chinese middle name does not automatically make me someone who celebrates Chinese New Year...  As I've told Desiree, celebrating festivals here in Singapore will not make up for the memories I do not have of celebrating Christmas and New Year (Jan 1) back home...  So forgive me if I'm not enthusiatic about your Yu-Shengs and Hong Baos...   I'm just proud to be Pinoy...

       Boys will always be boys...   This thought has always crossed my mind but I'm not stupid enough to attempt it...  Was watching this documentary on National Geographic tonight... Built For The Kill  ...it's about how animals are adapted to hunt...the coolest bit about that show is the voice over talent says "...that the Lion/Tiger/Cuttlefish/whatever animal is Built For The Kill"  To cut a long story short...My trademark stupid grin lit up my face...took a quick glance 2 my bro's pet turtle...wondered..."Is my brother's turtle...Built for the kill?" *Note- emphasis on last line  I grew up more or less old school...catching spiders, watching the fighting fish...So now I'm wondering...since the turtle is an omnivore...Would it tear apart a guppy?  Just a thought that's all...not like I'm really gonna do it...just the inner child in me rearing his cute head...  Would be cool though...just to find out if it's really built for the kill.....  Cue :  Sinister Laughter

       Not another one of my conspiracy theories...   I've kept it in for quite a while now...talked to a lot of people about it...but I think I've got to let it all out into the open...  Can someone please tell me if they have seen any Malay bus drivers? It just occured to me a month or so ago when I was taking bus 14...there's Chinese and Indian drivers on bus 14....but havent seen any Malays though...  Just a thought though...cos was having a little racist debate earlier on tonite...somethin about equality of the races here in singapore...  I know that the bus driver observation is a little way off...but it does make you think though....

       I want some Mo!! I want some Mo!!   Went to the gym with Clarisse this evening...made me postpone my usual afternoon session just because she needed someone who had the right motivation to work out with her...  I guess it was worth it...it's been a long time since I last punished my body this way...started off with weight training...no leg work today...upper body...Had the usual 3.5km run AFTER weights...which was a surprising change since I always use the run to work up a sweat...  Since I couldn't shut up about training to get back into tennis-playing mode, she decided to push me up to the next level...sprint training...which...in my current state...isn't exactly child's play...who am I kidding...I fear sprint training now...I don't think the titanium implants in my hips are made for explosive running...but hey..it was an ego thing...as macho as it may have seemed several hours ago...I think it's kinda stupid...lookin back...My orthopaedic surgeon won't be pleased...  Damn...it felt good doin those sprints within the confines of the tennis court...brought back memories of the good ol days back with the SRJC tennis team...  And so I go into another one of my self-destructive streaks...only this time it's physical and not mental...remember...what don't kill you...will make you stronger...as I so bluntly tell myself during workouts    Pain is your friend...I want some Mo!!! Gimme some Mo!!!

       Life is just one Anthropological experiment after another...   It's funny how first impressions count so much on human behavior...went with Jimmy to this sports shop @ Parkway Parade today...went straight in towards the tennis gear section...right away I noticed that we were being eye-balled by some of the staff...Probably because of how I dressed...not shaved, baseball cap, bermudas...not typical tennis player look...I went and started asking that particular staff member some questions regarding the tennis rackets that were on display...he was dumbfounded and had to get a more senior staff member to address my queries...  Anyway I asked about the Head Titanium Radical (Andre Agassi's racket) and the Babolat Pure Drive (Sky's new baby)...immediately their view towards us changed...I guess that's probably because I'm enquiring about high end models and judging from the questions I was asking...he knew that I meant big business...in fact, he was willing to bring out the Radical (which was being kept in the back, kept in the back? for what? security reasons?Jeez..its a tennis racket...not a diamond necklace) as well as telling me that if I ordered a Pro Drive, I'll get it by next week...  When we came back to the shop after some browsing around the mall...and surprisingly..we were greeted with a smile...how nice...they remembered us...enough said...either way...I still became a customer @ that shop..bought some tennis balls and an overgrip...  I decided to conduct another 'experiment'...this time with the cashier @ Pasta Mania...I ordered with a smile...Well I hafta say the service we received was pretty good...with a smile and not a frown might I add...To be honest...I'm pretty shallow...I used to only smile @ cute and attractive cashiers...but I guess I hafta admit that being a more sociable person would make the other party more sociable as well...  Sigh...and a lot of people out there complain about bad service...   C'est La Vie

       A little positivity goes a long way...   Thanks to about an hour's worth of self-deliberation in my dark quiet room...I've realised that I've brought this self-doubt upon myself...  It's amazing what a little time alone can do for you...I mean really being alone...no music...no phone calls...no distractions...just me...my bed...and a very dark room...   Behind Blue Eyes    No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes  No one knows what it's like To be hated To be fated To telling only lies   But my dreams They aren't as empty As my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free   No one knows what it's like To feel these feelings Like I do And I blame you   No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain and woe Can show through   But my dreams They aren't as empty As my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free   When my fist clenches, crack it open Before I use it and lose my cool When I smile, tell me some bad news Before I laugh and act like a fool   If I swallow anything evil Put your finger down my throat If I shiver, please give me a blanket Keep me warm, let me wear your coat   No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes

       What goes up, must come down...   A lot of my friends seem to notice my 'down-in-the-dumps' mood over the past week or so...wondering how come I could go from someone with a totally positive outlook on the upcoming year ahead to becoming someone who is worried about survival in the upcoming decades ahead...  I've tried talkin to a friend about these feelings...but she just didn't seen to understand...but then again...I could have just been talkin to the wrong person...lemme rephrase that...I WAS talkin to the wrong person... It's hard talking to the wrong person, I know that she means well with the suggestions she gives...but it just don't make sense when she doesn't really understand the big picture...  I feel lost...haven't had this feeling in a long long time...It's not that I've lost my direction in life or somethin...I know where I'm heading, I know what I gotta do to get there, it's just that there's no way to head in that direction now...in a word...I feel helpless...kinda like how it felt lying on a hospital bed for weeks right after my first hip injury...  I always have a knack of finding the right situations to bring me down...went to check out the website of the job ads for the film and tv industry...guess what...there are hundreds of job openings in the past month for 'freshies' like me in New York and Los Angeles alone...while there are 5..yes only 5 openings available here in Singapore...  I think I finally know what my problem is...  I am IN Singapore...

       9pm end time? As if!!!   And so back to work I go again...if you can call what I do is work...we were given a scheduled time of 3pm -9pm...yeah right...like people really adhere to the scheduled time in film production...  It ended @ about 130 in the morning...so much for going to Phuture and hanging out...good thing I didn't make any plans for tonite...  And so another chance @ asking that girl out is thrown away...just wasn't in the mood...  Don't ask me why...I just haven't been my usual self these days...spent the early hours of Saturday morning by the pool downing a couple of bottles of Corona...Therapeutic...but not really recommended by healthcare providers...  Ever had those periods of time where you have somethin to say and nobody to say it to? I think I'm at one of those times now...Jeez I miss being being in a relationship...having someone to talk to during these times...  Can't wait for school to start...distract me from these problems...if you can call them that...

       Swing Batta Batta Swing   Just when you thought it's all good with your life...Life sends another curveball coming your way...  I had my plans for the year all laid out nicely...you know..juggling my studies together with lookin for internships in the film-making and/or journalism industry...just to fatten up my resume in the hope of easing the passage of breaking into the industry...  But unfortunately life isn't as smooth sailing as it seems...Don't know what brought about this sense urgency...but somehow I think I might hafta forgo experience for the sake of a decent paycheck...Been weighing up the pros and cons and I realise that one needs $$ to survive...  On one hand...If i forgo internships now, and find a decent paycheck...I'll graduate with nary a thing on my resume...but with cash in hand to move out of this goddamn country...   On the other...go for the internships...no money...in fact I'll probably hafta dip into my savings account...but in the long run have experience...which would benefit me if I wanna stay here...but fact is I would have no money to facilitate my moving outta here...I don't think I'd wanna be lookin towards my parents' for $$ to get out of here...When I get out of here I wanna do it on my own....  It's not yet the top of the 9th with the scores tied...But I guess I'd hafta rack up some runs on the board to make World Series don't you think?

       The Definition of Irony...   The definition of irony = My celebrating the visual rewards of my months of gym training by treating myself to a fattening meal of Chicken Mutarbak...  Well the quarterly checkup went well today...finally off the expensive medication ($7 a pill?????)...for 3mths @ least...cos results from my medical tests came out normal...@ least tt's good news...  Here's the bad news...my PS2 is officially dead...so since the warranty is void...I might as well open it up myself...see what I can do right?  Strangely enough, all the things that sorta happened to me today has made me thought about the things that make people happy...  Seems that I see happiness in a quantity-esque sorta way...lookin @ what I've been bitchin about...a dead PS2, a bad date, being single during the holidays...  What brought about this sudden reflection into the realm of 'happiness'?Hafta say it was people watching...  1. Hospital waiting room - Some kid who appeared quite ill was going around saying 'Hi' to strangers...thought it was weird...like wat is some kid going around sayin 'Hi' to strangers...but he had an infectious smile on his face...  2. Hospital waiting room - Busy nurse who was approached by the above mentioned kid...same effect...smile...but this time accompanied by a small wave...  3. Bus stop - Old lady chasing bus 196 while it was about to leave...driver stops to wait...probably about a minute @ most...old lady walkin slowly towards bus...with big smile on her face...  All these may seem like small things...but I notice that these are the small things that we in the rat race often overlook...I'd hafta admit...my slanted view towards 'happiness' is sorta...oh who am I kidding? my view towards 'happiness' is downright shallow...  Hence the indulgence on Mutarbak with several of my friends tonight...hey don't look @ me that way...I've a high metabolic rate...I'll burn it all off tomorrow...

       Frustration sets in...   I don't know whether if I just have too much time on my hands, or whether I'm just suffering from withdrawal symptoms of not having to go for filming...But I still can't seem to get back into my normal useless bum lifestyle...oh wait..my usual bum lifestyle revolves around my PS2..which unfortunately is out of order...Tried to get it fixed today...but seemed like the guy was tryin to say it wasn't in workin order no more...want me to cough up $350 for a new set...I'd say I can't live without the PS2...but I'd give it another shot @ another shop, if all else fails try to do some self-repair...before we take the giant leap into purchasing a new set...  I also notice that I'm getting frustrated tonight because I've a routine checkup @ the hospital later this afternoon...Nothin serious though...just the usual round of blood and urine tests just to get the prescription of the drugs that are keeping me alive and well...  I should be used to it by now...but somehow the more I get used to being in and out of hospitals...the more i get sick of it...But then again...doesn't every1 get sick of hospitals...I shouldn't be complaining...afterall I'm better off now as compared to way back then...I've come a long way...having had to go to the cancer center for treatment almost every month some years back...having had to go there for physiotherapy ever so often after my injury...look @ me now...back in pretty good shape...  I guess I've a lot to be thankful for...unfortunately it seems that it might take sometime for me to forget the past experiences in hospital...especially when I'm expected back there every few months or so...

       A guy's take on guy talk...   Had a guys' night out earlier today...the usual...dinner, a coupla beers together with obligatory soccer game at one of the pubs at mohd sultan...For the record, Manchester Utd beat Aston Villa 2-1 with both goals coming from Paul Scholes...Over the past few wks I've been spending a whole lot of time there...both @ work and @ play...in fact even more so than the whole of 2002 i think...But enuff about that...  I don't know how it is when girls get together...but I always get that  Deja Vu  feeling whenever I meet up with the guys...We always seem to talk about the holy trinity( girls, cars, football)  There is the omni-present line being asked by a single guy to a friend..."You got anyone to intro?"...which translates to "I'm desparate...do you have anyone who's as desparate as me whom you can hook me up with?"  What the hell is up with that line? Is that some kind of male greeting? Cos I always seem to get that...Remember I'm single...So before I go out introducing any of my single female friends to these single guys...I'd like to make sure that I handle my priorities first...  Sometimes I'd just love to say this "HELLO!!!! I'm not attached...let me settle my love life first before I help you out with yours..."  It's really a sad case...a bunch of single guys hanging out..You know when you go to a seafood restaurant with all the fish in the tank...where you pick out the one you'd like to be fried and put on your table? Well I feel it's kinda like that....  We're hanging out...lookin @ the ladies that pass us by...wondering when it'll be our turn...but in a different sense...cos when either of us get hitched...then it's goodbye to that guy....it's unlikely we'd ever get to see him again...weekends will be taken up by the woman...ergo...kinda like the fish...he won't be seen again...

       That'll be the last blind date I'll ever go on...   I brought this upon myself...spent most of the NYE party bitching about being single this past holiday season that my friends decided to hook me up with someone just to shut me up...  Well to be honest...she was a looker...unfortunately for me...she wasn't my type...a wee bit too classy for me...lucky for me it was a double date...or else I would have no idea on how to weasel my way out of tonight's date...  Had dinner @ this fancy italian restaurant along mohd sultan...had wine...date talk = film...the artsy artsy stanley kubrick stuff... stuff which i don't like  Apparently she had done her homework,asking me about my aspirations of being a film maker....which to be honest...was quite flattering...but then i got the impression that she was trying too hard...  As most of you know..I'm a simple guy...no wine, no fancy dinners, just be urself...lack of makeup would be good too...cos let's face it...if we do go steady I'm gonna be seein u with no makeup on...to be honest i hate dressing up on dates as well...just gimme a pair of jeans n Tshirt and I'm gd 2 go...  I would've preferred my first date of the new year to be with someone whom I really liked...preferably not some blind date...but what can i do? Afterall...i'm never 1 who says no to a girl...even though I'm usually on the losing end of things....sigh...I think what most people say is right...I'm always gonna be on some1's leash...damn..i think it's time to change that...  As is always the case...I get the usual reviews just because I'm sporting a new, ok..so it's not so new...but rather a more modified look...sporting no hair, with goatee...the look which i like to designate as the new "bad ass" look...I always get bad reviews either way...with hair or no hair...but I think I've struck gold with the "bad ass" combo...lotsa good reviews over it...coming from males, females, homosexuals as well as heterosexuals...  For those of you who haven't seen my bad ass look..it's on my MSN and Friendster account...  On a different note...I think i've finally found a new years resolution for me...to be nicer to the people around me...i tried it the other day...helped out this old man @ the gym...he didn't know how to use the equipment...i'm trying to adopt the "pay it forward" method...u know..do a good deed, do 3 other good deed thing...  Don't ask me why...i think it's cos i just finished watching "The Negotiator" last week....and somehow Kevin Spacey made an impact on me...once again...how I could jump from "The Negotiator" to "Pay it Forward" beats the hell outta me...So don't ask...

       With the champagne gone flat and hangover gone...   Now that the festivities end and I more or less have a clear head to think...I'd hafta say that 2003 is a vintage year for me in my 23 years on this earth...  It wasn't smooth sailing all the way though, lost friends, lost in the game of love,  had another operation on the injury, had my dreams laughed at not only by potential employers and 'friends'..but hey I can't complain though...In the face of all the pitfalls I've encountered, I've developed a determination to prove to a lot of doubters wrong after all I've been through...  Most importantly, I've rediscovered that sense of self-belief that I've lost a long time ago after being diagnosed with SLE and battling with depression...  I've proven to myself that I can achieve what I set out to do...whether it's proving doctors wrong after being told that I won't be able to run again, or proving to so-called friends that a 'nobody' like me can actually get a foot through the door of the film industry...  I've learnt a lot during this past year...most importantly, lose the excess baggage... like 1. Friends who consider you as a 'friend', 2. people who don't believe in your ability, 3. people who laugh in the face of your dreams.  I now know who my real friends and 'so-called' are...So if you have any qualms about what I have to say...feel free to say it in my face you dumb muthafucka...Just remember..your words and actions won't kill me...it'll only make me stronger...  All this adversity has changed me...Come to think of it, all the stuff that has happened to me all my life has brought me where I am today and it will still continue to exert forces on what I do in the days that are yet to come...  Everyone has their ups and downs...I'm just glad that the real highs of the year came right at the end of it...I don't know if this is the start of something good for the upcoming year, but lookin at the fallout from the end of 2003, 2004 has all the promises of a helluva good year for me...  So to all those who've had an influence in my decisions over the past year...   Thanks for being there...

       All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go...   The guilt trip I've been waiting for has finally arrived...The harsh reality of 2 papers due together with an exam in three weeks has hit me...hard...harder than the shots of tequila I had @ the BBQ I was at this evening...  I think the last couple of days of staying up late and wasting precious time has done me in...I'm gonna start on my papers later on today...  I am SO lusting after this malay girl I met @ tonite's BBQ...HEY! @ least I'm being honest here...I don't think that she'll be reading this so I can be my honest self...As Rudi would say "SEDAP!!!"  Don't mind me...that's just the tequila talking...

       Feeling This...Blink 182    (Get ready for action!) I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this) The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this) Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this) I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this) Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this) Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this) Fucking is such a blur (I'm feeling this) I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)  [Chorus:] Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I'll leave when I wanna  Where do we go from here Turn all the lights down now Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this) Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this) Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this) We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this) Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)  Chorus x2  This place was never the same again After you came and went How can you say you meant anything different To anyone standing alone  On the street with a cigarette On the first night we met  Look to the past And remember her smile And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile I'm not in the seat I think I'm fallin' asleep But then all that it means is  I'll always be dreaming of you  Chorus x5    Fate fell short this time, your smile fades in the summer... Place your hand in mine, I'll leave when I wanna...  How true...

       This mouth was made for eating, and this is what it'll do...   I just woke up from a 2 hour power nap...I'm hungry...again...  As much as I would love to gain some weight to beef up my relatively small frame...I can't seem to be able to due to my high metabolism...hmmm...maybe if i stopped goin to the gym altogether and started a new sedentary lifestyle...On 2nd thought, I'd better not...I'd probably go crazy reliving the good ol' days when I was a couch potato...  Cue, Homer Simpson :  Mmmmm...Potatoes... (Drool)  And so to the fridge I shall raid...I know what's in there...no surprises...probably gonna fire up the microwave and nuke some  char siew paos  or somethin...  I should be eating healthy...well I do that...but let's face it...surely there's some quota over how much fruits you can take in a single day right?

       Tired, tired eyes...   I'm tired...my eyes are very tired...they wanna close...but I'm keeping 'em open because Real Madrid takes on Bayern Munich away in about an hour...  I'm done with the Art module...only have a month left for the finals for that...actually kinda felt that tutorials was a waste of time...Jailani, the tutorial lecturer, asked us if we wanted to watch some oldie movies, in other words BORING!!!... A Streetcar Named Desire ,  The Piano , and some other movie I couldn't be bothered to remember what...I already have my hands full with the  Oklahoma!  musical...  And so what turned out to be a 3 hour tutorial session lasted only 45 minutes for me as the usual gang left to grab a bite to eat...  With no more school for the next month @ least...I can finally get some well deserved rest...who am I kidding..everyday is a rest day for me...  Still contemplating as to whether I should join Sky to check out Asian Aerospace this Sat...but he seems to be losing interest, and I'm more interested in keeping my expense account away from the red...So I guess I'll be skipping it again this time round...cos frankly...21 bucks to see aircraft is a wee bitter pill to swallow right?

       Judge not lest ye be judged yourself...   Went out to have dinner with some friends, together with an uninvited guest whom I shall bestow upon the hallowed name of " O Holy One'  Dinner was surprisingly a highly-opinionated affair...with discussion ranging from the mundane (daily grind) to the confrontational (sex and religion)...  O Holy One...as I've christened him...started the whole issue when he mentioned that virgin article in today's edition of the Sunday Times...obviously he felt that most of us who, as he conveniently puts it, "Fucks around" are an immoral bunch...I think it would've been a whole lot easier for him to just brand us 'fuckers'...  We of course took offence to this as we hardly knew this guy...he just tagged along with one of our friends for dinner...and here he was judging us by our open attitudes towards sex?   He obviously seems damn proud of the fact that he is saving himself for marriage...Dude...if you can't get laid..then fuckin admit it...  So off he went...sprouting some stuff about how sex should be between husband and wife after the solemn confirmation of their wedding vows...or some shit like that...there was a lot of religious stuff involved...he soon ended up preaching to us about religion and how God will forgive us if we went to confess our sins and what not...I HATE THIS KINDA PEOPLE...  As much as I would've loved to wind this fella up even more...like getting his views towards oral sex, pornography, orgies and the like...god damn...on hindsight...why didn't I do that?   As he realised that he wasn't welcome at our table anymore, he decided to make a hasty retreat...I thought I had the line of the night when I said to him,   Fuck you and your beliefs, and I mean that literally...   Christine stole my thunder though...   I wonder how he'd feel if I shoved my dildo up his ass in holy matrimony?   You go girl!!!

       Guilt sets in, with frustration not far behind...   After a night out in the town with Robbie and gang...I start to feel guilty after the realisation that I've to show somethin about the criticism of the musical  Oklahoma  to Mr. Jailani...  And so I dedicate the time I have now to an incessant symphony of the keyboard's  click-clack ...I've to come up with 2 pages worth of bullshit...which...in my current state of mind right now...should be relatively easy...I'm a bit loaded up on booze you see...  Unfortunately...I'm very particular about the quality of work I churn out because it has to have my official  Stamp of Approval ...needless to say...I'm pretty sure my work tonight don't merit that...  As much as I'd love to log off and catch some shuteye...I can't...

       To Secure Peace is to Prepare for War   For the 1st time in my life...I'm impressed by the Singapore Armed Forces...There was an AH-64D Apache Longbow attack chopper flying around East Coast Park this evening...  I don't know what it was...maybe it's cos it's only the 2nd Apache I've seen flying in the flesh...or maybe it's cos of the knowledge that the Israelis use it to destroy stuff...  I've always been a war-monger...I've seen Super Cobras in action during a training exercise in Taiwan...firing Hydra 70 Rockets at static targets...hot damn!!!  Seeing the Army operating the Apache...wow...they might actually kick ass should the need arise...  Talk about shock and awe...

       Self destructive behavior...   I don't know what it is with me...but it seems that the things that make me happy are also the things that pose the greatest threat to my body...  Had my weekly tennis game @ NTU today...time to test out the Titanium Radical...did pretty well...though i think i might need to tweak the strings to get real comfy with it...  Anyways towards the end of our supposed 2n 1/2 hour session...my right hip kinda hurt...couldn't really add full weight to it...it's still not that bad yet...but still...a lingering fear over a supposed 'upgrade' on the implant looms in the distance...  Turns out that the pain is only during my exercise or tennis sessions...cos when I got back home it was gone...  On the long subway ride home, finally decided to turn down my shortlisted application for an internship with IS magazine...i think some things are just more important than others...and the realisation of me putting my education in potential jeopardy just isn't worth it...

It only seems to complicate my life though...I've always been technologically-challenged...and now it seems that fones have become more and more complicated...Feelin like such a dumbass...  All I want is a fancy ringtone by 50 Cent or Snoop Dogg....  Is that too much to ask???

       Show me the money!!!   After much deliberation, I've finally come to the conclusion that I'm sorta having a very bad finanical year...In the past 3 months alone, I've spent way more than a thousand bucks on myself alone...The digital camera, the tennis racquet and shoes, the gym bag...  To make matters worse...that's not the end of the wishlist...cravings of another ps2, an I-mac and a digital video camera to kickstart a film career...these things will put me in dire financial straits...  It's time to get off my ass and get a job...

       Impulse buy? I think not...   After weeks of searching high and low for it, I finally chanced upon the Head Titanium Radical...needless to say...went down and bought it straightaway...  Hung out at Starbucks after class...just didn't have the mood to go home...on the agenda - sex, wrestling, people, valentine's day....how these topics got inter-twined in our conversations...I'll never know...

       Pack your bags, we're goin on a guilt trip...

The Hi-fi system is pumping 2pac and Snoop Dogg in the background, a bottle of Corona riding shotgun on my computer table, and now I'm thinkin of dropping by EZ Video to grab a couple of DVDs...  Come to think about it...my body's aching from 3 straight workout days...I think I'll just crash...  Wait a minute, don't I have an exam coming up in about five weeks? Ah screw it...I'll feel guilty sooner or later...

       Friendship Day?   Feb 14, 2004...7am in the morning...text message on my fone "Happy Friendship Day for all singles out there"  What the fuck is Friendship day? Are people so pathetic about being single that they hafta give Valentines Day another name so that they may not be so sorry about themselves....Happy Friendship Day my ass...Only in Singapore will you have some poor sap who will start such a thing so that they won't feel bad......  The rose peddlers were in full bloom out in town today...charging like 15 bucks for a single stalk...WTF???   Ended up eating with the 'singles'... 2 gals and a guy who have just re-introduced themselves to the wild world of singlehood...a booze and bitch session if u will...why we didn't hook up...a little 2 on 2 session perhaps...I have no idea...  Hearing all the stories that were being thrown out into the open..it made me realise that it's great spending this day un-attached...Memories of past valentines where girlfriends nag about me not getting flowers and shit...I don't need flowers to tell you that I love you...on the female side of the spectrum, they say that their boyfriends don't appreciate the small soft toys they made or stuff like that...It's funny to hear how couples break up ...all the small reasons that are blown way outta proportion...  Being the shallow bastards that we are...We took the opportunity to look @ couples out in full force on this day...Of course there were lotsa hotties out there...but of course there's always the other end of the spectrum...It made us all say this line...   Thank God we're not so desparate to the point where we hafta settle for a girlfriend/boyfriend who looks like that   If you take offense to our comments regarding the ugly people...Then I guarantee that you're one of the ugly people...  And if you think my friends and I think too highly of ourselves...you're wrong...  We already hold ourselves in high regard...

       Singapore is a Tossed Salad   Warning : The following post may offend the fanatically religious among you...  I nearly died in class today...it was so boring...learning about dances like ballet and traditional ones; then being introduced to the different aspects of arcitecture...ZZZ  I'm gonna get a lot of flak from Christians, or more specifically Catholics, who read this posting...I actually changed the lyrics of the hymn  Fill My Cup  while in class...here it goes...   Slit my throat Lord, Just make it fast Lord Come and end This burning of my soul God of Heaven kill me So I'd have no more Slit my throat Slit my throat And let me go...   NEWSFLASH!! This just in : I'm goin to hell....  Somehow I woke up when my professor mentioned about Singapore being a "Tossed Salad"...I had to stop myself from laughing out hysterically...inevitably I ended up having my trademark stupid grin on my face...  For those of you who don't know what "tossing salad" meant....drop me a mail...I'll let you know...

       Cute, Suave, Cool, Klutz...   I logged online and the first pop-up ad that came to me read "This valentines, give that special someone in your life what they really want..."  What I really want? A threesome...you, me, and your hottie friend...  I don't think any of the girlfriends I've had through the years would oblige to that though...so I guess you could say that I haven't gotten what I really want on valentines day...  I nearly asked someone out for Valentines...cos I've heard from Clarisse that her friend found me cute...cmon, who wouldnt find me cute?  So there we were, all in the gym...me workin out on the treadmill and then hitting the weights...could tell she was scoping me out...then I did the best thing that I've done all day...  I walked straight into the glass door of the gym...  Needless to say...I don't think I'm that cool in her eyes no more...  Ergo...no date on Valentines' day...unless she has a short term memory...

       It's only a matter of pride...   It took a while to get started, but I'd hafta say I'm more or less getting back into the swing of things...Decided to sacrifice my beauty rest in exchange for a little work time late into the night...it's about 2am Singapore time...well to be honest...I've got a hidden agenda for this...I'm waiting to catch That 70s Show later on @ 230...that will end at about 3...and I hafta wake up at about 645...do the math people...that's ok...I'll get my beauty rest tomorrow...  I'm amazed @ how much effort I'm putting into the projects that I have in front of me right now...Maybe it's cos of my "Lighten the Load" theory...I'd do a whole lot more up front, score big, which in the long run, would reduce the stress as well as anxiety levels for the finals...  I'd hafta say that I'm having fun right now...though some people might think that I'm a wee bit too enthusiastic about what I'm learning...the thing is...I like to push myself, whether physically or mentally or artistically...that's why I surpass the project requirements to suit my needs...it happened with the Electronic Media project video, now it's happening with my Egyptian Art Pyramid/Collage...it looks pretty damn cool....I'm choosing between a small pyramid or a larger one, I've done both, and the base for the whole thing is a cut-out of Egypt...  I take pride in my work, and if you can't keep up with my pace...then don't...This is my world...I'm not competing with you...I'm going for my Bachelors...this isn't grade school no more...this is the big leagues...

       These people will be with me for the next 2 years...   The realization of it just hit me today...the group of peeps that I'm with today would be the same people I'll be taking my BA's with in the coming years ahead...  That very thought haunted me through the entire bus ride home after finishing our project @ John's house...Somehow it wasn't supposed to be like this...I always pictured myself hanging out with the people I grew up during my college years...being roomies with my buddies...gettin drunk, gettin bummed out when the finals came around...I guess things always don't turn out the way you planned them to...  I kinda envy those friends who are living together in San Francisco and New York right now...they actually made it...studying and hanging out together...If not for some unforseen circumstances I could've been with them...but hey..these are the cards I've been dealt with...I'll keep my game face on and play em...  Truth be told that trust has always been the most important factor in how I make and keep friends...Anyone who doesn't make the cut don't deserve my time and energy...just ask those dumbasses from 982s3 back in junior college (Yes Desiree, you can forward my blog address to them so that they know how I feel about them)...I think I've just been stabbed in the back one too many times...Speakin of getting stabbed in the back...it's funny how I ended up in the media field...where superficiality is the name of the game...  My friends have always played an important part in my life...I know that they'd be there for me, and me for them...It's only sad that none of them are with me on this road to graduation....   Que Sera Sera

       Is it really that far to go from East to West and back again?   A trip to the Singapore Art Museum...sad to say most of us were just going thru the motions of walkin from one painting or sculpture to another...what can I say..I'm just not one for high society...  Played tennis with Sky n Shannen @ NTU yesterday...They can't believe that I would be willing to travel cross-country (Bedok to Boon Lay) for just a game of tennis...  The rain kept playing around with my feelings...when we arrived @ Sky's dorm...the heavens opened up and closed about 45minutes later...when we went to the courts, the heavens opened up again only to become bright and sunny minutes later...  Play went well...finally got my semi-western forehand back...imparting lotsa topspin causing a loopy trajectory which falls around the baseline, give or take a feet or two...my backhand still leaves a lot to be desired though...can't decide between going back the the double or single handed ones...It sure felt good...it was like those days in junior college again...but somehow my maturity or rather my injury caused a lot more patient play...with rallies being sustained for a longer period of time...  Sad to say, I may hafta finally admit that the days of competitive tennis are behind me...I don't know if it's the wet courts or my fear of my injury or even both...But my mobility sucks...The days of chasing after balls like a pit bull are long and gone...  Oh...to be 17 and indestructable again...  Well gotta bail...hafta meet John n Ed...make some sorta sculpture for art class or somethin...

       Out of the Frying Pan and into the Fire   Talk about being taken out of your comfort zone...1st module for my BA course  Art and Our World ...  All kinds of artistic terms are being thrown at me left and right...Had to choose 3 topics...luckily for me I got  Rock n' Roll, Egyptian Art, and Surrealism ...What the hell is  Surrealism ??   Finally went back to the pool this evening amid the wolf-whistles of Clarisse & Co...I think it's cos they havent seen me in Speedos for a while...hafta say it was quite flattering though...cos all the leg work I've been doing for physiotherapy had not come to naught...  It's kind of a trade-off doing my BA like this...My friends on campus complain that they've no social life...I'm complainin' that I ain't experiencing campus life...But yet I can spend evenings hanging out in the gym or by the pool...  Anyways I think I hafta get back to my work...Now what the hell does  Surrealism  mean???

       Back to School   Well it's back to school for me...talk about being in a small class...only 9 people in it...while the batch Pascale is in has like 17 or so...On the surface it don't seem like they are the sociable types...but then again it's only the first day...Being in a small group is good though...makes for easier class participation...  On a more 'fun' note...finally got my new tennis shoes...well they're not exactly new...old model...but new nonetheless right? Finally goin to play on Thurs...which according the the weatherman, should have a bit of sunshine...  Shaved my head again...Discoloration on my scalp because of the peeling scalp when i suffered sunburn when we were filming on the rooftop of Suntec city...sunburn = peeling scalp = gross...  But i look good though...(Buay Paiseh!!!)...esp with the goatee and the shaved head.... if you can look past the sunburn...

       More Comic Relief   The usual suspects (Me, edwin, leland, valerie, donnar, and cassandra) found themselves laughing once again at 'Steven Seagal'...  Much like elementary school kids...we were passing notes around just to get our messages across...helped lighten the mood of the class though...  He was staring in our direction...we didn't know whether he was scoping some of the gals out...or whether he was staring because he knew we were talking abt him...but eitherway...it helps to bring stupid grins on our faces...  Lemme give you a quick profile of 'Seagal'....long hair...tied in ponytail ala the great Aikido movie star...studded leather jacket which he wore on day 1...a lil fringe which he flicks up ever so often...Get the picture?  To make our days more lively...we finally found ourselves our very own William Hung...I'm sure he'll be the butt of many jokes...but not so much so that he'll overtake 'Steven Seagal' in the popularity stakes....

       Psyc 101   I'm back to studying Psychology now...brings me back to the days back in CAE...sitting with Ash at the back of the class looking at Liane...the class hottie...  Good God...I've come a long way since those days...OK..so maybe not...There weren't any notable hotties in class anyway...though Leland pointed out that our class had 'Steven Seagal' in it...comic relief...  Did my readings for Day 1...knew where to find the answers in the open book quiz Dr. Olson gave us...And compared to the previous Art module...I could actually understand what was going on in class...Hey I don't feel so stupid no more...  Just finished the readings for Day 2...all 30 plus pages of it...pretty much what I learnt back in junior college...since I was in the pre-med course...you know...dendrons, neurons, axons, cerebrum, cerebellum...isn't she the Mayor's assistant in Powerpuff Girls? Ms. Sarah Bellum?  It's funny how some of the things from the past come back to haunt you...somehow I'm kinda thankful in having a Biology-based background...helps for easier understanding of the topic...  I'm not going to get ahead of myself with the belief that I can take this module easily...I'm a college man now remember?   What do I dislike about my course? Not having the likes of the CAE gang or Shirley, Chiak, Rita and Jo around...These people make studying fun....

       Visions of Arsenal's downfall...   It seems like my locally based best friend has finally found himself a girlfriend...power to ya man!!!  Ok...but enough about that...  Just finished watchin the Arsenal VS Manchester Utd football match...  I hafta admit I have never before been so emotionally involved in watching a match...I was cursing the Arsenal players left and right...  It ended one goal a piece...Thierry Henry scoring a beautiful goal while Louis Saha equalising late in the game...  Henry was later seen so pissed off at Kolo Toure for not giving him a chance to score a goal...gesturing like a madman...  I believe I have witnessed the downfall of Arsenal which will see them get knocked out of both the FA Cup as well as the Champions League within the next two weeks...  For those who don't believe my visions...let me remind you that I forsaw the downfall of my beloved Manchester United when they signed the Chinaman Dong...

       The College Man...   I just witnessed the birth of the college man within me...I think the scare I had last week and the discussions with friends who are in the various unis here, in the states and in australia made me realise that nobody can get a degree just cruising through school...  Contrary to popular belief...I now know that even though I'm doin my degree privately and with a relatively light per-module basis doesn't mean I can put in less work and still make the grade...  I'm still cramming a semesters workload in about six weeks...I'm taking as much classes as my friends are...so it's only right I kick it up a notch and pay my dues...  From here on out you'll see me hitting the books more often...though of course that don't mean I'm taking time off from my regular schedules...  I've always had that mentality...but immaturity always gets the better of me...  The buck stops here...

       Dead Tired   Played tennis for 3 hours yesterday afternoon despite the fact that I was suffering from the fallout of the lack of rest the night or rather the morning prior to it...Despite the 9 hour beauty sleep I got last nite...I'm feeling like shit...1  My forehand was smokin'...beating Sky with superb passing shots...painting the lines with the ball... That's what I'm talkin bout!!!   Sad to say my backhand was way way off...found myself running around it so that I could use the forehand...note to self:  Use more of the backhand next time round...   Mobility wise was very surprising...Having more confidence in sudden speed bursts and directional changes...It's against better judgment...but then again...when you have my mentality...every small thing like that boosts the confidence levels...  And so I proclaim today a rest day...   Let the body regeneration begin...

       The Beautiful People   Went clubbing with Sarah's peeps today...Beautiful people I'd hafta say...and I wasn't out of place...  Was smitten by this girl who I believe is the Chinese doppleganger for a Thai friend whom I had a crush on...damn...she was hot!!!  It's been a while since I last went clubbing...kinda miss the loud eardrum-bursting music, the smell of spilt booze, as well as the ever-so-tempting allure of second hand smoke...  I think I kinda know how Rachmad feels when he goes clubbing down in Melbourne...the superficiality of it all...  I'm not saying that the people I just met are shallow...but it just seems that everyone is trying to outdo each other with the name dropping and stories about holidays in the Maldives...  We all did have some moments though...it was pretty much a getting to know you session for me...everyone asking the typical questions...and me likewise...amid the din of loud retro music and the swishing of alcohol...  Noticed that the beautiful people gravitated towards each other...and the ugly...erm mediocre...were amongst themselves...it's the apartheid all over again...of course...lucky shallow me...I walk amongst the beautiful people...  But then again I could have just been deceived...seeing the world through beer goggles induced by the multiple tequila shots and vodka 7ups...

       24hours, 4 movies, 1 ex-girlfriend, 1 fling...what more could I ask for?   Wow...talk about having a lot of stuff happening in one day...  I completed my movie marathon of Minority Report, Xmen, and Happy Gilmore at 6am...finally woke up at 2pm...so much for going to the gym today...  Had to return some of my DVDs at Parkway Parade...took 31..surprise surprise...who do I see on the bus? An ex whom I havent seen in almost 2years...  Obviously we didn't want anythin to do with each other...she looked outta the window throughout the whole journey..and I...even though I've gotten over the way she treated me while I was in depression...still couldn't be bothered to initiate a conversation with her...  When she got off the bus...I checked her out...first thoughts?   My God!!! Her ass is HUGE!!!Thank God I ain't with her no more...   Went out with Sarah tonight...went to catch Runaway Jury...was good...predictable if you've read the John Grisham novel...but entertaining nonetheless...  Being an official fling...it's good in the sense that we both have no expectations of each other...it's good in a way...it's like being in a relationship...we both enjoy each others' company...but without the nitty-gritty of the fone calls and arguments...  Wait...I've only known her for about a month? or 5 wks tops...pretty sure an argument will come sooner or later...but hafta say the fone calls have been pleasant though...

       What just happened?   Shell-shocked...I knew the exam would be tough...but I never expected it to consume the whole textbook...  Jeez...I can take solice in the fact the group unity in my class turns out to true in the exam room as well...we had no idea what the hell to expect for the exam...and true enough...worst fears confirmed...  Still...I did bad...overconfident on the belief that my calculations on her final grading would mean only 10% would rely on the final paper...  Still...the fact that I did a fuckin' thesis for my take-home exam...That should pull me through if I happen to be a borderline case...Wait...didn't I just mention being too overconfident?  I'm still keeping my fingers X'ed that I'm right though...  Anyways...in either case...I can assume that I can pass this module...but without the quality grade though...  On a related story...the class ''friend''...Johnny...was A-OK right before the exam...joking, laughing with all of us as we entered the exam room...lo-and-behold...5 minutes into the paper...he claims to be ill...and left the exam room... What is up with that shit?  Well I'm not concerned about him or somethin...but hey...it was great comic relief after the paper...

       Bad Boys, Bad Boys, Watcha gonna do...   Feeling a whole lot better today...popped a coupla pills before goin to bed last nite...popped a coupla more capsules of good ol Vitamin C this mornin for good measure as well...  Was captivated by the manhunt for the 3 armed robbers at Pulau Tekong today...apparently they fled from Johor and wound up in P. Tekong...talk about jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire...  Finally got to see Singapore's finest in action...  So check it out...the news was giving coverage of it...showing the soldiers all decked out in their latest army threads...packing some heat with their assault rifles and such...  I can just picture them now...preparing to chase after the bad guys...cocking their weapons...shouting  Lock And Load!!!   And then when they finally catch the bad guys...they'll be shoutin  Freeze Muthafuckas!!! Put the fuckin gun down!!!   Ah Hollywood...what would I ever do without you?

       A case of the sniffles...   I don't know what happened to me today...but seems like I've caught a cold...been sniffing the whole day...popped a couple of cold tablets...did the trick for a while..put me out to sleep...woke just in time for supper...  I feel like shit...I'm trying to study for Saturday's exam and here I am ending  up blogging...  I have no idea what to study and whatever has been said about the exam format doesn't help at all...Without any idea of what to expect for the paper...seems like I'm goin in there blind...  Here's another bad thing...seems the professor's exam breakdown has gotten to me abit...  The way I see it...I'm more or less guaranteed a pass in this subject...it's just a matter of how bad I want that "A"...I'd hafta say I'm walking the thin line separating arrogance and stupidity here...  It's  Intro to Anthropology  back @ CAE all over again...that turned out well though...  Just hoping that it goes the same path here...

       Seeing the fruits of my labor...   I've finally printed out the majority of my project today...looks a whole lot better when I see it on paper..  While I can't say that it has my official seal of approval, it seems pretty good...considering that I know jack shit about Art...  Well I say 30 plus pages of bullshit for 4 questions is good enough...don't you think?

       Capoeira comes a calling...

I'm pretty sure that the capoeira documentary I saw on National Geographic had something to do with it...  Ah well...I think I betta go look up some of the old Sunday east coast park capoeira gang to see whether I'm up to it or not...

       It's the little things that matter...   I had to go down to the museum to get my project done today...and out of the blue I decided to call Sarah out to dinner...  Finally admitted to her that I wasn't in the market for a long term/serious relationship right now...and surprise surprise surprise...I'm actually her rebound guy...  I feel so.....USED!!!!....  Yeah right...It's all good baby...  Talking to Sky n Desiree tonight...then somehow between the two of them I got sidetracked into talking about Rina...  Instead of bringing me down, the topic actually brought a smile to my face...  It made me kinda realise how much I didn't see everything in perspective...  Sure I had a rollercoaster time with Rina...but it took me tonight to realise how much I enjoyed the small things that we did together...From the way she smiles after a kiss on the forehead, to the way she imitates my dumb-ass look whenever I say something stupid...  I think Eric Clapton had that exact message in mind when he wrote  Wonderful Tonight ...   It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear. She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair. And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."  We go a party and everyone turns to see This beautiful lady that's walking around with me. And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?" And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight."  I feel wonderful because I see The love light in your eyes. And the wonder of it all Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.  It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head, So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed. And then I tell her, as I turn out the light, I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight. Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."

       Vivaldi can stick his baton up where the sun don't shine...   Frustration...Deadlines...Vivaldi...Baroque music...  I've had enough of this...tried to finish off the music question today...probably have spent a total of 6 hours on it...maybe more...but then again I don't work that hard anyway...  I don't know why...but I love the incorporation of violins in rock or pop music...Janet Jackson, The Verve, Aerosmith, and now Britney does it with  Toxic ...I love that song...and I'm not saying this just because of the music video...  Back to the original topic...we got sidetracked from violins there...  Anyway I'm still going according to schedule...not time to panic yet...but then I've got to start studying for my exams as well...  Oh shit...

       So this is what it comes down to...   I went out with Sarah again on Friday night...seems that we're not really a 'movie' couple...its just talk, drink, eat, play pool, talk somemore...the usual I guess...but then again...i hardly think that we're a couple at all...and i'm not just saying that cos I ain't gettin no nookie...at least not yet...  She's bubbly, terrific company, crazy and not to mention cute...I shouldn't be complaining...but then again...I'd hafta say that we're both quite passive in the early stages of this so-called courtship...  I call it passive because unlike the previous relationships that I've been in, there are no calls ( How are you? What are you doin? ), there are no cutesy SMS messages that pepper one another's mobile phones (  Hi..I miss you :) )...in short...no smothering attention seeking shennanigans...its just the midweek  what are ya doin this weekend?  call...  I should be happy...since this is always what I figured I always wanted in a potential relationship...but I'm not...  Clarisse and her new bf (I've just given up on trying to remember their names) have put this relationship as a no-hoper...it appears as if both of us just can't be bothered at all...they believe that me n Sarah are just 2 single lonely people who take solice in the company of one another without the high expectations of a serious relationship because we're both busy with our own thang...  Me, I have my projects to think about...not to mention thinking about accepting a freelance job offers that pay like dirt...note...I don't hit paydirt...they literally pay dirt...  And in my current financial status...I think my expenses incurred on the job will far outweigh the financial gains (if you can call it that)...  For the first time in a long while I seek the advice of my banker, financial advisor as well as 'boss' all rolled into one...namely....the Parental Units..  The Parental Units told me that my priorities now are getting my groove back into study mode and not be distracted by job hunts... which if translated in my lingo " get your papers, then a job, then get outta my house "...  Knowing my intentions of moving away from here after graduation, they acknowledge that while work experience will help me get there in the long run, they also highlighted the fact that I'll be right where I started again when I move elsewhere...meaning I'd hafta go and prove myself again...  They're right...right now it's time to work on my Art term paper again...  Cue :  Vivaldi's Four Seasons (Spring)

       What is wrong with me?   I'm having trouble with my take-home exam...I've 4 questions to do and I'm stuck right at the first hurdle...  It's an Art paper...and I hate art...  I think I expect too much from myself...Always having something to prove when the pen touches paper, or in this case, the fingers touch the keyboard...  Think I'll just hafta go back to basics...

       Dude...is she sleeping???   Time and again I encounter lotsa weirdos in my condominium gym...  There was this homo who tried to chat me up...kinda freaked me out at first but was sorta flattered when my friend told me that I can be considered a hottie if I'm approached by a homo since they had to uphold such high homosexual standards...  Just a few days ago there was a couple of 'mats' trying to sneak into the gym...asking me for help...saying that they didn't bring their keycards to enter the gym...Needless to say I didn't help them...Why? Cos you don't own the keycard u doofus!!! I hafta register with your resident's card to obtain the keycard...Being the kind soul that I am, I directed them to the management office to make a fool of themselves...And of course...minutes later i see them leaving the clubhouse under the watchful eye of a security guard...  GET OUT AND STAY OUT!!!  Off all the weirdos out there...I think today's episode takes the cake...  Went to the gym in the afternoon with Clarisse since she took the day off...Towards the end of my workout...An old lady was using the ab-roller machine...So intending not to waste any time waiting for her to finish, I continued with my incline presses while C went to work on her triceps...  Several sets and 10minutes later, C approaches me and asks me to take a look @ the lady on the ab-roller machine...  Our reaction?   Dude...Is she asleep?   Believe me...she sure was...I was sitting there trying not to laugh my ass off...I in fact did try to check that if she was stil breathing...  However the thought that the lady was dead did cross my mind though...Thankfully she wasn't...Which meant that we'd still be able to use the ab-roller machine...

       Power is nothing without control...   What a difference six pounds make...Took my tennis racquet over to be restrung to 66lbs last week and it had its first outing on court today...  I hafta admit that I was very disappointed when I first played with it six weeks ago...disappointed enough for me to question why I bought it in the first place...but after today it feels like an entirely different entity...Able to impart lotsa spin onto the balls and boy does it feel good...  I was hitting balls hard and they were landing in the court...well at least most of them were...Power and precision...ok..so I hafta work on the precision part...  It was a good day...getting used to the feel of the racquet, playing tennis guilt free cos I wasnt worried about one of my projects...

       Time for a breather...   It's time for a breather...I've been working on my  Oklahoma!  paper as well watching live football matches on cable...Technically it's hard work...having to concentrate on both the paper as well as the tv...not in that order of course...  I'm tryin to finish this off tonight...or at least get a potential draft done with a little tweaking left here and there...been having too much fun this weekend...  As mentioned, got wasted at Rudi's BBQ on Fri nite...But here's somethin new...finally went on another date on Saturday...hmm...that makes it the 2nd one following my re-entry into the wild world of singlehood...It's not much...but at least I'm trying to get back on the bandwagon again...  Finally went out Clarisse's friend Sarah... Yes people...I date local girls as well...For those who don't know her, she's the one witnessed my walking into the gym glass door incident...which in my defense she found very amusing... I meant to do that...   Nothin special...just the usual italian food dinner... How predictable ...here's a change though...no movie...but played pool...She whooped my ass, and I didn't let her win....hmmm...I think it's the first time I played pool on a first date...then after that a lil chat over coffee at Starbucks before sending her home...  She's pretty cool to hang out with...but I must admit I'm not being fair to her...Throughout the date I found myself time and again comparing her to Rina...It's bad...but then old habits die hard...  I'd like to go out with her again...but not if I still have this mentality...

       Time Flies...   It's been almost 5 months since I last saw her...can't believe time flies so fast...  Feeling apprehensive to see her again...lotsa complicated feelings and issues are bound to be brought to the fore....  Desiree made me realise that I have no more pictures of Rina in my computer...but then again that is my M.O.....erase all evidence of ex girlfriends...  I will try to play it cool this time around...just in case I screw up big time again then its like the last time all over again...  More on talking to Des...after god knows how many years I've known her...she only find out tonight that I spoke Tagalog...  And so the questions about how I became, in her words "GP Superstar"... Well it came with a lot of hours watchin Airwolf and Knight Rider during my primary one days...  And the inevitable question of whether I evesdrop on Tagalog conversations I hear...OF COURSE I DO...I just turn down the volume on my minidisc...so that I can hear the juicy gossip...

       Out of Sight, Out of Mind   Rina will be flying back this week to celebrate her birthday here with all of us...  I can't stop thinking about her...though I'd hafta say that listening to Class95 on the radio doesn't help either...first up was Rod Stewart's  Have I Told You Lately ...and following that was Firehouse's  Here For You ...definitely the wrong songs to listen to when having these feelings...

       Women...Sigh...   I just finished talking to a friend...the usual crap...when all of a sudden the topic turns to physical attractiveness...  Then she gets all touchy about how she looks and all that...Saying that she dislikes the way she looks...To be honest...I think she's quite cute...  And so I said that she don't look too bad...then she tells me to stop being nice...so I say 'think positive thoughts'...  Cue: Triumph the Insult Comic Dog   I Kid!!! I Kid!!!   She thinks that I'm patronising her and ends the conversation...Talk about a fuckin no-win situation...  Yes I understand that it is a superficial world we live in...but it's all up to you to determine whether you look good or not...who gives a shit about what other people think about your looks...afterall...I'm willing to bet that they ain't no Tom Cruise or Tyra Banks either...

       Nicoll Highway Collapse   A part of Nicoll Highway collapsed today...so far 1 dead...3 missing...  Ended up being involved in a debate with my new classmates about the way the Transport Minister handled the situation...  They believed he was right in focussing on how much delay this incident would have on the new MRT line...he hardly acknowledged the dead man or the 3 missing people...  I'm pretty sure if the dead guy was a Singaporean...he's response to the media would be a pretty different story...  On another note....did a stupid thing today...went to test out the new punching bag...without boxing gloves...busted up my knuckles pretty good...

       My New Toy...   I've found a new toy to keep me occupied during my gym sessions...  Just found out that they've installed a punching bag in the grimy old basement gym...   That's what I'm talkin bout!!!   Finally, no more working out @ Rudi's place for the sake of the punching bag...I've my own now...technically not mine...but still...open season on the bag...  Now all I gotta do is get a set of boxing gloves and I'm good to go...

       Scared Shitless...   I went for a late night jog about an hour ago...Was feeling hot...and the growing feeling of frustration of being cooped up at home was getting to me...So I had to let it all out...  Everything seemed cool...Ran for about 4km around the estate compound...Had enough gas in the tank for another kilometer or so...Hence decided to add another round to this session...  Reached the back end of the complex...near the back gate that leads to the underpass to East Coast Park...It was dark down there...and all of a sudden there was this lady who was sitting on the jogging path...staring into the huge tree trunk that lined the path...  Weird thing was she didn't flinch or anythin when she saw me comin round the bend...surely flinching or lookin @ my direction would be a natural human response...But she didn't...she just stared blankly into space...  So off I continued running...till I decided to look back when I was about 30m away from her...u know...to see whether she had a shadow or somethin...well she was in the shadows of the trees...so I couldn't make out if she had one...  Screwed it..that was enough to make my hair stand on end...decided to weasel my way home by taking the brightly lit path along the road...  That's the last time I go jogging out at night...

       Nah nah nah nah! Nah nah nah nah! Hey hey hey! Goodbye!   I've decided to stop seeing Sarah because I'm feeling claustraphobic with all the attention she's been giving me...  She's a nice girl and all...fun to hang out with and all that...I enjoyed the few weeks that we've been seeing each other...but I don't need someone to who wants to know each and every move I make...  I think the final straw that broke the camel's back was when she SMSed me "Whr R u?"...while knowing full well that I was in class...   That's It!!!!   Well I know this isn't gonna be the end...I've a knack for finding someone who loves to make my life just that lil bit harder...

       My very own Florence Nightingale   Spent more time with Sarah today...hafta say that I've seen the brighter side of a potential relationship with her...  She seemed really concerned when I told her I might have sprained my back while we were in the gym earlier...She scored big here...

       The power of Christ compells you...   Easter weekend has come and gone without much incident...  Despite the numerous invitations to attend mass...I am glad to inform you that none of them have succeeded in bringing me back...I am still on track to my once a year pilgrimmage to church during Xmas...  Even invites from cute Catholic girls were not heeded...however...if they were naughty Catholic girls in short plaid skirts and knee high socks though...hmmm...

       Deja Vu   Had an argument with Sarah on Friday night cos she found out that I was out with the boys to catch the Liverpool - Arsenal match when it was obvious that she had asked me out way before any plans was made with the boys...  Ok..I admit I'm wrong...but then again I didn't make any promises...She was also pissed cos I didn't even invite her to go clubbing with me and my classmates on Wednesday night...  I'm like...what the hell???   Since when were we considered an official couple? Complete with nightly " How's your day? " SMS reports and invitations to meet others' friends...  Anyway guilt got the better of me and decided to spend some time with her cos some people might think of me the wrong way...  Ended up in Tampines where I took in the sights and sounds of the Mall of Suburbia...  I gotta do somethin about this...Sarah is beginning to look like another Michelle....

       I'm getting old...   Here I am...feeling the after effects of last night's clubbing session to celebrate the end of the Psychology module...  Feeling dead tired...drained...and somehow the weather is getting to me...been hella hot here for the past few days....hmm..this didn't happen a few years back...I remember that I've been able to sustain 3-day clubbing marathons(thur,fri,sat)...guess that's what the hands of time can do to ya...  Anyway back to last night...people got wasted...the music was good for a while...then it sucked the rest of the night...well the booze was cheap anyway...started off with 4 shots of tequila to get our groove on...then followed by the incessant arrival of jug after jug of booze...  I'm probably gonna switch the study mode off for the next few days...think i need a break from the sustained quizzes Dr. Olsen gave us over the past 9 days...can you imagine that? I actually finished reading an entire Psychology text in the space of less than 2 weeks...  Good Lord...I haven't done this much reading in a long long time...no wonder I feel burnt out....  Oh tomorrow's Good Friday...what does it stand for again?

       It's a small world afterall...   Realised the fact that I've been living in a very very small world...  It's a bit disheartening to find out that there is no running away from the social circle I happen to run in...  It's a cause for concern when I look at this circle and notice that my ex girlfriend as well as the girl that I've been more or less dating all belong within this small world as well...  Well i knew it could happen when I first met her...thought nothin abt it at first...but now the magnitude of this entangled web of friendships has somehow hit me...  It also doesn't help when I realise that my confidants are within this circle as well...  It's kinda like Friendster...but in a real life situation where all your paths are on a collision course...  While it's safe to say that this collision course won't do much damage...there is still the possibility of feelings being hurt...

       Playing with balls...   I'm still hangin' in there...barely keeping up with my readings...but motivated by the fact that keeping the scores up in the daily quizzes Dr. Olson dishes out means that I'd have less to worry about come the final day of reckoning...  Was pleasantly surprised by Sarah's early morning wake up call asking me if I was in the mood to play tennis...technically 'play' was not the operative word here...it was more like 'teach'...  Who was I to say no?   I'd hafta say it was an entirely new experience for me...never before have I dated anyone who had a remote interest in tennis...of course I know she has no interest in tennis...I think she's just trying to cheer me up...  So there she was on this hot morning trying her darnest to hit the ball into the other court...kinda appreciated her effort in spending the time with me...knowing the amount of joy I get from playing with my balls...no pun intended...  And here I was thinking that this relationship had no strings attached...

       Temper Temper...   I think the intensive sessions of a chapter or 2 a day has finally gotten to me...  Was doing my readings while listening to Blink 182's new album in my cd drive...then the fuckin drive wouldn't open when I was done...  Temper flared...my foul mouth began shooting off  Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Shit!   Started resetting computer again and again to get the damn cd  drive to release my brand new cd...no can do....  More  Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Shit!   Finally had enough...went off to the PS2 to vicariously live out my fantasies of life as a pro football player and a Navy Seal through  Winning Eleven 7  and  SOCOM US NAVY SEALS 2   Manually opened the cd drive...got the disc out...  Now thinking about whether I should go back to my work...while the International Friendlies are on tv...  I think you kinda know the answer to that predicament...

       Terror Alert    Warning:   If you are offended by the following entry, you might just be a terrorist.   From the set of  Pirates of the Carribean , I present to you...  Abu Hamza...the one-eyed, hook-handed terrorist/pirate...ah fuck it...I don't know how to describe his sorry ass...  Catch him while you can  urlLink here   C'mon...you gotta be kiddin me? This has got to be joke right? Hahaha  Donald Rumsfeld...enough games, as if the prisoner tortures weren't enough...now you guys go out and make fun of this British Muslim cleric...  I've heard of terrorists disguising themselves to be like the common folk...but what the hell? I mean...look @ him!!!   In case the link doesn't work and you can't see his face, he really does have only one good eye and a hook as a hand...All he lacks now is the pirate costume, the parrot on the shoulder, a hat, and of course...the peg leg...   Arrh!!! Yee Mateys!!!!   This would work great if he manages to capture a pirate ship and do suicide attacks on warships out at sea...the sailors won't see it coming...cause they be laughin their asses off...  To be honest I'm quite surprised that he wasn't involved in the attack on the USS Cole in late 2000...

       You're so selfish...   I went to see my surgeon today for my checkup on the injury...It's all good...  Then he asked me about my workouts...which I honestly gave details about my weight-training, tennis and jogging sessions...  Of course he told me off...due to my injury...I am not allowed to jog...let alone play tennis...but suggested that I go back swimming instead...  I've always been a stubborn dumb-ass...so why change now?  Told Rina about it...to say that she's unhappy about out would be an understatement...  Had an argument again where she accused me of being selfish towards how other people feel when I go under the knife...  Well does she or any of the 'other people' know how it feels to go out of surgery and onto a long hard road to recovery?  Is it wrong to go out and do things that make me feel good? Afterall...Exercise releases endorphins...same substance that I believe is released during sex...think about it...see the connection?  Also...Exercise relieves stress...I've a lot of shit going on in my life that needs stress relief...  Anyway I'm in the best shape that I've been in for a long long time...Again...that makes me feel good...  A lot of you guys out there can also vouch for the fact that I'm a better person to be around with when I'm happy...  I understand that there are people out there who care for my well-being...but they hafta know that I'm living my own life here...  True...I'm damaged goods and I've got the physical and emotional battle scars to prove it...I know I'm asking for trouble with the way I live my life now...but fuck it...what are you gonna do? Make me live my life as a spectator?  There's no denying the fact that I gonna have more time on the operating table in years to come...well it just so happens that I'm kinda fast-forwarding it a few years...

       I take that back...    I don't watch foreign films because I don't like to read the subtitles.   I take that statement back...  Just caught Luc Besson's  Wasabi  tonight...French/Japanese flick starring Jean Reno, of  The Professional  and  Godzilla  fame, and this little Japanese hottie...You know the story...Bad ass French cop, Japanese fling dies suddenly, leaving behind daughter to bad ass French cop, who happens to be father of hottie. Hottie gets embroiled in Yakuza. People die. Hero flies off victorious. You know...typical Luc Besson flick...  Hey Sky...help me out here...What's that lil Japanese hottie's name again?  I think it's time I start watching the more foreign flicks...I've seen a couple of em this year...there was this Japanese samurai flick...can't remember the title...Then there was this other Japanese flick...again I can't remember the title...  Oh...I wanna catch  City of God ...hey at least I remembered the title...

       Hypochondriac no more...    Hypochondriasis - A somatoform disorder characterized by an excessive preoccupation with or fear of developing some physical condition.   I have been suffering from acute hypochondriasis over the past week since finding out that my brother had contracted Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease (HFMD)...  I reacted that way for fear that I might get it before the exam last Saturday...  To be honest...I think I might have gotten it...I showed one of the symptoms...though they aren't as bad as my bro's though...a coupla' small blisters on my fingers and toes...but they're gone now...So it's all good...  But...it ain't on my foot and/or mouth...it was on my fingers and toes...Enuff said...  It's funny how some of the conversations I had regarding this issue developed...Below are the compressed versions recalled to the best of my ability...   Female Reaction to HFMD victim  Me: Sweetie...I think I might have HFMD...got blisters on my finger and toe... Rina: Yeeee...It's a good thing I'm gone...If I'm there I want you to stay the hell away from me...no need for you to hold my hand... Me: Whateva happened to 'in sickness and in health, til death do us part?' Rina: Well if we get married, we'll write our own vows...and you can leave those lines out...   Male Reaction to HFMD victim  Sky: So how? Playing tennis @ your place on Thurs right? Me: Can...But hafta warn you I showing symptoms of HFMD... Sky: Shit man...I dun wanna go near you or your house... Me: I just suspect it lah...Come play lah...can play PS2 as well... Sky: I dun wanna take chances...we play when you get better... Me: Wah lau!! We wipe down PS2 controller lah...It's not like I'm gonna spit @ you right...cos it's transmitted that way...anyway I'm goin to the gym... Sky: Eh you gonna spread the disease issit? Me: Yeah...so if there's an outbreak of HFMD among white people...you know where it came from...  Anyway I read up on HFMD...nothin to worry about...no medication needed...caused by the Cocksucky (Coxsackie) virus...disappears in about a week...  Tough luck people,   I'm still alive...

       While I was out...   Wow...so much has happened since I last updated this thing...let's see...  Welcome to the compressed version of my weekend...  1. Psychology paper - Confirmed quality grade if I didn't fuck my project up.  2. Extremely high self-esteem due to the finding out of a little known fact that some hottie friend of mine actually had the hots for me some time back...but unfortunately I share too much of my relationship problems with her, which led to her saying to a confidant,  Why the hell did I have a crush on him in the first place?  Damn, I must've said somethin nasty to get a reaction like that... *New Bill to be passed in Congress if I become President  The crusher has to let it be known to the crushee that there is indeed a crush in progress   3. Felt under the weather on Sunday due to Hay Fever (in singapore???)  4. Common sense finally prevailed - skipping of gym workout on Monday for fear of aggravating hay fever symptoms...  5. On a 6week break from school - what I'm gonna do during this time...and where I'm gonna get cash...I have no idea...  6. Might have avoided a potential confrontation with 5 drunk 'mats' by not overtaking them whilst walking thru the Sennett neighborhood from the MRT at 1am in the morning...yeah...lotsa shit happens in that neighborhood...I don't think telling 5 of em to  Relac lah brudder  would've helped...would've seen thru my 'wanna-be mat' disguise... Personal note : I think I would've robbed myself if I'd known what I was packin that day...a $650 digital camera and a $750 watch...not to mention a cheap ass cell fone and an empty wallet...  7. Again...common sense prevails...5 vs 1...I don't like the odds, cmon...who would?...If it was 1 vs 1 I could've taken down the mat if he wanted to get it on...but 5? I don't think so...  8. Oh yeah...speaking of mats...New look for the Peninsula Plaza mats...get this...hat (not cap, not beenie, but hats), vests, pants that end 2 inches above the shoe...What the fuck?????And they were a group...all dressed alike...once again..What the fuck??? I mean...I know you fellas trying to look upmarket...but then again...A wee bit OTT right?  9. Long lost crush I haven't spoken to in a while SMS's me long distance asking for home address cos she's gonna send a package...maybe it's a letter bomb or anthrax spores...but then again...I don't think I've pissed her off...so I should be safe...but a friend of mine did...but that don't mean that I'm the target right? It's nice to know I still exist in her world...  Well I think that's about it...

       Life is sweet...   After 2 months of waiting...I finally got the results of my Art module that I did earlier this year...got an A+ for it...If you asked me what I wanted right after that paper...I would've said that I'd be happy with a C...  This comes as a major boost ahead of Saturday's paper...I'm pretty much good to go...whenever the mood to study is lost...that means I'm ready...  Well anyway life seems to be treating me well on all fronts at this point in time...save for my current financial situation which I've brought upon myself...but hey...i think it's time to find sources of income for myself...

       Tick Tock...   Well I'm pretty much all set for this Saturday's exam...at least that's how I see it...  Already done my pre-exam ritual of watching a movie...Caught Kill Bill Vol.2 with Clarisse...after that the usual talk about her favorite topic...her visions of my future life with Rina...  I decided to entertain her 'visions'...but then again she's the one who introduced us in the first place...So I think if we really hook up in the end then she'll see that her match-making venture did bear fruit in the end...  I've one more day to go before I fully get the books out of my way...Remember I do not open my textbooks on exam eve...Maybe I'll sneak a peak tomorrow...it's Thursday...just to clarify some of the things that have yet to be fully understood...  Of course I have some doubts about my study and pre-exam rituals...but then again there's always the case of the pre-exam jitters setting in...  Well as I always say...   Whateva Floats Your Boat...

       TV Overload...   With my exam days away...I find myself slacking off when I should expect myself to be hitting top gear...  But then again I'm ready as I'll ever be for the upcoming Psyc paper...So no worries about failing...more on what grade I'll be getting though...  Caught the concluding episodes of the All-Star Survivor...and I'd hafta say that both Rob and Amber, the winner, are like the ultimate players in any Survivor I've seen...Afterall, they played the game the way it was meant to be played...As for the extra million that the viewers are gonna vote for...I'd say it'll either go to Rupert (on merit of his popularity) or Rob (for being a deserving winner)...  I wish sometimes life was kinda like that game...cos I've got so many people I wanna vote out of my life right now...granted there are also other assholes out there who want me out of their lives...I'd pay money to see that...me marooned on an island...with friends and assholes all around me...  Take this example of someone who wanted me to do her a favor tonight...I declined...then she just abruptly ended the conversation...Don't it just make you sick? She's already got my vote...  Also caught my first episode of The West Wing today...I know it's been around for a while...but somehow I just didn't find the prospect of watching politics that appealing...but surprise surprise...I actually found it quite gripping...the hypothetical scenario of the kidnapping of the President's daughter...

       Separating The Men from The Boys...   It's always been said that  The way to tell the men from the boys are by the size of their toys ...  As I slowly walk away from the throes of youth and enter my mid 20s...I realise that the toys I covet aren't your usual run-of-the-mill kinda things...  Right now I'm more interested in planning on what to get for my 24th Birthday coming in about 7 months time...I'm planning ahead cos I need to save up for what I'm planning to get myself...  Initially there was a skydiving jump...but I've decided to scratch that idea til I move to the States as it's a whole lot cheaper there...well to be honest...I don't really trust the jumpsite in Malaysia...like it ain't safe...c'mon...we're talking about Malaysia here...And so...I've decided to push this back til I enter another milestone in life...probably before I say goodbye to bachelorhood...or before I turn 30...whichever comes first...  Then there is the tattoo I want to get...images of my eyes n eyebrows tattooed on the back of my neck...Sorta bad-ass tattoo if you ask me...there's a deeper meaning to that design though...which I'm too lazy to spell out...But right now I'm wondering what it'll look like when I'm 80...but then again I don't think I'd live that long...  After that comes the midlife crisis...I'd probably be looking to trade-in the wife for a more better looking model about half her age...  Cue for Triumph the Insult Comic Dog :  I kid! I kid!   Nah...I'd probably get myself that Lamborghini I always wanted...to pick up young sweet thangs half my wife's age...  And so comes to material gains...which I believe would be the most likely thing I'd get myself as I enter my mid-20s...Eye on the prize...the iPod or iPod Mini...still gotta upgrade my computer to use it though...  We'll see...

       Talk about an easy lay...   Grace wrote about the so-called 'sex bands' that happen to be going around the local schools...  It's like they wear black rubber bands on their wrists and when someone breaks it...it means that the person wants to sleep with you...  Wow!!! How come I haven't heard of this?  God damn...If this was in season when I was in school...I would've bought packs of the stuff to put on my wrist...

       Back to the same ol song and dance...   Wow...I'd have to say that Rina probably had the most ultimate of birthdays...  A trip to Phuket, a few days here with friends in Singapore, 3 major birthday celebrations...all in the space of a week...jeezzz....wonder what I'd hafta do to make my upcoming one reach that sorta magnitude...  Well she flew off this evening...back to the same routine for me...  I'm kinda happy she decided to spend her birthday back here...kinda reminded us of old times...  She didn't change one bit...and I presume so did our feelings for each other...still acting like the item we used to be...  As degrading as it sounds...Actually found it quite amusing when she kept referring to me as "My Idiot Boyfriend"...  This time round there weren't any conversations regarding where this relationship is going...or on what official status we are in...If she comes back for her visits and we're both not seeing other people...cool...if we happen to find someone else...then I guess that's just how it goes...  I've decided to forget about all that...we'll just see what happens everytime she returns...no point worrying about that now...I've my priorities and I intend to stick to them...

       I want one of those...   Is it just me? Or does anyone else notice that the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer?  Just found out and saw for my own eyes that the guy who owns the black  urlLink Lamborghini Diablo VT 6.0  in the estate went out and got another identical orange Diablo...What a sight...two Diablos sitting side by side...  Jeez...Doesn't this guy have anything else better to do with a million bucks?   On a different note,  I've decided to take a hiatus from my duties of playing "Big Brother" to some of you guys...  I've my priorities and problems of my own and it's time to be selfish and tell you to get off my fuckin' back...  I shall not be entertaining anyone else for the next two weeks...   Ladies and Gentlemen,  Elvis has left the building...

       The Point of No Return   There comes a time in a relationship when either one of the parties involved becomes too possessive over the other one...  I think my relationship with her has crossed that threshold...To be honest it's quite scary...She's been possessive in the past...but never to this level...  It's a mixed bag actually...Can this be considered as a serious relationship? Since we're seeing each other on/off for the past...What? Year, year and a half? If this is the case...Then I'd hafta say that this is the longest one I've been in...  On the other hand...Continuing with this would result in someone getting hurt when someone has to leave the country for good...I've been on the receiving end of that in previous relationships and ain't no way in hell am I planning to dish out the same treatment to her...  Right now it's still all good...with she being away...but not that far away...still get to see each other once, maybe twice in a couple of months...But of course things will change when I move away from this place...  That's still some time away...but then again...time flies...Guess I'll just go wit da flow on this one...  And since we're past the point of no return,  This is usually the part where I freak out and run away...

       Wayne's World   Just finished watching ESPN Sportscenter...There is too much news regarding the English...Rooney this, Rooney that, Roonaldo, Wayne's World...  Clips of the English fans shouting  Rooney Rooney Rooney ...  Just goes to show how fickle the human mind is...  After World Cup 98, Beckham became public enemy no.1 after he got sent off against Argentina...When he scored the free kick against Greece that sent them to World Cup 2002, he became God...so much so that they were willing to risk the team by playing a half fit Beckham...  Several weeks ago while the English Premiership was still on...people hated Rooney...afraid of the damage he is capable of inflicting on their team's defences...  Now here they are chanting his name...  I'm willing to bet that things will change once the new season starts...look for people hoping that Rooney gets injured before he lines up against their team...

       Through the Velvet Ropes...    We have a special need  To feel that we belong  Come with me inside  Inside my velvet rope    Everyone I know seems to have a problem these past few weeks...and it seems it comes from one of the three categories...Chicks, Dicks, or Cliques...Hmmm...sounds like a title for a low budget porn flick...  As a result...everyone turns to one another for advice and support...Me included...  Hmm...kinda sounds like one of those stress-release methods I learnt back in Psychology class...  I kinda wish that I had stuff to tie me up right now...No..not in that S&M kinda way...Be it school or work...working out does help...but it provides that temporary fix for only about a couple of hours...  I can turn to others...but then they'd just won't understand the magnitude of the problem...  It's funny...on one hand I've people who know the problem too well...while the other side knows diddly-squat...  It's times like these that I despise the fact that I have little or no confidants outside my main circle of friends...and believe me...that main circle is sure as hell a small one...  It's not that I don't open up easily...It's just that I've learnt the hard way not to let just about anyone through the velvet ropes...

       Italia! Italia!   Well Giovanni Trappatoni screwed himself pretty badly when he took out the offensive players don't you think?  Have faith in the boys...They're slow starters...I'm sure they'll do well when the chips are down against Bulgaria...  Was watching the Italy-Sweden match while talking on the phone with Rina...who's a self-confessed AS Monaco, Real Madrid and now Spanish supporter just because of Fernando Morientes... He's yummy ...I think that's probably why she's with me...being 1/8 Spanish all... Yeah Joe...milk it out...all 1/8 of it...   I'm trying to get her over to my side of the fence...By showing her that the Italians are hot as well...Well that's the only way I could get her to back the Italians...Thanks to me by the end of the night Italian surnames were rolling off her tongue...Buffon, Del Piero, Zambrotta...  One thing I didn't like was the reaction towards Gennaro Gattuso...Long story...She's like obsessed with him now...not as much as Morientes...but still...She says she likes his manly locks and beard... Very Grrr...   Anyway I told her not to get too dreamy over him...and she snapped back with this SAT question...   Gennaro Gattuso is to Rina as Jennifer Love Hewitt is to Joseph.   ... ... ...

       Anglo-American   I've always preferred my American sitcoms to the British ones...unless we're talking about the  Benny Hill Show  of course...anyone remember that?  I've always been a big fan of American sitcoms...they've probably been the mainstay of my prime time entertainment...Can't say the same for most of the British comedies though...To put it simply...They're lame...And don't even get me started on the local ones...Does anyone watch them at all? C'mon...Let's get serious...I've been told that an actor from a broadcasting company(let's not pretend we don't know where the series is from) who teaches drama claims that the company hires talentless pretty faces...  Caught my first episode of the American remake of the British sitcom  Coupling  today...  For the uninitiated, the original British version is kinda like  Friends  with a more raunchy storyline...I think that kinda explains why the American version is shown at midnight...  As is always the case, the originals are always better than the remakes...  Maybe it's because I've been familiar with the cast of the original...and hence could've seen through what the big executives at Universal are trying to do...cashing in on a tried and tested formula...  The characters stay the same, the setting stays the same...It seems like everything is the same...Except for the difference in the comedic timing of the Americans and English...  In comparison, it seems that the subtle British humor works a whole lot better for the context of the situations involved...  Now if only more British sitcoms can hold my attention that way...

       The Dopamine Dreamer   A couple of friends who had just had just begun reading my blog asked what the whole dopamine dreamer persona meant...Since I hardly use it as my nickname on MSN or ICQ...   Dopamine  -  A neurotransmitter that affects brain processes that control movement, emotional response, and ability to experience pleasure and pain.   Well I guess the definition above says it all...I'm the dreamer who is willing to ride the emotional and physical roller coaster that stands between him and his dreams...

       It ain't over til the fat lady sings...   Did I tell ya? Or did I tell ya?  Arrogance cost England the match against France...The fans were singing the national anthem long before the final whistle...Remember what I said? You guys should've sung  God Save Our Team ...  You should've seen the look on the English faces when they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory...It was so sweet...This coming from an Italian fan...Whateva did the English to do them?  I'm feeling under the weather...might have a cold...sure seems like it...I'm tired...I feel like shit...Wish she was here to nurse me back to health...I can't believe I'm actually writing this down...I can just see you guys now...Awww, Mr. " I don't need any woman to fuss over me " is actually longing for his girl to nurse him back to health...  Maybe it's the drugs talking...

       The Beautiful Game...   With Euro 2004 fever heating up...I've decided to lash out at all the England supporters out there...There is too much media exposure being focussed on the English this year...  Don't get me wrong...I support Manchester United...I love English football...but I hate the English National Team...  England will never win this tournament because they are arrogant...just because they were World Cup winners back in 1966 doesn't mean that they deserve to win again...  Michael Owen scoring a wonder goal versus Argentina in 98? Get over it...it's only a goal...last time I checked...FIFA gives the World Cup trophy to teams that actually win the tournament...  They expected a big win against the Japanese...only to draw 1-1 with Japan...and they struggled to contain the more upbeat Japanese...the same Japanese side that struggled to beat Singapore...hmmm..imagine that...  So...for you English out there...since your team is up against France this weekend...instead of singing  God Save the Queen ...I think you should consider singing  God Save our Team   Since we're on the subject...Singapore got whacked 7-0 by Oman in a World Cup 2006 qualifier the other day...Hmmm..I wonder why the local newspapers don't give much coverage on it?  For the record...I'm backing the Italians for this tournament...   Forza Italia

       Round and round we go...   Rina went back to Jakarta again today after an extended wkend of shopping...  It's funny how she can take 3 days leave off work for shopping and only spend less than a wkend when she comes to see me...not that I'm complaining...I guess I'd hafta thank the great singapore sale for seeing her back here so soon...  And so it's back to the perpetual cycle of her jetting back and forth, juggling her work and her man...I didn't pursue the usual matter of whether we're an item or not...let's leave it as it is...yes...we're an item...whenever we're in the same country...It's kinda like that theory of your not cheating on your significant other if the incident happens in a different area code...  I'm not about to get dragged in to another one of our omnipresent arguments that rarely result in victory for either side...they usually end in a single party storming off, slamming down the phone, or dishing out the silent treatment...  Being someone who can't keep his mouth shut...I find that being on the receiving end of the silent treatment cruel and unusual punishment...  And so that explains why I didn't bring up the sensitive issue of "Are we an item or are we not"...It's a merry-go-round...It happens everytime she flies back here for a visit...It's all good for now...  As much as this situation puts stress on both our lives...I guess we seem prepared to accept this unless something drastic happens...Something drastic in my case would probably be if I started dating someone else here in Singapore...Though I'd hafta say it'll be an unlikely scenario...unless I really see somethin special in that person...  On a different note...I just found out that I would be Freddy Kruger should I go mental and embark on a killing spree...   urlLink     I kinda agree with all these...except the dog ugly part...but then again...I want a Pug...and people think it's a fuckin ugly dog...  Oh the kids? Yeah...don't you just wanna shut those 7-10 year olds up?

       Is this reason enough for you?   I thought Hoobastank's  The Reason  meant something...Kinda thought that it could be applied to the situation I have with Rina right now...  But come to think of it...I don't think that I would want to change myself for a person...Cos afterall...isn't love supposed to be accepting someone for his/her imperfections?   I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

       Let's not assume...   I received a job offer from a production house this morning...a 2 month job offer ...this company seemed real hell bent on getting me though...called 3 times over the past 2 days...and when I finally called back an interview was set up later on in the evening...  Was kinda excited by it...the thrill of being on set and working behind the scenes...and it paid pretty well for someone like me who was only being offered an production assistant role...  Then came the realisation that it would clash with my classes...as much as I feel that I can juggle both work and school at the same time...My priorities took center stage as I called back an hour later to politely decline the offer...  It may sound stupid...rejecting a pretty good deal that paid well and was something that would help me later on in my career...But I think the risks outweighed the advantages...  I was gonna have long working hours...which could start anywhere from 7am til the wee hours in the morning...And the prospect of juggling my morning classes with that seemed crazy...considering how drained I was during the previous production I undertook in December last year...and that was only a 2 week shoot...this one was 2 months...  Though it's unlikely I'd flunk a Journalism module, I don't wanna rest on my laurels and  assume  that I'd pass it without my 100% attention...  Remember...Assume is made out of  ASS es like  U  and  ME .

       Happy Anniversary   It's a year to the day of my  urlLink total hip replacement operation  on my hip injury...  Feels good to look back at how far I've come...2 operations in as many years, and here I am back playing tennis,playing better than I've ever had in all my years of tennis, fitter than I've ever been...though there's always room for improvement...  Surprisingly I've had some common sense knocked into me by Rina's hysterical reaction towards my nonchalant attitude towards my surgeon's advice...I've stopped my jogging and replaced it with sessions on X-training machines and the stationary bikes...higher intensity workouts, with little or no impact on the hips...  As much as I'd love to continue my runs and other high injury risk activities to see how much I can withstand...I've come to realise that it's better to play safe...well not really...but I'm doing this in consideration of the emotional heartache my loved ones go through whenever I go under the knife...See? I'm not that selfish afterall...  Met up with the usual MDIS gang(Cheeks, Jo, Shirls n her bf,Reets, Aderm, and Mei)today 4 a coupla drinks and supper...only had a coupla Coronas at Harry's Bar...It's not DBL O...where my 2 bottles of Corona would equal 7 shots of tequila...the price tags coupled with the lack of funding explains the reserved drinking strategy...and of course for supper I indulged in my food vice...Prata...  Seems like everyone was reminiscing about the days back in the Advanced Diploma Course...thinking about the first days we met...our first impressions on each other...  I miss the days of competitive tennis, I miss my gangs in CAE and MDIS Adv Dip , and I miss the things I sacrifice at this point in my life...   I think Janet Jackson was right when she sang  Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

I'm slacking like I've never slacked before...feels good now that I've gotten to the swing of things...Looks like I'm gonna enjoy this whole month kickin' back...  I received my timetable for the next module...and it sucked...the feeling of receiving it I mean...  9am classes??? Are you freakin nuts??? How the hell am I supposed to wake up at 730 am when I normally go to bed at 530...

      Why wasn't I aware of this?  After almost 2 years of learning Capoeira and suffering injuries because of it, I have discovered that this isn't the only cool martial arts around...  Was watching Discovery channel the other day and came across  urlLink Systema ...check out the first video clip...the guy is sitting down and kicking ass...How hardcore is that????...I think it's kinda like Aikido...but then again...it's Russian...so it's bound to be more violent...  The show I caught on Discovery had a clip where the guy was blindfolded and yet fought off many assailants...hot damn!!!  A no-nosense style of self defence used by the Russian Spetsnaz or Russian Special Forces...damn...gotta find out where I can learn this...

      Do you want  urlLink this  to happen at the 2008 Shanghai Olympics?  I plead with you IOC...take away China's&nbsp;right to host the games...Look at what they've given the world...Nothin but misery...   SARS - we don't want our athletes getting SARS now do we? Don't correct me by saying people got the bug in HK...HK is part of China is it not?  Taiwan Issue - They've got a billion people on the mainland...Do they really need the Taiwanese? Come on Taiwan!!! Strive for your independence...  Singapore/China ties - Why do small countries like Singapore strive to suck up to the big guy?  Spratley Islands - Once again...they have room for a billion people...Do they really need the extra land?  Have they ever contributed to the world porn market? I think not...    signed:&nbsp;Phil McCracken,   Ben Dover,   Moe Lester,   Anita Dick,   Amanda Huggenkiss,   Harry Balls   PS. We think the article alone&nbsp;is enough reason to voice our concerns. However we decided to vent our frustrations at the other issues as well...Please do not go to the extent of having the various nuclear powers launch an attack of them though...Cos afterall, they gave us Wanton Noodles, Chee Chong Fun, Cream of Sum Yung Gai, Tupac Shakur, and not to mention Kung Pow Chicken...  &nbsp;

      Forgot to include in Friday's edition that me & Sky got busted by the SMRT Rent-A-Cop...I didn't know that the  urlLink experience  would scar him for life...  Random bag check for explosives and shit like that...Cos let's be honest...I look like a terrorist...with the goatee and stuff...According to Risse...I do look like a "Mat"...which is why the malay hottie probably scoped me out...*read previous entry*.... Jeez babe...Thanks a lot...   Anyway back to SMRT Rent-A-Cop...I'm cool with being checked and all...I mean, you can't be to careful these days...It's like people take the relatively safe environment of Singapore for granted...Would you want to be in a train that ended up like the one in Madrid?  I think not...   Yes...the random bag checks are an infringement of rights... Don't they need a warrant for that?  But if the bottom line means safer train rides...I don't mind the extra hassle...  It's not like there's any racial discrimination involved...at least that's how I see it...Cos afterall...I've only been stopped at that checkpoint once...Of course I'd find it amusing if I do get stopped more often...  And so to people who react like Sky...I plead to you...   Relac lah brudder...Lagi safe MRT...

      Hmm...it's been a while since I last wrote shit on my blog...and a lot of stuff has happened...Our relationship has hit the inevitable plateau which drains the life both of us out...  Decided to take the advice of several friends and move on with my life...as someone so perfectly put it,  You're 24,&nbsp;your missing out on a lot of things.&nbsp;You should be out there dating. Why are you trying to be faithful in a non-exclusive long distance relationship?    &nbsp;  Are you telling me that if&nbsp;____________ comes back and asks you out,&nbsp;are you&nbsp;still gonna be faithful to Rina and avoid going out with that person?    &nbsp; She's got a point there...I think I've come full circle...back to that old feeling&nbsp;I had where I just hung onto someone just to add some stability in my love life...   I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN   Went out for a date with my stalker on Wednesday...just your typical date...dinner...a couple of drinks...a night out at Zouk...  Didn't get wasted, more importantly...She didn't&nbsp;get wasted...  Surprisingly I showed up for the final tutorial class...to sign my name on the register to ensure that I had the kept at least 90% attendance for the module...Plus I had to meet Sky for a movie...and I knew if I didn't go to class then I'd probably leave him for dead in town since I would still be in bed til the early afternoon...  Funny thing happened on while we were crossing Scotts Road on the way to Lido...This&nbsp;malay&nbsp;hottie was eyeing me and I was eyeing her...It was so obvious that both of us were scoping each other out...So so so obvious to the point that&nbsp;the&nbsp;usually oblivious&nbsp;Sky actually noticed that it was going on...   Our eyes met as we passed, you knew what you want, I knew what I want...   In that fleeting moment everything seemed to stop,   The people around us, no longer mattered...   In those precious seconds after you passed...   I found my eyes glued to that nice perky red pants-clad&nbsp;ass of yours...    Shake it!!! Shake it!!! Shake it like a polaroid picture!!!   Hahahaha...Had you guys going there for a second right?&nbsp; Yeah..she&nbsp;was petite...she&nbsp;had a hot ass...she was wearing glasses, plastic brown/black frames...Hot Damn!!! Fuck'n A!!!  Hey!! You can't teach an old dog new tricks...You think I was really up for that poetry shit?  It was quite flattering actually...I mean I know some gals have been scoping me out...It's just that I usually find out after it happens...This time I actually witnessed it...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Beefcake!!!Beeeeeefcake!!!Beeeeeeeeeefcake!!!   Decided to scale back my workouts to have more time for myself...in other words...more afternoon naps, playtime with the PS2, and watching more DVDs...take note that I did not add the journalism project in there...  Anyway I realised that I need to gain weight...just realised that I've lost weight through my hardcore 4 or 5 day a week exercise program...a wee bit too much to my liking...Though gotta admit I look good though...but my narcissistic self think a few more pounds of lean muscle won't hurt...  The post-workout stoning session by the pool had me and my gym buddies talking about protein supplements and shit like that...which brought up the topic of Southpark's Eric Cartman... urlLink  WeightGain4000

       Leaving the Fortress of Solitude...   After several days in hiding, I have come out of my shell and have opened up all lines of communication to whoever...  I'd hafta say it feels good to be so distant from everyone else...helped me put things in perspective...  It was obvious I miss her a lot after not talking to her for almost 5 days...Spent almost an hour on the phone with her...watching the finale of the Fear Factor Couples special together...As usual... We could've done that  was the prevailing comment towards the various stunts...   Riiiiiiiiight ...As if we could've done the stunt in which the girl was locked in a box of 500 tarantulas while the guy has to free her by getting a locked hacksaw...The key of course is hidden in a pipe...the only way you can get it is by using your mouth to suck up some nasty stuff...blended crickets I believe it was...and spitting it into the pipe to retrieve the key...  She'd probably freak @ the sight of those tarantulas...Not that I would've put my face in the gross stuff either...but hey...If it gives me a shot @ the million dollar stunt...Why not?  Would love to have done one of the stunts though...in short...Car must be driven onto a ramp on back of a 16-wheeler...the catch? Driver blind-folded, partner has to be the driver's eyes...I think we could've made that stunt...  As for my other friends whom I have been avoiding...I haven't gotten round to telling them my leaving the Fortress of Solitude...and from the looks of it...I think it's gonna be a while before I go out and mend fences...Afterall...It's ain't my fault...

       Fade to Black...   I have gone back to basics and have resorted to screening phone calls and refusing to entertain online chats and pointless SMSes...  It's time to curl up with a good book...finally got the Bill Clinton autobiography in its virgin best...I'm one of the first few to get it from the local library...  I've managed to survive without my mobile phone for the past 2 days and counting...I still carry it around though...  But fuck it...It ain't a leash for you guys to yank whenever you need me...   If you can't respect that,  Your whole perspective is whack... Maybe u'll love me, When I fade to black...

      Went clubbing with Jo and Ash and a couple of Jo's friends...  Hafta say it sucked big time...Bad crowd, bad music...quite a turn-off actually...was better off saving my money, staying home and watchin tv...Well..lesson learnt...Maybe I'm too used to going clubbing with people who I'm close to....  Anyway decided to excuse myself early, meaning 1.45am...no point stickin around if I wasn't enjoyin myself...You know how it is when people go clubbing right? They have the exchange of cell fone nos. @ the end of the night...which I find totally superficial...  It's like we only met tonight...even then we were probably drunk or what...I won't remember you tomorrow...what makes you think I'm gonna call you in the future?

         Tennis  - @ NTU...played well...finally brought the wrist whip of the forehand into full view...adds that extra special sauce that I've been looking for...but the fear factor of aggravating my hip injury lingers...this time bigger than ever...maybe it's just me...maybe I'm growing old and self-preservation is starting to take a leading role in my self-destructive lifestyle...   Porno  - Someone who we all know gets introduced to Sabrine Maui. the Filipina porn star...I'd love to add a link...but we all know that it's 'illegal'...To my friend : I know why you don't like her...No braces like Avena Lee right? Please comment on this...I know you read my blog... you can post anonymously if you want...    Videogames  -  Winning Eleven 8  is out...and I'd say I'm one of the few people in Singapore who managed to get their hands on it way before the official release date of 5 Aug...OH MY GOD!!! Looks like I ain't gonna be sleeping much in the next few wks...talk about bad timing...Aug 14 Journalism exam...oooooooh boy.....   On another note...I got a call from MTV...everything stopped for that brief moment...til I realised that the call was about me winning a Sean Paul contest...So much for that internship application letter I sent them...
