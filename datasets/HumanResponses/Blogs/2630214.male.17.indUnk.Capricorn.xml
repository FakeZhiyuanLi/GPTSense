       Sorry, it has been a while since I posted. I am also a year older!! Eh, but what a horrible last day of 16 it was......  That night, it got a lot better though. For one, my parents gave me money, and money is good because I can buy stuff. Good times. Also, I was still really mad so I found someone to talk to and just dumped all my problems out and told her what I was feeling......and it helped a lot. She listened and gave me advice that really helped, which is what I needed. It was basically just a b!tch-fest, and I was doin all the bitchin. But she listened, and she is awesome for it.  So Thursday, my birthday, was really cool. Everyone I ran into seemed to know it was my b-day, which is a good feeling. Even though practice was at 5:50 AM, I felt as good as I had to be at practice all year. I was on fire. Hit 5 of 9 three's in one sequence.  So from Thursday to Friday......wow. Well Friday itself was fine, nothing unusual.......then fast-forward to the game. If I could sum it up, I'd say it was the most humiliating experience this season, if not in all my life. We were beating the absolute hell out of this team, yet my butt was glued to the bench. Wanna know exactly how bad it was? A kid who just came back from a 3-week trip to INDIA, where he didn't touch a basketball, played more than me. A kid who was playing his 2nd game on varsity level all season played more than me. I played a grand total of 3 minutes. My time keeps shrinking and I seriously do not know what I'm doing wrong. Especially since coach knew that I was hot on practice Thursday. I don't get it. Oh well. From now on I just have to change my view......if I expect not to play at all, then hopefully I'll be happy with whatever time I get. But trust me, I wasn't happy on the bench if you couldn't tell. I wanted to pull a Bobby Knight and throw my chair onto the court. What a pile.  And then after the game I acted like a jerk; I blew people off and stuff thinking that I was cool. The person who just helped me out told me good game, and I was so pissed I didn't even respond. I feel like a total idiot. A big apology to that person.  But after the game, about 10 guys came to my house for my party. It was alright, we just relaxed and played video games and watched TV.......crap like that. My parents weren't there, which was pretty cool....we got to stay up as late as we wanted without them nagging at us.  Today was alright. Practice was the same as always....I didn't say anything about the game last night; I still don't want to think about it. What a waste of 2 hours. Bleh. After practice we went to Amore's and listened to more of Devin's extremely perverted fantasies, haha. Good times. I didn't do anything tonight really except go CD shopping because everyone was either gone or really tired from staying up late at my house the night before.  We have Monday off, but we might as well be going to freaking school, because practice is at 8 AM. WooHoo! I'm gonna spend 2 hours of my time so I can earn a spot for my butt at the end of that bench. Sweet.  At least there is tomorrow to rest........

       God, today was just one of the worst days I've been through in recent memory.  It started out okay enough; we didn't do anything in comp sci..but who am I kidding, we never do anything. In history, I was told that I didn't turn in 2 chapter outlines......so there's a good 3 hours of homework for tonight.  Then I get to English, and Doug gets caught "cheating", copying off my paper. Alright, I'm not gonna defend myself, I admit it was wrong, but I have a little bit of a problem when certain nameless people SKIP CLASS TO FINISH HOMEWORK! Seriously, does anybody find something wrong with a parent taking their kid out of class so their work won't be late? Oh and also, THIS "CHEATING" STUFF HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. In Ms Bowen's class! But somehow me and Doug get caught instead of the 20 girls who have some kind of freaking underground railroad when it comes to giving each other answers...what a pile. Oh yeah, she threatened that we would have to go see Potts........uh-oh, you don't say!!?! Let me start my one-page apology to God now so I'll have "learned my lesson" beforehand.  And then practice just sucked, again. Coach talked to me about going back to JV....now there's a confidence-booster for ya. Whew, now I'm really psyched to play against Lake Country! The hell is that?!?!  Oh, and the icing on the damn cake.....I have to wake up at 5:15 ON MY BIRTHDAY to go to basketball practice. I am seriously about to punch a hole in the wall. God this sucks.  Ah well......see you guys and school bright and early.  EDIT: Ah, I did find something good about today......made a 198 on the pSAT. Good for the 95th percentile. Now, I have to wait for the NMSC to see what I'm going to get, but hopefully I will at least get something...I did about as good as I thought I could do; hopefully it will pay off in the form of  $$$ for la universidad (that's college in Spanish for those who are less educated than me).  DOUBLE EDIT: And just to top it off, Carolina loses......Note To Self: As tempting as it may seem, DO NOT beat your face in with a heavy, blunt object.

       We lost the game. In overtime. After we had a 5-point lead at halftime.  I played a grand total of 7 minutes.  I hit a 3-pointer in overtime. Props to me, Carmelo-style. "Finally, I would just like to thank myself........"  We choked like a hooker performing for a black man. 1-point lead with a minute to go, and we turn the ball over 3 times. It was pretty unbelievable.  So right now, the best word to describe me would be......."F**KING PISSED OFF." Oops, that's 3 words. My apologies.  Before I say anything I'll regret I'm leaving. G'night.

       Today was....weird, I guess. I was pretty much not there. I don't remember anything that happened, really. Just zoned with my CD player that I hid inside the hood of my sweater, and thought about stuff......the game tomorrow, the party at my house Friday night (which my parents said they would go somewhere else for! How awesome is that?!?! I got the bong, and I know I can depend on you wild Faith party people to bring the keg....), stuff like that.  Basketball practice was terrible. It seemed like it would never end, and we were in one gym with both of the other team so it was chaos a lot of the time. Bleh. We got home at 6. And what's worse, we ran freaking sprints. Now I don't like to second-guess, but I would probably like to be fresh for the BIGGEST GAME OF THE YEAR. I felt like I was gonna throw up but I couldn't. Wasn't really tired, just had some stomach cramps like a sumbitch.  Janelle wasn't at school today....that kinda sucked. Her little bro keeps asking me how she is.......haha. Love you Austin. You're my favorite freshman (sorry Hazlewood).  Well we play Harvest tomorrow. Doesn't get any bigger or better than this. That's what they say, at least. I'm sitting here the day before and I've never been more nervous. The last time we played them, in a tournament which didn't count for district, I didn't score and I freaking blew. We had a 14-0 lead in the 1st and ended up losing by 10.  I just hope everyone's there mentally tomorrow. I think we will be fine, but Harvest has a few athletes and they will challenge us. Just comes down to rebounds (they outrebounded us by about 40 last game) and execution on offense.  G'night......another unbelievably boring day of school awaits. Boo for school, hooray for basketball....sort of.

       Today was great. Went to church, went home to eat, then went back to Kody's to pick up some stuff I left over there. Then I went to Wherehouse Music to do a little shopping. Normally that place is really freakin' expensive, but I found a 3CD box set of Jimi Hendrix for $19! I also got Dashboard's newest CD.......it's amaaaaaaaaazing. (thanks Becka)  On the way back I had to stop somewhere to get a card for my dad's b-day, so I'm driving down Harwood and I find a Hallmark. I go in and someone behind me says my name. It was Janelle! I came to her work without even knowing it! How weird is that?!?!?! She told me she works at Hallmark but I thought it was the one on Glade. So I bought something and then we talked for I guess 5 minutes and then I left. That was cool.   Anyways, tonight I haven't done crap really. I wish I could do homework but I just don't have any desire to whatsoever. And I have a feeling that I'm going to stay up past 12 again so I'll be real tired.....but it's not like we have to learn anything at Faith! I mean honestly, how can you take a high school that has SNACK TIME seriously?  G'night......  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, my birthday is in 4, almost 3, days......January 15. I'm sure no one neither knows nor cares all to much, but hey, I have to announce the date of my escape from the womb.   Right Now I'm Listening To...

       Well, tonight looked like it was going to be boring as hell. I checked around and everyone was either already doing something or didn't want to do anything at all. So I went to Kody's house, and we called Devin to see if he wanted to do sumthin. His dad is the pastor at a church with an indoor basketball court, so we got two teams of 4 together and just played.  It was really relaxing, actually. I went into it thinking that I was just going to get even more tired of basketball, but it ended up really fun. Lots of funny crap (Devin getting owned by Kody was freaking hilarious! Sorry Devin).  I got home at about 12:15 and just sat around talking to people and listening to music. I don't know what it is about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but listening to them can really change my mood about things. I'm not stressing over prom or girls as bad and I have my priorities straighter. I wish I could just ask her and get it over with, though....  It's still crazy for me to think that I am out of high school in 17 months. How crazy is that?!?!!?!  Church is tomorrow.....that should be good. I get to see everyone I didn't have a chance to talk with over the weekend and we're starting something on evolution. Should be interesting.  School on Monday....and a freaking 2 1/2 hour basketball practice, on the day before our biggest game of the year. I'm not despising Monday with all my might, though, because it's just another chance to socialize......our school isn't about education at all, which is definitely a good thing.  Oh, and a side note...........MY BIRTHDAY IS IN FOUR, YES, FOUR DAYS. My mom keeps asking me what I want to do for it, but I haven't celebrated my birthday in so long that I don't know what to do. My birthday just seems like another day to me. No special reason for me to celebrate it, really. It was the day I was born, so what? Should I celebrate not dying? Just seems weird for me. Maybe it's a parent thing.  G'night y'all.......see most of you in the morning or on Monday. Have a great rest of the weekend.

       Yeah since we won last night, somebody figured that we needed more practice, so that's what we did....oh man, it was great. Exhilirating. You know what? It was too good for any adjectives.  Seriously, it was pretty frustrating. Me and Ryan, the other PG on the team, were assigned to be the "coaches" during our scrimmage....we called the plays for our team and were supposed to be enoucouraging. Well I can safely say that I am not the best encourager in the world, so I'm not really cut out for what I was doing. Anyway, my team was down by 9 when I switched with Ryan, and then we got to a point where the team I WAS on was down by like 17. They came back at the end, with the help of the scorekeeper, aka our coach. Good times.  My hamstring still hurts. Everytime I take a long stride, I get kind of a sharp pain. It's nothing big, just a strain, but I figured it would go away by now since it happened on Tuesday.  Well I'm still thinking about prom and I'm just as confused as I ever was. In a perfect world I would ask this girl and she would say yes. We talk at school (not as much as we did last year, though, which kinda sucks) and she is really cool. She never seems to be sad or mad about anything. But the problem: she is a senior and I heard that a senior guy was going to ask her so I don't think that is going to work. People keep telling me to ask this girl that I talk to a lot at school, but we are just friends who are goofy around each other. That'd just be kinda weird for me.  Well I'm off to my friend Kody's house for the night.......have an awesome Saturday night.

       The day started off just beautifully with a dentist appointment, bright and early at 8:15 in the morning. Can't tell how excited I was to be there. So anyways, I'm supposed to get a permanent crown put on one of my back teeth, and guess what, something's wrong. So after an hour, I take another impression and, thank you Lord, I have to come back again!! I'm counting the days until I get to go back!  So I kinda "skipped" class (skipped is such a harsh word; I prefer "chose not to attend") for an hour and a half, just kinda sleeping.....I have been awake at 12 AM every night this week. I dunno what it is; I just want to talk to people I guess. Meeting people you should have gotten to know a long time ago is awesome, but it makes you regret all that time you spent in the extremely awkward "I want to say hi to them but I don't know if they will say it back or not" stage. Not sure if they feel the same way, but hey, they talk to so it's all gravy.  Today at school was really relaxed; we didn't really do anything important......and then our basketball game. I don't know what our deal is, seriously. Maybe it's Coach Reich subbing us in and out every 30 seconds, maybe it's the fact that we just don't hang out with each other off the court...I don't know, but we suck at talking to each other and playing as a unit. I hate it, too, because we are the most talented team in our district, but we almost choked up a game to the worst team, Bethesda. We ended up winning by 19 or so; I played a grand total of 9, count 'em, NINE, minutes. I got subbed out on two different occasions in the 4th quarter and I didn't even start that quarter!  After that we played a 7-person game of Halo for the X-Box at my friend's house, who also plays on our team. Yeah, it may sound extra geeky, but we do it ALL THE TIME. It's really a lot of fun, with the right amount of people. I don't get into it as much as some of the other guys, but I am pretty competitive so the game can just piss me off sometimes. How many times do you have to shoot the SOB in the head before he dies?!?!?!?!?!  This weekend......I really don't know what I'm going to do, and I don't care. There has been a lot of stuff going on lately, and have freaking basketball practice at 10 AM, so I won't be in any mood to go mess around until tomorrow night. Sometimes I wish our school was more united. I know every school has it's cliques, and I am guilty of hanging out with the same people all the time to, but we need leaders at our school. People who aren't afraid to spend a weekend night with an underclassman, people who care about others enough to talk about their problems with them, stuff like that. Instead, we all go our separate ways and only meet up for basketball practice...  Well I guess that's it. I hope everyone has a great weekend.

       Man, senioritis already has a grip on me, and I'm not even done with my junior year. I just have absolutely no desire or motivation to finish out high school.  But I'm sure that's fairly common when one has to wake up at 5:15 IN THE MORNING to go to school. Yup, the dreaded 6 AM basketball practices......the whole thing is wearing on me. I am almost counting down the days until the season is over, especially since we make so many mistakes as a team.......we don't have any chemistry. Everyone who watches us knows that. Even the girls team is more united than we are (and they are awesome, by the way)....no offense, but girls are the ones who are supposed to be fighting with each other. That's just how it's supposed to be. Oh well.....  I guess I should finish the background info.......I am single. A swingin' bachelor, if I do say so myself. Not really. I haven't had a girlfriend in almost a year now, which isn't a bad thing, but prom is in a few months and I have no idea what I'm going to do.  The girls at Faith.......I really don't know what to say about them. There are those who are just really cool to talk to, and then there are those who would rather talk about themselves all day. Maybe it's because a lot of them care about studying more than anything else........Good Lord, why waste your time worrying about daily grades?? Honestly, there are some at our school who work for 4 hours a night.....this is high school! Go out and have some fun! They say they are preparing for college, but most of them don't realize that they will have to LEARN the material instead of puking it up onto their paper.  2 days in a row....man I'm good....

        What Up World?   Well, I really didn't feel like writing stuff down on paper, so I figure that blogging my thoughts will be a learning experience, for me and everyone who reads it.  Background info:  - My name is Brian Smith  - I'm a  Tex  an   - I'm 16 years old, will be 17 in eight days  - I am the shortest kid in my grade, maybe even in my high school.......yup, all 5 feet and 4 inches of me.  - I'm a junior at good ol'  urlLink Faith Christian School ....I'll mention FCS and it's oddities many times here.  - I play football and basketball, and am not paticularly good at either.  - I enjoy all kinds of music; you name it, chances are all like it.......everything but country. My favorite band BY FAR is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 20 years and still going strong.  Alright, that's me.......there are a lot of things going on in my life right now. Basketball, problems/issues with friends, meeting new people, deciding what college to go to, getting ready for my senior year, pimpin' h...wait, nevermind.....  I guess I could make a New Year's Resolution to update this bad boy every day....but that would require some work. We'll see.....     Right Now I'm Listening To....

       Friday was pretty darn eventful, mainly b/c of what happened in the afternoon. I was supposed to be at John's house at 4:45 so his parents would give me a ride to the girls' bball game in Waxahachie. Needless to say, I showed up at........4:46. To add to that, my phone was dead, and I couldn't check my messages. But I didn't panic. Instead, I headed back home, got directions from Mapquest, got the car phone charger, and headed off.....to a place a freakin' hour away to watch a GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL GAME. Yeah, I felt really cool.  So anyways, it was a pretty long ride.....note to self: Don't get on 360 during Friday rush hour. But after 360 it was pretty smooth sailing...I made it right as the 2nd quarter started. Well, after what felt about half a day later, the girls finally won in 2OT on a 3 at the buzzer........it was nice. So, they're going to state....and we're not. And hearing about how they're going to state every 10 seconds is getting just the smallest bit irritating. But they deserve the compliments, and we don't.  After I got home, I went to Kody's and spent the night.....we stayed up till about 2:30 watching Family Guy. What a genious show. I laughed pretty much the entire time. Can't wait till the movie.  Saturday was pretty cool, we went up to school for praise and worship which was really good. It was just a time to get away from everything and focus on God, and I think everybody there really needed it. Just another thing to help out.  Alright Sunday.......man that was a pretty rough 24 hours. Church was fine, but I went to Sonic and tried to call Janelle at least 4 times....I sometimes bring stuff to her work for her, no big deal. But she wouldn't answer today. I figured that it was cool; she usually leaves her phone on silent at work anyways. But after that and the fact that she didn't respond to 3 text messages I sent hera earlier this weekend, I figured I'd better try to talk to her. So I asked her if she had heard anything about me, and she said "sort of". Then I said "So I guess that's why you never answer when I call? What have you heard?" Then I got an excuse about being bad at answering her phone, and after that, "I heard you liked me and I didn't want to lead you on". Ouch. After that, I got the dreaded friends thing........I tried to be as nice as I could and I guess things are okay now; it's just really awkward though. I mean you can't just give up liking someone on command.......so now I'm stuck with nothing I can do. Oh well, I'll get over it......  So I'm a bit down in the dumps right now.......but I've got a lot to be happy for. Especially the fact that I own a pair of those rainbow-colored socks with the individual toe holes.

       Well, this week has been pretty good.......it was SOW this week, basically a 3-day retreat while still at school. A guy spoke to us named Mark Cahill, he had some interesting insight.....and man this guy had a ton of stories about sharing the Gospels to other people. It was a great 'wake-up' call to the whole school I thought, because even though we all strive to "walk the walk", we really haven't cared about others enough to help them come to God......  I'm fearing another one of those "spiritual highs", though. Last night, our homework assignment was to share the Gospel with just one person.......and a lot of people did it, which obviously is awesome. But that's just one night out of 365.....what's gonna happen after a full week of school next week? Are people really going to make time to go witness? Are people really going to care enough?   It's time for us to realize that we can't just get up for God when we're forced by the school to spend time with Him.......having things like SOW is great, but what would Faith be like if everyone lived out their walk everyday? Would we have all the gossip, hatred, envy, etc etc et that we have now? Definitely not.....I know that I'm guilty of delibrately disobeying the rules, and I'm speaking to myself and everyone else here.....but the feeling we got today CAN last a while, if people would stick with it. Unfortunately, most of us are just too "busy" to do that.....  And another thing is, I think sharing requires a deep knowledge of the Bible....and almost nobody at our school has studied it well enough to get into a logical debate about religion or philosophy. It's sad, really, because we have a class specifically devoted to Bible, yet that's the only 50 minutes of the day that most of us spend digging through it.....and even then most of us react by treating it as busy work....we never really bother to interpret it to our own lives. So what happens when you're talking with a Muslim, or a Baha'i, or a Mormon, and they want to specifically know more about your God or Jesus or the Bible's prophecy......"I don't know" isn't an acceptable answer to them. It just worries me that so many people have inherited 100% of their parents' political and social beliefs, so they could always do the same for religion.....  This week has also kinda sucked because of the lack of basketball. I even almost miss practicing now. Sigh...there's always next year, I guess.  Plus I'm still looking for a girl who I can just sit around and talk to.....I don't even need a girlfriend or anything like that, just someone who isn't afraid to be known as my close friend. I thought I had found someone like that, but the whole clique thing has gotten so much in the way that I don't really feel comfortable talking to them around other people.  On a related note........*clap, clap, clap clap clap, clap clap clap clap* DOG SHOW!

       WAS INCREDIBLE!!! Never been a better one in my high school life.  It started off great......well, kinda great. I woke up knowing we had no basketball practice. Kind of a good thing, kind of a bad thing, knowing that all the practices and sprints and drills are over, but yet we now only have one more chance to leave our mark as State champs. I want it to be November '04 so bad now.....can't wait till next season. But I don't really have any regrets about this year, because this season was all about sitting back and taking it in for me......next year is my time. I hope.  But my mom decided to wake me up at 8:30 anyways....to tell me it was snowing. That was awesome. We got a good 4-5 inches here, which really surprised me. So B-Rad called me and about 4 of us went to his house to mess around. Then we went to eat lunch and I left to go get "someone" something for Valentine's Day.  I got a big white bear and some chocolate.........nothing really over the top, but it was nice enough, I thought. Problem was, the girls' game was at 6, and then they all had to watch kids to raise money for their senior trip. So that left me with exactly no time to give this stuff to her!  We went to the game, then about 4 people went back to my house afterwards to watch the NBA All-Star Stuff. Let me be the first to say......Chris Andersen got jobbed. His dunk was so much better than Freddie Jones' 1st one! It's all about hatin on the white guy........  So after we played a couple games of College Hoops, they left...it was about 11 then....I knew the girls would be up at the school till 12, so I really had to haul butt up there.......and I did. I got more and more nervous as I got closer, but I knew there wasn't any going back. I wanted to make it a bit of a surprise, so I put the stuff on the hood of her car along with just a short note........and prayed that it wouldn't get stolen by the Mexicans, heh.  Whaddaya know, about 20 minutes later.......I get a call. It was wonderful, she loved it and thanked me for it. It felt great knowing that I made someone's day better (even though they didn't need it to be; they beat Pantego up, way to go girls) and it was even better that she actually called me to say thanks! We talked for like 5 minutes before we said bye.....it was really cool. Made me feel great. I'm so happy.  Well that's about it.........off-season starts Tuesday. Can't wait. My pants are going crazy already.   Right Now I'm Listening To...

       You know what, I give up. Figuring out what I feel is hard enough, but to try and feel what someone else is feeling.....it doesn't work. I don't know what to do, and even if I did I wouldn't know how to go about doing it.  I wish I could make feelings like this go away but I can't, so I guess things will just be awkward until I learn that I'm just not her kind of person.....why did this have to happen so close to Valentine's Day?!?!?!!?  At first I backed off on what I posted here Saturday night, but now I'm starting to believe it again....I just wish there was some way to know whether I'm wasting my time or not. Oh well.....just try to forget about it I guess.  Ugh, anyways.......today was fun. I went to a grand total of 2 classes, because we got to pass out Valentine's Day stuff. Just another reminder of how lonely I really am. But at least it was a break from the everyday grind of school. I stayed up till around 3 last night, finishing stupid papers. Ugh, I hate how teachers think it's cool to put everything off till the last minute, then lecture us about procrastination. Seems a bit hypocritical......  Tomorrow is the big game. Faith @ Southwest, regional championship on the line. 7 PM, Friday. Whoever loses goes home. Should be great.......unless the roads ice over like the weather people are saying. Then getting back will be pure hell. Pray that it doesn't happen!  Valentine's Day.....woohoo, should be fantastic. The girls are playing @ Pantego at 6.......go support them.  That's about it I guess. Sorry for the dull mood.

       Sorry guys, these past few weeks have been ridiculously busy........school, basketball playoffs, yall know the drill. Guess I should just start fresh.  Today was a landmark day for our school: The guys won a playoff game for the first time in the school's history! Yeeeeeeeah..........we beat Amarillo San Jacinto by 13......54-41 I believe. Don't remember the exact score. Praise God, I actually got onto the floor. I surprised myself by not having a single turnover, but I wasn't shocked when my only 3-pointer sailed over the rim. Go me.  The girls also won. They beat Midland Trinity by 11 I think.........great job yall.  Tonight, I went to Barnes & Noble, then a few of us went to my house to watch American Wedding......it would've completely sucked without Stifler. But with him, it was pretty damn funny.  And today pretty much sealed my fate as far as prom goes..........I don't think I'm going. I left this person a message, and by some miracle it actually got returned.....but there was just no interest; I could tell when her last words were "See you Monday, I guess." Yeah, it's kinda rough, but it's nothing she did....she just tried to be nice to me and I took it as something more. When she backed off, I tried harder to make it work and only screwed things up. So it's my fault. People tell me that I can always find someone else, but this just seems different.......for the past few weeks, she's been almost all I could think about; I don't even think she remembers my name sometimes. The whole ordeal is worthless now. But I tried, I guess.  I don't know what it is with me; I always try to force things in relationships. I'm so impatient that it's no wonder I haven't had a serious girlfriend since the summer after freshman year. Sometimes I try to force things just because I know the girl isn't the purest person on the planet, but this situation wasn't anything like that.......I looked at the situation, and once I heard some stuff that she said LAST YEAR, I made things out to be more serious than they really were. And I forced stuff. I tried calling so many times, that I should have figured out by tonight what was going on. She was trying to give me some signs, but I was to stubborn to read them.  So now I'm sitting listening to Incubus.........and it's incredible, I've never read the lyrics of a song that match up better to what I'm feeling right now.......it's off Morning View; called  "Blood On the Ground":    I don't want to talk to you anymore I'm afraid of what I might say I bite my tongue everytime you come around Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground  Hand over my heart I swear I've tried everything I could Within all my power two weeks and one hour I slaved and now I've got nothing to show Oh if only you'd grow taller than a brick wall  From now on I'm gonna start holding my breath When you come around and you flex that fake grin Cause something inside of me has said more than twice That breathing less air beats breathing you at all

       Holy crap it has been a long time since I posted in this sucker....alright I'm extremely bored so I guess I'll start again.....  In this past 3 weeks I've gone through a heck of a lot and I've been growing closer to certain people than I ever thought I would. It's made me stay up past 12 almost every night, but I really wouldn't have it any other way. The only thing is that I've had a pretty hard time keeping up with my schoolwork, but it's not that huge a deal to me. God has really blessed me with some great friendships that I am really thankful for. Life is good, no matter what my circumstances may be at any given moment.  I decided that I'm going to fish on Lake Whitney instead of going to prom. Yeah, going fishing instead of going to prom may seem a little trashy/dumb, but you know what, I'd rather be on a lake hangin with my cousin instead of at some country club trying to avoid all different types of awkwardness. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I hate prom or the people that are going to it; it's just that I'd rather not spend this next month stressed out over it.  Well Spring basketball is about to start up.......really pumped about that. It sucks that our tallest player won't be playing with us next year, but we gotta start now if we want to make up for losing him. If we get nothing else out of this I hope we learn to stop acting like a bunch of little girls when stuff doesn't go our way. Our chemistry sucked last year; it's what kept us back in a lot of games (most notably Harvest). This spring and summer will be huge for us and I really can't wait to start focusing on basketball again. I miss basketball season like crazy. Ah well, still got one more year.  Spring Break.....has been crazy so far. I've played basketball at 2 AM, been all over the Metroplex, and had a toilet overflow and it's remnants pour down onto my kitchen floor downstairs. It's been memorable to say the least. I'll give a more detailed update on that later.  Well I'm off......hope everyone enjoyed their Spring Break! Death Cab for Cutie at Tree's April 26! Be there or be a freakin' loser!

       Geez, sorry.....I am lazy. This one goes out to my adoring fans.....  This last month has been the most turbulent one of my life, no question. I've experienced so many different ups-and-downs, and even though sometimes I wish I were just void of emotion, I can honestly say I really don't regret anything. Maybe there's one thing I might change, but ya know it wasn't the right time or situation.....I messed it up. But this person has been nice enough to stick with me through all that's gone on and I love her for it.  Anyways.......yeah, life has been fairly busy. Prom activities were this weekend, so I asked Janelle to go with me, about 3 weeks before. She was really cool about everything and said yes which is nothing short of a blessing. I really didn't get to talk to her too much before prom, but that's okay. We both had a lot of stuff going on and our paths don't cross very much since she is almost never at school.....yup, I'm jealous.  So the day comes.......and oh my goodness.....we joked about Janelle being royalty but she looked so incredible.....literally like a princess. She was absolutely gorgeous. Put me and my gross hair and semi-gay tux (seriously, why did I choose the vest? That's gonna come back to haunt me when the pictures come in) to shame. Yeah....she was amazing. So we took pictures at my house for all of 5 minutes (haha we only posed twice), went to the Hubbard's and took a lot of pictures, and then went there. My mom let me borrow her Infiniti and that is a pimpin ride G.......fo rizzle.  Once we got there we kinda sat around and then ate....food was pretty good. Then dance time.......like I said, I got to dance with the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen, so how could that be bad? It was really cool.....although I am by no means a dancer, I had fun. It was definitely worth it. And to top it off, Janelle got prom queen....how cool is that? That's def something I can brag about when I'm a complete loser in college a couple years from now.  After the night was over (went to bed at 4, earlier than I had imagined), we got up bright and early to go to Lake Granbury.......and wow, that was a blast. They had 2 different houses, one for the guys and one for the girls......that was kinda self-explanatory but oh well. We stayed out on the lake most of the day and then ate and came back and watched Cheaper by the Dozen......dare I say, overrated? Oh well, it was cool.....extremely relaxing. We got back at about 1:30 today and I just passed out. As fun as the entire weekend was, it was also draining.  So that's where I'm at right now........very happy that everything turned out and that I got to go with Janelle. She is awesome! And I'm glad we're on the same page now; we finally established that we are better than everyone else and we can move on with life, haha. Good times......a 6 AM weightlifting appointment looms, so I better gaze into the mirror at my toned body and then get to bed. G'night everybody.

       Well I have absolutely no homework, hell I didn't even bring home my backpack, yet I'm still sitting here wide awake at close to midnight. I've gotten to the point where a lack of sleep really doesn't bother anymore; I can function just fine on just a few short ours of rest and I don't mind getting up early at all. I owe all of that mess to this year, my junior year of high school.  To say the least, this has been the most eventful 9 months of my life. I guess I will just start with the first half of this year and what I learned from it, since the second half is at least an entry or two all by itself.  I guess I should start with football. It was pretty interesting this year; definitely had it's ups and downs. Some of the ups......mostly involving meeting new people and the rush of Friday nights. I still haven't forgotten the one freaking pass that got thrown to me on varsity. I got 20 yards out of a 5-yard route and I didn't get the ball for the rest of the season? Grr.....   I got put on JV too this year, which I guess was a blessing and a curse. I liked it because I met all the freshman, and it amazes me how cool these guys are. I was definitely not as mature or likeable at that age as they are; couldn't ask for a cooler group of kids. But then I had to actually play with JV and compete with 15 year olds. That is okay, except for the fact that I know I shouldn't be out there. I ran down 3 different running backs from behind this year; I mean come on. JV games were still fun though, especially when we passed the ball...that was only 1 game but ya know.  Homecoming was fun, time spent hanging out after games was fun, all that junk was cool.....but then basketball started up and I couldn't have been happier. I can remember turning in my pads the day after our last football game and being so excited for basketball that I showed up to a JV 'scrimmage' that ended up being cancelled anyways, so I just watched them practice for an hour. I guess the first half of basketball was all about just finding our own identity, which we never really did at all. Instead we decided to focus on what other people were doing wrong, which came back to bite us later on down the road.  Of course there was the Harvest tournament.....memories of scoring 90 on Rockwall, and then coming back that night and getting beat 55-18...yeah, that's right, we scored a grand total of 18 points in a basketball game. We didn't score a single point in the 3rd quarter. It was so awful. Nothing like that had better happen to us this year; if it does we should cancel the damn season. And then we started a pretty lengthy losing streak.....which again, I hope doesn't happen this season. We have 8 seniors; how could we screw this up!?!?!  I guess school-wise...it was alright. To be honest I don't remember a ton, partially because I was so exhausted from getting up at 6 AM to lift every Monday and Wednesday. I remember the retreat, though. I liked it...a lot. But I don't think I got as high off it as most people did. Don't get me wrong, getting close to God is great, but if you're going to do it that way, you'd better keep that feeling with you when you go back to school. If you level off after just one week at school, you've just wasted 3 days of your life more or less. But I'm thankful that we got to experience it and I admire the way the seniors pulled it off on such short notice, especially with how often they are at each other's necks. I was surprised, to be honest.  I made new friends and experienced a lot of new things 1st semester....but that was nothing compared to the 2nd.....

       Today was alright, I guess you could call it the official 'beginning of the end'......the first day of the last full week of school. There were good and bad moments, but mostly 2 things had control over everything else:  1) The fact that we don't have to take another exam for AP English! Heeeeellllll yeah. Chalk that up on the list of things I would have completely failed because I didn't give a crap to study for them  2) The seniors are gone, a couple thousand miles away, and I don't really have anybody to talk to about stuff......and I haven't really had that since they left a couple weeks ago. I know they are busy with everything but feeling like you are being put off to the side really sucks.  Anyways......I find it really interesting how freaking stupid people act behind the wheel of a car. My anger is pointed mainly at females. I'm sorry but when did you have a kitchen and bathroom installed into your Beetle/Focus/whatever generic 'girly' car you drive? Seriously, it's like multitasking has become a competition where ladies fight it out to see who can do the most crap at once while trying to stay on the road. And most of them fail miserably at that, mind you.  And then there are guys....not very many I know, but just people I meet randomly at a light...who seriously must draw wood thinking about how awesome they are. I'll be putting down my sun protector thing and just glance over at the car next to me, and the way the guy looks at me makes me want to shove that layer of glass in front of him straight into his forehead. Seriously, what the hell is this, F&F3: Main Street Ridin', starring Billy Badass in his $500 Civic powered by Rice-a-Roni? Yikes, it is scary how seriously people take themselves......alright, rant off.  "Clowns really are very attractive people once they take their clothes off." - Devin Dean

       Alright I'm seriously going to try and update this beeotch more often, especially since I'll have a lot more free time with summer coming and what not.....mm, summer...I love that more than I love taffy, and I'm a man who loves his taffy...mmmmmm..mm.m! mmmmm....  Alright so today was the big state girls softball game and I talked my parents out of making me go to school, so me, John, Devin, Doug, and Brad all piled up in the ultra-manly Liberty and headed down to Waco. The ride down was great, lots of laughs and good times and what-not....but when we stopped to eat in Hillsboro we were informed that the field was flooded, and they were looking for another place to play. Don't ask how we didn't figure out that the field would be too wet, I mean we only ran into rain for over half the trip! Still better than school though....  So we decided to go down to Waco anyways in hopes that the game would still be somewhere in that vicinity. Boy were we wrong.....ended up being 45 minutes south of Waco. At that point we all lost any desire we once had to watch girls' high school softball and bailed. It was still fun and definitely worth it, since we didn't enter into a single classroom all day.  Doug and I did decide to go to football today, though, which also was pretty fun...football has a lot of down sides, but nothing beats getting on the field on Friday nights. At least that's what I've been told....  Today when I got home, I kinda wondered...what makes us that much different than any animal? Mainly I'm talking social relations, and how females are treated.....back a couple years ago, I saw a show on the Discovery Channel on an experiment that scientists performed on male and female chimps.....they were each given 4 chips: purple (grape), orange (orange, duh), red (apple), and the best, yellow (banana). They kept the males and females in the same environment for 2 weeks...and by the end of the 2 weeks, the females all had the banana chips...is this a coincidence? Of course not.  Why is it that guys have to do all the providing and pleasing in a relationship? Honestly, I understand that males are supposed to be the 'aggressors' or whatever, but how do we know when we've gone too far or when we haven't done enough. Girls say guys are hard to figure out....but do they have any idea how manipulative or secretive they can be? I mean when guys have an issue, they usually deal with it up front....girls will think of the most devastating revenge and go through whatever means possible to attain it. And sometimes girls really don't know what they can do to a guy. They send signs without meaning to. I hate this more than anything, because I have been burned by it more times than I care to remember. It just sucks.  Well that's all for me.....two fingaz like a playa PEACE

       That's right, the marathon that has been these last 12 years of school will end in 25 freaking days. That's it......just 25 days and I will be a senior. Top of the heap, BMOC, whatever. I have a lot of conflicting feelings about the end of this year. It's been a blur but it's also felt like forever since last summer. I want out of school so bad.....but then again I don't want to leave, I don't want the people who are graduating that I am close to forgetting about me and taking on a completely new identity.   Sometimes it seems like there's no such thing as life after high school......maybe that's because there isn't. There's no such thing as the life you are accustomed to anymore, at least. From now on YOU are responsible for everything you are involved in. You make the decisions, you run the show.   Why do people seem so ready to accept all of this? Are people really naive enough to believe that high school is the worst period of their lives? Seriously.....social pressures can suck but look at all your options....you can basically get away with whatever you want (unless it's extremely illegal) and you get off scot-free.  This summer will be all about facing reality for me.......people whom I've only begun to know yet I feel so extremely close to are leaving, for good. There's no coming back to high school; maybe that's a good thing but it almost feels tragic in a way. I'm glad they will be having the time of their lives off at wherever they may be, but this is the end of the line as far as a close relationship goes. I've got one more year and the last thing I want to do is waste it worrying about people who have moved on, but after these past few months I dread the thought of moving on myself.  The sucky thing is I know I did this all to myself.......everything that I will be experiencing at the beginning of next year is because I committed way too quick and didn't realize that there wasn't anything I could do to change the way people felt about me. It's going to suck in August when I look for that familiar face and realize she'll never be there again.....  Well having gotten that off my chest......life isn't too bad I guess. 3 more weeks plus an exam week and school is over with. Couldn't be happier about that. Football is supposed to start back up next week and I'm pretty excited. Don't know what the heck we will do next year, but at this point I know we don't really have anywhere to go but up. Plus get this......we are going to PASS *gasp* the ball next year! Unbelievable!  To be honest I'm a lot more excited about basketball.....I mean who wouldn't be? There will be 8 seniors on the team for sure, we're probably playing even more games, and we might be in 2 different leagues this summer...wow I really can't wait.  This weekend was........alright. Friday I didn't get to do jack because I had to take the SAT Saturday morning @ Grapevine. It went pretty good; I was confident but then again you can never really tell how you actually did on those things. That night.......I lost all masculinity and caved in to go see "13 Going on 30". Yeah, I know you're going to rag me for it....but in all honesty it wasn't horrible. Cheesy? Oh yeah....but not overly sappy. Plus, Jennifer Garner + lingerie + short skirts = sex.  This week I have the 2 most important tests in my life........AP History and English. Is it bad that I really don't care to study for either of them? Oh well.....what blows is that they are on BACK TO BACK DAYS! How gay is that?!? dklwetqauewoa'hiw432ohgi2;4eh.ajkgafd;oih'uy43i!#J%I!UT!  Hope y'all have a good week.....

       As you enter into conversations with people, try and pay attention to their body language, even more than what they actually say. Almost everyone, whether they like to admit or not, wants to be noticed and will subliminally try to garner your attention. I do it all the time, much more often than I like to admit. It's not wrong to want to be heard, though. People cast out signals about how they are feeling constantly, and our smarter/more perceptive friends catch them immediately. My question is this: Why do we try and hide what's going on in the first place? Are we really that naive to think that God doesn't know how messed up we are? There's a God with a direct line open just for you, every time of day. Sure, your friends will tell you, "You can call me anytime, I'm always here for you." You know, I haven't met one person who has been able to live up to that promise. It's an overused cliche, and one that I'm just tired of hearing. Still, we buy into it with all of our heart and when that person's not around, we're crushed. I personally have hit some rough sailing, and haven't had too many people to talk to about it, since everyone has been gone. The main thing is that I'm no longer a close friend of a person who I put so much stock in. I don't know what the deal is; they have been gone a lot, and when they've been here they've mainly been around one person. Maybe things have just been hectic; maybe I'm not what I used to be in their eyes...but why should I let that affect how I view myself or how the rest of my life is going? Once again, He's always there.....and it's not like you have to have your thoughts organized. Dump it all at His feet and you'll be surprised at how organized (and ultimately, insignificant) it comes out to be. And just because things are rough between you and someone who once was close, don't take it as a sign that things are over.  "A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity." -Proverbs 17:17~  Of course, if this person has no desire to lend you assistance when you're weak, then why attempt to make them? Some people are so wrapped up in their own situation that they constantly remain clueless as to what you're going through. Forget them before you try too hard and get too involved. IT IS NOT WORTH IT! no matter how strongly you feel about the person. Above all, hold no friendship above the one you have acquired with God. He treasures it more than anything else; He has His own Son's blood shed to spend the rest of time with you. You don't even have to pay a fraction of the price He did, and He doesn't have the human knack for letting people down. Let go and let God!

       I am constantly confounded as to why we continue to hold onto ideas or things for so long, even when we are clearly getting signs from God to stop before we self-destruct. It's like finding out for the first time that the stove in your kitchen is hot and your mom tells you NOT to touch it. Yet that just piques your curiousity even more. It's really amazing to me; I've done this so many times because I hold out hope for false ideals, assuming that 'if I want it bad enough, it will happen'. When am I ever going to let go and let God? He's always ready to help us discover the meaning behind our feelings, yet so often we try to understand them ourselves, without so much as even an outside perspective. What's the point of using one's own knowledge when at his disposal is the wisdom of the Creator of him and everything around Him?       The 2nd half of this year has been largely about understanding this whole concept for me. I have held on to something for SOOOOOOO stinkin' long, and because of a promise I made to her, I can't really even reveal anything about it. I guess it started after we played Notre Dame way up in Wichita Falls....I got home and took a chance, hoping I wouldn't be ridiculed for starting a conversation with her. Much to my surprise, things went really smoothly; I hadn't felt that way around somebody new in so long. Also to my surprise, it didn't just in there.       We talked just about every night this semester; I got closer to her in a quicker amount of time than any other person I've ever known. Everything was just so.....comfortable. I loved talking to her, no matter what time or what the subject was. One night I could tell something was wrong but she kinda skirted around the subject...then the next night I asked again and everything was spilt.  And my heart broke for her; I genuinely felt pain for what she had to endure and what she was still going through. And I let myself become totally wrapped up in the situation, which is just wrong. But it happened. And we kept talking. And I grew closer.       Then I committed the cardinal sin......I mistook what I meant to her. I was in over my head; Lord knows what I was thinking when I decided I really had feelings for her. Once again, just something I should've let go of at the outset instead of letting it fester inside of me. A lot of stuff happened to me and her during that time, which certainly didn't help the whole 'me letting go' thing. And then it happened.....I blew my cover. I revealed what had been bothering me for the last few weeks. And even though I KNEW what she would say and what she wanted, even though I KNEW what the consequences of it would be (almost all were negative), even though I KNEW that I would be shattered at hearing the words "I just don't feel that way about you," I proceeded. And I was destroyed when all I had predicted came true. I didn't sleep that night. Or the next. And from then on, most of the time when just the two of us hung out somewhere, the time I valued more than any other, pretty much stopped completely. Like I said, I knew the repercussions of my actions beforehand, yet I decided to do it anyways. So stinkin' foolish.      This happened in April, and I'm still in the middle of dealing with it. Still trying to understand why I did it, and why things have changed so much. Still wondering what I'm supposed to do to get my mind off her when I try and think of someone to call and have cheer me up. Because it won't ever be like that again. In two months I will be an afterthought to her. I exaggerated things and made it out to be more than it was supposed to, yet I never imagined I could be this devastated over someone I just met 5 months ago.      To that person: I know you'll never believe me when I tell you how much I treasure you. I'm sorry I had to harbor those feelings for you; I completely regret it because I knew all along it would end in heartbreak for me, but I proceeded anyways. And fell into a pit which I can't climb out of myself. This pain has engulfed me; I can't understand why I care about you so much but I love everything about you. You have served as an example for me in terms of Godliness and have been such an encouragement. I also know that you can't ever get as close to me as I want you to, and you wouldn't want that anyways. I hate the fact that I chose such an inconvenient time and that things never seem to work out as far as us spending time together goes. Maybe it's for the best, I don't know; leaving things in His hands is hard but maybe this is what He wants. Whatever happens, I won't forget ya and I'll never stop loving ya.  Sorry this post was so sappy/hard to understand. I'm not very good at this whole journal-writing thing.

       Holy crap, this past month has been pretty crazy. Consisted of.....  - Lots of staying in shape.  - Week long trip to Destin, FL....completely awesome.  - Winning the summer league bball tourney....with 7 guys total.  - Hanging out with anybody who's up for it...and for people who aren't, well I guess they're just kinda fading away.  It's amazing what happens when you take a step back and view your life from an unselfish perspective. Makes you realize how blessed you really are.  Hope all you guys are stayin safe and havin' fun.....one more month! People going off to college in the next month-6 weeks....keep up the awesome example you showed us this past year. We won't forget you guys.
