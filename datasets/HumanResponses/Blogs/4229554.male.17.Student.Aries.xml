      I am cureently babysitting my two year old little ister, and she's decidingto help me type. It's actually a lo of fun to whatch her, as long a I have a ecape when nap time comes around. SHe's sp hilarious, and just overly excited about everything, even for a two year old. . . Well I better get back to watching her...

        I hate the fact that I am so young. It's not that I wish to grow up it's just that I find it hard to relate to the other kids my own age. In fact, probably the only two relationships I have had with somone my own age, have been the least emotional...the least anything. They just never set flight, there was never any common ground on which to build a relationship. I spent a couple of hours last night with a few friends, they were having a Halo "battle" whitch is actually a lot of fun, but just the little things they got so bent out of shape over. Everyone entering was constantly getting yelled at because they were in the way, being to noisy, or doing other unimportant, yet ultimantly life threatening actions. I just didn't get it, they are so crude, perverse, and self loathing. I may hate my life from time to time, but that doesn't inspire me to tell a group of 20 or so fellow peers how empty I feel! I just wish that It was easier for me to just subscribe to their self imploding mentality. But I can't, I enjoy doing things they would never understand. Sure I still harbor many of the "Invincibility" ideals characteristic of a 17 year old, But I enjoy things kids my age have not opened their eyes too. I live in a world where puberty hits at a younger and younger age while the growth of the intelectual adult is crippled by the lack of outside stimuli and the rebelious close-minded. The saddest part in all of this is that those kids, adults, whoever they are, that I get a long with, are the only ones that will not look past the fact that I should be: young, naive, and without philisophcal reasoning. So here I am, a 17 year old who probably understands the world to an extent of most 30 year olds. It has to be the hardest thing to be mature past your time. I get upset at things such as dishonesty, betrayal, and have little conflict over other, trivial, adolecent problems. I just wish, that for one day, I didn't have to be so idealistic, I could close my eyes and get drunk, do drugs, fuck as many girls as possible...but then again, this is who I am, and if did come down to it, I wouldn't change it for the world.

      Never Thought I would see the day, When I was the only one who wanted to play, The day I'd takle the roads alone, Fight the fear of loneliness, With self-inflicted comforting,  I never hoped for such, I can never think of the word, I have never felt so much in need, So absent of the world, So lost and left to bleed,  Yet know that I know comfort, I seek it in everything I do, I look for it in places, where there is none, or could be some?  I never know the difference, I guess this is what alone must be! I feel so out of place, Each second, Ties into this eternity,   So should I call her, Should I give her a ring, OR shoudl I leave it up to her, Let her decide on what to bring...

      I slept so well last night, for the first time in forever it seems. I didn't wake up every five minutes with such horrible anxiety attacks, I was able to fall in and out of sleep, unafraid of tomorrow. I'm beginning to feel like me again, something I have been seriously afraid of for the past few days. I still awoke to thoughts of her again. My head is always filled with thoughts and contemplations over her. She is so beautiful, and I wonder if she realizes that! I am constantly struck with these visions of her picture perfect, freckled neck. Something I would seriously like to feel lying under my kisses.

      For the last few days I have felt so lost, so unable to socialize, and just feel relaxed. I can't remember the last time I slept really well. But today, I slept, I could eat, I cold feel almost calmed. Roz, If you ever read this I want you to know that you are so far the only person who has truly made me feel safe. I spend everyday lost, cold, and confused. Yet the moment I see you, I feel as though I might just figure things out. You help clear my head. And I guess that's why I spend so much time writing to and about you. That's why close to everyday, there is a new picture in my head of what I'd like to draw for you. You, and the thought of you makes me truly happy.

      Last night, I was in her company again, and it was so much better than being by myself. I feel as though now I am still no clearer on what her views of us are. But I feel that most of my feelings are one-sided, but then again, I have yet to stretch out that hand to see if she grabs it back. But what is she doesn't, what if she gets uncomfortable, then where will we be? I will be one friend shorter in my already completely diminished line of friendships. I remember I had it all planned out, she would let crystal leave and on her return I would ask her to "come lay with me"...But then again, what if she laughs? SHe already doesn't feel that interested in the notes I give her, she seems maybe...well, I'm really not sure. I just wish I knew, or had the passionate drive to find out.

      I told you I would write you today. Hope you didn't get home too late last night. It was a good time though. I hope you still plan on hanging out tonight. Like I told you earlier my e-mail is at my brother's store so I probably will only be able to write you on my days off from work, but hey even if it's only two days a week it's worth it right! I'm precious and you know it. Well see ya later !  Rozzie   Maybe I'm just reading too into it, but I hope not!!!!!

      Other Voices  Whisper your name in an empty roomY ou brush past my skin As soft as fur Taking hold I taste your scent Distant noises Other voices Pounding in my broken head Commit the sin Commit yourself And all the other voices said Change your mind You're always wrong Always wrong Come around at christmas I really have to see you Smile at me slyly Another festive compromise But I live with desertion And eight million people Distant noises Of other voices Pulsing in my swinging arms Caress the sound So many dead And all the other voices sing Change your mind You're always wrong

      I feel so excited, at the idea of a new chase, a feeling I have missed, and one that excites me so. It is so hard to not grab her, so hard to not confess: "I want To Place My Lips on Yours!" "I want you to touch me." "I want you to hold my hand." Are such things so horrendous to want, am I evil to want to feel her next to me. To slowly lay my lips upon her freckles and hear her breath change with each touch? She I fear, is the reason me and anna could not work. I fear such silly things sometimes, maybe this is nothing? I cannot tell, for I feel her looks, and I know her heart hears me. But the mind, the simple need to reason gets the best of her. I pray for a better tomorrow, one were I may understand this. This just feels so haunting, I constantly see images of her skin, each freckle, her neck...in fact it is far to much of a distraction...

        She sits there, quieted, Knowing that only happiness may linger, A stones throw away,  He sits there, I sit there, Knowing her heart hears me, But her mind will not let it go,  He, I, call to it, To let it go, I call to it through hidden lullibies and mental kisses,  Will she one day, Adorn me my kisses, and return them back?  He, the heart inside of me, Asks her only, For the return of such lullibies,
