      JKR has released the title of the 6th Harry Potter book yesterday. I signed up for HPANA yesterday to chat about it. So if you wanna know go to  urlLink Mugglenet  they tell you there. Well, I have a theory so read below if you want but If you don't then...don't.  In OotP Harry was talking to Dudly about beating people up. Here is some of the conversation. "So, who've you been beating up tonight?" Harry asked, his grin fading. "Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago-"... Yes, the Mark Evans everybody in the Harry Potter fandom knows about. JKR hasn't said if he has an important role in the books or not. If you go to  urlLink JKRowling.com  and got to FAQ, there is a poll to which question JKR should answer next. One of the choices if for her to answer if Mark Evans in an imporatnt character or not. Well, here comes my theory, if he is, he may be the Half Blood Prince. He shares the same last name as Lilly did before marrying James. He is also ten years old, which means in HBP he will turn eleven and that is when you get your Hogwarts letter. So, if this Mark Evans is an important character, and if he is a half blood, and if this Half Blood Prince is a person, Mark Evans may be it. Just a theory of mine. An opinion. Please comment about what you think of it.

      I don't think I've posted anything about Harry Potter!!!! How can that be??!! I love Harry Potter! Anyway, I saw PoA the first day it came out. I liked it, the effects were awesome but it could be a bit confusing for someone who hasn't read the book. There.

      I was chatting to my friends and we were talking about llama muffins...evil rampaging pizza eating llama muffins o_0, I was very creeped out, and I was the one who started the topic. I was going to make my own blogger layout but blogger seems to be much much smarter than me and I failed, woe is me. Anyway, I'm gonna go and try to tackle making a blogger layout. Bye bye now.

      Yup the moi would be meh! I want coffeh...*drool*...coffeh. I don't even like coffeh! Whats my problem? I had 2 hours of sleep, that would probably be it. I was watching cartoon network all last night so thats probably it. I watched a whole bunch of new Anime Seires I never seen before, I like most of them. Like Rave Master, I'm definatly going to that again. I'm staying up all might again cuz I have to go to a sleepover. Urggh! That means I can't be on the computer tonight! I would rather be on the computer than at a friends house any day.
