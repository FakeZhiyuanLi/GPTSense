Yesterday in irc aku tgh main game kat #mischeif. Aku nak letak away mode, sebab bak nenok Spore IdoL aleh2 kene disconnected. Terus tak leh masok net terus. Terus dalam kepala otak aku...~BAM!~ Aku orang dos aku. Aku mcm..Eh SIAL LAAAA. Haha~!     Im still thinking whether i made any enemies in the net...or maybe the person dos me for fun...kalau tk pon orang tu dos aku sebab da meman tk suke aku..maklomlah..ramai pon kata aku ni minah menybok kat dlm net jek~     Den aku plug of modem aku wait for a few hours den da bole masok arh.      Besok, aku kluar ngn Zaki. Dah janji nak tgk Catwoman. Tapi aku cham tk tau eh...cham bazir sak duit die. Kiwak aku pon pokai. Wargh~ Da bole rasa seh ekonomi kocek aku merosot sonce bapak aku da tukar tempat keje. Itu budak angkong arh. Buto aku nk carik die sak. Pasal die bapak aku kene buang keje.      Cerita die cham gini: Bapak aku keje kedai gunting pat Sunplaza. Behz tu sana semer pakcik  ROCK ROCK  punya. Bangsa tk sembahyang semer, tau nak minom bile nombo ekor jek. Kat situ bapak aku sorang je sembahyang, maklomlah..Ustaz la katekan. Behz tu one of the pakcik  ROCK ROCK  gi hire anak sedara die angkong siao tu untuk sapu kedai tu every time diroang nk tutup. Buto. Budak tu curi 600 ketul bapak aku yang kene tuduh. Sialan tol. Den kene buang arh. Gik pon bapak aku ckp atmosphere sana tk bagus arh. Minom..kaki judi..so might as well die pindah tempat lain. Baik2 kat Sembawang skrg bapak aku keje pat Pasir Ris. Kiwak jaoh sak ngn ruma. Haiz. Gaji pon agik kecik. Bapak aku da tua. Kesian siak...itu budak angkong kalau aku dpt...wuish..hepi sak..but anyway.. its over..     Kalau dulu mak aku kasi duit beli apa2 kau nak..skrg make-up aku dah kering pon tkde duit nk beli..ingat nk curik..tapi fikir2 balek tkde faedah aku jadi mcm dulu balek..curik curik anti kene tangkap masok kau dalam~! Ahakz. K lah geng. Tyme tu go arh dok. Pi SkoLA..HEHEH!!!!!!!!! CHaloZ~

        Sometimes i still cry. I dont know why actually. Sometimes its bcos i missed the times i had with Zul. Sometimes its bcos i love Zaki so much i kept thinking stupid thoughts that i wud lose him. Sometimes its bcos of the homework teacher gave me. Sometimes its just that i feel so down i just wanna cry. After that i will feel better. Gembeng siak Nora. Wahaha. Yesterday i saw a missed call in my handphone. It was Zul's number. I called him asked him what he wanted. He said he didnt call me.  LIAR . Haha. Den i wanted to put down the phone. I hate his voice. Den he asked me what i was doing. We talked like 2 mins n then i asked where he was frm. Frm meeting his girlfriend. Suddenly there's this sick fucking feeling in my stomach that hurts like chibai. Den i said i gtg. And i slammed the phone down. He den msg me saying he was sorri. SORri bout what. I dont undastand. He said he regretted.  CMON. PLEASE . Its over.  U have ur own fucking girlfriend . And i have my own boyfriend. Dont fuck around with me. If i think about it enuff, Zul is just like eric. Right? Dont u think so??? Haha. What an ass.  THey're both fucking assholes .  OK, i wanna go clean the house. Later goin out with my sayang. ChaLoz.

        Its been a sad day..a day where ive found out that Zul had never sincerely love me.. a day where i realise that one year with him was a huge waste, but also an experience.. a day where i would start a whole new life with Zaki.. this time i will not mess up...      If last time all my relationships were filled with lies, flings, scandals.. this relationship will a true sincere one. Ive also realised why Zul did this to me. Kalau kau main kan prasan org lain..lambat laun kau kene balek... its been such an experience that made me wake up.. and have my eyes open wide...breaking up with Zul was a blessing.. if not i wud have never meet Zaki...there is no guy greater than Zaki..and this time..im so sure that Zaki had love me for me and he loves me sincerely.. i am so so thankful..     Memang betol kalau kau doa dan sujud kepada tuhan dan mohon yang terbaik kau akan dpt apa yang kau ingin kan.And God has just shown me the right path to step on..     Am i being mushy?!?! HAHAHAH....forget the past... and start anew Nora!!! Yeah~!!!! Zul has no more existed and that empty space in my heart has been filled by Zaki...     Siak arh Nora!! Emo sak Kau!! haha!!.....Just cant help it... Aku ni bile part cinta2 aku emo sikit dok...aku ni gembeng...haha....Haiz...Zul...haiz...          Ok! pple back to reality! HAHHAHA! Sial La...selamat sak. Hari ni is the due date for the sketchbook module. Even though i was suppose to do 15 drawings and i onlie did 10.. i think i did pretty good...Alhamdullilah....And guess what??!! I got a fucking scholarship!!! WOOHOOO!!! $1200 here we come bebeh!!!

        Been reading pple's blogs. Its great to read about how other pple felt about different kind of stuff. There's love. There's school. There's parents. And so much more. Sometimes just reading them can change a person's way of thinking cos theyre so meaningful. Unlike mine. HAHAHAHAHAHA.      -=Back to Nora'z idiot mind=-
