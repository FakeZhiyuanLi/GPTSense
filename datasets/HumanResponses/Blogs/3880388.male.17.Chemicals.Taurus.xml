      FUCK! my parents decided to snoop through my room when i was at a friends house and they found my pipe and my tobacco, those fucking dickholes. im ragingly pissed right now and holding myself back from slitting their throats, but whateva, they can suck my shit. anyway, i had a pretty good day after all. i hung out with sam and eric and went to aarons house, they all smoked some dank that i got for them, but i didnt on account of the ua that ill probobly never get. i kinda wish i did now, since im going to get grounded anyway. but i gotta skate it up at least, since i never really get to skate in shittown cheney since theirs nothing to skate. some hot chick at aarons wanted me to stay the night and drink with her, i fucking should have, maybe i would have gotten laid. oh well, she was a cool chick though, so maybe ill get to see her again some time. i also heard some interesting stories about my little brother from nelson, him trying to sell ritalin and vikiden to jermy and aaron and asking jermey for pot a bunch of times, even though he doesnt smoke, hahah. man i hate my parents, at least i still have my tobacco. a cigarette sounds real good now. so... im out.
