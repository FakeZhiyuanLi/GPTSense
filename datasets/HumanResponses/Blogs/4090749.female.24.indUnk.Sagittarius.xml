      When I tell your Mama I don't like my calves, exclaim with your adorable 3-year-old voice, "Aunt Sarah, you have  real cows ?!?"  Insist that we walk in the rain because "you're like a plant and you need to be watered."  Hike 4 miles up a mountain with me even though you stayed up until 3:00 am the night before and you can barely keep your eyes open.  Say, "Hiiii Sarah" in your sweet 2-year-old voice every time I walk into the room, you walk into the room, or either one of us takes a breath.  Hug me in the cafeteria....right there in front of God and everyone.  Call me "Foundation Girl."  Tell me that you've found me a husband - one who will buy me a Volvo SUV, coach my future children's little league teams, and donate insane amounts of money to the university's foundation.  Call me "Dumpling."  Lick my feet with your yummy, purple, puppy tongue as you walk past me in the living room, in the kitchen, the dining room, the bedroom, the bathroom, the guest room....  Ask me to be your bridesmaid.  Still want me as your bridesmaid even after you ask what color dress I want and I list every color I most definitely do  not  want to wear, each of which happen to be one of your wedding colors.  Leave me a message at 3:00 in the morning because you're thinking about me.  When I tell you I've never been to Italy say, "I'll take you there someday."  When I've tickled you for what seems like an hour, read to you, colored pictures with you, swung you around the room, thrown you on various bouncy surfaces and I feel like I can't stand to be around you another second, say "I love you, Sarah!"  Offer to play Scrabble with me even though you hate it.  Take me to "Urine Town."  Inexplicably love my family.  Fly over from Vermont and spend the weekend at the beach, playing Skipbo  all day long .  Let me fall asleep on your couch 10 minutes after you get home even though you've been out of town and we haven't seen each other for 9 days.  Sit outside with me on chilly London evenings, watching the rats dig through our trash and planting little seeds within my heart....FTTL, don't count me out....  Talk to me with a Chinese accent ("Harro, Salah!").  Take me kayaking, even though you can't swim.  When I insist I can get us there with out driving on a single freeway, don't get mad at me when I get us so lost that my head spins.  Try Heffeweisen beer with lemon for the first time and  love  it.  Be genuinely curious as to why I would wash my hands with dishsoap, when I could walk to the bathroom and use handsoap.  Offer to drive me home in the middle of the work day because I have just wrecked my car and am so stiff I can barely move.  When I feel like crying my eyes out at work, take me to the old chapel, play the piano and sing to me until I calm down.  Watch  American Idol  with me every Tuesday, including the Tuesday of Lakers playoffs....and vote several times just to satisfy the  American Idol  obesession which brews in my being.  Have  Big Brother  all set up for me, so that when I leave my house during a commercial break and speed to yours, I don't miss a second of the entertainment.  Help me with my crossword puzzle.  Let me sit on your couch without talking. Sometimes, (OK, a good portion of the time) I just need to sit in silence.

      I didn't get the most perfect job in the world.  I came in second.   Before you start saying things like, "You're their second choice?  You should feel really good about that!" let me just remind you that second is not first.  Being second means that I will not be getting a $10,000 raise.  I will continue to pay Oregon taxes and commute to work on bumpy, pothole-filled roads in a car I cannot afford to care for.  I will not be (finally) getting my own place, paying off my student loans, or actually having enough money to get my hair cut more often than twice a year...   Second sucks.

      Wearing a thong to a massage session apparently gives the (male) massage therapist free and enthusiastic reign over my bottom end.  It also, apparently, causes the (male) massage therapist to chatter uncontrollably and ask inappropriate questions no strange man should ever ask about my bottom end.  Note to (male) massage therapist.....  Hands off, buddy.

      My mom doesn't believe in checking a carton of eggs to make sure none are broken before she buys them.  She thinks it's unethical.
