       >A November without Turkey  Dear Blog, This day is the last day of november. I started this blog on the 1st of november. So i would like to say thanx to the people that make this blog have a purpose like, Harry, Shelby, Jenny, and Sircomplainsalot. You are the only people that read this and if you dont....you should. You can here about the crazy antics that happen in my life during november of 2003. Such as...me and harrison having a party at midnight to celebrate the new day. Or Shelby liking 30 different people during the month (1 per day). And me.....Posting a blog. Only these are a few great things that happen on anime geek's blog. So i encourage you to not touch that back button becuz there is more to come. (this is not my last post!!!!!) Regards, Anime Geek  Ps. I've posted 24 posts so far

       >being bored again  Dear Blog, I downloaded 2 final fantasy music video's today. One of them was cool and has cut-scenes from ff11. I havent seen any of that game beacuse i cant afford it. You pay 50 bucks for the game and you have to scrape another 13 off every month to keep your account. And being 12 doesnt bring in any money. And the other video i got was a mix between 8 and 9 and had evanesence in the background (which is a nice touch). The video's will be availible on my site when i feel like it. I'm kicking myself for not finishing the video you may have to wait and dont rush me. I havent gotten any more pictures and my site wont make itself. It will be up before i die. Ok back to the movies i d/l-ed. I now understand why people call final fantasy 8's story "a make you cry story" even though is is just Rinoa letting go of a butterfly and there is that awesome evanesence in the background and us anime geeks are light-hearted.  It makes me envy squall because....well he...has...her. Geez my love life is horrible. (but programmers are lonely) BYE!!!

       >A Boring Thanksgiving  Dear Blog, I hate thanksgiving. I went to my grandparents house and barely ate anything. I was to busy trying to be unnoticed but it didnt work. They are all ADHD or at least one of them. There is not blood relation at all. Its my mom's step family that she has never been close to. I dont even know how annoying they are. I hate being around them because here I am a nerd wearing my nintendo shirt wishing to watch the XPLAY marathon. But they are all watching the football game and I couldnt care less. So I was bored and did not fit in (not like i wanted to) so i hope all you had a good turkeyday not like mine. live long and prosper \\//

       Dear blog.....again, I didnt waste alot of time today. Me and my dad went to fry's and bought parts for my computer. All i need now is a hard drive and a camera. Its amazing how confusing picking out parts for computers can be.  here's a list of the stuff so far::::: a case with neon lights that has no name, AMD Athlon XP cpu, CORSAR 256mb DDR RAM, K7N2 Delta Motherboard, Radeon 9000 graphics card, Inspire T2900 speakers (good deal), BTC 9001A RF Wireless keyboard and mouse, BTC dual digital storage combo (cd writer, dvd rom, and supports 7 memory cards), And finally 50 cd-r's from sony. The end.

       Dear blog, Life is boring. I have nothing to do and i hate wasting time. I need to start my science project. I have to advertize a product and nitrogen has to be incorporated into it. so im getting an old spray-paint can and making a label that says atmosphere in a can. Yeah exciting. There is nothing else to do today with my same boring life. I am still working on the game creation site. And I just sent a review into vizzed.com. Well I will keep you updated on this thing people call life. bye self therapy!

       Dear Blog, I just got back from two hours of driving, YAY! Its so exciting sitting down not being able to turn of the seat heater and you are about to explode. Yeah Its fun. Now I dont know what to do. I have decided to go with that $$$841 computer from ABLE ELECTRONICS. Its a better deal and i get more flexibility with it.  And im glad i found out that the dell i was going to get had a graphics card BUILT IN TO THE MOTHER BOARD! And thats not good. I have almost beat dbz budokai with my spare time. My movie and site are building themselves to perfection and all they need is patience. And you can be freakishly excited that the video will be released by this friday i will update you then and i will give you a link. From, Anime Geek

I have to make a game creator site which will be done first. I will keep you posted on whats happening and remember to look out for sites >>> in that direction.

       Dear inhabitants of this mortal world.    I have nothing to do......I bought dbz budokai for the gamecube and its pretty fun, i beat the story mode in 3 hours of gameplay. I need games for my gamecube becuz i only have 2 and one of them sucks. I need to get pikmin [thinks about having many plant friends to help him in world domination] yeah that would be fun. I posted a thread on the XPLAY message boards about Anime-related video games. I want to see how many nerds like me will respond. Go to the bottom of my blog and you will see a link to the techtv blog ring. You may want to check it out. Final Fantasy X-2 comes out on tuesday, but being poor really makes you wait for it to be less. Yeah I'm going to pull out weeds in my backyard and see if they help me in world domination. BYE!!!!

       Dear Fellow humans! Tech Tv's awesome show ANIME UNLEASHED has announced that there rpg will be completed around early febuary. Yeah...yesterday I saw harrison's (his blog in my links) new comp IT IS AWESOME he has a drive that supports like 6 kinds of memorycards now all you need is something that can read PS2 mem (that would  be awesome). I have to beat vegeta jr's adventure pretty soon beacuse i review games for the guy at vizzed videogames (also in my links). I will be sure to tell you how it is. I have to d/l more naruto at dbznetwork (on my links) and i have to join the techtv blog ring and me + harrison are going to make a geek blog ring.

       Yay i woke up early! i have time to do stuff! Well its 6:40 right now in texas and i have to go to school in umm an hour. So thats good. I have just sprung an interest in sprites (video game character graphics) i just made a thing where i can design them.....its called graph paper. Pixel art will probably keep me occupied at school. Its really fun! Today i will hopefully get started on my first drawing most likely to be Uchiha Sasuke from naruto.  Nothing else is interesting.......

       I just woke up. Now I have promised to tell you about the matrix. Its awesome. Ok im done you'll have to buy tickets yourself and i am not gonna get in trouble for giving out spoilers and ruining the movie experience. So I'm in tyler this morning and i have thought about some features to put on my website. There will be monthly polls, a shoutbox!, a sprite of the week, And a download of the moment. I am willing to take donations you can email me and we will work things out. The donations will be going torward features on the site, enough money for me to review a demo disc, or whatever. The donations will be highly appriciated and you can advertize on my site for a set amount of time. If you have anymore ideas tell me and be sure to tell all your friends about this blog we need more ppl to read this site and you do, tell me, the more support i have the better the site will be, but remember to read the rules before posting on my november 6th post.

       There's no way i can put this in normal words. Matrix Revolutions was THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! It has no comparison, and thats what we decided to do instead of going to the Football game.  Ok lets start from the begining....After harry left my house after my last post I left it up to his family to figure out what to do. He called me and we agreed to go see Matrix III. So we get our tickets with his season pass and his dad goes and gets seats. So when his mom is looking for our other friend (Ryan) we try to get in THEY WONT LET US we're freaking VIP'S and the faggot that was going to rip our tickets said we couldnt pass so we got his mom, and we were going to yell at him and probly say "cant you take a joke moron" because harry said he was 17. But their was a different ticket lady when we got back so we couldnt piss him off. Well the girl lets us pass and we get to the entrance to the screening and a guy stops us because harry's mom left to go look for ryan. So harry runs in and gets his dad, we buy popcorn and we finally get in at the preview for the last samurai. So im tired and i have other stuff to do so I'll will write about the movie tomorow after i see it again. Later.

       ok i know its been like 20 min from my last post but i thought i would just get it over with. Well BIG NEWS I've practically hacked the dbznetwork.net server there server only allows 15 downloads per person but i found a way to get past that. I use the URL's, they should have been smarter, but you dont even have to login if you go directly to the site because they only block the INDEX with passwords. So if you want to download the naruto eps for free, type in your browser window www.dbznetwork.net/downloads/download.php?naruto01 to get any other eps besides the first one change the last two characters to the number of the episode. so to get episode 34 you would type www.dbznetwork.net/downloads/download.php?naruto34 ok I'll post later. bye

And if you post stuff make it related to the subject im talking about! Well ill post again tonite because i really dont have anything to say except that my ramen is ready! check out this awesome episode site dbznetwork.net bye

       Hey, today i would like to say something.......  Peeing in your pants is like happiness, everyone can see it, but you are the only one who can feel the warmth.  ok i'm done. i just thought that was funny. Well i dont know what to write about. I didnt get any homework today so thats awesome. I've so far burnt 8 naruto cds with episodes on them. Yeah if you dont know Naruto is an anime with ninjas and stuff. I've been looking around the net and noticed that techtv's show "Anime Unleashed" is making an rpg, they have already taken in ideas for the first chapter but im definetely gonna help out on the second chapter. If you wanna give me ideas for MY!!! rpg send me an email, NOW SEND IN IDEAS (you will be given credit for making the game). I'm still tinkering around with html and still havent gotten a hang of it but dont worry my site will be up soon i know all of you have menacingly been waiting for it. I encourage you to comment on the entries. Oh and if you want to read another anime videogame geek blog check out morgan webb's blog she is a host on X-play (she reviews videogames) you can watch her on techtv and the URL is www.morganwebb.com. Now for my closing statement.....i have a problem with social activity involved with people that wear abercrombie (also know as the PREP). ........and if you are a jerk that actually cares what i wear you should leave. DNE EHT HAEY....mre (figure it out)

       hello...welcome to my bright and shiny blog. My friend steven told me to write about my non-virtual life. So i will tell you about my friends in todays episode. Lets start with Steven, he plays football (he's not a jock at all its more like an anger thing) he watches comedy central. You can say that he has a funny sense of humor but its all his funny is based on tv shows *no examples needed*. Ok moving on.....Harrison, he dives [in a pool] he is the only one among us who has the dvd collection of the first 2 seasons of family guy. He is in my gym class and he is the craziest of all of....these people....erm yeah. He is a fellow anime geek and is a fan off the greatest anime ever....Naruto. ummm ok next, Elliot he has problems....he doesnt have an off button is is the rich kid who plays magic the gathering and has issuses with spelling words backwards [hey y'know racecar spelled backwards is RAC-E-CAR] elliot isnt very imortant. more friend profiles coming soon.....The End. Umm the site will be up in a week (or so), samuraipanda5

       hello everyone, hopefully.....ppl are reading this. im planning on getting my site up on angelfire soon. well maybe not soon i dont even know html. But i promise it will be up before i die. The main focus of the site will be about downloading anime and manga stuff (and emulators). Although i probably will not upload the files from there so i will have links to other sites.  i will have news and junk about anime and video games and geek stuff. currently i am trying to find games to review because im the game reviewer for the rpgmaker 95 program at www.vizzed.com. im sorry i didnt post yesterday but no one reads this exciting and interesting blog. the comments are up and hopefully work. and if you have ideas for my rpg please email me at samuraipanda5@hotmail.com ,later

       >Another day  Dear blog, I am feeling a whole lot better now. A good nights rest did the job. I'm glad no one was harmed in the incedent and in the last post i was kind of over reacting. I found a place in tyler called "the arena" or something like that. They have lan partys and you can play video games there for 5$ bucks an hour. Kind of a rip off but well i could meet alot of people. There website is http://www.arenatyler.com/yabbse/index.php   I have been waiting to watch xplay all day but its on at 11 and i woke up before the first episodes this morning. I am pretty happy with my new tv I checked and its only 20 in but thats better than 16 or 10. I should go to a pawn shop and buy one of those small tv's so i can play games in the car. I could probably get it really cheap but the shops are closed tomorow because of sunday. I picked up an atari thing that you plug into the tv and you can play 10 games. I got it for my birthday a while back. And i havent touched it in a while. I am glad they didnt steal it. but you can get them at wal-mart for 20 bucks. well i am off to do stuff. or maybe not.  i am going anyway..........

       >Get a Job  Dear blog, It is 12 at night the day after christmas.  I actually enjoyed christmas this year, usually i dont get what i want and i never notice it. I am very thankful for getting a computer and other things. Today we drove to tyler made a few stops, but eventually got here. When we pulled up to the gate we saw that our door was open. Someone had got into our house and stole $1000 of power tools and all the other stuff of value around our house. It was not vandalized only our couch was messed up because they were probably looking for a remote. They stole my tv and my sega genesis which i had both worked hard for and were cherished naturally. I loved that tv and worked my ass off for it. And i mowed the yard twice for the genesis. I probably did more work than those vandals will ever do. I personally think it was the contractors that were putting a roof on our new garage. Those bastards. The county sherrif came over and uncovered nothing for 1 1/2 hours. He told us that we need a security system, supposedly we are getting one in the morning. I will become a prisoner in my own home not being able to get up at night for some water. I feel very violated and uncomforable today. I want to go home very bad and kill these child molesting teen agers who have ruined our christmas. Well at least nobody was killed or our house went up in flames. I am thankful for what i have and every single theiving teen should burn in a pit of their own blood for all the trouble and deppression they cause families. We bought a new tv for me and i guess it is more of a christmas then, its nice, 26" maybe. probably i wont get another genesis because the insurance has only paid for part of the tv. I'm fine though, I am going through minor deppression and anxiety right now because of this whole event. But at least all my family members and my dog are alive. You probably dont care because there are alot worse off then me. Aim-samuraipanda5 Yim-samuraipanda5 msn-samuraipanda5@hotmail.com

After that i waited in line for an hour and i got to see it. A word of warning first, it is really long. I crashed after the movie. There are huge battle scenes which is 1/3 of the movie and since it was opening day there was alot of useless clapping and stuff but it was fun to be around fanatics like me. It was simply heaven for me. I took 2 exams today that were not hard at all. Im really bored but i will find something to do. I feel like going to gamestop and getting viewtiful joe or something. Yeah i'm going to do that.

       >Random thoughts for your entertainment  Dear Blog, I have been playing on my computer forever. I have found some cool sites that you may want to check out.  http://www.romanm.ch/english/ascii-movies.htm That is a site where they have taken scenes from movies and made them into text frames. Its hard to explain just look at it. http://gothicsamurai3.proboards26.com That is my message board if you dont already know. I have been updating pages to my site so i havent had much time to play with blog. http://www.angelfire.com/droid/samuraipanda5/bio.html that is my autobiography i am making chapters and is one of the many projects on my list. I hope you check it out.  I just moved my comp into my room and it is very cozy in here. I have placed a plushie of luigi, an action figure of Payne and a hippo on top of my monitor. I am content with my life. I have just listened to my friend's cousin's band. They are really good. Not really my type but i dont know why these people arent famous. if you like screaming death music etc. Their name is Anybody's Fault. I dont know if they have a website or not. I also have downloaded Kazaa Lite wich is a hacked version of KMD but they ripped all of the spyware and ads out and i can download stuff while im gone and not have 400 popups wich has happened before. I hope your happy with the post because i have had a lot of work to do my blog is always a lower priority. There are more things to come if you are interested with my crazy finds on the net and my sites (look forward to the change)

       >Listening to bohemian rapsody  dear blog, I just got back from tyler...again. Friday night i attended the school dance witch is usually hell for me. But actually there were enough rebels to make it all worth while. We (meaning me, steven, brandon, and harry etc.) wrote down all the good songs for him to play. When he actually plays them, we start jumping up and down like jackasses and one of us usually gets slammed in the head. This time namely me. One guy from 8th grade threw a guy right in to the right side of my face, i fly 20 ft backwards. It hurt. But it got better. And then we did our usual we hate rap chant    when    he    played    rap. Really? does anyone ever listen to rap voluntarily? Then we did normal stuff until he played bohemian rapsody. That was fun. There were a mess of outcasts in the front. In the begining there is a slow part....then i gets good but after the slow part he switched the song. About 30 people ran up there and yelled at the dj. He steps back and hesitates to make a move. He was scared to death. then from the floor he changed it back and the goodness continued..     I am going to start my autobiography "My childhood sucked". I will give you the link later because i havent started. And i wont really  be done until i graduate. I will update it frequently.

First time i have ever stayed up 20 hours and hopefully it will be the last. We got donuts and then i left. After a hard night talking about abortion and why they brought out a quija board. I went home and slept. Until now.........4 o clock. I took some pictures that i will post on the net once they're developed. Charles and zach both had small power naps and the rest of us (including me) jwe're passing around the bottled caffine waiting to go home.

       >some stuff  I have read this article on go three times and it is kind of hard to understand. but it is a good story. I found it at the "gentle joseki" series at  urlLink gobase.org   And I recommend this "http://gobase.org/information/history/china" if you are interested in learning the origins of go   and here is the short story...   "Playing go" he said, "Playing go will not lead to anything, it will certainly not help your studies".   "How's that?" the girl opposite of the bespectacled man asked.   "Playing go is an addiction, the game is a drug, once you have experienced the touch of the stones, the smell of the wooden board, the thrill, you'll be hooked to it forever, maybe longer."   "No way! You can't be serious, professor. I know you're taking me for a ride. Treating me as if I were a freshman who doesn't know how to play, uh?"   The graying man took of his eyeglasses and allowed himself a smile, only just from the corners of his mouth. While rubbing the bridge of his nose he recalled how many times before he had warned youngsters just as the 19-year-old sophomore in front of him now, to no avail. Why would nobody believe him, why on earth did he even bother trying to warn these know-it-all kids? While putting back his glasses he bent from the waist and looked the comfortably seated brunette square in the eyes, "listen, how long have you been playing? Two, three weeks? Do you think you mastered the rules up to the point that you're able to get a glimpse of the infinite possibilities of the game?   "Sure, professor McLaren, no sweat, I still can't see what the fuss is all about, trying to capture stones of your opponent while not forgetting to look after your own stones, piece of cake"   "I take it then, that you're familiar with terms as "two eyes, a ko-fight, seki, and approach move?" the patient professor continued, "You also know that at the end of the game stones which cannot be saved anymore may be removed and counted as prisoners? You know that the dame points have to be filled in because otherwise counting the score might become confusing? You know all that and the other tens of small details necessary to master in order to be able to begin to comprehend what the game is all about?"   "Oh, so now you're trying to impress me with difficult sounding stuff, very impressive, professor? Oops, I've got to get going if I'm to make it to my Asian culture class. I still don't understand why you try to keep me from playing such a innocent game as go, you of all people must know that's an important part of South East Asian culture. Well, see you next week, professor, thanks for the tea, ciao"   Professor McLaren was alone again in his messy-in-an-organized-way office, Caren, as the name of his pupil was, Caren would fall for the temptations of go, there was no doubt in his mind, he'd seen it happening over and over again. Ignoring her so far successful study, ignoring her friends, her social live. Possibly she'd pick up a nasty habit too, smoking or something, while she'd spent the prime of her live sitting in front of a piece of wood, contemplating where to next put an oval piece of glass. Trying to beat the nerdy looking opponent often burdened with jam-jar like glasses and a bad complexion. McLaren sighed and knew that he had done what he could to keep the girl away from such a dark future, away from the game of go. Somehow realizing this made him feel sadder even. Resigned he slouched in the enormous chair at his desk and spoke the words to activate the computer at his desk "Hello Dave".   "Good day, professor McLaren, the usual I presume?" spoke the silky computer voice while a LCD screen was sliding out of the desk top and erected itself in front of the professor. "Let's see, where was I, oh, yes, installment 5."   He was glad the university had signed a contract with a local catv provider, the speed of the connection was way better than at his own place, which was, to be sure, out in the middle of nowhere. "Ah, here we are, thank you James". " 'Pleasure, Sir" McLaren's computer replied. "Let's see what we can pick-up here this time, a junky might as well enjoy himself" McLaren was muttering to himself while he started to read the web page on the jumbo-sized screen.   "Playing go" he said, "Playing go will..."

       >Go and the 'three games'  I have found this article on "Igo" or "go", Shogi (chess), and backgammon. It is really cool to read.  Go and the `Three Games' by William Pinckard   Games-playing is one of the oldest and most enduring human traits. Disparate pieces of evidence such as dice discovered at Sumer, game-boards depicted on Egyptian frescoes, Viking chess pieces, and ball parks constructed by ancient empires deep in the Andes link up directly with contemporary phenomena such as Saturday night poker games in Kansas City and the annual go title matches in Tokyo.  Games are undeniably a concomitant of civilization and even in their most primitive forms presuppose some degree of sophistication. Most of all, they require the ability to think in abstractions and to manipulate ideas in logical terms, thereby giving form to what is formless and creating small, recognizable patterns in the shadow of great mysteries.  From ancient times in Japan the so-called `Three Games' were backgammon, chess and go. Chess probably comes from India, backgammon from the Near or Middle East, and go from pre-Han China. Backgammon is a gambling game which, using dice, gives luck or chance the preponderant role. Chess in one of its earlier forms also used dice, but takes its present shape from the structure of a royal society and from war maneuvers. Go is the most abstract and `open' of the three; and with its freedom from complicated rules, its simplicity of form, its fluidity and spaciousness, it comes remarkably close to being an ideal mirror for reflecting basic processes of mentation.  Go is played with black and white `stones' all of exactly the same value, thus somewhat resembling the binary mathematics which is the basis of the computer. The stones are played onto the board and are left as they stand throughout the game, so that the game itself takes shape as a visible record of the thinking that went into it. About three hundred years ago an eminent Chinese monk came to Japan on a visit and was shown the diagram of a game of go which a master of that time had recently played. Without knowing anything of the game save the sketchy description they gave him at the time (this was after go had more or less died out in China), the monk studied the moves as shown on the record and after a few moments remarked with much admiration and respect that the player must have been a man who had become enlightened -- which was indeed the case. (It is interesting to note that this story is told on the one hand by go players to illustrate the quality of the game and on the other hand by Buddhists to show the acuity of the monk from China.)  The great 17th century Japanese playwright Chikamatsu, in a famous passage, compares the four quarters of the go board to the four seasons, the black and white stones to night and day, the 361 intersections of the board to the days of the year, and the center point on the board to the Pole Star. It would be easy to erect a tower of fanciful theory along these lines, but that would only obscure the obvious point. In this striking analogy Chikamatsu is describing a feeling of hugeness and all-inclusiveness -- the board conceived as a complete world system in potential form. The board and pieces can be thought of as limitless: any number of lines and an endless supply of stones to play with, the game itself being the life of the players. (In Chikamatsu's play a young man becomes old and grows a long beard while watching a single game.) Only because we are human and must put practical limits to our activities, do we use just a small part of the infinite board. But this field of nineteen by nineteen is large enough to contain everything we are able to put into it. The number of possible games playable on this board has been reckoned to be more than the number of molecules in the universe.  An anonymous go player has written: `The board is a mirror of the mind of the player as the moments pass. When a master studies the record of a game he can tell at what point greed overtook the pupil, when he became tired, when he fell into stupidity, and when the maid came by with the tea.'  Contrary to the opinion of many people, go has nothing to do with Buddhism. Because it is a valid system in itself, it offers nothing contradictory to other systems, but in fact go is an older inhabitant on this planet than is Buddhism. In China it became one of the Four Accomplishments, the others being poetry, painting and music. It reached Japan around the 6th century and for a long time remained the exclusive property of a leisured noble class. Then during the 16th century all this changed. The many great families and clans which had warred happily against each other for a thousand years were gradually brought under the hegemony of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It was during the subsequent period of the Tokugawa era (roughly from 1600 to 1868) that go, along with haiku, kendo, tea ceremony and so on, was most actively cultivated as a way of constructively channeling the mental energies of the people during the long years of peace. One formal word for go in Japanese is Kido. Ki is the old Chinese word for go, and -do is the Chinese word for Tao, which means Way -- or, more specifically, a Way to enlightenment.  All games channel mental energies, whether they lead to enlightenment or the reverse, but it is suggestive to consider the `Three Games' in their social context because then we can see how each of them reflects certain basic characteristics of a general or regional type.  Chess, for example, the great historical game of the West, involves monarchs, armies, slaughter, and the eventual destruction of one king by another. The game appears to be entirely directed along the lines of the great myths of the West from the Mahabharata to the Song of Roland -- the overthrow of a hero and the crowning of a new hero. The pieces, from king down to pawn (peon), give a picture of a heirarchical and pyramidal society with powers strictly defined and limited.  Backgammon, the favorite game of the Near and Middle East, is preoccupied with the question of Chance and Fate (Kismet). All play is governed by the roll of dice over which the player has no control whatever. The players are matched against each other, but each tries to capture a wave of luck and ride it to victory. The loser curses his misfortune and tries again, but the individual is helpless in the grip of superior forces.  Go, the game of ancient China and modern Japan (and now popular throughout the world), is unique in that every piece is of equal value and can be played anywhere on the board. The aim is not to destroy but to build territory. Single stones become groups, and groups become organic structures which live or die. A stone's power depends on its location and the moment. Over the entire board there occur transformations of growth and decay, movement and stasis, small defeats and temporary victories. The stronger player is the teacher, the weaker is the learner, and even today the polite way to ask for a game is to say `Please teach me.'  Things are different now, but in earlier times, when go was so much admired by painters and poets, generals and monks, the point of the game was not so much for one player to overcome another but for both to engage in a kind of cooperative dialogue (`hand conversation', they used to call it) with the aim of overcoming a common enemy. The common enemy was, of course, as it always is, human weaknesses: greed, anger and stupidity.  Every year in March department stores all over Japan present elaborate displays in connection with the Doll Festival. If one looks carefully at the miniature weapons, musical instruments and furniture of a really complete display one will find a tiny backgammon board, a Japanese chess (shogi) board and a go board.  The `Three Games' is a useful classification because taken together they make up a coherent world view. Most of philosophy boils down to speculation centered around the three basic relationships of the human species. The first is man in his relationship to the remote gods and the mysterious forces of the universe. The second is man in the society he builds up around him. The third is man in his own self. Or, to put it another way, man the backgammon-player, man the chess-player, and man the go-player.  That we have these three shows that they answer basic needs in the human spirit. People everywhere are preoccupied with social structures, position and status; and everyone who is capable of reflection must sometimes speculate on his private relationship to fortune and fate.  But go is the one game which turns all preoccupations and speculations back on their source. It says, in effect, that everyone starts out equal, that everyone begins with an empty board and with no limitations, and that what happens thereafter is not fate or wealth or social position but only the quality of your own mind.   And I thought this is funny.    I got all this stuff on  urlLink http://www.kiseido.com

       >Soul Calibur 2  I went to gamestop yesterday and purchased a copy of Soul Calibur II. It has good gameplay and great character models. The only thing that was strange is that if you play with Kilik and you win he sometimes says at the end of the match, "This rod will be your doom!"  ewww. Thats pretty gross. If you look at ALL fighting games there is always some old demented guy. Like in tekken 3 there is this scientist that won't stop laying on the floor kicking you...v_v...It gets annoying! The Anime Unleashed Game will be released "SOON" and i will have it availible for download from this site.   Well I have nothing else to say...

Well, now's not a good time for a rant becuz I really want to watch that videO!!!!:))  I know you want me to complain about something, so I guess I will talk about this series i'm watching called "FullMetal ALCHEMIST" the anime is about two kids alphonse (AL) and edward both sharing the same last name of Elric. What got me interested in the anime in the first place is that morgan webb had a feature of it on xplay of the video game coming out in japan. Well the story starts out as the brothers are looking for the philosipher's stone (not related to the english rough-draft of harry potter). Al had lost his entire body and his soul is binded into some armour, Edward had lost his left leg and his right arm and it was replaced by auto-mail. They lost their bodies (or parts) by trying to ressurect thier mother by using alchemy...  ---  I really want to watch naruto, so you'll just have to wait for an episode guide!^_^  g'bye  alt code of the day: alt0505 = ù

       >The Alt-codes Archive  I'm finally back on track with life...(If i ever was)^_^  Well yesterday I posted a Thread on the  urlLink Gaia Forums . The thread was against yaoi and also a petition to add a fanfiction subforum, supposedly no one understood what I was saying. So they bashed me and I decided to leave the forum...  No Way.  I still like gaia and every anime fan I know is Involved in it, so i just used my other account that is set up before for fun called OnlyOneShinobi.  I was gonna move my stuff In the first place. But I knew I shouldn't have given up...but there were just so many gay fanfiction writers it was scary. Once I left there were more ppl there defending me...  I guess things work, when I'm not there.   Well anyways (I don't know whats wrong with a fanfic subforum)  I'm gonna make a new banner, supposedly because the ppl in the forum didn't like mine because it had Sai in it and they claimed him as gay. My forum wasn't about bashing gay ppl. It was about moving the threads to a "fanfic forum" They had been very popular topics and we're annoying.  Alt code of the day  Alt-02020=ä

I have not gone anywhere with that video.  Life gets in the way and I'm gonna try to be more dedicated. I'm having to "re-make" the video on movie maker.

       Well. for the 3 people out there flaming me about my bais fanfiction post, you can stop now.  Really I will never like fanfiction more than the real thing, and I don't think anyone will.  I have been looking around and On fanfiction.net i found a thing that says some authors will not allow fanfiction based on their work allowed on the site, so yay them.  I still don't like the yaoi/yuri fics out there, practically ruining a story.  but there is non-gay fanfics out there, so Zell proposed to me that we make a fanfiction site in our fandom section. I haven't up loaded the new site yet because angelfire is broken...again.  I have a new staff page I want to put up, also to link to my writing and zell''s fandom fettish site (that I have to make...)  well, I'm out.

       Well, how can I say it...Harrison can't keep up with a project. We plan all of these cool things to do, but never do them. We had an idea a while back to spend a whole day inside a few refigerator boxes.  We never did it.  But, w0t0 was something different. We got the entØr page up the first day, and we were hoping to actually create something besides an army on AOE. I have done two comics both pleading him to send me something.  I decided to start one myself.  Harrison is very welcome to actually start the w0t0 project again. I will make my own comic, sadly, IT will SUCK.  I have always worked on my drawing skills but my brain works on patterns, and I am very creative. My brain almost doesn't want to make something like a drawing.  ---  Shelby is THY mad at me because my blog is becoming a rant corner besides a journal. My blog is very different from other peoples. Morgan Webb rants, Piro rants (it is his job), and I have yet to see a blog that I did not inspire to not be about ranting. An online journal is for complaining and you will probably read peoples journals and their life would be completely different in the real world. I usually don't follow traditions, I make my own.  So now will be a mix of both.-  ---  Zell started a yahoo group (link later) and I am looking forward to hanging around there.  I am making my personal site (link later) and I enjoy making a site the way angelfire intended, where all you do is a layout and  select clipart .

       Holy *^%$ this game is so! addictive.     I could play this for hours. It is a strategy game, in greek times. No. It is not AOM but i would say AOM is bettØr. You make armies, economies, and you have to destroy the opposite team. It is so freaking fun. eh, I dont want to go to skool tomorow...I just want to play this game.  I haven't tried it online yet, but i am content even if i am playing with AI. What is amazing is that i bought this game a few months ago in a pack of strategy games and I have only tried RISK and AOE there are civilization and majesty left in the package...

       Hello, Well I made a little mistake posting a link to one of MY rants on the most popular anime forum in the US (GAIA). Most people on gaia, are gay and write fanfiction. So thats why I made my own forum, to get away from gaia. After all the arguing yesterday, I was inspired! So I wrote an intro to a story called (pause) "Spy Ware Killer" It is about a program talking in first person about his adventures in killing spyware...All I did was write the introduction, so it is no wonderful work of art. Maybe I should (see comments on last post) start writing fanfiction to improve my writing skillz.  ---  I got the title to work, heh, I keep using "> >>) Actually "Elad's hub" is only a place for me to put all my little sites. The MINI SITES tab are pages that are made by anime g33k aka "me" And are affiliated only with the blog. heh, i need to link to those ^^;;.  ---  Please check out my site at the  urlLink hub  even if you are just visiting.  ^_^

          Why I hate fanfiction, a essay (rant) by Anime G33K     Fandom, nothing is wrong with it. But when people start writing fanfiction, it almost completely ruins the story. Most of them have barely no writing skill, and they have no ideas of their own. You will be complemented more if you create your own stories, characters, and settings. If you were an author, and it took you 2 years to make a book, slaving over a cold cup of coffee and writing with a pen almost out of ink on a napkin, you get your book published, someone makes a movie out of it. Everything is great right?  No, It's not.  You are looking on the internet and notice that fanfiction.net has added a category of your story. You are flattered at first, so you decide to read one of the stories. The writer makes all of the characters gay, changes all the settings so every house is made out of plushies...You see people praising the story, like it is a wonderful work of art.  How would that make you feel?  ---  What I am trying to tell you is that since you can make story lines, all you have to do is make characters and a setting.  If someone we're to write a naruto fanfic, he could easily change the characters and make an ORIGINAL ninja story.  I was once among them, I wrote a lotr fic about ents, then I understood what I had done to Tolkein. Something told me that I made him turn over in his grave...I could have easily called them treelords and it would have been MY story.  I have found to love fictionpress.com instead.  really.  Think about what you are doing to authors. Just think, would they appreciate your actions. If they say no, You are not a FAN.  (please comment)

       > > > I really can't handle this world.  Sleevo, one of my BEST friends insulted me on the forum.  Since we we're having arguements before that, I obviously thought he wasn't just playing the game. It is hard to be an admin and a friend to the same person. Especially someone like steven.  I deleted the post and told them to stop making fun of me.  Lance made a really big deal about it and I really didn't even think about it.  Supposedly everyone was making fun of everyone, but i didn't read the whole thing, which made me sound selfish. but. Steven wouldn't have argued if it was another admin besides one of his friends. That was the ONLY post I had ever deleted. I don't edit posts, I add to them. But, i couldn't handle it. My mind was on survival mode and that freaking proxy server program didn't WORK!  So I took the easy way out, for once.  It hurts...really none of my friends have apreciated what I've done, I don't think I have ever heard a thank you from any of them. None of them notice how I feel. And I AM STILL THE "selfish" ONE!  what the hell, this isn't worth it.

Fanfiction, fanart, people taking other peoples creations and altering them. Fanart is ok in some ways, but not when the characters are obviously acting different than they are in the real story, or cartoon that they are in.  "I am making this for a fan, by a fan, only to increase the popularity of (insert title here)"  You are, but that is probably considered disrespectful if you toy with the story or characters by the original author.

       >Skool projects    Rant Initiated...   Dear Blog,      School now-a-days is completely useless. I was assigned a project to make an animal out of geometric shapes and it turned out like shit. Yes they do give us work and teach us stuff but still half the time they are correcting the students that are off task and sometimes all we do in a period is grade papers...WE ARE ALL GOING TO HELL!!      They need to fix the skool system and actually teach us things, get rid of all the kids that are disrupting so we can learn something. Damn public school...I am an A student and I can figure out why everyone is an ass all the time, My friends are AP students and they aren't immature.       A reason why i decided to move is because of this, everyone is trying to make me multi task and I can't. If i watch tv kids are always at school, and barely have a life. All of it is, "are you gonna go out with her", or stupid things like that.      A middle school relationship doesn't even matter, It is stupid, seriously is anything going to happen!? No its not. I don't even know why I try anymore...Oh yeah, it is to get money for A-kon.      If I was like most of the kids in the school I would get 200$ for every Time i got straight A's, I would be rich if I we're them, Their parents wan't more, I guess.  I'm glad for what I get, I got a computer for christmas and It still isn't old!  (thanks dad)  Straighten Up Your LIVES!

My next project just popped up in my head. I am gonna make a little theater/arcade section of my blog. It will have games like shinobu (see previous post) and little flash movies and such.

       G4 and techtv merged to make one network deticated to teaching us how not only to be a gamer, but to be an extremely obnoxious one!  Once I get fast internet here I will do some serious flaming on their boards.  I have never had anything against G4, I saw some clips from E3 on their site before they took over techtv. It is a gaming channel and I wanted it, but knew I would never get it.  They merged and swallowed all of the techtv shows whole. Call for help is gone, and most of the time G4's shows are on, less than 1/4 are old techtv shows. I wish there were just 2 channels and I had both. Who's idea was it ANYWAY!  Oh well.  If you didn't know I moved my first load to tyler and my room is actually above the bottom 4 feet.  I will have some more time to do stuff this summer, maybe start on my webcomic. I have been thinking about it and I may never start on Farkle. It is a lot of work, and I would rather bring you guys some other content that is fun to make.  See you at a-kon!

       It seems like seventh grade will go on forever, I can hardly believe that I will never sit in Mr. Stateler's class again. If you guys don't know Mr. Stateler was my favorite teacher, he taught me science in a way I have never done before. The School year will end tomorrow at 11:20 am. After I take my reading exam I will be off to home... packing.  "It seems like the end of everything" said my brother. We are moving, he graduated, I will not sleep in this bedroom ever again, and school ends tomorrow.  A few people are coming over for our might of debauchery. It will feel weird not being in this house, I will probably buy it back in 2015.  -out

       I am DONE with school wednesday at about 11:20.  The day after we take our first load to tyler I end up hanging around (I do not actually know what I am doing before a-kon) for a week or so.  We officially have to be out of the house by june 3rd the day after is a-kon in which I am the slaves of Harrison's parents. Harrison has not had good luck with his money, he may not want to go because he doesn't even have enough to get in. I will then be forced to give him some money or else I cannot go. I am not telling anyone how much money I own but it is about 5 times as much as I usually have stored in my secret place.   ugh  It is 15 dollars to get in for a 12 year old and 35 for a 13 year old. I will lie since my b-day was only 2 days ago.  I can't wait to get rid of all my money, I will post pics and list of everything in my 2 backpacks.  bye

       I am sorry for posting these things at about 11 at night, I was really busy today.  My brother graduated high school. It was probably one of the most boring 3 hours of my life, it took about 3 seconds for every kid to get his diploma... all of this added up to about half an hour.  I actually started playing ct again, I paused for a while to get away from the rpg's. I bought Breath of fire II but I am going to return it. It already formatted my cartidge the first day, that is why I hate to play some old games.  I got a lot of money today, some relatives stopped by for a graduation party for Allen. My GREAT grandmother gave me five dollars, she is about half my height though. I have to write all of these people thank you notes.  I have been talking with a bunch of realatives from both sides of the family until now...when I finnaly get the chance to post.  -all for now

       Well I just read joe's xanga (I am too lazy to make a link just go on the sidebar) I am getting a lot of compliements about the forums (also on the sidebar). Luciferian also had a short sentence about the forum, now I know it will never die. Forums only die because the owners give up on them, but heck I have a pretty good attention span when it comes to these things. Joe has to be one of the coolest people I've met, he actually has a weblog, and he isn't a jerk ^^ I have obviously had a weblog longer than him he started mother's day.  I bought an airsoft gun with a very small portion of my b-day money. It is a shotgun and I already got in trouble for shooting the neighbors ^_^. ne ways no harm done. The thing has great accuracy and I can hit a pole 30 feet away. I saw harrison at academy when me and Ben where buying ours. Harry got an uzi and it is the coolest ever. He was unloading out the car window near mailboxes >  Total, today I got $17Ø.ØØ minus the gun and I have about $125. I will get more and I will end up with about 200% more than anyone I know is bringing, I am buying them all something (under 3 bucks hopefully)... Part of it is guilt and some of it is generosity, I am not short on cash and some of them are, I think Harrison has 4 dollars.  Oh well. I want to say thanx to shelby for the 13$ I will send it back to you on ur b-day!  ^_^ Elad out

       Today we got our yearbooks. I got all my friends to sign it, and I was amazed as I was last year of how many friends I have. Shelby took up a whole page, practically writing a story. She cried while she was writing it, but she knows I don't want my friends to be horrified by the fact I am moving. Every family does it.  During the awards ceremony I was given the award of best in Mrs. Morgan's english class. I should have been in pre-ap and she knows it. I didn't hear her but she said that she was going to miss me. Mrs. Morgan is my favorite teacher and I praise her for putting up with all the crap the other kids have given her, usually I am happiest in first period so maybe that is why she will miss me.  ^_^   urlLink A-kon  is coming up and I can't wait, I hope  urlLink wizzywig  is there.

       Blogger is getting a lot more fun. They just updated their service and junk and it feels like xanga or live journal. I started one because... 1. I have a website 2. I do not have to be myself 3. I can rant in public 4. I can entertain while also writing in a journal  and my brother and uncle had them.  I am no longer a noob, or lamer. I have more than 100 posts and I have kept it for more than half a year, w00t!.  I am changing the name to "Elad's Blog" because i have used "elad" on a bunch of sites and I like the name.  Elad is actually Dale backwards which is my middle name. I may change the template in a few seconds, but more is definetly gonna come!

What is amazing is that I met most of these people THIS year. They got to know me, now I am moving. It is really hard to befriend me, because I don't ask for much. I only expect people to not act like a tard.  I feel like an ass, doing this to my friends. No one is gonna suffer more than Shelby, I bet she is bawling right now.  Another sad thing is that I WANT to move, I WANT change. I have lived here forever, and I love the place I am going.

       Lately life has been fun, I got a controller for my comp so I can enjoy life staring at an emulator.  "Saitek" says the label on it, and it actually feels "good." I never was really fond of pc controllers because they were always deformed.   I will bring out the most minor problem in my life now and rant about it, what else would help make my blog more bloggier?  Ry, the one on my blacklist... Is acting like a jerk, don't know why, but I thought about it while I was cutting out sprites. It is almost like he is jealous of me or something, but again, I am more mature than half the people walking the earth.   nehh   I am about to mow, boring as helk.  g'bye ^_^

       If you don't know, I am moving two hours east to Tyler, Texas. I currently live in Colleyville which is near Fort Worth and Dallas. All my friends are mad that I am moving but I am pretty excited. I have slept almost everynight of my life in this house and have seen the same things every day, in this city. I will have a great 5 acres and a lot of time to do nothing.  School is frustrating, I usually do well, and I have only gotten about 3 or 4 b's this year, the rest are A's. I am just sick of it, I can't work in class listening to random people yell "britney!" in the most annoying voice that you could think of. I obviously have more common sense than everyone, besides my group of friends (followers, leaders, and entertainers). It is all ending next wednesday. I am tires of being around a bunch of dumbasses. I knew I should have taken pre-ap, but I was convinced that all it was is more work. I was the one punished for wanting to learn without being overworked.  Hi Shelby...  I am gonna miss my friends, and I have heard from some of their moms that they are already getting mad about it. I have a few friends, all of them really close. The others, I just wish they would leave me alone.  My b-day is coming up this friday, amazingly I will turn 13. Even though I am more mature than 2/3 of my class I am one or two years younger than them. All I want is money for  urlLink anime-kon . I will probably buy a thousand plushies and have more fun than I can bear. I get to choose where I get to eat that night, but I have no idea...  I am looking forward to all of this stuff coming up, some good, some bad. But they are all part of destiny...  Best sister ever Shelby, you rock!  ^_^

       I went to brando's party last night, it was fun, I crashed about 5 o'clock and we went to an unlimited play arcade. The ddr machine was broken and I played magical drop, which was a hell of a time...  I came back at around 3:30.  I was looking for a rom for magical drop and failed. There aren't any on the net and kazaa has none. But mame supports it...so wierd.  I thought I would sleep until dinner so I fell asleep on my bed only to wake up at 10.  I ruined saturday...  Things I missed during the 5 hours of sleep: 1. Looking for emulators 2. Going on a DATE 3. Eating 4. Having any time to do anything.  Sry Shelby, Brando, and Leanna. I screwed

       Crono trigger is getting addictive, pWnD said i shouldn't use a walkthrough but i got stuck and found out I was going the wrong direction...  The new forum  urlLink is set up  I didn't like proboards and the new one looks MUCH friendlier. I don't want to move all 1400 posts, I dont have any energy and I did not sleep well last night. I have to crash by 11 usually but I end up staring at my ceiling for 3 hours... I am exhausted when I wake up and I have a whole 10 minutes to get ready.  Then I get tired after lunch because of some retarded history project or someone being an ass.  Elad's Hub ver 2.1 is coming up. I still have to finalize it and buy my domain.  I hopefully will own eladnet.com and run my webcomic, adventures, and all my awesome-ness thru there.  For some reason I am real anxious to move, I want to get away and be alone for a while. I am constantly working on something and I just want to relax and work on my site for all you folks. Html is like a zen garden and Tyler above all is the perfect place to use that zen garden.  pWnD is helping me out with the forum, we got 9 members to sign up from the last forum and have 100 posts the first day. Charles is getting all bitchy because he thought all the old post were gone, but you can still  urlLink view  them.  My cool site of the day-  urlLink The ShyGuy kingdom  So many sprites my face is going to fall off.

        This is weird...From a post back jan. 3rd i said it was impossible to get a girlfriend, i was refering to a girl that I almost completely fell in love with after the first 12 words i said to her.  It has been 4 months since that. And she likes me now...  our convo:   undermyalarm: im reading my journal post that night at the party X69KiSsEs4YoU: oh u r X69KiSsEs4YoU: at paiges party? undermyalarm: yeah undermyalarm: i wrote undermyalarm: "and i found out again that it is impossible to get a girlfriend."

       Angelfire decided not to serve me anymore with direct linking capabilities. Thats why you will se "image provided by angelfire" or some crap like that on every image i have posted.  I found a place called photobucket, but i still have to move everything.  To look at the screwed pics, right click them and copy the source into your address bar.   ---  In other news, I Pulled out my old sketchbook, with horrible doodles of what i tried to interpret as manga... I ripped all those pages out and started from the other site so it reads right to left. Not because I am trying to imitate the manga feel, but because I am strangely left-handed for small things like a pencil. But I use my right for everything else, and i have learned to use a mouse with the right hand.  I've gotten into drawing before, making a sketchbook out of some computer paper or an empty math spiral. I drew horrible pictures and I even had some how to draw manga books. but just for a hobby i decided to start drawing again. I love creating things and I would like to create things related to what I purchase.  I made websites because I enjoy what sites GIVE to me, I am gonna start drawing because I use pictures drawn by other people.  I got a journal made at my cafepress store. It as the cast of the upcoming webcomic, "farkle" that will be featured on the new version of elads hub.  Well I get to stay home this weekend. Hope I have fun.^_^

       >New Template  I am trying to get a new template WORKing. I had one with squall as one of you may have seen while I was at b&n. I can edit it fine, but I would have to change all the titles to be like they used to be and manually do all my archives.  That means, a lot of work for me, and the same thing for you.  I am gonna stick with this one until I move and have more time (summ3r).  Well the gist on what is happening: My brother's friend was not accepted into the same college as him, so my brother is coming to tyler with us...sad thing and happy thing.  My parents have to deal with my b-day, bro's graduation, moving, and going to A-kon even when it is 2 hrs away  in the same 3 weeks   YAY fred from MT is coming to a-kon, geez I have to meet him. One of my favorite people.  Sp33king of fred I bought the re-issue of vol. 1 of MT, It has bonus stuff!  I will give a review later otherwise  I'M OUT!!   LL4MA

       http://jrshorty.blogspot.com/ is a perfect example, the guy that runs his ½ fandom site is a complete poser. All he watches is american anime, and took my name and as he would say added 'leet'...I'm sorry but its 'Elite'.  Damn Follower  He is trying to be like me and I absolutely dispise people who steal other people's ideas or worship the ground people walk on.  Seriously, he wants to be me.  COME UP WITH YOUR OWN SHIT!  I made a forum, and several sites that have been fairly succesful and he steal's my name, he should just change it to Ll4m@.  There is this one kid named josh, he follows me around and we are good friends sometimes. But i actually hate going to skool because of him. He is a follower and one of those people that ask stupid questions that no one knows the answer to, but obviously, I know everything...  I hate people with no self pride and/or ABILITY.  ---and the Llama, Hell, you dont even know html, altcodes, or even how to pronounce 1337 (üH - LëëT) YOU ARE NOT ME!  D4nm FØllØ\/\/3|2

       I really like it here, there isn't anyone around to bother me and I can just sit in my room and play .hack//infection. It is a different kind of peacefulness.  I have a friend out here, I sometimes go to his house and play UT2k4. I live in the country now, so I don't really have neighbors.  I am finally going to receive half of the money my dad has owed me, I think I have enough to pre-order a DS and go to the comic store and get some posters. Hopefully I can get some pics of my room, because it is huge.  Some people want to start an anime club at the comic store, and I need to start a GO club here.  Nothing happens here, so there is nothing to write about.

       I just had a donut, it was good.  I beat the extremely long second level of Viewtiful Joe last night. I've gotten stuck twice and I learned how to open a door which lead me to victory. The concept of that game is very simple, go thru 10 levels all huge with a 3d look to them but still keep the 2d sidescrolling idea alive. I love sidescolling games because of this game. It has addicting and fun gameplay with an extremely simple idea of a game. A sequel is going to be released on the GCN and the PS2.  Sadly I don't own very many shirts. I have worn a Diety shirt since 5th grade when I bought it at eisenbergs. So my mom took me to the mall to get 4 videogame related shirts. I just love the Nintendo shirts that they have.  The comic store in tyler is really cool.  urlLink Ground Zero Comics  has a big collection of fine literature and games. They hold magic, heroclix, and Dbz tournaments and I could go to all of them. I am still waiting to be accepted on their message boards. I am looking for some people to play  urlLink GO  in Tyler and the comic store would be a good place, but I am also looking at the library, the Barnes and Noble, and my garage.  Time for another donut...

       I haven't been posting because I am too tired to get up at 9:30 am and drive with my dad to work to be supplied with internet. We still haven't gotten it at home because of laziness and stuff. But my consoles are there to bring me goodness.  Harrison got a  urlLink Blog  He one a while ago but he abandoned it like every other thing he has done.  Anyways I slammed my finger in a car door, played Unreal Tourney, watched techtv and procrastinated with playing .hack//infection because my level is too low (7).  I will edit my sidebar now. Once Steven's Xanga is good enough to show to the public I will link him, but for now, just Harrison.  I am so behind with my internet duties...

            I bought those 3 games at gamestop 2 days ago. Sorry for not blogging, I only have the chance for my computer w/ internet if I follow my parents to work. We do not know when we will get one way cable internet hooked up, but it may be until the school year starts.  I am going to Harrisons tomorrow. It will be a visit but he can come sometime in July and we can build box houses.  I shall go do stuff.

       I always liked to program, usually from scratch. I can edit but usually the stuff I edit I don't really understand myself...  I played around with quickbasic last year and made a game. You can beat the game in less than a minute and is completely TEXT-BASED!!  Staring at Joe's xanga I wonder how he is so good at photoshop, html, and xanga templates. I am usually the one really involved with computers in my school, but his stuff is amazing. My dream job is to either be a programmer or the owner of the first gigantic anime store.  Also author of "How to rule the world with an internet connection" would be pretty awesome.  Hmm, I am gonna play with photoshop for a few minutes and show you what I get...  Nothing...I couldn't even change the color not to be a shade of gray.  I usually use a cheat program to make my sites. Netscape Composer is the easiest. Most of my sites are without tables which makes them very simple.  Well yeah, I suck at these things. I need to get my dad to teach me some photoshop and php.  If you don't read my forums (and you should) then you probably do not know that I beat that visual novel last night... So much for 20 hours of gameplay It takes 3 or 4 at most. I say "Don't buy this!" Phantom of Inferno was extremely boring, so I guess I will stick to rpg-based ones or just rpg's in general. I wan't more descision making not WATCHING MY DESCISIONS BE MADE!  Maybe AnimePlay will have some better ones soon.

          Yes, That picture means I am watching Hikaru No GO. I finished all 75 episodes early this year and just happened to click on the final episode today. If you don't know the anime is about a board game called GO. The anime got me into it and I used to play at the go club in Dallas. There were some people playing it at A-Kon and I wanted to go correct them but something prevented me...-.-'  What! Elad played a visual novel!?  You can either consider that sarcasm or not. I played  Phantom Of Inferno  last night. It was kinda slow but it got interesting after a while. The game said twenty hours of gameplay and I only played through one and a half...  -Elad

       Getting out of school, moving, and a-kon... I haven't been gone for nothing.  So much stuff happened I dont know where to begin.  We moved and we dont own our old house anymore all my stuff is in my room in Tyler and I am typing away at my dad's office. Everything happened so fast I couldn't keep track of it. Yay! no school. 7th grade went by faster than ever, Shelby cried and I told her to shut up, she could have just seen me at Page's party.  A-kon was a blast! I got Fred's autograph and bought a hundred bucks of crap. I took pics of all the good cosplay and I will have those up soon ^_^.  I am gonna scream at my harddrive now.

       You know what?  Most people use their weblogs for ranting about things that don't really matter in life, I've noticed that everything works out in the end, so why complain.  I have everything I want, things to waste my time, friends, and most importantly. God. God has given us everything and is completely fair he even died for all the stupid things we have done, and no one has given me anything more than that. I have recently pondered eternity, and if you belive, you will be given it. God cannot be proven by logic, but only by faith. If you only depend on logic to prove your point, you are truly ignorant.  It is good to be around people who agree with you, at camp everyone was republican/christian and it felt good for Steven not to yell at you when you have a point. Sleevo, if you actually read this I have to tell you, Repetition does not make false things true.  If I could leave my old life in colleyville, I would, but somehow I just can't. I am happy here, not stressed all the time by uptight city people and their PTA meetings.  I like it here, and I wouldn't go back if I was offered. It just isn't worth being stressed over.

       As many of you know since I have migrated east we are having a really hard time getting fast internet at our house. I am writing on the dial-up now, and it is really annoying. My dad would settle for anything fast, and I have been going to work w/ dad to use my comp there and dl anime.  Engineering camp ended, it wasn't real exciting all we did was learn plumbing and it was not very broad as I expected it to be. Hopefully their are programming classes I can take.  Some basic story is written out for this RPG I promise you that we will release a demo. And if you want to beta test for us, email me.

       Yeah, It&nbsp;snuck up on me too.  Mother signed me up for this camp at UT TYLER. We supposedly are learning to be engineers, and we played with a water thing today.&nbsp;The camp is the normal cliched camp, yes, a guy that is allergic to everything goes there too. I didn't think it was real interesting but it is for school and maybe we get to program...  Also for school the parents decided to make us start a group project, the other people decided that we should do an RPG. I really like the idea, I am team leader and I have to type out the story whenever I feel like it. It is gonna be about collecting keys to get this sword to bring peace to this world. How original.  I will actually make this RPG not like that thing I put in my first blog post about one. It will be published and it will be open-source. A website should be up soon.  -Elad

       Yup, the series has reached 92 episodes. Amazing, seems just yesterday I was watching #5.  I don't think I have ever gotten so much into an anime, it actually has good action and a cool story. It would make a freaking awesome videogame if they ran it with a Ninja Gaiden type engine. I have endured 91 episodes so far, and we are finally given the character Tsunade. After the whole Chuunin exam, we all wanted something different.  If you read the Newtype a month or two ago you are given a review for comic party. I looked at the store and found it, but it was something about yaoi so I put it back, being discouraged because I thought it was about doujinshi but no!  Then I went back a few weeks later and found that there was another manga called "comic party" I dont know how they ended up with the same title but they are completely different stories. The one I was interested in was there, with the doujinshi and all. But I am scared to buy it because of the impression.  Oh well who cares, Realbout Highschool 6&nbsp;came out and once the comic store gets it I will buy it from them because I want to support them. Screw Barnes & Noble with their Poetry Night.  I am almost finished with .hack//infection I will finally give myself the privledge to watch liminality, just a few more dungeons ^_^

       With the whole move and all I haven't complained. I really did not miss my friends. &nbsp; But listening to the 8th track on the Kill Bill CD brought me back to Brando's car which I miss. I would like it for my friends to move here, they would calm down and they have already been bias to their own city because of Tyler and its lan center. &nbsp; If they could just live here for a month they would change and I wish that they could be here. &nbsp; Except when they did come they stressed me out and brought some of Colleyville with them, the day after they left I rested all day, and I did not want to be bothered. &nbsp; It seems I have mixed feelings about this whole ordeal, and I might move back after highschool. I am moving out of the house the first day they let me, hopefully I get to start my business and learn to be a game developer or software designer. I have thought this over more than most teenagers. &nbsp; About the title, there are these things that make sheep noises but they are small, and I can't catch one to see it. My dad thinks they are frogs but I don't. I will make a website about them and hopefully I will get on  urlLink unscrewed  &nbsp; END

       Today was just a normal day, nothing special happened. I woke up, ate lunch, read some of "The Hobbit", and saw "I, Robot". &nbsp; I have never finished one of Tolkien's books, though I do have a collection of maybe ten of them. I decided that I am going to read some of his stuff today so I picked up "the hobbit" and read the first 20 pages. &nbsp; Before we saw I, Robot we went to Barnes and Noble&nbsp;and I read halfway through .hack//legend of the twilight. &nbsp; Then the most exciting thing of the day, is the movie. I, robot is based off of one of Issac Asimov's books, he is one of my favorite scifi writers just like Bradbury.&nbsp;It was pretty action packed the effects they did with the robots were cool and the fight scenes were awesome looking. I usually get the chills when something of pure awesomeness happens and I got the chills twice in this movie. There were the obligatory man running torward machines army scene and some hand to hand stuff between the good robot, and the bad ones. &nbsp; The three laws of robotics: &nbsp; 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  &nbsp; 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. &nbsp; Of couse my dad building  urlLink robots  I grew up with these in my head, and are not a surprise to me. &nbsp; This movie shows how artificial intelligence&nbsp;does have a free will, it just needs to discover it. &nbsp; A few days ago I saw King Arthur, I guess it was kinda good Troy was much better though. It was supposedly the "truth" behind the myth. I recommend seeing it. &nbsp;   Second from the left is the coolest

       Sorry I didn't post yesterday, my stomach hurt real bad so I went home and slept. In 6th grade I had a real bad stomach ache I finally learned to sleep and it went away, but man do those hurt.  My skin is starting to break out, no worries, at least I am not a prep and completely judged by my face. I really need a haircut, it is hard to have long curly hair it always goes POOF. I would like straight hair, It is much easier to tame and it doesn't go POOF!  Floating around  urlLink gamespy  last night with our dial up POWER! at my house I found out about the  urlLink Metal Gear Solid   urlLink comic book  and I read the first few of  urlLink IT CAME FROM JAPAN! .  Amazing what you can lear by spending 5 minutes on  urlLink Gamespy.com .  Off to attempt to play America's Army.

       Harrison called me sheltered.  I wouldn't say that compared to the other people here in Tyler. He defineltely used the wrong word. I was the same as I have always been exept calmer. Not being subject to the obnoxious behavior of my old friends.  I've always hated the way they acted, obnoxious, loud, and selfish. If one of them could live here then they would understand how easy it is to be calm if you are not in the city.  It would be a gift if you could put up with them for more than 2 days if you have lived in Tyler. I myself have a lot of anger built up because of the inefficient way society works.  Company is like fish, only good for two days.  I am not sheltered, I was only annoyed.  ---  On the happier care-free side of Elad that only comes out when I am listening to music by  urlLink Nobuo . I am cleaning up and rebuilding my old computer, The one I got in November. I just seems to not work as it did when I first got it. I shall defrag and remove all useless files.

       After reading  urlLink Sara Lane's Post about Micheal Moores new movie  I kinda got mad about how everyone cares. I myself have very strong political and religious beliefs. In the city, attending public school (which I have nothing against) I found most of the people that spoke out differed from me, even though most of the people were agreeing with me they just ignored the obnoxious fools who expressed their feelings in a public environment. Now that I have moved, most of the people here I know are homeschooled and agree with me but don't really care because they are the majority.  What really makes me mad is when idols say their opinions, I used to love the Beastie Boys' music, and now I wont read Cat's (from TTV) weblog. I have refrained from my opinion being expressed here because of most of the loud obnoxious liberals will scream at me because we are stealing oil... yet we are not stealing oil. We are selling it and giving it to Iraq. Not that hard people if you want to express your opinion watch FoxNews also!  The election is going to hell this November, Bush is the most hated presedent probably ever and Kerry changes his mind every other second. So obviously Kerry is going to win because of the "Vote for something" commercials on MTV.  Another thing I hated was when Reagan died, Foxnews was completely silent watching the funeral and CNN was talking about his love for chocolate.  But why should I care, I live in Tyler now.

       Moving to Tyler has definetely changed my attitude, I've been much calmer and not completely worried that someone will knock on my door stopping me from whatever I am doing.  Harrison and Brandon came to my house for 3 days. They wound me up, It is almost like they bring stress with them from Colleyville. I don't know why I have to keep dealing with that city but it seems like I always will.  The one thing I enjoyed was going to the  urlLink lan place , we payed 5 bucks for 2 hours of CS, UT, BF1942, and Quake there were some others but we pretty much played these.  There is a lot of stuff I want to do in Tyler. First is a  urlLink Go club  and second, lan parties. I don't know many people here but hopefully in highschool I could find some people.  Lastly in my post, I would like to address  urlLink this comic ...  So far, It is one of my favorite MT strips. The most favorite being  urlLink 495

       Some of our friends from Arlington are coming to set stuff on fire out at my house. We got some black cats and stuff, and it is legal to do stupid stuff when you live outside of the city.  For the fourth of July my family is going to have a BBQ in North Ritchland Hills so if any of my old friends want to see me, try to find me. Then we are taking Harrison and Brando home with us. So we can stay up all night and talk in the garage.  And just to rant for a few seconds.  I was always told to start the trends, do not follow them.  And I do just that, I made a weblog the first day of November last year and it seems a lot of people I used to know in FtWorth have a xanga or a blog, and simply they are making the service look horrible. Most of them dont use proper grammer and are still talking in shorthand in which they learned from AIM.  Just remember, I was the first.
