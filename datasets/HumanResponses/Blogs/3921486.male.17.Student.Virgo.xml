      I think i know why i have so much white/gray hair. I think way too much and worry about every little detail. I analized every details there is to a problem. I make it more complicated that it is. I wont stop thinking about it.  Yeah i should just relax and not worry about anything and my hair will probably be healthy.  If not i'll have an old man hair. So from now on I won't try to mourn about that pass or worry about the future.&nbsp;I know I say it a lot but I don't really follow it.  So am going to stay in the present and the present only.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So yesturday i went with my cousin ngoc to moorpark to pay our fees and see a counselour. She had an orientation at 4, we came there at 1 and got finished paying our fees and seeing the counselour around 1:30. Suprising everything was done quickly, so i decided to stay there with her until 4 for her orientation with the honors program. We saw our friend teri there and we hang out until 4. We walk around the campus and went to the vending machine. The honors orientation was in the admission office and i went in there with them, it was a small room. I ask to be in there eventhough I wasn't part of the honors program. IT was really helpful with all the info that the lady gave us. She ask me if i wanted to be in the program, i told her that i didn't meet the requirement because on the paper it say that you need at least a 3.25 gpa to get in the program and i had a 3.243.&nbsp;(I know .007&nbsp;) but she me told that okays, she can still let me in but i needed to show her my transcript. So she told me to go ask one of the counselour outside to print me a copy of my transcript from high school that my school sent to them but they just say no we can't print you one for some reason. So now am just going to mail it to her.   Am glad that i stay with ngoc b/c i got info about the transfering and important stuff and now part of the honor program.  which am excited for but a little worried b/c i never taken any honors class in high school but i'll try my best and try not to be lazy but that impossible....but I will try.   The honors program seem kind da easy to be part of, all you need is 15 credits of honors class, that mean 5 class. There lots of benefits provided like a special studying area, easier to get in UC school and a TAPS program that guarantee you to get in a UC.   But it also means a lot of works and time to put in.  So yeah......my future is ahead and am going to make the best of it.  you only live once.  well unless you believe in&nbsp; reincartion.  but that still different so nevermind.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

Went to Quizno's, had clam chowder, it was&nbsp;good at first, but not so much later.  Walk around&nbsp;Bed Bath and Beyond.  Went home.  Then practice driving with my dad, for almost 2 hours to moorpark and back too moorpark and back. then the local&nbsp; and back the local and back. then stop at his friends house and waited for an hour in the car infront of some one house.  I had to go to the bathroom also so i was just holding it in for an hour. :( They were infront of their house thinking i was some rapist waiting for someone or something in that area.  Just sat there and listen to music and look up in the sky.  Finally went home and ate another bowl of spaghetti.  and now going online.

      why should I care about what you think?  why does your opinion seem to matter to me?  why do i give a Fu_k about what you say?  why should i even care?.  but i do anyways.  it's not what i want to.  because i just take things seriously.  when I shouldn't b/c in the end.  it's only going to hurt me.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "poem that i wrote"

      How is it possible to still like someone when you know that they don't know you.  How is it possible to&nbsp;&nbsp;can't wait to&nbsp;talk to them when they don't care to talk to you.  How is it possible to be with with them when they don't want to be with you.  How is it possible to love them when they don't love you.  &nbsp;  Because you know&nbsp;you can't live with out them.  Because you know&nbsp;you want to talk to them.  Because you know&nbsp;you want to be with them.  Because you know&nbsp;you love them.  &nbsp;  "when you truly love someone, you must let them go" quote from my sassy girl movie.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"poem i wrote" inspired&nbsp;from a movie that i saw.&nbsp;

      did so much today. IT was really cool.  It's started out with going into the beach (Santa Monica) with jen, tina, ngoc, tony, peter, kristen, and quyen. We first just play with the wave a little bit and then use the boogie board. Riding the wave wasn't that fast but there a certain trick to it, that i found out later on but i wish i didn't.  The trick that i use was to stand at a certain distance from the shore and wait until the wave almost comes to you and then jump forward and then you ride the wave really fast and far then you would normally.  So i use that trick to ride the board again and again. it was really fun but then i wanted to do just one more b/c we were sharing the boogie board.  So it started out really well and i end up went really fast and thought at the moment that this is best ride on the wave so far and the wave was really strong and just took me near the shore; the board grinded against the sand and side of the board hit my stomachs for about 5 second and flip me over.  it hurt so bad and my visor fell off also and i thought i lost it but my cousin found it later near the shore.  &nbsp;  so i didn't want to ride the board anymore and decided to swim. my and my cousin went really far out and we didn't realize it though and we try to get back in. we start to see the life guard whistling and tell us to come back. i didn't realize how far we got and it was really hard for me to swim back. and my cousin was in the board trying to paddle back but she seem stuck. The life guard just started to swim out and got her back to shore.  That was definitely the highlight of the day.  &nbsp;  well we went home and i took a shower and there was sand in my butt.  right after that my cousin (ngoc)&nbsp;call and invite me to go to eat at a thai restuarant with my other cousin (hue) &nbsp;that came to visit from santa ana.  It was good food that we had; it was pretty much the same people that went to the beach minus tony and adding hue and rachel. &nbsp;  after that we went to my house and just sat around thinking of what to do and pick up fruit outside in the backyard.  then we went to k-mart. and bought a towel and some dentyne ice.  It was really fun but i left out some details such as sitting on the beach to dry off and bought some stuff from a&nbsp; lady. we bought old M&M and ngoc bought a hat.  and i left out K-mart close down special on 99 cent slice of pizza, icee, hot dog and crazy bread.  and i bought an icee but it wasn't 99 cent but 1.28 b/c i came late for the special....all well.  &nbsp;

      On friday I went on a San Francisco tour. We had to board on the bus at 6.15 am. The bus was late and we talk to everyone and it seem like everyone was going to different places but only one bus came. We though it's not going to be our bus but everyone got one it and we were the only one left and we went to ask and good thing we did b/c we needed to get in there.  The bus took us to San Gabriel and we abort another bus. (2hrs) That bus took us to Solvang, an Dannish town. In Solvang we had an hour and half to have lunch and look around. We ate at this Dannish restaurant that was expensive and not that great of food. Then we walk around and bought some stuff at the gift shop.  After that we went to Hearst castle. (2hrs) We got to go on another bus to get us up to the castle. That ride took around 15 minutes and it was scary b/c we were going up hill in a small lane and there no rails on the side in case if the bus tip over it will save us from rolling down the hill. The castle was big and has a lot of fine art. The stairs were crowed and small to go through. The views from the castle on the balcony is amazing. There were 2 giants pools that was very cool.  After hearst castle it was another hour and half to get to our dinner place. We went to a buffet that the tour guide recomended us and it wasn't that good. We had an hour for dinner and then we would head back to our MOTEL.  The Motel wasn't nice at all and there wasn't that many channels on t.vs, only 14 channels. On top of that we had to wake up at 4;15 am to leave at 5:am to go to yosemite.  The drive to Yosemite was almost 3 hours and one hour of it was in the forest with the bus turning every 5 second. There wasn't much there at Yosemite excepts TREEEEEEESSSSSSS. We had an hour there to look around. We went to see that water fall but was dissapointed b/c there was only a little bit of water coming out of it. After seeing that we had breakfast which was expensive, 8 bucks for a plate of 2 strips of bacon, a scop of potatoes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bread and a milk for 8 bucks. well actually it's not that bad comparing to that Dannish restaurant.  We got back on the bus and stay in there for almost 3 hours to San Fransico. Once we got off, we went on a San Francisco cruise on the Red and White boat. The cruise was nice and we got to see some seagull flying right near the boat. It was a fun ride on the boat. I got to see Alcatraz Island, the view of the city and dissapointed not to be able to catch Angel Island. Good thing we got some gifts after we got off the bus b/c after the cruise we had to get on the bus right away to go to China town.  China town was interesting to see. We had dinner at this place that the tour guide recomend and it sucks. The service was horrible and they mess up my food but i ate a little bit of it so they're were like okay you can just eat that and i was like it's okay, and i was hungry and i would feel kind of bad for them.  After that dinner, we walk around and this Japanese lady join us also and for dinner too b/c she was by herself and she sat next to me on the bus. after dinner we went on the bus and drove almost an hour to finally a nice 4 star hotel. Nice rest room with nice shower and stuff to use with a nice view and a lot of channel on T.V. We got up at 6:15 and went on the bus around 7.  We get to go see this garden where there a weird rode that i can't really describe but all it is, is just flowers. After the garden we got som Dim Sum and this Chinese restuarant. It took awhile for the lady to come around with the food but the Dim Sum was good and decent price.  After that it was just the ride home. Drove for 2 hours and stop at a pit stop to have lunch. Had some Taco Bell and some ice cream. When we were almost home, 40 minutes away from our last stop. The bus engine stop and we had to sit in the freeway for 2hrs and it was freaking HOT!!!!!   Details.  People I sit next 2. Day one: someone wife for like 30 mintutes then change bus and sat next to one of the tour guide.. Day two: sat next to a Japanese lady that was nice. Day three: sat next to this teenage punk that was older than me.   People in the bus:  The majority of the people were asian except for 5 out of 50. There was some tall mo fo asian people.   Sleep at:  First night was at this crappy motel that was kind da nasty but it's okay. Second night was at a nice hotel that was very clean. Third night was at my sister husband mother house, there was an extra room.  Things I ate: First day: Dannish food, cold roasted beef, rocky road fudge, then a buffet. Second day: Breakfast at yosemite, egg, potatoes and bacon. a hot dog in the cruise and ginger ale. Then later at a chinese restaurant that had bad service. Third day: Dim Sum for breakfast with tea and later Taco Bell quesadilla and one taco.  Overall it was a great experience. Tiring for sitting in the bus for hours. Disgusted from having to us different kind of bathroom all the time, some are just plain nasty. I didn't like how we had a time limit in each places where we get drop off b/c we don't have enought time to do what we want. We were late a couple of times to the bus.  Places visit. Solvang Hears Castle Yosemite -The water fall San Francisco -Golden Gate Bridge -Alcatraz -supposely Angel Island but I didn't see it. -China Town

      Today was awsome. I was suppose to get this paper sign from my school for the insurance company and only my sister was home but she was busy studying. So i didn't want to bother her and decided well i plan to go myself anyways.  So i started out pretty cool and drove there but I made a fast turn. Park, went in and got sign and went out and went to Mcdonalds. I had some troubles with the lights turning yellow and then not sure when i should turn and other traffic lights rule that i had forgot but going to review it now.  But i went to Mcdonalds drive through and got a salad and went home. I had to find a way out of Mcdonalds also b/c the exit that I took out of the drive through was only one way which is the opposite way of my house but i manage to turn into some store and went around and got home SAFELLLLLLLLLLLLY. phew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What I learn from this, Is what a bad driver I am. But practice will make it perfect..... I  hope. So wish me luck on the rode. And if your driving next to me.....ummm good luck!
