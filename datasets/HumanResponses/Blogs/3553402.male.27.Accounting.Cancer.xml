      Well, the indoor football league season has finally finished.  We finished a respectable 4th, given the terrible start we had to the league (losing our first two games).  So time and tide wait for no man, and already the touch rugby season and Banker League (outdoor football) season is upon us.  We played our first Touch game this week, and recorded a record win (for our team).  Last season we were quite a green team, with no experience (and no chance!)....now with a few Southern Hemisphere players we were a whole lot better, running in the tries for fun.  Its still very hot at 5pm when we play, so we sub quite regularly to keep fresh legs on the pitch.  The Bankers league will be a real test of how far the football team has come, after our experience in the indoor league, and regular training every monday.  Its like Euro 2004, we have a mini league to get through first, and then into the knockout stages.....all very exciting.  Speaking of Euro 2004....good result for England against the Swiss, and some other notable results (eg Germany Latvia - haha) have made this a very unpredictable tournament.  I still fancy France to grind out a win overall, but watchout for those Czechs.......

      Hello, I think I have cracked this malarkey now, so I can go on and bare my soul to the world (lets face of all the things I could bare, my soul is probably the best).  Technology like this is all a far cry from when I were a kid, when the best you could hope for would be a perfume scented letter from your Nan.  Those simple days of lying on your stomach on your mates driveway swopping your Football 85 stickers.....eyeing up his Glen Hoddle, whilst your mate was trying to snaffle Viv Anderson right from under your nose.  Nowadays its all pension schemes and  mortgage s.  Anyway, my wife and I are currently posted out in the back of beyond, on a small piece of volcanic rock owned by the Brits in middle of the caribbean (very much the colonnial explorers).  This little rock only rises a puny 60 feet above sea level at its most highest point....standing on tip-toes makes a difference.    This island is all of 25 miles long and roughly a mile wide (though thinner at some points).  Bizarrely enough because of its tax laws and financial regulations, it holds the title of fifth largest financial centre in the world (on asset deposits).  Hence the demand for accountants like myself (otherwise it would be fish for tea every night).  This is no Castaway island with Oliver Reed staggering about half cut, oh no, this is a mini-metropolis with a fast beating financial pulse (well relatively speaking).  The other main attraction of the island (if you can ever call tax legislation an attraction) is the beautiful 7 mile beach which attracts tourists from all over the world in their boatloads - literally, as this small island of 40,000 people caters for 1.5 MILLION cruise ship tourists each year.  Staggering.  Its location is ideal for a pasty pom like myself, as it is moored just off the coast of Miami, perfect for travelling and the like.  It is also sheltered from the nasty hurricanes somewhat by the surrounding islands (Cuba to the North, to the west Jamaica and to the East and South the Americas).  We have been out here for almost two years now, and love the place.  Its easy to get to work in the morning, great social life and fantastic for travelling.  Also, we have found ourselves exceptionally popular with family and friends attracted by a custom made holiday location.  Well, I'd better cut this little story short now.  To all our friends and family back home, we miss you all, and think of you often.  Take care - love Ben & Sarah
