       We had a nice afternoon/evening in the boat. We fished for about an hour. I got 5 "makrell" (Don't know what that is in English), and Hege, my wife got 2 "Pale/sei". (Don't know what that is in English either.)  Nice and warm weather. A bit rain when we started, but at the end, the sun was shining. About 20 degrees Celcius.  We are looking forward to next time already!

       I am now posting from my email. If this works fine, it will be much easier to maintain my blog. And to keep it updated with info all the time.

       Well. I didn't figure uut the TestSuite yesterday. But I didn't need to either, cause I didn't need to use it yesterday. But I guess I will today, so I'll better get up to speed soon.  By the way, is there anyone out there who has a download link to firmware for a Siemens C60 mobile-phone? I have, by an accident deleted mine. :-S  Today, I will work some more with SCORM, and JavaScripting.

       Yesterday I had my first info-meeting about the study I am going to take. I am this semester starting on a 5 year study which, hopefully, will end in a master-degree in ICT.  I am really looking forward to finally getting some education, that is relevant for what I am working with.  Wish me luck with my studies!
