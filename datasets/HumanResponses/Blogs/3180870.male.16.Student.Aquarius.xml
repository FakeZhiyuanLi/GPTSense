       urlLink    Although there is not much to credit, it goes to me. It was a digital picture I took of a wooden angel and through the filters and brushers of Adobe Photoshop, it came to be this. If the picture looks really low quality, click on it and follow the link, that should give you a better one.&nbsp; urlLink

      At the moment, I do not have a camera to take pictures with. So, all pictures on here are from other people that have just been doctored by me. I'll do my best to give credit to all of the real artists.

      Wow, today I have only done four things. That could be a lot depending on what those four things are, but to me I have done absolutely nothing. Do I mind? Hell no. Am I complaining? Not in anyway. I enjoyed every moment of it.  By the way, if Jennifer Merrill is reading this, she should already be in the process of taking that pic down.  I've realized that I've been totally biased in music and still am but others are too. What I mean is that people don't enjoy certain music when it isn't their favorite type of genre. For example, say that a girl Clemingtine loves the music genre country, she has two friends: Rebecca, who prefers rock, and Suzanna, who prefers country. Now imagine a five point system based on Clemingtine's liking to a new artist. LeAnn Rimes would be a five, very likeable, and Metallica being a one, not likeable, and three being neutral. When Rebecca mentions a new band it starts out with a three, but then when she mentions the genre rock or when Clemingtine first hears the riffs that she can identify as being rock two points are automatically deducted for not being country. In order for the music to become likeable to Clemingtine the band somehow has to identify with country in any way for her to pertain any interest otherwise she will lose interest and stop listening. Whereas when Suzanna mentions a new band and is identified with country, two points are then automatically added to Clemingtine's liking scale and it most likely that she will pertain interest and listen to the rest of the song. Because of this mental behavior it is probable that it is the sole or main reason we listen to so many bands that sound similar. Also, one of the few reasons we switch to different genres of music is because of "crossover" artists that let us identify with what we already like and introduce us into something new. Otherwise, it is not often that we listen to and enjoy new music that is completely different.  Now all I have to do is prove this in an actual study.

      Recently the Glendale Public Library charged me fifty dollars and forty-five cents for books and magazines and other sorts of literature for which I returned late. That's not even the worst part, they threatened to turn the debt over to a collection agency if it wasn't settled within seven days, that's what seriously ticked me off. Because, if they did hand it over my mom is somehow hooked up to my account so they would've screwed up my mom's credit on purpose. I'm serious when I say "those bastards." Of course this is all my fault and I took care of it right away. Somehow when I opened up the letter that told me how much I owed, my mom could tell it was gonna be beyond her comprehension of how it came to that amount if she found out. So, the following day I rode my butt down to the bank and took out a twenty, rode my butt home and then my mom rode my butt all the way to the library. It's still hard for myself to believe that I paid them thirty dollars that day. I figure I've paid so many fines since I was six years old that I've set a record or paid for numerous coffee table books. I've still got nineteen dollars and ninety-five cents to pay off, maybe I could stuff envelopes.

      The other day, I somehow came upon the mention of Winamp. I had totally forgot about it since I have been so obsessed with iTunes, which is still the best music player in the world. So I visited the website and they've got this new version out but for the better version you have to pay $15 and to put it short, I pirated the program. So now I have the pro version of this program and it is so much better than before. It has a billion more radio stations than iTunes even though a lot of them are worthless and it also has internet tv. The tv part is awesome since I have a huge variety and all I have to do is double click to watch Korean music videos. Even with all of this it's still no where near iTunes and iTunes only plays music whereas Winamp plays practically everything. Which brings me to my next subject.  Today I was grabbing a Lipton Brisk Ice Tea, or at least trying to, they've been out for two and a half weeks now. So while waiting in line to see if the vending machine had been restocked, the kid in front of me who is pressing all of the buttons looking for some drink has these white bud earphones sticking out of the top of his shirt into his ears. I'm like "I know those..." and BAM, it hits me, those are iPod headphones. Wishfully thinking he might've just jacked the headphones from one of his parents I look for a square bulge in one of his pockets. My wishes are dropped like a hot potato. I thought to myself, damn, this kid has an iPod, even if it's three years old, it's an iPod. I walked away without inserting my dollar damning him to hell and envying him at the same time for getting one before me. Which brings me to my next subject.  My friend Jesse has offered me a job, a job that sounds amazing. Amazing because it requires no skill and there is no interview. Basically what I've gotten out of him is that various corporations are going to give him envelopes to stuff with letters, he will then split up the work between me him and a few other people, we do our work, give it back to Jesse, he gives it to the company, he gets paid and then splits it up with us. I'll get a lot more details the next time I talk to him, I'll make sure I press it out of him. The only reason the "job" relates to an iPod is that it gives me an enormous amount of motivation to work to get money to purchase an iPod to flaunt it in front of everyone. Which in no way brings me to my next subject.  I decided recently, even though this does not matter at all, that I will never use numbers in my writing but that I will always write out the numbers. So I would say ninety-three instead of 93. I like it and that's the way it's gonna stay. Which in everyway brings me to the end of this post.

      Gotta write a poem using concrete nouns for English. Here goes everything with a subject of boredom.  On the way home, I came upon a traffic jam, slowed to a complete stop and pulled out a book. However, the words do not seem to draw my attention at this moment which result in me rotating the volume knob to the factory stereo. Head against the window, ambient pop music in the background, I stare out the window only to find seventeen blank cars with blank passengers surrounding me. The blank cars around me move three feet ahead all in attempts to cut eachother off and   Okay, boredom is not a good subject for concrete noun poetry. But heck this is a good way to write short stories, I'll have to finish that later. Here goes everything with a subject of anger.  He said "You're just not what we're looking for at this moment." Extra force is exerted to give a soft slam to the door closing behind me. Stepping out of the building, the red hot sun beats down on my face. In an attempt to cool down, I stop to eat at the local diner. Sitting down, the coarse wood seats tear at the very fibers of my skin. Accepting a menu from the waitress, the paper slices my fingers and large amounts of blood spill. Sucking on my fingers my attention is taken away to the three foot fires starting in the kitchen that spread to the furniture. I stay in my coarse seat, looking over the menu, sucking my blood, feeling the flames along with rejection to show the world my anger on the six o clock news.

      Created this account in hopes of receiving an invitation to G-Mail, but I was let down and saw they had no interest in me. Probably because they realized my scheme. Well, the page looks simple and stylish so it'll probably be a good place to post some writings. Now, if only I could find my pen.

      I was sitting in math today, not happily, and one of my good friends turns around and starts to tell me how he's gonna get his amanda pierced. At first I was taken aback and I still am. He thinks it'll be really cool and that it will get him more girls. That's what he thinks. I completely advised against it for a countless number of reasons. Even so, he's still going to get it done tomorrow. I can't believe he's gonna get his amanda pierced.

      Last night I realized I needed to get a job right away thanks to a certain sibling. Amazingly my dad took me out the same night to pick up some applications. I stopped at Best Buy, Comp USA, Sports Authority, and Trader Joe's. Trader Joe's is very cool but something about it made me not wanna work there. Sports Authority is even worse, they don't have an application to fill out but a a device that was three times as big as a PDA and a had a keyboard and something else but I forgot. The whole store is just a turn off. Leaving Best Buy and Comp USA. Best Buy has an online application too but some thing about the workers and store was weird. Maybe too laid back? Well that leaves Comp USA which is probably the hardest place to get a job out of these four. A reason it might be hard to get hired is that hardly anyone was shopping there. They were overstaffed when I was there. I'm still going to apply, but only to Comp USA and Best Buy. All I have to do now is figure out exactly the time period I will not be able to work as a cause of vacation and my sister's surgery. I'm aiming to get my applications in by this Saturday. By the way, I'm still working on the soap project and should be getting some envelopes to fill very soon.

      I will waste a perfectly good day today sinceI have to read three hundred forty-three pages of  Catch-22 ,  write an amazing book report after that, and finish all of my other homework. But it won't be entirely wasted, it'd be wasted if I was Mormon and went to church all day, that's just plain stupid. But of course, I should be reading right now. I will get back to my randomness later.

      In the words of another blogger, Joufy, "Do you think if you laid in the bottom of the shower while it was on, you could feel like the grass feels when it rains?" I thought that was pretty cool since I hadn't ever thought of that. (http://joufy.blogspot.com/)  I've realized a dissapointing fact recently. Basically, if I want to try to keep writing for the rest of my life, I won't ever be able to have a nice luxurious house with an amazingly beautiful backyard even if I could have it. Once you have that, there won't ever be anything  entertaining enough to write about. Nobody wants to read a tale of a perfect life, it would get boring very quickly (after the first page) and every reader would become extremely jealous.  I've started to write my short story. I can't say a whole bunch more than that but I am having a little trouble with the exposition.  By the way, me and my brother realized that all really good artists are from international countries but mostly from Britain. So, from now on, I will be watching Monty Python non-stop and the BBC in general. I will learn their slang, language, and accent perfectly and then I will replicate it. Then when I start a band or get into college, everyone will think I'm British and then I'll automatically get respect for studying overseas and not being an American.  Oh, one more thing. There is only one very extensive short story website on the web (http://www.short-stories.co.uk/) and a great job to them but where is our American site? Are we going to let everything be taken over by those British? Hurry you all, we need to scramble and set up some competition.

      What to write? What to write? I think all of my creativity is gone because of all this yearbook signing. I would love to just write the same thing over and over again, It'd just be so easy, but I couldn't. There's just too many of them. I mean, in math class I signed three. As in, I was carrying around three yearbooks that were NOT mine. Ugh. Well I need to get my muscles toned anyway. By the way, my broskey is on quest and we all need to help him out.       All you need to understand this quest is to watch Rushmore and you'll understand how she is the most underappreciated actress ever. By the way, what the hell is up with the actor/actress thing nowadays?? I always thought men were supposed to be called actors and women were supposed to be called actresses and it was this way for a long time. Until those utterly stupid feminists came along. It was feminists who came up with the idea that actresses should "break down the borders" and call themselves actors. The stupidest thing about it is that they're pretty much saying (and this isn't my opinion) that men are superior so lets try and live up to them by calling ourselves the same thing they call themselves. Ugh. When I do meet an utterly repulsive feminist I will force myself to say hi to her and then say something completely insensitive about women towards her. Yes, I will go out of my way to do it.  A while back I signed up to get a couple free issues of HOW, a graphic design magazine. It's a very cool magazine and if I had the money I would subscribe to it and the other magazines that are affiliated with it. Since I liked it so much, I signed up for the newsletter. Signing up for a newsletter is something I rarely do since they are all usually very unprofessional and crappy. But this one is unusually good. Try it out here (http://www.howdesign.com/newsletter.asp). So, I was reading through the latest issue and I was reading through the editor's note who was highly reccomending that everyone who was reading check out this website made by and about Keri Smith (http://www.kerismith.com/). I checked it out and it was really cool. I printed out some stuff in my business class just to waste paper again but I haven't gone through it yet.  Finally came up with a short story to write about. Well kind of. I'm very unusual when it comes to writing, if you can't already tell. I find that inspiration does not strike me in the form of plot but in the form of characteristics. Like with this story, every character will have a title and not a name except for the protagonist and his lover. So there'd be the protagonist, Bradley, and Suzanna, his lover, whereas everyone else would be The Mailman, The Waitress, The Ex-Girlfriend, etc. I'm doing this in an attempt to create massive indifference for all of the characters and then leave the reader caring for the characters who actually have names. So far the protagonist's name is Bradley. I don't like the name Bradley and I'm sure other people do too so if you have any suggestions please reply to this post.

      Summer is here and I'm so tired of hearing it from everyone that I'm ready to start my AP classes. Since I don't have a job and since I probably won't, I will have one aim this summer. To start up a version of PacManhattan in Arizona. After pouring through their site, hanging onto every entertaining word I've been wondering how I've survived all sixteen years of my life without this. I'm completely serious when I say "We have to do this, now." So all of you, check out PacManhattan's website (http://www.pacmanhattan.com/) and give me some feedback so we can do some recruiting and while you're on the computer check  out this artist Better Than Ezra (credit to my broskey). At least download the songs "At The Stars" and "King of New Orleans." I'm constantly told that my entries on here are completely random, which I think is absurd, but if they didn't think that, they wouldn't read it so think whatever you want, all I want are the site hits. Just kidding.  I just set up a new blog, my photo one. Since everyone else is doing it, why not? Check out and you can get there if you go to my link section on the right and click on "my photo blog."  Ever have the feeling to write down a musician's lyrics so everyone else can read them? I've just finished listening to every Better Than Ezra song I have and in each one, I wanted to share some of this guy's lyrics. But I won't because it would be stupid to do that, so you'll just have to hear them for yourself.

      Sigh, I've been living in my own little music world of hypocrisy for quite a while now. Without much of an exposition, I've been listening to "new upcoming artists" and when they do up and come, it somehow becomes very unlikeable. This in itself has no hypocrisy, but it's the fact that I'll rave about them, comparing them to other bands that are very similar and professing that "my" new band is so much better when they really aren't. The worst part is when they become mainstream and I detach all ties I had to them before and rant about how bad they really were. For example, take the band Franz Ferdinand, a European band (what a surprise) and I found out about them before they became (and still are becoming) popular. Credit to NME (http://www.nme.com/) for the pre-warning about Franz Ferdinand. I loved them for a couple weeks and now I hate them mostly because I saw their video on MTV and my lame and unfashionable MTV nerd chemistry partner asked me about a song,  Take Me Out , and if I knew who sang it, it was Franz Ferdinand but I just closed my eyes and just turned away. This has happened for quite some time and will until I stop looking for those up and coming artists. There's something about knowing about a good band before they reach the masses, you get a sense of proudness, but the thing is, nobody cares about who knew about them first. There is no distinctive line between good bands and really good bands, when you look at just the guitar riffs or the singer's pitch, everything else isn't considered. I have rules about dating, that there pretty much are no rules, if she's cool, she's cool. At the moment, I'm taken and I'm extremely happy with whom I'm with but with music, I don't have a mate. If the music is good, it's good, I just don't want to end up considering Britney Spears as good music. I guess the hypocrisy lies in the fact that I try so hard to be the opposite of people who oppose everything that I've become an "anti" too. If you've ever seen  SLC Punk , you'll realize that all of this is very similar. By the way, sorry about the complaining, I've tried to avoid bitching ever since I left LiveJournal (http://www.livejournal.com/) since that's all that seems to be on there, people bitching about their horrible american lives, but I wrote this to use myself as an example as there are many others in the same situation that don't even know it yet.  I've come to the conclusion that all fifteen year olds love the movie  SLC Punk . What a waste. As proof, view my profile, click on the link "SLC Punk" and just look at how old all of the bloggers are who like the movie too. Besides, aren't they too young to watch it anyway?

      Wow, I need a bigger erection and horny housewives right now. No one has a bigger sex drive than me. I mean, who wouldn't want a Scandonavian secretary at your fingertips? Ugh, does anyone get as much junk email about Austrian sluts or refinancing my mailbox from great friends like Jordan, Amelie, Jamie, Ashley, Blaine, Jordan, Brian, Loraine, and all of the rest of my long lost friends. I'm so glad they care so much about my sex life and the car I don't have. I think one of my friends decided that it would be funny to sign me up for a bunch of these porn newsletters.

      Wired (http://www.wired.com/) is a magazine published on a monthly basis, dating back to March 1993, and is based mostly on technology and how it effects the world. It's a great magazine as it always has been except for what I've noticed recently. For one, there has been a major cut down in the size of the magazine and second, the magazine seems more based on technology companies rather technology itself. None of this has been immediate but a gradual stepdown to what seems to me, a lower quality magazine. I've pulled out all of the Wired magazines I own (except for the ones my brother has stoled and is keeping in Tempe), dating from January 2000 to the latest, June 2004. The issue  Millenium-Free Zone  (January 2000) has a page number count of two hundred forty-eight but the issue  Fast Forward  (December 2000) has a page number count of four hundred eighteen. In two thousand two Wired got a make over in an attempt to appeal to a larger crowd. Dave Weber, who runs the Management of Technology program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests Wired "may be guilty of 'jack of all trades and master of none disease." Wired's own Chris Anderson said "Wired has become less evangelical, less political ... less about looking at the subcultures and more looking at technology's effect all around us." at a redesign promotion. No more twelve page articles on the idea of growing massive amounts of ocean plankton with the vitamin Fe to solve the issue of global warming or pushing the acceleration on a roller coaster from zero to eighty in one and eight-tenths of a second. Today, I'm reading articles on Peter Jackson, the director of  The Lord of the Rings , and what the great features of Google are and how to use them. There are exceptions to these issues but Wired just isn't what is used to be, it's not "out there." Will my subscription be renewed? We'll all see in December.  Oh by the way, in the words of Ryan Adams I say "Note to self, don't die."

      I know that I'm one of the last ones to, but I saw Lost In Translation last night. Damn, what a good movie. What do you say about it? Everything about it is great. There was no point in the film that was hard or painful to watch and I enjoyed every gosh dang second of it. It's weird how I like this movie so much and don't have anything to rave about but the movie itself. I guess there is no scene that is better than the previous and I could say without blinking, that every scene in this movie was magnificent. Or maybe I'm not raving because it's a love story and that automatically makes it a chick flick, just kidding.  I've thought about this a lot, and with no narcicism involved, I think I could be considered a genius in any random date B.C. Of course there are lots of people that are more intelligent and wittier than I am, I think I am the bare minimum.  I finally got my permit, started driving and that's all I'm going to say.

      Other than my broskey, does anyone else know about Carina Round? She’s got this amazing band from Europe (an automatic plus) and it’s just purely good music. Her music isn’t exactly anything cutting edge but it isn’t like anything else I know. I can’t exactly put my thumb on why the only thing I’ve listened to is her latest record, The Disconnection, for the last seven days. I read an article from the London Times about her and somehow she is not very popular in her homeland except for a small group of hardcore fans (family?). It’s not like I like this music just because it’s a little different from what’s out there right there (I mean people are still listening to that song “Meant to Live” by Switchfoot) but there’s something about her music. Maybe it’s her very soft and diverse voice that blends into the music like a Manta Ray slipping into the ocean floor. Or the off beats of the drumsticks hitting the snare to give the music a jazzier feel. Maybe the real five-foot bass that gives the music that real authentic feel. I often find myself rocking my head, which is something I’ve definitely been trying to avoid for a while. It is a little on the dark side and definitely not all that poppy. I’m glad she’s getting popular, I guess, (she’s already been on MTV once or twice) but hopefully she’ll latch to a darker crowd like the Donnie Darko movie.   The Donnie Darko movie is going to be re-released, I’m not sure when or if it already has, but it’s coming out. I like the movie, it is good, but is it really that good? It seems that a lot of kids my age have adopted the movie as their favorite. I remember asking my peers at the beginning of the school year if they had even heard of the movie. Usually, I would just get a puzzled look of confusion for not asking about Bad Boys II. Is it annoying or aggravating? It wouldn’t be if they could understand but it’s good that a new and a much bigger crowd will be experiencing something very new, something very demented. I think that’s the thing that got the movie its newfound popularity, teenagers being able to identify with a hallucinogenic psychotic. I’m not going to go ranting about SUV’s, McDonalds, and how rich we are but god damn, us teens need to fucking suck it up.

      Being here in San Francisco and in California in general is giving me motivation to do something I never thought I would come close to doing. I want to learn a couple new languages. I say this as easily as someone saying "I want to start breathing." But I think it would a great quality for anyone. Especially Japanese, knowing that would probably give anyone a jumpstart into the business world.   Well, in researching teaching resources I came upon the website So You Want To Learn Japanese ... (http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~thoureau/japanese.html) which is a very funny site. Even if you have no interest whatsoever in the Japanese language, check it out.   The thing is, in California there are even more Asian tourists than cyclists. Back in Arizona, we don't have much diversity. We have us and reptiles. I already know some Spanish and would not be that difficult to continue and become fluent in. But seriously, think of the possibilities that could be opened to you if you were multilingual other than avoiding being ripped off on paying for everything while traveling. I'm thinking learning an Asian language would most definitely get anyone a high and secure position for any job. Also, if you get hired for that quality, it'll be most likely that you'll be a translator or doing international business which means you'll be getting to travel internationally on your company's tab. Of course, none of this is exactly brand new stuff. But it's all pretty cool and in the end, I would finally be able to watch anime and know what's going on.

      So, in another attempt to add and diversify blog readers, I've stumbled through many LiveJournal journals. After, the fifty seventh one, it comes to me. Not all LiveJournal users are pre-pubescent teenagers. Well, okay, I knew that already but it also surprised me that a lot of the users were in their late twenties and older. I read a couple of the older journals and to no difference between teens and these older people, all of them except for one were still about drinking, smoking while drinking, and working while smoking and drinking. Not only that, but a lot of them seem to mention moving into the suburbs recently or how they will soon. The thought of being twenty five and living in (over used term) a cookie cutter house is one that gives me the chills. The exception to these journals was a woman named Lisa who still part takes in those activities but also exercises and keeps fit while managing to obtain scholarships to finance her hiatus to France. I'm not trying to bash LiveJournal since it's the users that seem to be so lame. I just think LiveJournal will be a very handy tool for motivation when it is most needed.     I also added a new link to my sidebar. It'll direct you to Mr. Maddox's web page, The Best Page In The Universe, and no, there aren't any quotation marks missing because it's a fact that it is the best.

      Why can't people be "cool"? Although I'm not the best example, they're have been some real "non-cool" people that I've encountered. Being "cool" isn't that hard. It's a word that's been used so much and for so long that it's harder to not be described by it than ingesting Crazy Jerry's Brain Damage Hot Sauce (http://www.americanspice.com/catalog/item-50361.html).     Yet, some people still manage to act so atrociously that they don't fit into the five mile wide grey area set by the word cool. Some people are the jerks, the stupid know-it-alls who answer all of the questions with all of the wrong answers, the clever ones, and some are all wrapped into one. I won't go into any descriptions because we all have or will deal with these people at one point or another in our lives. What I would like to do is make a brochure, for the "un-cool". It will have all of the pointers on how to shut up and tips like how to open a door for a woman and locations to the closest discreet clinics. I'm already working very hard on the brochure but what I need from you all are the actual content and a very diverse street team who will spread the word. Please send me feedback at my new email address (luike2@yahoo.com) since as I have mentioned before, I'm not the greatest example of "coolness".  Until I get some feedback, here are some business cards to print and hand out.     By the way, one of the random questions that we're given on our profiles was "How would you live like a frog?". Here's my answer (it was too long for the box). I would live it like a regular frog, eating flies, burping, killing curious children with my poisonous skin, and pulling in money for the syndicated Budweiser commercials. It's like asking a frog how it would live as a human. It'd be normal, like the rest of us. When people say they would hate to live as a frog or fish, it's a dumb time for them. Assuming they start over as a frog or fish, they wouldn't remember their past human life, would have nothing to compare their current fly eating to, and therefore would have no reason to be sad, and there would be no notion of anything wrong except when the vibration from the semis come rolling down the road.
