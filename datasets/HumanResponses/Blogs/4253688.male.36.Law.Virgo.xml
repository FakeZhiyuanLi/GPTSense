      I wouldn't know and I don't care because I drive a cheap LPG-powered (and less polluting might I add) car, but I hear that a lot of people are up in arms about the price of petrol in this country.  Please, give me a break!  Australia has had, and still has, amongst the cheapest petrol of any developed nation, except the USA.  A quick survey of petrol prices across Europe, for example, reveals that Greece had the cheapest at about 90 Euro cents (thats about A$1.59) and the dearest was the Netherlands - 1.25 Euros per litre which is a whopping A$2.20 or so!  Quite apart from the short-term economic effect of rising petrol prices on the economy, it might - hopefully - finally force people and industry in this country to look for alternatives despite John Howard's pitiful suppport for such R & D.  The Netherlands is an interesting comparison, a country of similar population (20 million), yet they seem to cope perfectly all right with a petrol price of $2.20/litre and remain extremely prosperous.  It can be done; it just needs vision.  But vision requires that one stops moaning and opens one's eyes.  I'm still waiting for Australia to do that.

      So, whats this "Zeitgeist" thing? What's he on about? Who does he think he is?  OK, first things first.  "Zeitgeist" (along with "schadenfreude: malicious delight in other's misfortunes" and "angst") is one of those fantastic words we can thank those Germans for giving to the English language.  German, always striving for perfection and profoundity, does sometimes throw up some great concepts that, to keep true to their underlying philosophy and meaning, really should only ever be expressed in their original form.    "Zeit" is German for "time", "Geist" means "spirit", or in some contexts, "ghost" (as in "Poltergeist").  But like most Germanic compound nouns, put them together and you get a remarkable synergy of meaning that goes way beyond the simplistic "time spirit".    So, what   DO   we get?  I suppose since the word really is expressing an abstract concept it is difficult to pin down its exact meaning, but in a broad sense it can mean "the spirit of the times (or age, or era)".  In a philosophical sense, as far as the present day goes, "der Zeitgeist" asks: "Whats going on here and now, with the way people think and act, and why?", it poses the question "What drives the underlying mores of the society we live in today" or even just "Where are we now?".  It may be trite to say "to understand where we are going we need to know where we have been" but the current Zeitgeist is intrinsically a collection of past and present which makes us what we are. It kind of makes Bill Gates patheic attempt - Where do you want to go today? - appear all the more superficial.  I hope to make you think; provoke you, inspire you, hell, even irritate you sometimes.  But thats all good. "der Zeitgeist" wouldn't have it any other way.
