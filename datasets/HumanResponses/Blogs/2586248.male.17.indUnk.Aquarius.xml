      Hey, I uploaded the roll that I shot at Georgetown IR last week. Some fun pictures and I took a bunch of Avi for some reason. He's so photogenic. You can get them at  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/lazybum99 .&nbsp;However, the collection of pictures is nothing compared to the one Marco has with Ireney. His collection is at:  urlLink http://countyseat.net/marco/Gallery/Georgetown/index.htm    Here's one of Marco and Ireney dancing, as Jinnyn's brother looks on in bewilderment:   .   &nbsp;  Classic.

      I thought Bill Clinton's speech was absolutely terrific (of course). He hit on all the right points and wore the same tie that I have. Check out  urlLink http://www.dems2004.org  for videos, and definitely check out Ted Kennedy's also. Bush-bashing supposedly discouraged? Psssh. Edwards will be great tonight, I'm sure, and I was just watching Kerry in Charlestown Navy Yard, on his way to the convention. I'm at work until nine tonight, so I have catch the convention online (streaming live) at the site above. I hope I don't bother the patrons too much.  I realize that all conventions are basically mutual-admiration societies, but for the Democrats, that hasn't always been an easy task. However, everyone from George Mitchell to Gephardt to Brokaw is saying that they have never seen the party so united. I've always believed that a more united Democratic base (moreso than a united Republican base) will help the candidate prevail.  Oh, and how about Barack Obama! Check an AP story out at  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-CVN-Obama-Keynote.html &nbsp;if you've never heard of him (DON'T FORGET-- registering for the New York Times is always free and most definitely worth it!) He's another idol of mine in the Democratic Party. Check him out.

      Gmail is an outstanding email service, and not just because it's provided by Google. It gives you an entire 1 GB of storage (1000 MB), allowing you to exchange music, large attachments, etc. with each other. It's worth it -- it's not directly open to the public yet, but I have five invitations left. If you would like one, IM me or email me.   http://gmail.google.com

      There is a real problem in Sudan right now-- it goes beyond the classification of problem and since the United States is of a more indifferent attitude to issues irrelevant to direct national security, most people don't know and thus the government is less hesitant. Criticize Clinton for failing to act in Rwanda (which is wholly justified as I hope all people realize), but don't sit back now and watch the people of Darfur hopelessly crumble in another genocide. Read more about it at The New York Times, one of the few media players that is extensively covering this tragedy:  - Here are stories in the past month--  urlLink http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=darfur&amp;date=past30days  - Nicholas Kristof's personal accounts--  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2004/07/06/opinion/20040707_KRIS_1.html   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I found out about this organization while at Boys State. Although they kinda stole an idea I had (I'm sure unintentionally), they promote young voter awareness across the country. Although they won't state it, it inevitably supports a Democratic viewpoint-- but check them out at  urlLink http://www.freedomsanswer.net .   They do good work and it's real easy to get involved.

      Hey everyone,  Yes, this is my new blog -- considering the last one was kind of neglected, I just decided to start up another one. I'll try to keep it up to date, add tidbits, but not commit to writing a lot everyday, just when I see fit.   I just got back from Georgetown IR program and I'll be posting some pictures, hopefully later today. Boys State was great, and that was in early July. The Marines -- crazy. Tonight is the third night of the convention, and John Edwards is speaking tonight. You can probably tell that for the next hundred days or so, my blog will be consumed with election news. I'll stick this in my AIM profile, let me know what you think, if you have any suggestions, and if you were at Georgetown IR, sned some mor epictures-- Courtney, that means you! And Marco, stick this on your site man. (Marco is absolutely one of the coolest guys I have ever met, check out his website at countyseat.net/marco/home.html)   If you need the notes from Georgetown IR, thank Edward first (philo4audio) and then go to  urlLink http://itg.no-ip.org . Thank God for Edward -- the notes will definitely help in your history/gov't class. Alright, until later when I stick up the photos, have a good day.

      The convention just ended and here's my opinion on the speech:  It was as good as John Kerry could give it-- he's no Bill Clinton, but he's not a George W. Bush either. He spoke from his heart, from his mind, and gave his vision to this nation. And he makes me proud to be a Democrat.   If you want reactions from around the world, from newspapers from here to Thailand, check out  urlLink this.

      Avi aka Avinash aka reeeeally slow walker  Here is Avi, on the left, with Marco:    As you can tell from the picture, Avi is a rather fun-loving guy. He likes having fun--whether it's blowing his mouth up and holding up two fingers or stalking people, Avi is a great guy. Interesting, yet absurdly true, story:  First day in Georgetown. We, as a group of about seven or eight, are walking down M Street. Two people on bicylces are heading towards us. Everyone moves over, to let them pass. Except Avi. The first person on the bike, a black woman, is dangerously approaching. Avi, apparently now recognizing that there will be a crash if he does not move, dashingly throws out his hands, puts them on the lady's handlebars, and says defiantly but oddly nonchalantly, "Stop."  Avi can also trick you, as Marco found out-- first afternoon in Georgetown. They go to play basketball. Marco hardly plays, and he doesn't know much about Avi yet. Avi suggests they play Horse, and promptly misses every practice shot. Marco gains confidence, thinking, "All right, I can handle this dude." Game begins. Avi promptly swishes every shot.  I hope this gives you an idea about Avi -- he's a great guy who listens sort of, likes to fool around, always has a lot of fun, and appears to me like a bonafide Southern guy-- he is from North Carolina. To his enormous credit, John Edwards is, or was, his Senator.  Avi, I hope you enjoyed this.  Rahul

      As most of you know, I spent the week from July 18 to the 25th at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, for an international relations program. It exceeded my expectations--it was much more academic than I thought it would be (thus more preferable to my liking), yet also practical. I recommend it for any junior who wants to study IR or go to Georgetown SFS.  Some notable moments included (other than friends, which I'll get to)-- - Meeting Bob Gallucci, Clinton's ambassador-at-large and lead negotiator of the 1994 Agreed Framework with the DPRK. He signed my copy of his book, "Going Critical." - Learning from Professor Arend... by far, the most engaging lecturer I've ever met. - Being asked by Prof. Taylor for my thoughts on GMOs and Zambia's response to US food aid. - Seeing John Kerry's house. ... and a lot others.  As for friends, there were too many for me to possibly think of them at this time, and I'll inevitably miss someone or some story. Please stick it in the comments section if I do.  Courtney, Anastasia (who I immediately recognized as a "city girl" and promptly added that it was a compliment), Danielle, and Meredith-- otherwise known as the "pinkies" for their inadvertent clothes-matching. They seemed to hang out together a bunch. Actually, a LOT. We went to Clyde's with them, Urban Outfitters (well, they shopped while we played x box), Uno, and hung out with them.  Marco and Avi. Two of the coolest guys I've ever met. Marco's from Indiana, and had to battle the stigma of being from, literally, the middle of nowhere. Avi, as you read in his spotlight page, is from North Carolina-- John Edwards country, woo! Funny story-- we walk into Foot Locker on M Street, while the girls went to Polo Ralph Lauren. It's Avi's idea, he said he wants to look at some sneakers. He glances at the sneakers. Looks around. Walks towards the back of the store and starts perusing through the socks. Courtney calls, asks what we're doing. I tell her the truth-- Marco and I are standing around, while Avi browses through socks.  The guys from Northern New Jersey (I capitalized northern because it's really different from anywhere else in the state): Patrick, Alex, Brian, and Ben. All pretty cool, except Patrick, early in the program, seemed to become rather agitated very easily. But, he came around. Alex and Ben go to Millburn high school, which oddly enough, is where Schenker's good friend, Meredith, goes as well. They were very cool-- we actually went to a meeting with a Dean of SFS (who's in charge of the I-pol program) and talked about the school and admissions tips, and just Georgetown in general. I've been in touch with Patrick, but haven't been able to get a hold of Alex or Ben.   Isabel (or Izzy, I'm not sure what to call her:), Grace, and Channing. My buddies from Seattle, WA. Actually, Edmonds, WA, which I've heard of, but apparently most people haven't. I asked a bunch of questions about Starbucks, which is evidently better in WA than anywhere else (makes sense), how it's rainy all the time (or seems to be), and Bill Gates. We went to Clyde's together (well, not Channing), but I was surprised that Grace actually ate (had French dip), instead of most girls who just eat half a lettuce leaf. Isabel was in my discussion group and was adamantly in support of bombing North Korea, if it came to that. I had to admire that tenacity. Channing is one smart dude -- wants to go to Harvard or MIT, and I won't be surprised at all if he ends up at one of those places. Grace has never been to New York and I told her she, Isabel, and Channing should come to check out the schools and I'd show them all around. We went to Paolo's together too (except Isabel) on the last day, and it was very enjoyable.  And how could I forget, the counselors-- Gregg. He answered my millions of questions about admissions and continues to do so.   Chrissy. Took Marco and me out on a date to Thomas Sweet... I'll never forget the cookie dough ice cream covered in hot fudge, priceless night (and she's a LI girl too!).   John. Italian, I assume, from the Bronx and loooves Indian girls. Just a great, fun guy, and I'm taking him up on his offer to visit him this fall. I'll never forget him walking around barefoot and his advice on life and what it really means to be cool.  Jinnyn! She ran the program, and what a job-- she didn't talk about Turkey (too much), ran our discussions efficiently, and is just a great person in general.  There are so many other people to write about (including Chip n Dale and their short shorts... although I think Jay and Nick were great guys), and of course, Bridget with her Nemo look! Precious. And definitely, Franceso and his Peruvian, "Ah you're so hot right now." But, I would be writing forever. If I left something particularly important or noteworthy out, please let me know and stick in the comments section or tell me. I appreciate it.  I loved the experience at Georgetown and the people I met were a big part of that... and I'll never forget them.  Take care, Rahul

      - Note: Go to Previous Posts to check out the Georgetown IR post and pictures.  Since my school starts exactly one month from now, I thought it would be good if I laid out my plan for August. I've started reading one of the required books-- "In a Different Voice" by Carol Gilligan. Most think that it's quite boring, but I like it. One, it's very revealing and very applicable. Second, I loved AP Psychology and if you haven't taken the course, it's a little harder to grasp. The other book, by Toni Morrison, is "The Bluest Eye"-- I haven't read it, but I've heard much about it. Besides, Toni Morrison is one of my favorite people, even if I haven't read any of her books yet-- she's the one who called Bill Clinton the "first black President." For the other section of books, I chose authors Graham Greene ("Our Man in Havana," which is supposed to be very good) and Richard Wright ("Clara Callan," which looks very interesting). But in the meantime, while I haven't been reading those, when I say I'm reading on my away message, it usually entails Robert Dallek's "Unfinished Life" about JFK, Gilligan's book, and "Diplomacy" by Henry Kissinger. This August, I hope to start "Going Critical" by Bob Gallucci and "Six Wives of Henry VIII" by David Starkey.  This week, we're planning on a little reunion among the Gtown IR buddies in the area, since Marco is coming to New York for the first time. Get to me if you need to know the time, place (AIM: lazybum99). It should be a lot of fun, and if you have any particular ideas about what to do, let us know. John is definitely coming and I hope Chrissy is too... two of the coolest people I know, in addition to Patrick, Courtney, and the guys from northern NJ.  A couple of days after that, I'll be going up to Dartmouth on a minority recruitment trip. I don't know why I'm going, considering I'm Indian and they don't benefit from affirmative action in college admissions (because, as a group, we're overrepresented in the top college population compared to our population in the US). But, I guess they didn't want to seem as too exclusive by inviting blacks, Native Americans, and hispanics, so they invited Asians as well. Nonetheless, they're paying for everything, so it should be fun. I hope being in the middle of nowhere isn't as boring as it sounds (I should ask Marco about that:).  I will be working throughout this month, at the library, so when my profile doesn't come up sometimes or I don't appear to be online even though I'm signed on, it's probably because I'm at work between 5 and 9. It's a nice job, and Irfaan should be returning soon. I've also got to start the work for AP Government and Biology, although I don't think it will be too bad. Might even be a little bit of fun to get back into the swing of things. I can't believe that it's senior year already. It goes by fast, doesn't it?  Well, I've got to go read something, have breakfast/brunch, so I'll catch ya later.  Take care, Rahul

      Check out the Georgetown stuff, under Previous stuff, if you haven't already.  Hmm... well, I suppose it would be time to discuss my future plans and what I plan on doing, instead of answering the same question over and over.  Where do you want to go? -  urlLink Georgetown University , School of Foreign Service. The best school for undergraduate international relations in the United States.  urlLink Columbia , for the political science and location.  urlLink Dartmouth , for the excellent Government program.  urlLink Emory , for being in Atlanta and for, well, being Emory. The  urlLink University of Chicago  for its intense academics. Throw in  urlLink NYU  and  urlLink Notre Dame  as well.  What do you want to study? - International relations preferably, or political science/government.  Big city or small town? - Big city, with the exception of Dartmouth because it's Dartmouth.  Why not Harvard? - Because Harvard undergrad is overrated and it's not in DC.  What do you want to be when you grow up? - Serving in government, maybe State Department or some other internationally-inclined organization (UN, IMF, World Bank, etc.).  Any advice? - Yeah, start thinking about colleges. It's less than 90 days to the EA/ED deadline.  Good luck!

      Don't forget to check out "Georgetown IR" and "Pictures" in the Previous Posts section if you haven't already.  I'm in the middle of watching West Wing on Bravo, so this will be brief. I added a MSN Money stock quote search (scroll down, on your right), and already put CAKE in the search field so you can see how my favorite stock is doing. Melissa said she had Carol Gilligan as a professor at NYU and I thought that was so cool--I'm liking "In a Different Voice" very much.  If you haven't already, check out  urlLink http://www.jibjab.com , it's an absolutely hilarious mini-movie about Bush and Kerry.  I have work later today, at 5, but I'll be around until then. Friday, for everyone coming, the meeting time is 11:30 and then we'll hang around in Times Square, and then head up to the Upper West Side. Ben'll meet us up there, he gets out of his Columbia class at 3:30. Chrissy is going to let me know if she can come, she'll probably come for a part of the afternoon.  Alright take care,  Rahul

       urlLink    Yes, Avi is wearing my cap and listening to someone else's iPod.  urlLink     I've never met such a shameless self-promoter. We need more people like that.  True story:  Avi is walking with Alex at Georgetown. Walking on the sidewalk. You see, Georgetown's maintenance staff has these cool golf carts that putter around the campus. Anyway, back to the story. Alex and Avi are walking. Alex and Avi see golf cart moving towards them. Alex moves to the side, to avoid being hit by the golf cart. Makes sense, right? Not in Avi's world. He stays in his path. Golf cart man sees Avi. Golf cart swerves to avoid hitting our favorite Southerner, instead smashing the flower bush on the side.  Another true story:  This one, I actually feel sympathy for Avi. He's playing soccer and a guy tries to tackle him, digging his cleats into his shin. Ouch. Avi thinks it's just minor, a sprain of some sort, so he's not worried. He goes out and plays some basketball for a while. That minor sprain turns out to be something major. Avi goes to Doctor. Doctor says Avi has a clot in his shin and that's why it's swelling like it broke. Hurricane (or Tropical Storm) Alex is heading up the coast, making some nice waves. Avi, Indian with clotted shin and all, wants to go out and surf. Now that's a story worthy of John Kerry. Go Avi!  I know I mentioned Avi's a stalker. Well, he's not. Sort of.  Take care Avi,  Rahul

       urlLink    Stephanie   Hey guys, since I did a couple of posts on Avi (a friend from outside of school), I thought I'd let people who don't go to BSHS know one of my friends from school.   That's Stephanie, on the left, in Boston actually. She was there on a highly prestigious ballet program, and they've actually asked her to stay-- to show you how down to earth she is, she doesn't think of being a ballerina full-time one day, maybe a doctor. She loooved Boston. And who wouldn't during the Democratic National Convention? She got to meet Bill Clinton and then... ate at the Cheesecake Factory! Which, ironically, is the same thing I did when I met him two and a half years ago. She did comment that it was much like a "Rahul day." Ahh, there are a lot of things you could talk about concerning Stephanie. For one, she's a relatively straight arrow-- meaning she doesn't drink or smoke or anything like that (Avi, you should learn). Hmm... she has this torquoise skirt, which is not one of those crazy mini fluttery ones these days, but a very cool and unique one. She bought a car with her own money -- a Honda Civic, right? The color's magnesium, which I didn't know was some kind of silverish, brownish color. In any case, besides being pretty, she's smart too! She can hold her own in a discussion about politics or current events annnd her dad is totally cool. Her parents teach at St. Joseph's College (in Brooklyn?) and, incidentally, Bill Clinton went there on his first visit to New York in the 1960s. Since I'm reading "My Life," I thought I'd add that. She's related to everyone -- Susan Lucci and the guy who thwarted the British-planned three prong attack (Burgoyne's Blunder) in upstate NY during the Revolutionary War (did I get it right?). No wonder our history teacher, Mr. Friedman, loves her. She shares my love of cheesecake and cities. And she's got nieces too (ask her about her family tree someday), one of which just got married.   As you can tell, Stephanie's one of those unique people you meet during life and it's been good knowing her.   Rahul  &nbsp; urlLink

      Yesterday was probably the single most enjoyable day of the summer. A bunch of us from the Georgetown IR program in the area (northern NJ, LI) got together in the form of a little reunion and welcoming party for Marco, from Indiana on his first visit to the city. Well, my day began quite early, before anyone else's. I got up at 6:15 am and took the 7:00 am train to Penn Station, arriving at 7:40. It only took me about ten minutes to get to Times Square and I chilled out a little. I walked over to Bryant Park, got a New York Times, and sat in front of the Wall Street Journal's offices. I called Marco, asking him where the hell was his hotel, and walked over and met him and his great family outside McDonald's-- his mom, dad, and 13 year old brother. We all proceeded to the Bryant Park subway station and, if I wasn't there to assist them at the MetroCard station, they might still be there.  We went down to NYU for an information session and tour. Marco wanted to check out the school and I had never been on the session/tour. So, we went and unfortunately had the luck of getting a girl from Orange County, California, who laughed when talking about LGBT club ("Hey, we also haave a LGBT club, did you know that?! Hehe, Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender club. Hehe." ::giggle:giggle::) If I want girls like that, I can just stay at home and there are plenty on Long Island. Nonetheless, the tour was useless but I liked the session. I'm considering NYU, it's on the list.  We headed uptown after the session at around 11:35. We were supposed to meet everyone at 11:30 in front of Marco's hotel. We kind of ran off from his parents and took the A (I think?) to the Port Authority station. We jogged/walked two blocks west and almost got hit by trucks. I thought the light had turned red. So, I started walking. It actually turned green. So, I started running. We eventually met up with everyone: John, Chrissy, Alex, Patrick, Courtney, and Brian. We kind of hung around, went to Marco's room and admired the view. We had devised a plan, so we started to head uptown-- visiting the American Museum of Natural History, where John had worked in high school. He gave us a thoroughly unenlightening tour. We went to Central Park, which was quite fun-- but before that, we got some hot dogs and Marco had his first New York dirty water hot gdog. Courtney was still hungry, so it was her luck when we passed by a picnic and they offered us free food. Nice people. We saw the boat lake, with its green and muddy water, and then went to the place in Home Alone where Culkin gets into the carriage. John continued to provide us life lessons, namely "don't burn your bridges."  We went up to Columbia after that, and met Ben. However, he was running a little late and Marco had never seen the campus, so I gave an impromptu tour that was thoroughly enlightening. In my best admissions staff persona, I showed the library, dorm halls, main quad, etc. We passed by actual tours of over forty people and I would loudly say something like, "We are now passing by the Hartley wiffleball field. You will see patches of dirt, representing the pitcher's mound, and the flowers are where the catcher squats. They often have to replace the flowers." We went into John Jay dining hall, at John's suggestion after I mentioned the "beautiful, wooden cafeteria," where he checked the soda machine by pushing the lever. Soda came out. John was happy. He found a cup, got some soda, then got some ice cream too. His justification?: "I'm sure Columbia can spot me some ice cream and soda." We proceeded out of the dining hall, walking past an actual tour group that was just entering. I pointed out, "Please notice the computers that are prsent in all hallways, providing fast T1 connections."  After our little tour, we went out to 116th and looked for a restaurant. I actually saw my RA from the Columbia program, Mike Kwon, in a grocery store and I was so glad to have seen him. We went over to the West End, where we had a very nice lunch.  After lunch, John suggested we see Union Square. So, we went all the way downtown again. But, it was definitely worth it -- we had a black guy dressed like an 18th century Englishman, with a cane and tophat and all, (eerily looking like Jeffrey the butler from "Fresh Prince") sing Marco a Hebrew song. We all chipped in for the donation. And, then! Courtney ran after a "6 foot 7 Jew who will freestyle rap" (a cardboard sign one of the members of his entourage was holding) who was, in fact, Jesus from Short Hills, NJ. He immediately came over and rapped for us. With his overflowing hair and facial hair, coupled with the white flowing shirt and pants (that had a huge hole, allowing us to notice that he had blue boxers on), he was Jesus. He freestyled rap something, whatever came to his mind and ended with something like, "Duck duck goose, duck duck goose..." We caught him later, feverishly waving his arms about, miraculously healing a boy standing before him. I don't think I've ever spent free time with friends that was quite as interesting as that.  We went up to Times Square after that and took Marco to the huge Virgin Megastore. John, Ben, Brian, and I were so tired we just sat down in one of the aisles while the others looked for music. We went to Coldstone Creamery, which Chrissy said was quite good, although John and I got split off from the group for a few minutes. We went and all of us, except Chrissy (who had a dinner with an ex -bf at 9:30) and John, got something-- I got Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake Chill, or something to that effect. I gave them a tip and the whole staff started singing, it was cool.  We broke up soon after that. I told Marco to give me a call before he left New York and I will surely miss John's lessons. But, I will take his advice, not to burn any bridges with him or the others. The guys from northern NJ want to put together a trip to Six Flags, but I don't know if I can make that this month. I hope Chrissy had a great time on her dinner date thing and, if I get to Georgetown, I want to see her again and probably before that.  Courtney knows that I was rushing to get to my train. But, I'm glad I stayed for the ice cream and for a goodbye that will probably be the last one for some time, especially to Marco (except online of course). I missed that train. But, you know what? It was worth it.
