        I pick a daisy,     gently, carefully, it might just break if i'm not careful.&nbsp;&nbsp; i cup it in my hand, the yellow in the middle reflects the sun, the white petal so clean and fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp; the sky above me broods with grey and white clouds in turmoil, strangely, the sun is never covered... it starts to rain, still the sun covers me, so long as i hold onto my daisy.        &nbsp;    don't crush the daisies while you're walking through the garden...

        looking out the window, i see a one-lane road winding through the hills for a km or so before it disappears around a bend... further, i see hills, trees, and finaley a small patch of ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking about that beach i can almost tase the salt spray, feel the ocean breeze on my face, smell the same aromas that have circled there since as long as i can remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; that's the beach i lived across the road from, the place i where i lived longer then anywhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 years might not sound like a long time, but other then there, i've never lived anywhere longer then 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 year if i was lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp; the sky start to lighten to a shade of yellow, slowly darkening to midnight blue, and i wonder why i would ever want to leave.

         Ya know, I never thought about what i'd do if an earthquake struck... then it happened, just the other day... and yesterday... and today... the whole house is swaying at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; what fun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

         earlier this morning, on the way in to church, i drove past the one bedroom cottage my family was living in when i was born... the same house i pass nearly every day.   as we neared it, the acrid smell of smoke penetrated the car.   i rounded the corner, the house came into veiw.   it had been derelict for so may years, someone had been squating there for the night, carelessly set fire to it.   almost the whole house, or what was left of it had become no more then ashes.   an empty shell now longer, what's left standing will be demolished with some great machinery, soon there will be no sign of the coop that held the livelyhood of a family in it's stead.    in the safety of the car, i drove right past it; just as it's life is over, so will my time of refuge be dismembered.
