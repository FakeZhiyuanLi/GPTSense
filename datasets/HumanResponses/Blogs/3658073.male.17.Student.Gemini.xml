      Hey... it's me here. I heard about these "blogs" a while ago, and after finding one on accident today (of a guy I've heard of), and I figured this would be a good way to express my thoughts and feelings to... just something. Maybe if I brush up on communication here, I'll get better with speaking in real life (yeah, right...). But I look forward to jotting my feelings down, so later in life, I can look back on what I had done.  That is all... and by all means, don't lose focus.

      I love my church- First Baptist Church Henderson.  Our pastor, Jere Wilson, is fantastic- he's a man of God, his sermons are well-planned, easy to understand, and they really connect with you.  Chuck Hawkins, our music minister, is a true joy- I've never seen him act negatively about anything; he's a devoted (and humorous) guy.  Mike Dietz, our Missions minister, might be considered "boring" when he speaks, but his passion for missions is astounding- our church has been all over the world- Mexico, the Ukraine, China, you name it.  Plus, our members in general are very friendly, loving people.   The youth group, aka the "Cause," has become one of the highlights of my week. Frank Teat, the youth minister, is extremely devoted to all of the youth in so many ways; I once disliked him, but the more I've gotten to know him and his passion for teens, he's become an outstanding leader and man of God in my eyes.   Praise God for Sundays and Wednesdays so we can all fellowship and worship! (And for other days of the week... my devotional life is growing immensely)  ***  Today, July 4, Independence Day... we're not doing anything today. Church was very patriotic, I guess you could say, and Bro. Jere preached from 2 Chronicles 7:14 ("If My people, who are called by My name..."). It was all wonderful, as usual.  Lunch was leftover grilled chicken and rice (yum).   Australia called... wanted me to come over. I said my family was going somewhere in a couple of hours... which I don't think we are. I really don't like Aus., but I suppose they think I do. Maybe Aus. just doesn't realize that I value someone who has a strong, evident relationship with Christ over someone that's just kind of cool. I really need to witness to Aus. more...  Well, I don't know what the afternoon or evening holds, so I guess I'll just... chill out. No church tonight :(   Seattle talked last week about getting some people together to go eat at J'Tree and hang out... maybe. I'll look into that...  That's all I have to say for today... but above all, don't lose focus.
