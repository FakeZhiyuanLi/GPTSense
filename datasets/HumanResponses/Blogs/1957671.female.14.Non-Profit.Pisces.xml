      okay so mandi is a bitch as we all know. yeah well that's okay cause i looked so much better than her in a bikini that it's not even funny. but yeha kristin's party was awesome. the pool was freezing especially right after the hot tub but i had jake to keep me warm. so that was cool. fucking mom making me go to her fucking church today when i don't wanna hear some buddhist crap because i'm not a fucking buddhist. why can't she just respect me and what i believe? and if i don't go then i can't do anything with friends for the rest of the fucking weekend. AHHHH i wish my mom would just die.

      alright so the dinner dance was totally AWESOME. everyone looked awesome. and i admit that i looked alright. food was alright. dancing with jake was awesome. fast and slow. kekeke. katie and ben were so cute!!! i can't get over it. alright so here's my mastercard.  dress-$100 shoes to match-$30 jewelery-$20 hair done-$70 nails done-$12 having a truely memorable night with the guy you love-priceless  went to friendlys after the dance. that was funny. jake was of course the only guy. what else is new? we all had fun though taking random pictures and me trying to get a sugar high. i think i was too high on life though to get one. so yeah. going to a picnic on base today. before that going bowling with my family. i don't want this weekend to end...EVER. it's been so awesome and yeah. i love you jaCOB!!!

      yes this is my new blog. my freedom blog where i can write what i want and how i feel. i'm not sure if i'll be giving out the link and if i do it won't be to just anyone. so yeah mr cooper had to talk to jake today because of his blog (wtf?). so yeah now jake's parents know about what we have done and they aren't too happy about it. so all trust in jake and i is gone. how...terrible. so yeah we're never allowed in his room alone anymore. come on though it's not like we did anything that could ruin either of our lives. i really don't give a damn about my reputation. i remember in 6th grade guidance class when we did character vs. reputation. your reputation is what people THINK you are. i couldn't care less about who other people THINK i am. your character is who you are. i care more for that. if people don't like it then oh well i'll get over it i'm sure. i don't care what my classmates, mr cooper, my parents. i do kind of care what jake's parents think but that's just cause i hate it when other people's parents hate me. so yeah i'm going to write whatever i want in here because MR. COOPER I DON'T GIVE A DAMN. i don't even see why it was any of his business and why he called jake down. it's not like he threatened to kill everyone in our school in his blog. it's not like he's doing drugs. yeah ya know why mr cooper cared? cause he cares about the school's reputation, and the district's reputation, and HIS OWN reputation. god this pisses me off because none of this would have happened if it wasn't for that stupid guy from the patriot news. jake and i would still be allowed to be alone. jake and i would still be trusted together. and jake wouldn't be in trouble. AHHHHHHH. one of the worst things is that jake might not be able to go to the mayfair tomorrow. i really want him to go cause i HAVE to tell him something. i want to be with him...without parents. cause in case you haven't caught on 0 trust alone=no handjobs and/or fingering. AHHH i don't wanna live with that!!! this whole thing is being totally blown out of proportion for absolutely no reason. he's just a kid, with a website, that he writes, things on. he doesn't do drugs, he doesn't have sex, he's a good kid that let's his emotions out in a blog. IS THAT SO FUCKING WRONG?!?!?! i mean way to take away FREEDOM OF SPEECH. way to put unnecessary boundaries on someone's life. who knows? maybe if he didn't have his blog to let things out in to he might keep it inside until he exploded (or imploded...your choice). he could be doing things that are worse than fingering his girlfriend. this week was so awesome awaiting to fair and the dinner dance and possibly the after party. who knows if jake is even gonna be allowed to go to the after party now. his parents might think "oh no jake and megan and friends at a house while it's dark OMG ORGY!!! we can't let our innocent little son pertake in that kind of thing" well guess what. even if jake wanted to have sex or something. i wouldn't. i mean even though our parents can't trust us together. can't they realize that up until now we've been good kids? can't they see that we haven't changed? i still have morals and beliefs. if they can't then that's THEIR problem for not knowing their own kids and it's not something that WE should be punished for. we don't meddle in their affairs so why should they care so much about a stupid blog? why should they care so much about our lives? oh sure they want the best for us and they want us to grow up to be nice people and live nice traditional lives. well writing in a blog that is only read m=by a couple people is not going to change how i end up. it's not going to change who i am and it's not going to effect any future jobs that i will have. my employer won't say "well on your record here it says that once in your life you participated in writing in a blog. i'm sorry but we cannot hire you because of your past experience". i mean really, come on people. AHHHHH!!!! i just want to scream and AHHH. but i guess i should do my homework so on that note..i'm out

      okay well i feel terrible about a conversation i had with jake earlier. i'm driving him away, i can tell. nobody would want to be with an insufferable bitch like myself. i treat him like shit, pretend i don't care, and don't appreciate all he's done for my life. for those shallow enough to believe that him doing stuff for my life means stuff we've done together, fuck you. it's more than that. it's more than i can ever describe in words. more than i've ever felt before. yeah some may think that we throw the world love around too much because yeah it is just a word. for me though, jake gives it a meaning. a meaning that once again i am at a loss for words to begin to describe. my love for him is indescribable. and what do i do? i say mean things to him and the first time he says something mildly offensive to me i flip out on him. it's not fair. he says he's gotten used to it from me. but is that really something i want him to get used to about me? something i want him to expect of me? hell no. i want him to know that i love him, truly love him, and that no matter what happens, no matter how far he lives away, the way i feel is not gonna change. i can't help the way i am, nor do i want to change the way i am. i just wish i wasn't so creul to someone i care for so much. lucky me, first guy i ever have these feelings for is moving in less than 2 months. less than 2 fucking months. what happens then? i know there's life after jake but i don't even want to imagine having to say goodbye and know that he's not coming back for a while and he won't always be there for me. even my mom is already crying just thinking about having to watch me go through with him leaving and she has no idea how i feel. nobody really knows how i feel. maybe kristin to a certain extent. yeah well fuck this, no one reads it anyway and i said what i needed to.

      today SUCKED to the max. school was boring...as usual. i IMed mandi...big mistake. she started bitching at me again. somehow she got to kristin and when i talked to kristin she was even sticking up for mandi. wtf? what happened to the kristin that i used to have fun talking about mandi with? so then julie w confronted mandi about things she said. she was blocked. before julie had told me that she sat with mandi because no one else did. to mandi she said that she ENJOYED sitting with her and that they WERE good friends. wtf? it's an epidemic. why is everyone afraid of having mandi hate them? i surely don't care what mandi, or anyone else for that matter, thinks of me. so what if i get in fights because of being upfront and my sometimes brutal honesty. i don't care, these people aren't impacting my life enough for me to compromise who i am. i am what i am and NO ONE is gonna make me change that. so now i was pissed, mandi was being a bitch and kristin and julie had totally betrayed me. i wanted to be with jake so much. i had another urge to go to hampden park. i wanted to go to the park with jake cause i needed to calm down before i lashed out at someone. however my mom didn't want me to go so she was the victim of my rage. so here i am now, still pissed, in need of a hug, and just totally down. well i think i'm done...love ya jake...

      went to the pool...for a half hour. wasn't worth it. we were gonna go see spiderman 2 but jake's mom "doesn't feel like driving". yeah she hates me. oh well. if she doesn't want me to hang out with jake (maybe cause i'm SUCH A bad influence) maye i shouldn't. parents do what they think is best and in this case his mom is protecting him. i don't wanna mess that up. do i?

       today started off cool. i woke up strangly hyper and around 10 jake called and then we went to the pool. it was fun. the water was coldish. got home, my computer worked. jake got on with some bad news. his mom read this and didn't exactly like that i "slapped the shit" out of jake. from reading that it sounds like i was beating him up. but i wasn't i just like slapped him softly a couple times and he was like cowering in fear. not actually scared but just like joking. whatever she told jake's dad. and basically if they weren't moving soon they would force us to break up. right. overreact much? so i'm sad and worried and pissed and feeling misunderstood. whatever before they disliked me for no reason so i guess they have a reason now. great for them. his mom said something about them moving in 9 days which confuses me cause i was under the impression that it was august 9, 14 days from now. which would mean next wednesday.&nbsp; especially since i'm leaving this week for 5 days and i won't be home until sunday. which would mean possibly tomorrow, next monday, and tuesday to see him.&nbsp;omg. i gotta go cause i really am not in the mood for writing right now. later, love ya jake.

      okay well these past 2 days have been awesome. monday was the pool with jake and that rocked, then julie's with sarah, jake, gg, jess, and gaby. mud wrestling turned into mud throwing. creek wading turned into creek swimming. it was awesome. we ran around screaming in the neighborhood at about 2. it was cool, but a guy smoking scared the shit out of us. we mooned a couple cars hahaha. and yeah it was rad. went to the pool again with jake today. full of annoyances. these guys knew my name...i was scared. i almost missed my bus home cause of my shitty busdriver leaving the second the whistle blew. then she bitched at me but yeah yeah whatever. now i'm home eating pizza. and even though it is not 1:37 PM i am setting my clock to say so. military time baby

       despite the   fact that i haven't talked to jake since wednesday, i still feel alive. i have something i want to tell him even if he thinks i'm crazy. cause right now i am feeling pretty crazy. i like it though. it's like, no matter what happens, i'm gonna stay me&nbsp; and do what i need to do to make my life the best. i took this picture last night so you guys can have fun with that...nvm i don't think it's working.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       i know he dislikes me. but i still care about him and want to be friends with him. when he IMs i think "wow maybe he wants to talk" but he's usually criticizing something or commenting on it, and then the convo is done. end. and i'm left like okay, why?

       okay well absolutely bored and nothing to do, no one to talk to. i talked to  him  again. kind of. i dunno if i will again though cause he makes me hate myself. which i don't like. i saw haunted mansion tonight, it was scary. today while i was sweeping the porch i had a revelation type thing. i realized that i want to get through high school and college. meet up with the man of my dreams (can anyone guess who that is?), marry him, get our careers going, buy a house, and then i want to have a kid. okay now this is big for me cause before i did not want to have kids. but i was thinking. i want to have a daughter and show her things and ways of the world. i even came up with a name. melizabeth. mel for short. yeah stupid i know, but i like it. it's originalish. okay so how does all this thinking become a revelation you may ask? i realize that i have a future and i want to live to see it. no more "accidently taking too many pills" or "dropping sharp objects on myself". i'm gonna live my life to it's full extent and when the future comes, i'll be ready. and i hope he's there to see me through it and cheer me on. and when i say he, i mean jake, the guy i love.

      the title might not make sense to those who are not living my life, which is all of you reading this. therefore i will explain it. this morning i woke up still happy from such an awesome day yesterday. i was still floating when i was told that i had to fold 4 loads of laundry. then i ate breakfast. then i got on the computer to work on my social studies. so now my floating cloud was getting closer to land again. how dull? so while i'm working my dad comes down and tells me that i have to clean up the back porch...again. so now i'm back to mehness after only being awake 3 hours. to add to the mehness, jake is in virginia...registering for school. he's really moving isn't he? sometimes it doesn't seem real. like for some reason it's been a huge practical joke and he's not really going to leave at all. some joke. speaking of jokes. knock knock. who's there? megan has a life. HAHAHAHAHA! now that is a good one.

      jake came over today and it was cool cause i missed him. we had fun but my brother was SOO annoying, i thought i was going to have to kill him. i was so close to. we watched the movie paycheck which was pretty cool but i didn't really want to watch a movie because i just wanted to hang out with jake and talk to him since i won't see him for a while. oh well. the movie was good. yay finally an entry where i am happy. genuinely happy. i have julie to thank for some of that because she is such an awesome friend. and jake to thank for some other part because i love him and i love seeing him. and the other part..i dunno i just feel happy living in the moment. i don't have plans for the rest of the week and i'm okay with that. i have nothing to look forward to but that's okay because i'm living in the present, not counting down the days until i do something fun. i like being this way, it suits me well.

      this blog is turning into exactly what i don't want. a sob story of how  terrible  my life is. i have a fairly decent life but at the moment i seem to be blinded by what's going to happen in the near future. i'm letting that thought rule my life and control my emotions. it makes for very lame blog writing/reading. i'm not gonna let myself be sad. the time to be sad will come when it comes. it's ironic though that as i make these statements for a possibly better life, i'm writing with tears in my eyes and sadness overwhelming my mind. i really don't know how i wanna live.

      okay last night was meh. day after tomorrow was funnyish. except for the wolves. i hated the wolves. annoying julie and jake was the best part of going to the movie. i had just drank a livewire so i wasn't in the mood to just sit there and watch. that kind of stuff is waaay overrated. sitting and watching movies quietly...PSHHH. okay then went home. i started to pack for a whole week at my dads and i realized how much i didn't want to go. cause i mean okay, get ready for some crazy math. 29 days-7 days (week with dad)-4 (impact)-4 (weekends with dad)=14 possible days of seeing jake before he moves. POSSIBLE  days. yeah so i cried for 2 hours. bleh. then i put in my valentine mix, put on my less than JAKE shirt, and slept down in my brother's room on the top bunk cause i have memories of jake there. innocent memories.

      well i decided not to have any fancy shit in my template cause i want it to be a reflection of me and my life. and therefore it is plain and ordinary. going to the movies tonight. day after tomorrow. should be cool. jake did awesome in his event at states. love ya jake! um yeah. a lot of people hate me. i act like i don't care, but it does hurt in a way. whatever, i'm not gonna mope around because a couple of people who don't know me, hate me.

       yeah well..went to championship tonight. it was okay, the only band i really liked was mayfield. i find bombing adam to be overrated. whatever. i bought mayfield's CD. julie and i went to salvation army this morning. it was crowded.  i haven't talked to jake in 2 days, but he emailed me kind of. and he updated his blog. which made me miss him. which made me cry. yeah. ugh i've been eating a lot since jake left. nothing healthy either. fuck...i miss him so much. i just want him to hold me. fucking navy.

       jake's gone. virginia is now his new home. and if he ever refers to his friends here when he's talking to the new friends that he will make, we'll be his 'friend back in pennsylvania' or for me, 'his girlfriend back in pennsylvania'. it's just really weird knowing that i can't just call him up and ask him if he wants to do something. visits will be few and much time in between opposed to almost every day. it's weird. so many things remind me of him. 3's, bowling, vh1, julie's bathroom, corners, everything. i think that everything i look at i can somehow remember him. even looking at myself in the mirror reminds me of him because he's become a part of me, a very important part at that. bleh i feel emo.

       yeah. i said goodbye to jake today. one of the hardest things i've had to do. i cried for about an hour until i realized how pathetic i was being and that these are the 'great years of my life' and i shouldn't waste them. there's a future for jake and i and when it comes i'll be ready. but until then i'm going to live my life as fully as i can. i need a change in my life and it's starting with my room. i currently hate how my room is and my mom and i went shopping tonight looking for new furniture and stuff. we found the perfect set. and it's in my mom's price range too. i love jake and i miss him already but i can't just wait for him to come back. i have to live.

         i think jake's parents are trying to kill me. tuesday, nothing. wednesday, the pool but then no bowling to say goodbye to friends. what reason did they have? "we're busy" "you already spent enough time with  her  today". i offered to give him a ride and it wasn't just about him seeing me. today, no pool cause he had to paint the fence which he finished around 11:30. they better let him go bowling tomorrow and then to my house cause i'll be mad if i don't get to say goodbye to him and if everyone else doesn't get to as well.  i gave jake a CD and i'm hoping to give him something else. he gave me a CD as well and i love it. it was the first time i had listened to tracy chapman songs since i was little. i can't believe it's here. these last few weeks have flown by so fast that i don't even remember things i did. no more pool. maybe i'll never go there again. we have so many memories there and it's just hard to picture myself going there without him. even though it's completely public it just feels like "our place". along with the bowling alley and kb toys. and every other place i've been with him. they're all special and have something that reminds me of how unique my relationship with jake is. i love him so much. it's weird to think that the next time i talk to him online will be when he's in virginia. i hate that i don't know for sure which day he's leaving. it could be tomorrow, the next day, or the next day. that uncertainty is killing me because i wanna know how long we have left and how many more times i'll be able to see him.   i can't accept that. but it seems that i have to.

       impact was great. it was exactly what i needed. last night julie, jake, tom, matt, chad, and i went to see the village. it was interesting and confusing at the same time. julie made out with tom lolz. and now they are going out. tonight we partied at kristin's house.  it was cool. julie w was there..ugh. i hate it when people bring up jake moving. they don't get how hard i have to try not to think about it. so then jake and i went for a walk to talk about it. if they throw a "party" i'm not going. i just won't. i can't. i got my schedule in the mail. ugh. i don't wanna go back to school. i don't have lunch with anyone i know. except katy babbs..i have so much left to do with my social studies project and since jake's mom is probably gonna have him clean his room for the rest of the week, maybe i'll have time to do it. maybe.
