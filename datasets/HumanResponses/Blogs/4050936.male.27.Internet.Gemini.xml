       This is really just an observation, but I feel a bit vindicated now that my building owner too has made the same observation.      When I first moved into this apartment a little less than 2 years ago, I found a vacant building behind mine. It was pretty large and mostly made of concrete.     After a couple of months, demolition began. Other than the dust, it didn't really bother me. However, as the building was about 75% removed, my door started scraping the frame. I didn't really know why, but figured the configuration of my wall changed. Then I noticed a couple of new cracks in in my walls. Then it occurred to me: As the massive weight adjacent to my building was being removed, my building was partially sinking.     My wife didn't really buy it. But I knew what was going on.      Months later (now), the little doors to the mailboxes in my building started popping off. Seemed pretty bizarre, but finally the cause was revealed in a note from the building to residents.     "Due to the building shifting, the doors are coming off the mailboxes".      So there it is folks, I was right.  My stupid apartment is sinking. Hopefully when they put the new building up, all will be right.

       Well...it's been about 50 years and now I'm finally heading back to school. I have one weekend left before classes start. I was registered for Biology and Chemistry, but I think that's too much. I need to ease myself back in. So I swapped chemistry for speech...I mean why not. Plus it wont cut into my job, which I'm actually starting to enjoy, despite all those losers on fucked company. I can't help it if they didn't "stick".  Anyhoo. What will I do on my last weekend? I dunno. We have a pretty big deal going down at work and while all the crazy work is supposed to culminate into the big prize this Friday, I wouldn't be surprised if something came up and I ended up working.  Maybe I can just go relax with Turkman if he's not too busy with his fancy motorbike.

       I have to admit, this TV show freaks me out. Of course they have a right to broadcast their message, but I wonder how many people buy into this stuff. Believe it or not, I'll actually gawk at it for a few minutes as I'm cruising around TV land. But those of you who know me, know how I feel about religion. And those of you who know me well, know how I feel about western religion.  So tonight I'm just finishing up my daily  urlLink Mr. Plow  and find myself at the start of the 700 club. So I watch as I play  urlLink Snake 3D .  Let me just get this straight. During this time of terror, shouldn't the US be seeking help and cooperation from our allies in eliminating the possibility of future al Qaeda attacks?  "They [al Qaeda] are desperate, desperate, to block the election of George Bush this fall.", reports Pat Robertson. "They hate Bush", he continues, "because Bush has gone after them".  "They want a president of the United States that will go to the United Nations and ask permission to do something and ask the [can't understand but I think it's "French"] if it's ok with them and I'm not sure if that's what the American people want but al Qaeda certainly wants it."  So Democrats are typically in favor of the United Nations. They see the value in having the countries of the world work together to ensure peace and security. The UN grew out of the need for countries to work together to ensure the world didn't fall into evil hands. This really illustrates how good old Pat feels about the UN!  At one point, al Qaeda was a US problem. We had to deal with it alone. However, when they killed commuters in Spain, we had an opportunity to get support from Spain in the war on terror. It's opportunities like these we need to make use of to strengthen our ability to fight these guys.  So then the next bit of news comes up.  The American's United for the separation of Church and State filed a law suit against the Harris County Civil Courts building in Texas because they had a Bible on display out front, which had been there for about 50 years. They wanted the Bible removed and won the law suit when a judge ruled it violated the separation of church and state.  What did Pat have to say about the people who wanted it removed?  "They are bunch of left-wing former communists who are making all these charges, starting with the ACLU, which was founded by a man who, uh, himself was a communist..."  You know, I kind of like the idea of the American Civil Liberties Union. If you check them out, they say they aim to protect your right to free speech, your right to equal protection under the law, your right to due process, your right to privacy, and even freedom of religion. You know, it's nice to have this organization that started in the '20s and is 400,000 strong who's goal is to ensure our basic freedoms.  Apparently, Pat Robertson doesn't think we need this group protecting our rights. Let's continue!  "...and they wanted to destroy religion in America and the terrible thing about it is they got compliant judges who are going along with them and are undermining our entire religious heritage in America and if we don't do something about it and change those courts and those judges this countries going right down the tubes and it's time we do something. And to talk about a wonderful day of diversity."  That last line is in response from someone in the AU saying it was a wonderful day of diversity after hearing they won the law suit. And, I don't know who she is, but the lesser (female) co-host of the 700 club had this to say after Robertson.  "Well wouldn't diversity mean that the Bible gets to stay there?"  Ok, what a dumb bitch. If you watch this person on the show, it becomes immediately clear that she's a complete dumbass. And I mean complete.  The whole idea is that if you put the Bible there, you are saying, "Christianity is the official religion of the United States" and we want everyone to feel they can practice whatever religion they want. The real issue is that they don't want the US to recognize other religions and they can't say that without looking like assholes. So, this is the second best way to say that.  While I believe the 700 Club has the right to have their show, I feel it is an evil one. It's not truthful and promotes selfishness in the name of Christianity.

       Dang!  That threw me for a loop. If you'll recall, previously I was bitching about the stupid damn login problems I was having. Well, I finally found the problem. I was using blogger.com and blogspot.com interchangably!  Can you believe it? I don't know how I got into that mess, but man, am I glad to have figured it out!  Your blog is on blogger.com Your blog is on blogger.com Your blog is on blogger.com

       I'm a pretty big Simpson's fan and watch the show pretty often. I usually have about 5 episodes stored on my DVR that I pick from daily.  If you think about it, most cartoons will "reset" each episode. Someone dies, they come back the next time, much like Itchy and Scratchy. However, the Simpson's have events that don't reset. And there are some items that are even carried through and recognized in other episodes. You never hear Fred Flintstone talking about how his car broke down in a previous episode.  Below are some sticking events that I can come up with.  Flander's wife Maud stayed dead. Milhouse's parent's stayed seperated. Homer remembers every job he's ever had. Homer refuses to admit he ever had a snow plowing job, which he did. Marge retained the elephant and some of the props used for Apu's wedding.  Anyhoo, there are only about a million examples...these are just what I can come up with on my way out the door for some dinner.  Let's just hope it's true, "Never fear, we've got stories for years".

       Life is so fascinating. Without it, this planet would be only as complex as the geological and atmospheric systems that define it, limited by the laws of physics. When you add life to the picture, you give a whole new endless array of possibilities. Life gives the planet, solar system, galaxy and universe the ability to appreciate its own complexity and capability.    Humans have developed solar panels - essentially a tool that converts sunlight into usable energy. Yet we've only mimicked the leaf. We've built our submarines that employ buoyancy systems that already exist in fish. Looking to nature, humans have a lot to gain by the study of these systems.  It's this fascination that is driving me to the study of life, biology. This will give me the ability to understand specifically the swimming animals that inhabit the wet half of the planet. Fish!  I hope I can use my background in technology to create tools for use in the field of ichthyology. Maybe not. But this is my new path, at the old age of 27. I hope it's only not too late!

       I started writing GW Basic code on my friends 80286 around 1993, maybe a little earlier. I had found something I could do, learn and be proud of. Mostly I was writing text based role playing games.  After that, I found the thrill of writing graphics code. Yes, it was then Q-Basic when I started, but seeing my code generate a 3D perspective out of numbers was awesome. Later I moved that code over to C. With an evaluation copy of Borland's Turbo C++, I was in heaven. I was even trapping key events and doing things such as rotating wire-frame cubes. In high-school, for my Chemistry final project, I wrote an application that helped tutor the rest of the students for the final exam - it was complete with questions, formulas and even graphics of chemistry lab equipment.  I found a job as an intern for a financial consulting startup. There I received my first real lesson with working in Microsoft. At that time, I didn't realize the challenge of programming was not only my lack of knowledge of OO, but also due to Microsoft's Visual Basic. I thought Visual Basic was how things where done. It was pretty discouraging, but my decision to take on C++ at home illustrated how Microsoft really tries to splinter MS developers off from the rest of the world.  A few years later, I moved on to writing web applications on GNU/Linux with PHP and Apache. This was great. A little adjustment to how I viewed application development and I was off running.  GNU/Linux was great. It was a breath of fresh air. It made me reconsider what I expected from my computer. Because of GNU/Linux and the level of quality from some open source packages, I have a new, higher level of expectation from software vendors.  Being a GNU/Linux user, you run into the Microsoft crowd (read everyone else). You can see their intolerance. You can see how afraid they are when you speak of not using Microsoft. Microsoft is security. Microsoft is how people sleep at night. Sure, they know they don't have complete control over the software they use and develop with, but they will gladly trade that for the feeling of safety.  They too are prepared to combat anything else. Microsoft has given them an arsenal of ways of thinking about GNU/Linux and other open source software.  "It's built by hippies in a basement somewhere" "There is no real support for it" "If we use it, we'll have to give our valuable software away for free" "The quality is very poor" "Open Source followers are just religious fanatics"  It's kind of like when you try to have a political conversation with someone who aligns themselves with a particular party. They are full of those one liners. They never really thought it out. They blindly follow what they consider to be right. There is no point in having that conversation.  Now we are looking at software patents. Someone gets to patent some software, any software (the patent office makes this possible), and then they threaten to sue people. They threaten small companies and individuals who don't have the money to go to court. So they settle.  This is why I'm getting out of technology. It was fun, promising and I was sure I had found my path for life. But selfish people are taking that away.  Then, where am I going? Well, I'll write about that soon.

       Just a little rant.  First of all, I'm a software developer. I primarily work on web applications....web applications that require a username and password. I also have to support such software. I can't even tell you how many times I enter a username and password on a daily basis...it must be around a billion...I'm VERY GOOD at entering a username and password.  having said that, I can't tell you how annoying it is to come to blogspot.com, enter my username and password, only to have it fail. It will tell me my password is wrong about 2 or 3 times before I convince it my password is correct.  Why? Why wont it accept it the first time. Why does it take me supplying it 2 or 3 times, exactly the same password, before it finally caves?  Finally, after using a pretty lame "Forgot password" model that doesn't work, I open a support ticket and no one gets back to me.  I guess it's free right? Nonetheless, if you offer a service, you should try to do it well.
