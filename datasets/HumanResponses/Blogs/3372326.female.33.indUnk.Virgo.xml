      I drink quite a bit of coffee and have recently switched partly to decaf, so this May 2004 article from the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter was of particular interest to me:  urlLink Is It True What They Say About Decaf?   Here's an article about caffeine from CSPI's Nutrition Action Health Letter (one of my favourite publications):  urlLink Caffeine: The Inside Scoop .

      This is from  urlLink SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life , a book by Steven G. Pratt. I think if you ate all of the suggested quantities, there wouldn't be room for much else, but I guess you'd be pretty darn healthy with that diet!     Beans  They lower cholesterol, fight heart disease, stabilize blood sugar, reduce obesity, lessen cancer risk, and relieve hypertension. (Eat four 1/2-cup servings a week. Don't like beans? Substitute green beans, sugar snap peas, green peas, or chick peas instead.)   Blueberries  They lower the risk of heart disease and cancer and help maintain youthful, healthy skin. (Eat 1 to 2 cups a day. When they aren't in season, eat cranberries, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, currants, and purple grapes.)   Broccoli  It boosts your immune system, reduces the incidence of cataracts, builds bones, and fights birth defects and heart disease. (Eat 1/2 to 1 cup a day. Can't stand broccoli? Eat brussels sprouts, red and green cabbage, cauliflower, bok choy, and kale.)   Oats  Oats lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes, and are high in fiber and protein. (Eat five to seven servings a week. Don't want it that often? Try wheat germ, brown rice, barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, millet, and quinoa.)   Oranges  They support heart health while preventing cancer, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic ailments. (Eat one a day. Want more variety? Try lemons, grapefruit, kumquats, tangerines, or limes.)   Pumpkin  It's not just for pie. Pumpkin lowers the risk of various cancers, while it promotes youthful, healthy skin. (Eat 1/2 cup a day. Want an alternative? Try carrots, carrots, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, and orange bell peppers.)   Soy  It prevents heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis, as well as relieves menopausal and menstrual symptoms. (Eat at least 15 grams daily. Don't like soy? Try tofu, soymilk, soy nuts, edamame, or miso.)   Spinach  Popeye was on to something! Spinach lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases, a variety of cancers, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts. (Eat 1 cup of steamed spinach or 2 cups of raw spinach a day. Don't like it? Then eat kale, collards, Swiss chard, bok choy, romaine lettuce, mustard, or turnip greens.)   Tea (Black or green)  Besides soothing the soul, tea boosts the immune system, helps prevent cancer and osteoporosis, lowers stroke risk, and promotes cardiovascular health. (Drink at least one cup a day.)   Tomatoes  They lower cancer risk, increase your skin's sun-protection factor, and play a role in preventing cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. (Eat one tomato a day. Don't like them? Try watermelon, persimmons, or pink grapefruit instead.)   Turkey (skinless breast)  It's not just for Thanksgiving. Turkey is not only the perfect healthy low-fat protein, but also builds a strong immune system. (Eat three or four 3-ounce servings a week. Want something else? Skinless chicken breast is a great alternative.)   Walnuts  How nutty is this? Walnuts reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. (Eat 1 ounce five times a week. Other options include almonds, pistachios, sesame seeds, peanuts, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, macadamia nuts, pecans, hazelnuts, and cashews.)   Wild salmon  It lowers risk of heart disease and cancer. (Eat it two to four times a week. Don't like salmon? Go for Alaskan halibut, canned albacore tuna, sardines, herring, trout, sea bass, or clams.)   Yogurt  In addition to being a great source of protein and calcium, yogurt promotes strong bones and a healthy heart. (Eat 2 cups a day. Want something else? Try kefir.)

I bought them at Safeway and I think they were labeled California 4044 Tree Ripe (I'm not completely sure because the stickers are long gone). Now, this is very important because today I had part of a peach that, while deceivingly similar to the heavenly ones, was absolutely terrible--grainy and lacking in flavour. This peach was labeled California 4038--not "Tree Ripe"! I think that's the difference, but I will try to confirm this!

      This has to be one of the silliest new developments in food production. See  urlLink CNN.com - Potato growers eye low-carb spuds - Jun 22, 2004 . Talk about jumping on the low-carb bandwagon.  These people should put as much time and money into something more useful such as finding a cure for cancer. I'm sure the world could live without low-carb potatoes!  For those trying to lose weight on low-carb diets, this is NOT the answer. The article states:  Colette Heimowitz of the Atkins Health & Medical Information Services, said potatoes are not recommended until a dieter reaches a goal weight.  "Once they achieve their weight loss, it is fine," she said, noting  the same carbohydrate reduction offered by the new potato could be accomplished by eating a third less of a regular potato .

      Blogging everything I eat and drink seems like an odd thing to do, doesn't it? Well, it isn't for ME. Why? Food is a pretty important part of my life. I  love  food, and I'm very interested in nutrition--though I certainly don't make the best choices all of the time. (One of the problems with being well-informed about food is always knowing I could do better, and never being able to eat something bad for me without knowing just how bad it is and why.)   Blogging what I eat and drink takes about five to ten minutes a day; sometimes a little longer. I think the benefits outweigh the time commitment though. First, and most important, it engenders complete awareness of everything I consume. There are actually times when I want to eat something (let's say in the 'poor-choice' category), but I don't eat it because I don't want to blog it. It's embarassing to me, even if I'm the only one reading my food log!   Another advantage is that I can tell quickly if I'm getting 5-10 servings of fruits and veggies a day, and other 'should-haves'. A bonus benefit is knowing exactly when something was prepared. This really comes in handy when looking in the fridge and wondering "is that still okay to eat? when did we make that?" We try new recipes frequently in my house, and it's nice to have a record of what we made and where the recipe is. My food log is also a place I can record my own creations, plus recipes and links I want to remember or share.

I'm quite choosy about yogurts, especially flavoured ones. I don't care for the non-fat yogurts, yet I try to stay away from the higher fat ones, and most brands put way too much fruit/sugar in the cup--you can't even taste the yogurt! The new Yoplait "Delicieux" 2.5% I tried yesterday was not bad, and this new Yoplait "Creme & fruit" 1.9% is okay as well. I hadn't purchased any flavoured yogurt for several weeks now, but I had been buying Danone "Creamy" (2% I think) almost exclusively; I generally regret it when I buy any other kind.

      Just completed my Wellness Checkpoint at work. It says I should consider the following changes:    Try to eat at least 5 fruits and/or vegetables EVERY day.   Cut down on snacks with 'empty' calories from fats and sugars but with little nutrient value.   Try to eat cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts or cauliflower three or more TIMES A WEEK.   Eat beans and lentils at least once a week. They are high in fiber and protein and low in fat.   Cut down on processed, smoked or cured meats (no more than once a week).   Cut down on saturated fats in hard cheese, butter, sour cream and cream cheese. Watch the fat content in your margarine.   Drink 8 glasses of water each day.   Try to eat fish regularly. Salmon and tuna are good choices for sandwiches.    Yes, I know; I'll try.

      We had the most excellent meal for supper this evening! Darren, Laurel, and Bronwyn joined us.  It's interesting how things work out... I received an email from FoodTV Canada (foodtv.ca) this week that suggested registering for the "World’s Longest Barbeque" at this  urlLink Flavours of Canada website  for a chance to win a prize. The barbeque, in support of Canadian food producers, was scheduled for 6 p.m. Saturday July 31, 2004. So, since I'm a contest-entering web-surfing kind of gal, I clicked on the link, and then another, and then learned that my mom had registered! (I don't even know how she heard about it; perhaps through the Bison Association?)  And so we registered too, and we hope to win a prize of course (especially the Weber Genesis grill!), but the funny thing is, we would have had a barbeque on this very day, at the right time, and with all of this great food from local producers anyway!  Here's what we ate for supper today:    Whole wheat focaccia bread (purchased at the Farmers Market today), sliced thickly, toasted on the grill, and served with Fresh Tomato Purée (recipe follows);  Bison ribeye steak, marinated (from frozen) all afternoon in French Steak Marinade (recipe follows);  Grilled-in-the-Husk Corn with Lime & Chili Butter (recipes follow);  New potatoes and carrots, diced, tossed with olive oil and spices (Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning, a blend of freeze-dried herbs, fresh ground pepper, and sea salt), and cooked in foil on the BBQ; and (:::drum roll, please:::)  Saskatoon Berry Crisp (recipe follows) with vanilla ice cream.        Fresh Tomato Purée     about 1-1/2 lbs. of fresh ripe tomatoes  3 cloves of garlic, chopped  1 tsp. salt  1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper (chili flakes)   Core tomatoes and cut a large X on the top and bottom of each one. Pour boiling water over tomatoes to cover. Let stand for one minute. Drain. Remove skin from tomatoes, then cut into halves and remove seeds using a spoon.  Place prepared tomatoes, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes into a food processor and pulse for a few seconds until no chunks remain. At this point, you may wish to strain some liquid out.  Serve with slices of any dense rustic bread such as Ciabatta. You may leave the bread slices as is, or toast them on the grill before serving. Spoon purée onto bread just before eating.   French Steak Marinade  (for four steaks)    red wine, about 1 cup  Dijon mustard, about 2 Tbsp.  minced garlic, about 2 or 3 cloves (1 heaping teaspoon)  rosemary or thyme leaves, crushed between fingers, about 1 or 2 tsp.    Grilled-in-the-Husk Corn   Cobs of corn with husks in tact (do not remove any husk or silk before cooking)  In a preheated barbeque, place cobs on a second-tier grill rack so they are not too close to the flame. Use tongs to turn cobs often. Cook for about 30 minutes.   Remove the husks and silk from cobs before serving. Be careful—they’re extremely hot! (Heat-resistant gloves would be useful.)   Lime & Chili Butter     1/2 cup butter, softened  1 tsp. grated lime rind  2 tbsp. lime juice  1 tsp. chili powder   Stir all together until smooth. Spoon onto plastic wrap; shape into log and wrap tightly. Refrigerate until firm. Slice into 1/2-inch thick rounds to serve. (Refrigerate for up to two weeks.)   Saskatoon Berry Crisp     4 cups Saskatoon berries  1/2 cup flour  1 cup rolled oats  3/4 cup brown sugar  1 tsp. cinnamon  1/2 tsp. salt  1/2 cup butter   Put the berries in a baking dish. Blend remaining ingredients (a food processor works well) and distribute evenly on top of the berries. Bake at 400° for 25-35 minutes.

      I made up this recipe myself and it's really delicious!  Good crusty bread, such as sourdough or French bread, sliced about 3/4" thick Feta cheese in brine, drained Greek dressing Ripe tomatoes, sliced  Mash the drained Feta with a fork and mix in a bit of Greek dressing. Toast the bread slices on a grill (or use a toaster or oven). Spread the cheese mixture onto the toast. Top with tomato slices. Devour.

      I made Saskatoon Berry Crisp again last evening using berries that Neil picked at the farm. (We had Todd, Karla, Aly, and Zach over for supper, so it was nice to make something special--and very easy--for dessert. Derek W and Ali C also popped in after their ultimate flying disc game and enjoyed some dessert too.)  I modified the recipe a little (doubled the berries and omitted the white sugar), so here it is again in its revised form:   Saskatoon Berry Crisp     4 cups Saskatoon berries  1/2 cup flour  1 cup rolled oats  3/4 cup brown sugar  1 tsp. cinnamon  1/2 tsp. salt  1/2 cup butter   Put the berries in a baking dish. Blend remaining ingredients (a food processor works well) and distribute evenly on top of the berries. Bake at 400° for 25-35 minutes.

      I went to the  Selam Ethiopian Restaurant  (2115 Broad Street, Regina, Saskatchewan) for lunch on Wednesday with a group of coworkers. It was wonderful! Great atmosphere and food!  I had a beef Sambosa (a crunchy triangular pocket stuffed with a spicy beef mixture) with a fresh salsa-type dip to start, which was fantastic; I could eat an entire meal of Sambosas. Then I had a vegetable Wot (a stew of potatoes, green beans, carrots, and onions), collard greens, and a mild lentil Wot, with Ingera (large steamed pancakes made from Tef). We were also served Ethiopian coffee and buttered popcorn after our main course!  I can't wait to go back!

      Three of my coworkers and I went to the 13th Avenue Coffee House for a break Friday afternoon--a very rare event (or perhaps just for rare for me as I rarely work on Fridays!). Anywho, Stacy must have skipped lunch because she ordered a rice bowl in the middle of the afternoon. I want to remember to try this at home:    warm brown rice,  slivered raw carrot,  diced cucumber,  bean sprouts, and  peanut sauce (perhaps a peanut satay).
