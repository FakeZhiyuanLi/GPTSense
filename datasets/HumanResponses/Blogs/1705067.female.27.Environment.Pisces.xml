       Writers are not just people who sit down and write. They hazard themselves. Every time you compose a book your composition of yourself is at stake. ~E.L. Doctorow   Dear Fellow Bloggers,  I am sorry. Please accept my sincere apologies.  I used to be a blog snob. I used to think: Why must my friends write about their lives on the web, rather than tell me what's going on in their lives in person, or on the phone, by e-mail, or even by that almost extinct form of communication, letter writing? It all seemed so impersonal. I guess I thought that by blogging, my friends would somehow become less close to me, because they might not share their lives with me in person, on the phone, by e-mail, or by snail-mail, now that they can just say: Read my blog! What I didn't realize is that blogging isn't simply a chronology of one's life, it's a way for someone to let people into their lives, their thoughts, their feelings, in a way that sometimes isn't possible with other forms of communication, no matter how close you are to someone.   Blogging is also an outlet for creativity, and I'm all for creativity. There just isn't enough of it in this world. Sure, there's creativity all around us...music...books...art...etc...but it's not necessarily coming  from  us. Many people nowadays are so caught up with the race against time, to "catch up" when there's always more to, they push that aspect, that creative aspect, of themselves away from them. Blogging, I've seen, is a way to bring that aspect back.    Of course, blogging is many more things to many more people...but I've chosen to write about communication and creativity because those are what this blog will be to me.    Needless to say, I think I am becoming quite attached to my blog.  Yours truly, ss  PS Thx to james for bringing me back to writing.

      Grr...writer's block. So much pressure! Since this is my first blog, I feel like I should have something interesting and insightful to say. But all this work setting up my new blog has made me quite hungry. I think I need a snack before I get back to writing. Next time I'll stop by with a full stomach. That way, it'll be easier for me to figure out how this thing works...

      Been awhile...  My sister moved back into the house a little while ago. In an effort to re-integrate all the "stuff" she's brought back from her apartment, including various items her roommate left behind because she moved back out West, we've been trying to once and for all get rid of all that junk that gets shoved under the bed, in closets and desk drawers, the useless nick nacks that pile up on virtually any flat surface in a room and any other "things" that have accumulated dust over the years.    One of the things I found while doing all this cleaning and reorganizing was an old diary I kept when I was 8-9 years old. I remember that I'd gotten the diary for a gift, and thought it was quite cool...that is, until my dad saw it and decided that it was a good idea to incorporate a "daily diary entry" into my homework routine! So, instead of writing in the diary when I felt like I needed/wanted to, I had to do it as a requirement. This diminished my interest such that most of my entries were reduced to boring bits of wasted paper. However, I did manage to find a few gems. Maybe if I'm bored one day I'll post a few, spelling mistakes, unfinished sentences and poor grammar included. In the meantime, back to the shoe box it'll go, with all my other items of nostalgia. It'll be funny for me to read again sometime in the future...a bit of history that reminds me of "me" as a kid.

      How does it happen that we can associate certain sounds, smells, or places with events, or people, or other places? Today while walking up the steps at Kipling subway, the dampness and humidity reminded me of swimming lessons when I was a kid. The mustiness of the hallways at Innis College remind me of the bio building at Waterloo. Those "Holiday" candles from the Gap remind me of vegging in res in first year. And maybe I shouldn't include this, but people with B.O. remind me of a certain smelly person at Sheridan College :S boo...  Good or bad, these reminders usually hit me out of the blue.  Sometimes though, I'll know what they are, and seek them out. Sarah's songs. Starry skies. Beaches at night. Wings. Abercrombie and Fitch. Beetles (eek). Sheep emoticons (to the rescue!). The Cranberries. "Hey...wha happened?"   I'll laugh, I'll smile. I'll think of you, I'll think of us.   You're not so far away right now, but fast asleep, I'm sure ;) I think now's a good time to pop Sarah into the cd player...

      I've logged on numerous times over the past week in an attempt to record my thoughts. As you can see, I haven't been successful. I have a tendency to keep what's "in my head" in my head. Sure, I'll talk about what's going on my life, and certain things that are bugging me. But my real fears, my real stresses and worries, my real beefs - those I keep mostly to myself, possibly a select few, or most often, to one person. I know it's unfair for me to do this. It's unfair for me to not confide in friends when they trust me so much to confide in me. It's unfair for me to burden one person with all of my mind dumps. And it's unhealthy for me to keep things inside.  I suppose I just don't want to seem weak to other people. By voicing my concerns, I feel that those concerns become more real. If I keep them in my head, maybe they'll go away or I'll figure out a way to deal with them. This doesn't always happen though. Instead, I'm left feeling anxious and unsettled.   I even have a hard time letting others know my goals, my hopes and my dreams. It's not that I think people will say, "That's not possible". It's that I, myself, think that I may not make those hopes and dreams a reality, that I'll fail. It's the thought that I might not be able to fulfill the goals I've set for myself, that I'll fall flat on my face, that prevents me from telling others, and maybe even from putting my whole heart into what I really want.   This isn't even what I intended to blog about in the first place, but I guess you can't really control this sort of thing. Maybe I needed to get this out there so that I can organize my other thoughts and finally get them out there, out here.  Be ready for a possible flood.

       Top 5 procrastination techniques of the day:    #1 - Play useless games on the internet.  Catch flies with chopsticks at  urlLink http://www.wickedintellect.com/flash/games/fly.swf   Attempt #1: 3 flies Attempt #2: 8 flies Attempt #3: 25 flies!  #2 - Watch reality tv. Ok, so I didn't use this technique today, but I was very tempted. I thought about it, so some time was wasted there.  #3 - Chat on MSN with friends about reality tv shows that somehow turn us in mindless zombies when we could be doing something more meaningful with our lives.  #4 - Read. You can read anything, really. However, it helps if you've got a good book that you can escape to. A book that makes you  think  is a bonus. That way, you are at least using your procrastination time wisely (if this is at all possible). It's certainly much better than watching reality tv like a mindless zombie. It's also better than chatting about reality tv, for that matter.   #5 - Blog! Then, in attempt to edit something, erase your post "by mistake". This means you'll just have to spend some more time re-blogging.

      I've been meaning to sit down and blog, but as you can plainly see by the lack of entries, I haven't done so. So before I start getting really behind...   Excerpts from my life   October 4th, 2003 - present   ---   Burning Out:   I'm still on the learning curve at work, so it's been both rewarding and frustrating at the same time. I'm racking up some good time in lieu though - I'm looking forward to three weeks off in December to recoup and re-energize.  ---   Montreal:   Not a place I'd normally choose to go for a relaxing vacation. Images of late night partying, drinking, hectic street festivals and being on the go to the next "attraction" always pass through my head. That being said, my last trip to Montreal, just this past Thanksgiving weekend, was exactly that:  relaxing .   You're the best james! You're the reason I didn't burn out. It was way too short of a trip, but I'm looking forward to our next one, whenever or wherever that may be!  ---   Kill Bill:   Very stylish. Funny. Great fight scenes. Also THE most violent and gory movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see in my life, with the possible exception of the second installment, in theatres next year.   ---   Friends:  You know you've got a keeper when you haven't seen/talked to someone in a long time and you can pick up where you left off right away, just as if you'd talked to them yesterday. Not recommended as a normal occurence, but it happens from time to time.   Thanks to my friends for being patient and understanding during this crazy-hectic time in my life.  ---   Baking:  Make sure you have all your ingredients BEFORE you start, or at least make sure you've got a means of transportation to get to the store to buy those eggs. Otherwise, you'll just be left with a half-mixed batch of raw ingredients. Totally unedible. Sigh...   ---   Geocaching:  Seems to be the coolest new  urlLink game  around. I can't wait to get started!

      Flu update (see blog of Nov. 20): I haven't gotten sick yet...phew...  I think I'll actually go and get the flu shot this year - I've held out long enough. It's supposed to help protect me from SARS too, and really, I don't want to get sick (from the flu or SARS) and potentially pass it on to the people around me, especially my friends and family.   I would explain my past stubbornness, but it would take too long (and no, I am not afraid of needles). Just know this: getting the flu shot doesn't mean that you're 100% safe - it just protects you from the strains all the health people think will hit us this flu season. That virus mutates like crazy, so the doctors and the scientists at WHO (even though they do the best they can) can't always predict what's going to happen. Scary, no?

      My grandmother left this world on Nov. 4. It wasn't entirely unexpected, but I don't think death is something you ever get used to. I wish I'd gotten to know her better - I think the language barrier, the generation gap and the differences between the world she came from and the world us kids lived in was too much to bridge when we were young. We knew though, that she loved us, and though we didn't express it much then, we loved her too. Thanks for being there for us, grandma. We'll miss you.  ---  Shortly after the funeral, my mom told me something that I will never forget: one of the my aunts was saying to my mom that she (my mom) was the only one with the patience to listen to the elders (other relatives, friends, acquaintances who are still with us) talk for hours on end. My mom said simply, listen to them now, because when they can't talk to you anymore and you WANT them to, you won't be able to do anything about it - it'll be too late.

       For children, childhood is timeless. It's always the present. Everything is in the present tense. Of course they have memories. Of course time shifts a little for them and Christmas comes round in the end. But they don't feel it. Today is what they feel, and when they say 'When I grow up . . .' there's always an edge of disbelief -- how could they ever be other than what they are. ~British author Ian McEwan   As adults, why can't we do the same?

      Wow...it's been such a long time since I've been here that for awhile there I couldn't figure out my password!  And...I just realized that almost every time I blog, I seem to be playing catch up. I guess that's the story of a procrastinator's life.  So...to catch up:  I had my three weeks off in December, and that was great. It's all a blur to me now; about the only things I remember are the pain and frustration of my first snowboarding trip (and looking forward to my next one) and spending lots and lots of money during xmas.   The best xmas present? It was from james, of course! A nice little Canon S400 digicam that fits in the palm of my hand. I'd post some pics up right now...if I knew how. I guess that's something else I'll have to play catch up on...  Oh, and the festivities...james invited me to dinner with the family xmas eve, which gave me warm fuzzies, even though I was a bit nervous...then james and I spent the countdown to new year's separately (with our own girl/guy friends), which kind of surprised some people...if we were Ben and J. Lo we'd have been on the front page of the tabloids in no time flat! But really, no big deal...we compromised. I wouldn't want to spend my new year's away from my bf every year, but once is ok.  ---  I saw Wonder Boys yesterday, which stars Micheal Douglas, Tobey MacGuire (sp?), Katie Holmes and that guy who's always getting arrested - Robert Downey Jr. It's a funny and  insightful movie about an English prof (Douglas) who's life is changed by this awkward/socially disfunctional but brilliant student of his (MacGuire). I feel like I'm writing a movie review right now...anyway, Douglas's character can't finish the follow-up book to his debut novel, which won him many accolades. During the movie, Douglas pulls out his manuscript and starts typing page number two thousand something...we later find out that the story has no direction and that decisions aren't being made in order to provide that direction - a sort of allegory for his own life. And I guess it could represent many others' lives as well, including me, with my almost constant indecisiveness...  ---  As we emerge from one of the worst winter storms in recent memory, I am thankful that I didn't get wiped out by a snowplow or swerve into oncoming traffic. I was up in Eganville (north of Ottawa) Sunday and Monday, where it was too cold to snow...on the way down for meetings in Peterborough, the weather got steadily worse. I ended up doing a 180 into a snowbank, then I got into a van with two strangers cause they offered to get me to someplace warm and call their friend who had a tow truck. Lucky for me that a) the men were actually nice people who didn't want to abduct me; b) the car was not demolished; c)  I was not hurt. I really should prepare myself better for those types of situations...  I decided then that I wouldn't be braving the roads again until today and stayed over at the Lindsay Inn, where I ate a whole pizza and watched tv all night (including the movie mentioned above).   ---  Tidbits...  TV: I'm back on the reality show bandwagon. Current addictions - Donald Trump's The Apprentice and the third season of American Idol. I found out yesterday that the contestants on Idol have to go through a pre-screening process before they face the wrath of Simon. What I'm wondering is: how do some of these people, who very obviously cannot sing, get past the first audition?   Music: Cranberries (No Need to Argue), Madonna (The Immaculate Collection) and U2 (Achtung Baby!) - all on cassette! Why? Because I finally learned that not all rental cars have cd players.  Car: NOT the Hyundai Accent. I rate it the most unsafe car to drive. EVER.

       We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it. ~John Lennon   It's not so easy anymore - we're not in school, we've got careers, bills to pay, other friends to see, family to be with, boyfriends and numerous other responsibilities.   We recognize that we've changed, but are we readily adapting, supporting and remaining true to each other as friends? Do we really even know what's going on in each other's lives?  These are questions I hope to get answered when I go away with my friends in a few weeks. We all need a vacation, and though it's been rough trying to arrange our schedules and deciding on a place to go, we've finally settled on something that works for all of us. At the very least, we'll all be together!  For this trip, I hope that we'll all be able speak frankly to each other about what's going on in our lives, good or bad. These are my closest friends, but sometimes I feel like I don't know them very well anymore, and that they don't really know me.   Of course, we're all guilty of neglecting each other, but if I can count on one thing, I can count on my friends always being there for me if I need them, even if we're not in constant communication with each other. Even so, I miss my friends, and it's frustrating when you've got great people around you that you can't see more of. This trip will give me an opportunity to reconnect, look after and nurture the friendships that are so important to me.

I'm still at work...kinda busy...  me:  oh, I'll call ya later then...  james:  it's ok...what's up?  me:  I got a text message from telus mobility saying that I get free local calls on my bday, so I'm calling you!  james:  umm...that's great, but you DO know that today is not your birthday, right?   --silence--    me:  ok then...I'll call ya later!   --click--

      And you thought Princess Consuella Bananahammock and Crap Bag were bad:  "A German court has ruled that parents do not have the right to give their child a silly name, reports The Independent on Sunday.

       Sometimes I feel like the ocean. A wave comes, a wave goes. But underneath the ocean is always calm. ~The Dalai Lama    com·pas·sion   (km-pshn) n.   Deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled with the wish to relieve it.  ---  Sitting in the car on the way home, I'd intended on blogging about something else today. Something trivial, something that was irking me. However, after reading about the Dalai Lama's visit to Canada, my negative energy is all but forgotten. Like so many others, I've been affected by his presence in our country.   And like those many others, I'll probably go back to my selfish ways very soon, but for a short while at least, I've paused to think about who the Dalai Lama is:    He's this person who works tirelessly for peace, a person who is faithful to his religion and who has faith in humans (even the Chinese government that kidnapped the Panchen Lama and continues to oppress Tibetans), a person who inspires not only his own people, or those who follow the same religion, but people of all different backgrounds and experiences to be better people. A person who really  is  a man of his word.   There can only be one Dalai Lama, but how many people in this world are even remotely like him? I really don't know (and that's a depressing thought), but at least that gives us all a starting point to strive towards.

      My stomach is still rumbling...there is still a possibility that I'll keel over with severe abdominal pain...  Mistake #1: The last time I ate a breakfast sausage was maybe five years ago. This morning I decided to eat two. Why? Why didn't I remember that eating those things is equivalent to eating a few spoonfulls of lard with my eggs?   Mistake #2: I knew before I drank that glass of chocolate milk that the chances of my stomach revolting against it was very high. But who can resist chocolate milk? mmmm...so yummy...so dangerous...I was living on the edge - unfortunately I fell over.   Mistake #3: Late afternoon - time for me to drag my lazy butt out the door and go to the gym. The pain in my midsection had subsided. I told myself that if I got a good workout in, then maybe I could go and buy myself a shake from Booster Juice. And so I did...and what do you know? They were selling half-price shakes! My lucky day...or so I thought...I tried to convince myself that the frozen yogurt in the shake, though a dairy product, should be ok because it's got all that good bacteria in it. I was wrong.  So have I learned my lesson yet? Well...I just had a piece of chocolate cake with tea. Maybe I should just go to sleep so I won't have a chance to get my stomach in more trouble...  ---  I had a clown sighting today while driving home from the gym. He was westbound in the left-turn lane, ready to go northbound. Luckily I was in a stopped position in the southbound direction. I wasn't totally paralysed, but sat fearfully in my seat, hoping he wouldn't look at me...  And he didn't, thank goodness. He made his turn and went on his way. My light turned green, and so I sped away from that disturbing sight.

       Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.  ~Robert Frost,  The Road Not Taken    Sometimes I wonder if I chose the right path...  After completing my expensive university education, I chose to forgo the usual process of mass mailing resumes in the hopes of landing a cushy job at a pharmaceutical company or government lab with a good starting salary, health benefits, great overtime pay and possible bonuses and pension plans. I chose instead to remain in Kitchener-Waterloo with a summer job that paid less than $10/hour to work with youth my age to develop a camp focusing on social justice, non-violence and environmental awareness (of course I was most interested and had a background in the latter topic, but learning more about the first two topics were definitely eye-openers for me). Our target audiences were children from low-income families and kids who had some type of learning disability that prevented them from going to other camps, so that made me feel like a good citizen who was "giving back to her community". Anyway....yes, I'm getting to the point: This job turned out to be the best I'd ever had, and served to place me firmly in a career path that was previously not so clear - I saw that this type of work meshed well with my values and wanted to continue working in the environmental field, and if possible, making a difference in young people's lives.  And so, after the job ended, I went back to live with my parents to look for a new job. Starry-eyed and full of hope, I even thought that I might land my "dream job". Months passed, and still nothing had come up that I felt passionate about. At this point, with personal funds dipping dangerously low and my parents' constant nagging, I was almost convinced to go back to the mass resume mailing process. Instead, against strong parent-pressure, I decided to postpone real life by going back to the well-known confines of school.   January rolled around. Walking down the hall of the college that looked more like a high school, I was once more placed in a "first day at school" situation: am I going to fit in? Will I do well? And now also: is this actually going to help me with my career, or am I just piling more debt on myself for no reason? Well yes, I did fit in (though strangely enough, the one person I really considered a friend and is still one now also went to Waterloo) and I did do well (there was a lot of griping about college policies, but that's for another time). As for helping my career out...well, I'd say yes to that too. I mean, I didn't get a job right out of my program, but I was less jaded about government and industry jobs. I still wasn't ready to go applying to these places though...I just wasn't ready. I needed more time in the non-profit/charitable field before I could make a difference in these other areas.  Volunteer and raise some money for yourself - a good way to get yourself off the ground in the environmental non-profit sector, that's what I found. Within 3 months of volunteering, I wriggled myself into a paid contract, then six months later I got a full-time position. My parents still weren't too happy about the lack of supposed "security" and benefits of a more (in their eyes) traditional job, but hey, it's my life, isn't it? About a year and a half later, I applied for my current job: what I thought really WAS my dream job: I get to run programs where I work in the field, in the office, with students, liase with other non-profits, government agencies and academics. I get to educate people, monitor ecological health and help people take personal action to improve the environment in their community. People are getting to know me. I can really move up. I'm one of two full-time staff, so my input into the vision for the future of the organization gets heard and I get to help implement it too.  Sounds all so wonderful, doesn't it? It's all peaches and cream on the outside, of course, but almost a year later, I'm wondering, is this really what I want? Is this where I want to be? I'm having a tough go at it because there's just so much to deal with. I have dreams (more like nightmares) about work, I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about my "to do" list. Working with so many different people is great, except when you spend more time managing them than actually getting stuff done. And when I hear about creek clean-ups, tree plantings or environmental events, I don't get that feeling of "hey, I can go volunteer and help out"...I feel instead like I have to go and work, because inevitably it becomes a good networking opportunity for the organization, or I get asked to bring a booth or guest-speak. I'm really having difficulty drawing the line between work and leisure time.   I know - the road will diverge once again, and at that time, I'll have to decide what to do. If I really wanted to, I'm sure I could cut the path myself whenever I feel that it's the right time. I know I shouldn't wait too long though, because I might burn myself out before that. Hopefully though, I'll instead have achieved the balance I'm seeking and I will have left all that anxiety behind so that I'm just enjoying it all again and keep on my current path, or maybe I'll have achieved or set in motion an established direction for the organization enough so that I can feel comfortable choosing another path.

       Mountains, hills, they're all called "san". ~ L.M. Dong  (my dad)    Family History Lesson No. 1   The marriage of my parents was a semi-arranged affair. His real mom and dad having passed away when he was quite young, my dad travelled to Canada with his adopted mother c.1967, the last year the Leafs won the cup. After completing his high school credits and finishing up his tech diploma at George Brown College, he wanted to settle down, so my grandma checked around with all the other ladies in Chinatown to find out if they had any relatives with whom she could set dad up with.   The result was that my dad was introduced to my mom through my great-grandmother (my mom's grandmother), whom my grandma had met way back when they both lived in China. At the time, my mother was still living in Hong Kong, having raised my aunt and uncle to adulthood by herself since the age of 14 (mom's mother had passed away that year, and her dad had gone to Brazil and wasn't ever able to come back...a story for another day).   Mom and dad exchanged pictures and letters in the usual way, gauging their interest for each other. My mom was able to come to Canada in 1974. They had a pretty winter wedding, and they've been together ever since.  ---   Family History Lesson No. 2   Sitting down to dinner yesterday, us kids decided to inquire into our family history a bit more. Already knowing that dad likes to, let's just say, "elaborate" while telling his stories, we were firmly duped.   Kids:  So, dad, how far away was mom's family's village from your family's village?  Dad:  Oh, it was far, very far away. Over a mountain it was.  Kids:   We know how you and mom met, but how did grandma (dad's side) come to know great-grandmother (mom's side)?   Dad:  Your grandma used to live in the village next to your mom's family.  Kids:  Does that mean she travelled over the mountain to find grandpa?  Dad:  No.  Kids:  So how did they meet?  Dad:  Grandpa came over the mountain to see her. He travelled so very far. Then he brought her back over the mountain.  Kids:  Wow, that must've taken a long time. Did they ride on horses or mules, or have a carriage to sit in?  Dad:  Of course not! We walked everywhere in those days!  Kids:  So how many days/weeks did it take to travel over the mountain?  Dad:  Oh, about 2 and a half hours.  Kids:  Per day?  Dad:  No, in total.  Kids:  What? That's not very far at all. That's not a mountain, that's a hill!  Dad:  Mountains, hills, same thing.   Kids:  No, it's not the same at all! You made it sound like it was an epic journey for grandpa to bring his bride home!  Dad:  It's more interesting that way. Mountains, hills, same thing. It's all the same in Chinese. Mountains, hills, they're all called "san".

       Ride the Rocket - The Better Way. ~ Toronto Transit Commission   Here goes my transit tirade...it was inevitable...  I’m a big supporter of public transit. I’m very happy that I get to sit on the subway or GO train, sleeping or reading on the way to work. I mean, who wants to idle on the DVP or 401 for an hour (at least) each sleepy morning and another hour after a hard day’s work? Or watch not only cyclists, but pedestrians pass by while trying to squeeze into the adjacent lane because of construction up ahead? Or deal with those insensitive drivers who fail to signal, blame it on you, then throw their empty coffee cups out their window towards your windshield?   Not me.   However, there ARE a few things that bother me about public transit...pet peeves, really, but I’m beginning to notice that these things are bothering me more and more.   So, if you’re ever thinking of taking public transit, or if you’re already a transit-goer, take note of the following, because I might just blow up with Rocket rage one of these days!   Top 5 Transit Transgressions   1.  Not getting up for elderly, pregnant or disabled people  - What happened to common courtesy???  2.  Wearing backpacks  – Take the backpack off and hold it in front of you or set it on top of your feet – this takes up much less room and greatly reduces the risk of knocking over the kid behind you and giving him a concussion when you turn around!  3.  Leaving the newspaper on the seat or floor  – Yes, I suppose I can give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're leaving copies of the Metro around so that passengers succeeding you can read the paper too...but I’m really not that optimistic. People are just lazy. Put the papers into the recycling bins! Chinatown is dirty? Look at the subway!	  4.  Standing in front of the exit door when there is no need  – If the train/bus/streetcar isn’t crowded and you’re not getting off at the next stop, MOVE. You’re in the way of both incoming and outgoing passengers.  5.  Not wearing deodorant  – Enough said.

      I miss James, but I can't call him becuase he's in Minnesota. He's been there for the last five days, training with the IT geeks down at head office. I know, I'm generalizing. They're probably not all geeks - it's just more fun to imagine that they are. I'm sure they're nice people - actually, I know they are because they're throwing a bbq for James as I blog!  ---   urlLink Summerlicious  is here! Yay! Yummy food priced affordably at nice restaurants. What's not to like about that?   I hope I'll have the opportunity to go eat with some good company (nudge nudge, wink wink)...  ---  Now all I can think about is food...  I can't eat because it's too late. I'll just feel gross if I go to sleep right after eating - it's like I'm asking to become rounded at my waist - and I'll feel even more guilty about paying those monthly fees for my much under-used gym membership than I already do.  ---  I was at this function with James last weekend - a cocktail party in the home of one of his colleagues. Sounds very chi chi, doesn't it? Well, it was. That house was really, really super-nice, and beautifully furnished too (everything shipped up from Los Angeles!). Anyway, there were all these people there that I wouldn't have expected to be there: the Russian painter, the hairdresser, the personal fitness trainers. And we spoke to these people, the usual small-talk, because that's what people do at cocktail parties. James and I aren't fans of this "small-talk", but I can do a decent job, and on occassion I can even get right into it, if the mood strikes.   However, the mood didn't strike that night when one of the personal trainers started talking to us:   Trainer:  Do you have a gym membership?  Me:  Of course!  Trainer:  Do you use your membership?  Me:  Of course!  Trainer:  That's good, that good. Most people don't. Don't you think that's a waste of money?  Me:  Of course!   What a load of crap! Shortly after this exchange I came up with an excuse to go to the bar.   ---  Time for bed. I'm done with my random ramblings for the moment. I'm probably not making much sense anymore anyways...

      One of the poets from the reading I went to (see blog from yesterday - no, I'm not a pretentious art-fart) said that writing about difficult, sad and otherwise negative moments is more interesting than writing about happy moments. I've always approached writing with a similar mindset - I mean, I don't know if the negative moments in my life are very interesting to other people, but writing about these events allows me to vent out my frustation in what (I believe) is a less stressful and less annoying (at least to my friends, who don't have to listen to me go on and on) way to "let go" of problems/issues.  So what about the happy moments? Are they really less interesting? Well, I don't know...I guess I'm just selfish and want to keep all those memories to myself. Maybe I'm just not into sharing...  There are other reasons too, I suppose, for not shouting out to the world that I've got it good and that I'm happy and in love: I don't like making others feel like I'm boasting or competing for "happiness points" and I also find it tough to write about happy events (especially when they pertain to love) without sounding super, super cheesy.   I also think that those who are around me a lot know whether I'm happy or not, anyway. If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about my relationship here (one that has recently passed the one year mark in happiness). I know he knows I love him. I know that he loves me too. It's really just as simple as that. Why get complicated?  As he said to me, may our story be one that never ends...  ---  Cheesiness surfacing...must go...

      I went to a poetry reading today.   Not suspecting that I would be chosen, I entered a contest to win tickets to attend a reading by poets who were shortlisted to win the  urlLink Griffin Poetry Prize .   I won.    Initial reaction:  Yay! I won something!   (Right now you're thinking: geez, this girl is some crazed artsy-fartsy type who's going to go on and on about poetic form, provide you with some pretentious review of the poets' works, then tell you who she thinks should win the prizes and why, etc, etc. You are SO wrong...)    A couple minutes later:  Ummm...what am I going to do? I don't know much about poetry at all! I mean, there are some poems that I like, but I might be totally lost in there. I'd feel quite silly then, wouldn't I?  ---  I went to the poetry reading with my sister. I saw her dose off a couple times, but I stayed awake. I actually liked the experience as a whole, and even liked and appreciated (with my limited knowledge) some of the poems. Of course, a great deal went over my head, but hey, it was something new and it was free, so I'm not complaining.   Here's part of a poem that I enjoyed:   Whatever you meant to love, in meaning to  You changed yourself: you are not who you are,   Your soul cut moment to moment by a blade  Of fresh desire, the ground sown with abandoned skins.  And at your inmost circle, what? A core that is   Not one. Poor fool, you are divided at the heart,  Lost in its maze of chambers, blood, and love,  A heart that will one day beat you to death.   ~Excerpted from “Monologue for an Onion” published in Notes from the Divided Country: Poems by Suji Kwock Kim.

       From my cold, dead hands! ~ Charlton Heston at an NRA meeting held in Denver, Colorado, shortly after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999   After watching  Bowling for Columbine , I can't watch another Charlton Heston movie. Nevermind that he was Moses and is an oscar-winning actor - the man has loaded guns in his suburban, gated, most likely very highly secure home in LA. He says he feels safer that way.   Somtimes I just don't understand our "friendly" neighbours to the south.   Go and rent the movie - you'll discover a man - one-time cohort of Timothy McVeigh - who sleeps with a loaded gun under his pillow (again, because he feels safer that way), a woman who thinks that there are mostly white people in Canada, which she gives as her explanation as to why we don't have as many gun-related deaths here, and banks selling firearms...things that make you go hmmm...   While you're at it, go see Fahrenheit 9/11, another great Michael Moore film.   Mr. President, shame on you.  ---  I wonder if I'm going to get tagged by US Intelligence for saying that?
