       One of the suggested topics for our blogs was, "Where did you get started with your research for this assignment?  Was it hard to get going?"  I'm going to start off by answering the last question.    Yes, and heck yes.  Here's why.  I haven't been in any real situation that required any type of research since 1997.  I was a very poor researcher back then.  I see things do not change with time.  To begin with, I have never been one to invest much time into reading, or getting to know authors, so this has been uncharted ground for me.  I would try to recall what I learned of researching from HS, but I forgot all of that.  And it's been such a long time.  I've also never been one to put much stock into the person behind what I read, so writing an auto on a writer is definately not something I ever recall doing before.  Not well, atleast.  I guess I took that reader/writer relationship lesson and threw that in the trash.    I stated in the DB though, that essays and written papers were the best way to retain what is learned.  I suppose I have to back that comment up now.      To answer the second question, my first step was to search the internet.  What they say is definately true...  about the internet now being the largest source of information available to one person.  So true infact, that it almost makes the task of researching more difficult.  When you find 10,000 different sources of information, what do you pick from?  You try to pick the most important or most interesting information you can find.  It's really hard to pick that up from so many sources available.  So, now I'm hitting the books.  Atleast I'm more limited in sources there.  This should be an interest first assignment for me.

       This is my very own blog..  I hope.  I wasn't too thrilled to find that one of our very first assignments for this class was to write a blog, and that I had no idea what a blog was.  That wasn't very reassuring.  However, it was explained to me, and now I'm ready to rock and roll.

       Well, I appear to have over-extended myself on my topic.  Too much stuff to cover, and not enough time.  Nor the will or ability.  Instead, I guess I'm just going to break it down to repeat offenders, and how they are laughing at our legal system.  Seriously, they are.  To address the question you had earlier, I don't believe that prison space should even be an issue.  If you commit a crime, you do the time.  Joe Blow # 2 sees Joe Blow # 1 get his butt thrown in jail for a long time for robbery, Joe Blow # 2 suddenly has a lot more reserve about doing the same thing.  In contrast, Joe Blow # 2 usually sees Joe blow # 1 make a public mockery of the legal system by either getting a reduced sentence and/or probation.  Joe Blow # 2 suddenly feels pretty confident about his situation if he gets caught.  It absolutely drives me insane to think that there are convicted criminals out there in the streets, because the state didn't invest enough $$ into their prisons, while at the same time spending hundreds of thousands of $$ on freaking flowers for the highways.  Gosh dangit.

       The topic I have decided to cover for this assignment is involving criminal justice, and how it relates to our American legal system.  I believe it is a rather well shared opinion that the U.S. justice system is one of the most relaxed in the world.  As a result, we live in a society that experiences a considerable amount of senseless and immoral acts of crime and violence, inconsistant with other countries of comparable population statistics.  My intention is to inform the reader of these inconsistancies which I believe to be a BLARING warning sign, and to give them the information necessary to make the decision to support legislation involving stricter punishment for repeat offenders of the law, and laws that allow the prosecution of competent juvenilles.

            Apparantly what this ad is trying to lead the consumer to believe is that their product will give you so unbelievably beautiful skin (and help you become really attractive) that you'll be comfortable showing it off to the world.  At first I got the impression that they were trying to tell you that their soap gives you the awesome feeling that this woman seems to be experiencing, but I hope they'd give us consumers more credit then to believe that.  That, and the whole "Zest Spring Burst" part of the ad is all but invisible in the ad's graphics.         What you see here at first sight is an attractive model in an ad, covering her breasts in an attempt to convey to the audience that by using their product, you can be just as sexy.  I don't know about that though.  Obviously, we as humans aren't dumb enough to fall for that.  What this ad's really doing, is getting your attention with the naked woman.  Once it has your attention, it doesn't matter what you think about the product at that time, because once you hit the store, and you're looking for bath soap, Zest will be one of the brands in your mind, as you were attracted to their ad in the magazine by their naked woman.  It doesn't really matter if you ever intended to purchase their product.  It's a better marketing strategy then most might think.  Check out Geico for example.  Their commercials SUCK!! but their company name is easily remembered because of their SUCKY lame commercials.       I guess in this example you gave us, they did their job of hitting their target audience.  Who reads Rolling Stone?  In my opinion, mostly younger men who like to see naked or half-naked women.  There are also younger women who read the magazine, and they're just as likely to be grabbed by that ad as any man, as it's a very visually attention getting display.

       Stereotyping is defined as:   something conforming to a fixed or general pattern; especially : a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a group and that represents an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude, or uncritical judgment   In English that would translate to generalizing about a group of things or people.  Is it right or wrong?  Well, neither in my opinion.  All this hype about how it's wrong for people to stereotype, doesn't make sense to me.  Stereotypes are 99.99 of the times based off of some truth.  For example, the stereotype that Koreans eat kimchi, is a stereotype.  I'm Korean, my wife's Korean, and I was in Korea for 1 1/2 years while in the army, and yes..  I discovered that Korean's eat Kimchi.  While it might be a precursor for racism or other forms of discrimination, we are human, and it is within our nature to stereotype.  So, how can it be wrong?  For example, I'm not racist, and in no way is this a racist example, but it is a statistical fact that young black males in larger cities commit more violent crime then young white males.  The old famous question is, if you were walking down a street one night, and on one side was a group of young white kids, and on the other, a group of young black kids, which side would you take?  Me, I wouldn't care because I'm such a bad sonuvagun, but the question is expected to be answered in the white kids' favor.  Why?  Because it's a survival instinct.  Animals do it as part of their instinct.  Those tasty zebras would cross on the side with the donkeys on it rather then the lions.  Although all those lions don't want to eat them, it's more likely they'll encounter problems on their side.  It's a statistical fact.  If anybody tells that donkey he's being racist, they'd be nuts.   On the flip side, stereotyping can also be a negative thing.  For example, I've never had a problem with a group of people, black, white, yellow, or purple, but to cross the street on the other side because of a pre-conceived fear of what to expect, is quite a pity, because I have no way of knowing if the group of black kids don't happen to be some of the nicest people I would've met.  With this stereotype, I'd never give them the chance to prove that to me.  Being partly Korean, again using myself as an example, there's a stereotype that all the asian kids know karate or something.  Growing up in school, I was constantly hearing other kids make comments that I was a karate expert or something, with the occassion sound effect directed my way.  While, it might be flattering to me today to be thought of as a martial arts expert, as a kid, that wasn't very flattering, and it resulted in a distinct feeling that I was different.  Which I was.  But, boo hoo hoo...   ho hum.  I do understand that this example could be considered somewhat, if not very controversal, but I think it's a powerful example of stereotyping, and how it effects us.  Sorry, world.

       This Blog topic is an easy one for me.  I could probably detail my entire life right here if I had the time..  which I actually do have..  now that I quit my crappy job.    However, to talk about personal experiences considered outside the 'norm', you must first define what is normal.  Because normality is a subjective perception, that is quite an impossible task...   unless you look at social trends and behaviors as some sort of control group.  That's what we thought back in High School, I'm pretty sure.    Anyways.  I have to admit, I'm not one to go outside the norm that often.  Not in any way that the typical person on the street might notice.  I was raised in an extremely conservative family, in a conservative way, conservatively.  Based on that description, it seems obvious that I was the black sheep.  Maybe??  Maybe not.  My brother's turning out to be a screw-up from hell.  He just might be my saving grace, sadly enough.  If you really wanted an example of what I did that might be considered outside the norm, I would look at the time when I moved out from my parent's house at the age of 17, during the summer of my Junior and Senior years in HS.  The reason I use this as my example, is because I've already described the way I was raised.  I moved in with 3 other older guys I had known for a while into this big ugly college house.  We were so pitifully stupid at that time, I can't believe we came out alive.  At the end of that ordeal, which lasted about 7 months, I found myself in pretty bad shape.  I had dropped out of HS to ...  do God knows what (during my Senior year), which I guess was an equally sound reason to quit my job working at McDonalds flipping burgers.    Yeah, I wound up back home in no time.  To give the story a beautiful ending, I finished HS, got a haircut, and stopped sticking explosives up my nose.  The McDonalds job..  never got that back unfortunately.

       Possible blog entry # 1.    I don't have a particular word that sets me off, it's more a group of words.  If you've ever watched "Back to the Future", Marty McFly has a real problem with being call a chicken, yellow, or anything of the nature.  I'm part Asian, so I have my own little set-offs.  It's not so much the word, such as chink, gook..  whatever, but it's the meaning of it.  For a man to call me one of those words, would put me into such a rage I would have to be shot with tranquilizers.  Here's why.  Although, it's just a word, which of course is rather meaningless, it's a word intended to mock someone.  Call me any name in combination to the f-word, and I'll be ticked, but not insansely pissed off to the point of needing medication.  By calling me a chink for example, you're now telling me that I'm weak.  I'm so weak that you can call me such a degrating word and you don't think I'll do anything about it.  There's a thin white line in trash talking, and that's it right there.  That, and when you talk badly about someone's family...  or dog...   or gerbils.  That's why I'm so immature.  People call each other names to illicit a response.  AND I RESPOND!!!  It's not so much the definition of the word that sets me off.  It's the fact that you crossed that line, and have now shown muuuuuuuuch disrespect.  You die now!  It sounded good in my head, anyways.  Hmm...

       As a recommended blog topic, you asked us what we think of the idea of "English only".  I won't go on and repeat what's been said over and over again, by saying that the U.S. was not first inhabited by English speakers, therefore there is no basis for the notion that all American's should speak only English.  But, I did say it anyways.  Obviously language is a component of any culture.  You don't necessarily have to speak a language to reside in any country.  I believe that those who protest that anybody who can't speak English should not be allowed to live here are retarded.  Scientifically speaking.  It's my experience that almost every time I've heard such a statement being made, it was made by someone who was just inconvenienced by someone else's lack of English speaking skill.  For example, at McDonalds.  In my opinion, they made the negative remarks as a cover for their own embarassment.  They were unable to communicate effectively with the cashier, and instead of feeling awkward at the situation, they poke fun at him/her instead to either get a laugh, or to appear superior.  It's also part of the whole, "fear of anything different" concept that's going around.  However, I'd like to add that I have seen in my experience, that we as Americans are actually doing a rather good job of acception different people into our culture, as compared to many more conservative ones.  I believe the U.S. is doing it right.  You don't have to speak the language to live here, but you are required to have a basic understanding of it to become a citizen.  Afterall, language is part of the culture, and you are, by applying to become a citizen, accepting that culture.
