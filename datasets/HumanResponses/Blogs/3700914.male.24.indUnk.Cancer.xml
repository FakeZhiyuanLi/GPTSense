      Its just not god damned fair is it? Am I the only one whos sick as hell to see the same thing happen to an England side time after time after time... I can remember the pain of England v West Germany 1990 (still WEST GERMANY!) as Waddle and Pierce miss the penalties... the pain again against Germany in 1996 when Southgate (Bastard) missed... the pain against Argentina in France 1998 after another 2:2 draw and ANOTHER Sol Campbell goal disallowed! Ince and Batty could hardly be blamed; both being defensive midfielders who rarely netted anyhow, but BECKHAM and VASSEL!!!!!!!! thats the third consectutive penalty Beckhams fucked up for England! goddamnit ITs Not Fair.   And another thing. We fought on the same side as the French in the war did we not? So why the hatred and the glee at our failure?

      Yesterday was a special day for me. I will always remember its significance. Its strange how quickly perspectives can be forever altered. I'm not going to go into details, since I want this to serve as a reminder only for myself. hmmm . Who would've thought...  So anyway. Its done now.

      21st of June all over France; everyone goes out onto the streets into the centre and listens to hundreds of live bands of every type of music. Its a bit crazy, but its interesting and its different. We were at Place St Pierre for a while to watch the final round of the Euro Group stages... Fortunately both France and England went through... Before heading around town to Capitol, la Daurade and then back to Pierre. The roads in Toulouse are not wide so when you pack them full of people and kebab vans and guitars it holds things up a bit... as do the people who insist on trying to drive through the thousands into the mélé, and then wonder why people start climbing on their vehicle. The main act in Capitole was a bunch of middle-aged folk dressed in medieval attire led by a bald singer in a leotard and a keyboard toting man in a rabbit costume. Vive la musique français!

      Its a strange idea. Do I really know myself? Do I really want to? ... A time has come and I need to look at how far I've come and where I'm going. I'm a researcher, and I spend my time at work reading/websurfing/numbercrunching or generally just procrastinating. I do a lot of other stuff though, over 250km biking in the Dordogne this past weekend (!), football, cooking, Guiness, drawing, hmmm ... sleeping ...

      after reading michael moores 'Dude wheres my country' I finally see that it is not through a company I will achieve my ambitions in live. I, like most people aim to be rixh enough to live comfortably (already a bit vague that) but I can see no sense in following the hoards into industry, which is fundamentally always economically orientated. I think that the system does not allow for everyone to become what they desire, but like Moore, I see that people are easily tempted by get rich stories or company high risers...   Instead I think I want to do somethink on my own. Something new and innovative. My motivations are not exclusively for the better of mankind; I am being selfish in my goals. But moreover I think that if you want to become successful you have to go it alone, because the system is not a failsafe conveyor belt to glory. It just isn't that easy. Thats the problem...
