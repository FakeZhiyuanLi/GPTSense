      So, I realize that it has been a few days since my last post and I would like to say that I am sorry.  However, I would like to say that I will try to post at least three times a weeks.  Anyway here we go…  So today in computer lab, one of the kids had the brilliant idea of licking the computer screen of his computer.  Now, why this action would occur to anyone, I don't know, but it apparently came to be with this kid.  Perhaps for a minute, the kid had a lapse in judgement and began to hallucinate that the computer was a big bowl of food and knowing since daddy's food stamps only go so far, that he would simple dig in.  Or on the other hand, maybe the kid was just a dumbass trying to show off to his friends.  Well, I hope he gets gonorrhea and dies.  Anyway, as soon as the other kids in class started to spout off about this incidence, the teacher of the class responded by asking the kid why he did it.  When he did not answer her, she immediately through her hands up in the air and said (looking at me) their your computers, so you can deal with this.  Son of a Bitch! I wanted to say was, " well their your dumbass shitty kids ho, you fucking deal with it.  After all, that's what you're making the big bucks for right."  Besides, this is the same fucking teacher that had been out of the room (when she is supposed to be there) for over thirty minutes just ten minutes earlier.  That pisses me off, I am not a damn babysitter.  And if I was, I won't baby sit these shitty little sons of pukes.  I would rather shit fire and drink HIV infected blood from a catheter before I baby-sit these children of Satan.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate kids, but I do hate the lazy ass one's that like to fuck with my shit.  In the end, it just pisses me off that this teacher couldn't take responsibility for her kids.  I also was upset that I waa put on the spot to react to something like that.  Oh well… I guess I really shouldn't write stuff like this in my blog, cause after all, it could probably get me fired.  Anyway.. This wasn't the best update, but I guess it will have to work for now….. That's it for now… ta ta

      If Warner brothers makes the superman script that I just read the synopsis for, then the suicide rate in this country will sky rocket.  And if Vin Diesel ends up as lex luthor, then I will drink diesel fuel and lite myself on fire.  At this rate, I would rather troma productions take over the movie. At least I could look forward to superman fighting the toxic avenger and the Sgt. Kabukiman.  They could even change his history so that he came from nukem high and that would still be better than the crap that JJ Abrams wrote.  I'm sure JJ is a nice writer, but he sure knows how to fucker up a superman movie.  So for all the kiddies that wants to know gather around and I will give you the skinny on the script.  First off, it must be said that I don't hate or dislike JJ Abrams.  After all, he brought us felicity and the goddess known as Kerri Russell.  Anyway, here are the highlights.  1. The fighting will be done in a matrix kung fu style 2. Lex Luthor will work for the CIA UFO division and will later unveil himself as an alien as well 3. Krypton does not explode 4. A non comic book villain, who was created for the movie, by the name of tyzor, is used. 5. They kill superman and bring him back to life with a scene where Jor-el, superman fathers, convinces him in the after life to come back alive. 6. They refer to jimmy olsen as gay 7. They change how clark is found.  Instead of them finding him while they are driving, he basically nearly crash into there house with a space ship. 8. By what I could tell, lois lane has no character development. 9. And the movie ends with superman duping it out with Lex  All this added to together equals a great shittastical fun time. Why oh why do they not use a good villain from the comic book or related well-known mythos.  What about the Eradicator, Mongul, Darksied, Bloodsport, and even doomsday?   There is even a character named imperiox that could for the most part fit perfectly in this overall story.  I also hate that every adaptation of a screenplay I run across tends to try to dump lex luthor down.  The whole point of his dynamic with superman was that he could intellectual take him on.  Mind vs. Power.  Also Lex is in a business world that allows him some immunity from supes….. ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!  Why is it, that every time a movie is written for a superhero, that they must revisit the origin of the character?  Everyone knows where supes came from…. I could write a script where the origin could be told in five minutes… how hard is that…. It's called a montage… where information is quickly presented to bring the viewer up to track… anyway.. I must go.. I have lunch now… I'll be back for more later.. FASHIZZLE!

      I seriously believe that at this moment, that teachers should be allowed to insult their students.  For instance, when a little girl, who has repeated the third grade four times looks up at me with her pudgy doe eyes and says, " this program is boring " or " I don't know how to do this."  And this is in despite of the fact that the directions are right there in front of her crack laced eyes.  I just want to say " Shut up you lazy as retard, I have had shits that were smarter than you.  Now get to work Bertha."  But no, I never can have that pleasure, and that is why I hate working at a school.  If natural selection was the option here, we would be dragging these poor pathetic little pieces of dung out to the street and shooting them.  There are those times that I wish I was the guy in Dead Alive, so that I could walk in one day with a lawnmower and puree their asses.  Baby back ribs anyone.  Okay I jest… besides this would probably be considered low quality beef.  And there are the teachers…. I have this one that for the life of me can't remember my last name…. I believe she has called me every last name in the book…. Yes I have told her my name… I have even interrupted her in the middle of calling my name to tell her it…  Maybe I should carve it into her forehead like henry bowers does to Ben Hanscom in IT…. I mean seriously…  And there is this other teacher, who for some reason always treats me like a child.  This frankly annoys the piss out of me, but she is hot.  And I mean with a capital H… but she is still annoying… I wish I could just smack her around a little and tell her to suck it…. Oh well… I guess in the end, this job is not that bad.  However, it does have its negatives.  Oh well, it could be worse and I could be working at publix.  Well that's it for now. fashizzle

      The following review contains no spoilers  So last night, I saw Spiderman 2 at my local six-plex and I have to say that it was simply amazing.  The movie is a brilliant collaboration of filmmaking that captures the imagination of your everyday comic book fan boy and transports him off to that fantastic childhood world of neverland. (Not the Michael Jackson one which should really be called molest land)  From the opening get go of the movie, the crowd took what would be a big excited inhale of air and never thought about releasing it until the multiple orgasmic climatic ending was over.  (Imagine that as a tagline: This movie is one Multiple orgasmic joyride to the very end.  HA! )  I can honestly say that I enjoyed every last minute of it and I was simply a jittering mess when the whole things was said and done.  The filmmakers did a masterful job in expanding on the first film with supped up special effects and a concrete script that could leave any comic book writer jealous.  I have to give two thumbs up to Sam Raimi, who over the course of the movie flexed his superior directing muscle with elaborate fight scenes and very versatile scenes of emotion that brings the viewer ever so closer to the heart of the characters.  Sammy (as I like to call him) also introduced a small portion of himself to the mainstream audience with his well-known Evil Dead esque film style, with a scene that left the everyday Jo schomo trimbling at bay.  (We will just say that Doc Ock with a Chainsaw was quite possibly the most horrific but enjoyable scene of all.)  Tobey Magiure was fantastic with his pectoral muscles of steel….. uggghhhhh! Wait… he was just super… forget that pectoral thing.  Kirsten Dunst showed a nice versatile range of acting while at the same time fulfilling every fan boy's imagination of MJ, and leaving them with a wonderful creamy sensation of fun in there pants.  Yes, this movie was all that and a bag of chips on top.  Webslinging fun at immense proportions that lefts the viewer to a level of readiness for a sequel.  The most impressive element of this movie, was the fluid nature in which the camera was able to capture the scene of action.  The flow was seamless as well as inventive in a nature that allowed the viewer to feel as though they were actually reading a Spiderman comic (a.k.a. graphic novel for those who wish to call it that) I give this movie four and three quarter stars our of five.  So after the movie was over and I finished vibrating from excitement like a giant sized motorized dildo, I proceeded over to Wal-Mart with a few friends.  Oh how I feel sorry for them, because I was blabbering on like a little girl in an ice cream shop.  Spiderman this and Spiderman that.  And on this journey of a drunken ecstasy high of adrenaline, I proceed to by the Spiderman 2 video game, which is out now for the PS2. (See that little advertisement…. I will be expecting a residual check anytime now…. Or at least a free product… I mean come on…) Anyway, if the movie is anywhere near as exciting an fun as the movie was, I will never have to masturbate again.  Ahhhhhh… the joy….  Meanwhile at work: I have discovered that there is this extremely disgusting thing that little girls like to call hair gel.  Yes this stuff is sick and just be glad you have never had the pleasure of picking up a pair of headphones that has this shit all over it.  I mean come on, this stuff gets everywhere, I have once encountered a puddle of it on the back of a chair and yes, it looks like someone jizzed all over the top of the chair.  It's gross as hell.  I bet you that if I were to throw a match in the vicinity of one of these girls that they would probably burst into flames..  Could you imagine, one little girl running around screaming with fire on the top of her head, while ambers from the fire set other girls hair on fire?  It would be like a mini bond fire…. I could bring some Oscar Myers wieners to make.  (I like my human barbecued)  Seriously though, I don't know how they will make it through the July fourth weekend.  (Officer Sanchez, we have a group of children on fire, please respond)  Anyway, the other thing I have learned about working at a school is that sometimes when a teacher (who you don't like) goes on holiday, and is gone for a few days, it is really easy to hope and pray that someone has popped a cap in her ass.  This is mean to say, but I really wish there was a duck tape law in which, if a teacher is being a mega bi'otch, that you can duck tape her sorry ass up and dump her off the nearest bridge.  Could you imagine?  Literally I have to admit that when this teacher talks, I just want to vomit acid into her face like I was an alien.  (Think about that scene in stand by me when everyone is vomiting on each other.)  A Niagara level of vomiting fun.  Okay, I'm sorry, I just went too far….. Or did I?… huh….. At this moment I will take a moment to spout my disclaimer.  This journal is an expression of free speech.  It is also a depiction of my thoughts and emotions at the time I am venting.  It is a no hold bars affair and if my profanity or opinions offend you, then get the fuck out.  Now that is said and done….. I am really not a bad person….  I just want a place where my thoughts are not censored by society.  Sometimes the emotions I depict are just for a moment and I use them for comedic value.  So if you are reading this, that how this journal at all times should be taken…. Oh well.. That it for now… Take it easy until next time….

      Hello everyone….. Sweet Tea is back in the hiznizzle…… So I realize that it has been like a million years since my last post, but I have been busy stressing over my last two college classes… it is only now that I have had a chance to breath…  Okay, so let's recap the last few weeks….  I saw three movies over this time… the bourne supremacy, I robot, the village…  The Bourne Supremacy, was an absolute disappointment…. As a fellow poster posted in his blog, the movie failed to capture my attention and I gained no emotional damage towards the lost of a major plot character.  The movie was also overdriven with complicated spy and espionage stuff.  I think sometimes they try to do this to make the movie look smarter than it really is in real life, but all they achieved was to make a confusing movie that never seemed to go anywhere important.   Why should I car that Jason Bourne can't remember everything he has done.  Also, I think the filmmakers forgot that the first movie was predominately an action movie the first time around.  There were lots of fights and a reasonable plot that you could keep up with.  This movie had some fighting, but it also had more of a clunky story that seemed like it should have been over half way through the movie.  I,Robot, despite my initial concern about this picture, this one actually ended up okay.  After all, it is what it is a CGI action movie designed to pander to a younger generation….  This would in many was be a good date movie… it's got the jumps and the bumps that will at least make you happy for a few minutes.  Next the Village, this was not a bad movie at all.  It was slow, but that's all right.  Most people probably hated it for being slow, and I could honestly say that when I saw it opening night, that the majority of the audience was disappointed with it afterwards.  I think they were thinking it was going to be a hip cool slasher like pick.  And the truth is, it probably would have been all right like that as well.  However, slasher flick, is not M Night's specialty.  I also think a lot of people living angry because they are tricked through the movie to believe one thing and then at the end it is different.  This type of film also set up the audience for a let down.  Oh well, I think M Night did a good job, but I don't think he is the next steven spielberg.  Now the only major complaint that I had through out the village was the audience.  I just don't understand why people have to be such dicks with the habits.  For instance, there was this young lady who came into the movie with here family and here one-year-old child.  Now first off, this is a rated R movie, next the child will never remember this movie either.  But of course they brought the child and you know what it did?  It cried the entire fucking movie.  Not just a little, but a lot.  And did the mother ever consider leaving the theater with the child.  Nope, absolutely fucking not.  I swear, that this is were lake city can become extremely annoying, because no one and I mean no one had the balls to complain.  I will say that I should have complained, but I never had the guts, plus I was in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes I wish I had grenades to through at these people and their stupidity, but life can't be that fun.  The was also this little incident with a lady and her cell phone.  I wish these would just die.  I wish that the movie theater had a button in the back of the room attached all the sets.  And when some gets out of line… sap… barbecued chicken anyone.  Oh well!  I also don't understand how stupid people are… for instance… I had a group of younger kids sit behind me at first when we got there… well I am a tall person.. and I was in my set first, but they still decided to sit behind me.. and all I could here was how this one kid was unhappy about sitting behind me.  You know, I all I wanted to do was turn around a shove my wang chung into his face and say suck it… just to shut him up.. anyway.. not that I have managed to make this blog yet dirty again… I will leave you with that.. Bye for now.
