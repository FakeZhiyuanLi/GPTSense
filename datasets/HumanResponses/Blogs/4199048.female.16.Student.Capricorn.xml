        I don't know what is compelling me to write this but I feel like if I do, I might feel better. I honestly don't even know who I am writing to right now and if anyone is actually going to read this, but writing it down might make me feel better. Well, anyways, I'm a diabetic. I would like to say that I am not a normal diabetic. I am 16, and only found out about my diabetes a little over a year ago. The thing that sucked most about it was that I was already into the swing of things. The way I lived my life was already set. I drank, I smoked, I partied. But, over the course of a few random weeks last spring, I started feeling weird. I peed all the time, I drank water like it was my job, I slept more than I had in my whole life and I felt like shit. I honestly thought I was fine, I didn't even think anything was wrong with me until my vision went. I didn't even tell my mom because I thought it happened from going tanning without the goggles on. But, eventually, when it got so bad I couldn't see 4 feet in front of me, I told her. A day after her birthday, she took me to the doctor to find sugar in my pee. Not a good sign. I was admitted into the hospital and from then on I was a diabetic. In the hospital, I did not cry once. To tell you the truth, I didn't really care. I am not squeemish about blood, I've wanted to be a doctor my whole life. The shots were alright, It didn't really faze me. My nurses actually told me they thought it was real bizarre the way I was handling it. My family flipped out, I was the only one who held it together. I was in the hospital for two days of "diabetic training": learning how to do my shots, what happens when I go low, when I go high, etc. It was easy. I didn't care, it was just something new for me to deal with. Not to sound all dramatic and shit but I have seen a lot in 16 years. I can deal with the hand that's dealt pretty well. Well anyways, I dealt with everything alright. I recognized lows and highs and basically became a diabetic. Except, of course, to the fact that I didn't change my lifestyle all that much. I mean, when I went out, I drank and smoked and partied and all that. But, I switched to light beer, I switched to light cigarettes and I kept the weed to a minimum. I am not a loser going no where with my life, either. I get good grades, I have good friends, I have sober friends,  I just enjoy the party scene. So don't get any ideas. But anyways, I went through the whole diabetes thing with a smile on my face and a fucking needle in my leg, stomache, arm, wherever. And honestly, it hasn't been til recently when I've started to realize how much this fucking sucks. I hate the fact that people are ignorant to it. Some people have absolutely no idea what it is. I hate the fact that I have to get special treatment. I don't want special treatment. I don't want a fucking MedicID bracelet. I don't want to be able to leave class without telling anyone. I don't want to have to be pricked and prodded every three fucking months with needles by people who know just as much as I do about my disease. I don't want to go to my doctor and find out there's something wrong with my heart, which, by the way, is probably one of the billion things that is going to go wrong wiht me in this lifetime. The fact that I have to worry about my sight, my kidneys, my nervous system, my liver, my appendages, whatever.. is bullshit. And honestly, I don't even know where this is coming from. Anyone reading this is going to think I'm some psycho, depressed girl. If you were to meet me, I am nothing like how I sound here. I just needed somewhere to get this out. I just want someone to read this and hopefully know where I'm coming from. Because I sure as hell don't know how to stop feeling so mad about this. I have so much anger built up from a year of not saying anything that I could explode right here in front of my computer. It took me a year to cry. A fucking year. I feel like I'm having a midlife crisis at 16. So, if anyone were to read this, seeing where I'm coming from, post something (I hope you can do it on this thing) because it would really help me out. I just need to figure out some way of dealing. And don't worry (not like any of you know me enough to worry about me) I am not a cutter, I don't self-mutilate, I don't express anger with pain. But, whoever you are, thank you for listening. I really appreciate it.
