And when I get back to TX, can finally start posting my "Pic's of the Week!!" (With the added help of John of course).

      Hello. I've got some bad news for all my fans (if any). But my "Pics of the Week" will NOT be shown weekly. They will be shown once in a while. Meaning at random days. The reason is, my friend John is the only one that can put my pics on my blog, and it is going to get tiresom (check spelling) after a while. In other news, nothing special happend today, and if you think my blog is kool, then IM me at SonicRTR or Sonic8991. DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!  and if you think my blog ISN'T kool well guess wat, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK!!!!!

      DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Yesterday, I got back in TX!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAY!!! But unfortunanly, it was a chaotic trip. I first had to wake up at around 7 a.m. and I had to fly to Chicago and then I could go to TX. But when I was in Chicago me and my brother, Kyle, went to look for our termanal. However, the ticket did not say what termanal to go to. So, we asked for directions, and we found our termanal. But then, the speaker came on and said that our flight was delayed AND changed to a differ termanal. So, my and my bro had to walk, literaly, across the airport to get to our new termanal. When we finally got there, we waited aboot half an hour!! Then the speaker came on AGAIN and sayed our flight got delayed and changed AGAIN!!! So, we ONCE AGAIN walked, literally, across the airport, AGAIN!!! Then we finally got on the plane, BUT, when on the plane, the pilot got on the speaker and sayed that there was some technical difficulties and could not lift off for another half an hourk!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!! Then finally the thing was fixed and we were off. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the pilot says that there is a huge thunder storm in direct path of the route, and we had to go completly around the HUMONGOUS CLOUD OF DOOM!!! And that put on aboot another hour to our flight!!!! But finally we got home around 9 p.m. and I unpacked and whent to bed.  Today, I'm having Levy over for some catching up. To bad John couldn't. *sobs* Ohhhh well.   and if you think I had a bad day. Well......your right. And at the same time, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK!!!!!!
