      May 31, 2004  Today was my first day at the J. Crew Retail store, as well as my first brush with a very different mindset than I have come in contact with.  Growing up in the south, it seemed to me that everyone went to church, if not on a semi-regular basis, at least on Easter and Christmas.  Everyone in the south at least knows “who” Jesus was or at least could quote John 3:16 due to a very vague run in with vacation Bible school years ago. In my very brief 7 hours spent with some Baltimoreans, I have learned that there is a HUGE difference between what lies below the mountain line of Virginia and what lies above it.    I work with a young man who, after hearing what it is that I am up here for, told me that he had done some missionary work himself…for the Church of Latter Day Saints.  I honestly think he was thinking that he and I are “missionarying” for the same God.  Either that or he was looking for a particular reaction from me.  It was right then that I realized that I wasn’t in “Kansas” (AKA: the Bible Belt) anymore.  I also quickly realized how sheltered I have been throughout my life.  Yeah, I have experienced this, that, and the other, but I have yet to come in contact with so many people who are SO naive to the presence and existence of God.  I honestly wonder if this little, southern, preacher’s kid can relate to and connect with people who have absolutely no idea who God is.  I wonder if I am called to be more like Peter and minister to the “Jews” (Churchgoers) instead of like Paul, who ministered to the “Gentiles” (non-churchgoers/"I don’t know who in the heck God is" crowd).    As I read through Acts, I really see a parallel b/t the church and her surrounding community of then and now.  The New Testament church was being birthed into a society that was used to different religions and ideas popping up, so to many in the community, this “new religion” was just another way to get to a form of heaven, utopia, or peace of mind.  The new Body had to prove itself to be set apart or different from the rest of the emerging or even stable religions.    This is where I get unsure and “uncomfortable”.  I have personally walked through the halls of church since before I was born and could tell you how to “play” the game known as church.  I could write you out the rule book, then tell you how to cover up this, that, and the other in order to make sure you win and you come out looking/smelling like a saint, no matter what the truth really is.  I can tell you what masks to where in front of what type of people and teach you how to smile at the person you hate and then turn around and cut them to pieces with your tongue, once you have said your parting blessings, of course.  Yep, I got the church game down.  However, this is not what people want, not here anyway, and from what I can tell so far, not in the book of Acts either.  I truly believe that the NT church grew so quickly b/c of the honesty and authenticity they experienced when they came face to face with their Creator/Savior.  This is the type of meeting that I had after I mastered the game so well.  And I’ll be dagum (good southern word) if I didn’t have to completely rewrite my rule book, ok, I had to burn the thing.  There was absolutely nothing in it that had ANY relevance to the true Christian life.  I spent years perfecting my moves and strategies in this game only to learn that I had it ALL wrong.  This is what I now know:  Christ and Christ alone paid my penalty for my sins.  There is nothing more I can do to make me anymore saved than I already am.  Colossians 2:20-23 says:  20 You have died with Christ, and he has  set you free  from the evil powers of this world. So why do you keep on following rules of the world, such as, 21 "Don't handle, don't eat, don't touch." 22 Such rules are mere human teaching about things that are gone as soon as we use them. 23 These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, humility, and severe bodily discipline.  But they have no effect when it comes to conquering a person's evil thoughts and desires .  I think it was the last part of verse 23 that really stuck in my mind.  All these things I did in order to please people were a way to show those that could see nothing but my outward appearance that all was good on the inside, when in reality I was not conquering my evil thoughts and desires.  My life was full of secret sins that no one could know about or they would think the worst of me and I would lose the game.    Fortunately, Christ has opened my eyes to his truth and the reality of the freedom he bestows upon me.  Now, it looks as though I will be learning how to take what it is that I know to be true and live it in front of people.  One thing has to be in common of both “Jews” and “gentiles”, they are seeking for purpose, they are seeking for reason, and therefore, they are seeking for their Creator.

      I knew this day would come eventually.  I mean, it was a big part of the reason I came here.  I knew that I would have to lead worship at Horizon all alone, by myself, with no one else (ok, maybe with another guitar).  I just didn't think it would come TWO WEEKS AFTER I GOT HERE!!!!!    To give some background; a couple that met at Horizon, got married yesterday, in Georgia.  Due to the fact that both the bride and the groom were very much loved by many in the church, a good 75% of the congregation made their way down south for the wedding.  This included anyone who has ever led worship at Horizon.  Due to the fact that I never met the groom and only met the bride a handful of times, I was nominated to stay behind and lead worship.  "No biggy", most of you might say.  "You've done this plenty of times, Beth Ann, what's the problem?"  Well the problem is my lack of confidence in playing the guitar, especially with another person.  That whole "we gotta stay in time thing" really stinks sometimes. (J/K)  Due to the fact that I am a vocalist first THEN a guitar player, I tend to let the rhythm of my voice dictate my strumming pattern on the guitar. (all you non-musicians stay with me for just a bit longer, this will all make sense very soon, I promise.)  This lack of a steady rhythm drives REAL guitar players, and any other instrumentalist, crazy and makes me very frustrated.  I was somewhat apprehensive when Josh told me that I would be leading today.  I know what this congregation is used to.  Josh is an amazing worship leader and musician and the rest of the band is as well.  I knew there was absolutely no way out of this, so I said "No problem, Josh.  We'll be fine!"   So, today I woke up and spent a couple of hours with the Lord, got ready and promptly arrived at church to begin set up.  I WISH!!!!  I woke up at 8:47am and FREAKED OUT!!!  I was supposed to be in Towson (15 to 20 minutes away from where I live) by 9:00.  I threw on some jeans and a t-shirt (sorry dad), ran wet hands over my hair, grabbed my make-up bag and guitar and RAN out the door.  I made it by 9:13.  There was no traffic on the beltway, that's why I made it so fast.  It had ABSOLUTELY nothing to due with how fast I was going. Really! ;-)   Arriving for a worship services frazzled and a mess does things to you, especially when you are the worship leader.  All my fears of inadequacy came rushing in throughout sound check.  It is times like these I have come to realize that I have two choices: 1) be paralyzed with this fear, or 2) allow God to do what He does best and just shine through me.  Thankfully today, I chose the latter.  I wish I could say that my guitar playing miraculously changed and I was playing just as good as any other worship leader.  It actually was about the way it always is.  The difference is, I knew I was doing my best for my King.  In reality, that's all He asks of us.  Now don't get me wrong, His acceptance of us does not give us license to live freely in the life of mediocracy, it just allows us the chance to grow in and from our mistakes.    One might ask, "Beth Ann, what are you going to do about your guitar playing?".  Well, I'm glad you asked.  I start guitar lessons tomorrow with a jazz guitar major that goes to our church.  God has once again blessed me with a way to better my gift so that, through the gifts He has given me, I can better bring glory to His name.  It is so awesome to watch how God constantly puts you into situations that challenge you, push you, pull you, stretch you, and in the end, perfect you.  God, once again, proved that not only can I do all things through Him, but that I am not all by myself.  Thank you, Jesus!

      On Wednesday night, the Horizon gang got together at the local Pizza Hut for a night of fun fundraising.  The Horizonites are playing a game much like Donald Trumps "Apprentice".  I don't understand it or really know much of what is going on.  All I know is a bunch of people that I wanted to hang out with went out for pizza...so I went.  I mean really, what could be better...friends and pizza...ahhhh!   Anyway,  Below are a few pics of the evening.  Just wanted you guys to see the people I hang with.  They're pretty cool.

      Below are a few pictures from the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; We threw a party for Josh's b-day on June 18th and had some friends from Lynchburg come up and hang.&nbsp; I love it when people come to visit me here and see what it is that I am investing my life in.&nbsp; I honestly couldn't imagine being anywhere else in the the world.&nbsp; It's funny, most of you know how much I want to go to Ireland and how that has been a desire of mine for years.&nbsp; I can honestly say, that if I had to choose between going to Ireland for the summer and going to Maryland to work with Horizon for the summer, I would choose Horizon.&nbsp; There's an excitement here that can't be explained.&nbsp; There's an undercurrent of the Spirit of God that is getting this area ready for something big.&nbsp; I only have 4 weeks left and that saddens me deeply.&nbsp; BUT, I, for the first time, know what it is that I, specifically, want to do with my life in ministry.&nbsp; That, in and of itself, creates an excitement for going back to school and getting the classes and education that I need to come back to Horizon and pour into this body.  I wish all of my friends and family could come and see what God is doing here.&nbsp; I want them to see what He's doing in the lives of twentysomethings who have all but been written off to laziness and the inability to commit.&nbsp; There's a fire and a passion in these twentysomethings that I have rarely seen.&nbsp; They're not being told that they are the church of tomorrow and they need to wait for that day to come.&nbsp; They ARE the church and her leaders NOW.&nbsp; Their passion to see their friends, family, and co-workers come to know of a relationship with Christ is moving.&nbsp; Their desire to do anything to make sure that happens is even more amazing.&nbsp; I am blessed to be here.&nbsp; I am honored to be used by God here.&nbsp;   Please pray for Horizon.&nbsp; Pray for us deeply.&nbsp; Pray for the staff: Dave Cowan, Clay Carver, Josh Smith, Leslie Webster, and Mark Stephenson.&nbsp; I have been amazed by each of them and honored to be in their presence.&nbsp; Pray for our finances, in the words of Ulysses Everett McGill, "We're in a tight spot."&nbsp; God has provided thus far and we all know He will continue to provide.&nbsp; Pray that we will be able to reach our communities in a relavent way.&nbsp; Pray that God will continue to raise leaders up within Horizon so that we can continue to multiply ourselves out and grow.  God has His hand on this movement called Horizon.&nbsp; I have been here for 1 1/2 months and I have been in awe at the stories I have heard and even been apart of.&nbsp; God is doing something here.&nbsp; I am blessed, honored, and amazed that I have been chosen to be apart of it.&nbsp; Thank you, Jehovah, for choosing me.
