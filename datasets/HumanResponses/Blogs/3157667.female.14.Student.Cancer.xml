      today was pretty uneventful. we went 2 the VLAs, which were kinda boring. they wouldn' have been so bad if we didn't have 2 fill out some dumb worksheet. the drive there was like 2 hours, and everyone took their shoes off and all of our feet stunk. then we stopped at mcdonald's on the way home, and some of us went in the little playplace. ahh, you never get too old for those things. so yeah. there's nothing much else 2 say. personally, i think this website thingy is reeeeally stupid. but o well, it's kinda fun in its own stupid way. but yeah, i probably won't post anything every day, because i have a life, unlike some people. adios.

      howdy! i'm writing 2 days in a row, how amazing. not really. but so anyways i'm pretty bored. i still don't think very many ppl know about my blog. except for midori, lucy, meghan, kelley, devin, damian, and teal. but yeah oh well. spread the word! lol but yeah so in about an hour i am going 2 the airport to pick up my friend jenna who is visiting from az. hopefully i see someone i know at the airport while i am waiting, that's always fun. yeah and u know what else? i just watched the 1st harry potter movie the other day, and none of the kids can act! it's so funny! they're gotten better by this 3rd one, but it reminds me of  the adventures of claire and evan  that my cousins and i used to make when we were little. just like the way they ran around looked so staged and everything. but oh well. i doubt i would be much better. so on another note, it REALLY RAINED at my house last night. did it rain at everybody elses? it's actually pretty funny that it finally rained on the day my dad was going 2 irrigate with the ditch. but he didn't because of the rain. yeah so i just realized something depressing! the summer is slipping away from us! i mean, do u guys realize that in a couple of days june will be over? and then we only have 2 months and then we'll be freshmen! ahhhhh we're gonna make terrible freshmen. hahaha but oh well. we'll be dorky but who cares. anyhoo... i am going to go take a shower now. so leave me a comment!!! u can leave comments by clicking where it says comments next to the time where it is written at the bottom of this post! and unless u have a blog, u have 2 comment annonymously, but u can still leave ur name. lol have fun and i will write later! when i come back i want some comments!

      hey all, gimme some comments! yeah so i guess i have 2 let mppl know about my blog more often, because only a few ppl know about it! how sad. but yeah so anyways, i really don't have anything interesting to say. so i'll shut up now. i'm on the phone with meghan right now, and she says that i should add my lamb poem from 7th grade into my blog. normally i wouldn't but since i have nothing else to say, here goes: this is the only line i remember:  "the baa of a sheep is the cry of an angel!"  meghan is now being very annoying. she is saying that we are like romy and michele in romy and michele's high school reunion. she says i'm romy. she says she's michele. but she isn't as stupid as michele. i don't think anyways. right now she's saying "write about meeeeeeee in your blog write about meeeee" and she's also saying "i'm getting a horsie i'm getting a horsie i'm getting a horsie." ha ha i love giving meghan a hard time. anyways, i'm gonna go now. adios.

      good afternoon my tiddliewinks. that sounded really stupid. but who cares. i am so excited to see spiderman 2!! it looks good. yum. but yeah so anyways... jenna is in town now and we aren't doing anything very special. although today we went 2 santa fe and we made hollyhock dolls and gave them 2 ppl and left them in random places, like the atm machine. and then we left them on the steps of the ups truck while the guy was delivering stuff. and then we saw him again and left him more dolls. it was really funny because he put them all up on his dashboard. there were like 5 dolls by the end of it. it really was more fun than it sounds. honest. well i'd better go now. more writing later then. adios.
