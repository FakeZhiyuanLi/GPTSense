      Hello out there! Tonight tonight I am having a crazy West Side Story moment tonight! Wow well now that that is over lets get to the latest news! Ok so tonight (tee hee) I had a soccer game, and everything was going dandy ( a word that rhymes with Sandy which reminds me of Grease which makes me do this, Oh Sandy Baby someday when highighschool is done!) o wow sorry! Anyways things were going uh...good, when I had to go in net and I was nervous and I didn't like it but I did farely well, if you think stopping 5 and leting in 2 is good, frankly I do so there you negitve Nancy! Anyways it is Tuesday tomorow. I have to go shopping and buy stuff for my friend who shall remain nameless due to she doesn't know about said lets go with "get together." Earlier I made food ate it and felt sick.I started reading the next in the line of books that makes me laugh so hard I pee, but not really of coarse I am a lady, and ladys don't wet themselves...in public. I am full of skittles at the moment and I think that that is a bad idea, due to the fact that o mother dear is making pizza. I will eat some and that will make me sick I can tell, but I am going to do it anyways. It is my friend Kurtis' birthday on Wednesday (if that is the 30th) I think that it is. Today is an election, so in honor of that I am going to start another pole. What movie with Orli is better? Troy (he wears a skirt and at one point in the nuddy pants ((or in englais naked)) ) Or Pirates of the Carribean ( He is all manly like with the swords and the swashbuckling! OOO la la!) I miss Eva and Taryn already, and Sarrah where in the name of Dan are You!!!(FYI: Dan is our makeshift God I being a member of this religion if you will am called a Daniete. Sarrah is the starter. I love her!)Well I am getting over heated and cranky. So I must leave you. Hoccha. Author: Eve

      Hey readers of my blog, if there are any! lol o depressing thought, what if no one ever reads this? Before I get totally depressed lets move on! Ok so I just got back from Evas dance recital it was tres tres good. Eva you are a dancing queen! haha Taryn I am almost positive that she is still virginal! I ate a McFlurry as well very fattening, very worth it! Tomorow is the Park Societys goodbye meeting, not that we are breaking up, oh no never will that happen! I will now give you my opinion on Bjork, you may not want it, but meh I don't really care. She is a funny lady.She enjoys her sulfer and Her songs are very good. She has a pretty voice and I think if the Spice Girls (whom I loved as a young lass, as well as now) should invite her to come and take Geri's spot! Oh was I ever mad when Geri left! I think if I can recall correctly that I cried, well mabey it was more of a blubbering wheezing sort of deal! Ha ha Well I am off Roast Chicken awaits me, which is a good thing I like it!

      It is me Eve. I just got home from grocery shopping and I am listening to Muse, if you don't know who they are you should definatly check them out they are amazing. They sound a little like Radiohead but mixed in with the  Vines.I would say they are the vines on crack, but in all fairness, the vines probably are on crack, I mean have you seen Craig Nichols? Anyways back to the grocery shopping, have you ever noticed how it can make you hungry like hell? Well it can and it does, cuz now I can not wait for dinner to come. Tomorow is Evas dance recital with Taryn, so I have to go to the early church, which means I can not go out tonight! Bah that maked me MAD! I am not one to hold grudges, so I will get over it relativly soon. Today I was sitting on my deck reading a book that made me laugh quite hard. Its Brittish which just makes it better. I am in the mood for a really sad movie. I really want to see the notebook, friends of mine who have seen it already (because it only came out yesterday you see)have been giving it the thumbs up. I also need to go see Harry Potter, I mean that has taken me FOREVER!!! I can not wait for Evas cottage total days to go:15. Monday I think that the park society that consists of Eva Robert Justin and myself will have a picnic to say buhbye to the female members seeing as it will be difficult for us to have a meeting for a little while with vacationing and all. Today I watched the NHL entry draft. Hockey players are hot.Which brings me to my first blog poll. Who is the hotter set of athletes? Hockey players, or soccer players? I mean both are hot but who reighns supreme? Well we will decide this in the weeks and month to come I think but now I must be off, my hunger has become over whelming!Hoccha Author:Eve

Natalie you are Pocahontas, and don't ever let anyone tell you different! Don't worry its just my stomache, it goes all the way up!Tonight was fun I liked it! I have some parting words awell. Alex good luck in your soccer dealie, and Days until evas cottage which will be UBER fun is:16! I am excited, again I will leave you with the word Hoccha (who knows, this may be permanent!)

      This is the first Friday of summer. I like summer. Summer means no school,Evas cottage,The Park Society, and most of all ice cream. I know you can eat ice cream all year round, but it is just more fun in the summer, don't you think? No, O well I do, and since I am the author of this here blog that is the only opinon that matters, not that I don't give you cootos(is that how you spell that word? I am D.Y.lexic you know I can not tell these things.) I want my friend Sarrah to come home for summer, she promised she would. which means she has to. This has been a waste of a day. I am going to see a movie tonight,lets hope that will be fun. My post seems to be all over the place lets hope this does not continue in the future.If it does I would like to apoligise right here and now. So now that that is said, this post must come to and end.Hoccha is a phrase i will close with. Author-Eve.

      So Friday, Eva and I went out for Coffee, after my family left. That was nice. I tried to sing the Fish and Chips and Vinegar song, but this is what came out. Cish and Fips and Ginager, and then Eva chimed in with Woffer pop! Why our doors are not being beaten down by record companies I don't know! So then yesterday, being Saturday Eva and I had to drop off the bikes Taryn brought to the cottage so we stopped for coffee, and had a gay old time.(I mean gay in the ha ha way, not in the well you get the picture!) Eva, Taryn and I just sat by the pool for a while talking about Taryns first real love. Brent. All I have to say is... WHO GETS STABBED IN THE LUNG!  Seriously, though he is a catch. If he has something in common with Johnny Depp in the movie that features the song "Black Betty", he is a catch and I mean that with utmost sincerity, really I do! Later on we went to "East Side Marios" with Nat, and that was fun. My food was crap, but I filled up on bread so that was ok. I babysat after that, and when the kids were sleeping I watched "Grease" twice. Today was a barrel of laughs. Sarrah, Eva and I went to the park, and talked about everything and nothing! It was so funny! A certain friend of ours who I will name 008 gave us our refreshments for $0.00!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so excited!! That is all to report from this camp. My little critique for today is Frank Sinatra. He is his own person and I can not compare him to anything, he is a legend and I love him. HE IS NATHAN DETROIT!!! I mean geeze louise I love that movie. That movie being "Guys and Dolls." I have to go now though. Hoccha  Author: Eve

      Hello faithful readers of this here blog.I am home from my excersion from SouthHampton, it was so UBER fun. We went boating and seadoing, and such my arms hurt, but ut was so fun! The weather was perfect, and we only had two days of rain, and there was a special type rain storm that light up the sky at midnight. We went to Sauble and got hit on by random guys, we scored a 10 on the honk-a-meter. Last night I went to the movies with Eva and my cousin, and we saw "Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban." The movie was fantastic, and I saw Alexander. HOLY CRAP he is the hottest man in the history of time, including the space time continume. It was also a good night for Eva, because she saw Emo glasses boy. We do not know his real name, but he is&nbsp;is the coolest in the looks department. I am to excited to write more so Hoccha and bye.  Author:Eve

      Start spreading the news, I'm leaving Sunday! I am even more excited about Eva's cottage, know that I know my good buddy Kath mo will be there too! I went to Angels Diner with my aunt and cousins today it was major fun, I then went to Starbucks and got a white Moccah Frapacinno. Scrummy. I heard, thanks to my buddy Eva that David Bowie had to have emergency heart surgery! I was sad, but he is ok,so I am happy. I am wearing my Bowie shirt in his honor today. Eva got red checkered shoes in Toronto, and she seems to like them, so that is a good thing, I am glad of that. I am going shopping with my mommy tonight to get stuff that I need for the cottage. I love mommy! We got me some new undies yesterday, they are pretty. Craig Nichols and his band broke up, that saddens me, I think I will put on some Blur to cheer me up. Country House I think. Last night I was up until like 3 o'clock watching movies. In the past four nights I watched the following movies."Guys and Dolls," "The Country Girl," "Breakfast at Tiffany's," and "Gentelemen Prefer Blondes." They are so good, old school good. I had Old school good though. I had really  nice talks with Taryn, Eva, and Danielle yesterday, it was so fun!! I am going to start work on my novel.Hoccha Author:Eve

      So yesterday I went to Taryns house and it was me and Danielle and Sarrah, and of coarse Taryn and we had a "Cruel Intentions" Marathon!! Then we went and walked to ger ice cream and it started to rain, profusley! We were soaked through! It was fun to the max! Taryn went to Target and bought me shoes. They are pretty like, with sparkle do-hickeys and such. I leave on Sunday for the cottage,I am so excited! Mommy is taking me shopping tonight to bye all the esentials. I am going to hunt for the opposite sex while I am there, I have not had a summer fling, and I would like to say I have had one, that would be fun? The Outsiders is on right now,which is one of my favorite movies in the whole world. My friend Kayla and I were obsessed with it. She was going to marry Matt Dillon (grr!)and I was to marry patrick Swazye. (yay)It was a fun phase, that I am not sure I want to be done with. Anyways, I am off like a dirty shirt, oh Duckie, and if I have used that line before I apoligise! Hoccha! Author:Eve

      Its Tuesday today! I did not end up going to Sauble, so my negativity was much desired, well mabey not desired, but it was definatly not wrong in any way. I have just finished talking to my friend Katherine on a great invention called msn, she has told me of a book, we share the same likeing in reading and the like, so I am excited to read it actually. I leave for Eva's cottage on Sunday! I am so excited. I had a soccer game last night, it was fun I laughed about a million times. It was Emmas birthday I brought her a crown. I love you Emma, my litte chief! I was alsot told that one of my futre husbands will be coming to Toronto.(Yes one of them, I am planning to have in the upwards of 5 mabey 6)This one being Totti, soccer player extrodaneare, and from what I can see a sex pot to the max! i am kidding just a little joke to pass the tiem calm down I say! How big can flies get, there is one beside me the size of a beetle. Oh fun story, that I almost forgot. I went to Kurtis' house for a birthday get together. It was mucho fun. We had a bonfire, I got eaten by mosqui toes  on my  toes  ( ha ha laughs!)I got chocolate all over my clothes! Thanks a lot Josh! We had a good talk on the trampoline! I am hoping we hava another shin dig like that. I have noticed I talk like this is 1940s New York, which it is not. Speaking of that though (look at me all segwaying!) last night I watched "Guys and Dolls" with Marlon and Frank. I love that movie, but Marlon died, so it is my new mission in life to watch all of his movies, before the summer ends, that is alot of movies I know but worth it because Marlon is tres amazing. I must go get dressed now so ta ta mes amis. I will write more later but not now. P.s. Marlon= Marlon Brando and Frank= Frank Sinatra, and if you didn't know that you have some movie/music resarch to do, because they really were quite famous and I am appauled that they would be forgotten due to their emense tallents, but before I go on to and angry rant. Hoccha! Author: Eve.

      Hey people!(Who is this physco perky person that has taken over my blog?) Today is Canada Day! So as usual my family is doing..umm NOTHING! We are soo festive, aren't we darling? Hmm yes! Tomorow is soo much fun! I am to go to Sauble/South Hampton, which with my luck won't happen! lol! Again I am being negitive. NOTE TO SELF: Stop being so negitive!Yesterday was supposed to be so much fun due to the party for Hilary, yeah that didn't work out. I went with Nat Ack. We felt sooo left out! So to make things better, (and whoa Nelly were they ever better!)Jess me and nat went and saw the Notebook. It is with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams SOOO GOOD! It was so sad yet so happy at the same time. I LOVED IT!!! Nat and Jess are good company. We are planning to go and see Harry Potter togther next weekend! It is soo hot today, which is odd, and perplexing at the same time. It has been soo cold for soo long that hot days are forigen to me. I like warm to medium hot days.Which odly enough is the same way I like my steak. Warm being replaced with well.So I like my steak well to medium well. That is so off topic. What is my topic? Oh ya weather!! I don't like that topic. Lets move on. Sarrah is back in town! Hoccha!!!YAY that will make for a FUN SUMMER!!! I am all crampy due to the fact that the painters are in! Eww. I have decided to talk and type in some french and using cool British slang. I am into that at the moment, one day Eva and I spent the whole days using accents. Now I must go. I spent the whole day tanning on my deck, so naturally the sun made me drained and tired so I must veg out (slack off, do nothing) on the couch for the rest of the day. Bye my loverlys. Days to Evas cottage:11! (Yay and Double cool with Knobs!)Hoccha. Author:Eve

      Hello all I am back in town again. I was at Eva's cottage, yes I know again! but here is the thing, I had oddles of fun so I don't care. I had a FACIAL! I know, it was so good, and my skin is nutso! I also bought shoes, like the comfy ones my mommy threw away, and a shirt, and I went kyaking for the first time EVER! I also met a lot of Eva's family, I met her aunt Jane, who was so nice, and I am to go with Eva to her place for labor day weekend. I think it will be fun if it falls into place! A girl can dream! ha ha! Well I have to unpack and do laundry and such so I will write more later, but before I go I will critique Jackalope, a new Canadian band from the BC area, I believe. They are heavily influenced by Trent Resnor on NIN, and I for one think it is obvious, he even played on a few tracks, which is cool. The lead singer has an amazing voice, she is like a Shirly Manson, for the new generation, she really sounds like her actually. But ya out of 5 i give them a 3 and a half. That's good. P.S. I have noticed that I am a horrible speller, so any incorrect spelling of words and such, please overlook that, it would be much apreciated! Hoccha Author:Eve

      HELLO. How are you people out there in computer land? I am snazzy. I got a call from my cousins in Florida a little while ago, and I am Uber jealous. I just wanted to let you know why I changed the name of the blog and all the settings and such. Well I changed the name because I have a wierd obsession with Argile sweaters, and well frankly I wanted my blog to reflect that. I changed the settings to the pink thing, because, I thought it looked like my blog had the measels. Now I don't want to have the measels, so why would I want my blog to have it, that is just mean! So now I will critique. Romones. Gabba Gabba Hey. They are PUNK LEGENDS. That is all I have to say about that. I must be going.Hoccha Author:Eve

      Hello all. I am sort of sorry for the delay in writing, but I have been busy, and I like that feeling! I would recap what I have been up to, but that would boar you to tears, I mean it. I will tell you what I did today, I went and saw Anchorman with Taryn, Krista, and Sarrah. It was hilarious, I mean it was an "Afternoon Delight!" ha ha ha the whit, I mean it ozzes from me. I am again excited a mundo. Here is why, I am going to Eva's cottage again on Wednesday for 3 days, which I am totally looking forward to. I love her cottage! It is so cozy and nice and such. I got my hair cut today, it is all layery with some bangage, but not really you see. I like it so do friends, mommy is not it's biggest fan, but I will get over that. Well I guess the thing is she needs to get over it due to the fact that it is my hair,and not hers. I think I make logic. I saw confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and Dirty Dancing Havana Nights, both very very good. Personally I liked DD2 the best. Two reasons. 1. The dancing is sooo crazy nuts, I am debating weather or not to take ballroom. 2. I know get the obsession my friends have with Diego Luna. He is on my top 5 list fo shiz. Well I am going to go now. Hoccha. Author:Eve
