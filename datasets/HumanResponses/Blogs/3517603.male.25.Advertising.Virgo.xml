      It is utterly amazing how people can lie to one another, or ask others to lie for them with out a second thought.  I mean really the only thing that we do to each other is dilute the victim and give them a false sense of security. The best thing to do is to tell others your true thoughts on the subject at hand, this will help develop better relationships with the few people that you do not offend.  The real problem is that most of us were raised to lie in an effort to spare someone’s feelings, but really you are only creating problems for your self later on in life (thanks mom).    An example would be some of my ex-girlfriends.  Three of my four past girlfriends have plumped becoming larger than my preference.  I was thinking of  a nice way to tell my last mate to lose some weight (keep in mind that I am not as shallow as most, but the shift in weight was abnormal).  A friend told me to “use the English language.” He went on this spiel about how women will better deal their current suitor for someone with a better active profile (income, car, etc.).  He seemed pretty bitter but the essence of the message was clear; tell this person the truth.  This would make everyone’s life easier if  everyone whom received these messages would just accept the fact that those pants make you look fat, or your girlfriend does sort of look like you.  It is not always meant to be an act of cruelty, the honesty is refreshing and may make you a better person in the long run. It might even lower the divorce rate in the US.  Just a thought, but if you think my idea sucks then say so.

      Would the world be a better place if we shot all useless and moronic people?  Would we be happier with a smaller population, more focus on individual achievement, art, and science? Or am I delusional and subconsciously violent toward those whom cannot benefit me, themselves, or others even though they seem to have a normal IQ?

      It is mind boggling how many people spawn duplicates of themselves. And it seems like chances are most of these replicas are not planned or initially wanted.  I will soon jump off of the cruise ship of irresponsibility into the cramped space of real life and parenthood in a few months because my EX-girlfriend says that she is having my child and she wants to keep it.  My view on the Pro-choice issue is irrelevant right now because I really do not have a say in the matter but I am going to be in the child’s life if it is mine.  How did this happen?  Well it is your classic case of “heat of the moment syndrome.”  I can honestly say that I did make an effort to grab a condom but my efforts were forted. I can also not say that this situation is not my fault, but I do wish I would have taken better control of the situation.    I have a to-do list for before and after the child is born, but realizing that that there are different avenues that I can take I am going to take the long hard parenting road that so few “men” choose to take these days.  The only problem with this road is that my EX is not trying to make it any smoother for me.  Her indifference, and lack of emotion cause me to wonder if this child really is mine or if there were some one else in the our picture.    The only thing that I can do is wait and see, and if it not my child that is where my parenting time-line stops. Either way, learning experience.  I do not know if I will be a great father or one that makes a lot of mistakes, but I do know that I will do my best.

      One day  was thinking about the Matrix and wondered what kind of name I would have if I were a hacker or a person that was proficient in computer tools, or just given the gift of insight knowing that my world was not real.  What kind of name would you give your self if you were a pseudo Jesus if you will.  After about five minutes I came up with a remarkable name for the greatest hacker/computer wiz/ pseudo Jesus on the planet.    That name is . . . Tron.  If  Neo's name were Tron I am sure there would be copyright issues involved, and speculation about the history of the name, but really that is the movie that (for me) started it all.  and even though the special effects suck to today's standards it was still a pivotal movie.    Not to be modest but if I were in the Matrix and I had to fight, as Tron I would be unstoppable because who could mess with a guy named Tron? I know Mr. Anderson couldn't.

      All this talk about gay marriage makes me wonder about a weird topic:  If I were gay, would I be the same person?  Would I have the same hobbies, play the same sports, have the same job, or the same friends?  What kind of physical features would I look for in a partner?   If the world were like the “Twilight Zone” and every one whom is “straight” were “gay” and vice versa would the world be the same?  Would there be less war, more art, or discrimination against those “hetero”, vagina loving, breast suckling (my favorite) bastards.  Would Jesus have been gay in this world? Would the disciples have said that sex outside of the desire for procreation would be sinful?  Would gay people try to hide behind the “word of God” to say that people of the opposite sex could not wed? Or would they love everyone as their equal?   Well after about five seconds of thought I have created this world.  I think that the world would be more unified because we would have to work together to keep the species going.  It would be like a big long cat and mouse game though because the “hereto” would be trying to sleep with the “homo” and all the “homo” would just want to be friends with the “hereto”. The “hereto” would put up with this so they would be in a better position to help out the “homo” when child procreation was necessary.  There would be peaceful coexistence until the creation of artificial insemination.  With copious amount of sexual aggression, the lack of respect and suitor candidates the “hetero” would lash out and have as much dirty sex, and procreation as possible before meeting their individual ends.  They would also not have sex with the “homo” in the effort of breeding them out.  This would not work though because the “homo” would either try to have sex with a person of the opposite sex or they would just inseminate artificially.   There would be sexual aggression towards all and finally we would just ignore that part of the “word of God” and we would become a unified global economy.  The world would be at total peace, and we would all be happy because we recreated Eden.  Then one person might say, “Wow, God was wrong” and the world would blow up ending everyone’s existence.  The fact of the matter is that nothing will change nor will anything ever change until humans as a whole decide to make an effort towards displaying more empathy toward other humans.  This would force us all to have an open mind in al facets of life, which would in turn make us all better people.  If the thug could understand the yuppie along with all other subcultures and vice versa we would the stereotypes that have been regurgitated from generation to generation.  I am not saying that we should all be best friends, but we should all try to understand each other to make the world a better place.

      You know with the whole Democratic convention thing going on, I have notice my complete and total lack of interest, but why?  The reason is that the end is more exciting than the beginning. Both candidates are too serious and Americans are stressed out.  The fact that the news reports the same information over and over again does not help matters.  Speaking from personal experience, if I know what you are going to say I won’t pay as much attention the second time around.  I mean really, why would the gatekeepers want us to be informed any way (kidding)?   I think that if we were to go back to basics, like for instance archaic power struggles to decide a leader if there is another close tally would spark more interest in the hearts of Americans.   Don’t get me wrong I would have tuned in to the Democratic convention but the fact that a bunch of rich white males raising their arms and laughing as they try to boost their popularity points for future poles while I look for a second job to pay for my student loans just is not appealing to me.  I can appreciate what they are doing and why, but I feel that Kerry is making some promises that he may not be able to keep which will not help him in the long run.   What the candidates should try doing is making their campaigns entertaining; offer more humor, or something more palatable to the common man (which is the main demographic that will be reached by television).  If Kerry or Edwards did something off the wall not only would it give us something new to hear about, it would spark a new interest, and maybe get more people interested (for instance people watch “Fear Factor” because they wonder what the contestants will have to do next).  There may not be a debacle like last years election but if there were it would be cool to see the two duke it out in a ring or something (it would be pretty interesting to see how each would stack up in a ring don’t you think).  They could have catchy slogans like “pound for pound I am the best choice”, or “Bush’s face and America’s problems have something in common.  They will both get punched out.”   It does not have to be that extreme, but you get the drift.  However after fighting I do not think any one would be so ready to go to war.
