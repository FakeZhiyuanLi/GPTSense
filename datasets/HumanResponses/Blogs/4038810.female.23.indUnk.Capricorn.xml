        At the ripe ole’ age of 23 I am falling apart.&nbsp; I haven’t come to this conclusion lightly mind you; there are many things I can back my statement up with.         1. At the age of 15 I tore my ACL in half playing tennis.&nbsp; I proceeded to play 3 more years of tennis and a year of cheering in college on my knee before deciding to finally have surgery.&nbsp; After the surgery for the next two years my knee hurt worse then it did before I had the surgery.&nbsp; I do have to say that my knee doesn’t give me problems that much anymore, but that is still a very young age to tear your ACL.   2. In the past year I have been to the doctor for my back 3 times.&nbsp; The first time I went I found out that I had a Sciatica nerve problem.&nbsp; I had to go to the doctor several time and take lots of medication then one day it just decided to go away.  3.Back pain doctor visit number two.&nbsp; In June I woke up with the worst pain in my back I have ever felt.&nbsp; I would say I have a pretty decent pain tolerance from all the knee stuff.&nbsp; I can normally tolerate things pretty well, but this pain was so bad it had me in tears.&nbsp; I almost called my mother at 3AM to come and get and take me to the emergency room.&nbsp; I put some ice on it and went back to bed.&nbsp; After work the next day went to the doctor’s office and was given muscle relaxers, anti inflammatory and pain killers.&nbsp; After about a week the pain went away and I forgot all about it.   4.This week on Monday I went to the eye doctor because my eyes have been blood shot all the time and my right eye decided to go blurry on me Sunday.&nbsp; After that nice visit I was told I have an eye infection and am on some sort of eye drops to clear that up and am not allowed to wear my contacts.   5.On to back problem number 3.&nbsp; On Tuesday night I woke up with the same pain in my back again.&nbsp; I went to work and couldn’t make it, so I went to the doctor who told me the same thing he had told me a month and a half ago.&nbsp; At this point I’m feeling like it is kind of weird that a 23 year old is having all these back problems but I went home and lay on the couch waiting for the pain to stop.&nbsp; At 9PM the pain still hadn’t stop.&nbsp; You would think when you are 4 prescriptions that it should have eased up a little.&nbsp; My mom and dad came and got my around 9:30 and I spent about 2 hours in the emergency room.&nbsp; After some test and about 5 x-rays the conclusion was reached that I had thoracic back strain.&nbsp; Sounds like a pretty fancy ailment.&nbsp; I was giving another pain killer because he thought the other one I was on was too week.   6.This isn’t really a reason that I think I’m falling apart, but it adds wonderfully to my week of eye and back problems.&nbsp; First of all I must say that I have never gotten sick from medicine before so if this was from that, or a small bug I guess I will never know.&nbsp; I took the meds this morning as directed and went to work.&nbsp; I even ate a little breakfast like it recommends. Well I started to feel sick at work.&nbsp; I am going to spare you of the details, but the meds or the food didn’t agree with me.&nbsp; Even when I come home for lunch I was still feeling very nauseous.&nbsp; I somehow drove myself back (I have to add that I am still very dizzy at this time) and stayed at work for about 30 minutes.&nbsp; When I decided for the second day in a row that I wasn’t going to make it.&nbsp; I came home and lay on the couch again for a while and then proceeded to get sick again.&nbsp; It is now 7:40 and I am just now feeling like I can eat some crackers and sprite.   Maybe I haven’t had the worse life when it comes to ailments, but at this point I do feel like I’m falling apart.&nbsp; I am scared to know what 30 is going to be like…

      Well since I am not at work this afternoon I thought I should make a post.&nbsp; I hate sitting at home being bored, specially when I am in pain and can't go anywhere to kill some time.&nbsp; Daytime TV shows are nonexistent when you don't have cable.&nbsp; The only thing I have seen worth wild, well at least entertaining, was the Ellen show.&nbsp; She cracks me up!&nbsp; Now the only thing I can find are soap operas and talk shows.&nbsp; Now I mean no offense to people who watch soap operas, but I think they are some of the worst actors I have ever seen.&nbsp; Maybe I don't have the best opinion of them because I have only watched maybe 15 minutes in my whole life, but sometimes I think I could do a WHOLE lot better then them.&nbsp; Then there is the plot.&nbsp; Could it be anymore obvious what is going to happen.&nbsp; You don't even have to watch the show ... Just turn it on&nbsp; and you can figure it out in about 2 minutes.&nbsp; OK ... Maybe this is some of the meds I am on right now talking (which I might add are not working), but I just wanted to vent out TV shows ... or the lack of them.&nbsp; Ok well I'm getting sleepy now ... so it's nap time.

       Well I just made fun of a coworker about 10 minutes ago for his blog … well look what I got talked into.&nbsp; I really don’t think I’m ever going to have anything interesting to say on here that is going to be worth reading, but I guess I can have fun with it.&nbsp; The only thing exciting I can think of right now is that LANCE WON THE TOUR DE FRANCE!!!!!&nbsp; I am going to get made fun of for saying that, but I don’t care.&nbsp; Well, enough wasted time at work … back to more important things.    &nbsp;

       Athens Greece, 2004… The Olympics. Every four years the best athletes across the world arrive at one place with a chance to prove their greatness, whether it is swimming, gymnastic, tennis, rowing, cycling, etc. Many have waited and dreamed about this day their whole lives. For the majority of their lives they have trained every waking moment of the day for the chance to experience this. They have sacrificed other things in their life’s that most of us would never dream of doing. They now have the chance to live that dream out and with any luck bring home the coveted gold medal.  After reading some articles this morning I wonder what it would feel like to set a world record in an event, win a medal (of any color), or just be a participant. These things are something I will never know. I never had the discipline or the motivation that all these athletes have. It’s almost a jealous feeling, what am I good at? I mean yeah, I have things that I am good at, but nothing worthy of anything these athletes do. I would love to know the feeling of being the best at something, knowing that I beat out the best in the world and get to hear the USA National anthem played for me in a foreign country. I’m sure it is a very miraculous moment, knowing that all the pain and hard work you went threw was all worth it. However, it’s something this average girl will never know.

      For those of you who do not know … I am a HUGE  Sister Hazel  fan.  The new CD “ Lift ” comes out one week from today.  I have heard clips from the CD and it sounds like a REALLY good one.  I would put the lyrics to my favorite songs from the old albums on here, but Jeremy would then make fun of me by posting more weird lyrics to his blog.  Drew Copeland (one of the members of the band) is also coming out with his CD “ No Regrets ” that day too.  I have not decided whether I will purchase that CD also (you know me and actually spending money on music … it is a big step for me to actually go and buy a CD).  I might splurge and get that too, but I have been spending a lot of money lately, so I better not.  Who knows though.  Back to the Rig phone list here @ work now … Hope everyone is having a GREAT day :-)

       Ok so I just read some other guys blog about him getting his   urlLink  Lance Armstrong    bracelet in the mail and I thought I should post my thoughts on this. I have been wearing my bracelet everyday for the past couple of weeks. I'm sure most of you know by now that I'm a pretty big fan of his (I had his pic on my blog after he won the   urlLink  Tour de France   ). I was extremely happy when Emily from work gave me mine ... it goes to really great cause and I was more the happy to show my support for the foundation and for Lance, but little did I know that guys liked to use this as a tool to pick me up in bars. One of the situations was not in a bar but I will start out with it. I was driving down the road the other day when I looked to the car next to me and some guy was practically half way out the window trying to get my attention to show me that he had the bracelet on too ... now at this point I thought it was pretty cool that people noticed and knew what it was for. Ok, situation number 2 ... I went to a place that I will not name because I hate it sooo much. The only reason why I went that night was to hang out with some friends that I hadn't hung out with in a while. While I was watching people make a fool of themselves on the dance floor some dorky guy came up to me asking if that was a Lance bracelet I had on. Well naive me plays along, says yes, and acts interested in what he had to say for a minute.... then the guy kept talking and talking and talking. I don't care where you are from or if you ride bikes dude ... this is not a way to pick up girls. Ok now on to number 3 ... I was at Redrock the other night (this is one of my favorite places to go I might add), I'm sitting on a bench minding my own business sending a text message while my friend is talking to who knows who ... and the guy sitting next to me must feel like this is a way to pick up girls also and tries to start out the conversation again with..... "Oh, is that a Lance Armstrong bracelet?" Now this guy was better then the first I might add and actually had something a little more interesting to say (not that he ever had a chance starting the conversation out like that) but still, is that all you can come up with???? I will keep wearing my bracelet because I want to show my support, but come on guys ...

      Well it should come as no surprise to me at this point to have my back start hurting again. The pain was bearable this time ... Nothing compared to the last time it happened. I spent Saturday night at home this weekend because I took all the meds that I had from last time, and those things will knock you out. I was sleeping by around 10:30 or 11:00. I woke up pretty early on Sunday and was planning on going to church, but thought that it would be better to stay at home and ice my back. I didn't get out of my PJs all day long, and didn't even make my bed (that only happens maybe 3 or 4 times in a year). I felt like a bum all day long. Whatever I did seemed to have worked a little though because the back is a little sore but a lot better then it did feel. Work time now though ... Just have to get some caffeine because the medicine is making me sleepy.

       Lately I have been on this “I want to see the world” kick. That is all I have been thinking about the past few days. The list that I have keeps growing in my mind. Here is what I have so far … I might mention that this is a long and growing list.  London, England Several places in Italy Greece (mainly Athens) Australia Hong Kong New Zealand Paris, France Scotland Germany Egypt Spain The 7 wonders of the world  I’ll have to add to that later. However you are talking about a girl that doesn’t even have a passport. The only place I have been out of the country was when I was 15 and went on a Mexico Missions trip. In Adria’s fairy tale world that I have talked about before, I would like to take a month or two off work and go and see all of these places. Financially speaking I probably could go see many of them. For the most part I am a very frugal person (that is what Jessica likes to call me when I say I’m cheap). I am the girl who didn’t have to work in college and had three jobs. I started putting money regularly into my saving at the age of 16. For some reason I thought I needed to start saving for retirement or something. One of my problems is, even though right now when I don’t have a house payment, or car payment, or any of those worries that I will be having very soon … I am a 23 year old girl whose friends right now would rather go lay on a beach in Mexico for a vacation then going to see all sites of the world (not that I wouldn’t have fun doing that, but I just want to do something bigger). Going to these places alone probably isn’t that safest thing in the world … nor would it be that fun to see all of those wonderful things and have no one to share the experiences with.  I do all this talking, and at the moment all this research, on different places and I will probably never even get to see them. I am very good at talking myself out of things. In my mind I would probably tell myself that I should save for a nice down payment on a house or a car. I do have all these goals set for myself and spending thousands of dollars on trips seems out of the question. I want to by a house by the age of 25, buy a new car sometime soon, finish my MBA by 25 or 26 (I was accepted to start in August this year but am deferring my admission for a semester or year). When does seeing the world fit into that, and what is more important to me. I should probably not be so materialist about things sometimes and just go. We will see where this goes though.

       Ok so it’s really early in the morning on Friday. I went out last night for a while and I’m pretty sure that you are supposed to be late to work on the next morning, not extremely early. I seriously have some issues … I could have slept for a good 20 more minutes. I wouldn’t say I have a hang over this morning, but I need to get some food in my tummy here in the next little bit. I didn’t eat dinner last night and I feeling a little run down at the moment. Hopefully the food will help. I can’t really remember the last time I went out on a week night … I probably wont do that again for a while. I’m going to be a sleepy girl all day long … I took a no doz this morning if that tells you anything. Ok well I think I have a ton to do so I better get to work.  Oh, I have decided to try and NOT over analyze things anymore :-) … Hopefully that will make my life easier.

       I would say that I have always, for as long as I can remember, been a very realistic and rational person. I’m never one to do something really crazy or outrageous. I am an over analyzer to the point that I drive myself insane with it sometimes. I have never been one to really care what most people thought about my decisions in life or how I dealt with things. As long as it was what I wanted or thought was right for me I went with it. However, I find myself wondering what people are thinking lately … friends in particular (not going to name any names here for fear of them reading this). I am contemplating doing something (again not going to say what, but it’s nothing that big for those of you who I’m sure had some weird thoughts going through your head) that isn’t really something I would normally do. It’s not something very realistic in the large scale of things, but could be a blast. In the back of my mind I keep hearing one of my friends over and over in my head saying that it isn’t very rational. Why is this bothering me? Why do I care? For once in my life maybe I want to do something that is crazy, or irrational. I doubt it’s going to kill me. Could this friend’s comment I have in the back of my mind really be me saying you are dumb for even considering this? No one really has to answer that question, just something I’m thinking.  Ok I better stop with this right here … haha. I’m sure you all think I’m really weird and strange right now, but most of you already knew this about me.

       Found this song tonight (well haven't heard the whole thing becuase it's not released yet) and I really liked the lyrics. Thought i would post it.    Ryan Cabrera     Take It All Away   So much beauty in life Shining on the outside Empty on the inside I get lost sometimes Blinded by the flashing lights Distractions always in my eyes  So i'm following the sound, the sound of my heart Beating  [chorus] You can take it all away I don't need it Underneath, i'll still be the same You can take it all away I don't need it, it's not me You can take it all, take it all away I'll still be the same  Are you hiding still? Don't you want to love yourself? Don't you know that someone will? Time can turn it around Leave it all that's dribbled down That's the only way to find it out  Are you following the sound, the sound of your heart? Beating  [chorus]  Coming in with nothing, leaving with the same It's all inside Coming in with nothing, the only thing that saves Is here inside  [chorus]

       Now I have to start this out by saying that I always have loved thunder and lightening. When I lived in DC I was extremely surprised how much I missed seeing and hearing it while it was raining. However, last night I thought I was going to be struck by the lightening laying in bed. Around 3 AM in the morning I seriously think I jumped out of bed it scared me so bad. Now this wasn’t some little dinky thunder. We are talking I think it was right out my window for a good 30 minutes. Now I might not be gripping about this if I was still able to be lying in bed at home at the moment, but I’m not. I am at work on a morning that looks like it should be about midnight outside. These are the kind of mornings that you wish all businesses would close for a few hours so everyone can lay bed and listen to the rain outside. We don’t all live in Adria’s fairy tale world though so I will just go on dreaming about that.

       I have a million things going through my head right now. So much so that I just sat down and wrote in my journal tonight for the first time in a while. It's very therapeutic sometimes, to get all those thoughts floating around down on paper. I would tell you some of those things, but then some of you that still think I'm somewhat normal would realize that I am no where near that. So I will save what normalness (is that a word???) I have with some of you. I will however tell you a funny story, well not so funny to me I guess ... But maybe to you. Went running tonight like I normally do and I was running in the grass on part of my run because I feel it is a little softer on my joints if I do. I wasn't thinking to much about the rain the other morning ... and I'm sure you see where this is going. I ran right through a huge mud puddle. My shoes and legs were covered. But what do you do at that point ... I had to laugh it off and just keep on running. No sense in getting mad about it :-) ...

There is a reason why I don't go there ... and I was reminded of it last night. But it was good to hang out with Jess and Russ. It's been a while since we have all gone out. Time to finish getting ready for church. We are all going together this morning. I will try and get a pic of all of us dressed up :-)

       What is the deal around here lately? Maybe it's the age I'm at, but it seems that EVERYONE I know is getting married. Let’s see if I can name all the weddings I have. There were three in June and one in July (that I chose not to attend), two in August on the same day that I can't attend because I have to be at a shower for a girls wedding I am in in October, there are two in October, one in December, and one in April (that I am the maid of honor in). I have another friend that called me about a week ago to inform me of his engagement. However that wedding is still pending for a date (i believe it will be summer next year). Now don’t' get me wrong, I am happy for all of these people. I am glad they have found their better half. However, what is the hurry people???? I am in NO way wanting to be married any time soon. There are too many things in life I want to be able to do before I am tied down. I want to travel more, maybe move to a new city, I don't know ... what ever I want to do with out consulting someone right now. I guess I might be talking about this differently if I was in love, but I'm not so I can say this. I guess me not wanting to be married right now has a lot to do with me being very independent. I'm not one of those girls who freaks out when they don't have a boyfriend for a month. I welcome the time to myself (that comes from being an only child I'm sure). I would like to find that special someone some day, but I feel like some people settle before they see what is really out there and what it is they really want. They are too afraid that if they let this one go even though there are some things about them they don't like, that they will never be able to find another one. Hopefully this is not true with all the people getting married that I know, but this is just an overall observation by Adria. I know everyone REALLY wanted to hear my opinion on this subject. I guess it was just on my mind since I had to go and try and bridesmaid dresses this morning (and I must say that I actually really like the one that Amanda picked out { urlLink Click here for the link to see it }, I can probably wear it to another wedding since I have like a million to go to). Hope everyone is having a wonderful weekend. I am going to go and take a nap now before I go and have dinner with the newly engaged couple.

      This morning I was listening to a CD and the song Garth Brooks  The Dance  came on. I started listening to the lryics and then looked them up so I could read them. I'm not sure what is coming over me this morning, but for some reason I really liked them. I have listened to the song a million times and am I huge lyrics person to begin with so I'm not sure what about the song got me, but the lyrics are so true. We all have had relationships in the past that didn't go quite as planned, but would we really go back and change the outcome if we could? We become who we are through the experineces we have, so if the outcome had been different would we be a different person because of it? Something to ponder for the day ...    The Dance  - Garth Brooks  Looking back on the memory of  The dance we shared 'neath the stars alone  For a moment all the world was right  How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye   And now I'm glad I didn't know  The way it all would end the way it all would go  Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  But I'd of had to miss the dance   Holding you I held everything  For a moment wasn't I a king  But if I'd only known how the king would fall  Hey who's to say you know I might have chanced it all   And now I'm glad I didn't know  The way it all would end the way it all would go  Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  But I'd of had to miss the dance   Yes my life is better left to chance  I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance

       Well, so far it has been a pretty normal and not exciting week so there really isn't much to write about. Work went by really fast today for some reason ... but all I did this afternoon was play with cameras basically. It's   REALLY freaking hot outside right now and it is kind of messing with my running schedule. You can't run to far when the heat index is getting close to 110 degrees. I love summer and all, but it needs to be a tad cooler in the evenings. I going to have to wait till around 7 or 8 to run tonight. :-P I'm sure you can tell that I have nothing to say since I'm griping about the temperature outside. I just wanted to add something for the day. Well, as one of my friends likes to say ... Peace Out!  Oh ... read this if you want a good laugh  urlLink George's Blog

      Well, its’ been a few days since I have added a blog.  I had a good weekend! :-)  However, just like most weekends go, it was much to short.  I was sad to see it end.  Nothing exciting has been going on this week so far, but it is only Tuesday morning.  Oh, I did have to go back to the eye doctor yesterday … $250 later I was on my way home.  That is ridiculous.  I know that it is my eye sight, and as my mother says … it’s extremely important, but I just think that is outrageous.  Oh well, I will quit my complaining about it.  It’s not the end of the world, but I could think of much better things I would rather spend $250 on, like new fall clothes (which I will be spending some money on this weekend if I can get my friends and family discount @ the Gap … I have to cross my fingers on that one though) or going somewhere fun with some friends.  I guess I should just be happy for being alive :-)!
