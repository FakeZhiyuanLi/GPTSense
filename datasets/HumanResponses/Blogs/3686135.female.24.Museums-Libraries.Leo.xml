      Okay, since I avoid my computer and the Internet when I'm not at work, you, dear reader, are at the mercy of my work schedule :^)  (Of course, I am assuming that there are readers out there...somewhere...reading this...)  Anyway...back to my weekend  I did turn on my computer this weekend...to play  The Sims  and try to back up all my data (almost 20 gigs) to an external hard drive.  The Sims was fun...but the back up thing...yeah, that didn't go so well.  I'm still working on that...I don't have a Firewire or USB 2.0 connection in my computer (GASP!) which sucks...especially when trying to transfer 20 gigs of info from one hard drive to another.  There is a reason to back up all my info...besides the fact that it's a good idea in general.  I am hoping to install 512MB of RAM...without crashing it.  See, The Sims is fun and all, but 256MB of RAM just isn't quite cutting it now.  Plus I have a memory leak (in the computer....well, maybe in my brain too)....hopefully the b/f can fix the backup issues and install the RAM before I get home from work....if not, it will be a long night in front of the computer...not playing Sims.  Okay...half an hour til lunch...and I'm starving!  Back to work for a short while...  Until next time...

      Okay, so yesterday at work was a day of  "meeting hell"  - 3 1/2 hours of it, to be exact!  I was in an interview for an hour, a departmental staff meeting for another hour and a half, then a full staff meeting (second shift) for another hour!  No wonder I had a headache when I went to dinner!  Especially since we didn't seem to get much done.  Only two things were discussed in the departmental meeting...they were important things, but still...I had a longer list than that!  But enough of the ranting about work...  The b/f is looking for an apartment.  We have looked at like 9 different complexes and he looked at another 6 or so on his own.  We have floorplans and prices coming out our ears.  Of course, by the time you've looked at two or three sample apartments they all look the same anyway.  He's narrowed it down to two or three.  The one he'll probably end up with is the one that he likes the least - the office staff, at least.  He said they seemed like they didn't really want him moving in...that they didn't even try to sell the apartment.  I told him that could be because they knew that he knew someone who lived there already and the office staff assumed it would sell itself because of that. (I'm not sure that sentence really makes sense...)  Okay...enough ranting and venting and typing too fast... Back to work!  Until next time...

      Sorry about the longish delay in posts...I got busy actually working at work :^)  Okay, so obviously I work in a library.  Libraries are quite places, right?  Only when the cell phones don't ring!  Why can't people be considerate of others and keep their cell phones on vibrate - or just turn the dumb thing off!!!  Are we all so important now that we must be reachable anytime, anywhere?  I understand that some people have to be reachable at all times - doctors, moms w/small children, etc.  But the rest of us must have a pretty high idea of ourselves if we think we must be reachable at all times.  Does anyone else ever have the desire to be unreachable at times?  I do.  I get emails all day long at work...and of course they're all work related....but I get tired of them.  I get tired of being interrupted in whatever I'm working on by the stupid pop-up window that tells me I have mail.  But since we are in a new, bigger building, you can't just walk over to someone and tell them whatever it is.  And since no one is in their office most of the time, you can't call them either.    Back to cell phones for a minute...I have been in movie theaters where a person behind me was on the phone arguing with someone (loudly) until after the previews started.  I've had them ring in church, too.  Just because we are always reachable is not always good.  Stress levels can rise as more and more people take less time away from work - even when they are away from work.   Americans work more than any other county in the world.   Americans take less vacation time than most other countries in the world.  Americans give that money for paid vacation days back to their employers!   Just think - by not taking your vacation days, you are PAYING YOUR EMPLOYER!   Enough ranting for now...  Until next time!

      Okay, so I'm back at work for Day 2 of 7.  But today my eyes are burning from the combination of being up way too late and staring at a computer screen for too long.  I was up too late because I gave myself a panic attack at like midnight last night.  Sucks...but panic attacks are like  Pringles  - once you pop you can't stop.    See... what happened was that there was this big dog barking outside my apartment.  Dogs never bark outside my apartment.  Well, this makes me wonder what's going on outside my apartment...which leads to "How could someone get into my apartment?"  Which is not a good thing to think about when you are trying to fall asleep by yourself in your apartment.  So I freaked myself out by talking myself into thinking that someone could come in through the bedroom window.  This is not good...so I called the b/f, who had just left, and he came back and got me and I stayed at his parents' house last night.  Which meant he had to bring me back to my apartment this morning...which is a 45 minute drive (one way).  So now I owe him bigtime :^)  And I am even more glad I have him, too...he's wonderful!  It's almost time to go shut off the 40-odd computers here at work, so I better go get started...  Until next time...

      I like ellipses marks.  That's these thingies: ...  I like them a lot.  If they get on  your nerves, sorry...that's just the way I type when I'm online.  Emails, blogs, whatever...all dotted with ellipses marks.  :^)  I never thought about how much I use them until shortly after the first time I emailed my boyfriend.  He mentioned how many I seemed to use.  Now that I'm aware of it, I try not to use them so much.  But that just feels unnatural, so I use as many as I want.  Maybe I should read  Eats, Shoots, & Leaves  and find out if I am using them correctly... or maybe I'm not that bored with them yet :^)  Anyway...so I'm at work and I better do do something useful...like figure out what's in all these file folders on my desk.  I've only been here since January and I have like a dozen file folders in my desk.  I went through them yesterday and discovered there were like three that I had no idea what the stuff in them was.  It's amazing how rapidly stuff accumulates.  I thought you weren't supposed to notice that kind of thing unless you moved (which I seem to do entirely too often), but I guess being a neat freak and an organizational freak you notice a little more.  Okay...no more distractions, really...I'm going back to work this time...  Until next time!

      Time for the weekly update!  I almost forgot, but I didn't, so here it is!  This week's topics on the brain aren't so much related to work as they are to the strange dreams I've been having lately.  Lots of bugs and other weird themes.  Fortunately, there are lots of interesting sites that will "interpret" my dreams for me...I've had weird dreams in the past and they have been my subconscious dealing with issues.  I just can't really figure out what the issue is this time...Maybe I should discuss this with the b/f instead of my blog :^)  Until next time...

      Okay, so it's looking like this is going to be a once a week blog.  Maybe...unless I decide otherwise (isn't that a nice, definite statement) :^)  So updates would be good, right?  Let's see...the fireworks for the Fourth of July were awesome!! I swear my jaw was hurting from smiling so much while I was watching.  They were sooo cool.  &quot; Nashville&#39;s Fourth of July celebration at Riverfront Park is ranked eighth on the American Pyrotechnics Association&#39;s (APA) &quot;Amazing Fireworks Displays Across the Country Honoring our Great Nation.&quot;   ... The APA, considered the leading fireworks industry trade association, describes Nashville&#39;s celebration as &quot;a spectacular concert and fireworks display at Riverfront Park. The Nashville Symphony Orchestra will provide the musical backdrop for the fireworks by Pyro Shows, Inc. With a boosted budget, it will be the biggest show ever (and it&#39;s always huge).&quot;  That's from the  Nashville City Paper , July 1, 2004.  I would definitely agree with the APA.  My  church  had a picnic on the Fourth too, which was fun.  The b/f and I got to help little kids blow bubbles, walwaysis alway fun...returning to childhood...  Let's see...what else is going on in my small corner of the world...work has been extremely quiet lately.  Just kids wanting the shortest summer reading books possible, of course, and patrons using the Internet for various and sundry reasons...of course.  Our printer died, but we were able to get a new part for it, so we were only without for like a week.  Which is good...people like to print...a lot.    Computer classes are rapidly approaching...unfortunately....I have no content planned for the classes and no idea when I will have an idea :^)  I work well under pressure, apparently...  Well, back to work for the last hour and a half...  Until next time...

      Wow...I just realized it's Thursday already!  Where does time go?  So, it's rainy and gloomy here today and I got almost completely soaked going to lunch today - ugh!  Water was running THROUGH my shoes when I went across the parking lot.  Hopefully there will be no flooding, but I doubt it.  It's rained too much here lately for that.    We discovered today that the HP LaserJet 4200n does not do well as a very high-volume printer...ours crashed.  Two weeks after the warranty expired.  Of course.  The fuser is dead.  No printing til the budget is passed which won't be for another couple weeks.  We have to wait for the budget to be passed so we know how much money we have and we can start buying stuff again.  Really annoying, this governmental policy stuff.    I've been trying to make appointments with the chiropractor and the hairdresser, but since it's a holiday weekend and I work 5 or more days a week, it's close to impossible to get an appointment anywhere.  Sometimes I really wish I had a 9-5, Mon-Fri job.  I don't want to have to take time off of work just to go to the doctor.  I'm going to try to get a new mattress and see if that will get rid of some of this stupid neck and back pain...my mattress is very hard...no give at all.    Until next time...
