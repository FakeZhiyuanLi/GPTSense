      wystan hugh auden    funeral blues  stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, silence the pianos and with muffled drum bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.  let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead scribbling on the sky the message he is dead, put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.  he was my north, my south, my east and west, my working week and my sunday rest, my noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; i thought that love would last for ever; i was wrong.  the stars are not wanted now: put out every one; pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood, for nothing now can ever come to any good.

      I argued a bit with my mommy about going to the concerts, cause I actually thought she wouldn't have a problem with me going there, although it is school. she has never had anything against it, she knows I'm a responsible and ambitious girl and very good in school (no, I'm not arrogant, but what do I gain from telling 'well, I'm not bad in school' instead of telling the complete truth? I'd never say that straight in someone's face, though .. [do you notice my need to justify myself? is that a weakness or not?]) - but as I today started with the eleventh grade which really brings with it a higher level, cause it belongs to the school-leaving examination grades, she didn't agree with three days off just for fun [which it would be, oh sweet momma - damn it!]. well, I can understand her arguments, especially since I've been in lisbon for a week and it was school time - but I fought. and it seems I fought it good. because, children: she allows me to go there to witness the second show and to stay over the weekend!! and that means two days holiday - which make apparently a significant difference to three days off. in her opinion. well, fist I was banging in my head and raging about this compromise - why should I go to one concert if the evening right before, I could go to another one? in german there is a proverb, I don't know if it exists in a similar form in english: 'it's better to have the sparrow in the hand instead of watching the pigeon on the roof.' honestly - I'm still hoping that they announce another show on friday ..  anyway, I ordered a ticket a while ago.    Event: Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Venue: Carling Academy Brixton 211 Stockwell Road Brixton London, 0 SW99SL  Seating: STALLS STANDING Time: Thursday, November 11 at 7:00 PM Quantity: 1 Delivery: By Post    including postage, it was 29,50 £. checking the letterbox gets thrilling the next days, a lovely feeling.    urlLink     photo by  urlLink polly borland    oh children, did I tell you that I love that man!?

      just checked ryanair again. I'm a bit confused because it is getting cheaper from day to day. if I wasn't that affectable, I wouldn't value this as a heavenly sign.   and as I, today, had the opportunity to listen to most of the new tracks and still am too dumb of pleasure that I could describe the feeling in the moment, I'm really tempted to book the flights now.

      talking about new releases -  as I mentioned below, [uh, leave these repetitions out!] and they're coming on tour as well! I saw him three times in my live, first time in may 2003 and than two times in lisbon (what a city!) this february. and I already got my ticket for the show in my fucking hometown! yeah! can I ask for more?  oh yes, I can.  first thing is "why am I not born some years earlier?? why do I have to discover nick cave when a big part of his catalogue is history yet? why will I never have the opportunity to witness a birthday party gig? why?" [well, my friend is beatles fan, why do I complain?]  the second thing needs some more explanation [the following paragraph is a quote from an e-mail I recently wrote to someone, just in case this person wants to be credited .. with 'someone']: two weeks ago I came back from london where I stayed for four weeks and which I fell completely in love with. I mean, new york and paris for example were great as well, but london felt like home somehow. it was like, although it sounds pathetic: here I belong. it was like breathing the freshest air ever - though it was certainly not. and - I went there on my own - I didn't even miss my people, my family; and I love them. pretty alarming .. well, and now, I'm a bit miserable and got this yearning in my little gloomy heart. no, it’s more in my throat actually. really, it's nagging. and probably you can guess what would make a good cause for me to return. in November. After going to lisbon this year, I actually wanted to resist, but now, I'm seriously considering to go to the nick cave london shows as well, just that I'd have to save up for it a little, and the first show is already sold out! but due to the web and certain black market fellows this shouldn't be the big problem if I decided to go.  so, the second thing is: I want to go to london!! but I need a donor. and as I do not know if my father will keep up transferring money after a really big quarrel about basic questions of education and moral standards he had with my mum recently, I should contemplate working.  that sounds stupid now - it's not only for these concerts (which I guess I won't go to anyway), no, generally. I really like to have more money.  but coming back to my thirst for dirty thames water; I already checked the flight prices, when I'd go with ryanair, it would only cost me 40,00 euro. but the accomodation is really expensive in london. but sleeping with six other woman in some 'inn' in camden would be affordable. now that would be fun!  ok, tomorrow I'll think about that again.

       urlLink     urlLink nice!  the new marianne faithfull album 'before the poison' is available for ... uhm, let's call it pre-listening on this site - many thanks to the giver! I'm definitely going to buy it anyway [just to let you know], although it may be a matter of time because this autumn is full of new desirable releases.   there's just a report on tv - disturbances in nadjaf. mad world.

        it's not about worth let's not talk about things we know are just there to keep us from admitting our actual needs your facial expression is about the things you try to hide not about those you want to emphasize and I notice that, dear because it's the same with me and it's not 'bout faith or belief or trust not even honesty but there are things beyond our comfort that we have to investigate to be finally able to break this break it like a match or break it like we've broken our bones this rose is danglin from your teeth with the thorns in your lips and I catch the blood  we have to break this like a match    &#169 neef

      it's actually still yesterday. well, technically, it's today, but why can't I accept that a new day breaks with the clock closing its legs over its center [uuuuuh!]? anyway .. I think the problem is that I can't sleep when having holiday. I'm probably missing the tiring boredom. although right now I'm bored as well, but it's a really nice kind of boredom, cause I can be bored officially. and call it relaxing. really, I enjoy myself enormously when I just sit here. on my computer. or lying in my bed and just reading, taking a nap all five chapters - can I ask for more? well, now me, I sound like a bore. and the world is full of crashing bores, as you may remember if you are the quarry.  the bad thing about this nice kind of boredom is that I'm too lazy to do something creative. which turns the whole issue around, because that's not good. I recently decided to take writing seriously. because - oh damn, now I write it down, but that's part of the therapy - I want to make music. but that's not quite right, 'make music' .. I don't know what's my big problem with admitting the desire. maybe it's because I'm still not sure to have figured out if that's really something I want to do or rather a kind of silly illusion which will bring me a bit closer to the admired thing itself: music, music which I consider great. now, as we're alone here - the admired musicians. the thing is, the urge is not so overwhelming that I'd feel like dying if not giving in. but I feel that I may be able to achieve something and as a result to give my mind a sense. that sounds stupid, but it's as sincere as I can express it. there are aspects in my mind that I hardly release or - even more often - disguise in 'no, I'm just kidding'. however, with writing this I'm writing a statement which will encourage me to hang on this thought. one step, I guess. and with writing this, I've probably answered the question. now I have to buy a multitracker. I'm currently watching some auctions on ebay. I'll keep informing my humble readers about possible results. and now have a look at this poem (or song, I already have the melody, sounds right on my piano) below. 'the lighthouse song' .. nice.

       urlLink     introducing another candidate for 'I love that person' screams coming out of my mouth: ladies and gentlemen, may I present you  mrs. carina round  -  today I was listening to her album 'the first blood mystery' (I seriously advise you to give it a listen!). and when it came to 'let it fall', I just had to cry. it's a song about her father. and it's just breathtaking. because the lyrics are great, because the music is great and because I can draw some parallels to my relation with my  papa .    Let It Fall          So you say we have no future As father and daughter I wish you could see me in your skin, And the hole you left within  But you never stop to see what you begun Oh lord, look what you've done The consequences of your slick Italian style Rumbling beneath the home truth  And all the seas here will carry a breeze of A scent I do not know The breath of my father My sister of another Bathing the wounds  So you say we have no future, What with no past either But you were never stuck for your excuses Just say you remember, Don't let it slip from your mind Blood is all around  Would you say my name the way it's meant to be said Let it fall from your mouth To see a flicker in my father's eye, To feel his breath upon my brow  And all the seas here wil carry a breeze of A scent I do not know The breath of my father, My sister of another, Bathing the wounds  Julia, you're here in my fingers You seem to flip between my skies Sharing the dream of, of a life I will never know I will never know  And all the seas here will carry a breeze of A scent I do not know The breath of my father, My sister of another, Bathing the wounds  Would you say my name the way it's meant to be said Let it fall from your mouth, Let it fall from your hands, Let it slip from your hips, Let it slip from your skin, Let it skin from your mind I am knee deep in your blood and you are knee deep in mine Say my name the way it's meant to be said Let it fall from your mouth, I am knee deep in your blood and you are knee deep in mine        © carina round  brilliant, huh? and I found a version of this song for download:  urlLink Carina Round performing 'Let It Fall' live - 2004-05-08 San Diego, Epicentre   thanks to  urlLink www.carinalive.com !

      my humble readers,  as you can easily see, this is my first post. I plan to keep up writing in english which there are several reasons for that will explain theirselves in the coming months. since I know myself, I'm sure I'll write about this fact of writing in english quite often. I'm always thankful when kind souls correct my spelling or grammer in a polite way. but admittedly, I am a self-centered person - the only word I'm writing with capital letter is, as you may have noticed, the pronoun of the first person singular. now I'm curious about what will happen with this little site.  [another thing to add: I'm not going to sign my posts with the name that is not mine anyway.]
