      IP subnetting is fun (did i ever mention i'm a geek?). Its kindof like math, but then actually interesting. How many C-class subnets do I need for 2200 total network hosts with no more than 275 hosts on any one subnet. one subnet as you all know can only hold 256 hosts (including gateway etc) so you're going to have to supernet. You tie 2 c-class subnets together with a wider mask such as 255.255.254.0 Now you have 2 c-class subnets in one superclass. so for 2200 hosts on 8 subnets you need 16 C-class subnets.  This is what i'm doing on a sunday moring...  *ahem*

      Just finished watching the  urlLink Return of the King . Peter Jackson kicks ass with his LOTR films.  Still though i think that my favorite of them all is  urlLink the Fellowship . It seems to me that there is more "hidden" things that you can pick up on when watching it over and over again.  So now i'm watching  urlLink MXC . i have to say that i'm impressed by the makes of the show with their translations as it is almost what they are actiually saying... it matches with what they are doing but then i  hope  that it's not actually what they are sayingin the  urlLink japanese version . It's amazing what they'll go though without being completely plastered :-)

      nothing interesting is going on. I have nothing to report on. Other than maybe that the drive from State College to Lewistown still sucks. The construction on seven mountains is horrible because the nice semi drivers pull out right in front of you and then proceed to drive down the mountain at 20 miles per hour.   Always great fun!

      So yeah, i started this logging thing again.  Once upon a time, i decided to do this blogging thing. I installed Greymatter on my website and I called it moobl. within a week it got hacked by some random hackers from indonesia. I was honored.  Then the webhost went bankrupt, i moved my site and didn't log on the web.  Then my friend told me he's blogging at blogger and got offered a GMail account. so I thought "i'll start to blog at blogger and get offered a gmail account" because my brain makes no sense like that.  So here I am, blogging for GMail. In the process I am rambeling on about stuff that noone cares about and in the end I will probably not end up with one of these coveted pre-release accounts but I can always hope...  later!

      Tonight we went to look for a new apartment. The apartment we have now has only one bedroom, and the maintenance is very crappy IMO. So anyways, we looked at a place in the next town over, Bellefonte. This is also where I work so i'll actually be able to *take* my lunch :-)  The place is very nice for Bellefonte. It has 3 bedrooms, two baths and a pretty big kitchen. It is located in a quiet in a building built in 1795. Check out  urlLink some pictures .  The lady showing the apartment told us about the previous tenant leaving a crack open in the screen for the window which lead to some bats taking up residence. She continued to say that someone had removed the two bats from the apartment.  Apparently  more than two bats did this because when we were out back we noticed a bat in the guest bathroom. I went inside and opened the screen to let the bat out. Then we noticed some 7 more bats in the master bedroom which were also easily coached outside. Then there was one that decided to fly around *in* the room which had me dancing up and down to try to get it out of the open window...  this get-the-bat-out-of-the-room dance was some good exercise for myself :-)  Sooo  we probably will move there sometime in July.

      I posted some more photos in my photo album. Its from my trip back hom last week to be present at the funeral for my aunt. urlLink Anymoo photos :: r317 :: Holland Hopping   She had passed away during a terrible hiking accident in the southn of spain. They were going to make a 1.5 hr hike up to a mountain hut in good weather, but then the weather turned for the worse and they got lost. some 10 hours later the group minus 2 reached the hut. They had to leave my aunt behind on the mountain side where she passed away due to hypothermia.  So anyway..  my mom arranged for me to be able to go to the funeral where I got to carry the coffin. All in all the ceremony was very good and quite emotional. Afterwards everyone went to a cafe for some coffee and cake and some other drinks.  Since there was a  urlLink Jazz festival  in Enkhuizen, we decided to hang out for a while and listen to some fine jazz music before heading back. The music was good and the beer was cold. All enjoyed with some nice rays of sunshine and a side of "patat met".  Eventually we made our way back to the train station and ride the train back to Hoorn.

      this is a blog posting. My first one at that.  i don't know how often i will post anything here, but i'll give it a shot anyway :)  Today i scheduled my next test for my quest in becoming an MCSE. The test i scheduled is 70-216 aka Implementing and Administering a Microsoft Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure.  It'll be a lot more difficult that the silly "managing a network environment" that I took last month and got an insano i've-been-assimilated-by-microsoft-score of 1102 with nothing to improve on.  Well, i gott a go do something now...  be back

      I have decided that i want to bike to work since we'll be moving to about a mile from work. It seems to me that this  will be an opportunity to get some more bike miles in ;-)    So now my quest is on for a nice bike. One that is cheap, yet also conforms closest to my  urlLink ideal . I'm looking for a bike that has splatter guards and a place to store stuff on the bike, such as a raincoat.  But, the closest thing ive seen that i would be able to afford is some random  urlLink POS bike from walmart . I'm going to have to see if i can find a used bike from somewhere around here.    The problem though is that most bikes are mountain bikes, because they are "cool". I like mountain bikes, but if i have to go to work while its raining, i don't want to get a trail of dirt on my back.  If you have any suggestions, lemme know via comments.... (not expecting any)

      Yay! My studifying all weekend long payed off with more  urlLink cert goodness !  I passed my latest exam towards my MCSE (exam number  urlLink 70-216 ) at the local pearson vue testing center. I studied quite hard for this one actually. I found that it was quite a bit more difficult that the last one I took ( urlLink 70-218 ).   I did have a nice break from studying on sunday. I helped Pat move his gun-safe -- a refridgerator sized box that weighs 1600 pounds. There were about 10 guys there to load it up into the truck but only 5 to load it out of the truck. We ended up pushing the safe along to it's final resting place on cut-up broomsticks just like the egyptians.  ok, so now i have to go back to work...  apply my new knowledge :-)
