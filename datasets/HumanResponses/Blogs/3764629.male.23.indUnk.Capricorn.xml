						   People today go to the cinema if they want to see a movie. It was not like that many years ago, the theatre was the place people would go to be entertained. Dramas was perform in theatre by actor so the people who wrote drama intended that their work be acted out and not as a reading material. Drama is what is call a performing art because they are acted out in front of an audience, intense because what is said is concentrated into a few hours. And is enjoy and judge by a group of people who have come to view them. However it will be impossible for us to see every play that we want, it is far more easier for us to read a play then to see one. Although the experience won’t be the same as seeing it but at least a great art is enjoyed and appreciated by more people. Personally I think seeing a play would be much more fun then reading it

						   I have finish reading the drama yesterday the play is mostly about this young girl Mala, she seems to be traumatize by her childhood memories. She is afraid of men and yet she feels lonely and without attention so she use her body to get attention. At first I blame the mother who kept silence when she should have spoken out, who can’t accept reality and can only pray and hope for help. But as the play unveils I pity the poor mother.I find that all the female character in this play to be weak and are dominated by man maybe it’s the societies fault, where the man lead and the woman follow and where woman are seen but not heard. Mala put the blame on her self. She is incapable to fight back, she knows it’s not her fault but yet she can’t break free of her childhood trauma. She wants attention from man; to her men are the source of pain and pleasure. The lack of attention form her parents made her seeking attention from men, changing her from viewing sex as a source of pain to pleasure. The male characters are mostly bad except for Deepak, again man is seen as the source of pain and pleasure. Deepak is the one that eventually help her to end her childhood trauma, he love her and not her body something that is new and unfamiliar to Mala. 30 days in September I’m looking forward to seeing this play perform, it looks interesting on print and I think I would enjoy it on stage.

						   Do you believe in fate? That what ever we do or how hard we try we can’t escape our fate. How much pleasure and agony that we experience in our lifetime, how much we eat and spend, who we married, who our parents or children will be are all planned, even the way we are going to die someday is all planned out already? That we are all,just living life according to what is already planned out for us. Life is but a play and the world a stage and we are all players, we play our part and eventually we die. We live to perform for others, unconsciously driven to say or do what we are meant to. When someone is involved in a tragic accident, they are actually used, as a tool, be it to educate, warn others, or to be a burden for others.     Can we really believe in fate? That we should leave everything to fate? Because if you believe in fate completely, there will be no motivation within ourselves to push our self to do more, because we are fated how with much we have and will have. Someone is good in his or her study is fated, those who don’t do well are fated too. So at the end of the day who is going to heaven or hell is fated, so why bother trying? Like in the play Oedipus Rex, Oedipus is fated to kill his own father, married his own mother and to be the brother and father to his own children. He by nature would never even think of doing such a sin, but was fated and he can’t avoid it.     Oedipus Rex was the first Greek tragedy play that I study; it is a play and not real life, so it is over dramatizes.

						   Dance, does everyone need to know how to dance? I have always thought of dance as a type of entertainment for the young and the young at heart. It really doesn’t matter which social class you are in because every class has it’s own dance and it is quite universal. If you have read Jane Austen’s novel pride and prejudice, the ballroom where people dance is also a place where people socialize and get to know one another. And in the novel it is where the character tries to fine their future husband or wife.    Who can forget the story Cinderella and her famous glass-slipper or should I say glass-shoes. Here also we see how dance plays a part in the society of the story. The prince was to fine a wife by inviting all the girls from all over the land to attend a dance. Again dance is a form of social interaction between people, a function that provides a relaxing environment for people to come together and get to know one another.  Recently I have visited a web site that has some interesting comment about dance, not just any dance but Ballroom dance. It has some information about its changes and development and how it is still popular even though nowadays we have disco dance and an increasing number of nightclubs and pubs.     http://www.dancetv.com/tutorial/basics/basic2.html  quote “Ballroom dance is also known as social dance because it encourages social interaction between dance partners. While it is a beautiful form of art, it has also at times been an integral part of people’s daily lives for hundreds of years, providing an atmosphere for men and women to gather together, develop friendships and have a good time.” Unquote. So do have a look at this web site to learn more about ballroom dance and other related topics. Visit  http://www.dancetv.com/tutorial/basics/basic2.html

						   William Shakespeare, in his play As you like it, one of the characters, Jaques , declares that everyone is an actor : All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their entrance; And one man in his time plays many parts…. (As you like it,Act II, Scene vii, lines 139-42)  Now is there truth in that statement? are we all actors and player? And the world we live in is a stage?  Everyday we go through life acting, putting up a show. Do we go through life doing what we are expected to do instead of doing what we truly feel like? Are we merely players? We all have our role in society, big or small we play a part in society. We have to play our part and live up to the expectation of our society that is how the world we live in is. We do what we are expected and we expect other to play their part as well.  ‘They have their entrance and one man in his time plays many parts’ How do we get our part to play as? We play the role as someone’s child when we are born to this world so that may be our entrance. We eventually take up more responsibility as we mature. Taking up role as someone’s son, grandson, brother, student and a friend. Some roles are given to us and some we have to earn it.

						   People always worried that they are not beautiful enough and no one would love her/him because of it. People also believe that if someone loves them it’s because they are beautiful. So when someone love them they feel confident about them self. So naturally people who want to feel confidence about them self would fine someone to love them . In reality does it really need to be that way? Everyone more or less would complain about his or her appearance, from being too fat or thin, having dark or fair skin to a small pimple. Complain about their social skills, working performance or productivity, always feeling that they are not good enough compare to others…a lot of girl thinks like this  When a boy come along and waves the flag of love girls would feel that she is beautiful, wanted and better then the other girls, why? Because someone loves her, someone see her as beautiful, all her doubt about her appearance has just disappear. I guess it sound more believable coming from someone other then your own families. And very often innocent girls would want to experience love, try to fulfill their curiosity about love. What is even more worrying is the fact that a lot of girls’ think that they are being love only by their ‘boy friend’ and only him can make them feels that they are beautiful, wanted and important. This mindset has made them so addicted and reliant to their boy friend that they would do any thing to please their boy friends, this in a way is giving power to the man and girls often end up losing their virginity because of it Girls become so reliant on their boy friend that their sense of judgment becomes clouded; they believe that they can’t live without their boy friend or husband. I saw a theatre call ‘Ops Ophelia’ recently and in one of the scene I saw a female character being abuse but yet she goes back to the man not because she loves him but because he knows her and she know him. She have grown so use to him that she can’t even think about losing him, living without him, but does it really have to be this way? We are all born unique and beautiful because God made us all special in our own special ways Human is the most special living being in all of God’s creation. We don’t need any person or things to be ensure of our self.
