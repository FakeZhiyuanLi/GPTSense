      Wow, i haven't updated in a long time. Maybe it's because i haven't done anything really interesting lately. Well i have been doing some interesting stuff but that's not ment for your ears :P. Anyways, my dad got back from phoenix today. That's always good. Also i got all these new games to play from some of my friends. That's even better. Most of the week i've spent time at friends houses. So maybe that can explain for some of the lacking updates. I went to my friend ryders house and watched Pitch black "Vin Dissel is such a bad ass". Haha and a funny thing, ryder told me that vin dissel has been playing D&D for over 23 years. I think that's just funny, cause ryder plays D&D and now he says that Vin Dissel is now his new role model. Haha great stuff.

      This morning i had church as usual, i got to say hi to all my friends as usual, and the usual always came running to give me hugs :). But today, unlike most sundays, after doing childcare with kristan, i had to stay for a meeting. I mean, "I" had to stay for a meeting. Usualy it's just my mom who stays for church meetings but this time i had a meeting of my own to attend to. I had to stay to discuss planning the next 3 months for acolytes and who serves with who. Then we discused the youth ushering schedules and lector schedules. However, this time instead of being just an acoylte, i selflessly voluntiered to be a lector, which means i get to do the 2nd reading sometime in the future during the service. Last time i did that was like 2 years ago. After that there was some talk about a new highschool youth group being formed. Hah. Me and Olivia, the 2 youths in the group that are actually IN highschool, have heard the same thing for the past 3 years. "Oh, we'll be getting a new high school youth group starting!!!" "We're gunna try it again!" "Don't Worry, this time it will work" Hahahaha sure  Oh well. Haha, the funniest thing is that there's this kid at my church, her name is victoria, she's a big fan of buffy the vampire slayer. Heh, we were talking about something related to self defense and then she mentioned that she had like 3 containers of pepper spray. I was like "haha could you give me one? that would be tight" and guess what? Muahahahaha, today i got some peper spray, so dont mess with me or i'll spray you!!! Bitch!!!!!

      Today my dad leaves for phoenix arizona for one of his many confences he has this year. This summer has been very productive for him, he's traveled all around the United states more than usual this year. He's been to chicago, las vegas, new york, manucha "a city in oregon", and now he's leaving for phoenix. All these trips have occoured in a 3 month time period. Now i would say that's a lot of traveling. Oh well, hehe my dad felt so guilty not being able to take me on any of these trips that yesterday, me and him went to fred meyers around 10:30 at night and he bought me some Haagan Datz ice cream and some black cherry cream sodas. Awww :). I hope he has a good time in phoenix

      Well i got back from registration, every thing seems to be in order, except for the fact i had to wait about an hour to get my locker to work right, our combo wasn't even remotley close to what it actuall was. Oh well, this year my locker is in C-Wing, which is where all the stinky and nasty freshmen hang out, man i swear during 6th period, it stinks like shit in C-Wing, sigh. At least i got registered and i have everything in order, now i have to wait until school ACTUALLY starts.

      Huzzah! I got some sleep finaly. Now all i have to do is wait until 12:30 pm, when i get my mom to take me to school for resgistration. The fight outside i guess got resolved, because i haven't heard any more yelling so far today, so that's good. Now i guess i better get some chow before i head out the door.

      Well its 11:36 at night, and i cant sleep cause some fucking retards cant stop fighting. Me and my dad were just doing an evening milk run when we come home to some of our neighbors getting into a fist fight. I don't know where the hell they came from but they seem to have moved into the house thats to our left. These two white teenage crackers start fighting about something i don't know what's going on, but pretty soon it errupts into fists flying and words floating across the airwaves into my ears. This went on for like 20 minutes and then some other neighbors decided to come out to see what was going on. It kept going on and on until i was too fucking pissed to hear anymore, so i got my dad to call the cops to come down here. Two cop cars came down and right now they're sorting things out. There better not be anything else going on tonight cause i don't want to listen to any pissing and moaning while i at least try to get some sleep for registration tomorow. I don't care if i misspelled anything in this paragraph. I'm tired, i'm sleepy and i'm going to bed. Leave me alone.

      The dreaded day is almost upon us. Registration for school is tomorow :(. Oh well, at least i get to be a junior. Which is great because during assemblys that take place in the gym, freshmen and sophomore never get to see any of the cheerleader's action. But this year, we're part of the junior/senior crowd!!!! w00t! So we get more privilages. Hell, we even get our own prom!!! Hahaha, yeah. Will I ever get a date for the prom? Chances are slim to none, but i'll never lose faith!!!

      Wow. More and more every day I always seem to cruise eBay for items that i want. I'm currently looking at an Apple iBook for a reasonably good price "Not saying how much, you might take it :P" and if i decide to get this iBook and actually get it, i get free shipping. Now that's a kick ass deal. All i need is my dad and his account and i'm in business. I've always wanted a laptop because both my parents have one. "My dad has gone through 3!!! 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and i feel left out. So if i do get this laptop, i'll be part of the laptop family :D.

      Today the U.N HQ in iraq was bombed, at least 13 people were killed. Of course it was done by a group of iraqi terrorist, but there are no leads so far. Man why did we ever decide to invade iraq in the first place. "OMFG THEY HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!?!?!?!?!". OH WOW, SO DOES CHINA AND RUSSIA AND KOREA. But they just have nuclear weapons, we're after BIOLOGICAL weapons. Like anthrax and VX Gas. There's nothing for me to do i guess. Oh well  Yesterday evening my dad actually took me to Krispy kreme on 82nd. Man, we waited in line for almost a half an hour. But it was awsome when we got inside. We got to see the doughnuts being made and glazed. Heck, we saw our batch get made and then put into our box. We got a free sample in line and wow, they tasted good for 200 callories a piece. Besides getting a dozen of original glazed, we also got a box of assorted doughnuts that me and my dad chose. So as i sit here, stomach ache in hand, i proclaim that for a good tasting doughnut, Krispy Kreme is the way to go!!!

      Waaah. Today i was playing americas army, and when i logged in, it said "No User Record'. At first this scared me for a moment because, even though i've done ALL the training, "sniper, medic etc" and i only have a measly 22 honor, I thought that I would have to start all over. But because i'm not a senseless n00b, i decided to check out the offical forums online. And it turns out that many other people are having the same problem too. Oh well. The only online game i have installed on my computer is now gone until they fix the authentication servers. :(  I guess i'm stuck to some offline games. I reinstalled Half-Life for some reason, maybe because single player is fun. I'm not going to install Counterstrike though. As there are wayyyy to many hackers. I just beat system shock 2. Ancient game, but very fun. Kind of like alien versus predator, because of all the spookyness involved. Guess i should try to have some fun for the rest of the evening.

      Sigh, well the picnic could have gone a little better. Some of our kids tried to get on the marry-go-round while this other group of kids were just sitting on it doing nothing. Our church group asked nicely if we could use it, and what do they do? They just fucking spaz out at our group, swearing and cussing at a group of little kids that just want to use the merry go round. In the end, our little group of kids came to me and asked if i could sort it out? What the hell am i supposed to do? Go over there and throw rocks at them? In the end i felt like i didn't want to create a situation, "Not that i'm a pussy or anything, it's just a fucking merry go round". So i  just let them get a chaperone to settle it out, good for us because we did get it settled out with everyone being happy.  God sometimes i do feel like i'm a pussy when it comes to those things. I always say about how i'm so tough and that i'll beat anyone up if i get pissed off, but the fact is that i'm not that kind of person. I just want everyone in the end to be happy instead of pissed off. When i got back home, our new neighbor, who's about my age, or maybe about 2 years older actually introduced himself to me. We talked very breifly and he asked if i wanted to go party with him. Me not being the party type "yet" i made some bullshit lie and said no.  Sometimes though, I feel like just leaving the comptuer for one day and actually just, taking in some of todays teenage culture, like an actual party... Then again, maybe he was just trying to find a reason to take my shit somehow. Either way, i'm just pissed off today.

      Ahh, yesterday was a refreshing day. I got to go play some games at the arcade, mainly racing games and some DDR. I also won some useless animals from the claw machine, but oh well, those are fun to play. After the arcade, i went back to my friend john's house and ate some papa murpheys pizza. Not my favorite, but hey, it's pizza, so that works for me :-D  Today i get to go down to Mt Scott to go swimming. The reason i'm going today is because this year is our first annual church picnic. So if all goes well, i'll see some people i know swimming there. And now im at the legal age to be in the spa pool!!!! Woooo! Either way, it's a hot day, so i need the refreshing swim, and after swimming there's a barbeque outside in the park. So swimming and food all in one day, and the food is free!! Oh can the day get any better!?

      Woohoo, today was the last day of summer school for me. To celebrate, we all ordered dominos pizza for the class. We had about 12 pizzas ($88.00 total) and had a blast. As we usualy do, most of use sat around and played cards, most people were playing a game called spoons, some played ERS" and of course, who at Portland Public schools doesnt know how to play 13. Unfortianatly we didn't play for money, because even at summer school, gambling is not allowed "however our teacher broke those rules in class while we gambled against him once :)"  So 6 weeks of waking up at 7:30 and coming home at 12:00 at noon are finaly over. Now i can finaly get to things that i've some what wanted to do during the few remaining days of summer. One of the major things is that i really need to START READING THE NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK :O. I've only read the first chapter so far, sad ain't it :/. Oh well  I guess for a celebration, "Actually, it's my friends celebration" I get to go to gateway tomorow and play some games at the arcade. Maybe i'll play some DDR if i feel like i can actually stay up with my friends who can play songs like Max 300 and shit like that. Best i can ever do is like Orion 78 Civ mix on heavy at this point. Haven't played for months. Maybe i should play some on my home pad some more.

      I got an email back from tech support, guess i have to send them my card. Which means i have to switch to my friend johns old Video card for the next coupple of days. I sold him my 'Better' geforce 2, beacuse at that time i thought i wouldnt need it anymore, so he gave me his old one plus some money and software.  Other than that, today i got my Highschool schedule, Looks like i got into all the classes i wanted, except for physics "cause i really suck at science". I got into algebra 3-4, which is a releif cause today i found out that no matter what i'm getting a C in geometry, cause im taking that over summer school. I'm getting a C because i screwed up badly on a major test :(. But the important part is that i got into the class i want to major in, Computer software technology. So it's all good. Lets hope junior year will be better then my sophomore year.  Here's how it goes down P1/2   - Compsoft 3                   - Mr Diss P3      - English 5/6                   - Mr Melton P4      - Adv Algebra 3-4            -Mr Slebos Lunch  P6       -Princtech 1-2                -Mr Wren  P7       -Us History                     -Mr Ryan P8       -Spanish 3-4                   -Ms Aerts

      Grrr, The graphics card that i have is really starting to piss me off. My dad got me a Geforce 4 Ti 4200 last december. Yeah i know, why am I complaining? Maybe it's the fact that when ever i try to play a game with high end graphics (eg: UT2K3, Americas army 1.9.0), over a period of time, my card will just suddenly say "I give up" and crash my computer by displaying crap all over my moniter, and there's nothing i can do to fix it. I've let it slide by for the past couple of months but today i've had it. I've contacted technical support to see if i can either A.) Get it fixed myself or B.) Send it in and get a new one. All i want is to be able to play some games! Is that so hard to do!!!!

Speaking of vietman2k, he's the main reason i started this site, so maybe you should go check his site out while you're at it. Also i've added links to my website from where i store various pictures. Check it out sometime.  *Note, my site doesnt seem to like me directly putting the image from there, onto my blog, so i had to make it a link instead *Another note, The internet doesnt like me to post pictures as a link itself, so if all else fails, just use this, http://geocities.com/omgwtfbbq/Files/jiggi30.jpg

      So today I actually had my first chance to taste a krispy kreme donut. However it wasn't oven fresh, it was microwaved from the refridgerator. My dad brought some home last night from a friends house cause they were in her freezer. From what I could taste, it was pretty good. Though I bet the oven fresh ones are much better.

      It's the end of the week, you know what time it is! It's posting on max's blog time!!! Ahhh yes, another wonderful week has finaly come to a close. Let's recap what happened this week. Last friday, we had a assembly to recognize our fall sports teams. Every class was representing them selves, the stinky freshmen of 07, the even more stinky sophomores of 06, THE SUPER ELITE CREW OF OWNAGE FROM THE CLASS OF 2005! and the seniors no one cares about. Everyone couldnt compare to us when someone tried to shout out their class number. I mean, comeon, 05 ripped up the stands with everyone shouting it out over everyone else, hell even the cheerleaders made a cheer for us only and no one else!! TAKE THAT HIPPIES.  On tuesday there was a late opening from which i went early anyways cause i needed to finish up my homework. So that was fun and lame at the same time because i finished my homework in about 10 minutes which left me about 2 hours to roam around the school doing nothing.   Wednesday, i dont recall what i did, except during study hall me and a few people played some underground games of 13 for money, i won some money so thats even better.  Thursday, I basicly did the same thing, same with today  Let's hope things get more interesting next week

      Second week of school is over, maybe i should just update every friday. Good news is, my graphics card came back. That's super, also i installed XP, that's super too, bad news is, if i dont find a working crack soon, i'll have to put another OS on in 30 days.  Weeeeeee, my grades so far are pretty kick ass, about 3 A's so far that i know of. Hopefuly my CST and Algebra grades will improve, but for all i know, I could have an A in CST so far. Or a B. I'm just not sure about what im getting in that class right now, so until next week, or if i think of something else, that's all for now.

      The first week of school is finaly past me. Ahhhh. How refreshing it does feel. Why have i not updated in a while? Well mainly i didn't feel like it! There!!! What are you going to do to me anyways! "You being the reader :P". I got my return address mail from cardxpert, saying that they have received my package, now it's only a matter of time until i get my geforce 4 back and maybe start playing some of my games that i "want" to play. But this year, i'm deciding to devote more time to my class work, so maybe i'll just play games on the weekends instead of during the weekdays, but maybe that will change. All i know is, My ass better earn some good grades this year.

      Well the first two days ofs chool have gone pretty good. All the clases i'm in don't seem to be too bad or too hard. All the teachers seem to be educated at what they're teaching. Unlike some of the teachers I had the last 2 years. CST seems fun, but we're going to have homework every day. Waaaaa. Either way, sometimes that's a good thing. You can learn more if you have lots of homework. English seems to be an easy class to have this year, like last year, there's going to be speeches and some novel reading in the future. Algebra 3-4 looks a little chalanging. The first 2 days we had 2 tests!!!! Wtf is that!!?!?!? I hopefuly get to drop my science class so i can take Chemistry 1-2 over Nightschool/Summer school. If i did that, i would have a Hour and a half long lunch. Spanish 3-4 seems cool. From what ms cleeton said, if you get an A on any test, you dont have to do any homework until the next test! Kick Ass!! And then of course there's US-History with Mr Lilebo. OMG he kicks ass, i had him last year for global studies, funny as hell and pretty educated.

      Well, the dreaded day is upon me, school has started today, 9/4/03. Junior year is finaly upon me. Sigh. Another year at Benson. Hopefuly i will have a much better time then i did last year. Sophomore year for me was hell, freshman year for me was better in my opinion. But what is there to say about junior year? Nothing yet, maybe i'll like this year. Maybe being a junior is the best year in highschool. That's what some people say. That junior year is their best year. Oh well, guess i'll just have to see for myself.

      Got recap?  Monday - School started, had fun doing things that i cant remember.   Tuesday- I forget what i did that day too. Probably nothing too interesting.  Wednesday - Nothing interesting that day at all either. Except parent teacher confrences, so that means i got off at 10:49                                    B              U                  T ................ Thursday - This day started out like any other day, except for the fact that it also ended early for us here at benson polytechnic highschool, due to it still being parent teacher confrences. We got to hand out the first edition of Tech Pep, our school newspaper to students all around the school. Then at lunch, me and the other felow tech pep staff recreated ourselves with a party in mr meltons room.       After school me and my mom, and my friend Ryder, and his friend Brian all went down to memorial coliseum to hear Michael Moore speak, author and director of such documentrys as Roger and me, and Bowling for colombine.  For those of you who dont know, Michael Moore is one of those people who travels around the united states doing Documentrys that show some interesting things relating to the American culture, for example in bowling for colombine, why america is so Obsessed with guns, we have the biggest homicide rateing in the whole world. While we were there, he talked about the Bush administration, the war in Iraq, some exerpts from his upcoming book, Seven questions for George of arabia, and even had a trivia game. Other then that, I would say that thursday was the highlight of this week. Oh and for a crowd estimate, there were about 8,500 people present in the coloseum.     Friday - Guess what? The only thing that happened was that it was the end of the week!!! And also it was my grandpa's birthday. HAPPY BDAY GRANDPA :D    Saturday To Now - I sat on my ass and did nothing but work and games.                                                        Now wasn't that all just interesting?

      Time for the weekly recap  Monday - I signed up to be in the tech-pep newspaper at Benson HS. I'm the official photographer because i have my own camera. Also instead of going to study hall 6th period, i'm now working in Mr Meltons room typing up storys for the paper to be edited later, and then published  Tuesday- Nothing really interesting happened. Only thing interesting is that i had night school. That was the highlight of the day, in a way  Wednesday - I got a working flash for my camera, so i was playing around with it the whole day. Taking some pictures for the news paper.  Thursday - My friend john signed up for the chess club. So after school i went down there and snapped some shots for the news paper. Nothing else happened that was interesting.  Friday - Today i went to the deli to get another teryaki rice bowl. Man those things are good. Other then that nothing happened that was interesting.  Wow, wasn't this week so interesting. It just compels you to come to this site more often. :O. Anyways. I get to have most of my fun tomorow on saturday. PSAT's are tomorow, i signed up for the hell of it. I'll probably get the worlds lowest score, but hey it's practice! After that im going to my friend's sister's birthday party at chuckie cheese, so that will be entertaining. Sunday i have nothing planned.  Such an intersting week!!!! Now that i think of it, this week blew, nothing cool happened.

      How bored must i be that i'm writing an entry from here at school on one of the libray's computers. I'm not supposed to be doing this "But i have ways of covering what i can do, Thanks to my minimized google page :)". Since it's the end of the school week here at wonderful Benson polytechnic highschool, I guess i'll recap what has happened so far.  Monday, I came back from hunting to find out that 2 english essays and a 100 point notebook were due, but that's ok. I did the essays already, but i still have to work on that notebook. Also i missed 2 assignments in my spanish class that brought my grade down from a 91% to a 85%. Ouch!!!! Also i missed an exam in US History. Woot woot :(. I actually decided to check out the Deli that's at the lloyd plaza. They have some bomb teryaki chicken rice bowls for sale there that tasted hella good. I should buy another one next monday.  Tuesday, Nothing really happened yesterday. They moved my study hall from the cafeteria up to mr thibideau's   room. And there is no more playing cards or listening to music anymore. It's all quiet and the only thing you can do in there is either work on stuff you have to do or just go to sleep . I had some pizza hut pizza that day instead because it took too damn long to get my rice bowl the other day.  Wednesday, today. Today started off rather shitty. I came to school to find out that i left my wallet at home!!! ahhh bullshit!!! :(. So i had to starve as lunch by eating off other people. Other then me being stupid, we had our homecoming assembly today. For me, it was my "First homecoming assembly" more like it. The first one in freshman year i was sick and had to miss it. Sophomore year they just moved it to after 8th period, so i skipped it. Nothing really interesting happened. Except for the senior date raffle. Some fat chick won a date with this one senior dude and everyone was cracking up, She really got lucky :P.  So as I write this here in the library. Know this, I just finished all my homework that i needed to do in this study hall. And now to search the internet for things related to the battle at west point. Adios!

      Whew, i just got back from hunting with some of my relatives for the first time. We saw tons of deer, but no Buck "The only deer that we are ALLOWED to shoot" It was pretty fun. I got to shoot a gun for the first time, a .22 rifle. Not so powerful compared to my uncle's guns, but i got to shoot at some targets. I did pretty good, got at least 2 in the middle.........out of 20 shots.... STFU I KNOW I SUCK.  Anyways, on our way back from hells canyon, which is just on the border of Idaho, we got a flat tire, so we had put on the spare in the back of the suburu and drive to La Grande at 45 MPH on the highway, which was extremely tedious. When we got to La Grande, none of the tire shops were open. But my dad got to a gas station and asked for places to call. We finaly got to calling one of the owners of "Comercial Tires", we went there and in about 20 minutes, almost the whole staff was there to help us. It was cool but in a way funny at the same time.  So this weekend was very productive, also when i got in the door, my new Ti-83 Plus silver edition was waiting for me on the table. So great things have come to me so far. Lets keep them coming.

      Happy thanksgiving everyone, although thanksgiving was thursday, it's still ok to say it anyways.  Monday - First day w/o john in CST :(. Nothing really interesting happened that day. Except mucho diablo II when i got home. Oh wait, there was something. A train caused me to be late to school which was super gay.  Tuesday- We got our Micro Computing books in CST to start off the new quarter with. Nothing else really happened. Except more diablo II. Oh wait, i was late again, this time by 2 trains. AT THE SAME TIME. WTF!?!?!?!? But when i got there, Mr. Diss wasn't there to yell at me. Hell he wasnt there for 45 minutes after i had arrived. So in that time everyone in the class, including myself, played some hearts on the computer network. In my History class we watched some movies on Freestyle motocross because Mr Lillebo is a Motocross man. He was bragging about how he knows all these people in the professional videos that we were watching.  Wednesday - Weeee. It was a half day due to thanksgiving break, so we got out around 11:42 i think, maybe earlier. The only real interesting thing about this day was that we got our microcomputing boards in CST which are basically breadboards with IC's and a keypad on them. In Lillebo's class we discussed various turkey recipies. That was mostly it.  Thursday (Thanksgiving) I went with my dad to my uncles house for thanksgiving dinner. Most of the time i was with my cousin chris in his room playing games on his computer. Mostly it was just us taking turns on GTA3, then he played some emporer "battle for dune" and Delta force. We really had nothing to do so me and him just hung out in there. The food was great. My grandma fell down in the bathroom which scared the shit out of everyone. It sounded hard too. She cut her head on the wall and there was some blood on the floor but it wasn't serious enough that she had to go to the hospital. She stayed for dinner all the way so that's good.  Friday - Mostly i stayed home here playing games. But i went out with my mom to blockbuster and rented a few DVD's with her. I rented Rambo : First blood and Evil dead.  Saturday- I woke up around 10:30 and watched Evil Dead on my computer. Oh man that movie is total ownage. I've seen army of darkness, which is somewhat related to the Evil Dead story, so i kinda expected what i would see. I think it was a masterfuly done movie. I could explain things about the movie but i wont, I will just say go out and buy it. At 2:00, I got myself a haircut and went over to Gen-X with my mom and got a new hoodie and a new jacket. So now i look gangsta. We also went and saw Master and Commander. That movie is basically a never ending chase between these two ships. It had good action though so i wont complain.  Sunday - Sunday remains to be seen. We'll just have to wait and see tomorow..........

      Well, although this isn't the end of the week, i just thought that i would make a brief entry about this whole week in order to save myself some time.  Monday - Nothing really interesting happened that was really any noticible. All i really did was play some Diablo II and Americas army  Tuesday- Late opening, so that was awsome. Although i got here early to try to work on the upcoming issue of tech pep some more "well mostly i just hung out with my friends"  Wednesday - Holy shit this day was gay and cool at the same time. I woke up as usual around 7:30, got breakfast and headed out twards school around 7:44. I got there at 8:44. I was 29 minutes late to class because traffic was super jammed up because all the storm drains were clogged. But the cool part of the day? It snowed for the first time in 3 years here at portland. So during the end of 2nd period and the begining of 3rd period, me and a few people were lobbing snowballs at eachother. This doesn't happen very much in portland so we took this to our advantage. Other then the weather, my grades came in the mail this week. Most of them were pimp shit. I got an A in history, A in english, A in spanish 3-4 but a C in algebra 3-4. Grrr, Fu slebos, and my CST grade was empty for no reason.  Thursday - Today, well so far the only real interesting thing that happened was that during 6th period "the period im in now" I went to go get some money for some food and guess who showed up to surprise me? My dad! Heh that was interesting. So i showed him the deli where i get my food and we both got some terryaki chicken bowls. He paid for me being the nice man that he is "Thanks dad :)"  And tomorow, sadly, is my friend at Benson, John phan's last day here. He's moving up to clackamas to his new house that they just bought, and now he's going to attend Clackamas highschool. =(. Other then that, i guess that covers it for this week. Maybe something will happen tomorow?

      Been almost two weeks since i last updated my blog. Why? because there really hasn't been anything to talk about. Last week nothing interesting happened at all. Except i went to the lloyd deli almost every day that week, save saturday and sunday. This week only consisted of wednesday, thursday and friday. So it was a really short week. I also went to the deli every day this week. Nothing has really happened that is really worth discussing. Well, i take that back, I went to see matrix revolutions. That's the only really thing that has been interesting that has happened over the course of 2 weeks. Lets say what I think of the movie  First off, the movie has no real story at all what so ever. Save for the fact that Zion is about to be destroyed by the evil machine world, and that agent smith is turning into some sort of a demi-god. That's basically all i understood in the whole movie. It starts off where reloaded left off, Neo is still in a-coma after what happened when he destroyed all the sentinals with his powers in the real world, which i still don't understand how he can do that. Then it comes down to that Zion is about to be destroyed, so they gather all these machines that look like things straight out of mech warrior to maintain the defense of Zion. Then at the moment of truth, the sentinals break through and it's one hell of a slaughter. There's guns blazing everywhere, sentinals falling down by the hundreds. I swear there were like millions of sentinals coming down from the crack in the wall of Zion it was insane, so was the ammount of detail that they put into the action sequence of this whole scene. Anyways, i thought this part was a little over done, but my opinion on action films is this. No matter what, if there's action involving lots and lots of guns for about 20 minutes, that's awsome and i wont complain.  Then there was the final battle between agent smith and Neo. Smith, with his unexplainible power to copy himself, takes on Neo in the final battle to resolve the Matrix Trillogy. I thought that this fight was a little bit rediculous because i mean, it's like Live action Dragon Ball Z (If you've seen the cartoon series, you'd know what i mean). Neo and smith were flying in the air fighting eachother (Minus all the energy wave attacks and constant moaning and constipation sounds in DBZ) and in the end... well, you should see it for yourself. Then there's the ending and man, the ending was retarded in my opinion. However, this movie wasn't all too bad. I only liked it for the action because i want one of those Armored Units that was in the defense of Zion. I think that would be bad ass.

      Well, i'm a day late in updating. Mainly because of what i did over the weekend. Anyways. Let's cover what i did last week. Better yet, let's say what i remember  Monday -              Nothing Tuesday -             Nothing Wednesday -         Nothing Thursday-             Nothing Friday -                My friend Kirk from middle school came down and visited me all the way up from packwood washington. He came around 5:00 in the evening. It was halloween so we got to pass out candy to kids and watch some movies on the tv. Well, ok only one movie, wishmaster 4. I love the demon in that movie, he's always destroying people and making them cry. I love the line "I wish you would put up a better fight" some guy says to the demon when he's a pussy human trying to fight back against the bouncer. Then the demon goes "Your wish is granted'. Then the demon goes all bad ass and RUINS HIS SHIT. He grabs the guys hand and sqeezes it until it exploded. I thought that was hardcore. Then after that, We watched Jason X on my DVD player in my room. As corney as the movie looks, it's actually pretty good. I recomend it  Saturday - Ah yes. Saturday was a hell of a long day. First we woke up around 6:30 because my mom had forced me to go to acolyte day with the bishop which is in corvallis. She also invited Kirk to come along, so he did. This event happens once every year. So we had to be at our church around 7:15 and my mom always wakes us up TOO DAMN EARLY. So that was a problem. Anyways, we got to the church, got in our assigned cars and headed out twards corvalis. Having nothing to do for an hour in the car, i just sat back and jammed to my Crystal Method CD i yanked from my english class. When we got there, we put our vestments on and later proceded into the church where the ceremony was being held and had a ball. The new bishop, Johncy Itty was there and we were all excited on meeting him. I'll admit, he's a great guy, but he cant sing. After wards we went to watch the OSU beavers take on the University of Arizona wildcats and oh my god. Arizona got stomped by OSU 52-26. So that was enjoyable. After the game, we all went out to burger king to get some dinner, then we headed on back.  Oh, The day isn't over yet  Around 8:00, me and kirk got back to my house and hung out with my dad for a while. Then we decided to go to where kirk and his mom were staying and pick up his paintball gun and play around with it. But we needed ammo. So we walked from my house all the way up to walmart and bought 100 Paintballs and some C02 canisters. After that, we took the bus all the way up to where kirk's mom was and got the gun. After he introduced me to everyone that was there, we then went back on the bus and headed back twards my house. It's a good thing no cops were on the bus, i might have gotten my ass capped. But since it was really  Late in the day for shooting stuff, we said that we would shoot things in the morning.  Think that's it for the day? Hell No  At 11:30, Kirk had invited me to go see the Rocky horror picture show which was playing at that one theatre next to cleavland highschool. Me, being that i have never even been to one of these performances, was in for one hell of a shock. I got into the theatre at 11:30 at night, and it was like a party. People having a blast even before the movie was starting. There were first performances by some of the people in the audidence that have basicly memorized the whole movie. Then they had "Virgin Call" where people who had never seen the movie were invited onto the stage for some fun. They had the group that was full of 17 and under just get yelled at by the people in the audience saying "FUCK" and then the announcer guy would say. "Congratulations, you've just been fucked by 83 people all at once". But me, trying to be cool and relying on my friend kirks information, i posed as an 18 year old and it worked. Kirk said that the 18+ crowd would get auctioned off to people in the audience. Like girls would buy you and stuff. Well let me say this. Kirk must have been smoking crack because i didn't get auctioned off, but rather... well. You'll have to talk to me in real life to find out the true story. Anyways, the movie was pretty cool. Although people were making fun of the people in the movie, because they knew what to say when there was pauses in between lines. So i guess i should rent it to really hear what they said.  After the movie, the ride that me and kirk were going to get a ride home with had to leave, because her husband wasn't feeling so well. So kirk used his massive macking skills and got us a ride with 2 college chicks that we didn't even know. One of them was pretty cool looking. Anyways, since we were a little hyper after the whole ordeal, even though it was about 2:00 in the morning at that time, they asked us what we wanted to do or where we should go. I quote kirk "Well, anywhere but home!". Since they were really basicly new to oregon, they only knew one place in particular. A starbucks in Beaverton. Well isn't that great. Coffee at 2:00 at night with complete strangers. I think that's kick ass. So we had coffee and we learned eachothers names and where everyone goes to school. Then after about 15 minutes we decided to head back home. They droped me and kirk off at my house and we said good bye. Kirk, trying to act like he's so cool the whole time, actually managed to get a kiss from one of them, even though he looked like he was so desperate. Me, i just stayed formal and said good bye. Don't call me a pussy or anything but I don't think that boning people who are 7 years older than you is my style. After that we got back at my house around 3:30 AM. We at this time were hella tired so we just went to bed. But then at like 4:00 i had the maddest nosebleed ever, but i wont go into detail there. I don't even know how the hell it happened, it just did.   Sunday - Ahh sunday, this wasn't so long. I woke up around 9:45 which is about 15 minutes later then when i usualy go to church. Since i promised everyone at the game i was going to be there at church. Which ment that i would have to give up shooting the paint ball gun. But i got to keep a canister of 100 paintballs to myself. Kirk had to go home around 11:00 or so in the morning because when i got back, like he said, he was gone. How ever, the major event of the evening was my churches Centenial "Celebrating Being Around For 100 Years" so that was fun. Free food, free drinks, talk to friends etc.. So that was all good.  And i am writing this today on 11/3/03 at 10:24 at night, and i started writing around 10:00. So damn. This is a lot of typing. I hope you can see that this week i did some stuff. And i'm still tired from saturday so i bid you all adeau and good night.

      Wooooohooooo. Christmas Break is upon me starting at 3:00 PM.  Monday - Nothing really happened that day. Except when i got lunch i had to wait 15 minutes because the chicken had run out at the deli. When i got back to Meltons room, he had locked the room. So Basicaly i was out of look. So i hung out at Flemmings room where everyone that doesnt have anything to do goes. So basicly me, Eric, Charlie and Greg basicly partied there. I was there until 10 minutes till 1:14 because i wanted to get my backpack back from Meltons room. I got it back so it was all good  Tuesday - I had Bagels in meltons room for lunch. Noah's bagels. So that was yummy. He got some Strawberry and Regular Cream cheese. Other then that I went to flemmings room again.  Wednesday - LOTR, return of the king opened up. My mom got to go at 3:45 w/o me :(. Also my friend Ryder went to go and see it at 6:00. While I didn't get to see it at all :(. That's basicly what happened. Well i take that back, i had 3 tests that day. 1 in CST, 1 in Math and 1 in Spanish.  Thursday - Had more bagels during Lunch. I stayed in melton's that day because it was a funky schedule. We got out at 2:25 because the Staff had an assembly, Not the students, but the staff. So that was interesting. Oh yeah, I got krispy kreme from the Vica cafe for $3.50. 6 doughnuts. I could only get to 4 before i got sick.  Friday - Well since i'm writing this entry from the CST class, i don't really know what's going to happen later on. Except that during the Tech-Pep meeting we're going to have a party where Mr Melton is probably going to buy some big town hero sandwiches. Also during History, we get to have Festivus. So I get two parties today to look forward to.  During the break, i'll try to update more frequently because i'll probably have the time to do so.

      Fear me, for i am typing this from my CST class in 1st and 2ndperiod. Mr Diss cant see my window here and neither can I, so lets get this over with quick.  Monday - You know what happened today. Absolutly nothing.  Tuesday - Nothing happened that day either. Except i Got Soldier of fortune 2 from nick.  Wednesday - We were playing around with my hotline server here in CST from my house. So we all had a party on my DSL server at home. We couldnt download anything but we basically had a chat party :0.  Thursday - Nothing really happened that day, but that's ok. I had subway :) "Litteraly too :D" WEll wait, stuff did happen. I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist at 7:30 in the morning. Also when i came to school, 10 minutes earlier, a freshman and a senior were caught having sex in the bathroom. The esnior got arrested for statutory rape because he was over 18. Sucks for him, I think i know the guy too. Mr Nick Robinson. He's in my spanish class and my nighschool chemistry class. Shooulda waited till college!.  Firday - Nothing really happened that day. Just lunch and school. Well, David invited me to PDX lan downtown. Being that i haven't "REALLY" gone to a Lan party. I was like "What the hell, why not". So basicly i said yes. Cost was $10 and it was a BYOC event "Bring your own computer"  Saturday - The day of the Lan party - Oh man this event was pretty fun. Most of the people here i didn't know but that's ok. Some of the people there i knew from benson. Well ok, mainly one, but there were other people there that i knew the names of by looking at theit pictures in the yearbook. Most of the games that we played were Halo and Battlefield 1942. I never really had battlefield 1942 until now. Oh man that game is awesome. You can do anything in that gane. MY favorite thing is on Midway island, taking command of a battleship and go ship hunting. I think the battlefield games were the best part. But some of the halo games were great too.  10 Player CTF was great on blood gulch. Weeee, me and my rocket warthog rip shit up. After that party, me and my dade went out to get some Chocolate  as a treat. He had lost his cell phone earlier in the day so that was a bummer :(. He had to get a new one because someone stole his while we were out. It probably droped on the ground as he got in the car. So that sucks.  Sunday - Nothing really happened. Except for the fact i basically played battlefield all day. Weeeee. Best game ever.   Oh well, i've evaded Diss so far. Next time i'll try to update saturday.

      Man, you know when i said "Let's see what will happen" on sunday? Oh man, something happened. So i'll just start there this week  Sunday - My mom let me drive home from church in her 82 red civic. I mean holy shit, i've only been driving one time before that, so basicly this was my 2nd time to drive. And this wasn't in a parking lot. Haha man was this scarry. I drove from church onto holgate, then down to where we live. i was on the home stretch when i hit a parked car right on the turn to our street. *OOPS*. But i didn't do a hit and run. I caused a fender bender and the damage totaled to around $2,000. Go damage!!!!!!!! Luckaly our insurence covered it. So it's all good. Other than that scarry incident nothing really happened.  Monday - Nothing much happened. Except i called my dad during 6th period "Cause its a free period" to ask if he put a deposit into my account. He said he did so i beleived him. After i called him i went down to the bank to get some money, expecting to see $50 more in my account, but after that talk we had while i was eating lunch with him one day, i had $100 more in my account  "SWEET", so after i got that money, i headed down to the deli and got some finger licken chicken.  Tuesday - Late opening. Wohooo. Basicaly all i did was play Lots of Zelda - Link to the past on my Gameboy SP. I beat the dark dungon in an hour cause i kept dying. So what, i suck :P. After that i remembered that there were still 2 burritos in the fridge in my class, so i just ate those instead of going to the deli.  Wednesday - Nothing much happened. Went to the deli again cause i like rice and chicken.  Thursday - Nothing happened that day either, except i wanted to save my money for tomorow, so i basicly fasted for no reason until i got home for dinner. Actually i take that back, There were doughnuts that were from the site council meeting Mr Melton brought up for us to have. Oh man they were great.  Friday - Saving my money payed off, infact, i still got to save money because the latest edition of tech pep came out "our school news paper". So during 3rd period we got to circulate them around the school to kids. I got to be the Captain of the routes so i handed out the sheets which tell people which rooms to go to, along with the papers they needed. So while i watied for people to hand out papers, i sat in the back of the class waiting to give extra papers to those who needed them. I also got myself one of the last dougnuts for myself.  During lunch. We celebrated in the Tech-Pep meeting and had a great lunch. Mr Melton ordered some Big-Town hero sandwiches and we had a party basically. Those things tasted better than those Fred-Meyer sandwiches we had last time. Because these had mayo on them. Along with tomatoes. I thought that this issue of tech pep was the best. People loved it because it had information people cared about. Like the fact that incoming freshman will be decided by a lottery, instead of admission requirements.  Saturday - Today - Nothing really happened this day either, my dad's in astoria since yesterday preforming the nutcracker. My mom got Evil dead 2 from blockbuster, so thats cool, maybe i'll watch it tomorow.   Well that's all i can think of for this week.

      Man. This was a very laid back week. I didn't do much at all this week. But, from what i can remember, i can say this was very lame and boring.  Monday : Just did stuff in school. Talked with people online during 6th period, had lunch from the deli. That was about it.  Tuesday - Late opening, i went to school around 8:45 so i could do some math homework, after that i just sat outside the door to CST for about half an hour. Later on, had some lunch, then went to Flemmings. Mr Green, the campus security, came in and Flemming ratted me out, along with my friends Charlie and Eric. So we were sent to the office to be put into a study hall. "Even though i'm actually in study hall, i just never go. You don't have to either, doesn't count against your grades". The secretary asked us to fill out an incident report, but Mr Green made some cover for us, so we didn't have to do that, because Mr Green is awesome. So for the remainder of 6th period, Me, Charlie and Eric were sent to Thorseness's room for study hall. "Thorseness just recently got treated for Cancer and now he's finaly back, yay :)". That's mainly it  Wednesday : Nothing much happened. Mr Melton sent me on an assignment to go around the VICA classrooms during 6th period for our "Brag sheet". AKA: Awards and acheivements that benson has received over the years. Since 6th period is the time when most Shop teachers aren't around, I was having some trouble finding people to talk to. The only person i could find was Mr Wong. So i told him what I was doing and he was happy to tell me some of the things we have done over the years. In 1983, one of our benson students placed 3rd Nationaly for a drafting compitition. Around the early 90's, someone placed 1st in state or something like that, maybe it was nationals. I'd have to check that damn notepad i was writing things down in. After that, they showed me this new piece of equipment they got that takes drawings from AutoCad, and produces actual models out of them. Mr Wong kept reffering it as "The Electric Microwave", even though one of the Female Architecture teachers was like "IT'S NOT A MICROWAVE". Heh it was funny, they always got in an arguement when ever Wong said "Microwave". Other than that, nothing interesting happened.  Thursday - Nothing interesting happened at all, except the deli. Man that food tastes good.  Friday - Nothing really happened today that was worthy of note, except for the fact i got 3 free Pops for the price of 1. Put a buck into the machine, out came 3 20oz's of Pop. That was cool. Other than that, I got my grades in. I passed CST with a C, :/. At least i passed :)  Man such a dull week. I wish it was interesting like the previous two weeks before it.

      Sigh this week was depressing for the fact that I had finals all the days that I had school. But whatever. Here's what went down  Monday - MLK day. Got to stay home, played some Desert combat and D2 and that's about it.  Tuesday - I had my CST, English and Spanish Finals. CST was a fucking bitch, I didn't even finish it before the time was up, and I couldn't make this one up. To make it even worse, we had two more finals to do in that class the next day. What the hell is this!?!? 3 Finals for one class? Excuse me but that's just bullshit. Anyways, my English final was so easy, I got word today that I got 100% on it. w00t, so I get like 103% in that class. hehe. My Spanish final was a bitch though, although I needed to get a 30% on that test to get a B, "I was slacking off a lot before Winter break, stupid me". I got a 70% without even studying. So I got my B in that class, could have used an A :(.  After school I went to meet Aja and Amanda down at Pioneer place. Man I haven't been there in about 3 years, since they added on that new complex to it, which included the new Theatre. I had some pizza down there that tasted like ass, I'll never go there again :P. After we ate, we just decided to cruise around the place for a bit and go into some of the shops, like sam goody and electronics boutique. We didn't buy anything, just looked around at stuff there. That basically covers Tuesday.  Wednesday - I had to do my 2 damn CST tests. One of them, we had to design an Alarm system. This included 5 parts. Writing a truth table, finding the equation, reducing the equation, making a circuit out of it, then making a more complicated circuit out of it.  ......... I failed that one miserably  The other final was just some binary adition/subtraction/multiplication/divison, converting numbers between hex to binary, decimal to binary, binary to hex, etc... That one was a lot easier :). Except i didnt get to finish both of those Finals. So i had to come in during make up period the next day  After that was my math final. God i hate math. I suck at math. Good bye buisness career :(. At least it was multiple choice so that's always good, made thing's a little easier.  When it was time to go, i decided to head down to Lloyd center to meet Amanda and Aja at the Tilt to play some DDR. "Yeah i made some new friends thanks to Kirk :)". Of course i got out of school at 11:45, and i told them to meet me at 12:45, so i had about an Hour to blow down there before they showed up. I decided to head to the tilt real quick to see what's going on. Of course all the kids i know were playing DDR and playing songs like Legend of Max, which is fucking insane. After they were finished, me and David montgomery played a quick game. We played some easy song, then some hard ass song which i could...... Ahh forget it, i'm starting to nerd on about DDR again. Let's just say i sucked that day and i need to get back in shape.  When the duo got there, we played a few games. Mainly i played some DDR, easy songs of course. I wanted to play some Marvel Vs SNK, but all these asian kids were playing the whole time with just Marvel characters. THEY NEVER USE KICK ASS SNK CHARACTERS. Like Terry. Man, Terry could stomp Ryu any day of the week. So instead of Marvel vs Snk, i played some virtual fighter 4 "Ew", got my ass handed to me by Aja and yeah. That does it for games ..."I AM NOT A FAILIURE :("....  Afterwards, we got some food to eat. I went to this one Indian Cuisine place that's right next to Subway on the food court. Of course, me being an Indian food junkie, i ordered their chicken masalla. Personaly, it was pretty good, but not as good as Swagat downtown makes theirs. But hey, it's a food place in a mall, what can you expect. Aja and Amanda went to Arbys. Personaly, i don't like Arbys, but i haven't gone there for about 5 years so hey, maybe things have changed there.  When we were done eating, we just cruised around the mall for a bit. We went to places like the magic shop downstairs, Spencers "always a classic place", the pet store and Sears. We walked by the one stand that sells Cell phones and Aja always wanted to get a Cell phone. So we hung around there for a while. She wanted to get a flip phone like mine, but we'll have to see what happens next week, she's supposed to go back there and get a deal on a phone with service. That's all that happened that day.  Thursday - My last finals, well i should say "Final". I screwed up on my history final and got a 78%. Damn early 30's. Since i had to wait till make up period to finish my CST finals, i had nothing to do for lunch, except walk around the damn school for 55 minutes. To make it interesting, i walked through every hallway, every corridor, every area inside and outside of the school. Why not eat lunch? I didn't have time to go to Lloyd and back, besides i was broke. After Lunch, i had to finish those damn finals. I got the 3rd CST test done, but on my 2nd one, i didn't trust my circuit, so i had to go with my gut feeling and turn it in.  After school i just came home, watched some TV and then went to ryders house for a bit. We played some Castlevania on his PS2, ate some of his mom's cooking "Not too bad, pretty tasty" and watched Hard boiled, a John woo, Chow yun fat movie with lots of ass kicking and blood being sprayed everywhere. Man that movie was cool. After that i... well.. i basicaly just came home so there you have it

      Well the second week after winter break is over. Nothing exciting happened during the weekdays but what the hell why not say what happened.  Monday - I can't remember worth a damn what i did. Probably nothing important  Tuesday - Same thing, nothing important happened.  Wednesday, Thursday - Nothing important happened that i can remember  Friday - All i can remember was that Mr Melton got us some Big Town Hero sub sandwiches..  Ok. Since i dont know what the hell happened this week. I can make up for it by saying what i know what happened this weekend.  Saturday ------  Well lets see.... NOTHING HAPPENED!!!  No i'm just kidding. A shit load happened saturday At 10:00 i woke up, Had some breakfast and played some games till about 2:00 when i had some lunch. Then i watched some TV for a bit and played games till about 5:00 when i went over to ryders for a bit until me and him had to go to Lloyd center.  Why go to lloyd center at 5:00? Well let me explain  On monday, kirk told me that he was coming down to see some of his friends to take them to see Rocky Horror picture show. I've only seen it once which was back in November, but it was a week after Halloween. This time he wanted to bring me and ryder with him, along with his friends Amanda and Aja, his girlfriend. So he wanted me to meet him and his friends at spencers around 6:30 in lloyd center. He wanted to get ryder to come along too, but knowing ryders Lazy ass, He wouldn't be motivated to really go unless he had a reason. Thankfully i had a $20 i could blow to get me and him tickets to the show and to get us food at lloyd. So i used the old technique of bribing. I got him off his ass and we were off.  So we got there exactly at 6:30.. Thanks to my skillfull bus route skills. "Hooah". Me and ryder met kirk at spencers and he introduced me to his friends. Since it was 6:30 and i hadn't ate since around 2:00, i was pretty damn hungry. So all of us went up to the food court and got ourselves filled. I had some subway and ryder got some Gyros. Kirk and his friends went to that Fiftys diner place which i forget the name of. I currently have a subway addiction so i couldnt resist the temptation >:o. After that, amanda challanged me to a game of DDR. If you know me i couldnt resist so we played a game at the tilt. For someone who was completly new at DDR. Amanda was pimping at the songs we played. I was impressed. Of course, she was playing on beginner, but most people who try DDR on the easiest difficulty usualy end up failing the songs. She never failed a single song.   After we played a game, we decided to head down to aja's apartment, which is somewhere downtown, i don't really recall where. But anywys, we were getting a little roudy, and knowing kirk "From past experiences", he was about to start something that a typical homeless person might do :P. Start singing songs randomly. Thankfully i brought my iPod and beefy headphones. This of course is when everyone notices what i have "Except ryder, he wanted it so he could listen to godsmack instead of Kirk :P", and wants to play with it. Since kirk wanted to make sure that Aja and Amanda's first time at Rocky should be fun, he wanted to get them dressed up. "Cause he's that kind of guy", so we all went to Aja's apartment for a while and Aja got it her outfit for rocky, along with kirk who wore a cloak and a kilt. "I'm not kidding, He wore a cloak and a kilt, nothing else, not even a damn shirt, this being freezing weather" Then agian, ryder was just in pants and a t-shirt and Aja's outfit was basicaly a skirt. I was the only person dressed in warm clothing :P. Such as pants and a t-shirt. "BUT WITH A FLEACE!!!!!". Since everyone was facinated with my iPod, we were listining to random songs on Aja's computer speakers. Most if it was stuff like System of a down and Linkin park. There were a few techno songs but not some of the good ones "In my opinion". After they got their costumes together, i decided i wanted to do something. Amanda wanted to put me in a skirt but i'm not into Drag :P. They begged and begged but i resisted!!! They then asked if they could just dye my hair or something. Since I felt like doing something with my hair, i let her. They dyed my hair purple and for once, my hair looked good.  After we hung out there till about 9:00 PM, we went over to amandas apartment for a while so she could get her costume ready. We sat there, still listeing to the music on my iPod "Only headphones this time ;P" and just basicaly, hung out for a bit. To make everythng cooler, amanda wanted to give us some temp' tattoos. Me and kirk got random viking runes on the backs of our necks and they looked bad ass, until they faded away. When amanda got her costume on, we all headed to the bus to catch the 70 down to transfer to the 4. Now remember, this is at about 11;20 at night, so the busses weren't really running around then. So guess what we did?? We walked about 5 miles total from the 70 bus stop. "If you go to benson, its the one stop where you go to transfer to the 15", down to where you catch the 4 "If you ride the 70 a long ways, it's the one near brick building next to the traintracks", All the way from there to the Theatre where rocky was being shown. Man my feet hurt like hell after that.  When we got inside, it was like a damn Middle School reunion there. THERE WERE 7 PEOPLE FROM MY MIDDLE SCHOOL THERE THAT DAY TOTAL. It scared the shit out of me. They were the following. "Me, Ryder, Kirk --us--, Amanda "Not the one that i met at lloyd", Claire, Matt and Hannah". Just before i entered the theatre, while i was walking to get to my seat i heard a loud "MAX!?". I looked and saw amanda there. Of course my immediate reaction was "WTF!?!?!? Why are you guys here!?". I have never seen so many people i knew at one place, at the same time, at an event that i was going to that day. "Maybe with the exception of seeing Michael Moore, I saw claire there". We all played the "How's it been" game for a while until the movie started which was around 12:00 at night. If you want to know what happens when you see rocky horror, just check out my November post.  When the movie got out around 3:20 AM, my dad told me he would stay up all night to be sure that i got a ride home. Since me and ryder live about 2 blocks away from eachother, and kirk and amanda were staying at Aja's place for the night, me and ryder said our goodbye's to everyone before we left the theater on that very active night.  Man.... Wasn't that an awesome day???  Oh yeah  Sunday - Nothing happened except church :(  Monday - Nothing happened  Very productive wouldn't you say?

      First week after winter break is finaly over. Man this week owned so much. Let's say what happened  Monday - For us in the PPS school district, we had school :(. It was good to get back into some of my classes for a bit. CST was fun because i was ahead of everyone. I got a 87% on my big ass CST quarter 2 test. In english i didnt really do anything. Math, we went over our class test. Lunch, mr melton wasnt there so we didnth have a meeting. Spanish we had new seats and did some class work, History we just sat around and read out of the book. That was it  Tuesday - Someone answered my prayers and brought the PPS district a snow day!!!! That was awesome. I mainly just sat around and home and played games  Wednesday- Someone answered my prayers again and brought us ANOTHER snow day. This time my friend Ryder came over and we did some stuff at my house.  Thursday - SOMEONE ANSWERED MY PRAYERS AGAIN!!!!! ANOTHER SNOW DAY!!!! Man this was cool. This time i went over to ryders house, listened to some Queen "Best band ever", and i helped him with SC. Then we walked all the way from his house up to Subway and had some sandwiches. Man, subway = WIN. Then we went back to my house and played some Diablo 2.  Friday - Holy shit, could it get any better? ANOTHER SNOW DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Basicaly today i went to kaiser to get some medication for this damn skin condition i have. Grrrr, then we went to the PC club to check on my RAM to see if i can use it yet. They still dont have the mother board to test it with!!! Damnit i need that RAM. So far that's all that's happened during this first week of 2004. I hope there's more kick ass weeks to come, this year owns so far.

      Happy Friggin New-Year  I'm writing this at 1:13 in the morning. Welcome 2004, good riddence 2003. The real reason i haven't updated since i got out of school is this. I didn't want to and..... well, i didn't want to. Mostly because all i did was stay at home and do nothing, save going to places to get people gifts. Lets say what i got for my parents. For my mom, i got her a hot wheels mini-cooper, because she wants a mini cooper, but since i cant afford one, i gave her the best one that i could afford. For my dad i gave him the chocolat Dvd. Yeah im cheep so what.  Anyways. For christmas, i got 2 new sticks of RAM and a new HD. After putting those in, i got myself a new motherboard for christmas, if you can guess where i just went with that :P. I also got a cell phone, which in these times, is something you really need. Other then that i got the Pirates Of The Carabean DVD "I probably mispelled that", some clothes and a $50 gift card to EB, where with some christmas money, i bought Max Payne 1 and 2 for PC. After that i went to dinner at my uncles house with my dad and grandparents. We had some dry turkey but hey, food is food  After christmas, me and my dad went down to my Cousin Sallys house in Kingston, which is a town 7 Miles off the coast of seattle if you travel from seattle to kingston VIA the ferry. She had a nice place, the town was pretty small and i got to go see the Lord of the rings, return of the king. That movie was pretty kick ass. Also got to play with my phone down there for a while.  For the rest of the week, it's been pretty dull, except for the fact that we've had some major snow for the past few days. Some of the best snow i've seen in a long time. I was amazed when i first saw how much of it there was. I was rebuilding my PC around 7:00 PM yesterday and there was hardly any snow on the ground, but when an hour passed by, the ground was covered in so much snow, it shocked me and made me happy because i haven't seen that much snow in portland since 1996.  So as winter break winds down to a close, i guess i'd have to say that this years winter break was a pretty enjoyable one. We actualy had snow!!!! Anyways, i'd better get some sleep. Happy new year everyone!

      WOOHOOO LEAP DAY!!!!!!!!! Next one comes when i'm 20!  Bleh this day was so-so, i admit it was really fun, but most of the time well.... you'll get the picture  Today infact was sunday: I did the usual routine: Wake up, get dressed, get a quick drink and go off to church. When i got to church i did the usual church thing: Talk to people, sneak around in the kitchen for food and then i went off to child care to look at the babys. That was basicaly all i did during the church routine today.  Amanda had told me about Ryder and Aja going out the other day, so I was like "I actually made a difference in someones life! :)" But then again at the same time, i felt a little sad because first off, i was able to get one of my best friends a Girl friend and yet, sigh, here I am with no one. Let alone the fact that I really like Aja and well... bah... forget it... I guess it's just a screwed up case of Success and Jelousy or something like that, i don't really have an idea. I just need a Girl friend or someone who really cares about me that is.  Around 1:30, me and ryder decided to go spend the day with Aja and Amanda and show them Full Metal Jacket, one of the best movies i've seen in my life. When we got there, Aja opened the door for us, because only Apartment tennants can open the door. We went up to her place and hung out for a bit, Amanda was still at work so we decided to wait for her to get off work before we would start the movie. But Amanda called a little bit later and said that she wanted to meet us at the airport for no particular reason. We all didn't want to go but i mean, considering what Amanda was going through lately, i guess we couldnt resist. "The main reason being, she lost her grandma a few days ago, and as of today, her other grandma died". So we left the apartment around 3:00 and took the MAX down the the airport. Aja and Ryder looked like they were having a good time and I just sat there, happy, and at the same time, depressed but oh well.   We got the Airport around 4:00. We spent about a half hour looking for Amanda before we finaly met her at Powells books inside the terminal. Since we all hadn't really had anything to eat all day, we all decided that we should get some supplies for dinner because it was getting kind of late. So we took the MAX down to the closest fred meyers and got some supplies to make some big sub sandwiches. We all bought the neccessary goods and headed back to Aja's apartment.  When we got there, amanda started to work on the food and the rest of us just hung around. Most of the time Aja and Ryder were just laying in eachothers laps talking about random things and I was just sitting there trying to get an idea of what to do. Don't feel bad for me or anything if you're getting the vibe i wasnt involved in any conversations or anything today, trust me, i was a lot involved, but... bleh forget it. Anyways, we ate and watched the Movie. Aja's uncle brian decided to stop by because he was in town, so we got to meet her uncle. He seemed like a cool guy, but Aja said he wasn't really the best person in the world, but she loved him to death, something along those lines.  Anyways, since we got to her apartment at 6:00, and we had to be home around 9:00, and the movie got over around 8:10ish, we decided that we had to go. Ryder, of course being a person in that position, didn't want to go home "Don't blame him", but Aja insisted because she didnt want our parents mad at us. So me and Ryder decided to end the day and now today is almost over.   Time to get some sleep. :(

      Huzzah! School's almost out for the week.  Monday: I left home at 7:30 in the morning and got home at 9:00. Why so late? Because of all the shit i had to go to. I had to go to my math tutor at 4:30 which is at PSU, so if i went home and back, i wouldnt make it back in time. So i had to go directly to PSU after school and find something to do there for an hour. When it came time, i did get some help with math, which is of course why i got a tutor. After that, i went and got some pizzacotto pizza across the street from PSU, then headed off to Benson again for Nightschool. So that was a long ass day  Tuesday: Didn't really do much of anything tuesday, except for the fact that we had a late opening, so i came early as usual. Mr Melton wasnt here so basicaly i wondered the school looking for something to do. I spotted david so i followed him to the new web team room, which is basicaly been downgraded to Mr. Bennets room because the school took away the webteam room and gave it all to the yearbook team or something like that, i don't really know. Haha sucks for them :P. Anyways. I mostly just hung out with mark. He was doing some stuff online, listening to music, the usual stuff. We tried to play some scortched earth but it wasnt working at all. So mark being extremely occupied with life, decided to waste 20 minutes of his life playing number munchers at the 3rd grade level, probably because that's the height of his math knowledge :P. Other then that, we just had the usual late opening schedule.    Wednesday: Nothing really much happened wednesday, just sat around doing school work at school, got home, played games, talked online, fairly bland day i would say. Other then that, after school, i had to go to church at 7:00 at night to serve for the Ash Wednesday service that i really didnt want to be in, but i stupidly signed up for it anways. Such is the way of life sometimes :(   Thursday: The day started off as usual like every day does for me. I woke up, had breakfast, got dressed, went to school etc.... Fairly boring day except for the evening. I was going to meet Amanda, Aja and Ryder down at Lloyd Center for a while and just hang out. Aja met me around 4:00 and we just walked around for an hour around the mall talking about things. Then we met Amanda up at the food court around 5:00. Talked for stuff, ate some dinner, then ryder came a few minutes later. After that, we really didnt do much except walk around the mall till about 8:00. We basicaly just talked about stuff and yeah.... Just hung out that's all i guess.  Friday: We had an assembly about MLK and African awareness, or some shit like that. People read some poerty, did some skits, talked about famous black inventers, crap like that. Most of the time it was pretty boring, save the Mime skit. Other then that i hate my CST teacher, but thanks to the assembly i got out of CST at 9:42. KICK ASS. We also had another Fuse die... But i'll explain that later  It's almost time for the period to end, so i have to wrap this up short.... Later

      Bleh, i was too tired sunday to really do an entry. I tried and this is what i came up with yesterday... so basicaly, i wrote all of this sunday right when i got home. ______________________________________________________________________ Phew, just got back from the mountain for the weekend.  The following parts of my body i can not feel or hurt like crazy 1.) My Arms 2.) My Legs 3.) My Ass  Onward with the post!!!  Friday - Had lunch at Mr meltons room. He forgot to order the pizza and instead got 3 Big Town Hero subs. I was so damn hungry that i ate the equivalent of one of those big sandwitches. The meeting was just about how we should manage our articles in the future but most of the time i was concentrating on eating.  I got out of school around the usual 3:00. Jennifer picked me up at the parking lot at the bank across the school. We headed off to Trinity Cathedral to meet everyone else that was going on the trip. The only people going from my church was Me and my friend Olivia. People that were from trinity were Nicko "Don't know if that's his actual name", Kathrine, Ryan, Austin, Dan, John, and some dude which i never got the name of. And of course there were the chaperones but yeah, let's just get on with what happened during the weekend that was cool.  Before we all headed out twards the mountian, me, Jennifer and Olivia left the cathedral to pick up food for breakfast that was going to be used for the next 2 days at some Grocery store downtown. We got the usual supplies. Pancakes, milk, eggs, cereal, just basic breakfast equipment. After that it was a 4 hour trip to the mountain  We left the parking lot around 4:30 and arrived at the lodge around 10:30 because of all the traffic that we were in. Olivia had lost her cell phone in Washington D.C. So for some reason, since everyone likes the technology i always carry with me, she wanted to play around with my phone. She messed around with it a bit and put stupid stuff in my schedule "Like just now actualy, i got an alert saying 'Happy sunday' on my planner. tsk tsk. Girls will be girls i guess"  Anyways back on track  We got to the lodge and unpacked our stuff. Us guys were allowed to sleep anywhere in the lodge, and the girls were confined to one room. I was lucky enough to claim one of the couches before anyone even noticed them. Damn good thing too because that couch was extremely comfertable.  After we got all unpacked, we decided to check out what was in this lodge that we were staying in. They had a pool table with a TV in one room, 3 bedroom with TV's, 4 bathrooms and a Hot Tub outside, which i never knew about so i didnt pack any trunks. But man 4 bathrooms for a 1 story house. I could use just another one at my house!!!!!!!  Me, Jenn and Olivia were the last ones to arrive at the house, when we got there, everyone was in the recc' room watching TV and/or playing pool. I played a few games of pool with some of the people there, mainly Nicko and Ryan. As i mentioned they had a hot tub availible to use, so all of the crew from trinity decided to dawn their trowsers and jump in the hot tub. Of course the heat control was no where to be found so they were all baking in 120 degrees of hot water. Sounds like fun. I didn't go in because as i said, i didn't really expect a hot tub to be there. Anyways, the rest of the night was just to get outselves situated for a good nights sleep.  TRANSISTION TO SATURDAY  Saturday - We all woke up around 7:00. I didn't really get much sleep so i was super tired. We all got some breakfast together, mainly it was just pancakes and eggs. I just had one pancake because i wasnt too hungry...  -Now to finish this entry-  ______________________________________________________________________ Around 8:00, the person in charge decided to grab us all together and ask us what our plan was going to be for the whole day. Me, austin, olivia, ryan, dan and john all wanted to go snowboarding. Of course i did NOT have ANY money what-so-ever to rent a snowboard, let alone even get a lift ticket, Jennifer "Being so kick ass, as always" said she could cover me for both. My god i love that woman sometimes. So i was about to go snowboarding for the first time in my entire life!!   We left the lodge around 9:30ish and got to Mt. Batchlor around 10:05 or something like that. Olivia had brought her own snowboard so all she needed was just a lift ticket. Me and everyone else had to go and get ourselves some boots and a board. The board that i rented was a stomp-lock mechanism...type....thing.... which pissed me off a lot, but that will be explained later.  It was very sunny outside on the mountain when we emerged with our boards in hand. Since i was a complete virgin to snowboarding, Dan also being completely new to snowboarding, Jennifer decided to give us a few pointers on how to snowboard. She taught us the main methods of stopping while going down the snow, how to turn and basicly how to slow down. Just the very basics, not a full on fledged lesson or anything, but just some tips. After about a half hour of practicing, it was time to test our skills out on the slopes  And here is where the parts about my ass hurting come into play....  We all decided to just go up the ski-lift for the Bunny Hill slope first, because we were after all, beginners. When we got to the top of the slope, of course me being new i fell off the lift, which is to be expected :P, but i made it back up ok. With the pointers in my mind that Jennifer had given me, i felt like i could be badass on the slope like i was in Coolboarders 3 on the Playstation.  The pros make everything look so easy, i hate it when i feel like i can do what they can do.  Right off the bat i was going like 60mph downhill, which for me was awesome, but the problem was i wasn't the master of slowing down, let alone stopping yet. So the first attempt to stop made me do a backwards summersalt once, then a regular summersalt, then a flip onto my ass which hurt like nothing else in my life had hurt ever before. IT KICKED ASS!!!!!!!! But you know what they say, no pain no gain.  Of course it didnt stop there, i went up the bunny slope about 6 more times trying to improve on my own without any help. I actualy got slowing down, stoping and turning down pretty damn good. So i felt pretty confident about myself to be able to go up to a Green difficulty hill with austin and ryan, with me and dan being the newbies.  I HATE BEING A n00b!!!!!!!!!  Of course, never do what people tell n00bs to do. As in, follow them up.   The slope was insane. There were like vertical drops left and right everwhere. I was scared out of my fucking mind. They were like "Oh come on it's easy". EASY MY ASSHOLE!!!! I had a hard time trying to get up from falling 40 times on that damn slope. Hell, i didnt even ride down the slope, i just went down with my board horrizontal to the slope while looking forward, so i basicaly went down it slowly while looking like a retard. But in the end, i actually did make it down sucessfuly. So kudos to me for that.  When we got down to the bottom, me and austin took a wrong turn and ended up at sunshine lodge instead of lodge where we originaly started out at. So we had to call someone "Thank god for my cell phone" and get a ride back to the lodge where we started at.  Doing that ment that i had about 10 minutes to kill sitting around. So me and austin just sat there and talked for a bit. Holy shit, man me and this guy had so much in common it wasnt funny. Let's state the facts.  1.) We both have iPods 2.) We both went to the same middle school 3.) We're milkaholics 4.) Both our moms drag us to church against our will 5.) We both got baptised around 12  Hell, add to the fact that he used to date the daughter of the guy who owned the circle store on ladds addition, and you got yourself an interesting character. Hell, i didn't know Tab "The owner of the now, unexistant circle store :(" had a daughter. So that's kick ass. after we learned some stuff about each other, our ride came and we all went back to the lodge.  When we got back to the lodge "The one where our sleeping stuff is, not the ski lodge" we all put our clothes in the wash and just chilled for a while. Mainly all i did was play some pool, watch tv and eat some food and just plain hang out. Of course, since we just got back from the slopes, each of us was like. "It's cold" "HOT TUB TIME!!!!!!!". Of course i neglected to bring any sort of trunks so i was left out :(. "BUT WHY NOT WEAR SOME PANTS OR SOMETHING!?!?!?!?" because well, most of those weren't ment to be soaked in water. So everyone partied out in the hot tub and i stayed inside. Around 7:30, Katherine and Dan came out of the hot tub to get drinks for everyone because they lost some sort f race in the snow. So i got to see Katherine in a bikini. Man, she had the hottest body i've seen in a while, add to the fact she was in a bikini in winter and oh man. It was an awesome moment for me. After the hot tub party, we had a mini comunion service, which included bread and wine "SCORE". Then we all decided to go to bed around 12:00 and that was the end of saturday  Sunday: Woke up around 7:30. Got breakfast, had some DAMN good coffee cake that katherine's mom made, then we went back up to the mountain to go inner tubbing. Nicko and Dan payed for me because as i said, i didn't really have any money to spare to do anything. So that proves that there were awesome people up there that will pay for you even if you've only known them for a day.  Tubing was fun as hell. Of course the Mt.Batchlor tubing park is lame, as in there's no bumps, its just about 7 lanes of going straight down with some slight drops. The first 3 runs i just went by myself. To make it fun, we all divided into teams of two and raced eachother. As in, we went in a lane with a partner. We would grab onto eachothers tubs and just let it go. We used up 3 lanes total every time. Man, everytime i went with someone we always lost. I never got why. Maybe it was because my long ass legs were creating lots of air resistance or something. Most of the time, it was me and Dan on one team.  Haha oh yeah, we always had a war with Katherine and Olivia. We would always try to mess up their start by either tackeling them or just pushing their tubes down the slope while running back and going down our tubes. Of course we got into many snowball fights. It was a very fun day i would say :D. On our last run, we decided to be so illegal that we would all take up one lane and just all go down at once. We succedded at getting 4 people going down at once, but me and ryan were stopped before we had a chance. It was pretty funny. Some lady said not to do it again or we would get the wire clippers!!!! Of course i don't know what the hell she ment by that but it sparked some sort of inside joke that i'm now a part of.  At 12:00, we all got in our cars and headed off to the Sun river lodge to get some lunch. They had some good food there. After lunch, we went back to the lodge to pack up our stuff and head back to portland :(. I DIDNT WANT TO LEAVE :( :( :(. But what has to happen, had to happen. So we left around 3:00 and got home around 7:30  There's the weekend. It took me 3 days to write this because i kept running out of energy or just didnt want to type anymore.

      Bleh. Once again this week was very dull. I dont know what to really say for what happened this week. As usuall i did jack crap during the weekdays. Umm lets see.  Monday - We had no school thanks to the 4 day weekend we got here in the PPS School district. Mostly i just chilled out at my house. Went to PSU to get a tutor for math because i suck ass at math.  Tuesday - First day back at school. I knocked out a Lab in my CST class, had some rice for lunch, had my first session of Chemistry nightschool for the 2nd semester.   Wednesday - Had more rice for lunch. Um, didnt really do much of anything interesting.  Thursday ::Today:: - I got my DOS computer in CST. Installed DOS on it, and now well, i can play with DOS on my 2nd computer. Horray!!! I had rice for lunch again and so far that's where i am now. Sitting here, typing this trying to think of something interesting to say. But alas, I have failed. Maybe something cool will happen 7th and/or 8th period and/or when i get home.   Anyways, tomorow through Sunday, i'll be out at Mt. Batchlor. I'm going to hang out with a group from my friends church or something like that. Unfortianatly my parents didn't have enough money to rent me a snowboard. So they just covered the cost for me just hanging out down there. Whatever. That still works. At least i get out of the house for the weekend once again. Man this has been great. Ever since 2004 has come, i've been out of the house for one or both days of the weekend every week. So that's cool. Coming from me, that's kind of weird to say, because usualy i like staying home every day.  Anyways, until then, I guess i'll just do some crap on the internet for the remainder of this period

      Know how i said friday and saturday and sunday remained to be fuffiled? Well i'll just put in what happened the rest of thursday and friday right now.  Thursday- When we last saw our hero, he was typing a small entry from his computer in CST. After that he went to all of his other classes. We pick up during the hero's lunch  For lunch, Mr melton bought some Sub's from Fred Meyers. Of course they were just meat, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. Minus any sort of mayonase or mustard. So we had to look around for some in the fridge. When we had lunch we talked about what was going to be going in the next issue of tech pep, we elected people for their jobs. I'm going to be a reviewer for like games and some music, while also doing some story editing.   After that, i didn't really do anything until i got home around 3:45. Ryder called and wondered what the hell we were going to do on this kick-ass 4 day weekend. I said he could come over. So he did. We listened to his new system of a down CD, played some desert combat and just kicked it. After being bored for a bit, i logged on AIM to see if anyone was on. Aja was on so me and ryder decided to see what was up with her. She told us that she and amanda were going to go down to Lloyd center for a bit around 6:00. Me and Ryder were already bored at my house, so we said that we would join them. We of course got there around 8:00 because the damn bus's took forever. We seemed to wait at least a half hour for the 14 first, then another half hour for the 70.  When we got there, i surprised Aja and she nearly screamed bloody murder "hehehehehe". They were eating some dinner. Me and Ryder had already had something to eat at my house, he had the left over pesto speghetti. Me and my dad had some Spanish Rice.  After they were done eating, we decided to play some games at the Tilt. I bet you can guess what i played :P. Ryder and Aja played some House Of The Dead, "always a good game". Me and amanda played some air hockey and that was it. When it was around 9:00, the mall was starting to close. So we headed out twards the street.  Since we all decided we just wanted to hang out for a bit down at Lloyd, we decided to go our own ways home. Amanda was going to go home by taking the 15, but we all decided to go on the 10 for some reason. I think it was to go to ryders house or something. Anyways, since I had the idea for that, i forgot that the 10 near LLoyd center doesnt go to the Foster Loop at all. So i fucked that up big time, and we ended up going more North instead of South. We asked the bus driver what we were supposed to do to get home. We were supposed to take the 9 down and transfer to some bus or something, i forget. Either way, the only plus of my screwup is that we were near a 7-11, and ryder wanted slurpies, so we all got slurpies thanks to ryder. "SCORE"  After we got ourselves back to where we were originaly, it was about 10:26 when we finaly got back to the bus stop. Of course, the last 70 just went while we were waiting for the 9, it runs till 10:16pm which is pretty lame, even my dad agrees with me. So Aja said we could spend the night at her house. So we all took the Max down to her place. I called my dad to tell him what was up, and i don't know what was wrong but like PMS'd and told me No and that he was going to pick me up at her apartment. Ryder called his mom, and she said it was ok to spend the night there. Of course i tried convincing my dad that I could save him the ride down to pick me up, since it was pretty late. But nope, he wanted me to come home. So ryder got to spend the night with Aja and Amanda, "TWO GIRLS", and i got to go home. How queer.  Friday - Today - I woke up around 10:00am, played some games, had something to drink and watched some TV for like 20 minutes. Since i was a little depressed because of how last night ended, I called Aja to see what was up. Ryder was still there and Amanda had gone out to work. I asked what was up and of course, they had just woken up. They said i could go over and hang out with them. Of course that would mean spending an hour on the bus. But what the hell!! I wasn't doing anything creative. So i decided to go all the way downtown and hang out with them. Of course this time, the bus' and the Max were kind to me. I got to the 14 stop just in time before it left. When i got to the 70 stop, the 70 was just a block away, when i got to the max stop, the Max was about 200 feet away. So overall i waited a total for 5 minutes for everthing this time instead of an Hour. Kick ass!  I got there about 12:00 or something like that. I got up there and they were just sitting around talking about stuff. We didn't really do much of anything there except talk about things. Since we were hungry, we needed to get some breakfast. So we had subway for breakfast, which always kicks ass :D. Then we went to Fred Meyers so Aja could pick up some food for her apartment. After that we went back to her apartment and just hung out, for like 4 hours. We mainly just talked about random things. Ryder and Aja seemed to be getting a thing on "awwwww :)", so it was kind of cute when they both of them started to play fight with eachother. I could go into more detail but nah, i'd like to keep you all in suspense :P.   When it was 4:00, Aja had to go and clean her apartment for her friend Robert that was coming down from Medford to visit her. She also had to go to city hall to get some parking permits, so basicaly it was time for me and Ryder to go.  Me and ryder took my bus route back home. So we got home around 4:30. We were hella tired, thanks to that slurpee from last night. Damn thing is overloaded with sugar or something, i dont know.   Anyways that covers thursday and friday more clearly

      Yet another boring week, but yet another exciting weekend. Why not discuss what the hell is going on my life once again. Instead of the usual recap, i'll just say that Monday - Friday consisted of absoultly nothing interesting. So we'll just jump to saturday  Saturday - Friday was ryders birthday. Now he's 17 and can go see Rated R movies. Still no permit, of course he say's he's never going to drive later on in his life but i know he will. Anyways, for his birthday, me, him and his friend Brian all went to the Avalon around 5:00. He called me around 4:45 right after i got my haircut, i burned him a CD for his present, went to his house and just chilled till Brian got off work. When he got there we got one of Ryder's moms friends to drive us down to the avalon because it being the weekend, the bus's don't run so often. Unfortianatly we rode in a pickup, so 2 of us had to ride in the canopy. Me and Brian were the candidates so we just chilled out in the back, talked about life, what's going on, stuff about school, you know, the usual stuff.  When we got to the avalon, we did what we usualy do. Play games. We played games from about 6:00 till about 8:30. Games like DDR, Ninja Assault and some other shooters like Jurrasic park 3. For me there wasn't much of a variety, i just mainly played the ticket games. That sums up the Avalon trip  After the avalon, we went to get some food, because we really didn't have anything to eat before we headed out. So we went to It's a Beautiful pizza which is down on belmont. Pizza there was pretty kick ass. But there's really nothing important about this subject, we were just hungry.  Ryder was actualy smart and remembered to bring his powells books gift cirtificate. Because we were on our way to fred meyers to get some food, we passed by powels and ryder wanted to look around for a bit. So we did, even though i thought it would be like for 20 minutes, but it turned into an hour and a half of looking at books. Me being ignorant, i didn't know what to look at in regards to books because i don't really read things too often. But jesus, everytime i looked at a book, Ryder and Brian would be like "Yeah that was a pretty good book" Or "Man that book was a piece of shit" or "Man this cover art is awesome".  ...............Yeah i need to start reading books more often  Finaly ryder bought 3 hardback books with his giftcard and Brian bought a book with his own money, and of course me being ignorant, i didn't buy anything.  FINALY after an hour and a half of being in a book store "My parents are the same way like that sometimes" we finaly went to fred meyers to pickup some drinks. While we were there, aja called me on my cellphone to find out what was up. I told her what we were doing earlier in the day and that we were a little sad her and amanda weren't there, because they were supposed to be at a party the same time we were going to the avalon, but in the end they didnt go. "Grr". After that ryder wanted me to say hi to them for him but aja was like "Lemme talk to him". So i gave ryder my phone and he talked to her for like 20 minutes. Hehe. Me and brian were talking shit to him the entire time he was on the phone. I would try to explain why but, it was one of those "You had to be there" situations. After that, Aja and amanda always bring up the subject of "When are we gunna hang out together again". Personaly i have nothing against hanging out with people, it's just i was planning to do my big ass spanish assignment on suday but what ever, i could use an excuse to get out of the house for another day, so we decided we would meet them tomorow at lloyd near subway on the 3rd floor and after that we would go to the avalon.   After that, since it was about 10:00 pm, we decided to go back to ryders house. We bought a 12 pack of cherry coke and a 20oz of Squirt ruby red. At the 14 bus stop, the one near indian oven where all the hippies hang out, one of the dudes asked if i did mushrooms. Of course i never do drugs AT ALL... "Maybe if i get into college...." so i said no and he polietly went away. When we got on the bus, the bag with the 12 pack of coke basicaly exploded and all the cokes fell onto the floor of the bus, which was hella lame because it made me look like a dumbass. So i just took all the cokes and put them in the plastic bag.   When we got to ryders house, there wasn't really anything to do. So we just hung out and played some card games and ate some cake. Brian said we could spend the night at his house if we wanted to so in the end we did. I wanted to spend the night at someones house because i didn't want to go to church tomorow. The main reason for this is because im sick to death of people asking me to do shit for others because they didn't show up in time, or they didn't show up at all. I've had to acolyte like 3 fucking times in a row because no one wanted to show up. So i just let them deal with me not showing up this time. Hahaha, bitches. Anyways thats my church rant, on with brians house  We got to his house around midnight, his mom picked us up. His house is pretty small, but it's not bad. His room is pimp shit though. He has an xBox, a PS2 and a gamecube. Along with a TV with a DVD player with surround sound. Because we were bored and didn't want to go to sleep "Speaking of sleep, Brian had been up for at least a week without sleep, he wont tell us why and i don't think i will inquire", we decided to play some random Gamecube game. He pulled out Mario Cart for the GC. Jesus, man this version was awesome. Of course i sucked ass at it but i mean it was hella fun. I could go into detail but i'm trying to do this entry as fast as i can because frankly i've got a lot more to go.  We did that till like 3:00 in the morning. After that we just listened to some music like Linkin Park. We listened to Meteora all the way through till like 3:30. Then we talked about shit while we tried to go to sleep, even though i guess im more of a nocternal person because i wasn't tired at all. Then at about 3:45 it all died down and we tried to sleep. I had a hard time because it was hard trying to find a comfertable position sleeping on the floor. It took me until like 4:30 before i actually went to sleep "I might be exaturating on that but i didn't know what time it was when i actualy went to sleep" I had an awesome dream that i burned down the school. Man that was kick ass, too bad it wont happen.   --TRANSITION TO THE NEXT DAY--  Sunday - We woke up around 11:00.. Well, ok we didnt wake up then. We all woke up around 8:30 but i mean, we just didnt get up until about 11:00 when Brians dad came in and told him he was off to work. For breakfast, we each had a cherry coke "How kickass is that?" and that's it for breakfast. Brians girlfriend called him on his cellphone so he talked to her until like 12:30. I can understand how conversations like that can last so damn long so i'm not bitching. So after he hung up, we decided to head back to ryders real quick so he can have a shower. While we were there, Brian was bored, so he poped in the old old OLD, Super mario brothers into the NES. The tightest thing though, he beat it in about 15 minutes. That's pretty tight because that game is hard as hell, although if you knew Brian, he's the god of console games. After that we just headed to my house so i could get a quick bite to eat then we headed off to Lloyd to meet Amanda and Aja.  When we got there at 2:00 EXACTLY "Man twice in a row i've met people at a place at the exact time we are supposed to meet" Amanda saw us near the subway on the 3rd floor. We actually dragged Brian along with us because i think he didn't really have anything planned today. Aja was downstairs on the first floor so Amanda had to go and get her. After we all got together, we all got some lunch, except for me, i just had a Mango Lassi. We all ate, talked about how life is going on, then we all headed to the Avalon.  Okay the Avalon. Basicaly what i said before about our trip yesterday, basically happened today also. We played a few games like DDR, some racing game, and Virtual ON. Ryder and Brian played Ninja Assault and beat it, spending about $4.00 in nickles on that game. Man i guess it was hard as hell. I played the one star wars game and beat it all. Other then that, i added like 3 more chains to my, what i call, wonderland chain.  At 5:00 we decided to call it a day, Me and ryder and Brian all took  the 14 to our own homes and Aja and amanda took the 15.   Since i've barely had any sleep, i'm tired as hell and cranky as hell, "If you couldn't determine that from the way im writing now". I think i'll wrap this entry up by saying this  My hands hurt from typing and i need some sleep  HAIL SATAN

      Well, spring break is almost over unfortunatly, so let's tell everyone what i did.  Monday - Monday, i stayed at home all day because i really had no where to go. So most of the day was spent playing Starcraft or Soldat or Americas army. Otherwise i was just Chatting on AIM most of the time. So monday was the most dull day of the week.  Tuesday - At 3:00 i left for a LAN party that Sean had invited me to go to. Took my computer and everything except my speakers along with me. When i got there, everyone was playing CS or Halo. Me being stupid, i didn't bring my damn Half Life CD or the CD key, so i couldnt play CS the entire time there. So that was lame. For the time being, i just played Soldat online. Around 7:00, Ben, Mark and Sean came from a party they were at, so once they all set up their computers, we all installed Battlefield vietnam and decided to give it a test. In our opinion, it's a lot better then regular battlefield, especially the fact that choppers are easy to fly then the ones in desert combat are. Also you can pick up tanks and drop them in a helicopter, that's so hardcore in my opinion. But some of the guns are overpowered, like the M60 for example. You can waste people so easily with that gun it's kind of cheap. But overall the game is kick ass.  After some battlefield, we all decided to play a big ass game of Starcraft which was extremely bad ass. 8 people game FFA, which in the end turned out to be a 4v2 game, where the 2 people being Sam and Sean. They killed us because everyone on our team was a bunch of n00bs. But whatever, it happens. At 9:00, we were all hungry, so we all decided to go get some taco bell to eat. Taco bell is a block away from Sam's house, so that was convienent. I stocked up on Hot Sauce because Taco Bell's hot sauce is PWNAGE!!!!!!!! I love their hot sauce so much, hell i ate it straight the whole lan party, its my secret for not falling asleep. When it was 2:00, and when we were tired of playing games, i decided to go to bed.   Wednesday - The next day, we got up, most people were playing either CS or Halo.  Pat's a CS loser who kept begging everyone to play CS every 5 minutes. But only like 4 people out of 13 were always playing CS. After a while, we played some more Battlefield vietnam for a while, i owned everyone with my flying skills with my joystick and kicked some ass. After that, another game of starcraft, then we played some Call Of Duty for a while and then we went to Taco Bell again. When we got back, Ben said we should all play some Savage, which is a combination of a RTS/FPS. It's pretty damn tight though, although it was screwing up on my computer badly because i didn't have my motherboard drivers installed yet. So that sucked. After Savage, we played another game of SC, This time i was on the winning team. After that, More COD, then some more battlefield, another game of Savage and then some more Taco Bell. Then we got back, we decided to load up Quake 3 and play some Urban Terror, which is the most bad ass Mod for quake 3 ever made, besides Bid For Power, which is a DBZ mod. I of course pimp so much at urban terror, no one could stop me. Every time we played, i got first place out of like 10 people that played, so yeah i kick ass.  After urban terror, we played some BFP, Sean was always chasing me around trying to kill me but i kept repelling him with my hand beam of doom. After that, it was about 2:00 in the morning once again, so we decided to go to bed once again.  Thursday - Woke up, played a big game of savage, then went to Taco Bell, restocked on Hot Sauce, came back, played some more CoD, then some more Vietnam, Then another game of SC where i was with Sean and Sam and Josh. Sam fucked up our base real bad at the start so we lost that game because we were playing Team Melee. So that was bad. After that, we played some more urban terror, some more savage, some more Vietnam, by the time it got to 5:30, we all had to go home, so that was lame. I smashed my finger like crazy getting in my moms car, that it still hurts like a bitch up till now. So that sucks. When i got home. I went online, checked email, played soldat with john and went to bed.  Friday - Just woke up, its 12:16, gotta find something to do for the rest of the day, who knows? I might go to stuff and get a 19" monitor today. But most likely not, we'll just see how the day goes on.

      Yes bitches!! It's spring break finaly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO SCHOOL FOR A WEEK AHHHHHH I need this break so damn much you have no idea.  Lets do the weekly recap starting from sunday because i feel like it  Sunday - Went to church, did child care and ate food/talked to friends. That was mainly what i did in the morning. During the afternoon, i went with Amanda and Ryder and his girlfriend down to Saturday Market to just hang out. Me and Ryder got there a half hour early so we checked out Saturday market for about a half hour. I haven't been back there for about 6 years, me and my mom used to go occasionaly, but i haven't had a real interest of going back down there for a while.  When Aja and Amanda came down, we all decided to just cruise the place for about an hour or so just looking at the various booths. Nothing really interesting happened, nothing was bought, we just hung out. After that we went to Lloyd Center and just hung out for a bit, played some DDR. I saw Kyle there, a dude i met at Mac camp about say, 6 years ago. He's more hardcore at DDR then i am, i could go nerding around about DDR some more but for the sake of keeping this short, i wont. Me and him talked about how our lives have been, he said he's now part of the stepmania team "The group of people who make a DDR emulator for PC", so that's bad ass. Other then that, i went home and yeah.  Monday - School started off yet again, people were still rebuilding their PC's, so that was boring, cause i had nothing to do first and second period. I went with matt to Mr Davis's room and got a testboard to check the ram, and it killed the testboard. So we had to get new RAM for matt. Other than that, the rest of the day was just, Bleh.  Tuesday - Long ass day yet again. The usual. School, PSU, Night School, BORING  Wednesday - Nothing really cool happened, just face it, nothing ever interesting happens during the week  Thursday - Nothing interesting happened that day, except we finaly started learning C++ in CST, other than that, I just had massive Soldat action late at night. oh wait, we released the latest edition of tech pep that day in school. Worst issue ever according to Devin. But i would have to dissagree in some regards.  Friday - Had free lunch during the tech pep meeting during lunch. Big Town Hero sandwiches, Chips and of course the usual assortment of drinks. So that was cool. Other than that, i got out of school FOR SPRING BREAK. KICK ASS  SPRING BREAK TIME BITCHES!!!!!!!! Now i gotta find something to do. Aja's going back to medford, Ryders goin camping with a few friends. Only thing i have planned so far is "MAYBE" going to a LAN party from Tuesday through Thursday. My dad said something about a trip to the beach maybe, but i'm not sure about that. I'll just have to see.

      School once again is almost over, guess i should wrap this boring week up once again  Monday - Dont really remember much of anything, except for the fact that uh, yeah, nothing terribly interesting happened. All i know is that i went to school then home. yeah....  Tuesday - Late opening, got to school around 9:00 because i wanted to go early to finish some work or something, i dont really remember. After school, went down to PSU for math tutoring, then back to Benson for Nightschool. So i left at 9:00 am, and came back around 9:00 PM! Yeah it was another long ass day.  Wednesday - Got to school and knocked out Lap 10 "not lab, it's lap for these DOS laps" in my CST class. So i got to start on the fun task of taking apart my DOS machine and putting it back together. I took apart the whole computer in the 2 periods that we had, and almost had it rebuilt, except for the fact that the computer's monitor wouldnt turn on because there as a lose IDE cable inside the case. Also, i got a mad scratch while i was trying to put the Floppy drive back into the computer, so there was blood everywhere and it was hardcore, because blood is aweome. Also because the sun was starting to show its face around this time of year, i decided to bring my kick ass sunglasses with me that i bought in Mexico. Other than that, when i got home, Ryder was out with Aja and Amanda helping Amanda move into Aja's apartment because she's going to be her new roommate. Man i could have used going over there to help because i had absolutly nothing to do at my place the whole day, but nobody told me anything until about 11:00pm. So that was lame.  Thursday - Lets see, another lame day. Didn't really do much of anything thats interesting. Went to school, learned some stuff, had lunch, talked with people, went home, did email, played games. Yep, just your average typical day. Except for the fact i downloaded the new version of Soldat. It's a pretty fun game, especially when you have a 3v3 game going on. Yep, that covers thursday. Oh wait, i changed the IDE cable in my DOS machine and it booted, so i was happy about that. Took the whole thing apart, put it back together, and it worked. That happens rarely for me.  Friday - Got to school, had fun during CST laughing at David, Nick and Matt who weren't finished putting their computer back together, actually, nick hasnt even started on his computer yet, so he gets more laughs at him. David finished putting his back together today, and Matt is still in the process of putting his back together. He almost got it together, except he has some bad RAM problems. He might have killed his motherboard because Matts a n00b at taking apart PC's. So i laugh at him  When Diss was gone from the class room. Me and Nick got bored, so we tried to find something to do. We found a bottle of half empty Sprite, so we decided to throw it around the room at eachother. Then we had an idea, since Diss was gone from the classroom for an extended period of time, like he does every day, we just kept throwing it back and forth for like 5 minutes. Then we all decided to record it on the webcam. It was a pretty hardcore game of catch. Next monday, next time when diss leaves, i want to play a game of "Hit the webcam". I know that sounds extremely stupid but i have no work to do in that class until everyone is caught up. "LET NICK CATCH UP THEN" uh huh, like he'll do the damn work anyways :P  Anyways, this weekend i'm probably off to johns house. Other than that i dont know. So there you go, this week in a nutshell once again.

      Another week gone by, school out for the weekend, the never ending question of what im going to do..... Well, we can always think of that later.  Monday - Just had the usual day of school, nothing really interesting, except for the fact that we might be moving out CST class room to the Semi Conductor Training room which has been abandoned for about 10 years. Currently it's being used as a storage room for all these electronic devices not being used, such as like 50 unopened webcams, and like 40 DVD players. While we were checking out the room, all of us decided to jack a webcam for ourselves. If you haven't noticed, the picture next to the right was taken with the webcam. So now all you ladies can see how sexy i am in real life. Of course we haven't started to move yet, and we might not even move at all. But the good part of that day was that i got a free webcam. w00t! That was the main highlight of the day.  Tuesday - Another long ass day where i didnt get home till about 9:00 in the evening. I had school, went to PSU for math tutoring, then back to Benson for nightschool. Nothing really cool happened tuesday, except for the fact that we had our Rose Festival assembly. In the end, some girl named Angela won, even though i didn't go to the last assembly at 2:40 because none of them were hot. Except for the asian, the asian girl is always hot. Also i got some new headphones for my MP3 player because "ERHEMMM" someone lost my headphones. If you're reading this john, go find them now so i can use these as my computer headphones instead!!!! Ass lobster.  Wednesday - Got to school, did the usual thing, except today we had a weird ass schedule where we got out at 12:15 because of sophomore forecasting. Don't ask me why we got out early because the sophomores had to forecast, but it was a strange thing. But it was kick ass at the same time because i got home early. Nothing terribly interesting happened that day except i had one of the most intense games of Battlefield 1942 i've ever played.  Thursday - Did the usual school thing. Go to school, learn stuff, sleep in 7th period, eat, etc... the usual. Then after school i went to Lloyd to meet Amanda and Aja and just hang out. I got there about 3:20 and cruised around. I found them at the Tilt around 3:30, even though they said to meet at 4:30, so i was a little shocked to see them there that early. For an hour, we cruised around the place and looked at all the stores as usual, we went into the pet store and looked at some pets. Amanda was looking at the ferrets mostly, me and Aja were checking out some of the dogs. Man if i ever get a dog, its going to be a siberian huskey, because those things are awesome. Then we looked at some rats, and Aja was laughing at the fact that they had the hugest nuts in the world. I swear to god, they were bigger then some of their heads it was insane.  At 4:30, ryder met us and we went back into the Tilt to play a few games. Mostly i played some Marvel Vs SNK 2, i kicked ryders ass with Terry, all 3 of his characters, because i rip shit up, then i played the computer and didnt last one level. Then we played a game of DDR, then ryder and Aja played some virtual fighter 4 and some Carnevil. After the games, we all got some pizza to eat. We all chipped in, and because Ryders PANSY ASS is vegitarian, we all got a big cheese pizza "BOOOOO", but it was damn good cheese pizza so i'm not complaining. We then cruised the mall some more after that, mainly we went to Barnes and Noble and checked out some of the books. Ryder and Aja were always cuddled together, hugging; Ryder carrying her, kissing her, whatever you call it, but somehow i didn't feel bad so that was a great change. At 6:00 i had to go because i had to do my CIM paper for history so that sucked. So i went home, didnt do the work and went to sleep  Friday - Woke up, went to school and did work. During lunch, we had a Tech Pep meeting and had some food and a guest speaker talk to us who works at the Portland Tribune. He talked to us about how our paper sucks balls and that there's typos every few words. "Yeah shut up i know i'm not the perfect typer", and Mr Melton told me we got that new Metroid game for the Game Boy Advance. w00t!!! New game for me to play/review. So that kicked ass. That was the main highlight of the day  Now i have to find out what the hell im doing for the weekend. Ryder's spending the whole weekend with his girlfriend, and Amandas off to her other grandma's funeral, and i'm all alone. So now i have to find something to do. I'm open to any ideas people.

      Man this week sucked nothing cool happened  Monday - Got to school, played gunbound, went to english, got assigned an essay that i still havent done, had math, lunch, 6th period, spanish, history then i went home.  Tuesday - BOOOOOO. Got to school at 8:15, had the usual assortment of classes, got some lunch from the deli, went to PSU after school, then night school and thats it!  Wednesday - BOOOO, got to school, didnt have lunch because i was broke, hung around watching flash movies on the computers in meltons room. That's it, oh yeah, my dad got me a new iPod!!! WOOHOO!!! 15 gig baby!! You can see it resting comfy on my sholder :D.   Thursday - Got to school, played with my new iPod, devin put windows 2k on all of our computers, realising that they were going to be "SNAPPY" on the 500 mhz POS machines we had, i stomped his ass by showing him he was wrong. In other related news, Devins skate board got stolen last week during tech show. And today he found half of it in one of his classes. My offical response?    urlLink Click here!   After i got out of school, Ryder came over to my house and gave me like 5 music CD's to rip, one of them was one i gave him a long time ago, its just my iPod doesnt have the labels for all the tracks. Then amanda called me and she told me that she was going to get evicted from Aja's apartment within the next 2 days and if she doesnt leave, Aja has to go also. So thats a bad ultimatum :(. And that concludes today  Friday - Sunday i will be watching like 300 or so middle schoolers at a state wide church 'Middle School Overnight'. I hope its fun!

      Ahhh, the short week is now ended. I will mainly cover of what happened at this years tech show.  Monday - Wednesday were regular days consisting of classes, food, friends and the usual sort of what happens in my life, also PSU and night school, so lets do the recap.    Thursday - Got to school at 8:00 with my computer to help assist with the task ahead, but mainly, to help set up the rock and ride chairs for tech show. Me, David M, Ben Buford, Sean, Mark, Jeff, Jordan and Bens girlfriend Heather came in to help bring the chairs all the way down from the clean room next to the CST class room and move them all the way up to E128, the old freshman electronics class room. So once we moved all the chairs up to E128, we needed to get the air hose in for the pnumatics that the chairs require for the tilting. So we got Mr. Hryciw "Last name is spelled correctly" to get us the compressed air hose up through a hole in the wall where the water pipes are and lead it down to the ground was. Once that was done, we began the long task of getting all the trillions of air hoses connected to the chairs, along with valve compressors.   The fun part of the first 2 hours was to securely tighten all the valves on. Every once and a while, a valve spring would pop loose and go shooting across the room, very entertaining. Once we had all the air connected securely, we needed to set up our computers for the 2nd phase of this daring task. I loaded up my computer first because i brought my joystick with me because it was USB, while all the other joysticks that were laying around the school were using the gameport on the back of peoples sound cards "Those never really worked, we needed to have adaptors for those'".  After we set it up, we needed to get the software for the chairs working. That took another 2 hours of hunting. After we got it, we turned the air on, loaded up the software, and huzzah! My chair was spinning in all directions. So we had one chair working.  Fast forward some hours later, we had tried hooking up the rest of the chairs, and only 2 were some what working. In the end, marks hard drive had a "Smart Drive" error, so he got royaly PWNED. We lost a computer because of that. Then my joystick somewhat died later on "Although it works now because its magic", so we had to borrow a logitech one and get that on my computer with the gameport adaptor. In the end, we only had one computer working with the chair "Mine". So to make it fun, we put warbirds on my computer, hooked it up to the projector and had fun till 9:00 when tech show ended.   "Incase you didnt know, i didnt go to a single class that day because im a hard core loser"   Friday - We had no school, but we all decided to go anyways to get all the damn chairs working. I got there and found ben walking around the school at 8:15. We got in the room and tried to figure out what the hell was wrong with all the computers. We came to the conclusion that windows XP hates gameports and doesnt like to respond to them. So we went down from 4 joysticks, to about 2. So in the end, we could only get a maximum of 2 chairs working.  Periodicly, people like Mark, Devin, David M and Chris would come in and see what was going on. Fast forward to 1:30, we all decided to walk to lloyd center to get some lunch, i got a subway sandwich. Why mention that? Because subway r0xx0rz your b0xx0rz. So we got back, and in the end, got one of the other joysticks to work. So that was great, we now had two chairs working  Fast forward to 6:00, tech show started, and we now had 2 chairs working instead of one. So that was cool. Yeah i like skipping things because i'm so tired.  During the course of the tech show, the webteam had made touch screens that displayed what was going in on each of the sections of the school. Someone though, had the best idea to put a hidden easter egg in the flash map. On random occasions, the screen would display the picture that i gave mark the idea of,  Mr Diss wearing fubu looking like a fat overweight model. So we had about 12 of those screens around the school, showing Diss in fubu. It was kind of funny.  At 9:00, my parents came and picked me up and we took my shiznit all home and i went to bed.  Oh yeah  Saturday - I went to the avalon today, thats all i did :-D  Gotta love that update

      What happened to the rest of the boring week? I have no clue, but i know one thing for certain, it was pretty damn dull and boring.  Wednesday - Nothing much happened. Except matt got me to go and download this game called Gunbound. It's pretty fun, it's like worms except instead of choosing weapons, you choose a mobile which has a set of prechosen weapons. It's kind of cool. Other than that, nothing else really happened that was worthy of note  Thursday - Me, David, Nick and Matt all downloaded Gunbound and played it on our CST computers. It's funny in the fact that it actually works on those computers, but it was great, we would always start playing when Diss was off talking to the seniors. That was the highlight of the day. But i got my statement from the iPod repair place. $150 to get it repaired, not counting the total $60 shipping fees. So my dad was like "hell no". I guess i'll either get a new iPod or something else, i dont know right now.  Friday - Played more gunbound during 1st and 2nd period. That was pretty fun. During lunch, we had free Big Town Hero. After that, it was off to home to do stuff i usualy do.  Fairy bland and boring week wouldnt you say?

      I hate CIM tests, today i had to come in to take the math CIM test because for some reason, i screwed it up sophomore year or something like that, i dont rememeber. Anyways, i got to school at 8:15, took the test and got out at 9:00 from the test. Why so early? Why did i finish that test so fast? Because i mainly bullshitted on it anyways. You dont need it for graduation, you're not graded on it and even if you fail, it doesnt do anything for you. You dont even know your results till the next school year. So what's the point in taking it? I dont know.  After the test i decided to wander around the school mindlessly for about 30 minutes. After that i went to get some coffee from the one tenis center, then i went back to school and got some chips and a cherry coke. With the ammount of caffinee in my blood stream, i hope that i can stay awake during 4th period with Slebos :P.   Why am i typing this now instead of later? Its 9:52, i have had nothing to do for an hour so i needed something to do to kill the time.  Anyways this will save time  Monday - Nothing terribly interesting happened. I got rice for lunch, had to do work during 6th period and yeah.. thats basically it, still dont have my iPod repaired  Tuesday - Today, now its about 9:53, still have no clue on whats going to happen later on, probably just a regular day with a CIM schedule, then after that, i have to go to PSU, then back to benson for nightschool, so once again i dont get home till about 9:00.. Whooopie!!!! :(  I love wasting time in the library!

      Another week over.... BORING  Monday -  Nothing really cool happened, beacause i forgot to do my entries every day, so if anything important happened, i cant really recall it  Tuesday - I broke my iPods headphone jack, so now my music player is busted until i can send it in to get repaired, so thats lame. Also school started at 10:30 because we had CIM tests going on, but i passed my CIM test, and got there at 8:15, so i had nothing to do for 2 hours and 15 minutes, so i hung out in the library. Besides that i had PSU and nightschool. BOOO  Wednesday -  During lunch, i went down to get a cherry coke from one of the vending machines near C-Wing. I put in my dollar, pressed the cherry coke button, and it got stuck inside the machine. I was pissed. I started hitting the machine and doing whatever i could to get my damn drink out of the machine. In the end, i tried a different strategy. I waited like 5 minutes for someone else to come down to get a drink. I saw some sophomore kid and i was like "Dude, get something from this machine, my cokes stuck in it and if you get something, it will probably knock it out", he was like "ok..". So he put his dollar in the machine, pressed the vanilla coke, and it knocked my cherry coke loose, and his coke got stuck.  --PWNED--  Thursday - Nothing really cool happened today. The only real thing was that i had to stay after school to retake my math test. It's funny, Mr. Slebos' teaches algebra 3-4 and Pre-Calculus. Both classes had a test, but when i went to retake my test, most of the precal class was there retaking their tests. There were so many people, every seat in the class was taken up. It was pretty funny. Other than that, nothing else happened. Except our computer tech support person, Dave smith, died of a stroke yesterday, so that sucks.  Next time i should just write an entry every day in a document and just put them all into another document and post that, it would be much easier, that's how i did my last post. Oh well... I wish my life was more interesting

      Monday - First day back from spring break. A bit depressing but now i have stuff to do!!! :O. Got to school on time which is always good. Lets see. CST was boring as hell, we didnt really learn much of anything new, we just looked at the text book some more, did some questions, and just sat around and listened to Diss nerd around for like ever. After that I had english, did some worksheets there, nothing too interesting. Then I had math, almost fell asleep as usual so that was fun. Had lunch, Spanish, history and went home. I found my Counter Strike CD-Key FINALY!!!! So i got to install Half Life and CS and get back into the game. New version is pretty pimp. Last game i played was around 11:00pm today. I got 2nd place with 14 kills, 10 deaths on the terrorist team. So somehow my skills have improved so thats totaly kick ass.    Tuesday - Man this was a long ass day as usual. We had a late opening so that was good. Got to school around 9:15ish, so i found nick and david and hung out with them for a bit, went to get some coffee, then went to CST. After CST, i saw Sean in the hallway and he was telling me "Dude, go to PDXLAN, we need someone like you to be our pilot for Battlefield, plus you rape at Call Of Duty, we could so use you", well not those exact words but something along those lines anyways. Besides, Evan was in MCT boasting about how good i was during Sams LAN during spring break, so that was cool. Since Sean pleaded at me to go, i got my dad to hook me up with $52 and send it VIA paypal to PDXLAN and registered for it during lunch, so that was bad ass. 400+ People LAN downtown, kick ass prizes, oh man it's going to be beautiful.  After school i went down to PSU for some math tutoring, then back to Benson for nightschool. I got there around 5:30 and just walked around for a bit. I saw Amber, Trae and Nadan just walking around mindlessly so i decided to join them. We just walked around the school until Amber had to go home around 6:00. We decided to follow Amber to her car and try to get her to not go. We all jumped on top of her car saying "YOU CANT GO NOW AHAHAHAHAAHAHAH" and so she started to drive around the parking lot with us on the roof. It was pretty funny. In the end, Trae tried to hold onto the railing on the back of the car, but amber hit the brakes and he fell off. It was pretty damn funny. When it came time for class, i just sat around and learned some more chemistry. Got home, played counterstrike and went to bed  Wednesday - Happy birthday to me!!! I'm now 17 years old!!! Yay. I got a message from amanda during 2nd period wishing me a happy bday "aww how sweet". Then they sang happy birthday to me in spanish class so that was pimp. After school i went with Aja and Amanda and went to see Dawn of the dead. Holy shit, that movie is awesome, i could do a review but if you want a better review, just go to maddox.xmission.com and check out his review for Dawn of the dead. What he says in it is all true, especially the part about tits on the screen. It was just like, WHAM, jugs right there. That was tight. After the movie we went to Taco Bell to get some dinner. I saw Isaac there somehow so i said hi to him. After that i went back to Aja's apartment and got my gift from them. Some pasta, a new wallet and a new necklace. It was pretty tight. Then i went home and went to bed.  Thursday - April fools day!! What was my prank? Walking in dog shit, then smearing the poo all over my CST class room. Well that wasnt really my joke, it just happened by accident. Fucking dogs. Spent 40 minutes cleaning up the class room then my shoes. At 9:45, i went with Nick to go to the old gym for the Blood Drive that was going on. Since i had turned 17 wednesday, i was now eligable to donate!! w00t. So i got there, had to fill out forms with information like your birthday, SSN, name, the usual. After that, there was like 34 questions relating to you experiences in your life that may have affected your blood in anyway. Of course i was good so it was all answered easily. So when it came my turn, they said i was one of the fastest people to donate there because personaly, i have so much damn blood in my body that i could just bleed for a day straight and still keep going, in my opinion that is, because im godly and immortal. After i had my juice and cookies, me and Nick decied to say "Hell no" to 4th period, which was math, so we decided to just hike it up to Lloyd center and get some lunch. So i got some indian food, and nick got a Gyro. Then macigly, David Sherman pops out of no where and meets us there, so we talk about shit for like 2 minutes, then he goes back with his buddies and i go off to play some DDR to see if i my hypothesis on my blood was true. I played a total of 2 games, playing everything on heavy. I didn't get light-headed at all so it was all good. Most of the time Nick was playing soul caliber 2. After that, i went back to school, went to spanish class, history then went home.  Friday - Unlike the rest of the day, nothing really interesting happened, except some people were all dressed in formal atire because Benson is hosting the state wide VICA competition, so maybe that had something to do with it. The only real highlight was that we got free food in meltons room for tech pep, the sad thing was me and devin had to walk all the way up to big town hero to pick up all the subs. Whats sad about that? CHILD LABOR THATS WHAT!!!! bah why am i bitching, i got food, so it was totaly worth it.  And that wraps up the week once again folks

      Weeeeeeeeeeeeee  Monday - Not too much happened that i can remember. The internet was down ONCE again because the damn district has a problem with virus's, so i couldnt access my email and print off crucial stuff. Mark and sean invited me to go to LanSlide this weekend. Free lan party with like 50 people at Holiday Inn Express down in North West, so that might be tight. We started to watch The Last Samurai in history class for no reason, w00t.  Tuesday - Got out at the usual time and went to get my kick ass Taco Bell and some help with math. In my math class, the seniors had a math final they had to take, but since Slebos likes to make surprises, he made the whole class take the senior math final which covered "THE ENTIRE YEAR". Including first semester, i was fucked from the begining because i had studied like 2 hours over the 2nd semester materials. So when i took the first part, i was clueless as what to do. So that sucked. Also this was the seniors last day. Man , I actually got to know a lot of seniors this year. We didnt have many pranks going on this year, we only had one fire drill and that was during History  Wednesday - We had the 2nd part of the math final, which this part was over the 2nd semester material that i had studied for the past few days. I didn't do too hot on it either way because for me, studying never works right for me no matter what i do. We started to watch The Fast And The Furious in english so Mr. Melton could show us all these "Neat Camera Angles", yeah right. The movie was awesome though because i've never seen it before, so there were a ton of pimp rides in that movie. That charger in the end of the movie was bad ass.  Thursday - Nothing much happened thursday, except i got all the forms for Lan Slide printed out, so i'm ready to roll this weekend.  Friday - Interesting day. I get to school at the regular time, then the fire alarm goes off and we're thinking "It's the seniors getting revenge probably". Because there were still seniors at the school. So it's raining like mad outside and we all go out to the parking lot behind E-Wing. All the kids from CST and MCT were out in the same area, so since we had nothing to do, Sean got out his hackey sack and we had an idea since all the kids from both classes were there, we decided to play a huge game of 500 out in the Parking Lot. Me, Sean, Jordan, David, Devin, Ben, and Evan were just chilling outside, in the rain, playing 500 with a small hackey sack for about an hour. When we got back inside, the fire alarm went off again, so we went back out for some more 500 action. Then when it was all over we went back to CST for like 5 minutes because the whole Fire Drill thing screwed up our schedule. So we went to 3rd period from there  When i got to english, it turned out that a water main in C-Wing had ruptured, flooding all of C-Wing pretty bad. The water main was for all the sprinklers in the school, so that set off the fire alarm, shooting down the suspicion it was seniors. So we just watched the end of Fast and the Furious. When it was time for 4th, Richard said he had given me something to give Mr. Slebos. Heh, it was nice drawing he did of slebos with him pointing while winking saying "APPLY YOURSELF! FACTOR, AND THEN REDUCE!". I gave it to Mr. Slebos and he actually thought it was funny. During 4th period we had ANOTHER fire drill go off, this time it was fake. So we got to just hang out in front of the school this time. When that was over we all went back to math until that period ended.  During lunch, Sean randomly came up and just chilled with me up in meltons room. Then Sam "oh boy", came up also because he thought Tech Pep was still going to be published, but it wasnt because as i learned monday, Tech Pep had been cancled for the rest of the year due to funding issues, so that was extremely gay because i had written a review of Van Helsing over that weekend which i was going to print off monday, but we had that damn virus issue once again. Sam was dinking around on an iMac looking for Netscape Communicator "Don't ask why, but he wanted to listen to some 'Internet Radio' site" and found out that someone had deleted it. Sean was just messing with Sam and told him that he deleted Netscape because no one uses it "Truth right there, i use Firefox here at home though", and Sam just smacked Sean on the back of his head real hard for no reason. Now, this was unprovoked, so Sean took extreme notice of this and almost kicked Sams ass right there. I wouldnt blame him but Sean knows how to keep it cool, instead he told Melton and Melton, not knowing what really happened, told sean "Well you probably deserved it :D". But we explained it more what happened and Melton actaully understood what really went wrong so we settled it all out.  Since Sam has "Mental Problems", Melton decided he needed to call Sams mom to tell her what happened. He had me write up what exactly happened so i did that. But i thought it was funny, something very small turned out to be a major incident. So that was a little amusing.  When i got home, i found out the DSL was dead, so i tried the usual trouble shooting and couldnt figure out what was wrong. My dad told me he would fix it when he got back from getting some music from a friend of his. So he left around 5:00 and said he would be back at 7:00. So i took a famous 20 minute nap at 5:00 and woke up at 7:00. He got back and we found out nothing was wrong with the DSL, but the Ethernet HUB died. I don't know how it happened, but it just died. So we replaced the HUB with a switch and now everything works great here.  Cant wait till sunday to go to Lan Slide, hope i get a ride back home

      After that whole illness thing on the weekend that i have almost gotten over, i just still have a cough and my ears popping, i can start from tuesday.  Tuesday - No late opening, just the usual schedule. I had gotten back to CST to find out that the administration had changed all our passwords on our computers but my computer had an exception, whatever they did, it wouldnt start up at all, so that was extremely gay. I got pwned so badly because of that so i had to take the computer to the new tech guy at our school and he gave it to MCT to fix. Which means i'll never see it back ever again. After school i went to PSU for some Taco Bell and tutoring, then back to Benson for my last day of Night School. I was the only one who did the Final over the weekend so i felt proud of myself. Finished night school and went home!  Wednesday - Nothing really happened that day except i still didn't have my computer from CST back. So i still had nothing to do that day except watch nick and matt play Magic Punk, a fun little puzzle fighter game from the makers of Gunbound. It's pretty addicting i will admit that. Also when i got home, i found my old guitar that i somehow misplaced a few years ago. It was upstairs in the attic in a corner. So now that i found it, i think i'll start to learn how to play it. It's an old ass acoustic but it still works good.  Thursday - Nothing much happened thursday. Just school in general. I had to go that bible study that my mom makes me go to every Thursday but no one was there except Me, my mom, David and Jennifer. So all we did was just hang out till 8:00 then we all went home.  Friday - Today was crazy but i'll explain that in the end. Me and my mom had a fight on the way to school but i'll explain that in the end. When i got to CST, 1st period right when it started, we went into lockdown because some "Suspicious character with 'Violent Intentions' " Got into the school and spooked the administration. So we were in lockdown from 8:15 till 9:20. At 9:32 we went to watch the VICA assembly along with the senior end of the year video. The VICA video was boring, just random people milling around doing things, and the Senior video was total ass this year. The only cool thing about it was just the opening part with the intro from Final Fantasy 8 on it. That's all.  Anyways the crazy part of the day was that my mom had gotten spooked by my mid term so bad that she basicaly went insane. She said that she was going to make me drop out of high school and join this community college program that's for high schoolers. That would mean i would permanently leave benson and the class of 05 which has 400+ students and join a class with 30 people for the next few years. Since i have been at benson for 3 years now, something like this sounded retarded because first off, i dont want to get a fucking GED. I want to get a Diploma from Benson.  But the thing that scared me the most was that she said that plans for this have already been started and i quote "You're going to do this no matter what and there's nothing you can do about it". This scared the living shit out of me because no one had told me of this in the past few days or even weeks. She made it sound like no matter what i was going to be doing this and leaving everyone at Benson behind. So when i got to school i left a message on my Dad's cell telling him what the hell was going on. When i got out of 4th period, he called me exactly  AND I MEAN EXACTLY "This was freaky" right as it ended, because we had a special schedule, it was freaky. Anyways i talked to him about what was going on and he was totaly confused becuase he had no idea my mom was going to be doing this. He said that he would make sure i would stay in Benson because i protested this to the extreme with my mom. I almost never get into fights with my parents but this is a fight i needed to participate in. I will not leave Benson at all because i am now to involved in this school to leave at senior year. I know way too many people and i can't just leave them behind either. I made this point really clear to my mom and she still doesnt see it.  So i hope to god this all gets settled and i still get to continue going to Benson instead of some "Community College". I mean come on, this sounds retarded

      I'm Bored, I'm sick, so today i'm going to blog at least once every time of the day. As in the morning, afternoon and evening. This is an exclusive people!!  Anyways. I got this ugly cold like saturday and i don't know how. I woke up feeling fine as usual. Then around 9:00, i started to get a sore throat and i couldnt find out why that was. So i figured A.) It was just something strange in the air or B.) I was going to *GASP* get sick for the first time in 2004. Unfortinatly choice B struck me when i woke up sunday. So that was really lame.  I hate colds. They really piss me off cause i always feel like shit. Of course it will go away after a while but still, i only get like one or two colds a year. So i woke up today, with a sore throat, a stuffed up nose and a mad headache. It gets even worse if there's a lot of light outside so i don't understand that. I'm not a goth damnit!!! :P.  So back on track, i woke up at 7:30am to see if i could face the challange of school today. I tried to find out if my body could take it. Judging of how tired i was early in the day, i figured i would probably fall asleep "Or pass out" during a class because for some reason, this cold makes me extremely exhausted, and this is new.... Also the fact that light makes my head hurt like a bitch for some reason made me think "Bah, lets just chill at home today". So here you go, i'm chillin at home  I still haven't had breakfast yet, but i'm still chillin on AIM and i played a few games of Gunbound with Matt from here because Matt never does his work in CST. I also chatted with Nick a little but that's what s goin down right now.   Also i'm listenin to a bumpin Trance internet stream. I used to listen to  urlLink Di.Fm  back in the day when their 128k bit stream was still free, but now they charge for it. So i checked out iTunes "Because my iPod was in the state of recharging" and the radio stations and found a tight 160kbps stream.  urlLink P h i l o s o m a t i k a , it's a great stream if you like trance/techno "Free publicity guys ;)". So check it out if you like it.  I should go get some breakfast... Expect more updates later

      I logged on the blogger the other day to find that the whole site had been recently redone, along with adding new templates. So i browsed the template and found that this one was pretty kick ass, so that explains the new look to the site. I spent a few minutes trying to figure out where to put the links on my page and beleive me it took a while because the HTML here was confusing. Instead of having my webcam, i just decided to make the profile picture here my permanent picture because who looks at this site anyways? Anyways, on with the show.  Monday - The whole portland pulbic school district got hit with a nasty ass trojan so it shut down the interent all over the school district so that was extremely gay. How ever, you could still use AOL instant messanger but not Internet Explorer, so that was strange. I was spending all of CST scanning my hard drive and it found the trojan and removed it, but this one file, ctfmon.exe, or something like that, was eating up 100% of my CPU power most of the time, so that was queer. I couldnt remove that program no matter what i did. So i didnt do anything in CST period except combat that virus.  Tuesday - We had a half day because the district decided to cancel all of our remaining late openings at benson. So we got out at 12:30. I didnt have anything to do, but Mark and Heather invited me to go with them and Ben, Phill, Jeff and Matt to see Van Hellsing at the Lloyd Cinema. So i figured what the hell why not go. The movie itself really didn't have much of a plot. It's just "Let's kill random fictional characters for no reason". The action was somewhat cheesy but i liked it. After the movie i had to jet to PSU for some tutoring and some Taco Bell because Taco Bell is the best fast food ever. Then it was back to Benson once again for night school. Only one more session left!!! Oh yeah, i brought doom legacy with me to put on all the CST computers so that our whole class could have massive Doom 2 Coop action.  Wednesday - We had a sub in slebos, so that was cool. Other than that nothing else really happened except that we had a spanish test that i think i pimped becuase i knew what i was doing on it.  Thursday - Man thursday was messed up. During 4th period, a Jones Soda truck pulled up to the front of the school and they were handing out free Jones soda to anyone that came up to the truck, so all these freshman coming back from the Gym got a free Jones soda, but the gayest thing ever, Mr Otopaul came out and told the truck to leave the school. WTF!?!?!?! It's not against the law what they're doing!! So all the stinky ass freshman got a Jones soda and i didn't, so that was really fucking lame, I'm still pissed off because Jones soda is the best soda in the world.  The next thing was that after 4th period, i went to put my backpack in meltons room and go get some rice, when i came back after lunch, the room was locked. So when Eric and Charlie came up, we couldnt go in the room. So we just decided to go to the Gym and laugh at the freshman. Well not really, we just hung out on the bleechers. Plus the freshman were out bowling and all the T.A.'s were there all alone playing basket ball. So we laughed at how much Nick sucked ass at basketball.  When 6th period ended, i went back to see if melton had come back yet and it turned out he hadn't. So i had to go to spanish class without my backpack so that was hella lame. Near the end of 7th period i went back to see if melton was back, AND HE STILL WASN'T BACK!!!! ugh. So i had to go the main office to see if i could get the key to his room. I got troy to unlock the door for me and i got my backpack back just in time for 8th period.   I got to history and Lilibo had some weird thing going on. He had some sort of Etheopian Coffee Set on his desk, along with some popcorn and bread. We had our 70's test that day which was basicaly an essay test. I did pretty well on it i think. Then we started to watch Master and Commander. I saw that movie earlier in the year in the Theatres when it first came out so i knew what happened in the movie. How did this relate to the 70's? Don't ask me...  Friday - Boring day, except we had the diversity assembly after CST. There was a Job Training workshop going on in the cafeteria that was for the seniors, but Mr. Diss said that we could go to. Knowing how much i  LOVE  CST, I decided to go to this workshop. Some dude was down there giving people the talk that Mr Melton gave us earlier in the year, so most of the stuff he talked about i already knew, so it was boring.  The diversity assembly this year was pretty boring, mainly it was the same stuff last year, the dragon dance, african drum dances, fashion show and the works. Once again, i declare its not a diverse assembly because, THERE WERE NO WHITE PEOPLE PERIOD. Cant forget the crackers bitches!!! :(  So theres this week once again

      Yet another boring and lame week, oh well lets do the recap  From the middle school overnight last friday - sunday, it was a pretty fun time. The staff that was there, me, brittney, katie, brian, nick and luke, we got to know eachother real quick. I thought katie was cool because we had the exact same taste in music. We took all of friday getting to know eachother basicaly. Since we were so cool, we all decided to sleep in one room. The senior staff didnt seem to care friday but they were afriad that "Oh snap! They might have sex down there if they all sleep in one room!". Unfortianatly, that didnt happen at all but we all stayed up till about 4 in the morning talking about random stuff. Saturday - Sunday the kids came and we all had a fun time. Big water fight at 2:00 in the afternoon, so that was cool. That's all i can really remember  Monday - School was same old same old, except we had a sub in CST. That was sweet. So i played gunbound with matt the whole time. The sub kept asking me what i was doing, so i said i was "Helping to test out the netcode in a program that we are making". He beleived it so i felt cool. That was the only thing worthy of note.  Tuesday - We had the same sub in CST the next day. But instead of playing gunbound, i decided to play around with DOS and send netsends to everyone. I made a batch file that sent infinite loops to a specific person for everyone in the class. So they had better not mess. I actually did chapter 3 questions too. After schoo, the usual PSU and Nightschool thing.  Wednesday - Diss was back in CST. The sub had left him a note saying that i was disruptive to the class. I was like "WTF!??!" How the hell was i disruptive. All i was doing was what everyone else in the damn class was doing. Either gunbound or work. I swear to god every teacher that ever comes into the room is automaticly against me for no reason. So Diss gave me a lecture for like 5 minutes "DONT BE DISRUPTIVE" even though i dont know what the hell i did that was wrong and caused me to be "Disruptive". So that was queer. That's the only thing i remember about that day  Thursday - Nothing realy interesting happened that day, except that i went to watch like 40 kids play football in the field without wearing any protection. So that looked hardcore. Nick invited me to play, but i saw what was going on and came to the conclusion that my body would probably snap in half if i played, so i just decided to watch the game instead. I had to do my speach in spanish that i hadn't even begun to memorize. So when 7th period came, we practiced for 10 minutes non stop. When it came to my groups turn, i magicly remembered all my lines correctly, i felt skilled there.  Friday - Man today was weird. First in my english class, we had a sub and i swear to god, she looked like a complete hooker. Orange hair, fishnet stalkings, big black boots and a small shirt. Weird ass looking person. During english, me, Dan and Richard were bored because we had finished all of our work, so i decided to whip out my iPod and just blast random songs like Uncle Fucker, from south park. The sub heard the song from the desk and she wanted to listen to it. Instead of taking it away, she thought the song was great. ahahaha, dan and richard were cracking up because they thought i would get owned so bad, but she liked the song and thanked me. I was like "lolololololol"  The lame part of the day was that the sub had ditched the class at lunchtime and 6th period so i had no where to go today. So i decided to follow nick and his group of people and just talk about random shit. Like alex and me and nick talked about how pimp the Bozar was in Fallout 2, along with other things in that game that made it awesome. After lunch, i followed nick to Mrs Petersons class and be a fake T.A for the day. So i just hung out in the gym 6th period laughing at all the weak freshman struggle to jog for 5 minutes. Holy crap, these kids could barely keep a pace going. In the last 10 minutes of 6th period, me, Nick, Getachu and Steven decided to play a few games of 13 before the period ended.  The coolest part of the day? Seeing two hot ass lesbians on the bus gropeing eachother. Oh man that was cool, almost poped one  So yep, there's the weekly recap once again.

It's pretty sweet, nice stuff too.  Not much has happened in the past few days, I beat UT2k4, currently i'm practicing for the onslaught tournament at PDX Lan. I got Call of Duty to work online, totaly bad ass! um, got back into DDR so i hooked my pad back up cause i found my adaptor. w00t! Now to practice some more!

      WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  I got my PC back up and running as of today, extremely nice since i blew it up 3 weeks ago, having to use my old mac G4 in the time being. So this is much nicer.  Most of this week was spent playing unreal and starcraft because i dont have many new games for a 400mhz G4. So there you go. Installed UT2k4, fucking bad ass game. Hope to get more practice for PDX Lan in the next 2 weeks before it starts.

      Well, today was fairly fun. The start of my big adventure was at 2:45 when i left the house on my bike to see "The Chronicles of Riddick". I got to the theatre and somehow my back tire went completly flat. I looked at the tire and it didn't look like it was damaged at all, so i guess either it tore somewhere i couldnt see, or that i just didnt put the cap on tight enough, or something else i dont know.  The movie was bad ass. It's basicaly a story about one of the characters from pitch black, Riddick, thrown into a whole new universe. The main plot is he's supposed to stop this necromonger invasion of a planet. The best part in the movie in my opinion is when he kills a guy with a tea cup. That was just pure fucking ownage right there.  Great movie, i reccomend it to anyone who's a fan of Sci-Fi movies  Anyways, i tried to get my bike's tire pumped up at Gi-Joes because it was nearby. I got one of the assisants to try to pump it up but for some reason their pumps were being gay and not even working on my tire. So in the end i had to walk the bike all the way from Century 16 to my house. Which is a good mile and a half.  When i got home i put my bike away, and then jetted onto the 14 to get to Aja's apartment to just chill with her and Ryder. On the bus i saw Matt Baker "A kid i knew from middle school" and his HOT girlfriend. I haven't seen that fool for like 3 years, but i didn't get a chance to talk to him. Anyways back on track, I got to Aja's apartment and i found out Amanda installed Step Mania on Aja's computer. So i had some fun with that. We had some pasta for dinner, but most of the time was spent playing Step Mania. For some magical reason, Ryder now pimps at it on the keyboard. I don't know how but it's one of those magical things i guess.  When i had to leave, it was about 10:30pm. So i said my good byes and headed down to the MAX. I saw my Math tutor on the MAX but i didn't really say hi to him, hell i bet he doesn't even like me because of how stupid i am at math. When i got to the 14 bus stop, some bum was going around selling legit bus transfers for 55 cents. Since i can identify real well if it's a scam or not, i checked my old transfer's day code and compared it to his, and it was good. So i payed  him 55 cents and he gave me a legit transfer and it was all good. I got on the bus no problem, he came up to me on the bus, asked me for the money, i gave it to him, he left, it was all good! SCORE!!!  So that goes this day in a nutshell

      First day of summer break. Ahh the joy and glee of waking up at 11:30 and having ice cream for breakfast while listening to music on my iPod and playing super mario advance on my gameboy. This my friends, is freedom. Most of the day was spent loafing around on the couch doing nothing, but alas, i got outside today. I got a call from tech support, they told me to send in my motherboard. So tomorow, i'm taking the motherboard to PC-Club and they'll fill out all the forms for me because my dad forgot to email Gigabyte for the forms, so that will take longer. So we'll just let PC-Club do it for us.  I went to go see the new harry potter film. It was pretty decent. The 3rd book i think was well done, but some people say otherwise. Anyways, i applied for a job at Century 16 using this weird keypad. So i filled out my information and sent it in. Lets hope for the best.

      SCHOOL - IS - OUT - FOR - THE - SUMMER!!! HORRAH!!!!!!!  Finaly, the end of junior year has come. Now to go over the highlights of the best of this year, some of which i didnt mention at all  *Nick R. got caught fucking a girl in the bathroom and got sent to jail for statatory rape *Kalen got caught beating off to porn in architechture *I shot myself in the eye with a rubberband and blamed Eric *Pimped out Tech Show with my computer, while it was still working *I got to keep a free Game Boy SP from Mr Melton, because he let me *I also got to keep one of his flash's for a camera that he gave me *I went to about 4 LAN's this whole school year, going to PDX in the summer *Fried 2 motherboards, still waiting for a response from tech support *Made really good friends with these two girls *Got to T.A. for an empty period and got credit for it *Sam slapping Sean on the back of the head, and having Melton call Sam's mom because of it. "OWNED"  And many many more, but less important items. Now to go with the recap of the last week of junior year  Monday - I had three finals. First was day one of CST Finals. All i had to do was a 11 question final that was super easy, and do some programs. English, i had to do an extra credit essay and i had to get 8/10 questions right to boost my grade up. When it came lunch time, i decided to go to lloyd center, but i caught up with Sean, Ben, Jordan, Heather, Andy and Michele and went with them to Pioneer place. I got a milk shake instead of food because i was going to go get Taco Bell after school. I got back to do my spanish final, and Jordan and Sean had to go to Slebos for their test. It was 12:50, and they were 5 minutes late, since they had slebos, they had to come in during make up. I got to spanish and it was ok i was 5 minutes late. Speaking of spanish, i got a 100% on my speaking final which got me up to 79%. I did this extra essay so i get a 80%. w00t  Tuesday - Only two finals. First was the last day of CST finals, where i just fixed up my programs and finished the Final. Nothing big. After that was Slebos, took the math test and at the end, realised i still had my dad's keys because i forgot to give them back to him after i found my gameboy in the car. So he was carless until i got home, but luckaly, he found a copy of his Suburu key, so he was ok. For lunch, i had some indian food, played some DDR, went home and just kicked it.  WEDNESDAY = FINAL DAY Today i only had one final, but i had to go in the first 10 minutes of 6th period to Diss' class to fix my programs because for some strange reason they kept overwriting eachother. So that was easy. All of 6th period though was spent helping Mr Melton pack up his room for the summer. Me and Charlie were taking all the books, electronics, and stuff that we thought might be valuable, put them in boxes and stacked them in the darkroom for the rest of the year. Last Final was in U.S. History. It was 33 questions related to the whole 2nd semester. It was the easiest test ever. Got a 97% on it, because we graded eachothers papers. So for the rest of the period, we just played cards.  The bell rang at 11:45, and we were OUT!!!! I was off to celebrate with about 15 kids by first going down to Taco Bell and eating some lunch. After that, it was off to Lauralhurst park to play a big ass game of Capture The Flag, but with some blunt weapons. Sounds like fun? So when we got there, we went to Pauls house to get the weapons. I swear we looked like a Lynch gang. 15 people with weapons just walking all the way to the park. When we got there, i was the one who got to get the beastly Maul. Such a bad ass weapon for what it's worth. No one could take me on without getting smashed by my godly weapon. But anyways, we all got into 2 groups of 8 and went out to hide our flags all across the park. The first game, i was just crusing around the park all by myself waiting to ambush someone. I got my chance. This one 8th grader that was with us told me some dudes were walking down the stairs. I heard them coming down so i hid behind a bush. Right as they walked by me, i smashed one of them in the ribs and he almost fell down the stairs. It was SO AWESOME!!!!  We did another game of CTF, but then like 3 games of Team Deathmatch. This all went on from 1:30 when we got there, till about 4:30, when i decided i had enough and i went home on the bus.  Fairly fun day i had. Fairly fun year too. I hope to have more in the future

      Well nothing really interesting has happened this week except for the fact that it is the last week of school for my junior year. So much has happened this year that i haven't documented because i haven't felt like doing it, or it was just too personal to show. But other than that, i only have 3 days of finals then Junior year is over. HUZZAH!!!!!! Now to recap the last full week  Monday - I got this day off due to memorial day weekend.  As i stated before, i killed my motherboard ONCE AGAIN. When i turned it on at the lan party, it went into BIOS-auto-recover mode. It did that for 10 minutes and i didnt hear anything going on. So i reset it and now it wont start up what so ever. GO ME!!! So i have to either send this board in or once again, buy a new one.  Tuesday - First day of the week of school. I was out of a computer because i had put Mandrake Linux on my old G4 but it wasn't working right because for some reason the X GUI didn't install. So i didnt decide to act on this until thursday. Mainly what i did  this day was go to a Math Tutor and get some taco bell then i came home. Since i had nothing  to do on a computer what so ever, i decided to go home and watch movies on TV. The worst part of the day, the only thing on was Waterworld. A boring movie but what ever, i had nothing else to do that day.  Wednesday - This was mainly a repeat of yesterday, minus the fact that i dont go to PSU on wednesdays. I went home as usual from school and watched another movie. This time it was Pitch Black following the making of the Chronicles of Riddick. Omfg that movie looks ownage. Especialy since Riddick in Pitch Black was a bad ass character, i bet this movie will go down pretty well.  Thursday - I had it. I decided that i would actually get my G4 up and running with some operating systems such as OSX 10.3 and Yellow Dog Linux. That took 4 hours putting both systems on that i beat Metroid Zero Mission FINALY! But when they were on, i dinked around in linux for a bit, then i switched back to OSX so i could finish some english homework.  Friday - The last day of the week. Today i get to have free food from Big Town Hero courtesy of Mr. Melton because Melton is awesome. We have an assembly at 9:47 which i dont know what it is about. Other than that, i get to go home and make my Spanish Paper for my Oral final which i need to get a 20% on to get my grade up. Man thats going to be hard, 20% guys, do you think i can make it? I think it's a long stretch  Only 3 more actual school days then i become a SENIOR!!! w00t

      Well, too bad for ryder. Aja broke up with him monday. They apparently got into a fight on thursday about something to do with amandas brother, but im not sure. Either way ryder = pwned.     It's great, they hooked up like sometime in february  , and now they broke up. Oh well, i got him a girlfriend, got him laid, and what did i get in return? Nothing really except lots of music cd's when he comes over to play KOTOR. Oh well, he owes me some day.    Been playing lots of Need For Speed: Underground lately. Been kicking some ass online. Man, RX-7 is great. So far my max speed is only 229.7 on the drag races. I always come SO CLOSE to burning out my engine. I still kick ass :D    Hopefuly my Geforce 5900xt OC from BFG will come today. I need sweet graphics!!

      This early morning was fun. By early, i mean 1:00 in the morning. Ryder called me hoping that i would still be up and i was!! So he was lucky. He was reformating his sisters computer. He called me asking for instructions on how to install XP. It sounded easy, but he was upgrading from 2k. and 2k was being a bitch. Since all the stuff i was explaining to them couldnt be found over there i was like "Fuck it". So i took my bike, tried not to wake up my mom and went over there and reformatted Cassidys computer and put XP on it and got home at 2:00 am.     That was fun and adventerous. Always wanted to ride my bike late at night. I got home, mark harrased me to play some CoD. So once again i was like "fuck it" and played some CoD. At 2:30 i finaly went to sleep!!! Yay    I woke up at 10:00, played more CoD online, then ryder came over to play some KoTOR. And now its 10:45 and he's gone. Yay!

      Man, a horrible trajedy happened the other day. There's this romanian family thats currently taking care of my grandma at their own house. We found out that i think friday, that George, his wife Daniela, and 3 of their kids, were all killed in a car crash. From what my mom told me, she said that George fell asleep at the wheel, according to what she saw off of the news. Horrible news. Luckily my grandma was still at the house being taken care of other people staying there while georges family were on their way for a vacation. Really sad news...    Only god can watch over their family now.

      Another hot day in portland. Man it's been a heat wave lately. But it is summer *durh* so it should be obvious.     Woke up at 11:45 this morning. Gotta love sleeping in. My record so far this summer is only 1:30 :/. WEAK. Watched some TV for a bit, then started up my game of Knights of the old republic. Aww yeah. Star wars games own. Then ryder called and said that his mom was refusing to drive him over to music warehouse to pick up some cd's. He wanted me to go with him and walk up there. So we did. He got a Jethro Tull cd and a Pink Floyd cd. I gave him $2 to get the jethro tull cd cause he was short. Once that was done we went to starbucks and got some coffee. Nothing like over priced coffee. Mmmmmm, caramel frapachino.     Once that was done, we went back to my place, i ripped the music and then when he left. played more KOTOR!!!! :D.     Productivity at its best once again

      Horray! Another fight in the neighborhood! Different neighbors, SAME HOUSE!!!! WOW ITS A CRAZY COINCIDENCE. I'm sick and tired of these fucking morons moving in. And now they're moving out. They started yelling at eachother around midnight, then at 12:20, one of the guys i think threw a box of stuff the girl that's moving out had, and cussed loudly at this other dude, or some shit like that.

      Man that was hella lame. We had a power outage here from 11:00 pm till about  Midnight. So we were out of power for about an hour here. I was so bored that i decided to go cruise around the dark neighborhood in my robe and boxers. I wanted to do that naked but, i didnt want to see any cops anywhere :P. Either way i scared the shit out of my dad when he came down stairs. That was some good times right there :D  Man darkness rules, except when my computer goes down because of darkness, then it sucks :P

      Now that i've somewhat regained my strength from PDX Lan i guess i should update on what happened at PDX Lan 2004  When i first got there thursday at 7:00 there was a big ass line. The whole benson webteam was right in front of the line but i had to go to the back so that totaly sucked ass. The line didnt move for an hour because Pat's a moron that crashed the network, well thats what i heard anyways. My dad had to leave at 7:30 because the line still wasnt moving so i had to put my PC somewhere. Some guy next to me in line said i could put my stuff in his car so i did. My dad had to leave because my grandma had to go to the hospital. At 8:10 the line started to pick up finaly. At 8:20 i got inside and got my badge!!! Then i proceeded to take all my stuff out of the guys car, i think he said his name was Todd, went over to EX seating and put all my shit there!  When everything was set up, Me, Ben, Evan, Kenny and Sam decided to practice playing battlefield vietnam for the tournament that was going to happen the next day. We just played against bots the whole time. After we did that for about an hour we challanged a random team in the room to a game. We lost horribly so our chances for the tournament were very slim. At about 2:00 me mark and sean went up to our hotel room to get some sleep. We turned on the TV and found some Richard Gerre movie on, i think it was called breathless. It was one of the worst movies i've ever seen, but at the same time it was hilarious because of the random things in it. Like for the fact that there were Tits, A sudden change of cars in one scene, lightsabre dueling, a musical ending, dancing, humping, driving in mexico and a lot of other random stuff. We were having a ball with a lot of this random shit! So when it was about 4:00, Menes and Chuman, the other roommates, came in and we all tried to get some sleep. I think i had too much caffine so i couldnt sleep, so i got up at 4:30 and went downstairs to my computer.  I browsed the network for a while and found some stuff to download off peoples computer. The ammount of porn on the network was insane! Not saying i downloaded any of it ;) ;) ;), but there was at least 100 gigs total on someones hard drive. I just pulled off a few games that morning. When it came time for the tournament, someone released the Sasser worm on the network so tournments got delayed for about an hour. Thank god too because Kenny and Evan came at least an hour late. When it was tournament time, we all loaded up the server, then BLAM!! The power in the EX room went out, so we spent 10 minutes fixing that, then we got back in the server and told the opposing team in game what happened. Then BLAM!! Power went out again, this time it took 20 minutes.   We got back in the game, bitched about our power then BLAM!!!! another 10 minutes. This happened about 5 times, then we gave up because even though every match we played we beat them, we couldnt deal with the constant power outages. So that sucked ass. The rest of Friday was spent just playing random games or watching seans CoD team lose. Me, mark, ben, sean and will decided to go swimming in the pool. We played marco polo and threw ben in the pool because it was fun. Then we went into the work out room and saw mark fall down on the treadmill, now that was priceless. After that i went to bed cause i had been up over 24 hours.  Saturday i woke up hoping to play in the UT2k4 onslaught tournament, but i woke up too late so i couldnt do that, oh well shit happens. Ben set up a IRC server for FTP servers around PDX, so most of saturday was spent downloading around 300+ mp3's, some games and some movies. There was the farcry FFA tournament which i did. I got to the 2nd bracket, winning the first bracket by tieing for 1st place. 2nd bracket i got 3rd place, i was down by 2, so that sucked ass. About 2:00 i went to bed.  We woke up and found out we had to get our stuff out of the EX room by 11:30, that sucked so much ass cause i was going to download a lot of stuff before then. So we had to pack up early and head over to the main hall for the final raffle. In the end, i won a lightup mouse pad. Woohoo :/, Sean won a case, Jordan won a Intel Extreme Edition Processor + motherboard. So i got a shit prize :(. But it lights up :D. Around 3:00 my mom came and picked me up, i put all the stuff in the car and went home, except i forgot my backpack with all my shit in it, so we had to drive back and get it.  Other then our battlefield vietnam team getting shafted, PDX Lan was pretty fun i would say.

      Ahh the great outdoors. I just got back from a camping/fishing trip with ryder and his dad and a few of his dad's friends. Great few days to just sit back and relax with mother nature without me on the damn computer.  Wednesday - Me, Ryder and George "Ryders dad" arrived at detroit lake. We set up our tents and unpacked everything. When we unpacked all of our stuff, we decided we would take Georges boat out onto the water and go fishing. He has a nice motor boat that gave us trouble on the last 2 days of the trip but thats later on in the story. When we got the boat onto the dock, we lowered it into the water off the ramp, brought it around for launch, then when we were ready, BAM, we were off. We were doing about 50mph on the water while we were all standing trying to take in some fresh air. We cruised the water for about 10 minutes before actually finding a spot to fish. When we found one, we just sat there for about an hour or so trying to catch some fish. Unfortunatly we didnt really catch any fish, so it was basicaly just a spot to just kick it on the water. We tried another spot for about 20 minutes then we just decided to go back to the campsite because it was 6:30 already. We got back, had some dinner and talked about stuff, then at 9:30 we went to bed because george wanted to wake us up to go fishing at 5:00 in the morning.  Thursday - During the night, it rained pretty hard so everything was soaked when we woke up. George cooked us some breakfast and we ate well! Well i ate good at least. At that time it was currently sunny. So we decided to try the boat again. We got out on the water around 5:30am and found various fishing places to hang out at. We did that from about 6:00 am till about 2:00 am before we headed in for lunch. We still hadn't caught a damn fish :(. We then took a break and George took a nap for a little bit. Then we were back out the water once again trying to catch more fish. At 7:00 pm, we gave up again and took the boat back to shore.  So far it wasnt looking too good for us. So we had some dinner, chilled out by the fire and i started to read this book ryder gave me called Youth in Revolt. Then at 9:00ish pm we decided to go to bed again.  Friday - OMFG, i swear it rained the whole god damn day. So from 7:00 am till about 8:00 pm we were just stuck in our tents because it was pouring down rain the whole damn day. In that time, as i said, Ryder brought me a book to read called Youth in Revolt. Not a bad Book. I thought it was pretty damn good. It's a comedy kind of book based on the life of this kid named Nick Twisp. His experiences as a transvestite trying to hide from the FBI while his real quest is to get laid at the age of 15. Of course that isnt the real premise of the book, but thats mainly the last 3rd of the book. So i started to read that book for the whole time it rained and got to about page 220. No i dont read slow, i actually exaggerated the whole time frame there. It was more like from 12:00 to 4:00. At 5:00 the rain started to die down, so we decided to take the boat out on the water. Everything was going good then the engine started to act up on the motor and stall a lot. George tried to figure out what the hell was going on then we found out we were in a sticky situation when the engine wouldnt start. We spend like 30 minutes trying to fix it but we were cluesless at the moment. George had a theory that it was the carborator. So we had to try to get the boat to shore but that proved to be a bitch. While working on the boat, his coat went overboard. Of course we were like "Nooo!!!" . So ryder tried to fish it out with a fishing pole but in the end he snagged rocks and the coat was drifting farther and farther away. So i was like "Fuck it", took off all my electronics and just dove in the water after it. It was really refreshing water too. I finaly got it but god damn it weighed like 40 lbs in the water. Then we i tried to get out of the water, my Lee Dungarees weighed like 50 extra lbs, so i had to climb up on the motor cause i couldnt climb on the boat itself. To get to shore, we were hoping the engine might ignite and propel us to shore with just lots of igition turns. We were really lucky and the engine started for a little bit in 10 second intervals. So we luckaly got it back to the docks and eventualy out of the water back to the campground  Around 8:00 pm Georges girlfriend and her friends arrived around 8:00. Daniele who is Georges 21 year old girlfriend "while george is 44" brought her daughter Zoe who's 7, and her friend Valyrie with her boyfriend Brandon who was 27. Man these were some interesting people in my opinion. I'll get to that later. Me and ryder were tired because basicaly we hadnt done much of anything the whole day so we decided to go sleep around 10:00. We really go to sleep around 12:00 because everyone was up talking and doing some illegal things.... Oh fuck it who cares, they were all smoking pot and drinking beer. I didnt mind because i didnt get offered anything :(, but i could use a beer...  Saturday - Ahh. What a beautiful day. It was sunny all day. A great day to go swimming. George tried to work on the boat engine some more by cleaning out the carborator but it turned out not to work. So it looks like he just has to replace the carborator on the engine and it should work again, but he didnt bring an extra carborator with him so there were no more trips back out on the water. So we just hung out on the shore with chairs and just kicked it or swam in the water. Me and ryder were kicking eachothers ass in the water by dunking eachother, so that was fun, except i get tired hella fast so i got owned more then i owned him. :-/. Oh well i still had a lot of fun. Most of the day was spent doing that. I also got some tan for a change!!! Well more like sunburns all over but it stil works.  When we got back to the campsite around 6:00, we all had dinner, me and ryder continued to read our books and i actually finished my book. It was an easy book to read all the way through but thats a new record for me. A 496 page book in 3 days. Not bad for me because i rarely read these days. Since me and ryder didnt get much sleep the past day because everyone was up talking, we decided to stay up until everyone was asleep. When 11:00 came around. George brought up an interesting topic that we talked about for like 3 hours. How the music of the early 60's - late 70's compared to the Metal music of the current age portrayed how people protested. We had many arguements about how social political everything was or wasnt, George was pro social political to everything we brought up which was funny as hell. It's great when everyone's stoned talking about politics. But you really had to be there, i cant really talk about what we talked about in the end. Around 12:00 everyone went to bed for the final night of the camping trip.  Sunday - I woke up around 6:00 to the sound of two people doing the nasty "I bet you can guess who *cough* GEORGE *cough*, but i went back to sleep and woke up around 9:00. Ryder woke up at 9:30 and Zoe woke up at like 10:45. When we were all up we packed up all of our tents, all the supplies and decided to go to the shore one last time before we headed back to portland. When it was time to go we hit the road! While we were on the road, the futon that was fastened onto the top of the roof came off on the freeway and it got pwned by a semitruck, so ryder and his dad were hella pissed because that was a good futon. In case you were wondering, George brought a futon for him and daniele to sleep on together.  We got back to portland at Georges apartment which he manages, and we unloaded everything from his boat into the apartment. Then he dropped me off at my house with all my stuff and we said good bye. I got inside to find out I HAVE DOOM 3!!!!!!! KICK ASS  The game kicks ass! Its so damn scary everywhere you go! But enough nerding, This nerd needs some sleep.  Chippy Fishing roxx0rz
