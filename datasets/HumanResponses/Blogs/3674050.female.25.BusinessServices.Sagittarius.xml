      Why were you there when I got broken-hearted Why did you sweep me off my feet Why did you look at me with those beautiful eyes and then told me that everything is going to be alright?  Why are your eyes green Why are you so amazing Why are you always blushing Why did I fall for you and not knowing why?  Why were you out there and why was I here? What was the reason that God wanted us to meet without letting us to see each other? Were you wrong for me?  Why did I want you so bad and why would turn away from me?   .di.

      There were times when I opened my eyes    and the world is already chaotic    the place is a mess and the weather is pathetic    but I'll live    cause in my heart I know that I'll always have you    in your heart I'd rest my heart assured  There were times in my life when I looked around    and realized that I've lost the best things in life    my head is spinning and my hope is all gone    but I'll survive    I've been through the beating up and here I am    still breathing.    The rest of the world is a piece of cake cause    I know that you'll be here for me.  Will you? Will you stay with me when everything is a blur? Will you be here with me when everything is falling apart? Will you be the one for me when everything is not?

      Today Ryan said something very nice about me. I didn't know where all those words come from it's like it came out of nowhere..  he was cold. he was keeping the distance. but now he misses me all of the sudden? i don't get you, Ryan. did my affection finally get to you somehow? was it so obvious that i cared about you so much? i was. so much. but not anymore. now i'm cold. i'm heartless. i am bitchy now. can you see? yes. i am bitchy. i cannot believe it myself. it's like i'm turning into a complete different person. horrible person. i hate myself now. it's like, i can see myself turning old and bitter,  and be the Queen-oh-so-Bitchy! that's funny. life is funny anyway. you should never take it seriously. now i'm just being sarcastic. THIS WHOLE WORLD IS A JOKE. HA-HA. and that's it. in a blink of an eye you're turning cold. and old. and then you get sick. and then you die. it is pointless anyway. so why make a point? there's no use.  and there was a moment when i think about Ryan. oh yeah.. Ryan. the oh-so-sweet-and-thoughtful Ryan. i can't get you off my head. oh yeah.. he missed me while he was away. and he said, i am a diamond in a world of coal. am i really, Ryan? and he said i'm an angel. Angel. like xavier used to call me. AH. xavier said he missed me, too. isn't it funny. i don't even know what i should be thinking right at this point. well, ryan wins hands down. i know i'm always happy whenever i'm with him. he makes me happy. he made me forgot about xavier. he should be special, right? well, he is. there were times when he inspired me so much. i wrote him a poem. then a couple of poems. in one night. and then another one. and then another one. i made them all for him. but he just didn't know they were for him.  there was a time when he was the inspiration. God made him to be my inspiration. he is a beautiful creature. outside in. he is my bestfriend. he is my twin brother in a perfect world. and he became all that i wanted.  and there was a time when i broke my heart. somewhere down the road. i broke the so called unwritten rules when i let myself fall.  then of course.. in a perfect world we would be perfect. together. if only..  snap. back to reality. back to the harsh reality. and here i am now. writing almost four pages of my own personal thoughts that has no point. i should feel happy cause i haven't been able to write something like this in years. i feel like i'm more mature when i was 12. ahh.. get over it. you're 25 now and you're not getting younger. "quarter life crisis" like i would live to be a hundred. i won't bet on it.  people say, 'carpe diem' "seize the day" well, my day was crap and i'm tired. i just wish i'd have someone i can turn to whenever i got home.  there were times when i think about ryan.. the soul that i always adore.. have a good night, my sweet cheek. you will always be beautiful to me..

      There is a significant line between "being funny" and "insulting". Being funny is when you're making a joke and the people around you are laughing along with you, while insulting is when you're making a joke about one particular person and that joke isn't even funny anymore cause it's just wrong. I hate it when people deliberately insult me. I hate it when they laugh at me when they know it's not the right time to do it. Are they ignorant or are they simply inconsiderate? I'm not a child. I'm not deaf. I can clearly hear your voice, man, so can you shut up and keep it to yourself? Haven't you realized that I have a heart and dignity?  Some things are just unacceptable.

      I refused a chance to help an old friend today.  She's not really a "friend" friend but she was my friend. I refused to help her simply because I didn't want to. Instead I slept all day and I turned my cellphone off.  Oh yeah, one reason as to why I did what I did, because she was not a very good friend to me. She was difficult, she was hard-headed.  Does that explain why I did what I did? Have I become that horrible? I can't believe my own actions anymore.

      "...I'm goin to be on leave for the next few days, sampai sunday. I'm goin Bali!!!! Woohooo!!!! It will be my first time there. I'm goin w some frens??? Mahu ikut ngak???"  He leaves for Bali tomorrow. Aww.. :(  And he invited me today. What a great timing.  What makes me happy today is that he is still playing the game along with me.. Is he still available?  That is the 9 million dollar question, my friend. Stay tuned for more stories to come.  Have fun in Bali, Badrul.

      I guess I am smitten by one of the trainer of Bloomberg. Badrul.  I attended the Bloomberg training which he was teaching, and dude, he's the cutest trainer I have ever seen in my life.. :D (and I don't want to exaggerate, heheh)  We had a chance to talk, he seemed nice, and I noticed he's a real gentleman. He ran and got me a Bloomberg paper bag to put all my stuffs in there when I was already in the elevator. Isn't he a gentleman?   Oh.. just thinking about him makes me blush everytime. and oh.. he gave me an email after we had a little talk that day, and we give each other emails ever since.   Oh.. how he put a smile on my face. He's such the highlight of my day.. :)   and xavier started talking to me again. today.  P.S:  Now I know the song that everybody has been talking about. "Dirty Diana" by Michael Jackson. Someone nick named me by that name once. and i was wondering.. but not any more. heheh..

      the hardest part of being a real person is to deal with other people. all kinds of people who have their own needs, their own personalities, their own egos.. i couldn't say i can understand them entirely so i wouldn't want to expect the same thing in return from them. (sighs)  i'm tired now. i just got home from mr. norico's farewell party that i organized myself, alone. sure, i got some left-over pizza, but it really doesn't worth all the sweats and efforts, man. and did i mention how they appreciate my work? none. i got none appreciation whatsoever from them. instead i got a devious look at least from one of them.  that makes me wonder how grant life is. if i could survive this one, the rest of the world is a piece of cake. or so they say. isn't it really?  it's really tired to be me.

      Have you ever felt like,  your thoughts are always out there  when your body is right here?   It's like, you are never here where your body is.  You are always somewhere out there.  wondering.   It's like, you never belong with your body.  half of your soul is stolen away.  the essence of your life is gone.   you're here.  helpless.  with no hope.  no purpose.  weary. cold. suffocating.   breathing no oxygen.  reach but no help.   living the life without soul.

      I missed out John Mayer on Saturday Night Live earlier. I was like, "Damn! I missed it."  but to think about it, oh well.. I missed out on a lot of things in this world. the more I grow, the more I learn to let go  of a lot of things that weren't meant to be.

      "... in the heat of summer sunshine I miss you, like nobody else in the heat of summer sunshine I kiss you, like nobody needs to know.."   It is sucking the life out of me I'm losing the strength to move onward I don't have anything to hold on to It is a dark place out there and I'm losing my grip  I just want to share this love, this heart, this experience with someone why didn't I have the favor? why didn't I have the chance? Did I not give them enough chance and favor? Was I too blind?

      the one thing I learned about myself today is I can be mean. I can be very mean. and bitter. I'm not so nice. I'm not so sweet. I'm not that naive little girl anymore. I'm nobody's fool. I'm up for the game that you play. If you could play the game, I could too.  I'm not a fool.

      Why do people tell me to do the things that I don't want to do? Why do people tell me to be the person that I don't want to be? Why do people act like they know what's best for me?  I don't want to do it. I don't want to be who you want me to be. so what?  You're not my boss. I don't work for you.  You're not God. I don't owe you anything. I don't give a damn shit about what you're doing    so why do you bother to interfere with my life? Why do you push me around? Why do you act like you know everything? Why do you think you're in charge of my life? Why the hell bother? Do you think you can read my mind    and all of the sudden I will bow down to you?    that I will obey to all your instructions? that is the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me. I don't want you to read my mind. I don't want you to tell me what I don't want to know. I don't want you to lecture me how to live my own life. for God's sake.. for once I am in charge of my life and you came out of nowhere and just ruined it. I really don't appreciate it. at all.     .di. 18.6.04. 00.00

      Words don't exist if I weren't here  Why worry about the big things if you couldn't even do the small things?  I have a lot more respect for people who's willing to do the little things and getting paid way below of what they deserve to be paid.  they're the ones who make the world go round  they're the ones who make our life worth living   You are such a waste of anybody's time if you didn't even care about the little things that create the big things.  the people who are underpaid for doing the dirty work for you  the people whose work doesn't worth a sweat to you   I pity you, really  I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to  I'm not going to run around and do all your work  and be unappreciated   I see the little things put together  I see something behind them  and it's beautiful.   You go to the sun and be something big  when you couldn't even do the small things..  such a waste.    ---    I am thankful for the bus driver who takes me home every single day from work.  I am thankful for the man at work who makes me coffee or tea every morning.  I am thankful for the old man who's ready to sell the fried rice every night whenever I got hungry.  They are doing the little things that matters for very little money. and still be happy for doing them.  I know cause I see the smile on their faces. that's what I called ' living the life'  I am really proud of them.   For in this crazy world there are still people who would do the unappreciated noble work without feeling embarrased or inadequate.   For they complete my life.  I am truly grateful for them.    .di.  17.6.04.

      Tell me that I am wrong tell me that I am horrible tell me that I am heartless tell me that I am a loser.  but don't tell me how to live my life.  Tell me that I'm bitter tell me that I'm childish tell me that I'm ignorant tell me that I'm stupid.  but don't tell me I'm not real.  Tell me the sky isn't blue tell me the grass isn't green tell me the world isn't moving tell me the sun did not shine.  but please don't tell me life is a mistake.  I love you and I hate you..

      I miss everybody. I miss my life back then. I miss love. I miss..  crap. this coffee is getting to me. life has been "fantastic" lately. "the little things that make me crazy" the pressure is ripping me off my skin. I'm getting out of my mind. or am I getting older? fuck. I'm so sick and tired of doing everyone's dirty work. do I have a symbol on my forehead saying, "scape goat"? am I such a nice person and then everyone can just take advantage of me? am I that naive person? am I getting out of my mind? I'm pissed. I'm officially pissed. I don't have to apologize to them. I don't owe anyone any explanation. I live my own life. I've fucked it enough, so quit messing it up anymore. I really don't need it. I'm so sick of being in the middle of everything  and the one who gets all the blame.  I'm so sick of you, cowards! who are too immature to take your own responsibilities. I'm so sick of you, people who created problems without solving them.  I really do have my own limitation. and I am human.    ps. i miss my father. love you, dad.

      If I really dig deep in my heart, I don't want this. I don't want to screw other people's lifes. am I a tease, am I a mislead? am I wrong?  what I really want is "the buzz". "the buzz" that is going to make my life exciting. is it exciting? is it "the buzz" that I'm getting? yeah.. a little probably. but I don't want to be a terrible person. I really don't but I already am. I want this but I can't have this. I see it but I can't touch it. It's simple but it's a poison.  There's a "restricted" sign so I should stay away. but I'm already there.  Life is as complicated as it is. don't ruin it as much anymore.  Life is heaven and it is hell altogether.   di.

      I went out on a secret date with a married man. was it wrong? was it wishful thinking? was it stupid? was I way over my head? was it a dream?  He likes me. I think he does. that is flattering, I guess.  this thing is like a flower growing in the desert. this is actually wonderful in between the whole dryness in my life.  one of these moments I'll have to wake up from this dream.

      Life is grand. Life is beautiful. Life is the cloud. Life is thunder. Life is everywhere and all around me. Life is the air in the balloon. Life is the grass that you walk on. Life is the song that you hear, it doesn't matter if it's good or bad. Life is complicated. Life is misleading. Life is the tears that you cry. Life is a poetry in your mind. Life is a promise that you keep. Life is a lie in the tip of your tongue. Life is a broken wing. Life is the unspoken words. Life is an unfunny joke. Life is a deluded truth. Life is excruciating and ecstasy at the same time. Life is a friction of time. Life is a journey. Life is a miracle. Life is in your heart. Life is you and me, and the rest of the world. and life goes on until someone says stop.

      Today I experienced something weird. Weird, I should say? yeah..  I was sort of being accused of something embarassing that I DID NOT do. It's funny, really. this is like, the little thing that makes me crazy. i know this shouldn't matter much. but it is, making me crazy.  it should be nothing. come on.. this is the very last thing I need right now. other people have bigger problems than this.  well, it'll blow over soon. or tomorrow. who knows. I should've already forgotten about it. I'm tired. I need sleep. oh yeah.. tomorrow's a holiday.  hey, I messed it up, didn't I? well, I guess we'll continue tomorrow, or the next day, won't we? keep your chin up. i'm still very much alive. and i'm cynical. we'll talk about it later. nite..

      I made friends with an ass. I found out that this person is a TOTAL ASS. Unbelievable. I can't believe how stupid I was. this person wouldn't take any responsiblities. she ran away from problems and easily blamed others. God. I was stupid.  I took my responsibilities. If I was wrong, then I would admit that I was wrong. I am not going to run away. I guess that is what makes one an older person.  "taking responsibilities".  She is like, 10 years older than me and she refuses to take her own responsibilities. she refuses to admit her mistakes. she just denies everything. it was like,  it was okay to point the finger at me and not at her. it was "easier" to blame me and not her. it was okay to beat me up and not her. it was like, i am expendable.  what kind of a grown person is that? that's what an ass seems like to me.  it's funny how life shows you its true colors. that's what makes it grand.

      Where are those pair of beautiful eyes that I once knew Where is that rare soul that I once discovered Has it fade away?  Where is the one-in-a-million smile that I used to love Where is the lovable crazy hair that I used to smell Where has it gone?  Where is that song that we used to sing together Where is that smoke that used to be between us Has it gone to the cloud?  Wish I could hold you tonight..  I used to love you.. Whatever happened to the rain that once brought you to me? Whatever happened to the world? Whatever happened to you and me?

      xavier was right. if i call myself mature, then i should check myself first. no, really. he makes good points sometimes. but i just wouldn't admit it. i was just so emotional the other day that i said something bad about him. i can't take that back but i apologized.  it's just that i have this wall. call it a defense mechanism or whatever you wanna call it. that's just how i protect myself from people. i don't let people get pass by that wall. especially people who have hurt me before. he had hurt me. deep. that's why i've built this wall. and i'm too stubborn to tear it down. damn, he made another good point.  maybe that's because he knows the 80% of my life. or maybe more. life is weird. cause no matter how i've fucked up, or no matter how he's fucked up, i feel that there's this string, this tiny little invisible string that always connects me to him. and no matter how hard i try to cut it off, it is always there..  and it's beautiful to have that kind of string.

      i talked to xavier yesterday. for some reasons, i didn't know why, out of all people, he always has a way to piss me off. i was so pissed with him yesterday. i was talking normal stuff with him, and then he started to dig some personal stuffs out of me. and he started to judge everything from his point of view, which is mostly wrong. i didn't like that.  i didn't want to talk about my personal stuffs with him anymore.  moreover discussing it with him.  he gave up those privileges the day he gave me up.  so i really did not appreciate him coming to me and digging into my personal stuffs and analyzing and judging me. i told him that i was not the same person anymore.  that there were so many things between now and then that he didn't know and he didn't need to know. that i've had a wall with him.  he didn't like that. cause he knew it's really hard to tear the wall down once it's built.  i basically implied that there was no chance in hell that i'm going to go back with him. no way. i moved on. and i'm happy with the way things are now. this is more like telling myself rather than a statement. i am better off without him. hopefully.   i really need to get my reality checked.

      "The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.  And don't it feel alright. and don't it feel so nice.  Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. Say, say it again. love will say it again.  Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points As I'm all by myself tonight not again, not again.  And don't it feel alright. and don't it feel so nice.  Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. say..  Well if you should nervously break down When its time for the shakedown, would you take it It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it  And don't it feel alright. and don't it feel so nice.  Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again Again. Loving again. It's coming again. It's coming again. Lovely."   Tonight, Not again.  by Jason Mraz.  --- i have been sick for the last.. 7 days. coughing like crazy. my whole body hurts when i cough. it's not a terrific feeling being sick. even it is just a plain flu. miserable. weak. i wondered what it felt like getting a cancer. or AIDS. or any other terminal deseases. must've been terrible..  since my parents died, i had given up my rights to be childish. and sometimes i just cannot understand a person who acts out of his/her selfishness. it's like, the world revolves around him/her. it's like, s/he's the only person who has problems. i do have my own problems, and i don't yell to the whole world about it and nag at people. it's just unacceptable. and childish.

      I deserve the right to have an opinion, dude. I have my own fucking brain. I am not retarded, I think I am entitled to have my own opinion, don't you think? I have never disrespect your opinions,  why did you? Do you think that's a wise thing to do? oh no, don't you mess with me, buddy. I might hate you for doing that.  All I'm saying is.. there is a vast difference between now and then and I really don't like the person that I'm turning into now.

      Do I feel inadequate? Am I feeling insecure? do I feel stressed out? I don't know how to answer that right now cause I really have no idea. Is it possible that I do not know what I should feel?  Maybe the devil inside me is starting to take a hold of me. maybe. I don't know. I should've freaked out. but did I? No. Maybe I just had too much of that caffeine last night. and the midnight reading. Did it make a point? Does it ever?  I think I just let a big opportunity went down the gutter. I let it passed. The so-called opportunity was standing right in front of my door and I simply ignored it. just cause I was too lazy.  a slacker. yes, I became one.  I was, and as it turns out..  I am always a slacker. I take comfort in this path that I'm having now that I refused to grab the chance. I refused to make my life better in the future.  I consider myself officially "fucked up". Sure, I don't regret things. but this is overly stupid. Gees. I should stop thinking about it.   Did I just choose the wrong path, God? Is there anything - any little tiny part- of you left inside me?  --- Let me quote you a song that has been on my mind these days. from the mighty talented Mr. Jason Mraz. called "The Remedy".  "...well, I saw fireworks from the freeway and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away cause you were born on the fourth of july freedom ring  now something on the surface it stings that something on the surface  well, it kind of makes me nervous who says that you deserve this and what kind of god would serve this?  we will cure this dirty old disease well, if you've gots the poison I've gots the remedy..  The remedy is the experience It is a dangerous liaison I say the comedy is that it's serious Which is a strange enough new play on words I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  the rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends when it all amounts to nothing in the end..   I won't worry my life away I won't worry my life away.."   A happy belated independence day for those of you who celebrate it.

      Someone said that I live in my own world, and I don't really care about what's going on with the rest of the world. gee, you don't say.. that's right on the money, buddy, as long as I am happy, then I don't really care about anything else. maybe I'm just ignorant. maybe I just don't want to deal with the rest of the world.  and maybe, just maybe.. if you're nice enough, i might invite you into my world. I know it's not pretty, but at least it's mine.  but, who are you to judge me? who are you to say such things about me? who are you to stare at me with that insulting look? the rest of the world isn't a friend of mine anyway, so why should I deal with it?  it isn't going to do me any good.  as far as I'm concerned, the world only brings people miseries and heartbreaks.  the one crucial thing I have learned is that I have to be my own fortress. I can't rely on anybody.

      The Olympics 2004 started on August 14th in Athens. I've always been fascinated by sports and its athletes. I used to collect articles from the newspapers about this particular event and especially the athletes who happened to win. (Ok, it came out wrong. I know they worked really hard to win. Bravo!) Maybe that's because I used to be an athlete myself and I know exactly how it would feel to be in a competition and win, or lose. This olympic I'm addicted to see "the guys in a really tight swimsuits" or what we call "hunk swimmers" cause they were just plain hot and sexy beyond comprehension. Ok, I'm exaggerating. A couple of names that arise at this year's olympic are Michael Phelps and Ian Thorpe. They are just beyond gods to me. The beautiful huge crafted body with a beautiful face AND a talent so up above. Oh how I looooove them. Watching them compete and winning is like seeing my long lost dream down the drain. Painful yet beautiful at the same time. They remind me of the person I never was and could never be. and they really rule in this life. I salute them for trying hard and getting everything out of it. For they are my heroes. YOU GUYS RULE!  ps. I adore you, Michael Phelps!

      it's weird how life shows you the better things feeling safe- adequate- loved. things are great or are they? is it only a facaud?  i've forgotten when was the last time i felt this accepted by this world. in the mean time, life feels good. for this very time in my life, i am taking my time..     Ridiculuous note:    I have never seen a woman so hot and energetic like I saw Beyonce in that 'Baby Boy' video. ohh.. that shimmering oil.. boy, did she show them..    Music recommendation:      - Gavin Degraw  - I don't want to be  I saw Gavin on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on the weekend, that guy looks really like Jason Mraz. Are they twins? Guess not. That was a stupid one. lol. But i admire this guy's energy. He has the aura of Robbie Williams. His eyes show so much strength and determinations. Good for him. He's doing something that he's good at and something that he loves. And the music is awesome. The guy's good looking, determined, artsy. What more could a person like me ask for?    - Hoobastank  - The Reason  They came to Jakarta on August 12th. Of course I didn't see them in concert, cause if I did I would have bragged about it. lol.    - Linkin Park  - Breaking the Habit  Now these guys are rockin'. Plus, the video is amazing. Amazing as in "reaaally great"    - Dashboard Confessional  - Vindicated  I think their music resembles The Goo Goo Dolls'. And 'vindicated' is neat-o. I might fall head over heels with them if they make good lyrics. I haven't checked though.  ---      Funny quotes:    I was watching Ana Nicole show on E Channel on the weekend, and I got some funny quotes from it. (hey, it's entertaining watching stupid famous people making fun of herself..)  "Is it Miami or is it Florida?", says Ana in a photoshoot in Miami. And the manager explains her that Miami is the  City  and Florida is the  State , "..like Los Angeles and California..", he says. then she says, "Isn't Los Angeles different from California?"   (duh, do you a brain?    ok. everyone has a right to be stupid. my bad.)      ---       Interesting quote:   ".. how two people can fall so quickly in love, yet are so completely wrong for each other. I guess it's fate's nasty side."  Ed Stevens. "Ed" Wednesday on StarWorld.    ps. I didn't purposefully using Ryan's title "Better Things" (sorry, ry) but it just happened that this title outlined my life these days. Props to Ryan. thanks for creating "the title" for me.

      My boss is being a jackass today. He wasn't necessarily one before, but today..  Another thought, Is it common for bosses to be jackasses?

       That action you did today was childish, man. What are you, 40? 50? And you're still pulling an act like that? (scoffs) hhh.. it's not funny, man. Not funny at all! Do you think you were funny? Do you see me laughing, dude? Are you just inconsiderate or just playing mean? Cause I can't see the difference, man. Yeah.. ohh it was so funny, I wanted to puke in your face!  I'm not going to fall for that old trick. If you're going to be like that then I could be, too. Do you think you're the only one who can do that? Think again, buddy. If you thought that you could mess up my life and walk away with it,    then YOU THOUGHT WRONG! I could make your life a living hell, dude. If you thought you could sneak in behind me to stab me from the back, then YOU DID NOT KNOW ME like you thought you did. I AM NOT SOFT AND SWEET! I AM PISSED!! I can be mean to you.  I am this and a lot more. Remember that, asshole. You don't really think that you just could do bad things to people and expect nothing, do you? I can do bad things to you. Don't mess around with me.
