      Let me stop before somebody lets me know how crazy I sound. I' m not as full of myself as I sound. It's just that people look at me and think that me being confident and secure means that I'm pompous, bitchy and egotistical. So, I like to play into people's misconceptions. It's a mind game that can sometimes backfire, but I like playing the role. What fun it is to pretend to be something you're not. It's like driving a  $500,000  car. You know you can never afford it, so there is no point in falling in love with it and trying to keep it. The point is to enjoy the experience. And, oh, how I love acting. I've been called manipulative, but I think that's just jealousy of my skills.  I can play a variety of ro;es effortlessly to get what I want, when I want it, no matter what it may be. I'm shy, so I hate bein' on a stage, but my life is my own personal stage, so I can carry it off. Anywho! I'm sittin' up at work, waitin' on my momma to come get me. I know, I know. A country club diva should have her own car.  WHY IS WHITE CHOCOLATE WAITING ON A RIDE LIKE A   COMMONER?  Well, here's a lesson for all you NC teens who have to go through the hell this lovely state calls   "Graduated Licensing".   Don't get two tickets in 12 months because your license gets suspended for thirty days. And don't try to hide the suspension letter from your mom and drive anyway. When your mom's best friend is GOD, lying ain't worth shit.  GOD LOVES MY MOM!  I can't get away with nothin' cuz he always tells. So my beautiful new black Honda CRV is wasting it's life away in my garage. I JUST GOT IT! OH WELL! I'm making 9 bucks an hour to sit on my ass and wait on her. My dad's older sis (Me AUNTIE!) got me a job in her office, so White Chocolate is now an official glorified slave. I do whatever everybody else doesn't feel like doin'. But the perks are: my own office, a computer (which I'm shamelessly using now), my own phone line, my own key, a stereo system, and that weekly $270 check. It's only a summer gig, but hey!  I GOTS   NEW CLOTHES! AND GAS MONEY!  A diva doesn't get everything in life handed to her. You may think otherwise, but a true diva slaves half her life so that she can sit on her ass the other half and make other people work for her. And that is precisely what I'm in the process of doing. OK!  I think I'm gonna quit for today. Don't wanna scare anybody too much. Since it's still summer, there is no real drama to tell. Well, yeah there is, but this is just an intro to my life. This way, in future posts you'll have a general idea of my level of insanity.  SO... GOOD-BYE FOR NOW!  Like a true Country Club Gurl, me and moms are headed to P.F. CHANGS AKA CHINESE HEAVEN! And just in case you wanted to know, none of my precious money is going towards my meal. I'm goin' to real Chocolate City, ATL, to blow this week's pay!   Check (HA HA) ya later!
