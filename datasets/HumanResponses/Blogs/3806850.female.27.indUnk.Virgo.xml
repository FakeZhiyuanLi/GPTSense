      I have been trying to find online photos of Yohanna House--this is the model that was named "America's Top Model" on Fox's reality tv series earlier this year.  In the last episode, Yohanna talked about how over the past several years she had lost 60 pounds.  She said that she has always been into fashion, but because of her weight she was limited in what she could wear, so she started working out.  I wish I could find more info about her because I think I could garner some thinspiration from her story.  Had a terrible episode of ADD earlier today.  Thank goodness I was able to gain some focus back and at least got several things accomplished this afternoon.  Not being able to focus is the worst thing ever--doesn't do much for my self esteem.  Speaking of self-esteem.  I was doing really good earlier this week.  Feeling positive about working out, losing weight.  Feeling like I could be patient enough to reach my goal. But for some reason today (probably because I weighed myself) I started to feel really frustrated.  I'm 5'7" and weigh 167.5 llbs.  I am still shocked that I gained this weight so quickly--about 15 lbs in the matter of two months and...I'm hating myself for it!  Motivation is so hard to come by.  I keep thinking there is going to be one defining moment when I'm like...all right, enough is enough...I'll have this great epiphany that will wipe away any feelings of hunger.  I wish I could hate food. I will I could envision myself as thin as I can possible be without making myself sick.  I'd love to know what's under all of this fat.  Really, the lowest weight I've ever been was 140 or so in high school...even then I felt like I had extra flab.  I'd love to know what its like to weight say, 120....

      I am now realizing that over the past several months I have allowed work to negatively affect other parts of my life--stress would lead me to overeat, spend money, become disorganized.  I had this mindset that I had to work late every night, that I couldn't say no to a project--which only left me feeling overwhelmed and dreading coming to work.  I guess its kind of like self-image--as you get older you learn to accept and even appreciate how you look, I'm now trying to respect and set up realistic guidelines for what I can get done in a day.And trying desparately to learn that its ok to say no without feeling bad about it.  Sometimes my mind starts racing so quickly and I get so ahead of myself that I get overwhelmed and just want to throw my hands up and say I quit...I'm trying to find peace. I'm trying to take things one step, one day, one hour, one minute at a time and to stop being so hard on myself.

      Mr. Cheater emails me out of the blue today asking me if I am doing ok.  I've run into him a couple of times over the past several months, but its been pretty platonic.  I certainly would be willing to be friends with him, but I'm not sure that he could do that and not push things over the edge.  Also, based on Mr. Soul Mates reaction to meeting Mr. Cheater, I don't think it would be a good idea.  I sense that Mr. Soul Mate would not handle this situation very well (let's face it, we couldn't even have a conversation about him).  These past couple of days, things are going much better.  I'm keeping up with work, staying organized at home and working out.  It's just so darn difficult to stay in control of my life--which, now, I realize is the result of ADD.  Sometimes if I think back through the chain of events--either thoughts or actions--I think I am crazy. I get off on these impulsive tangents. Like I'll be driving to the gym and all of a sudden turn in another direction and go to the mall.  Or, I have trouble going to meetings where my presence is not absolutely necessary--I get fidgeting, it seems like a waste of time, I can think of better things to do.  I think the impulsity is what causes the most problems in my life--because it usually involves eating and spending money.  I am frustrated with my diet because I've worked out the past 4 days in a row, ate less than 1500 calories and actually weighed two pounds more this morning.  I can't believe how much harder it is for me to lose weight now that I am older.  Back to the title of my email--I know that he still thinks about me and probably fantasizes about how great we were together. The problem with me is that I always had fun around him because he is a charismatic guy, but when it was just one-on-one, I'm not certain that we really had something together. And, I could never go back to being the person I had become--insecure, distrustful, etc. because of the lying and cheating he put me through.  Regardless, I hate the fact that I feel excluded from our mutual group of friends because we are no longer together.

      Plenty to do, but not too motivated to do it.  I am frustrated because the scale is indefinitely stuck at 167.5.  Its never been as hard for me to lose weight as it is now.  I want to hate food, but its so hard when I've been using food as a crutch my entire life.   I feel somewhat strange because so much has changed in my life in the past 6 months--new job, new relationship, etc. And although, I very well might have met my soul mate, I am somewhat sad that my social life has changed because Mr. Cheater and I had some many mutual friends.  Many of which still hang out with him on a regular basis.  Since Mr. Soul Mate is not extremely out-going and my "friends" don't seem to make the extra effort to reach out to him, it makes me feel like I have to choose between hanging out with them and him.  Thinking back, I kind of miss the days of going to the Rathskeller after work on Friday, but even when I don't have plans with Mr. Soul Mate, it seems I'm disconnected because I don't work with many of the people I used to go out with.  The interesting thing about Mr. Soul Mate is that he can come off as being so cold sometimes...he's very honest and very abrupt and I think this turns people off. I'm trying really hard to see him for who he really is and try to envision whether or not this is someone I could see myself with down the road.  I guess time will tell, but in the meantime I need to focus on taking care of me, not abandoning my friendships, and try to not lose myself over him.
