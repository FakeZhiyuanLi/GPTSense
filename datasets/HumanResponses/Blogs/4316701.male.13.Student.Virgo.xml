      Wow! I suppose I got through the first day at RBV ok. First period I have Kelly-Gillen for a Science teacher.. she says that will be my hardest class. I hope not. :-/. Next I have Keepen or Keepers or sumthin like that for a math teacher. He likes to lick his fingers before he gives out the papers (for a better grip on the papers or sumthin) ICK! Ok Next I have Ike for English. She seems ok, a little on the large side- but that shouldnt affect my learning. Then I have Spanish with Hjeld. Try pronouncing that o.O. She apparently rides her bike to school from carlsbad (not sure why but w/e).  Then I have World History with Mr. Bauer.. he has a daughter on the volleyball team.. and I think half of the kids in that class are on the volleyball team (ironic or deliberation -- i will soon find out). Then Lunch. Finally. Except for when you try to send the entire student body (3200 kids) to lunch at one time it doesnt work very well. So i waited until after school.. except I got a smoothie and a pretzel for snack. And then to PE. Hmmm I'd rather not talk about my favorite subject (sense the sarcasm there?).  And off to my 7th period class which happens to be an after school period thats optional.. all my friends get out at 2:30.. I get out at 3:30.. o well it will look good on my transcripts  oops i forgot to say the last class is Speech & Debate. With Andrea Miller. She seems to have a sense of humor -- thats a good thing. We are supposedly going to tournaments and stuff which means that there will be interesting blog entries on those :-D. Hmm what else happneed. Well the lockers are teeny weeny and we have to share! UGGH. I share with colin.. so we kind of made the best of our locker.  Well I bought a large binder with dividers so I would only have to carry one. But it seems like each teacher wants their own. O well. lots of binders for me :-/. So now my mom is out buying those things cuz my brother wants to go buy a long sleeved shirt at Tilly's (surf shop). Not sure why a long sleeved.. its the middle of summer. Whatever, hes wierd. Ok.. well I have people waiting to talk to me on aim.. and jenianne is bugging me about signing her profile guestbook.
