      This week have been a blur, though i put my best to put it all in a post. Well Monday, all me friends were bitten by the Monday blues' bug. All gloomy expecting a storm to come. I dont know why but I suspect there were sad because they did not understand the lab work we did, PRSP, programming, so go figure. Than I was bitten by the darn bug, coz SOmeOne maDe a dAmn Sarcastic RemaRK thaT reaLLY reaLLy hurt my Feelings, or well, the price of being HUMAN. The rest of the days when slowly as i took my CMATHS closed book exercise, i think i can score 8 marks..haiz..wished I hadnt made the stupid mistake. Following the CMATHS test, i took my communication skills 'email test',OMG!Hope i can score..Oh the horror of life.. Than our communication skills teacher thinks it's funny to have our next week lesson in 'party mode', with our presentation due next week. We have to organize a party..WOO HOO what fun. HAHA, the next day we had Computer Architecture Lab and I am able to install new hard disks..And windows..what the heck, we had lunch and continue on with our Western Dining Etiquette Presentation and same geniuses who does not know how priortize decide to go do their own projects which is due in like 5 weeks time instead of this project which is due next week. WHATEVER~!!!!. The rest flew like a kite riding a gentle wind.So long farewell adiou adiou adiou. Stay tune to the adventures of SPIDER-AZFAR!!!

      Emotions are felt by the heart. Be it joy or sorrow, Winter's freeze or Summer'sburn. I feel as if I am being eaten inside out , alive. Emotions resurface that i though to have buried and forgotton. I had a strange encounter with my inner demons. I was taking an afternoon nap, i dreamt. First dream i had was I was at KFCs ordering chicken and cheese fries. I paid 1.87 for it. Wierd, isn't that too cheap? Than the dream followed when KFCs home delivery sent me hundreds of boxes of chickens and cheese fries, due to the cashier stupidty. I allowed my family to eat the meal but having said that, the chicken and fries were gone in a min,all finish by my family, not giving a bite. I immediately lost my temper, started banging tables, throwing plates, i didnt care what it was, it flew, it flew alright! and it broke. Almost immediately my dream changed, I was at a family function, a distant relative's wedding, suddenly the conversational topic turned to me, everyone started asking me everything, be it positive or negative, again it happened, i lost my temper, smashed vases, push down everyone. Even though it was not my house, a house that belongs to someone I barely knew, I started to smash everything. That's when I woke up, strangely enough, I started crying and cried like I never cried before for years. I was moody the rest of the day, I didnt know why. Suddenly it dawned onto me, was the dream a reflection of my emotions? Do i need physological help? I guess it was my supressed emotion I kept over the years, Emotions of neglect, jeolousy, envy. It was just hard being me and that was no outlet, I cant vent my emotions on anything, I am just not like that. I was scaring myself when the incident happened? Now, emotions are gushing into me like a broken dam, how do i stop myself, I just want to be sane.

      I was born Juanda Azfar Rashad, later due to some arguements made by my grandma and my parents, my birth cert changed to Juanda Azfar Rashad Kasenda. I first saw light on 1 Aug 1987 and was born at Singapore General Hospital. I am fortunate enough as I had a great childhood. I when to Gongshang Primary, than to Pasir Ris Secondary Class of 2003. I was a red cross member during my secondary school studies, and my grades were as awful as century eggs. Be it the will of god or lady luck, i managed to skimp all the to sec 4. There i had my o levels, and sadly enough. Things are to bad to mentioned. Presently, I am in Temasek Polytechnic taking Diploma of Information Technology. Life is like a book, chapter by chapter it unfolds. Well, not be a snob or anything, everyone needs an output device to vent. K till next time Chaw!
