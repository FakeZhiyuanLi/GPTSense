      Okay so I am soo fed up with putting up with other people little digs and shit that I am really to the point that I am not going to deal with them. I got an email from my sister today - my sister lives out of state and is newly married (2nd marriage) She goes on and on about shit that is either none of her business or something completely crazy that she cooked up in her own delusional head. They start the email with "don't' take this the wrong way, but" - why not say - hey I am about to bash you, make you feel like shit, blame everything from it raining this afternoon to 9/11 on you, but don't get mad about it because I told you not to take it the wrong way. what the fuck ever - next time I see an email that starts like that I am just going to send it back to them (with out reading it) and tell them that I am not taking it in anyway because I am not even going to read the damn thing. My mom is notorious for this little intro phrase too - you obvioulsy know that you are about to say something that the other person isn't' going to like so why even fucking warn them I have a pretty close family but believe me they are fucked up - each and everyone of us I suppose - even me. I call my mom to bitch about the email that my sister sends me - now mind you she is sending me an email that is all stemmed from our brothers girlfriend getting pg - note who is pg here - not me! so why the fuck would I call and tell my sister than my brothers girlfriend is pg - it isn't my place. now if only the other brothers baby's mamma knew that it wasn't her business to tell either we would be all good. this is getting confusing isn't it. anyway - I promise we are not a ghetto family or anything ~ just disfunctional!!! So that is the start of it but then it goes to the whole we don't' have a good relationship ( apparently that is also my fault) and I have never cared about my sister, mom or one brother (they are actually "step" family - but we do not act like it ~ well thought that we didn't but hey apparently I doif you ask my sister) they she bitches because I am close to my brother now (my real brother - who is 3 years younger than me and of course there were times that our age difference didn't really let us be that close but we have always been close) unless you ask chrissy then we were never close and all of a sudden I am what pretending that we are close - what the fuck does my sister care if I am close to my brother or not - what is it any of her fucking business! I don't' understand it - I completely am at a lost! Now my dilemma is how do I respond! Do I email and comment on everything that she bashed me on - tell her to mind her own fucking business, that I refuse to take blame for the state of our relationship (or lack of) and unless she acknowledges that it is a 2 way street then there will be no relationship OR do I let it go and not respond at all and just say fuck it and if we talk from here on out great and if not oh fucking well OR do I send a short quick email telling her that I think that she was wrong, unfair and hateful at points but that I am not arguing with her about it. I think that I am leaning towards the later but I my childishness is really wanting to go point for point with her and just blast her just like she did me. she thinks that everything somehow revolves around her and that people should feel sorry for her. my mom just sticks up for her though - there is always an excuse for it and it is always turned to just be her feelings or someone else's fault and it is tiring. this I know is childish but I am so pissed at my sister that I don't' even want to go to my parents house because I am in turn mad at my mom. not mad really but just so tired of everyone letting her get away with it all and making the excuses that I dont'want to be around them. my dad has nothing to do with this but oh well he lives with my mom and she sticks up for chrissy! I don't know why but I just don't think that I can deal with them. just a little back round - my brother (the one with the pg girlfriend) is in Iraq with the army. My boyfriend goes to NY everyweekend for drumb corps (remember band fag) so I spend the night at my mom and dads during the weekend -- hey free food and not an empty apartment - anyway though I am so hurt and pissed that I think I might just stay at home this weekend in my empty apartment with no food I know it is stupid and not acting like my 25 year oldness but I am soooooo fucking pissed at my sisster. good thing that I didn't send the email because we would probably never talk again since I am so fucking pissed! this is supposed to make you feel better but really I just get more upset I think - anyway I suppose it is still therapeutic. I was so upset after the email that I called my mom crying (yes it was that mean) and I can basically guarantee that my mom either already did or will call or email my sister - not a email that is like "what the fuck" but an email of "your sister told me you emailed she was upset but I see your point" okay I am about to leave work and right now I am too pissed to think about it any more I am going to go read the email a few more times and then figure out how I want to respond. probably best not to at all - but believe me I would get bitched out for that to from her! I wish I was an only child sometimes - it is just too much fucking work putting up with family sometimes!

      So it has been a little while since I have posted, but life has been beyond nuts!    J has been going crazy - first she found out that she was / is pg - which isn't a bad thing although she is so young.  i actually think that she is rather excited - which is good ~ and i am excited , i love being an aunt. j has been stressing me out though because she found some secrets out about c that ended up being way way way blown out of proportion and made everyone stress and miss work for no reason at all.  but she is fine today and i am super tired from sitting up and talking to her at 4 in the am. but since i love the girl i do it.  also tired because the bf didn't get home till 2:30 and then talks to me.  i can't say that i min that though since he isn't ignoring me or not letting me know that he is home so that i worry that he is dead somewhere when really he is simply sleeping on the couch - damn i hate when that happens. He told me that B went off oh his gf - i guess because she wrote a note about somethign being bull shit because he wasn't home when he was supposed tobe - something like that. she he went off on her - in front of s and basically treated her like a child.  i would f'n kill s if he ever tried to do that.  first off i wouldn't bitch that he is only a half hour late unless there was a very good reason that he shouldnt' be - shit i am almost always a 1/2 hour late.  damn but anyway even if i did bitch or something about something stupid i certainly wouldn't expect to get reemed in front of his friends so i look like this little helpless woman that he is incontrol of - that will not ever happen b is such a loser and his gf must be too for putting up with it.

      I hate it more than anything, yes even more than chewing noices when you go out to eat with someone and they talk on their cell phone.  It is obnoxious that you have to listen to their often boring one sided conversation, the rest of the dfellow diners do not want to listen to it and it is just rude.  You are out with someone that that must enjoy your company enough to talk to you threw an entire meal, so why must you ignore then and let them sit there like a dumb ass.  The people around you at the resteraunt are feeling sorry for the poor person that must not be interesting enough to get threw and entire dinner discussion that you must talk on your phone instead.  You might as well say to them "I am terribly sorry but you are boring me to death, so can you please sit there and be quit while I talk to a more interesting person on the phone" AHHHH it drives me nuts!  There should be signs up that reminds these ignorant people that it is rude! Okay thanks for listening!

      Friday is here - thank god!  I don't feel like working so I have sort of just been playing for a while.  I get my neice tonight which makes me happy - I love that little monster!  I am starting to think that I would like to have a baby soon!  BF would never let that happen anytime soon though ~ his sister said something yesterday about him proposing in a year or less ~ we will see. Anyway back to the present.  We are still doing our challenge - loosing weight.  I really need to start being more strict though!  I have done decent and I actually think about things before I shove them in my mouth which is always a positive thing, and I have been eating less just by watching portion sizes.  Tuesday is somewhat making me nervous though - I haven't weighed myself all week - mainly because we are using my scale so I don't have one at home.  I am afraid that I gained - not sure why since I haven't been that bad and we even started walking.  I need to make a chart of what we do - go up, go down, stay the same - sort of thing. Just makes me nervouse I guess since they get to see it too. I think that we should start something that if we go up we have to put in money - like a dollar for every pound you go up - if you stay the same then you have to put in like 50 cents or something like that. I think that would work - I am just not sure what in the world we would do with the money Maybe use it to celebrate after we are all done with the challenge - when is the end of the challenge anyway ~ suppose these are something that we should work out before the "weigh-in" on tuesday! That is all for now!

      TODAY I DON'T REALLY HAVE TO MUCH SO I AM JUST GOING TO PUT DOWN A QUOTE THAT I RECENTLY HEARD AND LIKED A LOT  "WORRING IS LIKE A ROCKING CHAIR, IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO DO BUT IT DOESN'T GET YOU ANYWHERE" - VAN WILDER

      So as you know I am attempting to loose weight - now I don't think that I am obese or anything just slightly large and carry all weight in my belly which I refer to as my Budha!  Now I am not huge between a 12 and 14 - but I would feel better being about a 7 to 9. My gripe right now is I don't wear tight cloths I don't like to show the world my Budha - so why is it that women that are a lot bigger than me wear such tight cloths!  Is it like a contest amoung fat women of who can shove themselves into the tightest cloths.  Maybe it is that they are trying to convince themselves that they really arent'  that  big.  They are like hey look I can fit into a 20 - while the rest of us are just afraid that the buldging seam is going to pop and there it will be all that blubber just out there for the world to see. I just don't understand it - my Budha is nothing compaired to these peoples and yet I won't wear anything smaller than a large and still end up adjusing and checking to make sure that it isn't emphasizing any rolls more that it should. hummm

      Okay so I have this friend we will call her Terry - her and I have been friends since we were in 8th grade.  In the 12 years that we have been friends we as everyone has had our ups and downs, but mainly we have been the best of friends threw everything. Terry has a son that is almost 4 and the father is a worthless SOB that has never even laid eyes on his own kid - well this one anyway he has a few more from what I hear.  Terry just recently bought a new condo after her and a guy that she was with for a while broke up and she had to move out of the house that they purchsed together.  Now she is dating a guy that she basically stole from another friend of mine.  They have been dating for a few months - not sure how many maybe 3 or 4.  He has 3 kids and is not even yet divorced from the mother of those 3 boys. Well Terry is soo in love with Tim that she has basically just stopped talking to most of her friends.  I have tried to talk to her about this but really I dont' get a response when I try.  Now don't get me wrong - I am not saying that single mothers shouldn't date, that isnt' it at all - but - the kid is all ready confused about who his dad is and tramatized that the person that he refered to as "his russ" is now gone and they had to move and now there is this new guy that he sees (and yes he has seen it all) with his mommy!  That I have a problem with!  I don't care if her and I stop being friends, but is it necessary to destroy your son with your selfishness - I don't talk to Terry much these days, mainly becasue I just can't get past the fact that I think she is being completely selfish and not thinking of her son and that isn't the person that I have been friends with all these years. She gives me the guilt trip when I don't talk to her (not that she ever calls me) that she can't understand why I want to throw away a 12 year friendship.  Now those words have never come out of my mouth - but I am not friends with this person, I don't know this person. I hear now that he is moving in with her - she has a 2 bedroom condo and if I can count correctly that is 4 kids and 2 adults in this condo - is that surpassing the room occupancy code from the fire department or something? I need some help - so if anyone actually read all of this help me out.  How in the hell do you deal with a person that you were once great friends with and now you barely know.  I guess I don't see it as my place to tell her that she is f'n crazy and that she is going to f up her son royaly but I am starting to think that I am going to have to just say screw it and ruin the friendship to help the kid! Let me know if I am overanalyzing this and maybe just sensitive but I really don't know what to do and our one good mutual friend is to big of a baby to even voice an opinion - not to mention that she would then loose her ride.

      So I am still at work right now - great time let me tell you! I work in Customer Service so I have to deal with customers on the phone all day. Well you know that great old saying "Customer is always right" well whoever came up with that is a complete jackass! They are not always right and a lot of times completely wrong. I just had a call that was one of the other girls here account - trying to do the good employee thing I helped the woman, HUGE MISTAKE!!! I should have know that it wasn't a good idea considering that she is from the Northeast - not to offend anyone but damn people from up there need to start talking to Miss Manners or something. It can't be healthy to be that bitter and mean all the time. Anyway I was nothing but nice and professional to the woman and was trying to help her since she had no clue what she was doing and she snapped at me. Now this is when I hate not being independantly wealthy - if I didn't need this horrible low pay job (it isn't that bad, but I am not lying about the low pay part) I would have most definatly told her to go F herself. There is no need to be rude to someone that is trying to be of assistance to you - unless they are rude first and then by all means unleash hell on there ass, but just because you are the customer and you are supposidly always right doesn't give you the right to be mean. Someone should really talk to your mother if you are! Okay I feel a little better - hey thanks for listening, you really are swell!

      Well today we are starting our "Challenge". 3 of us are staring some what of a weight loss challenge ( urlLink www.onelesscookie.blogspot.com )  Not so much like Dr Phil or anything like that just something that makes us accountable for what we are trying to do. We get weighed in and it stays in a book for only our eyes - that way we are more accountable to loose since 2 other people will see if you suck and are gaining. The only rule is that if you gain the other 2 can then steal anything that you shouldn't be eating. If you are loosing then you can do whatever you want and no one can say a thing. I would like to loose about 40 pounds - that would take me to about what I was when I got home from basic training about a million years ago - well 7 years ago, but if feels like a million. I would really like to loose 53 and get down to what I was when I signed the papers to join the military but I am being more realistic here! Sort of excited for next Tuesday to see how we do! I am really hoping that I loose at least 2 pounds, wish more but that is the healthy weight to loose so that is what I will wish for - although if it is more I won't complain ~ keep you posted! Really need to start going to a work out class or something - something to get my butt in gear ~ we will have to see how the walks do us if J and I actually start them today! My brother decided to stay for a few more days - was supposed to leave today at 10 for Washington State with the Navy but since the dumb ass finally called his daughter after being home almost a week and a half he decided to stay to spend time with her - if he wasn't such a pussy and would have called to get her a week ago it would have eliveated a lot of problems. Ass hole - I am sure that my mom thinks he is just father of the year now but I am still convinced taht he is a looser and not really sure that he deserves to see her at all, but hey I am not her mom, just the Aunt. Boyfriend and I are doing great - this is band camp week so we have our house guests staying with us. I must say that Amanda isn't nearly as annoying as Erin was last year - damn that girl got on my nerves. BF seems to be getting more and more comfortable with the whole coupledome - should it has been over 2 and a half years ~ maybe the ring is on the way ( I won't hold my breath though). Work is sucky as usual - interview wasn't so good yesterday ~ haven't heard from the guy but I am supposing that is becasue I asked for too much money. Oh well - I would be worth every penny of it! I am sort of glad that he didn't call and say that he got the large salary approved - I would feel pretty bad telling him no after all that ~ but hey the second that I don't have benefits I would fall and break my ankle or get some weird desease that they name after me and no one knows the cure for until some Australian doctor comes and cures me then sweeps me off my feet to the OutBack where we will live happily ever after as he reads to me everynight so I can listen to that sweet accent! Humm nice thought! See ya later!

       well today I have ate a lot - breakfast: 1 mini powdered donut, banana lunch: pondeosa, salad w/ broccoli, cucumber, peas, egg, cheese, sunflower seeds, creamy italian dresssing; a littls scoop of macaroni salad and pasta salad; 3 chicken wings; a pc of zucchine bread; tiny bit of mashed potatoes, and 2 sweat-n-sour meatballs sounds like a lot, but i promise that they were really small portions - water to drink damn after reading that I really don't need to eat the rest of the day!

       Well I didn't succumb to the temptation of the fair food - which is my all time favorite, but a salad just wasn't going to cut it. I really wanted a bacon mushroom melt from wendy's, but I settled for a spicy chicken sandwich instead with about half of my fries - and when you don't eat the tips that calculates out to about a 1/4 of your fries. Had a Rt beer to drink. Monkey girl - if you read this I am praying for you! Good luck ~ please do not hurt or maim anyone! See you on Monday! Only 3 more days till weigh in! Bye

I had a salad with 2 cucumber slices, some red pepper, and kraft fat free ceaser italian dressing; water; and a cold banana ~ the banana was the best part. Get to watch my neice tonight so that should keep me moving tonight so it will be like getting some exercise in as well - so as long as I don't ruin it tonight, today has turned out to be pretty healthy.

       At about 10:30 or so I finally got around to eating my breakfeast for the day - a yo-crunch, same as most other days - fat free yogurt and granola cruchies Yumm - I have also had 3 cups of coffee this morning and about half of a 24 oz bottle of water. I sort of feel icky though - my tummy is all upset feeling, maybe the milk in the yogurt bothered me - sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't faze me at all. Not sure what lunch will be - but a buffalo chicken salad from Rocknee's sounds really good - to bad I have to work half of my lunch so I don't have time to go all the way up there to get one. Oh well

       ...how about a repeat of the night before...except less cheesesticks and add a granola bar...the healthy one.  And a glass of Kool-Aid along with my peach water....I think I need some more peach water.  Oh, and only 1 marshmallow.  It was a rainy day so I didn't go jogging as I had planned but maybe I could do a quick tae-bo tape before bed....

       Even though the salad that I brought sounded wonderful this morning - it just didn't sound good once lunch got here ~ I think that I just really wasn't hungry.  But then I had to walk by the junk table one too many times becasue I ended up eating 1 meatball, and some wheat thins with the cheese ball, and half of a plain bagle with cream chees - I know I have no will power at all! But it is torture having all of this food hear all day. Dinner and tomorrow will be better - I promise!

        Lunch was great but now I have terrible gas and trying not to let any out if turning out to be a greater pain than it really should be...   I also have eaten lots of watermelon today...it's healthy, don't be mad at me!!

       Well even though I said I ate breakfast so I wouldn't eat the crap, I still ate some - but not a lot. I have had about 10 wheat thins with some of a cheese ball, 1 bite of jello with a bannana piece in it, 1 cracker with a piece of cheese and peperoni, and 3 meatballs - and a 24 fl oz bottle of water. I would have to second Monkey girl's response that Puff needs to actually eat - if you don't you won't loose as much - your body will store the fat because it thinks it is starving ~ and what weight you do loose you will gain back super fast as soon as you do eat normal again.  This "lifestyle" change as Dr Phil would call it is about looking and being healthy not starving yourself to be thin! Okay bye bye for now!

        First off, I hope Puff realizes that she MUST eat at least 3 times a day!!!  In some cases more....Because I have a condition known as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, I am not so sure that this exact diet will work for me.  Once all my tests come back, my doctor will be able to properly diagnose me and we will figure it out from there....I just need to get my fat ass up some more and run instead of walk and do an hour or more of exercise instead of half an hour....   Ok, so far this morning, I have eaten 5 meatball, 2 pieces of cheese, a sugar free cookie, lots of water and I think that is it....  Ok, might as well post what lunch will be...I will be having more of what I had for dinner last ngiht which was pasta w/sausage.  Ok....bye....

       Good Morning all!  This morning my wonderful boyfriend made me breakfast - now this doesn't happen very often, actually I am not sure that it has ever happened, so please do not be too harsh that it was slightly on the unhealthy side. Cup of coffee with vanilla carmel cream and 1/4 of package of sweet-n-low, one eggo waffel with reduced cal syrup and 2 sausage links. I know I know sausage links aren't the healthiest of all breakfeast foods ~ but it is the most important meal of the day so I am not going to be too hard on myself.  And that way I am full right now and I won't eat the crap that was brought in for Becky's b-day.

       Well lastnight I was starving by the time that I got home from work - as you can tell by my last post, sooo I had to snack since we weren't eating dinner till late. So Justina, Steve and I stood around the container of potatoe salad and each ate a few bites, also had 5 saltine crackers. So it was snacking yes - that is aloud isn't it? Anyway I know it was the best, but it wasn't the worst either - At lest I didn't open the chip cupboard!!! So after our little snack we (Justina and I) went for a walk. We walked from 2nd street to 19th street to see our neice - took a break there for about 20 minutes and got a nice refreshing glass of water and then headed on. I have no idea how long the walk was (forgot to wear my little McDonalds stepometer - will make sure to do that next time) but it took us about 30 minutes there and back so I don't think that is too bad for a start. So we got home nice and sweaty (it was hot lastnight) and made dinner. We each had 1 pc of garlic bread, a medium size salad (you know in like a little soup bowl) with fat free ceaser italian dressing, croutons, red pepper and cucumber, and a very small side bowl of pasta (that I didn't even eat all of) So that is it - am pretty proud of myself and think that I did good. Especially with the walk - much easier to do when you have someone with you. okay - bye!

        Ok, for dinner Z had a bowl of pasta, 10 mozzie cheese sticks and 6 marshmallows and koolaid!!  Yeah, maybe not as good as I should have been though.  And I forgot to put the trash out last night too....oh well!!  I haven't had breakfast today but I don't see that it will be that bad..I am gonna grab some snacks brought in for Becky's birthday.

       Ok...well, this is my goal, since everyone posted theirs and I didn't yet. I don't have an exact number, I am just looking to be smaller. I want to try out for the  urlLink  Massillon Bengals  cheer squad...and eventually the  urlLink  Cavalier Girls . I really want to get into dance. I know I am 24 and way past the learning ballet, doing pointe and recital stuff but I have been really wanting to learn how and what better time than now with no kids, no husband and really nothing else to do.... So I need to jog a little along with doing my Kick boxing...I need some new sneakers....the ones I have are super smelly which I guess doesn't matter since I take them off and immediately hop in the shower anyway...I meant to throw them in the wash the last time I did laundry. Oh well... So that is me, Monkey Girl....more later.... I am not exactly hungry, I really am craving something to snack on though. I wonder if I can petition to get a few healthy things in the vending machine, that would be really nice.

        Well it is  now 2:29 in the afternoon - lunch has been over and I am now hungry! I have thought about it and I don't think that it is the subconsious playing games ~ I thinkI am really hungry! Note to self - bring pm snack (there isn't shit in the vending machine that is even remotely healthy). Now I do not want anyone to think that I am giving up - I am trying to convince myself that I am not hungry - I have drank a bottle and half of water already trying to accomplish this feat. Hummm just think of that tight little body that I will have - maybe I need some carbination, haven't had any of that yet today - Okay fine you talked me into it - Diet Pepsi here I come - don't feel too sorry for me, at least I can sneak a cigarette while I walk out there to get the pop ~ see 3 birds with one stone - pop, smoke, and exercise. Bye for now - as you can tell I am the talker of the group ~ sorry!

        OK I   MAYBE A PUFF , BUT DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK THE PRECIOUS PART IS DEBATABLE. ANYWAY I GOT ROPED INTO THIS WHICH IS A GOOD THING. CAUSE AT 218LBS I AM TIRED OF LOOKING AND FEELING LIKE CRAP . PLUS I HAVE 2 GREAT FRIENDS IN THIS WITH ME TO GIVE SUPPORT, OR AT LEAST SOME BLUNT AND HONEST FEEDBACK!! SO TODAY I HAVE HAD 2 CUPS OF COFFEE WITH SWEET N LOW AND CREAM . LUNCH WAS A GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD WITH BLACK OLIVES FROM SUBWAY AND ONE LITER OF WATER . I HOPE THIS WORKS.  I FINALLY DESERVE SOMETHING GOOD AND GOOD FOR ME TO HAPPEN IN MY LIFE!!!  I HAVE NOT YET SET A GOAL , BUT I WANT TO BE AT LEAST BACK TO THE WEIGHT I WAS BEFORE MY SON WHICH WAS LIKE 150. I WOULD SETTLE FOR DROPPING 40LBS BY HIS NEXT B-DAY WHICH IS IN MAY!!

       Well lunch is over - I was even good!  I had a Roasted Turkey breast sandwhich on a hamburger style bun with spicey mustard and a Dole pineapple fruit cup - water to drink. I already know that I am going to be hungry before I get home - and I have to walk before making dinner so this is going to be tough to not snack - I can do it though, I have faith!!

       So for lunch, I ate a 6 inch ham &amp; turkey sub from Subway with lettuce, black pepper, tomotoes and honey mustard dressing along with some more water...I kinda wish I had of purchased a footlong...I have a feeling my tummy will be growling before it's time to get out of here.

       Well - one more thing to make me feel guilty - soon I will be the person hiding under the table to eat that one last cookie - oh well! I think that this was my stupid idea! Day one and I weighed in at a whooping 174 (pretty sure that is my heaviest in my 24 years of living) and the goal is to get to 132 - so only a mere 42 pounds, shit that is nothing.  Ha! So the plan as of now is not to do a diet persa but to strictly watch what I eat and walk with Justina - Justina who weighs all of 130 pounds and has the tiny little flat tummy ~ I would hate her if she wasn't going to be my sister-in-law someday! The goal is that by the time that the 1484th makes it back from Iraq - I too will have the tiny little flat tummy! That means we have till March - which I think is ample time right?!?!? So if I post that I eat something that I shouldn't - please make a comment that I am a cow and do not need to eat that! Okay so far today I have had - 3 cups of coffe (2 of which had no fat cream), a 20oz bottle of Aquafina water, and a Yo-Cruch (mixed fruit and granola with 99% fat free yogurt) doing pretty good so far! Lunch is almost here though

       Well you should know that I did not succumb to the German Chocolate cake that looked so yummy! HOORAY - I do have some will power!!! Last night was J's birthday dinner so I didn't do too hot as warned! I had a Pepsi, 1 motz stick, 5 tortilla chips with spinach artichoke dip, a little piece of quesadilla (no sour cream though) - all that because my parents just had to have the sampler, then for dinner I had 2 chicken fingers with buffalo sauce on it dipped in ranch, and probably less than a 1/4 of my fries! So that was my dinner - It looks like so much since it is a little of a whole bunch of things - although I was so full that I thought I was going to be sick after.

       well lunch was shopping so I had some grapes when I got back then I stupidly I went over to where the food was - so I wasn't horrible and got half of a bagle but I don't like the cream cheese so I didnt' eat it all - I had 3 little pieces of cheese, 2 crackers and 2 little pieces of turkey. So that wasn't bad - but they have German Chocolate cake over there which I loooove.  I haven't done it, but it will take  A LOT  of will power. I am not sure what dinner will be - we are going out for Justina's bday so it could be bad - guess that means that I should really stay away from the cake!!!

       Ok, so i have a donut and some tiny meat circles and a cookie. I have to work out extra tonight because of it. My Australian friend seems to thing bulimia is the way to where she wants to be which is pretty sad. I wish she would just love herself the way she is. I wish she would pick a number and decide that is where she has to be. And I wish she wouldn't believe everything these superstars say about their weights. Besides, superstars can afford to have procedures done that alter their body weight, most of us can't. Ok, more later....still no clue on what dinner brings.

But yesterday for lunch I had about half of a plate of rigatoni with a meatball and a half  - sauce on the side, 1 pc of garlic bread, a few bites of salad with creamy italian dressing, water to drink then the world turned crazy and I ran around all day so it was about 9:30 before I was calm and in the same place long enough to eat so I had a chicken patty sandwhich with spicy mustard on a hamburger bun and a small cup of diet coke and rum - a much needed drink, and not too bad for you So far this morning I am on my second cup of coffee.

Sooner or later I will be all pasta'd out...This just shows me that I can eat the same thing all the time for a limited amount of time so maybe next week, I will switch to something lighter...Right now, it would appear that I was tr ying to become a foot ball player, lol....

       We all did great! All of us went down - which I think is wonderful and it will also be motivation to do even better! I lost 2 pounds this first week! 172! Yes I know still huge - but I am getting there. I know that 2 pounds is healthy to loose in a week, but that will take forever! But I am not getting discouraged - it is still 2 pounds closer to my goal! only 40 pounds to loose now! I won't think of it that way - seems like too much! So I will make a new short term goal - my birthday is in exactly 7 weeks ~ I want to loose 17 pounds by my birthday down to 155! Still at a healthy rate about 2.43 pounds per week! Still seems like a lot, but a bit more attainable than 40 pounds! So I will have to get my butt in gear even more - I have been doing good with the walking - maybe I will try and fit some workout videos into there too. Although I would like to have money to join the gym with Justina so that we could go to some classes. Also I am going to try trimspa - cheating a little but I don't care! I want to be less of a whale on my bday!

       I went for a walk lastnight!  They say that you should increase your walk by 10% every week or something like that, so lastnight we walked to 19th street again (from second) then down that street and back down on the other side.  Then we walked to the store that is near my house so I am not sure if that is 10% or not, but it was increased.  For dinner we had cheeseburger hamburger helper made with ground turkey and skim milk, a buttermilk bisquit, tater tots (baked not fried) and a tiny bit of cheesy broccoli rice - it was very yummy and you couldn't even tell that it was turkey and not hamburger! I had one glass of kool-aide and then half of a diet coke

        Now I am down to a whole 262lbs....lol...at least I don't have to pay....So, I went out yesterday distributing material for our program so that was my exercise I suppose.  K went out with C last night so we didn't go to the track but maybe I will just walk down there without her today.  Ok, since we were on the run last night, I picked up 2 soft tacos supreme.  This morning, 2 more low fat cookies.  Snacks will be crackers and water and I didn't make pasta so I don't know what I am having for lunch.

       Well I was bad today in that I didnt eat anything at all in the morning - had a bottle of water and 2 cups of coffee.  Lunch I had a McDonalds bacon ranch salad with grilled chicken and reduced fat ranch (that I had to get at Wendy's since McDonalds sucks and doesn't have any) I ate about 3/4 of the salad and then had some apple dippers with low fat carmel dip it was yummy! Tonight I am going on a walk with Justina and then I think we might have some Hamburger helper but made with turkey instead of hamburger  -  not positve though, depends how motivated I am to make it.

I plan on running tonight again and having more pasta for dinner.  I will try to walk/jog two miles tonight...My thighs are killing me.  I just might gain a few before I lose some because of the running, I hope not but it will even out in the end....

       I look like a pig because no one else is posting this weeking so the last few have been from me - oh well! Dinner was good - Dad made brautwurst on the grill and I made home made potatoes seasoned with basil, parsley, oregano, salt and pepper and baked in the oven!  Not to shabby! Have a good evening - Bye!

       Well I went form my walk which turned out being more of a nature hike - it started out on a path in the little park, but then the path sort of ended so we ended up on the little trails (if you can call them that) in the woods!  But it is a lot more fun climbing super big hills and a lot more fun tying to climb down them while trying not to fall on your ass.  Also the the jumping over creeks and trying to find footing on small rocks - but it was fun and a bit of a work out with all the hills ~ I should be feeling that tomorrow!  =) To eat for lunch I had a turkey sandwhich on toasted rye bread with spicy mustard, and yellow tomatos - yummmm with grapes  and a dr pepper ~ so I think that I have made up at least a little bit from my slightly unhealthy breakfast! Bye

       Well, I really wanted to eat the pizza but I knew it would add on the weight, especially since I am on the cycle so I ate a chicken salad with no beans from Taco Bell but I splurged a little and had a small fry from McDonald's.  I just couldn't resist!!

I know that I should eat more, but right now the grapes that I brought sound gross and I am too broke so I couldn't go and get anything - Oh well!  I will do better I promise!

       There is a pound cake sitting in the hall, just feet from my cube and there are kispry cream donuts in the kitchem ~ I think that there is a conspirecy to keep us fat! Anyway for dinner lastnight I had my leftover egg plant parmagan from lunch the other day with a piece of bread (no butter) with a glass of diet coke.  Had water to drink through out the evening! This morning I have had 2 cups of coffee and a mulit-grain english muffin with jelly on it also about half of a bottle of water so far. I am going to be strong and NOT go near the donuts or pound cake.  I am not hungry now so I might be okay!

       Lunch today was pasta salad with a few croutons in it and water - snack later in the afternoon was a peach! Now I know that it had been awhile since I have had a peach, but the fuzziness really gets to me. It is like I am eating a small animal or something and I am eating the flesh around its little brain.  It was good don't get me wrong, but it is a little bit of a disturbing experiance!

       I was in a really shitty mood lastnight and too lazy to actually make dinner, so at about 10:30 I had a small bowl of low fat frozen yogurt and some hershey syrup on it. I did laundry so I had to lug 4 laundry baskets in and out and up the million stairs to my apartment - does that count as exercise? Breakfast this morning was 3/4 of a cup of frosted flakes with about an once of fat free skim milk and 2 cups of coffee.

       Well lastnight I went for my walk with J - walked around the lake for about an hour.  After that we couldn't decide what to eat for dinner so we ended up just walking around the grocery store.  We ended up getting a Bruchetta pizza with portabella mushrooms and spinach ~ it was soooo yummy!  I ate the suggested serving size of 1/4 of a pizza (it is a some what small pizza) I wanted more, but I only ate the 220 calories and 10 grams of fat in the one serving size.  J on the other hand ate the remaining 3/4 of the pizza! I didnt' eat breakfast this morning because I was too pissed at my sister - but I had almost a full cup of coffee and a bottle of water. Lunch was at Cafe Pisacatelli and I had a side salad with Italian (the lowest fat content dressing that they had) and then I had eggplant parmagan that was to die for but I only ate half of it and brought the rest home - also had one piece of bread (no butter on it) and 3 glasses of iced tea. I have an incredible bad headache right now and I am doing laundry tonight so I haven't a clue what dinner will be.

       Our 2nd weigh in and this time around I am done 4 pounds!!!  That is a total of 6 pounds in 2 weeks - down to 168. I am very excited and proud of all of us - well both of us since Puff isn't here to get weighed! Now I am only 13 pounds away from my birthday goal and of 155. Hooray! Hooray! It really is a great motivator!  I did it last week so I can do it this week and I can do it better - I didn't get to walk a lot last week and there were times I was bad - maybe this week I can do just a little bit better.  Walk more and do not eat unhealthy as much!!  I did not stop and get McDonalds lastnight!!  I waited till I got home and then I had a hotdog with mustard and ketchup (didn't have any buns so I used the bottom of a hamburger bun instead) and I had some pasta salad.  I do not think that it is too unhealthy though because I made it with Extra virgin Olive oil instead of vegteble oil so I don't think that it would be too horribly fatty!  Breakfast today was 1 cup of cereal (Pops) and 2 ounces of fat free skim milk and coffee!

       This is exciting.  Since our weigh in last Tuesday, I have shed 3 wonderful lbs.  I knew I lost weight cause I hopped on the scale at home this morning, I couldn't help it.  I was just hoping it was totally serious!!  So, now last night, I had 2 more bunless hotdogs.  That was GREAT!!!  LOL, well, not really but better than eating a ton of food.  And for breakfast, I am drinking tea and ate a granola bar.  Hope I am down three more pounds next week!!

       So we are only 15 short hours from our second weigh in!  And now I have a delima - I am dying for McDonalds chicken nuggets - Dying for them!!!! Now I am working late (working hard arent' I ha ha) and then I have to drive to a class that should last till about 7:45 so if I am trying to get something to get to have on my way there and I cant think of anything!  Nothing that you can eat and drive is healthy.  I suppose that a grilled chicken sandwhich isn't that bad, but it isn't great and also I would eat the fries. It is just horrible.  I need a salad on a stick or something!  Is that possible - honestly what do drive threws that you can eat and drive at the same time that is at all healthty? If you think of something let me know - otherwise I suppose I will just have to wait till later to eat - although there isnt' really anything healthy at home either.

       Well had some errands to run at work so I didn't have time to stop and get anything for lunch so I am in the process of eating my grapes.  Not feeling too bad though.  I have plans tonight though so I am not sure what I am going to do for dinner.  The scrapbooking class is from 6:30 to 7:45 and I might be starved if I dont' get something before, so hummm not sure what it will be.  I am really craving McDonalds chicken nuggets, but that is bad! So I guess you will just have to wait until tomorrow and find out.

       When did it become acceptable with people with large bellies to wear clothing that showcased the belly and have their belly buttons pierced?? While enjoying the wonderful festivities and the beautiful people in Little Italy this past weekend (see Oink, Oink post), I quite often saw women with somewhat sizable tummies with shirts on that stopped higher than they should have been. I also saw a lady well into her 30's, if not 40's who while had a cute tank top/capri outfit was highly intoxicated and pole dancing. That was rather amusing.

       Went to Convenient Food Mart for lunch.  Had a Chef Salad (lettuce, turkey, ham, shredded american and maybe mozzie cheese, eh lets just say some yellow cheese and some white cheese and then I bought some swiss cheese to add to it) and a 20 oz. of Big Red and since  someone  thinks calories are so important, the only calorie intake I know from what I have had today is 250 for my soda and 160 from my crackers, actually, had less than the serving size so lets guess about 120cals.  And I still have a little salad left and I will probably have two hot dogs, without bun of course, for dinner which isn't bad at all, at least I don't think so.

       Well after my bagle yesterday we were busy running around and I never thought about eating until about 9 and then I was tired.  I was feeling super lazy so I told BF that we could have popcorn but never actually got up to make any.  So at about 10:15 or so when we were putting the movie in he got up and ended up making us his rendition of Bob Evans - so we had scrambled eggs and tater-tots (baked) with ketchup. That's it!

       So, I have been a total piglet this weekend!!!  BUT I saw the guy, Fredro, from the Average Joe Hawaii TV show at the Feast of the Assumption in Little Italy yesterday, totally cool.  I couldn't think of his name but I saw him and was like, I think I know that guy,  Hey, Punky, it's the guy from Average Joe.  Weird...OMG, so I totally think I might take up the crack diet!!  There were so many wonderfully put together(great clothing, great tan, great nails, hair & makeup), or rich, or gorgeous or all of the above at this Little Italy shindig last night, totally make me feel out of place.  That and not to many chocolates in the crowd!!!  So, back to what I have eaten this weekend.  Chicken gyro for dinner Friday and lots of Mohitos!!  And then we were hungry after a great night of drinking with the guys downstairs and made a run to The Border!!  Then, we went wedding dress shopping yesterday, stopped at McDonalds, got a 10 nugget meal again.  Then I came home and ate the last of the chicken from the wedding last week.  Then after Mombi finished with the wedding she was at she decided to stop back by and see if I was up for a night in Little Italy which actually would have been great if I was in the mood to get wasted cause there was plenty.  I still had a great time people watching!!  This morning, Mombi's future husband brought back donuts, which I had one and then we ate at the Bell again.  If I gained any weight, I totally know why and I totally deserve to suffer the consequences!!  I totally didn't watch the intake too heavily this weekend!!

       So I aws really really tired on Friday night so dinner was whatever I could get fast to lay back down so I ended up having a little bit of left over mac-n-cheese with a small brautwurst cut up in it. Saturday I felt like shit and had the worst cramps but was starving on the way to church so that wasn't helping cramps so I was very bad and had McDonalds - Sausage, egg, and cheese mcmuffin and a hashbrown with vanillia cap. Lunch was a "dinner" for my Uncle that we had the mass for (died a few months ago) so I had about 1/2 of a small lemon herb chicken breast, some green bean casserole, a roll, few bites of salad with creamy italian and then abut 5 pieces of rigatoni. I never actually ate a dinner but at about 10 I was starving so I had a little piece of frozen pizza and a few cheetos with a diet coke. This morning I had a bagle with peanut butter. Sounds fabulous doesn't it.
