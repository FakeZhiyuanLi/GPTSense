      Yesterday Derek didnt play, he had on one of those removable casts.&nbsp; He looked really cute though lol.&nbsp; Oh well we won anyway 10-3 against the bluejays.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea i know, not much competition, but a win is a win. Yesterday i had an eyedoctor appointment.&nbsp; O my gosh i hate the part when you get those air puffs in your eyes.&nbsp; She always catches me on a blink.&nbsp; its so annoying.&nbsp; But all in all my eyes were great she said.&nbsp; After that i went to the store to pick up a few things and then i came home and watched the yankee game.&nbsp; yeah it was pretty boring.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope today is a little more exciting.

      Omg, there is a rumor going around that the Yanks are thinking about trading Posada for Randy Johnson.&nbsp; ARE THEY ON CRACK!!!???&nbsp; I am so pissed off!!!&nbsp; i mean come on, the unit has like 3 years left before he retires and posada is just coming into his own as one of the top catchers in the league.&nbsp; As far as our pitching goes, well yea we do need more help.&nbsp; Mike should be coming off the DL any day now, i have no clue what Brown is doing.&nbsp; Jose Contreras, well ever since his family has come back from cuba, hes been automatic, i guess we really do need more help. But couldnt we give someone away besides posada?&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, i love Giambi, but he hasnt been performing lately, i think we could live without him.&nbsp; Maybe bubba crosby could play first instead of outfield, he has been a promising prospect (needless to say how cute he is lol)&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway i just hope these rumors are false.  &nbsp;

      This is a poem/song that i wrote a few days ago...   Ya know, its really frustrating How there can be so many men in this world and yet there aren't that many for me I walk&nbsp;down the street and all i see Is hands entwined, lips locked, mirrored smiles Maybe i should just shut myself inside for a while  Okay this is becoming a serious problem Look at me, i mean really look at me Is my hair not cool enough? Are my clothes out of style? Do I not say the cool things like other girls do? Maybe i should just shut up for a while  Guess what! Emotions Suck! What if i found a switch in my brain where i could turn off my feelers and just walk around like a robot Yea that would work for me I'll start lookin for that button right now Maybe I should just wait a little while
