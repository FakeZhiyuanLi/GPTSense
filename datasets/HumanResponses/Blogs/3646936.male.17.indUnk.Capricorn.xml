      Life is hard but i'm living. There is no way I'm gonna let this shit get me down it's not worth it. I'm almost over everything. I'm not gonna stop trying to get over it all. I've got to live with what I got. I've still got hope. I've lived on hope before and I can do it again.

      One, two and three remain the same this week with new entries from Ill Nino at number 4 and Andrew W.K. at number 5. Due to these new entries Q.O.T.S.A. and R.A.T.M are knocked out of the top ten. Guns 'N' Roses and Evanescence do not appeal to me this week and also leave the top ten. Metallica have moved up to number 6 and Iron Maiden stay at number 7. korn have slipped down to number 8 but remain in the top ten. Staind enter at number 9 and to finish off the top ten Beastie Boys join the rest.  So the top ten this week stands as follows:   1.  Linkin Park 2.  P.O.D. 3.  Slipknot 4.  Ill Nino 5.  Andrew W.K. 6.  Metallica 7.  Iron Maiden 8.  Korn 9.  Staind 10. Beastie Boys

       Enger-land, Enger-land, Enger-land, Enger-land, La La.   I thought we would win. Against a team like Croatia you can never be sure tho, but hey we won. Lets see if they can perform like that against Portugal.

      Well that seems to be the end of that. Seems that there has been a change in both me and Louise and it seems that it will never be the same as before. So, I shud jud try and move on again.  I'm now single and there's n that i've seen that I like.  Depression seems to be the only thing that comes out of relationships for me.  Maybe I am better off single.  Wot do you think?

      I still like Louise but I don't know whether she thinks things can be the same as they were before. I jus wanna feel how I felt when I was with her before. It was the happiest I had been in my short life of seventeen years. She really was the best g/f i've ever had. and I miss what we had 2gether. I know she was happy when she went out with me and she even stayed with me a lot when I wasn't too well at a gig. I don't think I ever told her how much I appreciated that. But thats all gone and now i'm finding it hard cos I miss the happiness I had.

      Here you will get to know about me.  I will hopefully post on here every day but there are no guarentees. Depends on my mood on each day. I will post about computer/video games, music, Magic the Gathering cards and anything that I can think of.  I will occasionally ask for advice on certain matters. If I do I hope that you will comment on my problem and share your wisdom with me.  If you have any questions just include it in a comment of this post and I will try and answer it.  Thanks.
