      ANGEL  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don’t think much about it anymore, but there was a time I couldn’t get it out of my head.  &nbsp;  It was a day I didn’t think I would survive, the metropolis of intuition that was vacuumed in my mind was endless.&nbsp; I wanted to get it out and fast.&nbsp; I hate myself when I am so inconsistent and incoherent.&nbsp; I am in a state that cannot be reversed or understood.&nbsp; I can’t remedy it.  &nbsp;  Sex was never as good with her as it was in my mind.  &nbsp;  There is nothing like cotton t-shirt sheets.  &nbsp;  I feel creative but can’t understand why.&nbsp; It’s been months since I have written.  &nbsp;  The sunlight wakes me again, and I want to die.  &nbsp;  I hear Massive Attack in my head…..the soft ambient noise in my mind that seems to always be there.&nbsp; Angel, Angel, Angel.&nbsp; I love that girls voice.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

        I understand  &nbsp;  It is defined by truth and reality, it is not the love I feel for you that is truest, and it is my action in response to that love.&nbsp; I love you because in china a butterfly flapped its wings.&nbsp; I love you because the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation makes me.&nbsp; I love you because you are whole and sane and so beautiful it hurts to touch you.&nbsp; I love you because at night your sweet dreams move your body closer to mine, skin touching for days it seems.&nbsp; I love you because when I wake next to you and the sun shines over our bodies, Mother Nature tells me this is the most natural thing I can ever have.&nbsp; Human life is but a mili-second in the big picture so there is no time to waste.&nbsp; In the morning you smell of sweet vanilla when I press my face into your neck.&nbsp; Your breasts curving so gracefully, I watch the lines of your body and try to memorize them.&nbsp; Your fingers so soft and strong…not to dainty and not to hard.&nbsp; It’s the kind of thing you wish for when you are single, or at least when I was single, and lucky enough I got what I wanted, no less and no more.&nbsp; At night when you wrap your legs around me I almost melt.&nbsp; Your sweet lips covering me like a cotton sheet of sweet desire.&nbsp; True is your love for me.&nbsp;
