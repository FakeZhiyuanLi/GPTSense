      Y'know the word they use, biatch? Well having just gone to the US for my summer vacation, I was amused at how they used it. I also liked the fact that my name sounded a lot like it. Being the dweeb that I am, always playing with my name and trying out new stuff to add to it or how to write it (viamplified, and my 'symbol' that goes way back to third grade etc.), I thought of VIATCH.  I'm not a bitch, but I can be sometimes (like every other girl). Other people have called me 'strong-willed', 'high-tempered' and the like. I have no idea if that makes me a bitch or not, but for the most part, I agree with them. Although, some people have called me 'the anti-viatch', 'motherly' (@_@) and even *gasp* 'cheerful' and 'bubbly'?!  Strange no?  Strange, indeed (weirdo ako!). And I guess that is the very meaning of viatch. A little bit of everything that can blow up in your face at anytime (yep, blow up..).  Taking the words of my dear dear HS friend Jendee, I can be "dumb but smart, quiet but loud..".  I couldn't have said it better myself. ^_^  HOLLA! (jowk!!)

        Cannonball  --Damien Rice   Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt Still a little hard to say what's going on  Still a little bit of your ghost your witness Still a little BIT of your face I haven't kissed You step a little closer each day THAT I can't SAY what's going on  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannonball  Still a little bit of your song in my ear Still a little bit of your words I long to hear You step a little closer to me So close that I can't see what's going on  Stones taught me to fly Love, it taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannon  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to cry So come on courage! Teach me to be shy 'Cause it's not hard to fall And I don't wanna scare her It's not hard to fall And I don't wanna lose It's not hard to grow When you know that you just don't know

      Why do some people have to be such   snobs  ? Yung tipong dapat nagsasabihan kayo ng ibang stuff that concerns all of you pero they keep the info to themselves?! Argh! Is it because I don't drink that much?! Geez..ang tatanga talaga nila! Hahaha! Stupid little pricks!   But it IS irritating that they can be such   dumb drunkards   but  still  get good grades... Why? WHY?! I don't drink OR smoke..but why such mediocre grades? heh...must be that I'm one lazy weirdo.. @_@  Hay nako..basta sakin.. kahit magkalunuran pa sila sa alak.. I still don't like them that much. Bahala na! Basta sakin, happy ako na meron akong mga good friends. And I never was close-minded about anyone early on the year.   They can keep doing what they do, and I can settle for simple a 'Hi!' when we cross paths. Pero I won't go to great lengths just to make friends with them if they're not willing to get to know US better. And I tried making friends with them before, I just ended up feeling oh-so-left out. Bahala na!  But don't get me wrong, not all of them are that bad. Sure, I got a few of people in their group that I share a few laughs with. Pero alam mo yung tipong.. okay sila pag mag-isa? Pero kapag nagsama sila ng buong grupo..hindi na okay?  I have no idea if I'm making sense. Hahahaha!  Life is grand, ain't it?

      Jars Of Clay songs fill my ears.. I marvel at how a mere sight of a person can change you in an instant. How a mundane and same-old day can turn into a special one just because of them.  ..lakas ng tama...  Mai is truly one of my lucky charms who shares the same state of being as I. Pero focus..focus...baka mapa-kickout ako sa Ateneo ng di oras niyan..  *sigh*  Pero seriously, I'm really starting to get scared. I do not plan to leave the Ateneo anytime soon... pero it is honestly a tough task to stay. College life is waaay different from what I imagined it would be.  Horror stories from my sisters told me that it was hard..but not this hard.   Math is a pimple on the face that is my Atenean life.   Atenean..I am..and I want to stay that way... Dear Lord..HELP ME!! It is so darn depressing to go to Math class..lalo na bukas..bibigay pa yung results sa 2nd long test... its sucks so bad. Goodness knows I studied my butt off..pero may kulang parin! What can I do? *sigh*  O..bumabalilk nanaman ako sa pagka-depressed..ang moody ko talaga! Nakakaasar! :P
