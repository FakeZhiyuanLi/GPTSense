      I'm cold. I'm cold because i can see how lonely i am since you left me.  I' never thought you'd let me dealing with the world by myself one day.  Losing you gets me weird. Physically and psychologically.  I am cold, i am so cold. And suddenly i am turning red and i am feeling hot. Sometimes i feel heavy, so heavy that i can hardly breath. This heaviness crushes me.  I am feeling really down, i am feeling lost when i take conscience that you're not here anymore.  Then i am getting euphoric when i think you're not really gone.   I think of you. I wonder if you felt that was the end. And if you fought to stay with us. If you fought to stay with me.  I am scared that you felt the pain. And i beliee that if you saw the death coming, you refused it because that wasn't what you wanted, i know that.   I can't stand anymore to hear that you were not happy. And all the images of you i got in mind are not sad ones. They are images of life, of happiness, of laughters. Because that was the way i loved you, and not like they want me to think you were.  I know you had difficult times though but i believe it happens to everybody. I wish i knew how to talk to you, and i know you neded me by your side. It was so difficult for me too when i saw you quiet and closed, so far away from me.   One thing makes me feel better about this. I know that even if i never said the right words, you knew it all and you understood me without me to say a word. It was the same for me. I could read in your eyes. I could read in your words. I could read in your silences. I knew. So did you.

       february 1995  I realize you left me. Two weeks after, already two weeks. You brought a piece of me with you. But i still can feel you through myself. In a way, you're still living in me. But that's a secret between you and me. One more secret between the two children that we still are. Cause we won't ever grow up. I don't believe i will ever grow up. I don't ever want to behave like a grown-up. I want to stay young, i want to stay free. And you, little brother, you won't ever grow up, that's a certainty. You are a lost child, forever. What i want to keep from you is your casualness, your youth, your childhood... and our memories : that's my most precious heritage.

      since the beginning of the week, i spent one hour every evening (while waiting for my love to have lunch) reading anything about j on french pages. it sounds like it's something difficult for french people to realise that we're not in 91 anymore...  that got me wondering a few questions :  - when will people understand that dinosaur jr was one phase of j's music and that he hs the right now to be on another phase ?  - why do people go to see a "solo acoustic" show when they expect to see an electric show ?  - how come people can write bad reviews about More Light which is one of the best albums j got to release ?   someone needs to be updated ? go to check  urlLink J Mascis  website
