      Probability of Life  To have life in the universe, you need a rare conjunction of many coincidences. Life, which depends on a variety of complex biochemical reactions, can easily be rendered impossible if we change some of the constants of chemistry and physics by a small amount. For example, if the constants that govern nuclear physics were changed even slightly, then nucleosynthesis and the creation of the heavy elements in the stars and supernovae might become impossible. Then atoms might become unstable or impossible to create in supernovae. Life depends on the heavy elements (beyond iron) for the creation of DNA and protein molecules. Thus the smallest change in nuclear physics would make the heavy elements of the universe impossible to manufacture in the stars. We are children of the stars; however, if the laws of nuclear physics change in the slightest, then out "parents" are incapable of having us. As another example, it is safe to say that the creation of life in the early oceans probably tool 1 to 2 billion years. However, if we could somehow shrink the lifetime of the proton to several million years, then life would be impossible. There would not be enough time to create life out of random collisions of molecules.  In other words, the very fact that we exist in the universe to ask these questions about it means that a complex sequence of events must necessarily have happened. It means that the physical constants of nature must have a certain range of values, so that the stars lived long enough to create the heavy elements in our bodies, so that the protons don't decay too rapidly before life has a chance to germinate, and so on. The existence of humans who can ask questions about the universe places a huge number of rigid constraints on the physics of the universe - for example, its age, its chemical composition, its temperature, its size, and its physical processes.  The Anthropic argument...  If Earth had been placed too close to the sun, it would be too hot to support life. If too far, it would be too cold. The fallacy of this argument is that millions of planets in the galaxy probably are sitting at the incorrect distance from their sun, and therefore life on them is impossible. However, some planets will, by pure accident, be at the right distance from their sun. Our planet is one of them, and hence we are here to discuss the question.  -Michio Kaku, "Hyperspace", Pg 258-259

      I am so relieved that CSE143 is now over. The worry lies on the grades i'll get :(  I have been watching Stairway to Heaven (got it from BitTorrent) Episode 1-8 and read the spoiler accidentally. Now i don't know whether to watch on.  I love the piano piece that the lead character plays on his piano- Chopin Concerto No.1 Op.11 - Romantica Larghetto... so now i am constantly practising the 8-pages long piece. Before this, I was practising Chopin Impromptu Op. 66. It gets really messy, but at least I enjoy it. I hope to be better.

      "We could imagine a world in which casuality does not lead to a consistent order of earlier and later. In such a world the past and the future would not be  irrevocable seperated, but would come together in the same present, and we would meet our former selves of several years ago and talk to them.  However, it is an empirical fact that our world is not of this type. Time order relects the casual order of the Universe."  -Hans Reichenbach, The Rise of Scientific Philosophy, 1951 The arrow of time is one that  cannot be reversed, or can it? What everyone is sure for now is that we're moving towards a "future",  one that is ahead of us, no doubt. Does anyone really have any idea what makes up time? Current knowledge on the topic is only a small percentage of the  big picture, at least to me. I believe there is more to it than just scientific explanation. One of the great philosophers once said that "you can never step into the same river twice." Time is just like a river. You wade in it as it pushes you along. You may trip and fall but the river just moves on and on and there's  no way you can locate the exact atom which just flow past you ever again.  Man is always behind time. Nobody is as perfect as to be able to negotiate and walk alongside time. None of us is that priviledged.  So the saying goes "Life goes on", it is with time that it tries to keep up with. As the Earth orbits along its axis and revolves around the sun, the source of life, so does Time. We are born in it, grow within it, and die in it.  It's so contradicting. It gives us a chance on Earth and then takes it away after it is done with us. Time is one definite  killer. A cruel one. It takes away the youth we have so much joy in. And yet, Time is an understanding one. It allows a chance for new lives to bloom.  Time sees the rising and setting sun as it plunges the sky into brightness and darkness. It ensures the dawn of another new day where it is of a new beginning and an ending of Yesterday, where Yesterday is just an embedded memory, either remembered or simply forgotten.  This is Time. Merciless yet forgiving. A great paradox in the Universe.

      Suddenly, the world seems so bleak. Everything appears grim. Another news of a youth throwing his life away like as if it meant nothing at all. Another headline about a   brutal murder. Tragedies in many nations. Turmoil. Betrayal. Hate. Failure. The world is in so much pain. It needs help, and more love to heal itself.  Life has lost its in-depth meaning to the general population, who finds more importance in seeking greater wealth in this modern era. Selfishness is a thick barrier encapsulating  the man who has built his life around materials.   We are aloof and ignorant at times, choosing convenient ways to shield ourselves from hurt. We inflict on other the hurt we want to avoid from. We sting others by casual remarks which we don't really mean. Sometimes passion catches us by surprise and plunge us into the deep sea of chaos.  We are hungry for success, always climbing frantically up the infinite ladder. When will it end? Society laughs behind you when you fall. Pick yourself up, they challenged. You seem to be alone in this world.  White...  ...But wait! The beauty of existence is unsaid. The hue of the rising sun washes off the dark sky into a harmony of warmth each morning, welcoming us into a brand new day. Treasure it as it is the present; it matters. What we don't realize is that the future comes to us a day at a time, thus enabling us to have a clean slate each time we arise. It is the chance to renew whatever hope that trails along each sunrise.  Somewhere in the heart of the bustling city, a mother and her daughter sits on a wooden bench places along the wide

      I finally figured out php diary! ^-^ Ahh how glad! Entering 4th week of summer quarter. can't believe there's only 6 weeks left to vacation and i'll be heading to Singapore on Aug 21. The first place i'll visit is Takashimaya's Kinokuniya and Mos Burger. I miss the stationery section in Kinokuniya. Then i'll go to Far East Plaza to get some hair/fashion accessories etc, a nice backpack for school - all this while I have always preferred shoulder-carry bags. I miss going for movies with my sisters, and spending late nights downtown with my elder brother and talking about life.       2004/07/11(日) ^-^  やっとｐｈｐ日記だ～ うれしいー！＾－＾

      Job Finding Club  Click on one of the links below to find out more..._  What is the CAPS Job Finding Club?  What happens at the club?  How can you get involved?  Success rate  Program  Topics in the order they are covered  Resources Available in the CAPS Job Finding Club  How to register?  Questions most frequently asked by job seekers  Application Form  Tentative Schedule     What is the CAPS Job Finding Club?  The CAPS Job Finding Clubs consists of a group of 10 to 15 graduating students, all of whom are seeking employment. You will have each other for support with the assistance of a Job Finding Club Facilitator and Career Advisors. This is a two-week program designed to teach job seekers the most effective means of finding work in the field in which they want to be employed.   The CAPS Job Finding Club is sponsored by CAPS, and there is no cost to the job seeker to participate. Students are asked to purchase the Job Search Handbook produced by CAPS ($8).    What happens at the club?  First you get to know yourself, through the eyes of the others in the club. These students will become some of your closest friends, strongest critics and most stolid supporters in your mission to find satisfying and gainful employment. In turn, you will find yourself supporting up to a ten people just like you; looking for work  Second, you will learn how to spend six to eight hours a day looking for work instead of the one to two hour average of most Canadians. In this process you will practice calling employers for appointments, writing a resume, and creating covering letters. You will also get practice at honing your interview skills in a safe environment, and learn about accepting rejection from employers.  Along the way you help others in areas you do well in and accept assistance in areas in which you need help. During the program there are lectures, exercises, and lots of time to go to employer interviews.     How can you get involved?  In order to be admissible you must have to have an employment goal and be:  • eligible to use CAPS services • registered at CAPS through our website • employable  • out of work • serious and ready to actively look for work • willing to accept innovative ideas about finding work • available 9am - 4pm; Tuesday - Thursday for two weeks  If you meet these requirements, you may register at the CAPS reception and fill out an application from conducive to a CAPS Job Finding Club interview. Bring a copy of your current resume, and dress for success. You will be asked primarily about your employment goals and what you have done to date in order to achieve them. The balance of the interview will be on the points above, and should take between 15 - 30 minutes.     Success rate  The success rate figures of Canadian Job Search Clubs are statistics, and, as such, open for interpretation. Facilitators show a success when a participant finds work within the period of the program or within 21 days immediately following the end of the program. This standard will include any job attained by the participant, whether it is part time, full time, casual, or temporary. Taking this into consideration, the Job Search Clubs have a success rate of 75 - 85% depending on geographical location.  If the numbers are broken down more, and you just count full time work, sustained for a minimum of four months, the success rate drops to 45-55%. Overall, the successes outweigh the failures making the Job Finding Clubs a useful tool for Canadians to use in their search for employment.     Program  We will be using most aspects of the Job Finding Club Method which is an intensive behavioral counselling program based on the view of job finding as involving interpersonal skills, a social information network (Jones & Azrin, 1973), motivational factors and the obvious need for job skills.   The approach is based on two main hypotheses that job seekers can function more independently and effectively in their own job search; and that finding employment is in itself a full-time job which is easier done with a group of people.   A two-week group session is offered. The size of the group varies from 8 to 10 people. Every day during the two-week sessions, the participants immediately put into application the techniques being taught.   Students learn to target the employment market, communicate effectively with employers, customize their resume, create business cards, and prepare for interviews.  The participants benefit from the direct support of the CAPS Job Finding Club in their job hunting and continue to benefit from the ongoing CAPS services once the sessions are over.     Topics in the order they are covered:  • Self-assessment • Researching employers and industries • Networking • Cold Calls • Resume • Information Meetings • First and Second Interviews • First Year on the Job • Other topics: recommendation letters, cover letters and follow-up letters, CACEE forms. The facilitator decides when is the best time to introduce these topics.    Resources Available in the CAPS Job Finding Club  The CAPS Job Finding Club provides constant support from one Career Development Advisor and all staff at CAPS, as well as the following tools to help participants in their job search:  • Career Resource Library • Interview simulation on video • Computers, typewriter • Newspaper, magazines, specialized directories • Job leads from various sources    How to register?  Come to CAPS to obtain and fill out a selection form for CAPS Job Finding Club. We will contact you for a selection interview.  During the interview session the counsellor(s) will explain the topics that will be covered during the two-week session and determine if the service corresponds to your needs. If you are selected for the CAPS Job Finding Club, we will contact you a week prior to the starting date of the sessions.    Questions most frequently asked by job seekers  1. If I take this two-week session will I still be able to look for a job?  YES. You will actively look for a job during these two weeks. You will have to make appointments and meet employers.  2. Is it effective? What is placement rate?  Since the opening of the first Job Finding Clubs in Quebec in 1984, about 70,000 people have benefited from their services. The average rate of placement is of 75% three months after the end of a session. In other terms, it's 52,500 people who found a job with the help of the Job Finding Clubs within the last fourteen years.  3. Isn't two weeks too long?  NO. Since it isn't a course but an active job search.  4. Does it cost something to join the CAPS Job Finding Club?  NO. The services offered by the CAPS Job Finding Club are free if you are eligible to use our services. All we ask is that you purchase the Job Search Handbook published by CAPS for $8.  5. Are you going to find me a job?  NO. The CAPS Job Finding Club is not a placement agency. You will receive the help you need to do an active and successful job search. It is you who will find your job.  5. Since I have already been to some of the CAPS workshops, can I skip some days when the subject matter is discussed?  NO. We expect every participant to become active every step of the way and some of the material covered during the workshops is modified or adapted to the group of the CAPS Job Finding Club.  6. Do I have to come to all the sessions?  YES. Attendance is crucial in the dynamics of the group and we expect every participant to become an active member of a team of job seekers supporting and learning from each other. Each participant is asked to sign an attendance contract at the beginning of the session.

      Academics: College & Career Counseling      6 Easy Steps to a Great Application  1. Don't stress! Get organized! The first step is to design a checklist and some sort of organizing system that could help you with the process. Different folders, spreadsheets, etc. could be very helpful.  2. Don't wait till the last minute. If you complete the application over the course of a couple days (or weeks), this will give you a chance to look it over and make any corrections to it.  3. Use applications online, such as the common app, but ALWAYS keep a copy! Many colleges and universities have their application on their website and/or they accept the common application. If for some reason your application never reaches their destination, then you will have record that you did send it and you can fax them your copy of the application.  4. Make sure you give teachers/counselors enough time to complete their part of the application. Most teachers and counselor require at least three weeks prior to the deadline so that they can complete their part of your application accurately and on time. Consult your counselor and teachers before assuming they will automatically write a letter for you or send your transcript.  5. Have two people read over your essay, review it again, and then send it out. Once you have gotten feedback from a parent, counselor or teacher, you should then make the corrections and send it with the application. Just as it is a bad idea to wait to the last minute, too many people's opinion can have an adverse affect.   6. Resumes and Activity Sheets can be great for your application. Including a one to two page activity resume might help the applicant show their best talents and attributes to the committee. You don't want to go overboard (like listing every achievement since 6th grade) but you should let the committee know what's important to you and show how it has shaped your life.

      The Washington area is a magnet for smart, ambitious young workers. Post columnist Mary Ellen Slayter writes a regular column for these professionals who are establishing their careers locally, and offers advice online as well.        The transcript follows below.   Editor's Note: Washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.   ________________________________________________   Mary Ellen Slayter: Good morning, everyone!   Yesterday's column was about the Annie E. Casey Foundation report that found more young people are "disconnected" these days, neither working nor in school. I was a bit upset with the way some newspaper articles about the report characterized the young adults in question. Mostly, I felt like the rise in the number of people in this category was due to a dearth of opportunities, not laziness. Did any of you read the study? What do you think?   _______________________   North Carolina: I'm looking to relocate to the Maryland, DC area. Do employers really consider people out of state? I feel more comfortable getting a job first, then moving. Is that the best way or should I just make the move and then find a job?   Mary Ellen Slayter: It depends on the type of job you're looking for. Generally, the more high-level the position, the harder it will be to find a job AND the more likely employers will consider out-of-state candidates, so in that case, I would recommend searching from there. If you're looking for, say, admin work, you could more easily get away with moving here without a job already lined up. Make a few phone calls to recruiters in the area and see what the prospects look like in your field.   _______________________   Blogs as writing samples: What's your take on this? If, say, my blog caters more to the field I'm interested in (travel journalism - I kept a blog for a year while living abroad) than my academic writing samples, how do you think a potential employer would react?   Mary Ellen Slayter: I'd say you better make d*mn sure you've never said anything on your blog that might offend a prospective employer. Watch the ewwwwwwww factor. If your blog contains a lot of personal details about your love life and such, I'd be hesitant to advertise it. Ultimately, the blog, I think, could be a cool thing to bring up in an interview, especially if you designed the site yourself and the writing is professional quality, but I wouldn't rely on it as my formal writing sample.   _______________________   queens, new york: Dear Mary Ellen -   I moved to NYC to start a new job at the beginning of May. For the past few weeks, I have already started to feel burned out, but I don't even know why. I like the people, I find the work very interesting and it makes good use of my degrees. But I feel physically tired when I get up to go to work, whether I sleep a lot or not, and headachy and weepy at times. Any advice on how to better examine the situation and how to go about fixing it? Thanks.   Mary Ellen Slayter: I'd start with a good basic checkup with a doctor, to rule out any physical problems that could be dragging you down.   However, I suspect it's just the transition into the daily grind/routine of New York. You haven't been there long. Basically, just long enough that the thrill of moving to a new city and getting a new job has worn off, revealing how tired all that excitement can make you.   Make sure you get enough sleep, exercise and good food, and just ride it out for a few more months.   _______________________   Washington, DC: Graduating college is difficult because you are going from the peak of your intellectual identity, where you write hundred page papers and are expected by professors to submit the most flawless work. Then, as you enter the job market, you have to act enthusiatic about answering the telephone and filing mail, just to get you foot in the door. So i think that graduates today aren't lazy at all, in fact the opposite. With so many more people graduating college, you have to work harder just to compete for the admin. asst. jobs.   Mary Ellen Slayter: I don't think young people are lazy either. I think sometimes our expectations about what life is like after graduation are totally off the mark, but that's another matter.   _______________________   St. Louis, MO: I thought the article did a good job of outlining the reasons why many of these "disconnected" youth are not in the workplace. I wouldn't limit their absence to lack of work opportunities, but the expense of school. Higher education costs are out of control and not getting any better. And, for those who are educated, there is an increasing pressure to attend graduate school at astronomical costs (i.e. I am a typical DC gov't attorney w/$150K in student loan debt).   Mary Ellen Slayter: Exactly! Student loan burdens have been skyrocketing over the past 15 years, to cover ridiculous increases in tuition. It's especially bad lately as state governments have made deep cuts into higher education funding to balance lopsided budgets. Guess who pays for these "savings"? We do, in the form of higher student loan payments for the first 20 years of our careers. Some "savings," huh?   _______________________   Silver Spring: I'm sure you've answered this before.....but what is Agronomy? I see that is what your degree was in. What sort of classes do you take in that program? Just curious.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Agronomy is soil science. I studied dirt. We have very good dirt in Louisiana!   I was interested in environmental science, and the agronomy program was the best way to study wetlands at LSU. I took a lot of chemistry and statistics classes. I also got to spend a lot of time hanging out in the Gulf of Mexico. For a good part of my senior year, my classes involved going out in boats every weekend. My mother would tell people I was majoring in "fishing."   _______________________   Blog as writing sample: I would be concerned if a prospective employee considered a diary entry to be a professional writing sample, because many blogs are just that, a personal diary. If the candidate wanted to use the blog as an inspiration for a piece, by all means. But a blog as a final product would make me re-consider a candidate.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Yeah, that's what I am thinking, too. Some blogs are so well-written that they are elevated to the level of "serious" writing, but those usually involve a layer of editing.   _______________________   Pentagon City, VA: How does one break out of the admin cycle? I've been working as an admin for the past 8 years while putting mysef through college part-time. I will finally graduate in the spring and am wondering how to best find a job in another line of wrok when all of my experience has been as an admin. assistant? I have complete respect for admins and the work that we do, however, now that I am finally approaching graduation, I would like to seek new opportunities. It seems that having "admin" on your resume is like a brand and it is very tough to get people to consider you for anything else.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Well, the first question is what kind of work DO you want to do? Between now and graduation you need to make some decisions about your focus, and line up an internship or two. The truth is, though, that the jobs that most recent college grads are qualified for are essentially admin work.   _______________________   Arlington, VA: As someone who spent the last nine years working on her undergraduate and graduate degrees as a 20-30 something, I have noticed that the expectations of "traditional" college students have of the working world are often unrealistic. Many expect outrageous salaries and don't realize that most employers will start you as low as possible. Also, some have really pompous attitudes about what kind of work they absolutely will not do, and in hearing them talk, I know the jobs they want are going to require some of that "scut work" to get where they eventually want to be. As difficult as college can be, the real world is much harder. No wonder I've seen a lot of regular college students roll right into graduate school after their first 4 years---keeps 'em away from the realities for a bit longer.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Sometimes it's entitlement, sometimes it's fear.   Also, we have to consider where they got the information about what salaries and job conditions to expect. TV, movies, etc. sure aren't accurate.   _______________________   Bethesda, MD: I read the report. I do feel opportunities exist but the disconnected youth do not know how to access them   Mary Ellen Slayter: Very good point. Especially for the most at-risk kids, there's a real shortage of role models to guide them through this transition. Even filling out the financial aid forms can seem daunting to a 17-year-old, no matter how motivated they are.   _______________________   admin again: That's the problem! - I can't be an intern because I need to support myself. People that have to put themselves through college are at a very big disadvantage to studetns whose parents support them. I am already behind the game because it's taken me so long to get through school part-time, not to mention I'm pretty exhausted. I can't just quit my job for an internship that pays nothing or minimum wage. If I could, I wouldn't be in this situation. I even realize I'm quite lucky because my company now only hires admins with degrees already. I got my job years ago when the job economy was hot. I probably couldn't even get my job in today's market.   I'd like to work in intelligence, perhaps the CIA or FBI. I work for an intelligence analyst now and have a clearance.   Mary Ellen Slayter: One, an internship isn't necessarily unpaid, but I hear you about the disadvantage that system puts poor/working class students at.   If you have a good relationship with your supervisor, talk to him or her! Say, hey, I am graduating next year and here's what I am interested in doing after that. What do you think I need to do to make this happen?   _______________________   Metro Area: I have received 2 job offers after a long serach. While I am very relieved, I now have the unpleasant task of turning someone down that I received a written offer from. I wanted to take the job but the second offer was better. How should I go about this when they fully expect me to accept.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Politely and quickly. And in writing.   _______________________   Admin Cycle: A great way to break out of the admin cycle and get substantial experience in your area is to work for a non-profit. I've found that many non-profits and associations (there are a gazillion in DC and VA) hire relatively new grads because the salary is usually pretty low, but the up side is that you get way more responsibility right off the bat. For instance, I had a poli sci degree and got hired as a "Manager of Public Awareness" for a 12-person nonprofit. Manager sounds great on a resume, and my responsibilities were large (but nothing I couldn't handle). Then, 2 years later, I could put "handled all public awareness activities for national association" on my resume and it was a great stepping stone up the ladder.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Good suggestion!   _______________________   Washington, DC: Hi Mary Ellen!   I'm looking to leave my awful teaching job here in D.C. for a school in the suburbs, and I'm already had four interviews, and have another lined up for Wednesday. Yay! Some of the schools, though, indicated that I should "be in touch" so I'm wondering how long I should wait before contacting them. Also, I've really liked all the schools, but two more than the others. If a school should (hopefully!) offer me a job, can I ask for a day or two to think about it? I want to make sure I'm making the right decision, but I don't want to seem uninterested. Thanks for your help!   Mary Ellen Slayter: Immediately after the interview, send thank-you notes to the people you met with. Then check in after a week, maybe?   Yes, you should be able to take a few days to consider an offer.   _______________________   Silver Spring, MD: Financial aid forms, I have a friend whose father refused to fill out his part. She eventually took night classes at community college, but does not have a bachelor's degree. Parents should not be able to keep their youth out of college! But as Alfred Lubrano pointed out, some parents really want to do that. PS-thank you so much for having him recently!   Mary Ellen Slayter: He is the awesom-est, isn't he?   _______________________   Re: your financial aid comment: Besides making confusing forms, the FAFSA bunch has not kept up with the times in regard to who pays for college. Most financial aid offices are required to include your parents' financial info until you are 23 or 24 even if your parents are not helping you pay for college. This gives financial aid officers a skewed view of how much a student can afford out of pocket.   Mary Ellen Slayter: Right. But I also see why schools do this. Otherwise, I'm sure you'd have tons of middle and upper-class kids claiming their parents don't give them any money.   _______________________   Our viewpoint: As a 20-something recent college graduate, I know that my friends and I were all disillusioned. This was because we graduated from a top school, where all of us had held leadership positions and internships that gave us a great deal of responsibility. To go from running a group of 100+ volunteers or managing your own internship projects, to answering phones and ordering supplies, is indeed a huge letdown. I actually think high school and colleges help contribute to the problem because activities and internships are beaten into your head so that you "succeed" and "get a good job after graduation". But since everyone else does it, there's no competitive advantage and you end up competing with similarly highly talented people for the same assistant positions. What most people my age don't realize is that even if you are stuck in a job like that, it's up to YOU to improve your lot and try to get ahead. It's those that just complain that make us look whiny and too big for our britches. Just my opinion. . .   Mary Ellen Slayter: Very, very good points.   _______________________   recent graduates: I haven't read the report that you cited in Sunday's article, but I'd be curious to see what they say young adults ARE doing. From my perspective, I wonder whether many of the starter "jobs" available nowadays get tracked by traditional employment records that are kept by the gov. and business types. So many people right out of college (and grad school) are working internships, fellowships, contract employment - a lot of that stuff just doesn't show up in statistics as being employed. For example, for 2 1/2 years after receiving my masters degree I was employed through various fellowship programs....1 1/2 years of that was actually a real job that was just called a fellowship (it was easier for the employer to bring me on as a fellow, but I had the same exact responsibilies as a real employee). However, I don't think that I actually showed up in federal job statistics as 'employed' - if I had been laid off, I couldn't collect unemployment...and it had all sorts of weird tax implications. I didn't have a permanent job in my field with benefits until I was 29, even though I'd been working since I've was out of college at age 21 - probably had less than 6 weeks of down time (no work or school) during that 8 year period, which encompassed about 12 different jobs, internships, or fellowships in 6 states.   Mary Ellen Slayter: The report did not limit its data to the unemployment figures to track whether young people worked. There are other measures. As I pointed out in the column, this group is the hardest to track unemployment for, since it's not like they had jobs to begin with.
