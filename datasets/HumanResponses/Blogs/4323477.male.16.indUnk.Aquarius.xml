						   The wind tugs his Blue hair slightly to the side but his Piercing blue-black eyes kept focused on his target, A dragon whelp. He picked his staff up and waved it at the dragon, The tiny orb at the edge of the staff sparkled and A giant wave of water appeared behind him. "Too bad I didn't get to know him very well..." He said, Flipping into the air and making a surfboard out of ice.He hopped on the board and landed on the wave. The dragon cried out in a moan of defeat and Evaporated into a gust of smoke just as the water hit him. In the smoke a small Crystal appeared and he jumped up to grab it. The crystal shimmered in his hand and put it in his robe pocket."Deera's crystal.1 down, 2 to go.And then I can Learn how to summon, A GREAT ELEMENTAL!!!!"
