      So many things I could talk about today. Didn't get to talk to my Daddy, left him a message though. Spent the day with minime asking where her Dad was and why he was taking so long to see her. But made her smile and feel special no matter what. Talked to a few people today, old friends, new friends, special people.  I am sooooooo proud of my friend Sean for his marathon run today!! YAY!!!! I better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or I will never keep up hahaha.  So I was thinking (yeah yeah today I actually DID think) the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow. If energy can never be destroyed..maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you. Likewise the bad energy too...meh...never know huh? Was an interesting thought though. I think I will eat something really bad for me now so I can have freaky dreams and write another interesting blog in the morning... MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!  Cheers!

      when I was hanging out with Dino. We were talking about the higher quality of Greek leather...well he was I was pretending I thought he was right. He was going on about how they make good belts. ( I think he had been awake for something like 49 hours at this point meeting a work deadline ) I was thinking "Yannow...I have heard about a lot of things from Greece don't think belts were in that list" Sometimes I think...nahhhhhh I NEVER think...muahahahahahaaa. Holy molaaaaay I need more coffee or a brain or a Greek Belt?  Cheers

      Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along. The WB's Superstar USA, ooooh man I LOVE that show. An underhanded and mean reality show that takes AWFUL singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international TV. The cast members they chose were perfect Tone-Loc, Vitamin C and a guy named Briggs. Their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive. So they take them to Hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing..badly. The final 4 were well chosen Jo-Jo who told people it was his "gah-dunk-a-dunk" that made him star material. (that means his butt for those not in the know **wink**) Mario who must weigh all of 90 pounds soaking wet and looks like the kids who used to get shoved in lockers in high school. Jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size. Rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there. I do have to admire all the entertainers confidence in themselves albeit a lil misguided. I missed the last show because someone special was getting her swimming badge and have tried to find more info on how the show went down. A few comments here and there online only to find that JAIME WON!!! UGHHHH!!! NOOOOOOO!!!! For gawd sakes do we NOT have enough female pop-TARTS out there these days?? Yes her looks will sell her to the male audiences even if she can't sing. I think we needed someone like Mario to give all those male singers a run for their pec and chin implants. Rosa well....yeah the worst singer but she didn't have the spark and she can't shake it like J-Lo and Aguilera. Jo-Jo was just too sweet I think, or too simple....I dunno one or the other. Apparently it works for a woman but not for a man. Yay Jaime you have just become a part of the machine that is stardom,but for the love of all that is sacred someone give her cue cards so she can stop writing lyrics on her hands!!!  Cheers!

      We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation, but how does that really affect us? All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's. A couple thousand years ago 30 really was middle age and 60 was as old as 90 is today. Always searching for the youth, the secret of eternal life....dealing with a whole other area of medicine that will become the focus of all our healthcare dollars even more so..."Geriatrics" I love my lil grandma dearly but it is so hard to watch her age, she was born in 1918 the year Influenza B swept across North America and killed so many. Indeed her own mother became very ill when my grandma was only a few months old. Grandma was sent to stay with Aunt Lizzie till her Ma was better. She managed to stay well through that. She also managed to survive as one of the middle children in a family of 9 kids. In a house with no running water. I think about how my child will never know what it's like to have to live with an outhouse and baths in the kitchen(well those ones in the sink when she was 6 months old were cute hehe). My grandma married a man 12 years her senior whom was the love of her life....brought 4 kids into this world on Dairy Farms. Worked hard..watched her family grow...watched my grandfather grow more and more ill after he retired and take care of him like a nurse after his many strokes. He passed away in 1988 and she has never even considered another man. Then her energy was directed back to her kids and grandkids, and most importantly her garden. That woman has more strength and courage than most of the people I know. And as I watch her health start to fail at the age of almost 86...I find myself dealing with the one of the hard truths of life. We all will die one day. So I am not sure if I am more upset at the fact she will not be here forever...or the fact that I won't. I need coffee...Cheers!

      There are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to. Sometimes my ideas seem profound, sometimes just plain funny....maybe getting it all out there and have someone stumble across them and maybe laugh, maybe cry, maybe learn something...might be a good idea. Or I can just pretend people actually are interested in my errant rantings now and then. So I raise a glass of....hrmm...water? and say Cheers!  Webi

      that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee. Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wienerrrrrrrr....everybody'd be in love with me.   I treated myself today to some dresses, I felt so gross the last week. I realized I had only one really "pretty" dress..I am a girl I guess I can act like one once in a while instead of feeling like I have to be some plain non descript blending into the crowd figure. I'd like to be able to look in the mirror and say "Daaaamn I look GOOD!" and really think it. For all my bravado about not caring what other people think about my looks...I need to be less critical about what I think of them. I know the really good stuff is on the inside, I know how to love, I know how to care, I know how to make others feel appreciated...But I live in a culture that has ingrained into my being this myth about beauty. I did some reading a few nights about about body image and older civilizations...dammit if I lived in the time of Reuben...I'd be a SuperModel...lol. We are taught young to find fault with ourselves...our lack of looking like that less than 1% of women who actually do model. I still find it so bizarre they use women we can never be instead of the women we are to sell us things. There would be something self satisfying to see more women just like us model...or models chosen on the basis of their deeds...cause in the end it's how good you WERE not how good you LOOKED.   &nbsp;  I had more to say but I got distracted, so yeah then I guess I am done for now.   Cheers!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      that's all i want to say to youuuuu.  &nbsp;  Ok maybe not just that. I got a lot done today, fever seems to be almost gone. Had most of the day to myself which was kind of nice. Did some yard work,a lot of&nbsp;cleaning, some resting...then got a phone call that my precious was not comfy where she was having a sleep over and wanted to come home. That's ok though we can try another time.  &nbsp;  I'm a little nervous about going back to work, but I still have a bit more time. I will go back to needing to catch up on so much and take account for the time and targets I missed. I think it's going to be ok, I feel like i have a better sense of purpose now. Maybe I just need to get primal and kill that fear. Funny how a slight change in the way you perceive something can shift you to a whole other view.&nbsp; Although I don't think being painted up in tribal colors and jumping on the desks will go over well at work...ooooh wait that's right METAPHORICAL...lol  &nbsp;  Ok I am done..nothing else to say today.  &nbsp;  Cheers  &nbsp;

      so much and so much and so much...  I am happy that I have started to take the time to learn more about why and how I react to things.  Accept a challenge now and then, learn from how I react to them too. And through all of it....remember I can do anything I set my mind to. I have felt like there were times in my life when I dragged myself with my finger nails to get through...but hey...whatta ya know?!?! I made it...and I will keep moving forward. I can feel the energy in the core of my being, maybe I should try to bask in it more often.   I have so many thoughts on so many different topics today. I can say this, BRING IT!   Cheers!

      I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago, thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though. Too bad it never found it's way to anyone who appreciated it though lol.  If Time was a River  If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd pack it with patience with laughter with care with passion and friendship and take some to spare If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd need someone steadfast to be on my crew And if I had get to choose, I plan to choose you   Ok that's not exactly the original but not bad if I do say so myself. I should dig up my old poems and get them on the blog...might be good for trip down my dark and twisted memory lane.  I was actually missing work today, but know I am not ready to go back just yet. A couple more weeks and I should feel better able to face the world head on again. It's been nice to just kind of see where the day takes me, but then I think about all those people I am not getting to help. I sometimes shake my head at the apathy so many of my co-workers have...then again so many people in the world are apathetic. When I get to hear "wow thank you soooo much why has no one ever taken that time to explain this to me?" or "You are a dear you took all my worries away" at least I know for the few minutes that person talked to me they felt like someone, somewhere cared about who they were and what they needed. Someone told me I had too much to give one time, isn't that what it's about though?? You give of yourself to the right people...and they give back to you...not rocket science yannow? Or give the right things to the right people. I almost wonder if it takes a stronger person to accept that you deserve to be given back to...instead of feeling like you constantly are going to "owe" something to someone.   Cheers!

      Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you. We all live with perceptions...about ourselves, others, the world..spend a lot of time classifying the same. In the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have. Nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage...it's not having what you want...it's wanting what you have.  I'm taking time for me for a change, and it is not an easy thing. I am so used to being many things to many people. But what I keep getting told is that if I don't take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted. Funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high...when I have thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. Ah if only...if only what I don't know...but...ahhh if only.  I love finding the beauty and art in everything...the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so. The brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool. The flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water. And her laughter...I still think it's one of the best things I have ever and will ever hear. Right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me I am loved. It's been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears...and here I sit reminding myself that she is the reason I need to be whole and happy.   Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile.  Cheers
