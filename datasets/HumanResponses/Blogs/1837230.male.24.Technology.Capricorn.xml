      I finally took the jump to Mozilla from IE and I must say, I am impressed. I first remember using Mozilla when I started playing with linux, oh about 6 years ago, and I can proudly say that IE may just be a thing of the past for me. Ofcourse there are a couple of glitches to be ironed out, but once you start loading the browesr up with extensions or plugins as we call them, you'll figure it out for yourself.  Go here to see what I mean :   urlLink Firefox Extensions   I recommend, the image zoom and nuke anything feature. Tabbed windows are also immensely cool, i can psuedo categorize my browsing experience. AWESOME!!

      when i first moved here, people told me that san francisco weather is awesome and therefore the raised home prices and the taxes and what not, and i used that to justify the fact that I could never buy a home anywhere respectably close to anywhere id want to be. But tell me... WHAT GOOD DOES 40 degree weather do for me in JULY.... I had some friends visiting, and the whole damn city was an ice belt in fucking JULY... thats not great weather... its SHITTY weather, and to make it even better, its hard to see three feet in front of the car when you're driving on the golden gate. Cant walk outside, cant stand outside, cant put my top down... fuck that, they should pay ME to live there...

      Now that orkut mania has completely taken over... and the realization has hit, that after uve added everyone u could possibly add, there is nothing more to really do, than to log on and make sure your face is appearing up in the recently logged on lists, i started browsing the communities, and surprisingly found a lot of interesting conversations taking place, in communities such as "Pakistan" and "Lahore" and "Pakistani Music".     As a result... ive bought a book on the recommendation of a complete stranger, and im going to be getting back to that now... I dream of microwaves...

      Ive been trying to figure out a way to get my media files into my living room without using rdp or vnc to control the damn thing, and ofcourse i stumbled upon the network media player market. While this is still a first generation market, there are some interesting products. The first of which caught my eye was the philips streamium range and the mxi-6000 in particular, which showed a lot of promise as a streaming device as well as home theatre system. It wasnt release yet, so my choices were limited to :  Prismiq Slim Devices Pinnacle Showcenter Icube NMP-4000 Gateway Connected DVD Hauppage Media MVP  Bought the Prismiq, because for allt he reviews i read, it was the way to go. Plays every imaginable format, and has a browser and chat built in as well as a wireless keyboard. Returned the prismiq, its too bleeding edge for me right now. Had issues connecting with the host computer, and the interface is horrible, though the slim devices hack for prismiq makes it a lot more desireable, this product has a LOT of potential.  Bought the Play@TV icube box, and thats what im sticking with. The interface is much cleaner, although I already have a laundry list of things that id like to see in it ( search by title is my biggest one) . Connection issues were a breeze, though i didnt test the wireless, since im using wired over powerline.       Here are some things id like to see in it :  1) Music Keeps Playing when screen changed 2) Queuing mechanism for music 3) Search by title  THere are some more that i cant think of right now. Overall its a great product.... so as i listen to my mp3 collection through my HT system in the other room, id advise you to look into this great market. Theres a lot of potential.
