      What a crap program! Only people who have watched it against their wills will  truly  realise this.   As soon as the starting music comes on 'Heartbeat (do do do do)',  I immediately try to switch off and ignore the crap that is on the TV  I know it could be because I didn't get my Sunday super sleep (heehee;)) but I actually feel asleep halfway through Heartbeat. Seriously.   I woke up, and I seriously didn't know what the hell was going on.   I know what you're all thinking, why didn't I just turn it over? But my mum came home from work early, and I haven't got power over what we're watching (sucks dunnit?), I wanted to watch Star Wars :(

      *Chrizz steps inside Confession Box*  Forgive me father, for I have sinned  I watch Big Brother  *Hangs head in shame*  But don't worry, I've got an excuse, 'there's nothing else on', which in fact is ultimately true, so it's not really an excuse:D  *Walks out of confession box*

      Of everyone in the world, my parents should know that I need to sleep, a lot. But no, they have to wake me up by putting up bloody coving downstairs! Right the story is that I get up to do a Sunday morning paper round (at roughly 6:30, a bit harsh, I know) and when I finish I get my ass straight back to bed. After watching TV of course :D  Now, this morning, it was raining, and I didn't take a jacket (I was thinking of going back to get one, but I couldn't be bothered and my round isn't anywhere near my house) which made me want to get back to bed more.   I got back, no problems, I watched TV, no problems, I went to sleep, no problems. Then about an hour and a half after falling asleep, I was RUDELY awakened with the sound of hammering below my room (I've got the only room upstairs), now, I tried to ask them to stop, but they just said 'it could be an all-day thing'  It wasn't, they've finished...  I..was...pissed. I knew I couldn't go back to sleep, so I had to go downstairs, away from the hammering. Then there was nowt on telly (see a previous post), in the end, I resorted to watching WWE (I was very very bored)  Now I'm knackered, but I wanna stay up late(ish) tonite to watch Swordfish, on Channel 4 for any Brits reading this:)

      I know I don't pay taxes, but on Sim City, people have to pay them, and if I raise them by even the slightest bit, people start bitching about them! Right, picture the situation, I make a massive city, with taxes that aren't too high, but I'm still not getting enough money. Right, I've made things that have high monthly maintenance costs, that I'm convinced can't not have a place in my city (things such as the Empire State Building, the John Hancock Centre, and the White House, there's also bridges, shops and roads and stuff, but they aren't that important :p), and I can't get enough money in to break even.   Such as, at one point, I was losing 30,000 a month (thank fuck for cheats!!) but I was making a bit back, I don't know how, but I was.   I think it all stems from not having enough money in real life (I wish there were cheats!) I don't know.

      Hello everyone, in true Chrizzkit stylee, I'm following the herd and making a blogspot of my own, and is just going to be another basic place for me to vent every so often. I know I probably shouldn't be sharing my feelings with everyone on the wide internet.    I shall off this brand new shiny Blog by saying   FUCKING GCSE's!!   I really can't be doing with much more of this crap. I know, I've done two so far, and am probably just over-reacting, but I really don't like tests. I'm not a person who can sit down for hours on end, revising. I have to be doing something, and that something usually involves playing some form of game (Sim City is a new favourite :D) but then I get too wound up in the game, and forget all about revising, so it's safer just not to start revising in the first place  Probably a bit long, but my feelings are gunna be like that, people don't talk to me, and generally I keep my feelings inside (I dunno why, that's just me)  Till the next time I remember about this

      Yeah, I know I should be really really happy that I've left school, and I only need to go back for exams, and all that, but the programs that are on, really do suck!   But then again, I look at it this way, next week, all the kids are gunna be on school holiday, so there'll be some 'better' programs on  I hope...

      Howdy ho. As most of the civilised world knows by now, England were knocked out of Euro 2004 last night. All the Portuguese people will say it's because of their superior players, BULLSHIT IT WAS!!   IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT BENT REFEREE!!  What the fuck was wrong with John Terry?! He was watching the ball, he went up for the ball, and it just so happened that he HAPPENED to TOUCH the shoulder of the Portuguese keeper, therefore cancelling the WINNING GOAL AND MAKING IT THEN GO TO BASTARD PENALTIES  I'm sure everyone also knows that England always lose penalties, and that BASTARD referee just wanted to see us go out.   The linesman gave the goal!! I have no (real) problem with linesman, just bent referees! Generally the ref takes the opinion of the linesman, BUT NOOOOOOOO, he had to just fucking ignore the linesman, and give it in their bastard favour!!!  Grrrr, bastard...

      Hi-de-hi everyone, I know it's been a while(ish) since my last rant, but the truth is, I needed 'more fuel for the fire'. Just a couple of points today, that I'll probably go on about for ages after.   Blisters suck ass! They really really do! Not only am I crap at sparring, but whenever I've got a bit of momentum going, do I then get pains in my feet! You'd think after a while, my feet would get used to bouncing slightly, but no, every time I really go flat out, my frigging little toes (on both fucking feet!) get totally kaned. It could be the way I spar, because I try to stay on my toes all the time, but in my opinion, that's the best way to fight (just in case you've gotta get out of the way quick), or it could just be me having soft feet. Anyway, they fooking hurt! Especially when you have to peel them off, firstly it looks sick, and second, it fooking hurts!   Punctures, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. THERE'S NO NEED! Today, I was feeling pretty rraabbish to be quite honest. I mean, I had bad ass blisters on my feet, threatening my walking (seriously!), and punctures, so I had to walk everywhere. Well to tell the truth, I couldn't be arsed to walk for a little bit, so I just pumped up my tyre and tried to get home before it went down. Hey, it worked! Then the bad news was I actually had to fix the bugger! Nah, as I said, I couldn't be arsed, so mum just got me a new inner tube and tyre instead. Besides, it was really thin anyway, just a matter of time before it fucking blew up. Then came the bugger of getting the new tyre and inner tube in, which involved taking the entire wheel off. Ah well, to me it was worth it, that tyre was really thin as I said. Plus, now I know that I haven't missed any punctures. I did this morning. grrrrr. Dad woke me up at 7:00 (see earlier posts about sleep) to fix punctures, and it could have been because I was half asleep, but I somehow missed some more holes in my tyre. Which meant, as soon as I started biking, the tyre went down, which also meant I had to walk halfway to school. With blisters. Ouch.   Why is time goes slowest when you can't be arsed to do something? Take this situation right, sitting in an exam, finished the paper, about half an hour to go, no phone to mess about with, no books to read, no computer to play on. Basically I'm living about 100 years in the past. Bored outta my fucking mind. To me anyway, the only option is to draw on my hand, which usually involves a great big pattern that can sometimes 'grow' up my arm. There's also another option, which is basically staring into space, but then I look stoned, and when we get out, someone will probably say something to me. Humming or singing to myself can't work, mostly beause I'll probably shout out, and as we all know in exams, you've gotta shut the fuck up, especially in GCSE's  Meh, not as long and anger filled as the last one, meh, not much to complain about, I've nearly finished with all my rants.

      Woke up late today, ESPECIALLY cranky, not happy at all.   First on the chopping block, goes news. What the fuck is the point of putting it right the middle of a fucking film?! Some people could suffer from memory loss and forget what the fuck is going on (in the film), or it could be getting to a good part. Another thing, fucking ITV, what the fuck is the point?! Now, last night, Hannibal was on, and since I have seen Silence of the Lambs (which was on last week), I figured I deserved to watch Hannibal, so I did, the only thing was it finished at 1:15 in the fucking morning, and as fucking always, I had to be up early for paper round. So I decided to watch it all (I believe in watching all or none of a program, if you can't watch the end, don't bother watching the start, you'll just wonder what the fuck happened, same deal with Hannibal last night) and therefore stayed up till 1:15, then I couldn't sleep, so I went on the comp for a little bit, tried to sleep for a bit, didn't work, read for a little bit (this was like 2am), then I finally got to sleep at like 2:30, and I had to be up at 6:30 (well, I didn't have to, I wanted to get up early, so I could finish the round early, and get home to watch TV and sleep). But no, I woke up at 7:30, persuaded Dad to take me round in the car (because I wanted to get back quickly to watch TV and stuff), plus it was raining, and I couldn't be arsed to go around for an hour and a half in the pouring raining, going to and from the fucking paper shop (which takes fucking ages), at least when we go in the car, we can take all the papers out in one go (which is fucking impossible to do on bike, I've got like 50 thick papers) and therefore eliminates the going to and from the shop.   Next we move to Pop Beach from Channel 4. I know a lot of the people who are reading this like the music that will be on offer there, but the adverts are doing my fucking head in!! To be quite honest, they were annoying when they first came on, (ABOUT 20 FUCKING YEARS AGO!!) with June Sarpingpong and her annoying scratchy voice talking about who will be on Great Yarmouth beach (wow, fun in the sun!) on June 6th. Yes, I did pretty much memorise it, IT'S ON EVERY FUCKING AD BREAK!!  Just to reiterate on a previous post, LET ME FUCKING SLEEP!! Especially when I've had a late night, just leave the fucking house, and let me sleep in peace. Come on! I mean, I try to stay quiet when you're trying to sleep, could you at least let me do that?!  My room is fucking weird, I mean, it's like the warmest room in the summer, AND the coldest in the winter. It is not nice, for example, in the winter, I'm there with like two fucking jumpers on, and the fucking fan heater at full blast.  Finally in my little rant, we have a point that is related to a previous point in this post, and that is that all the decent programs are on really late at night, and usually on days when I can't watch them. Such as on school nights, and Saturday nights (when I've gotta be up early for papers in the morning).   I know I said fuck a lot in this post, I don't really give a shit.   It could be because I've lost out on sleep that I'm this cranky, but I just need to vent every so often.

      I really don't like these paper companies who think they are better than all the 'paper delivery specialists' (a fancy way of saying paper boys :p)  I mean, the big newspaper companies (like the Daily Mail, the News of the World and so forth) don't really give two shits about who will be delivering the papers, they can just chuck any old shit in their papers. Like on Sundays, I have to deliver like 50 papers, and each one has more fucking adverts than the TV!   Plus there's all the CD's they keep chucking in there. You can't get the fucking papers through the fucking doors! Then there's people with extra small letterboxes, they just piss me off, I usually fold the papers in half (as if closing a book) and if there's bloody CDs hidden in there, it just ain't possible!   So eventually I just take the paper apart (take the pages out) until it all fits through the letter box (which can take a fooking long time, I tell thee!)   I'll probably be back tomorrow when I've got more to complain about. Grrrr...

      ...to the perfect Pot Noodle!  Well, it's perfect in my eyes anyway. There's a load of water, and still lots of noodles.   I think I can reveal to everyone who is reading this (which can't be many, I know), when filling the Pot for the first time, do NOT fill until the line they say you should, that's just crap, and doesn't leave any water for the crappy bits at the bottom.   DO NOT CONFORM TO THE LINE! FIGHT THE POWER!  *Chrizz realizes he's sounding like Kitten from Big Brother, holds head in hands*  *Chrizz realizes he knows too much, runs from room screaming*

      Yo all.  Last April I started playing Kings of Chaos, which is, for those of y'all who don't know, an online Roleplaying game, where you start an army and attack other people. it's got Lord of the Rings races, like Orcs and Elves and stuff.   If you wouldn't mind, could you click this link and then press the number it tells you to  urlLink http://www.kingsofchaos.com/recruit.php?uniqid=v284k8b8   This is basically to get people into my army so I can kick more ass. You don't really have to, but it would make me very happy (:D)   Recently a new Age has been started, and all of the accounts have been reset, so I've pretty much lost all of my ass-kicking abilites. I'm slowly but surely clawing back though, I've even persuaded someone else to join.   Yey, go me

      Yeah, I know I haven't posted in quite a while, but the truth is, I'm a lazy git, and I don't really know what else I could complain about.  Welp, I'M BAAAAACK  It actually turns out I was wrong, people didn't cry, dancing was kept down to a minimum (honest ;))&nbsp; and to my complete shock, there wasn't any snogging&nbsp;(that I could see anyway). The only real shitty thing about that night was that we didn't get a picture taken. Right, the deal was that when people got to the Oaklands, they would get out of their cars (or limos in many cases, grr)&nbsp; and have their photos taken, possibly for the local paper (big whoop!), and because we got there so early, the paper people hadn't even turned up yet. Ah well, knowing my luck, we wouldn't have even got in anyway.  I've started playing the Lottery, I feel like I'm being screwed. I've played twice, and I could have had 4 numbers on both. For example, I would pick 1, 11, 15 and 31, and the proper numbers would be 2, 12, 16 and 32. No fair, I should get paid for that right?  Started shaving too, rubbish.   Nothing to report since then, just repeating previous posts, such as blisters, why they suck ass, and why people should let me sleep.   SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALLYFUCKINGDOCIOUS, haha, I spelt it :p Yeah, my darling brothers have played that song for like 4 days solid, and it's doing my head in.   Anyway, till next time...

      Hi-de-hi everyone  Right, I know I'm a teenager, and should therefore be into 'texting' and all that.  Bollocks  Not only do people not talk to each other any more, but text messaging language has fucking taken over!  I mean, people are becoming lazier and lazier with their writing style. For example, I might text someone (which sounds sick in itself), just because I can't be arsed to talk, in perfect English, vowels included, and then be replied with 'K cul8r' WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?! (I know what it means, but to someone who has never been outside might not have a fucking clue)   If you can't be arsed to use the Queen's English, don't bother speaking. I know from time I might mess things up, but I at least I'm trying, there are some people who just always whenever they're on the computer or have conversations over text messages ALWAYS  Lzy bstrds...  Anyway, off to the Prom tonite, so I might be back tomorrow with more rantings, which could include anything from crying (other people around me crying, I'm too macho) to frigging dancing.   Oh the joy...
