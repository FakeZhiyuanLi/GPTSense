      whoa~ been a long tym since i last blog over here~ too tired out i guez~ hmm..lets try n get started k? hmm...firz up wud be the 7-a-side soccer competition at sp~ somehow dat dae has got to be the luckiest dae in the world~ we were up agst a team who trained for days together while we juz met up n started the match~ the start of the match started out equally wif both sides taking shots at goal~ Due to poor finishing and tight defences,no goals were seen at the first half. the 2nd half is when u get to c the goals n the action~ Defensive error led to the firz goal~ after a nice 1-2,the opposition got past the defence n a defender who was supposed to be at the right post when awol which resulted in the goal~ with 1 goal down,we began to mount our fight back~ dzaki was beginning to deliver those dangerous crosses while ansar was terrorising players wif his fakes,sambas n all the trickery he cud muster~ nabil was marshalling the defence while anwar was overlapping at right back~ hamdani was outstanding between the post preventing any shots in~ Completely agst the run of play,dzaki swiftly took the ball away from the opposition n dribbled towards the penalty box~ spotting ashafie's run,he delivered a lofty cross which was controlled well by ash as he slammed the ball to the back of the net!!! The fans cheered wif great applause~ surprisingly,ashafie was called wiliam hung~ haha~ guez he's small n fair~ haha~ aniwae, the penalty shootout was nerve-racking~ hamdani,dzaki and ashafie failed to convert the penalty kicks but eventually we prevailed we've goals from anwar,ansar n the winning goal from nabil as the opposition eventually buckled~ woohoo~ we r in the qualifiers~!!!  i hope the text juz now wasnt too long...well,nxt i guez wud be my firz training wif pasirian~ it has to be the moz nervous dae i ever had~ on the wae there,i met up wif my fren who told me abt those wonderful stuff those pasirians cud do~ i was so nervous i didnt even wanna step into the hall~ luckily, i cud muster up enuf courage to enter the hall n watch their warm up~ their passing was superb~ shooting brilliant~ it was fantastic~ it was such a joy to watch~ i'm nuting compared to them~ it also came to my realisation tat we from sp are nuting sia~ we reallie nid a coach to address tiz problem fast~ aniwae,on my firz trg match,3 on 3,very embarassing sia~ headed on to a high pass which resulted into a penalty~ kena lobang abt 3 tymz~ very de malu sehz~ my passing was damn fast oso,mcm shooting sak~ very different from the rough ground at skewl~ sum more i so kan chiong n nervous~ wah lao~ feel lyk restarting sia! haha~ aniwae,i'll be back for more man! i'm gonna learn from these batch of floorball players n improve myself more~ Tiz iz my goal!

      Shooting drills.  1-touch shooting. sum1 provides the rolling ball for the striker to shoot to goal~  semi-circle shooting. starts with 2 players on both flanks moving in a semi-circle like manner towards the centre of the goalpost. one of them has the ball and fakes a shot while the other takes the shot~  duno wad else to put lehz~ todae got elective~ haf to teach them abt the central role~ as in wad to do,wad u can do ahz~ basic stuff~ hopefully,got promising lads~ hmmz...wad else ehz? later2 lahz~ damn sleepy~ sleep 8 hrz but eyes like koala bear. lolz~ adioz~

      lotz of info going thru my head~ nid to jot it down sumwhere to remember~  Defending drills~  2-on-1 2 attackers play 1-2 to get past tat single defender to score the goal~  2-on-2 2 attackers agst 2 defenders~ * extremely impt for defenders to learn tiz as it helps eliminate 1-2s~ zonal n diagonal styles~ depend on defenders style of play~  Ball Control Drill  evri1 has a ball in the court. GOAL: eliminate evri1's ball while keeping ur own~  Teamwork Drill  play 3 on 3~ goals not impt~ itz how the 3 players communicate wif each other to obtain the goal~ individual skills are secondary~  Passing drills  simple pass 2 players play passing wif each other.  lob pass passing a simple chip to player wif a defender in the middle.  triangle passing keeping possession~  I guez datz all for now~ will be able to update more soon~

      1 mth break from blogging~ zzz~ damn bz ahz~ here's how the one month went by~ 2 frenliez,tiga penjuru,tonz of tez and reportz juz passed~ 2 disappointing frenliez,one agst a relatively weak ite dover winning 2-0 wif very poor finishing. the other agst ite tamp losing 3-0~ haiz~ damn poor finishing especially one glaring miss by me~ after gd build-up storming into the danger area,all i needed was to tap the ball into the top corner but ended up i cudnt turn my stick further and a glaring miss was evident. haiz~ another one of my long range shot was also saved by ite tamp keeper. cud feel myself improving as an individual but overall the whole team loz physically and mentally. lack of experience was also clear for all to see~ Haiz~ if only a coach lyk filip dahlgren or stefan dahlgren wud help us~ Tiga penjuru was also relatively disappointing~ played 3 matches in the group stage and ended up 2nd in the group and failed to qualify for the quarter-finalz. the firz game was almoz a nightmare as we scraped a hard-fought draw as the players seemed unmotivated and seemed to play wif no desire to win. Naturally,the blistering heat was to blame as ourz was the firz game.  the 2nd game was better as we slowly shifted into high gear as we controlled the match from start to finish~ if i was not wrong,we won 3-1~ the third match however was a disaster~ it seemed lyk the spsu comp agst Line 7. We were thrashed wif absolutely no answerz for our dismal display. It was we were fighting a foregone conclusion when in reality all we needed was a draw to get through the group stages winning marginnally by goal difference. haiz~ Tez are next. blardy hell of paperz~ got thru the rez wif relative ease but did badly for MIP~ argh!!!! when m i gonna settle in well wif physics? calculationz are not much of a prob but tonz of mumbo-jumbo thrash shit about materials which seems rather unrelevant dun make much sense to me~ Reports even more worse~ cant remember much of wad i do coz seemed to do them without using much brain power~ lolz~ the only one would be MIP which i wrote wif farok about floorball blades~ abt itz use,itz material and FLOORBALL! lolz~ guez i'm juz a floorball freak~  Manz,gonna miz airhooking for two weekz~ gonna "puasa" airhook to concentrate on studiez a little~ LUCK plz~ May the examz be in the palm of my hand~ lolz~ dun wad i saying oso~  The rising sun bringz freshness to the day, The glowing moon sees all but me, You brought me hope, my inspiration all day, No more alone but she and me...

      Public Apology To SP Floorball Management.  Firstly, I would like to apologise to Handy for my straightforwardness and probably for giving u such a hard time. I really am giving constructive criticism but it might be too much for u too handle. Had a talk and discussion wif Jie Hong n Kin Leong abt me going too far and me being in deep trouble. I dun really mind as long as i made my mark however most of my remarkz were really misunderstood. I neva wanted to bring the club up myself but together with u all bring the club up. together. I juz wanna be a helper. to noe and understand what is going on. not being thrown ard juz to play. Tatz how we feel as players. I'm reallie sorie to put u in such a bad mood but it was neva meant to blast ani1. Not even a single person. Anger reveals the evil in evri1 and i was stupid to succumb to it. Sorie man. I'll shake hands wif ya somedae on saturdae on the nxt trg ya? As to the rez of the management,i'm sorie guyz n galz alike. I'm speaking on behalf of the rez of the guy playerz. Oh yeah, Jie Hong told me about the exhibition match and stuffz. I neva meant to ask the hall of the booth. I was asking for the hall in fc3~ Aniwae,thankz for evriting the whole management haf done for the club. I'm reallie sorie to all..  Yours Sincerely, Mohd Akil   If there's aniting u all wanna tok abt feel free to approach me on msn. I should be there moz of the tym. Thankz.

      Public Apology To Sp Floorball Management.  Ok~ I'll start off with a sorry to all u guyz and galz from the Sp Floorball Management. Had a discussion with Jie Hong and Kin Leong juz now after training with Line 1. It went pretty fine considering the fact that again I have really bad presentation skills and people alwaez misintepret me. Proof can easily be taken from my results and my frenz. I neva wanted to bring up the club myself. Neva. If you still dun believe, you can clarify with the whole of Line 1 and Jie Hong and Kin Leong. All i want is us together to bring the club to greater heights. Not me alone. I did state i juz wanna help. haiz. I'm sorie that i'm quite sharp-tongued or wadeva u call it but i'm straightforward and i do wad is right. Hopefully from now onwards,we can train together as a team as one playing together with the unity that could bring us victory. and Handy,i'm prepared to shake ur hand and sae sorie for wad i haf done. Hope u'll accept it. Thankz. And another round of apology to the rez of the management. I'm sincere and from the bottom of my heart i'm sorie.  Sincerely yours, Mohd Akil

      Wowz~ Even blogger has a new outlook~ nice one blogger~ Keep it up~ Aniwae,juz blogging about training~ Firzly,it turned out pretty well considering the fact that we trained first touch pretty well especially during monkey or wad we call "pig-in-the-middle" However,some of the training methods have to be revised.   First,Shooting. It is too complicated and the shooter and dribbler tend to get confused. It also doesnt allow the shooter much freedom to select what kind of shots~ so the bez would be a simple pass from the right to the shooter running to the middle. then the shooter shoots aniwae he likez while the passer runs to collect his shot behind the goalie. the shooter then takeover the role of passer and it goes on and on~ This is pretty fast paced so it helps to increase pace as well as stamina~  Second,4 on 4 matches is scrapped~ too many people prevents creativity on a small pitch~ It shall now be 3 on 3~ no more no less~ subs shall be on the substitution zonez to practise b4 the league.  Third, dribbling should be done from a simple level to a hard level. putting cones and asking ppl juz to dribble ard is very hard. ppl can't juz dribble round 9 ppl(cones) in one trg ryt? I'll probably think tiz out sooner or later depending on the level.  Other than those stated above,everiting was great~ Chill out guyz~ there's abt 8 trgz to go~ Adioz Amigoz~

      hmmz...well,we got the name stuck up kidz~ lolz~ can't believe evri1 new cud sae we r the bad onez while handy is so gd~ i neva ever said handy was bad neither do i tink so~ He's been great in fact to do all those stuffz for us~ But we had to persuade him b4 he does tat~ the boards we asked for it almoz evrytym we c him,n he alwaez sae soon not even knowing when is it aksheli coming~ he entered SP into IVP~ thankz~ but i guez itz automatic since he's got lotsa contactz n johnson cud put the whole team there~ hmm...I didnt blame Handy only~ N i believe what we did was constructive criticism in a sarcastic way~ If no1 was at fault,i accept it~ Coz i believe evri1 is at fault and i'm taking the step to criticise people to make them improve~ Thankz for criticising us coz it cud only make us better~ Our IQ aint higher than Einstein and neither is any1 else~ so evri1 has the ryt to say wadeva they want. Think when the mind is on the right way up~ hmm...was it sudden? dun tink so~ u haf to go thru the whole thing which we went thru b4 u noe~ Life seems ez from the viewpoint above but not when u r an earthworm being trampled upon~ wad else ehz? We r doing nuting? let me c~ B4 ivp,trg was a bare minimal of Line 1~ 5 playerz playing wif stickz and a ball on a big red court~ Thankz for booking it for us~ If we didnt train,IVP wud be a goner. We took the initiative while u guyz went for ITP n left us alone~ I understand itz part of ur studies but we did sumting. Now b4 league, we did our own trg schedule to train ourselves b4 the league. We neva asked for ur help abt it~ We haf enuf abt the management and we r doing sumting abt it~ Itz juz u guyz do not c it~ We wanted frenliez n i organised a few b4 but handy alwaez refused saying he wantz to tok to them and duno wad stuff n i let him~ but all was declined~ I let it be n let those wif better frenlies take over~ they did n we obliged~ We did sumting ryt? wad did we do wrong? wad is it tat u c in us tat is wrong? we r playful n mischievous n wadeva but wad we haf in us is the desire to achieve greater heights for spfloorball~ all of us including all of u guyz~ Sorie if we like gila2 n criticise u guyz but we haf been patient for 1 yr and we are still stagnant~ take TE Knightz for example~ they are alwaez at the bottom of the league for 5 YEARZ! But wad makez them different from us is they improve at the end of every league~ Now is 1 yr,but wad haf we improved in? we dun want a repeat of tiz yr thus we wish to improve nxt yr~ We wanted a coach n all we nided was an email to SFA n they'll do their best to help us~ cash cud be collected from us abt $2-4 per person~ Maybe paper arrangements are tough and johnson does not allow but we cud try~ haiz~ I dun understand y can't ppl see the desperation in our eyes? We understand about u guyz and we try our best neva to disturb u guyz~ But u guyz also haf to understand us~ U are fucked up abt ur own life,we haf fucked up lives too~ I haf a gal i loved a lot but i let her go coz she wanted to~ Call me stupid but there a specific rizenz which led to tat~ I still love her n yearn for the day we cud be together~ Examz~ We haf examz too~ Evri exam is difficult n evri1 has to be studied~ So we r equally stressed~ evri1 is~ so wad is the fucking problem? haiz~ I'm damn tired now~ Juz dun understand a thing now~ U all wanna do aniting u wan juz do it~ We wont ask for aniting more~ call us bratz or wadeva~ We'll lead our own u'll lead urz~ Adioz Amigoz~

      hmm...wad can i sae todae huh? feels pretty bored updating tiz blog~ but guez there's nuting much i cud do~ damn tiring dae~ more bcoz of yesterdae~ The ETC (EXTRA TASTY AND CRISPY) chicked seemed to attract damn a lot of crowdz~ juz yesterdae the crowd neva left from 6+ till 10 sia~ All the chickenz were gone by 10.30 and zingerz were sold like hotcakes~ some even settled for small pieces of chicken like wingz and drumz~ lolz~ wad a dae~ Todae, i'll be at it again at the cashier selling those chickenz~ todae,the crowd will definitely be more so i hope i won't get a splitting headache remembering customer's orders~ And hopefully,those working at base dun jam any stuffz~   hmmz...but now i got problem...go to spfb chalet n tok cock wif my team matez or eat supper wif my kfc colleagues~ naturally,i'll rather go spend supper or juz get home and sleep~ but my teammatez are urging me to go to the chalet and seems that many people over there are great fun with those hockey playerz~ but the atmosphere ain't the right type so maybe i'll give it a miss~ hmmz,i dun care lahz~ i'll take wadeva comez firz~ main priority is to go home and rez!!!  Wad the heck,evritingz juz a game, u move left and right and save the dame, ain't there nuting else than fame and shame, coz i'd rather sleep or write something lame...

      juz some thought to note down b4 i go study fer my laz paper for awhile n maybe manage stuttgart~ firzly,would be line 1 formation~ obviously since line 2 is handled by themselves~ firzly, i shud be returned to central role for the obvious rizen dat i can't be trusted to defend on the right when the more defensive minded rizal is available~ this bringz about more stability to the tetris like defence~ i'll operate as per normal as a centreman initiating attackz as well as defence~ I'll rotate wif fiz weneva possible as strikerz or centremen~ tiz serves as confusion as well as reducing our own confusion to a minimal~ tiz also helps reduce both our burdens~ If,there's anymore i'll update soon~ another matter would be training which seems very hard wif no keyz to the equipment due to it being "on hold" ~ hmm...y? examz is it? da nak abiz lahz johnson~ zzz~ so probably individual on the ball skills will be trained and farhan's shot-stopping will be trained using 2 dustbins as goalposts~ stamina and fitness got to be done 3 timez a week i guez~ jogging and stuffz~ manz~ tiz is gonna be shiok~ 3 timez a wk trg,3 timez a wk work~ woohoo~ Come on div 2~ Give us ur best shot~

      Some quote i've read in the sp webby,  "The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.."  This was quoted by albert Einstein which tells us how imbalanced this world is~ There are juz too many evil people in this world and those who do aniting abt it may juz get outnumbered and lose out~ And itz not tat ez to do "aniting abt it"... haiz~ juz guez life's hard~   Life starts lyk an electron orbitting itz nucleus, spinning continuously lyk a magnetic dipole, Each and evri1 of us is as insignificant as mucus, yet many still stand out as tho they got big assholes!

I wish for the end of everything, the start of a new beginning, Every game i play in starts with nothing, ending with me alone, pinning...  Life was neva the way i wanted it to be, neva cud i haf the chance of letting it be, if ever there was a wish i cud have, all i want would be death...

       SP Floorball Board       It has come to my notice that some of the spfloorball players are becoming very high profile mingling with celebrities and people from the opposite sex. Some have been caught and published in the Weekly Bugle or the Old paper and pretty soon some may appear on video on News 7 Today. Therefore, warning letters have been sent out to the players concerned to keep their profiles in check or I would enforce a curfew to the whole squad. With the upcoming IVP in September, all players must be in tip top condition and be playing in the right frame of mind. I would like to wish all players a great competition in the upcoming IVP and hope that we will achieve a higher standing this year. Special mention goes to hafiz for being the top scorer in the division 2 league and I wish him all the best in getting those goals in for SP. As for the rest,keep up the good work and good luck!

      Cheryl Fox was present during the frenly of SP agst YJC!    Reporter: What do you think of the SP squad agst YJC?    Cheryl Fox: The SP 2nd-stringers did well to hold back the YJC onslaught and hit them on the break. Great work guyz!    Reporter: What are your comments on the SP keeper? Ur eyes seemed to be ogling on him throughout the match.    Cheryl Fox: U noticed that too? The  SP goalie was wearing 2 G-strings outside his pants. weird huh? And the protection he was wearing looked like a tank top.  That was a really refreshing experience.     Reporter: That must have turned u on yeah? haha...    Cheryl Fox: Well, SP's no.18 is pretty sexy too. He's name is akil ryt? he's butt has got to be one of the sexiest. I'm probably got the nominate him for it on the next issue of FHM.    Reporter: Woohoo! That's pretty hot news...    The guyz from SP seem to have created a buzzing frenzy among themselves. Players from A-Z have created a media frenzy and may create some problemz to the team manager. let's hope Evangelista doesnt find out...

      Rumours are hot! SP players caught "warming up" with gals!    First of the lot is fizzy a.k.a Hafiz. This hot-shot was caught closing up to emma watson at KFC bugis over a tray of Singapura Satay Burger. (Budget kaper?)    2nd is Adzmin otherwise known as A-che-min. This manjakid may be no playboy but he seems pretty busy with his handphone nowadays. He was caught red-handed in front of the freshies as he had to answer a call in the middle of a training match. ( tak leh tunggu kaper? )  Excerpts from the call:    ****: ermm,bz ke cayang?    Adzmin: Alah,tgh game nie. Nanti mlm kita bebual agi k? ******!    (Some of the words are censored to protect the identity of the gal as well as the intensity of the conversation.)    3rd is Rizal otherwise known as Gay-Bob. This guy with the seemingly fierce and smart outlook could fool anyone dat he's some businessman. However, this guy seems to have some hidden identity. Caught french kissing with a freshie,Shamil, and sometyms to Adzmin. Not once though. (desperate kaper? )    4th is Farok known as Rokok-boi. This playboy seems to have nuting else to do other than snuggling up to gals or going up to any pretty gal and ask for number. Known for changing galz lyk using toilet paper. Last seen at hotel 81 with a gal at Geylang...(ish3,buat maksiat kaper?)    5th is Akil a.k.a kewl kid. This guy under his kewl and quiet demeanour is one dangerous maniac. Caught harassing "7 stars" online as well as disturbing SP fans. (lu gila kaper?)    6th is Farhan. Quiet and relatively unknown. Caught at R.O.M with a lady nicknamed Trotters. If there is any info abt her and farhan,plz inform me at the tagboard. (Lu tak sabar moh kahwin siang2 kaper? ) Thank you.    Last but not least is Afsal. This big bad beetleborg opz, i mean big friendly giant isnt ur normal average defender. He does his job well on court but off-court he's pretty high on "tanni". Was charged in court many times for drink-driving. Recently, seen going "home" early from trainings with a social escort.  The gal is pretty hot though...;)    hmmm...Are these floorballers damn hot or wad? Can't wait to get your hands on them? Get to know them well when u come down to our trainings on weekends on sat 9-12pm or on sundays 2-6pm. While stocks last.     More updates will be available soon....

      Early News Update....    The 2nd period and third period was a seriously tensed affair between YJC and SP. Both were going in hard with tackles trying to get the upper hand in midfield as well as creating goals. Many goal oppurtunities were spurned well by the midfielders yet moz of them were squandered by the bungling strikers from both sides. YJC was always the one who took the early one goal lead but could not hld on to it fer long. SP's determination and spirit showed and they came roaring back each time YJC scored.  At the score of 4-3 with YJC leading, SP was desperate as the lines were reshuffled with two holding midfielders introduced to stem YJC's flow of play. The tactic worked miraculously as 2 goals were scored in quick succession. First,was a backhand shot from Gary who received a nice flank pass from the right. It caught the keeper off-guard and went into the bottom corner. FORZA SP was heard evriwhere as the stands cheered. Next,was Rizal, a solid central defender playing as a holding player,who scored a simple tap in from a slide-rule pass from a seemingly tireless Adzmin. Once again,cheers were heard. Everyone was ecstatic as SP was surprisingly in the lead! Amazingly,YJC counter-attacked well and got the lead again through another seemingly harmless defence error. YJC was a brave and courageous team. Overall,both teams did very well. Three cheers for SP n YJC! HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!!    Warning! The reporter for today is high on "tanni". Due to the win,he may have been celebrating at Sultan road over briyani with Carlsberg. Thousand apologies to all concerned.  Exaggeration is purely coincidental and for  amusement. Thank you.

       Latest News Update For The SP Floorball Team on NEWS 5 TONIGHT.   The SP team were up against the much vaunted YJC team on Sunday at their homeground. It was a much heavily contested match with both sides attempting to settle their revenge. The day before the sp gals were beaten 6-3 by the YJC team. It gives us the much needed fuel to drive us to victory over this match. The YJC also do have a score to settle. They were beaten soundly by us the previous meeting 7-3. This was the time for them to payback.    The match started out fiercely with both sides attempting to gain possession through the centre to gain more attempts on goal. YJC managed to get their first few attempts on goal via long shots from their midfielders as SP defence started to leak. However SP got the lead pretty surprisingly through Farok as the YJC defence gifted a ball to Adzmin who slipped the ball to farok who juz needed an exquisite finish to give SP the lead. SP then scored another goal a few minutes later through a brilliant run by Fala through the middle catching YJC unaware. The ever nimble Hafiz slipped behind the whole defence to score the goal via a mis-save by the YJC keeper.&nbsp;&nbsp;YJC then scored through a seemingly harmless error by SP as the defence pulled wide giving the YJC midfield a chance to score through a long shot with the keeper screened by a YJC striker.     The 2nd period will began after this messages....

      Ever been to an MLM Company? YOu will find that they function like a cult, always ready to brainwash the next one that appear at the doorway. They will tell you that if you are ready to work hard, you will be successful and rich. They will tell you that if you are not even willing to listen, you are a loser. They will make you believe that if you fail here, you cannot succeed anywhere else in the world.   Right... Kind of naive, don't you think?   First things first, Singapore is such a small market, too small for so many MLM Companies to coexist. (Go do your maths..) 2nd, Products thay are selling are already on the shelves of established companies. (Go watch some advertisements) 3rd, Not everyone possess the 'Salesman's gift of gap'. 4th, When you are doing MLM, you are not a boss or entrepreneur, you are just a salesman thinking that you are a boss...   Guys.. come on, surely you can figure this out right...   juz some text i cut n paste from a forum~ MLM~ multi-level marketing~ wadya tink of it? lolz~ as tiz person had said it~ It SARKZ!

       MILO! Our official sponsor for the IVP 2004! SP have signed a new sponsor worth a lucrative deal of 999 million RUPEES!   SP Floorball have approached Milo to be a sponsor for their ongoing expansion of the club name to all people in Singapore. With Milo, many people would think about SP Floorball the moment the drink touches their lips. Milo has been Singapore's trusted food drink for sportsmen and sportswomen alike. With this deal, SP Floorball could be seen as a household name in the years to come.  BAd news for Milo fans though. Due to SP floorball's current jersey deal with VONDA and UMBRO other sponsors are not allowed on their jerseys. This is to give the jersey a clean and clearer image and not look like some kind of uniform. But dont be disappointed, for SP's friendly against ITE CLEMENTI all fans are treated to free flow of hot or cold milo in the stands. ENJOY!

       News Update....Rizal dispute over insurance matters...ONgoing debate on CNA on the choosing of the SP IVP Squad....   Rizal, the gay defender in SP IVP has engaged a lawyer to settle a dispute over his sprained neck and sore right eye. It seems he was unfairly elbowed in the face and was pushed against the boards with unfair justice given out by the referee. He was reported to be pissed by the incident and almost caused a brawl which resulted in Shamil breaking his stick. -=]biar btul sak?[=- His gay partner, Adzmin , reportedly said that "I will fight for Rizal's right and make sure he gets his insurance. He was unfairly elbowed!" The case is reportedly to be of little importance to the SP Board as the amount of insurance Rizal could get is pittance compared to the amount they have. What is most important is the extent of his injury. He is out for 6-7 days and may need to have last minute checkups before the ITE WEST CLEMENTI clash on Sunday.  CNA has launched a new debate over the SP IVP Squad. It concerns matters of SP Floorball and is reported to bring in a record number of viewers for its first screening on Sunday at 2pm. The debate which started a week ago discusses about the lines present in the SP Squad. The IVP Squad of the first 15 have been finalised yet some are still unsure of their strategy.  The veteran members of the squad,notably Jie Hong and Ahmad are strong defensive kingpins which strike fear to defenders not only because of their size but their tactical defensive know-how. -=]I'm not reallie sure what i'm talking abt tho...:)[=- However,the over-reliance on these players may result in total defensive play thus making the line boring and unproductive in obtaining the goals.  The youth players however are very promising. Shamil -=]which juz broke his stick :P[=- has proved to be a gd defender together with Zaki marshalling defence and breaking up attacks. However,their strike-force are barely tested with Shaiful taking few shots at goal. Their pace and youth may inject fresh ideas into the squad but their talent are still raw yet to be unleashed.  The prime players however are being over-relied on. They had to score as well as defend and become role models too towards the younger generation of players. Some are feeling the fatigue and may snap if they do not have enough rest. Hafiz notably,have been tired and so do Akil and Adzmin. They have played in almost every friendly and training and should their endurance fail so would the rest.  As reported by, Maxigencical Corporation.

       A match to forget yet a lesson to remember....   SP was up against NP on Saturday,August 7,  and we were humbled 7-2 by the end of 3 periods. We were shocked by 4 direct,long shot goals and replied by a brilliant run and finish by Dzaki in the first period. We slowly began to wake up in the second period as we began to start controlling the game and slow the pace down a little to suit us. Shots by NP began to lessen and we get more sniffs at goal. However,2 goals were conceded amid errors but we managed to reply again via a fantastic drag shot from Faliq from half-court. It was worth celebrating as we began on a mission to score as well as defend stoically. In the third period, play was intense as fouls were rampant from both sides. Shamil had his stick broken,while Rizal was pushed rather roughly into the boards. Luckily,there were no fights but NP scored another goal which caught us rather unaware. However,congratulations to us as well as NP for giving us valuable team experience for the IVP. HIP HIP HOORAY!  1. Everyone did well just that we sorta wasn't prepared for an onslaught. We werent mobile too n my performance sucked personally. Sorry dudes. 2. Our centre-save strategy worked well. Congrats to all defenders. The NP players were limited to long range shots from the sides. However,they were just too accurate with their long shots. 3. Congratulations to both goalscorers,Dzaki and Faliq. They took their chances and deserved their goals. Three cheers for them! HIP HIP HOORAY!  Next week,a friendly against ITE WEST CLEMENTI will commence at 2pm on Sunday. It will be confirmed as soon as possible and more updates will be posted here. and one more thing guyz. Cut the slack. As Jie Hong had said,we need to be more focused from now on. A loss of focus is equivalent to a loss. Adioz.  Maxigencical Corporation.

      SP GOALIE SEEN AT SERANGOON ROAD DRINKING TANNI WITH GALS!  At press time, a depressed call from a fan of the SP floorball team reported that she had seen Muhd Near Farhan mingling with gals and a friend known only as Tanni-baram. She was upset at the goalie's state as she saw him obviously high on tanni with a huge beer belly taking a taxi from Serangoon Rd. Her name has been withheld to protect her identity and she wish he would be severely dealt with and at the same time be fit enough again for IVP and win honours for SP. -=]admirer kape?[=-  Rumours have also been rife about the fitness levels of the goalkeepers of SP being drastically low. Some players have even given a public outcry that it is unfair that they do not participate actively in warmups as well as physical training. An unnamed player reportedly said " *&%*^&amp;*%$. Those goalies only know how to save balls. When they tired,they sub. They like so relax sia. We train like siao, they train like pussies in a well. *&$*%&amp;*^&%!!!!!!" However, some players  are perfectly fine with it. Another unnnamed player reportedly said that "as long as they do not concede goals like barthez or leak goals like they neva wear pad then ok lahz. aiyah, i no problem one."

      Cheryl Fox LIFE!!  Cheryl Fox have reported that SP floorball players are anxious and restless waiting for the results of the naming of the IVP Squad which is rumoured to be released this week. An interview with Evangelista Toricco failed to give much light to the rumour as he only said that "The IVP squad names will be released soon. I urge all players to still continue training hard for the coming trainings and friendlies to cement your places in the squad. Thank you" Another interview to a senior player rumoured to be part of the TOP SECRET IVP COMMITTEE also does not give much insight to the rumour. "I have said repeatedly to the players that what is important is your performance in every training and friendly. The selection of players and the time it will be released will be left to the committee's discretion. Thank you."  Is it true? Stay tuned to find out...

        SP Floorball Board   It has come to pass that the IVP is coming up in a few weeks. After a series of friendlies and trainings, the IVP players committee has drawn up a draft of players as well as their lines for the coming IVP. Please take note that there is no favouritism involved and all players are selected according to the three criterias' of attendance, desire and level of skill and discipline. The selected players should also remember that they could still be dumped from the squad if they lose their level of discipline. Best of luck to all players and train hard.  Evangelista Torrico Team Manager of IVP Squad.

Damn right i'm irritated!!! *&@*#^$*@&amp;amp;%*#@&$@*#$&amp;@*#$&@#*$&amp;@#*$&^(%)$*^(!@#(&amp;!(@#$%#(!*@$(*#$(@ -=[All these words were censored to ensure all material read are safe for readers age 1- 99.

Some decided to go Mohamed Sultan road for some beer while others suggested geylang for some fun. -=[ehz dei, please refrain from doing these stuffz ahz...]=- In the end, they ended up at Holland Road eating at KFC. -=[Nasib baik nie budak² tau makan makanan yg halal. ]=- Anyway,these dudes were not as good as u think.

       NEWS UPDATE!!! Experimental SP squad beat RP 5-0...-=]Guys[=-    It was a babelicious day as the babes from NP,SP and RP meet at the FC5 hall in SP for combined friendlies. [Sorie..Tanni overdose...] Aniwae,back to the match report...    SP and RP met for the first time as they faced off in a friendly match. Play started out pretty fast with the SP floorballers controlling play well in the centre and defence. RP was struggling a little and it seemed that cracks could appear anytime soon. SP's first goal was a set-piece that worked very well as the positioning of the players were perfect. Adzmin got a free-hit at the corner of the RP goalpost and swung a perfect ball across the mouth of goal. The ever-present Akil ghosted in at the farpost and gave the perfect set-up to Hafiz to half-volley into goal. The crowds roared as SP begin to gain control of the game.    The next period came in fast and powerful as tackles and the pace increased. SP and RP were coping with the increasing pace pretty well as both traded early blows to both goals. However an error by the RP defence led to another goal. A ball was gifted to Jie Hong who then slipped it to Andy who slapped it into goal. GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!! The crowds cheers were so loud it could have brought the whole hall down. Then a few minutes later,Yew Jie scored from a free hit by Kin Leong from the far corner. WOOOHOOOO!!!! SONG BO!!!! wakhakahkahkhakhkha! [Heineken must have been the caused of this error in typing] However,the freshies do not want to lose out in the scoring fest as Faliq did a fancy turn around in front of goal to score a stylish goal. What arrogance yeah?    The third period came pretty smooth as RP played all their players in one line. This proved futile as their endurance began to wane. SP continued with their controlled play and scored against the run of play via Faliq who received a nice ball from the right and whacked it to GOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!! [this is another case of carlsberg swimming in this writer's brain....] SP was overjoyed as RP would find no way into the SP goalmouth. They conceded valiantly and we wish them gd luck in the IVP!!! HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!!!    -=]ehz thambi, i need help in people writing match reports. Any available dei,di,thambi or thangkeci oso can..this writer too high on tanni lahz...thank you[=-
