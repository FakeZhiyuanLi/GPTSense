      With class for July done I get to relax a bit before August classes start Monday. The schedule is a little more forgiving. Actual time between classes for decent nights sleep. However I don't get a weekend's worth of relaxing. My days off are Sunday and Wednesday. I don't like the idea of my days off being split up. I still don't know if I passed Calculus. I'd hate to have to put up with that class again. Even if I do pass, Linear Algebra is thought by the same instructor. No escape from that annoyance. I will miss my Programming I instructor. It was funny and made C++ easy to understand. But from the comments he made about our next instructor, it may still be as entertaining.

      Well I passed my Programming 1 final exam. Considering I passed all my other tests, I passed the course. Next month, Programming 2! I don't know about Calculus yet. I better pass are my parents are gonna give me hell. If I pass it, Linear algebra is next. I'm told it is supposed to be easy after getting through Calculus. I know what algebra is, but I don't know what Linear algebra is supposed to mean.

      In the beginning, Calculus is seems easy. Just move this and convert that, problem solved. This is Calculus! It is easy!  Then...it begins. The horror it becomes. It has sucked in you to a false hope, and then it crushes you. I never really realized this until the most important moment of my Calculus class: THE FINAL EXAM!!!!   If I fail, I'm jumping off a building and taking my instructor with me. I know he put stuff on that exam that wasn't covered in class! I don't remember learning how to find the anti-derivative of COS!

      If you've ever learned or did any programming, you know what I mean. Trying to get something to work that just WONT'! Then after an hour getting the problem code to work on&nbsp;4 lines. It was quite annoying. However, the fact I got it to work it great. In my class so many are looking at failure and it just surprises me. Next month I'll be shocked if even half the class is there. Oh well, I'm passing.

      Well I was supposed to met with my new roommates today, but they never contacted me. Guess they decided otherwise. With that this weekend has been very uneventful. But I got a good amount of sleep and my body has recovered from the stresses of last week. Heh, Saturday my muscles were at their limits I think. Every part of me was stiffening up and sore. I was exhausted. Still, I wouldn't mind another day.

      The weekend is here! I can finally relax. This week has been hell. Next week is my last week for the course month. That means final exams. Calculus worries me a bit, but I think I'll do just fine with programming. But I'm not going to worry about it. I'm just going to lay back and chill.

      Just a stray thought: If you have in-grown toenails, GET THEM FIXED! I had spent 8 years avoiding getting mine fixed. They were badly infected, looked horrible, and were in pain most of the time. But I feared getting them removed! One of my fears: mutilation of my body. Also combines with my fear of needles. Then one day, my cousin stomped my foot. Accident? I still say, "Yeah right! THAT HURT!" But it was the final straw, I broke down and accepted my fate. With the help of another, kind and caring, cousin I got a "off the books" operation on my poor little toes (actually it was the big toes and one little toe). I quaked in fear, agonized over the needles stabbing my toes. A set of two injections in each to numb them. Two toes took 2 sets, the last and worst toe took 3 sets and still didn't stop the massive pain. Once it was all done, I nearly past out (mainly due to my cousin, who was the nurse there, just HAD to show me the bloody nails). Then I had a strange laughing bout, I just started laughing and couldn't stop.  None the less, never let things gets so bad that it requires all that pain to put some sense into your head! Just get it over with, you'll appreciate it.

      You know for some reason my picture never works. The URL is correct to my photo's location, yet Blog can't pull it up. Its kinda annoying. Anyway, the hassle is my car. This afternoon I removed my broken alternator and brought it to an autoparts shop. Got me a new alternator and put it in my car. With a little jump for the battery, my car was up and running again. Battery does need to be properly recharged, but since I needed to get to Calculus for the test today I will do it tomorrow after my Programming class. I still have to find that coolant leak, though.  Speaking of Calculus, I'm glad I only have one more class of it after tonight. I do dread it, plus I never did like night classes. I get home and I feel like I should have hours to just be alone, but NO! I have to sleep right away for my Programming class in the morning. Its hell I tell ya. I'm so tired from all the work I've had to endure the past few days from my car, I just want to relax. Sunday and Monday, my days off....after class tomorrow I can finally relax. With my car up and running I was able to get to the bank! With my cash allowance I get for food in hand, I put some in the bank and kept a bit for food (I hadn't eatten all day and was late for class...I went to Wendy's anyway. FOOD!) So with some cash in the bank, I can finally reactivate my account with Skotos! I like to roleplay and its a great place for it. I love Castle Marrach and The Eternal City they host. Both are MUDs, but they are the best around. Plus I can play Underlight because of Skoto's Partnership program they do with other companies, like Lyra Studios that runs Underlight. Unfortunately, Underlight is getting worse and worse as time marches on. It's so far behind in technology that it is shocking it still is around. Its a roleplaying game, too, but its graphical. But the graphics are over a decade old using 2.5D engine for the environment and sprites for everything else. It was a great game, but as MMO's go you need to upgrade the system before you get 10 years behind everything else. Its too low on players, and only a fraction of those players are even worth playing with most of the time. I'll probably spend more time with Castle Marrach and play a little The Eternal City here and there. Castle Marrach uses a small environment to enhance the social atmosphere. The game doesn't have monsters or anything, its about living in a castle and climbing the strict social latter...or not. Some people choose to stay the lowly 11th rank (which means you have no rank). Rank usually means work, cause you won't have a high rank if you aren't important to the castle. I have two characters: the first is Jonci (original isn't it), a swordsman before finding himself at the castle. He is usually depressed due to the lack of freedom he feels he has trapped in the castle. The other is Syrio, a thief in his life before Castle Marrach and a woman-chaser. During his first week he was rejected 13 times by women! Probably a record! Then he found a strange dark woman that kinda tortured him a couple of times (she put Syrio in the stocks for the promise of a kiss...she didn't deliver). This blog has gotten way off topic and very long, I'm gonna cut it for now and leave something to talk about later.

      Now that the past has been recorded, time to talk about my college life. During my senior year I decided to learn to become a game designer. I've played video games since I was 7, and during those times I kept thinking about what would make a great game. So now I was determined to learn to create games. I started with the programming degree at a local community college. I figured I'd get my associates degree and head for a 4-year college. But I wasn't doing very well and I was having too much trouble grasping my core classes and wasting money withdrawing from the humanity classes. I feared for my future after running scared from my government class. My hopes dwindled with the idea that most college's game design courses were just that. A course, a single class about game design. So when I found Full Sail's advertisement, I looked into the school. Everything they teach is focused on the program. I learn programming in my course program, but it focuses towards game design. With that I seem to be understanding everything alot easier (except calculus. that's just painful). Of course it took me awhile to get things moving. I spent over a year doing other stuff and not getting myself in Full Sail. I guess it paid off in the end. They upgraded their program to a BS degree. Longer and more money to fork for tuition, but a BS is always better than an associates. So earlier this year I came to Florida and toured the place. Got a great look to it and their equipment looked top of the line. Of course I was already set on applying. Two months later I was in Florida. I packed everything I owned into a U-haul and set off. My father took a vacation to help me out considering I only own a car. His truck pulled the U-hail trailer. We unloaded my stuff at my new apartment, I signed all my remaining paperwork, and decided to stay at the resort my father was staying. A little fun before 22 months of constantly work couldn't hurt. On my birthday, May 27th, I registered at Full Sail. The next week I was mostly unpacked and starting school. My first courses were Fundimentals of Game Design and Behavioral Science. Basicly, an english class and a life studies class. GDF was fun, though I had some trouble with my group on more than one occasion. We has a group of 4 and we had to create a game idea and document everything we learned. Problem was Deborah had completely different views about games. Personally I considering myself well versed on what works and sells. She thought Doom was a RPG. A person that doesn't even know one of the most famous games doesn't have enough knowledge on the gaming world to properly create one. Easily proven when her idea was a game where you ride around and&nbsp;get missions to&nbsp;cut people's heads off......I had to oppose that idea. I created a storyline for a good Action/Adventure and we worked on it (except for the 4th member that refused listen to us and did whatever he wanted). In the end we got the highest grade, though I'm glad&nbsp;the game&nbsp;was just on paper. I wouldn't want to actually create it the way we ended with it.  Well that wraps up this and finishes up my life summary story. Later readers.

      With my class today completed and myself safely at home, I think I can take the time to write about my past experiences. Life story time! If my story sounds depressing, probably cause my retained memories are generally negative. My family gives me a hard time about that, can't help the way I remember the past. I'll make it as general as I can. Age 5: My first crush was on a girl in my class. She also lived in the same apartment complex so we were friends. On Valentine's Day, our class had us do valentines. I made mine for the girl, but she wasn't at school that day. I decided to give it to her at her home. When I went over after school, no one was there. Nothing was there. Another kid told me her family moved. I was so heart-broken. Massive emotional scarring, I was recluse for years after that. Fast-forward to age 10, my family moves to Mississippi. Possible one of the worse places in the world if you ask me. During the fifth grade, everything was normal at first. I was just a quiet student that did my work and studies. Who knew that was all the reason for the many bullies to target me. Lets just say for the next&nbsp;5 years my life was a living hell and I was on the edge of suicide. I had to get out that place, so I moved in to my father who was in Arlington, Texas. A great city right in the metroplex of Dallas/Ft Worth. With malls, a Six Flags, everything! (being raised in small cities forever I was severally deprived of the real world). I had a new home, new school, new life! It took everything I was to make such&nbsp;a big decision, especially considering that during my final grade (9th) in Mississippi I fell in love with Lucenda. We even spent a small part of summer at Aviation Ground school together. I questioned my decision to move everytime I saw her, but sometimes one's peace of mind is more important than one's peace of heart. I had three years left of high school and I was going to spend them at Arlington High. They weren't perfect times, but I actually enjoyed those years. Had a few unrequited loves.&nbsp;And I had to&nbsp;maintained myself from doing anything that could put me in my former social position. That's alot of restraint. I like to be witty, but its hard when you have to question everything before you do it. These days I've abandoned that. What happens happens. I act as I wish and don't allow other's opinion of me to effect me. Besides, I have a future to worry about. I can't be worrying how other's will see me because I made some dumb comment.  Well that's all for this topic. I could blame others for my teenage torture, but in the end I know its because I was weak-willed. I allow others to take advantage of me and I shyed away when I should have just thrown a swift punch.

      I like to view my time here in college as an adventure. Ready to face the challenges ahead of me! So when my car decided to curse my very existance, this adventure just got bad. First I noticed my car was leaking alot of coolant. A surprise considering my radiator was replaced only two months ago because that one was leaking. Then while returning to class from our food break, my car suddenly stopped working. The battery was dead. That could only mean my altenator has died (also replaced two months ago, by the same person, my step-father, a pattern?). Well I gambled my chances to get home, I made it half way. Car had to be pushed another 2 miles.&nbsp; Thankfully I got some help from some passerbys. There are good people in the world after all. One of them even offered to give me a ride to class in the morning. With that I'm signing out, 5 hours til I have to wake up. I wanted to write more about my life up til now, but I wanted to rant after today's events. Later

      Hello and welcome to my first posting. I decided to start recording my experiences here for memories's sake (my memory sucks) and to share experiences with anyone following the same path I'm on in life. To start I'll start with some basic info about myself:  My name is Jonci Aguillard, currently age 23. I live in Orlando, Florida attending Full Sail academy in their Game Design and Development course. My religion is Wicca following the eclectic path with influences from the Dianic traditions. I'm a hardcore gamer owning a PS2, a XBox, a Gamecube, and a Gameboy Advance. I'm really into japanese culture and I love manga and anime.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  And feel&nbsp; free to check out my website at  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/jaguillard/   It has&nbsp;a college&nbsp;essay I wrote on prejudice against Wiccans. Also a RPG game I created with RPG Maker 2K. Its only a demo of something I plan to do one day, something ALOT better.   Okay that all I have for the moment. I can always write more later on. Plus it is 3am in the morning and I'm sleepy. Tomorrow I'll write out some of my experiences since moving here to Florida for college. Later!

      When you have an apartment with no power, people tend to come together to ward off the suffering of a blackout. With such, I've turned to my neighbors for entertainment. As written before, I got to met a couple of nice girls. Britney, one of my neighbors, and Ashley, who visits cause of her boyfriend there Jerrod (well so I thought. Read on....). Also there is Casey, who I generally end up conversing with. One odd day in the morning, I go out to find Ashley and Casey speaking outside the apartment. I go over to chat with them, my roommates all still sleeping. They decide to go to the movies to get outta the heat and Ashley invites me to join them. I have no reason to say no, so I go with them. Jerrod shows up and we take his car and drive around. We went up to Aloma street only to find it doesn't go to the Alafaya street. We spent nearly an hour before we turned around. We got to the movies, eventually, and had some time before it started. We decided on food. Casey went to a mexican resturant by himself. Jerrod wasn't hungry and Ashley and I didn't like mexican food. Instead we ended up at the California Pizza Kitchen. By the name you wouldn't think it, but it was a nice fancy resturant. You could tell by the prices. I got a Chicken Ceasar salad and Ashley a soup. My salad was quite excellient. Jerrod went outside to smoke, so Ashley and I got some time to just chat. It turns out she and I have some things in common. And beside her admitted "doting mother" personality trait, she was great. We finished our food and went to the movie. However, it was cut very short by a sudden blackout. So the movie was over and we went home. The next day I hung out with Jerrod and Casey during the night. It was than they told me the two of them were actually gay lovers and Britney and Ashley were a couple too. At first I didn't believe them having earlier been told that Ashley and Jerrod have a trusting relationship and Casey seemingly checking out Britney. Seems that was all just a cover since they all had bad experiences with their former neighbors. I wasn't convinced until the next day when I met their 4th roommate and Casey was still admitting to being gay. With Britney joining us later and still speaking as a lesbian, I couldn't deny their story anymore. How bad was that experience with their last place that they had to create such a elabrate show to make us all believe they were straight? And why suddenly just come out? Maybe this things are just left to be ignored. It is sad that I don't have a chance with Britney, though I'm told Ashley is Bi'. So if she ever breaks up with Britney, I may have a chance ;-). I can't really speak about my roommates much, I've been limiting my time with them seeing as they become more immature without their computers running. And now they are gone, having escape to Jacksonville to get out the blackouted apartment. I'm all alone now...

      With the attack by Hurricane Charley, power has been off since Friday night. For today, I'm hanging out at Full Sail to be in Air conditioning and use the network for the internet. Here's a recap so far:  Friday night the hurricane hits. My roommates and I, and some neighbors too, went play in the turrenical rains. It was fun, until the wind speeds got the rain to stinging speeds. Around 9pm, the power went out. Even with the hurricane having pasted right over, the tempature rose quickly enough. Without A/C, my apartment slowly warmed up. The next day, still no power. I worried that my food would melt if the power didn't get my refrigorator running again soon. The place was as warm as the outside, and Flordia is a warm warm place. Sunday, having suffered a night of Flordia heat I whine about missing all my Saturday cartoon and animes. Surely the power must get restored today in time to watch  Charmed  and  Deadzone.  Monday comes, another night of heated sleep and sweating the night away. Tomorrow I have class again and I can't decide how I want to handle that. Stay home being exhausted already from nights of bad sleep, or go to my A/C-ed college and suffer through Calculus. I choose to go to class, so at midnight I prefer for the hot night again. Tuesday I go to class. I'm barely awake. Our food as long since been ruined so I can't prepare breakfast. Lecture ends and I plan to go to McDonald's for lunch. But right before class ends, the power dies. A transformer blew nearby, taking McDonald's power with it. No lunch....Calculus labs are next. At the end of it all, I head home hoping for power. There is nothing....maybe tomorrow? Now it is Wednesday. I wake up to unbareable heat as the sun is brightly shining outside. I immediately decide I'm going to the movies to escape my torture. IRobot is a cool movie, but as it ends I grimance about returning home. But I need to check anyway....no power. I grab my laptop, and I head straight for here: Full Sail. I have A/C, I have the internet, I have few arcade games (Game design building is fun). But how long must I wait til I have power? Next Blog topic: Hurricane Goodies (the few interesting events that have occured lately)

      Yes I've been living the uneventful life. Nothing to post about, TIL NOW! Well nothing exciting. My mother and father are learning the wonders of IMs, especially Yahoo Messenger. My mother has learned about using Voice chat and now my father is going to buy a microphone to do the same. I swear I'll never get any peace now. Being in game design, I rarely encounter any women. All men....its quite irritating. I've always preferred at least some balance. I just get along with women better. Well after months of separation from the opposite sex, I got to met two woman that stay in the apartment next to mine. I'm pretty sure they are just staying with boyfriends, but it was nice to have any contact. I spoke with them again today, I'm guessing it will turn into a "If we are both outside, lets talk" kinda thing. Often people sit outside their apartments to chat, and lately I've spotted her outside too. Last night her and another were acting goofy and eventually I started speaking with them. Last time I had any contact with a girl my age was during my first month at Full Sail in Behavioral Sciences. Christina, a lovely little mid-western girl. I had a brief acquaintance with her. Long enough for me to build a huge crush on her.  From personal experience, I need very little time to development a massive crush on any girl. I'm the sad hopeless romantic. I surround myself with female friends, and one of them I tend to fall for. But in the end I never make any advances so I'm left all alone....high school was a torture thanks to that behavior. Oh well, tis life.  That's it for now. I probably should check on those two hurricanes heading in my direction. Ciao

      I've returned to Final Fantasy XI at last! My free ISP the apartment provides was crap. Some reason it prevents access to the game. However my roommates are using another ISP. I did some testing to learn that ISP will work and allow me to connect to the game. So I told them I'd help pay the bill to let me use it to. So now I'm playing again. However, I think I'll have to shut down my account with Skotos again. No more Castle Marrach, I just can't play two games at once. And I know I'll put more time into FFXI. I was having fun with Castle Marrach again, and I hate to just drop out again. But sometimes that's just life.

      Its been eventfully dull. Without full time classes, I don't have anything to do. I could probably have more fun if I could rejoin Final Fantasy XI, but my damn ISP is using technology that is blocking my PS2 from connecting. I'm thinking about getting the Window's version now that I have this laptop. I'd get alot better graphics outta it than the PS2. Just need a USP controller so I can play like I would with a PS2. I don't think I could handle the game using a compact keyboard.

      $388 on my car today. The coolant system was repaired. I had a cracked water pump and that was causing my coolant to pour out the bottom of my car.  When I returned home to my apartment, the common area was covered in stuff. The new roommates have arrived. They are okay and socialable. Todd's mother came down with them. She cleaned out all the kitchen and cleared out all the old stuff left behind. Even some year old food left in the frig. A brave brave woman.  Well, in the morning is Calculus again. I've missed 8 hours thanks to the confusion from Full Sail's system. Offically that would be a failure for the class. I'm going to have to get that erased. Tomorrow I guess I better get with a student advisor and see if I cant find some way around all of this mess.

      My schedule listed me for Linear Algebra and Programming II. I took one class of linear algebra and I was on the roster for both classes, I even signed for my books. Now I get to my first programming II class, I've been removed from the roster. Apparently I failed Calculus, so I'm being told. How is it everyone else got their schedules right, yet I was led to believe I was advancing!!! And of course the school website still hasn't even updated its database with my Calculus grade. I must have really screwed up my final exam to have failed the class.

      Today my car ran out of coolant thanks to that coolant leak I've yet to get fixed. One block from home the car overheats and I have to park it behind a Walgreens. And the autoparts store just a few yards away from me...closed 5 minutes ago. So I grabbed my backpack (I just finished class and was heading home) and started walking for an Autozone I know of that's open 24 hours. Probably is its 3 miles away. So for 2 hours I walk to and from. Return trip was rough, my feet were in pain and blistering. I was hauling the coolant too, which just felt like a ton at that point. Eventually I made it back to my car, added the coolant, started the car, and headed home. I went to unlock my door...the key didn't work. My damn apartment had the locks changed again! I walked again...to my mailbox and got my new key. So now I'm home...I don't want to walk anymore.   Added Later : Thanks to my exhausted body and sore feet, I lost my balance and fell down the stairs. It hurt!

      August 2004 has begun. What new adventures await me this month? Wednesday my new roommates Todd and BJ are going to be moving in. I haven't spoken with the third one yet. Todd is going to be attending Full Sail for the game design program. So I guess I'll have to warn him on some of the coming attractions Full Sail has to offer. Like the pain of that Calculus class. Yesterday Olivier moved out. Glad that pothead is out the place. Smelled up the hallway everyday! Noisy and for some reason did laundry EVERY morning for 2 weeks! Always waking me up damnit. I tried to get alot of sleep this morning (plus a little of the afternoon). Mother woke me up with a call at noon. I have no idea why she called cause I brought up every topic. Trying to get back to sleep wasn't happening cause now someone is hammering in the apartment next to my room.  Well that's a nice and randomly written out Blog for ya....Later
