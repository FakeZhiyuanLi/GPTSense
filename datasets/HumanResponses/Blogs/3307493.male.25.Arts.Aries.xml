      from my letter to blog uberlords:   I am a member of two blogs: "The Jerk Store" and "The Poker Tome."  This is great.  But I am also the FOUNDER of The Poker Tome.  As a friendly gesture to get more bloggers involved, I invited my 'friends' to be administrators as well.  Unfortunately, I misjudged the character of one of these 'friends,' and he decided to revoke everyone's admin privledges save his own.  He then changed the name of the blog to it's current crass and desultory title.  I assumed I would have super-user rights as the creator of the blog, but I assumed wrongly.  Is there anything that can be done to restore my peaceful, innocent blog to its rightful owner?  It was supposed to be about poker and poker strategies, but it has turned into a fallow wasteland of craven insults and dunderheaded profanity.

      huh.  well-played.  it appears our forces will have to abandon the craggy, barren wasteland that was the poker tome for the lush, jerky fields of AFCINS.

      Just wanted to post, as a good thing happening to me in poker, that i cleared $100 in winnings in online poker today.  Even more special was the hand that put me over:  Qh-Kh vs...It doesn't really matter (Q-Q-Q-7-10)  So yeah.  I flopped a 4 of a kind.  What made it even crazier was i guess everyone was playing pocket pairs, since people were betting through the roof.  2 other people stayed until the end, where i beat 2 full houses, one off the 7, and the other on pocket jacks.    I won 26 bucks on the hand.

      There's quite possibly nothing worse than losing on the river to a player online named "Robodildo".

      so i was clearly drawing for the flush, right?  i think it is the first time i've won on the river...without the river helping my hand.

      i raised the limit at every possible chance.  everyone else, save 'titanic clown,' folded out on the turn.  he hit his queen-high straight on the river.  the pot was about 48 dollars at that point.  it was my farewell hand, too!

      dedicated to parting the veil since 09 June 2004.  the format is simple.  you post an obscene display of fortune, for better or for worse.  we the members of this proud body then decide whether your fate even qualifies (simple majority).  if it does, we subjectively assign a value to your (mis)fortune, a number between negative 10 and positive 10.  thus you can track your pokarma numerically.  of course, a running total of zero represents balance and discipline.  a high number represents a dangerous reliance on luck.  a low number means you are an awful person.  keep in mind that to qualify, you have to have either 1.) a great hand that you play perfectly, and still lose to a 2.) crappy hand player maniacally or 3.) a even more fantastic hand played even more perfectly.  or something along these lines.  i believe we know them when we see them.  format:   title: your hand v. competing hand  (relevant board cards)  for example.  Q-7 v. Q-Q (7-7-Q-X-X)  or.  Ad-A v. 2d-9d (Ks-Ac-4d-6d-10d)  then the circumstances: 'i bet four dollars with my aces preflop.  feez called me.  i flopped trips, bet five dollars, and feez called me again.  i bet two dollars on both the turn and the river, and feez called me both times.'  then the votes.  'i vote yea and rate it -3.' no matter how irrational... 'i vote nay.  three diamonds after the flop is a great place to be!' 'i vote yea and rate it -2'  my pokarma is -2.5, where feez's blundering pokarma is +2.5.

      I'm sure most of you have already seen something of the kind, but  urlLink this  was pretty helpful...it's a complete ranked list, percentages and all, of all 169 possible starting hold'em hands.  Worth a look.  Also, Joel, what's the full skinny on this tourney tomorrow?  I'm in, but i need to know me some details.

      you can't second guess a winner.  well, you can, but they  won .  the manager that intentionally walks barry bonds with the bases loaded, only to give up a home run to the next batter is an enormous ass.  but if his pitcher strikes 'em out on three pitches, he is toasted as a strategic genius.  the line between brilliance and infamy is thin, winding and nearly invisible.  this is  so  true in poker that it approaches overwhelming.  there are no teammates, no constants, no flawless strategies.  the game requires such a delicately personal approach that extensive study of veteran strategies will most likely leave you confused and inefficient.  for three hours on any given night, you perch yourself one runner-runner away from complete, devouring insanity.  motherfucker, it's great.  see, the ten dollar bet has more grace than comrade klemis gives it credit for.  there is a hyperbolic poetry to that stack of chips, never tossed casually on the felt but always counted, recounted and placed softly, even remorsefully in front of the brazen youth willing to commit so many of his resources to a single endeavor.  the act is so excessive that its beauty can only be matched by two or even three callers.    i rarely make it and seldom call it, but i love the ten dollar bet, that phalanx of red chips marching toward their destiny in the center of the table.  this is not pillow talk at 90 decibles; the potential rewards are far greater (indeed, they actually exist).  this is the suprise press of the finger, thrust of the tounge or nip of the teeth that will either disgust or melt your lover.  calculation and passion rarely meet, but poker and sex always provide a secure location for their illegitimate trysts.    that stranger takes as big a risk making the bet as you do calling it.  this isn't a cautious, one-dollar probe around your rectum; no, this is a spit-lubed finger straight to the prostate.  do you gasp and kiss harder, or do you wriggle free?  it's not about love, it's about satisfaction.  let's cut the bullshit.

      Last night, by any account, was a slaughter. The innocent and meek were separated from their money with frightening speed and accuracy. A lot of it, I think, was just bad calls, the kind of thing you have to get out of your system before you can call yourself a good player.  The question that remains in my mind is: what do you do when you have a solid hand, but not the nuts... and a stranger bets $10 (half your stake) against you?  In some ways, it would be easier if you're playing a drawing hand. Memorize the  urlLink pot odds  and do some quick math. Of course, you have to consider whether you would be drawing to a losing hand -- but still, it boils down to a question that requires intelligence, not intuition, to answer.  (And anyway, pot odds dictate folding to a big bet most of the time.)  I read a while ago that a bet is at its heart one of two statements: I think I'm going to win, or you think you're going to lose. But that's I read a while ago that a bet is at its heart one of two statements: I think I'm going to win, or you think you're going to lose. But that's bullshit. People make all kinds of bets -- bluffs, semi-bluffs, bets masquerading as bluffs and semi-bluffs, bets to gather information, bets to increase pot odds, bets to decrease pot odds, bets designed to make people playing lesser hands feel confident.  It's really a language unto itself, and nobody wants you to understand what they are saying. There's a secondary language, of physical tells and subtextual clues, but you can't rely on it. You have to listen to the way people lie to divine the truth.  The problem with the $10 bet is that it's the equivalent of bellowing "I LOVE YOU!" in the middle of pillow talk. There's no way to know what it really means. Maybe it's just a massive bluff, maybe he's trying to kill anyone on a flush draw, maybe he thinks his kicker will squeak by yours, maybe he wants to establish a presence at the table, maybe he just wants your money, maybe...  So is it a bad call or not? You just don't know, and there are so few things that can help you figure things out.   Related reading:   urlLink Mind Games

      This was Omaha Hi-Lo. I felt pretty good at the turn -- though I was a little worrried of 9-9, everyone had limped in when I bet after the flop. Maybe a few playing a wheel draw or something. The guy who won checked to me on the river, which might have been a courtesy or just timidity.
