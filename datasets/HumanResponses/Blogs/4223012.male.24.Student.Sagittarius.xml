      I woke up this morning when my phone rang at 0755. Looked at the caller id and it was ......... can u guess who... my boss. I was supposed to call her at a quarter to eight to give her feedback about a client I was supposed to meet at 0700. I didn't answer the call of course. I jumped out of bed, rushed to the bathroom and had the quickest shower possible. I then realised that I had actually broken my younger brother's record. That boy would get under the shower and exit before you finished brushing your teeth. I was out of the house the house by 0810. Rushed down to the client's office and blamed my lateness on the traffic. Honestly, there wasn't any traffic on the way. I only live about 3 miles away but the client doesn't know. She does not need to know, its strictly confidential. Anyway, we finished the meeting in no time called my boss later and told her whatever she wanted to know. She did not even bother to ask me why I did not answer my phone when she called. I went back home and had a proper breakfast before going to the office which is on the other side of the world (thats what we say when u travel from west London to east London or vice-versa). I've had a nice day at work today and it's Friday tomorrow. God bless. I will get to know when my friend's wife's funeral will be held tonite or tomorrow. We will and then pay her our last respect before we meet again. Still can't get over the fact that she's no longer with us.

      Should have told you a bit about myself earlier on. I'm married to a beautiful lady by name Claudia. We have a 7 month old baby girl named Breanna.  urlLink    Breanna  urlLink     She's quite a handful. I have been developing a website for about a month now. It's a personal website that has a little bit of everything added to it. So that it doesn't plainly look like a blog site even though I'll blog on it. I have found a server to host it for Â£*** As at now, I am only spending about an hour a day, 3 days a week on the development of the site. I know I need to put in more time if I want to launch it earlier, but the problem is that I ain't got no time. You will get to know me better when its launched sometime next month (hope so). This is how my homepage will look like. or more like it.

      Hmmm. I've always given e-blogging a deep thought, but I think this time I'm gonna go for it. Before I type anymore I would like to observe a minute of silence to my very very good friend, Justice's wife Nana Ama. 1980-2004.  .........30........20..........10..9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1  She died after a very short illness (2 hours) at the Ealing Hospital, London on Sunday 08/08/2004. She left behind her husband Justice and their lovely two year old daughter, Juanita (pronounced " huanita"). Her death is left a very big gap in our hearts. We were like family. I rolled with Justice and his twin brother, Julius, and our wives also did their own thing. We would have dinner together on Friday nites. We used to have our Friday nite dinner at my place but lately we've been having it at Justice's. Now that his wife is gone, Friday nite for us will never be the same. I PRAY TO GOD HER SOUL TO KEEP.  I know this is not the best way to start my blogs but I had to do this. I'll tell you more about myself and what's going on in my head (you wish). Hey! I've got a good deal on a gym membership so I'm going back to exercise after a year and half. I moved from a 34 inch waist to almost 38 in 18 months, even though I only have two meals a day instead of three. But the two are heavy enough to knock Mike Tyson off. Anyway, I heading back to the gym, no turning back.
