      MY fortune cookie said: You will always have good luck in your personal affairs.   I'm pretty damn sure that's a good sign. After what I've been through the past couple weeks, I'm glad to hear it'll all work out - not that I didn't think it would, but still.

      I just got back from a good time. I got to watch my husband in his best movie yet, and I got to enjoy the company of my best friend. (Yes Robert, it was a good, clean, uneventful night.) Does anybody really realize how great Moulin Rouge is?? It's the ultimate love story. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return." I mean....WOW!  There are sooo many moments in the movie where I just squirmed with delight. I'll even admit that I squealed in jealousy at some of the looks that Christian gives Satine.  But anyways, I think the reason I love the movie so much is because I'm searching for the perfect guy - one that can dance, sing to me, and pull off the long, ivory coat like Christian in the last scene. haha - but seriously, I'm looking for some one to sweep me off my feet. I wish everything worked like the movies - If it did, I'd live in a giant elephant decorated with Indian stuff. lol Ok, well, I've been running on about 5 hours of sleep a night, and that's not nearly enough for a growing beauty like me! ;)  Good night all

      In all reality, I'm in a surprisingly great mood! Work is fantastic, cross country is early, but fun, I hang out with my friends, I'm losing my little belly I had going, and I'm going on a vacation to my favoritest place ever! What else does a girl need!?   I'M ALL SMILES!!

      So...Nobody probably even wants to read this, but I want to write it anyways cause it might help me sort things out in my head. Last night, I caused some trouble in paradise. Things were going well, but then I had to go and "express myself" with this gay-ass blog. I still don't think I was in the wrong for feeling the way I did, but apparently somebody,who shall remain nameless, thought my train of thought was way off base.  So here it is - I can't help the way I feel. You're a guy, and you may be able to just snap your fingers and have your attitudes change in an instant, but I can't. I used to have strong feelings for you, but now it's all different. You say I should be happy for you, so I am. You say I should have no feelings of jealousy or resentment, so I give up - you guys are the perfect couple!  ...the couple I thought we could be....

      So....morals are weird. They suck. They keep me from having a good time...Then again, I'm sure they save my ass. See - working with all these new people has forced me to question my morals. I've been asked (several times) to go party with people after work, but my freaking morals tell me I shouldn't, so I pass up the offers. But these people are soooo cool! (and hot!) Part of me really wants to go drink with them, then again, I know I'd regret it. And I got a weird call from a friend today. We don't ever hang out or talk outside of school, but he called me up today just to say hi. While we were talking, he told me that he can't drink anymore. (he's like, the biggest partier in school) So I asked why he couldn't drink, and he said the doctor told him that if he kept drinking, he'd most likely die within the next 3 years - that's how bad his liver is! He told me he was having a hard time trying to figure out what to do on his 21st b-day now that he can't drink. I know it's an extreme case, but it's that kind of stuff that makes drinking completely unappealing. I just can't wait to be 18 when I can go to a club and dance my ass off, but not be expected to get drunk. *sigh*  Morals suck! I just wanna have a good time....with hot boys...lol

      ...I have a crush....and it's not the same person that it's been for, well, forever. *gasp* lol Oh, and he dances! Like, the "You Got Served" kind of dancing!! Isn't that cool?! Yea, he's totally cute. Anyways, there's not much chance that it would ever happen, but we'll see how things go...  And I leave for our cabin in Colorado on Saturday. I'm sooooo excited. You have to understand that this is literally my favorite place in the whole world. I can't wait!

      She was alone on the floor.  She wasn’t even supposed to be over, especially spending the night.  Then again, Sebastian had a thing for breaking the rules.  E knew it wasn’t his place, but his inner seven-year-old tendencies drew him to her side.  A pretty girl, but not like this.  Her cherry-cola hair was strewn about around her head, some pieces falling over her face.  E was sure Sebastian wouldn’t ever leave such a beautiful girl just lying on the floor.  This was a new girl – E hadn’t ever seen her around Sebastian before.  Sebastian had a way with the ladies – something E admired his big brother for. But something about this girl made him curious, almost nervous.  She hadn’t so much as stirred since E peeked into Sebastian’s bedroom.  E stretched out his hand to pull back the hair covering her face.  His hand had barely moved when Sebastian walked in with a thermos of coffee in his hand.  E retreated to his room across the hall as if he had done something to the girl that deserved a beating.   Through the keyhole, his detective work began.  He observed as Sebastian moved the girl onto his bed and woke her with gentle crooning.  When she had composed herself, she departed with a brief kiss for Sebastian and her curvy body hidden under a baggy sweatshirt.  When Sebastian closed his bedroom door, E decided his detective work couldn’t stop there.  He grabbed his windbreaker, and slid noiselessly from his room and down the steps behind her.  Keeping his distance, E trailed behind her down the street lined with tight townhouses.  When she stopped at a magazine vender, she greeted the man by name, and he returned the greeting with a Good day, Becca.  Now he was getting somewhere.  E took his detective work very seriously.  There was something strange about this girl and he would figure it out, even if he died in the process.  She continued down the street with Teen People in her hand.  E found it rather difficult to keep up with her; darting through the crowded sidewalk, moving his still-growing legs twice as fast as her long, muscular legs.  All this and remaining stealthy was difficult for a clumsy seven-year-old. Finally, she ducked into a coffee house.  E would soon find that Becca worked as a waitress in the cozy, dusty-aired coffee shop.  Fortunately for E, who was on a tight schedule, as his parents would return home from their night shifts soon, Becca merely stopped to check her schedule for the week.  While E waited behind a particularly plump man, he watched a car wreck unfold before his eyes out on the street.   By the time Becca emerged from the back room, sirens and screams filled the air with chaos.  Becca casually strolled from the café as if nothing was going on right in front of her.  However, she did take notice of the car that had been pushed onto the sidewalk.  It would have been difficult not to notice.  E was overwhelmed by the goings-on of the busy street.  A seven-year-old couldn’t help but be frightened at the ruckus that was unfolding: an old man yelling about his smashed-up car, a younger woman screaming in pain as the firemen pulled her from her vehicle, sirens, people gaping at the scene.  E didn’t know where to turn, and he had nearly lost sight of Becca.  He bolted toward her and before he realized what he was doing, his hand slid into her slender fingers.  She jumped a little, then smiled at the strawberry-blonde, freckle-faced, little boy staring up at her.  Becca crouched and asked his name.  E Markham, he replied, thoroughly relieved to have somebody there with him.  Becca recognized the name at once and said she’d take him home.   And so they walked, hand in hand, past the wreck, through the thickening crowd.  E was no longer scared.  It was as if Becca made everything better, just by smiling.  As they walked the ten blocks back to E’s house, he learned that Becca had quite a sense of humor.  He could understand why Sebastian liked her so much.  She was able to make E laugh without talking to him like he was a baby.  E got the baby talk way too often.  Oddly enough, Becca didn’t even inquire as to why E was so far from home at such an early hour of the morning.  E was more than fine with that.  He’d rather not have had to explain why he was following her. However, she did ask about Sebastian.  E had nothing but good stories about his brother.  He was the typical little brother: annoying, clingy, and hyperactive, but he was well aware of that, and the first to admit it.  E had an extreme amount of respect for Sebastian.  He told Becca of the times when Sebastian took him bicycle riding.  He even mentioned the nights that Sebastian would read to him before bed, or the thunderstorms when E would run across the hall, and Sebastian would be waiting for him, a warm place in his bed to keep him safe.  Much to E’s surprise, Becca didn’t seem taken aback by these stories.  Sure, E had an undying affection for Sebastian, but E also thought that girls liked his brother because he played football and was popular at school.  E had never known a girl to like Sebastian for being the guy that he knew and loved.  He slowly began to grasp a deeper understanding of his big brother.   As they climbed the six stairs leading to the front door of the townhouse, E asked Becca to come inside.  She agreed and walked comfortably back upstairs, closely following E.  He fully expected her to enter the room opposite his and was prepared to thank her for escorting him home.  But, much to his surprise, and liking, she chose to visit E’s war zone.  She sat on the floor, which doubled as a battlefield for his army men in their Lego forts.  E nearly went into shock when she correctly identified the structure in the corner as the Space Station Command Center 3007.  As the two sat in that small room, E thought he was beginning to understand the meaning of love.  Of course, he’d have to break the news gently to Sebastian.  And here was his chance – Sebastian must have heard the laughter and wanted to check things out.  He walked into E’s room with a look of shock, then, slowly, he smiled.  E was sure that he felt, more than saw, a wink from Becca’s beaming face. Sebastian sat on the bed, a curious smile on his face.  Becca stood, a Lego clinging to the back of her leg, and joined him on the bed.  E sat in silence as Becca explained how she ended up back in the house.  As she talked, E got the feeling that Becca had known he was behind her the entire time.  Now that he thought about it, she had turned around several times as she walked, and each time, she happened to glance at him.  Then he knew he’d been found out.  Either way, Becca didn’t directly say that she had seen him. As E sat and watched them talk, he saw something he had never seen before.  Sebastian was holding her hand.  Sebastian wasn’t the type of guy that held girl’s hands; he was the type that put his hand on her hip or in her back pocket.  E noticed something else, too.  Sebastian was listening.  Actually looking in her eyes and listening!  E had never seen anything so preposterous.  When Becca and Sebastian excused themselves, E felt the obligation to follow up his investigations with one last peek.  He closed his door, looked through the keyhole, and across the hall, Sebastian settled in, Becca in the crook of his arm.  Sebastian pulled a book from his bedside table, opened it, and began reading to her.   No matter what E had thought love was before, he now knew for sure.  Sebastian and Becca were in love.  That was the only logical explanation for Sebastian’s abnormal behavior.  And an excellent explanation it was.      By: me...again!

      Ok, I guess it's about time to apologize for insulting the entire male population. You're not all bad. But it is true that many of you are pretty slimy at times. And John pointed out that girls have their moments, too...LOTS of them, and I won't deny that. I was just a little pissed off about an event that happened earlier in the day that I wrote that entry. So, guys, please forgive me!

      Contained in painted boxes, awaiting the release, by the    dreaded, lethal shot of that tiny, handheld gun. Runner's eyes tracking the dotted road to hell,     past the filthy Port-a-Johns, with that incessant putrid    smell, through aisles of friends and families,    and screaming competitive coaches, up hills, through puddles, over sand grass and gravel.    Past blurs of team tents and faces, clad in brightly colored spandex and super short shorts,    through shin splints, stress fractures, sore muscles, and cramps, the road to hell proves to be a long and painful journey.    Who would have thought - The road to hell as a dotted white line,    On which runners, young and old, waste their lives away, to win a medal, or a lousy number,    A number in the line at the gates of hell.

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....stupid boys.    I'm not really sure what to say on this topic other than how frustrated, jealous, and depressed I am about it all. I won't bore you all with the details.  Girls, I know you hear it all the time, but it's true - guys are jerks. And the worst part is that either they don't realize it or they don't care enough do fix things.  Sorry guys! You all have your moments.

      Ok, I never really understood the attraction to having a blog until tonight. I'm feeling the need to be productive and creative...plus I need some place to let people know how I feel.  I hope everybody's having a good summer. I miss everybody, but I'm so glad to be out of school. For those of you who don't know, I'm working at Chili's this summer. I absolutely love it. I'm constantly surrounded by hot guys and we all get to hang out and talk a lot while we're working. Too bad all the hotties are drunks or they smoke...total turn-off! Anyways, cross country started on Monday. This season is gonna rock. I'm really excited - the best part is being a senior - woohoo! And get this: I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO TRY THIS YEAR!!! Bout time, huh?

      For those of you that don't know, tonight was Zak's concert. He did an absolutely amazing job. I'm very proud.&nbsp;John and I helped out on a few songs, and I think it kind of topped off all of Zak's songs.&nbsp;And we went to WH afterwards, and, as usual, it rocked.&nbsp; There's nothin' better than WH to wind down a night with the group.&nbsp; I have to take my last test tomorrow, so I've been studying all day.&nbsp; As long as I do well on this test, I'm allowed to go on my mission trip. We leave on Saturday, and we're going to Atlanta.&nbsp; I am soooo excited.&nbsp; I need to go clean, pack, and study some more. Catch up with ya later!  &nbsp; Oh, I almost forgot......HOT BOYS, HOT BOYS, HOT BOYS!!!!  (that's for whoever left those comments on posts. thanks for letting me know how much that annoys you! maybe if I keep it up, you'll stop reading my blog *crosses fingers*)

      WOOHOO!! I am totally, 100% finished with my summer reading crap! YAY! Go me! : ) 7 papers completely done...*phew*&nbsp; I'm in a pretty good mood right now.&nbsp; I have some things on my mind, but its all good.&nbsp; I lost both matches in the tennis tournament today, but I also haven't even picked up a racket this summer. I had fun playing, and exercise is always good. (psh! what am I talking about?? *chuckle*)&nbsp; Work was sooo much fun last night and tonight.&nbsp; The hot guys just keep rolling in, and us hostesses have a new thing to keep us entertained. - We make lists. Like, Top 10 lists.&nbsp; For example, it started with a list of why we don't like this one busser.&nbsp; Then we moved onto what we like about each of the bussers, then the hottest Chili's guys.&nbsp; This guy, Brad (who in my opinion is pretty damn cute) was offended 'cause he was only #4 on the list of hot guys. (we wasn't really mad - he was just messin' around) So then we made him a list of why we love him, and the Top 10 reasons why he  should  be #1 on our list.&nbsp; I guess you hafta be there, 'cause we just had such a good time!&nbsp; But now I've been on my feet for about 10 hours, so I'll catcha later!

      For all you AP English kids with Hau, I've already read all the books, and I'm in the process of writing my papers right now. If you have any questions about the books, feel free to ask me.   The key to reading the books:   Medea-  really fast read; you can skip over anything the chorus says, 'cause it really doesn't matter; it's actually quite an interesting story, so I recommend reading it.  Oedipus the King-  fast read, but a little longer than Medea; still an interesting story, and it's worth reading just for the ending cause its so twisted and weird; the chorus actually plays a role in this one, so you hafta read those parts.  Poetics-  don't dwell on anything you don't understand; look for key phrases and terms; write/highlight in the book, cause you'll need stuff marked when you go to write your paper; don't try to read the introduction. it's all pointless blabbering; don't bother looking up the notes either; techinically, you can skip any chapters that don't pertain to the tragedy crap.  Hope this helps some of you!! Let me know if you have questions about the papers or anything.

      I just got home from a marvelous family trip. One week in Crested Butte, CO, and my spirits are flying high. I had such a great time! I went horseback riding with some family friends, and watched Rick fall off his horse (Tubby, LOL); our dog almost went over the waterfall by our cabin; I ran in the 1/3 marathon on the 4th of July (at 9600 feet, nonetheless); I read 5 books, most of which I actually enjoyed; we hiked, built fires, shopped, etc. And all of this went on surrounded by the Rocky Mountains. Good Goosh, they are sooooo beautiful! Well, now that I'm home, I have stuff to do...no more relaxing! Catch ya later guys!

      Ok, this blog seems to be getting me in all kinds of trouble. I just can't seem to shut my mouth. All I'm doing is running my mouth because I'm frustrated with people. I swear I'm not psycho.   Honestly, I'm really in a great mood. I promise. All the stuff I put on here is just what's going on in the background in my head - you know, the stuff most people don't talk about. I'm just willing to express myself, and people don't like it. So maybe I'll just stop.

      FUCK!!! I swear I'm too nice for my own good. I don't even know why I bother. I'm going out of town on Saturday, and it's a good thing. I need a break from all the fucking drama and shit that's been going on.  I love my job. I love the people I work with, but the shit I've been through with my other friends makes me want to give up my reputation in my group of friends. I just don't want to care any more. I want to go party. I want to get drunk. I want to MAKE OUT WITH A HOT GUY!!!!!! I wish I could just let loose every once in a while.  But you must realize that if I did all that, I'd be shunned, and reprimanded by my own friends.  I guess we'll just see what happens. So what if my reputation as a "good girl" gets screwed over?? It's not like I'm gonna get smashed every night, anyways.   Whatever. All I know is that I'm in a pissy mood until I get to work - then I'm bubbly, perky, and just generally happy... and not just because it's my job to be perky.   Jerks just piss me off...

      I got the answer to my question.  His name is Sloth.   I'm soooooo excited about this weekend!!!! My parents leave this afternoon for Colorado.  My brother's at college, so I have the house to myself!! See, me and Kate were gonna have a party party, but we decided to do something a little different.  All the girls from church are going to come over for a formal dinner party.  Me and Kate are making a 5 course meal,  and we're gonna use our good china, and eat in the dining room and everything.  And, of course, everybody will be wearing formals! It's gonna be so fun/funny.  I wanna go to a movie at the mall after dinner, while we're still all dressed up, but I'm not sure if the others will go for that idea.  Anyways, they're spending the night, and we're just gonna stay up and goof off all night. Then, On either Thursday or Friday, I'm going down to Norman for a tennis tournament.  I'm gonna stay with one of my friends, Jen, in her sorority house.  It'll be a lot of fun.  Oh, and my bro is letting me decorate his frat house room, so I'll get to chill over there for a while with all the guys. ; ) hehe.  AH - today we found out that XC practice is at 6 am starting next week.  Atleast it's at school.  And directly following practice, we have band from 8-930.  On days that I work, I'll probably hafta go straight there from band.  I'll have one busy week! I'm gonna help my parents pack the car so I can get them out of here!!! woohoo!  : )

      So, this weekend was soooo much fun! Me and Kate are a dangerous combination.  We were online talking about how bored were, when Kate said we should make a magic potion to cure boredom.... So, I took it literally, and we went to Wal-Mart and bought ingredients for our potion, and went back to my house.  We made our.... potion.... with.... some stuff.... LOL.  The energy drinks are really what got us going - DONKEY KICK!! (but only Donkey Kick Lite or Kate hahaha).  I can't say much more on that topic, but let's just say we were extremely hyper.  So we went driving around (probly not the best idea lol), looking for hot guys, and we ended up back at my house.  We tried watching a movie, but we couldnt sit still through the first 5 minutes, so we scrapped that plan, and went for a walk around my neighborhood, doin' random stuff. That was Saturday.  Sunday was Mission Trip Sunday.  It went really well.  Craig's sermon was really good, and I didn't think I'd ever say this, but I'm really gonna miss that kid!  AW - the slideshow almost made me cry.  The comic relief is the only thing that saved me.  I just got drawn back to Atlanta, and I wish it had never ended.  I don't want to graduate and leave behind the opportunities for trips like that.  I'll never ever ever forget Atlanta and everything that went on there.   AHHHHHHH - FUCKING NICK NOBLES!!!! I want to rip his pea-sized balls off!!!! I was having a fantastic day, until I was leaving the sanctuary, and Nick, who wasn't even on the trip, brought up the worst, most horrible, embarassing, disgusting, and degrading thing I've ever experienced.  I don't wanna talk about it anymore.... Just a warning to those of you who know what happened - DO NOT EVER JOKE ABOUT IT WITH ME  So, after church, all the youth went out to lunch, except for Vic.  We went to Garfield's, and I got to pretend it was my birthday! haha  I love the fact that all of us can hang out outside of church now.  It's so cool!  It just goes to show how powerful Atlanta was - even if the others weren't spiritually changed during the trip, we're all closer now, and I know that for me, that will make it easier to grow in Christ.  Ok, back on topic now - all the girls stayed after lunch and walked around the mall, and we ended up trying on Homecoming/X-mas dance dresses.  Stacey picked out some gorgeous gowns for us to try on - HAHA.  It was just a good time....  Peace, love

      Okay, I went on a scurrvenger hunt last night with some girls from church. It was such a blast. We just raced around town doing stupid tasks for a given amount of points per thing.  There was one task that I got lots of points for, but I much rather would've done it a little differently.  I won't go into detail... but I wish I had the courage to.... do what I should have done... Anyways, my team, the FREAKCRAZIES, won the scurrvenger hunt by a lot, and it was just a really fun night. Band camp started on Monday.  This year is going to rock.  Our music is so much fun. Elvis rocks!  = )  It's been kinda hard to get up in the mornings for cross country, 'cause I can never seem to make myself go to bed before 1 am.  Then I'm up all day, and I'm always hyper  by lunchtime, so I'm worn out by the end of the day.  I'm really excited about things this year.  Oh, and me and Kate made a pact... can't go into details, but it may be difficult to complete.  With any luck, I'll be all set for school, but we'll see how it goes.  (but it would have helped to have done the scavenger hunt task how I should have!!!)  Ok, I'm gonna let it go now  BYE!

      As Patricia would say, this trip was my lightbulb.  My eyes have finally been opened to the world of faith.  This week alone has taught me more about Christ than the past 10 years of Sunday school and Confirmation class.  You really had to be there, but the whole week was just amazing.  I wish I could tell you everything that happened, but I guess that will just hafta remain exculsive to those who were actually there.  I will be posting a list of all the inside jokes and funny moments.  I always wanna remember them, and I love making people confused about inside jokes.  Anyways, that'll be up in a few days, and for now I'm off to ponder.  (I finally know what I wanna do with my life, but not specifically, so I wanna figure it out)
