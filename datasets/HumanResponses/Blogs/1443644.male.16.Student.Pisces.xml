         You'd expect that this post would be about making money. Well, you are wrong. You see, this summer was supposed to be about making money, but it hasnt happened. My boss never calls me in, leading my parents to believe that i am wasting away my summer. It really appears that way, but it isn't my fault i listened to my boss and kept my summer open so i could work for her. Man, this sucks! So today i woke up early, didn't feel like getting out of bed, so i layed in bed for about three hours. I then got up and got ready for my big day... Of doing nothing. After I drank a bottle of water i was inspired to take advantage of the beautiful weather and go for a walk down town. My walk was very energizing, and motivating. While downtown i went to Dunkin Donuts and got a vanilla bean coolata before heading down to Subway for a BLT without the T. Over all it was a wonderful adventure. I saw Jaimie K infront of Adams, I was so happy to see her, i have't seen her since the end of school, which really sucks cause she is a great person... i miss her, her Hooters shirt, and her poncho so much! Walking along the streets of Monson really helped me do some deep soul searching. I realized that i really don't like BLT's, even if there is no T. I also realized that i am very confused when it comes to making decisions about my future. I really have to start thinking about colleges and various areas of interest that i wouldnt mind dedicating my life to. I don't know what's going on. I have felt extremely lonely lately, and just so out of it. Anyways, I had rehearsal for Summer Theater again this evening. Another night filled with dancing my heart out, man i can't wait for it to end.  *I just wanted to appologize for last night's post, i was having a rough evening and had to vent. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, or cause any hooplah.

        Actually, I do not have one at the moment, but I am sure that I will in the coming days. As you all know (unless you have been living in some underground world) it is summer, and summer holds no secrets, and nor do I. The past month has been less than uneventful, but I will give you a quick summary. I started my summer off in Cape Cod with my cousins, it was fun, but they kind of were too busy oogling the locals while I was left oogling nothing cause Ptown is like the gay capital of the world, so there were very few girls, and the ones that were there were drag queens and lesbians. Now don't get me wrong here, I am not a homophobe or anything, I was just pissed cause there were no girls that I&nbsp; chill with... There never are. Once I got back from the Cape I was off to Maine for the fourth of July. It was kind of fun, but my friends from New York also dumped me, but this time for tourists, which is even worse then the locals! Once again I was alone, because Ogunquit is also known for its gay and elderly population, and I do not like my ladies wrinkly... Man, I always get hosed when I am on vacation because we never go places where there are straight people my age of the opposite sex! Well, anyways... I have been home ever since. I crashed a few parties, but they were more or less drink and run because my parents all of a sudden need to know everything (since Joanna's party... which I forgot to tell them I was staying over for). Other than that things have been pretty uneventful... I went to the mall with Kelsey, that was an adventure... I also went to the mall with Sam, but she kind of decided to hang out with her friends/cousins that were there, leaving me kind of out... I am always the odd wheel out! Why can't I have someone to even things out? Why cant I find a girl who wants to be more than just friends? I already have enough "just" girlfriends, and it is beginning to suck because all I really want to do I have someone who is... Mine. I have had my eye on someone for years, and I cant seem to remove them... Which is really holding me down, but then&nbsp; again, I haven't really been attracted to the other choices... I am afraid to make the first move, because I am unsure of her status, and I don't want to wreck our growing friendship. Why does this world have to be so unclear?

        Lonely. It is always nights like these that make me feel so alone. I mean, I have friends... Well, I think id do, but there are so many times when you think people are your friends until they never call/talk to you online all summer... It is a major bummer cause you love spending time with them, but it just isn't "real." Tonight, sitting here at my computer, I feel so alone. I always get these nights where I am home, alone, and wishing I had someone to talk to, or to just hold. This post seems like it has been discussed in previous posts, but it is just a reocurring problem! At the end of this week, I will be heading to one of the loneliest places on earth, Ogunquit Maine. It is always hard for me when I am up there because that is when you really know you are alone... No one calls you, no one is there to hang out with, there are only tourists who are not interested in me... It sucks, and I hate going up there, but I feel it is better to be alone there than here. I mean, if I am going to be alone, I want to be completely alone. I spend so many nights on the beach, sitting there listening to songs that make me feel even lonelier, but it just really shows me what life is/can be like. Those nights I don't come home until the wee hours of the morning because I have to regain my composure. I feel as if I am lying to myself, to the world, when I say that everything is all right. I mean, it is, but it isn't... So much stuff. I am not sure... Once again, I feel as if I should stop before I say something that could be taken in the wrong way, or something I wish I could take back.

        Well, after promising myself, and my readers that I would write in this damn thing as much as possible I realized that I have failed myself, as well as you. I have had so many things on my mind lately and it is just slowly driving me crazy (to say the least). So much has happened since I made my last confession, so much that I have forgotten most of it. I spent a few nights at Jordyn's house watching movies, and hung out with Katie, Gennie, Monica, and Jordyn off and on. I traveled to Boston with Monica, and had rehearsals for summer theater... Things had improved for about a week, but they went back to normal last night when two people "reunited," but it was good while it lasted... I honestly don't feel like writing right now, because I might say something that I may later regret... Wow, that is a first, usually I just say it, but oh well... More will come on this topic later, when I have better spirits.
