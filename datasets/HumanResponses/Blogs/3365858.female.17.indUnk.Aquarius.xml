      Wonderful is your presence and  your presence is such a wonder to behold.  To experience and to ponder you,  is in my life a wonderful present  and a proof of wonders undying  presence, too, in this great presence we call life.   The best you bring in our friendship  is friendships best offering  the caring, the concern and the loving  that you show eases suffering and sorrow  withering away life's worry for the morrow.   You are the inspiration that waters the  fire of undue desperation,  you give hope that fuels the vision of the lame  to cross the threshold of imagination and liberate  himself from shame.  You are an angel and a fairy into one truly a blessing to anyone  truly a "belle" who is the only one.   Let our encounter naturally unfold  and bring forth a mutual growth  in ways always good and manifold  Let our connection be a source of  mutual gaiety, always innocent and young  and never be bothered by fancy thoughts in excess.  Let our friendship bear fruits of wisdom  and flowers of freedem, too.  That it may bloom and propagate,  and add beauty to the world we shared and knew.   The togetherness that we share  may it be a living memory in our  separatness, that even when we are apart  our oneness will not depart.   I in YOU and YOU in ME...  the "just" way.

      still cant fight the pain inside, i can forever hide. we had a bind, i thought they'd never find, but i was stupid for being blind! not really seeing his whole being. a fucking fag who'd carry my bag. sure it was sweet, but i could crush him with my feet! he said he loves me, but in the end there was a fee. being with him was like a laser beam, killing me softly, and  it made me feel heavy. i just hope i find that kind of bind, i for long have in mind!  04/09

      oh so much pain,  that i have gain, in loving someone, whom i thought was the one. but i was wrong, not hearing the gong, to wake me up, in the world i made, that in a blink it all will fade. why does it have to be this way, i can never be gay? happy as i can be, it just has to happen to me. loosing someone i thought would never be gone.  04/09

      two different faces,  and two have a lot of differences. one is good, smart, sweet, funny and all that, other is same but ain't all that. so much love given to one, cant take back what has been done. just trying to think and realize, there's no such great prize. having the other not like the one. talking through the phone, and talking in monotone that feelings are not being shown. maybe i should just be alone!  04/07

      so far away from home, laying on a bed that's not my own. it's so boring, have nothing else to do, but just sit here and think of you.  iam even more confused now, cause of all that thoughts that go around. my feelings for you, surely say i like you, but all these thoughts, are giving me doubts. it still is only like and not love, that iam feeling for you. cant really understand why, like i just wanna die. in this white room i look around, making me feel like hitting my  head on the ground.  04/07

      here alone in my room, just laying here on my bed, and thinking of the memories we've had. it already has been 10 months and a day, since we lost in our game. i have nothing much to do, but just lay here and think of you. why does this have to be this way, cant it just go away?  too much pain involed, in falling in love, with someone like you, i call my boo.  i'll never forget the things we've had, even those that have gone bad. will stil wait for that day, that you promised you'd forever stay.  08/22

      i finally realize, the things i fantacise. those i had to earn, only with you i'll learn. you really taught me a lot, forgive me for having to forget, all the things you did and said. now atleast i understand, you were here to lead the way, to wake me up, show my face, not to hide. i knew you'd always be by my side. iam really greatful of meeting you, an encounter i never knew, would open my eyes of all the things i fantacise.  04/19

      shortly after we had talked, i kinda felt that i have lost. i dont know why i had to feel that way. cant say iam confused, that word is just so used. its not what i think iam feeling, though i think iam still healing. today is the day, i once was gay. happy with a guy only i thought was fly. you know, he never stopped making me cry. but he was my guy,  this day he didnt make me cry. he took me out, brought me for a ride. for people not to see us out together, we went to a place we knew  they would'nt even bother.  i dont know how all this talk  connects to the things about us but just to let you know,  this really is the cause.  04/22

      why do i feel this way? i miss you so much, that i have nothing else to say. this feeling iam having inside, when will it subside? i have to get over you, what else can i do? i have done a lot to forget, but the thought of you just  keeps coming back  all around my head! i still feel the same, you think iam insane. its not my fault, i cant change my heart. it chooses you,  even if it makes me a fool!  04/18

      still confused of what to think and feel, its literally making me ill. i really dont know why, i dont even cry. my feelings for you are so true, am i not see through? dont you see whats in my heart? you're hitting it just like a dart. i cant understand myself, i like you a lot but still haven't fallen in love. you have to do something, seems like you wait for me to do things. if you think i demand a lot, i cant change that. that is who you are and this is me. maybe we are just not a match?!  04/17

      iam sorry our talk had to end that way,  i really did not know what to say.  i badly want you to know,  but iam scared thinking you would'nt understand.  these things are out of hand.  you might even get mad.  now iam confused on whether to tell you or not.  letting you know is like being in a bow.  tied in a knot,  you woud'nt even know.  if i let you know,  please dont think iam letting you go.  i really just want you to be in the know.  that my wounds are still not healing,  all these thoughts and feelings  iam still dealing.  actually i want you to know  so that you'd do something,  for me to start a new begining.   04/22

      look at the date, this is the day we thought about our fate. the first day we were out alone, you brought me so far from home. officially its been a year, since we never really thought of fear. being caught was that bitchs fault. now its the same date, month, and day, that both of us were gay. walking on that stree, its was so quiet, i could hear my heart beat!  i think you dont know that i still love you somhow, can never forget all the things we've had, even those that have gone bad. i gave my all, i think that was my fault. now i cant get back, it all was in a pack. nothing left here with me, so what about the other he? iam guessing you're keeping it, because you're still thinking that we fit. but if that is the case, why not show me your face?! i loved you so much then, what you dont know:  i'll always love you till i dont fucking know WHEN!  04/21

      i look at the time, its three hours past nine. everything is just fine! but this is what i hate, it is already late! i cant sleep,  and i dont know why i wait for my phone to beep. just waiting for a call,  iam starting at a doll. i cant stop thinking of you,  all these are so true,  dont you have any clue?!  cant chose anyone to be my boo. i really cant pick who. i dont understand myself, i feel so small just like an elf! so confused, i feel that you are disgust. it really is not a fuz if i give you a buzz. iam now hearing, the songs i everyday keep playing. why do you act like this? you never want to talk to me, you really are that pist? nothing i can do but just wish and hope, of having the happiness with you, just like being doped!  05/10

      it started with you,  and so it has to end with you,  thats the way things should be.  we already had talked,  i thought it would all disapear,  all these things i fear.  loosing you is not about just a few,  you were once my boo.   probably i'd never really have  the chance to understand,  the man i thought was glad,  of having me even just to hold his hand.  now that we had our talk,  he can easily say:  "i dont remember the walk!"   everything that has been said  and done is now all gone.  i had apologised a lot,  i believe being caught  was none of my fault.   never did i indend to give you so much pain,  trust me it will not give me fame.  you think it is all just like a game,  one looses and one wins.  iam not here to be playing any game,  i just want to feel the same.   05/09

      i dont think i'll ever understand, why you're thinking not to be by my side. i had wished a lot that we'd never part, guess i was stupid to have followed my heart. i know i said i'am over you somehow, but i know you know i can never break my vow, of staying with you all my life. i've said that so many times. if you dont want that, i'd understand, but all i ask of you is give me a hand. please dont think am being desperate, all am doing is following my fate. iam over somethings, but there are things that are just hard to forget. especially the first time we coincidentally met.  you said a lot of things, those to i cant erase, you said them straight to my face. i dont know what else to say, you just might end up pushing me away, all i want is for you to stay.  05/04

      yesterday we've talked,  and you said that you'd call. you did call the next day,  but what a time to call, it was already late. you said that you slept at ten, eleven was the time you called jenn. we did'nt really talk much, then after a while you said you want to go. iam sorry to say, but that made me feel in a negative way. is there something wrong? i really dont know. i called you back, but you did not answer. you know you still confuse me. it makes me think of the past he. i dont want it to be this way, i cant wait for the next day. i'll wait for your call,  again will easily make me fall! just for you almost anything i think i'll do, dont you know? dont you see? i've fallen for you, but i really dont know what to do!  04/28

      i sit here on this chair, if you see me, i'd give a blank stare. i dont know why i feel like this, i've got myself confused and shit. i'am waiting for your call, that tomorrow we are going to the mall. i dont know why i had to fall. its all true, i just dont know about you. i really dont feel what i think iam supposed to. iam guessing you lack in what you should do. you said you'd call, but again you forgot. everything about you is confusing, so what is it that you plan on doing? i feel this way, i got nothing more to say.  04/24

      after a week has passed,  i have been not thinking of our past,  but you bring it up like saying it will last.  you keep playing yet i keep entertaining.  YOU i'll never be getting.  i fall so fast yet it never lasts.  you're hurting me to much,  dont you get that?  i wanna stay as a friend,  but i guess you dont see me as one of yours.  what really is your intendeing?   we talk on the phone,  all you talk about are your clones.  having kids and making them in to a replica of you.  you keep telling me of wanting to have kids.  what really is it your intending?   such an ass,  i see that a lot,  but i dont feel the same way.  they always say the opposite,  i dont know what i should follow.  i keep falling to the otherside,  sometimes holding myself back.  emotions are to strong,  cant see the difference of whats  right and wrong.  what really is it your intending?!

      another night iam just here laying on my bed.  cant sleep and i have nothing else to do,  as always iam just thinking about you.  i've been having the weirdest dreams  lately, dont know if it relates to you.  we got to talk again after what felt  like a real long time.  i feel that you are acting like that time,  when you said you were not feeling fine.  dont know if this feelings iam having are true,  maybe its giving me a clue.  should i or should i not be with you?!   05/20/04

      cant stop thinking tonight, all these feelings are picking a fight! feel like just getting the phone to call, thinking i can easily make you fall. everything feels like that day, the same way, just like it was yesterday. cant fight these emotions inside, its too much, so hard to hide. i wanna have a nice conversation with you, and if we do, it will help me not feel so blue. i cant think of what more to say, only you can make all of these go away. here iam again writing on my pad, remembering all the togetherness we've had. i just wish i could be with you right now, but to get to you i really dont know how!  05/12/04

      after everything that they had done, took everything and now he's gone. hard to forget of all the effects, made by so called "perfects"! they are always there to keep the distance, no other choice but to follow their resistance. &nbsp; when is the time i ask myself, that the great happiness will be felt. cant wait to get out of this cell, this place is worse than hell! staying is just like dying. all you're dreams will start fadding. nothing left for you to do, but just end up crying. &nbsp; after everything that they had done, took everything and now he's gone. hard to forget&nbsp;of all the effects, made by so called "perfects"! they are always there to keep the distance, no other choice but follow their resistance. &nbsp; favoring the other more, too far away cant reach the shore. what is it the others do, i can never get a clue. perfects never see the better side, they only stick to their own kind. &nbsp; after everything that they had done, took everything and now he's gone. hard to forget of all the effects. made by so called "perfects"! they are always there to keep their distace, no other choice but to follow their distance. &nbsp; 07/11 &nbsp;
