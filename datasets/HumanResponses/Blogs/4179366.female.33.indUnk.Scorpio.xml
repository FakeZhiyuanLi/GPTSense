						   Today I will be working on photos that I have worked on in the past year, here in Jersey. I have done a few headshots for models. As well as nature and landscape. I am not sure of what I should do next , because editing my site takes quiet a bit of time. Nevertheless,  I will be working through-out the day of acheiving this goals.  More photos are also added in my group, but I am wandering if I should just minimize most of the photos.
