       My records indicate that I may be making $200 a week, not the $100 I had initally calculated.  This is good.  Very good.

       First off, I'm finding out everyday that my blog readership is much higher that I initally belived.  Welcome and thanks for your interest, I hope I'm not  too  boring.  It was my birthday today, not like anyone noticed (this comment will invariably be followed by a flood of people wishing me a happy birthday).  But I really don't care, it doesn't mean much to me anyway.  What I want is the right to sign contracts, the right to get a credit card, the right to vote, the right to not half to conceal my age to the half a dozen agencies I do business with.  But that won't come for another year.  17 brings R rated movies, but I mostly watch pirated DVD downloads.  Anyway, I'm in a great mood for no particular reason.  I got a CD in the mail that I had been waiting for a while, it's the first music CD I've bought since I was in the 7th grade.  My recent taking for internet radio lead me to an obscure, Seattle-based band known as Level, that vaguely reminds me of Linkin Park on one of their songs, except different.  I had high hopes and my expectations were exceeded.  Also the fact that we have a vacation day Monday might have something to do with my recent plesant demanor.  Online business is flourishing.  Except that I am constantly out of stock of my most popular product (512 MB xD Card) and I'm shipping things that should have been shipped two weeks ago.  For now, life is good.  I think I'm really starting the enjoy the life I'm living, for now.

       You know you're a CCNA student when:  1. You get excited about adding extra "nodes" to your network 2. You can't wait for your Cat 6 cable to arrive in the mail 3. You're always looking for another excuse to install another switch somewhere 4. You know what 802.3 is 5. You know the bandwidths and ranges of 802.11a, b, and c 6. In your house you know whether each line is Cat5, 5e, or 6 without looking 7. You have more than two things connected to your Cable/DSL router 8. You know that Linksys is owned by Cisco Systems 9. You know that your cable modem is slightly faster than a T1.  Things are good - my dad ordered a Dell for himself and now I get to rewire the entire upstairs for networking.  Fun!

       Well, it looks like we have tomorrow off, so I'm up late.  I've decided that it really would be nice if I could find another girl that actually has some interest in politics.  I haven't had much luck thus far, but that's probably became I don't know where to begin.

       Another day, another fight amoung my family.  So far we are 4 or 5 for the last 7 days in this house.  My final grades are going to suck and there is little I can do about it.  I was not a member of today's altercation,  but I was somewhat the subject of it, making the situation little different.  On the upside, I negoiated a free suround sound system (or something else of similar value if I want it) for my room as compenstation to deal with all of this fighting and chaos.  But I question whether items of physical value can make up for emotional pain and suffering (though I guess that's somewhat the idea behind the tort system, so obiously for some people it does).

       I am now questioning why I wrote what I just did.  And I think I know the reason - I hope that through some miracle that me writing about this girl will bring her back.  And I know deep down it won't, but I try anyway for some reason I can't explain.  I dropped the whole issue six months ago, and I don't know why it's comming up now, but I think it had something to do with the State of the Union, and seeing her away message, and remembering how much fun Washington was.  If only there was someone else in Barlow that was like her.  If only I was able to meet people out of Barlow.  If only I lived in Greenwich.

       I want to get out of here.  I can't stand the total lack of freedoms.  My parents are stalling on allowing me to get a car (even when I have the money), my grades are falling because of my dad's policies, and in general, my family life sucks.  I do nothing except surf the internet all night on my laptop and write and work on my eBay business.  I agreed to take an SAT Prep course on the condition I would get to take to car to Fairfield as long as I want to, and now, the night before my first class, my mom tries to reneg on  the deal.  And while I won the argument and got the car (at the expense of my sister who will be stranded at her ballet school for an hour), I wasted a lot of time arguing and now I can't nearly get as much productive done stuff as I would like to tonight because I am so tired, and then I'll end up doing it tomorrow and it will impact my finals, lowering my grades, reducing my chances of early sucess in life, and making my dad want to impose further restrictions because of lowered grades.  And then my grades will get lower because I will hate my home life, and so on and so forth until I'm misserable and my grades are so low I can't get into any decent college, and so I will continue to be unhappy.  Life sucks.  All I want is to be sitting in a room, sitting next to that girl from the DC trip, watching the State of the Union, and making fun of Bush.  That's all I want now, that's all I've ever wanted.  Just someone in my life who means something.  My parents are opponents at the negotating table, my teachers are people who have lost faith in me because my grades have fallen and I can't tell them why, the administators at school are people to whose eternal mission is to oppress student rights, my clients are people who take my time and give me money, they are all pawns on a chessboard, and I can move them at will, and their significance is such that they can be discarded at will also.  They mean nothing, they are just people to be moved around on black and white squares so I can be at least somewhat satisfied with my life part of the time.  Oh, to only be sitting there, in front of Bush, with that girl - no, she has a name - with  Emily , to be sitting there watching that horrible State of the Union address, or to be discussing the results of the Iowa primary, or the affect of the Iraq invation on middle-east relations (which given her liking for international affairs would probably be the prefered topic), it would be worth everything I have ever worked for, to finally have someone that means something to me.  To just see her again, to see her face just once more to remind me of what I'm mising, to remind what I left behind that night in mid-July.  To remind me that my panic, my inexperience, cost me what could have been the relationship of a lifetime.  Everyone always says that the people from Greenwich are rich and stuck up.  But everyone I have ever met from Greenwich I have been able to very closely relate to, like no one else at Barlow.  So I always assumed that I just wasn't meant to live in Easton, that I should have been 30 miles down the Merritt Parkway, not far from where my dad grew up and decided that Greenwich wasn't for him, he wanted to be away from the rest of society in a little town no one had heard of called Easton.  But maybe the kids from Greenwich are stuck up, or at least she was, because I never thought that I deserved this:  (23:32:13) AMDFolding8000: hey emily, it's ross from washington  (23:35:06) AMDFolding8000: you there?  (23:35:34) Bean2brain logged out.   And that was it.  She blocked me, and with a few clicks of a mouse a 30 miles away, ended any chance of me finding a girl that I can truly relate to in high school, unless some twist of fate lands me away from Easton.  In those few clicks of a mouse, she ended my high school social life.   Note:  I have taken the risk, as I did once before on a similar occasion, of posting her actual screen name.  DO NOT IM HER!  I cannot risk ever contacting her again.  She made it clear she does not want to have anything to do with me, and to violate that could give her reason to consider legal action (which, however unlikely a possibility, I have to consider after my previous experiences).  If I thought I had a chance to make an appeal to her, I would have by now.  But last time I tried to appeal to a girl I liked, it ended (eventually) in uncontrolled disaster, and I literally cannot afford that again.

       I've finally decided I need to part with the huge collection of junk CDs I've been storing since the mid-nineties, always promising myself that I'd send them off to get recycled.  Well, I finally am.  So before I send them off, if any of my blog readers have junk CDs at home (be they data, music, burned CDs, AOL CDs, scratched, or otherwise), I encourage you to collect them, let me know that you have them, and bring them in on Monday for me (or if there are far too many I can pick them up).  I'll make sure they'll soon be on their way to be shredded, melted down, and transformed into something else.

       The student activist is back at work.  Right now, I'm looking into a complaint about the management of Barlow parking, so if you have any complaints about the system feel free to e-mail them to me at nizlek@ngcomputerhelp.com.  I'm also running an article on the new mission statement banners (yes, there are two - I noticed a second one in the area of the guidance office entrence this afternoon), so if you have any comments on that, I'd encourage you to e-mail me, and you might get quoted (if you want).  The British Pound rose today, too bad I converted over all the new payments yesterday.  Well at least the high rate will be locked in for the weekend.

       For the moment, everything is working out, and I'm in a good mood for the time being.  I'm implementing an outsourcing program for my company, and I've finally compiled the last week of international sales onto a spreadsheet, and so now I actually know that I'm making money.  It's only about $60/week, but that is pretty good, considering I only have to put in 2-3 hours a week doing it, and I don't have to leave home.  And $60 a week times 52 weeks a year is $3,120 a year, which is a nice source of income in addition to my computer consulting.  Plus I can always expand into other items when I have some more time.  The downside to international shipping is that your income is determined by exchange rates (when the value of the British Pound rises, like it did today, that makes my day) and you have to ship everything from the post office (which is alright, since it's right up the street).  I'm about a two months away from being a powerseller.  I'm liking this.

       Stress.  And more stress.  That's all there is.  I have the stress of finals approaching, the stress of living with my dad.  The stress of dealing with one client's server move and another client's web site development project.  The stress of completing my homework, dealing with the usual student requests, and the stress of running my eBay business.  The stress of ordering packages, and the stress of shipping overseas and the stress of keep acurate business records.  The stress of maintaing the access point, and worrying about it's uncertian future.  It's just too much, it's far, far too much for me to handle.  But I can't stop.  I wish I could quit computer consulting, but there is no way that any of my clients could get along without me.  What would happen to the client who is in the middle of a website development project (and I have all the passwords, layouts, and files), what would happen to the woman that can't afford to hire an $80/hour consultant every other day when her kids break the computer?  I can't stand the work, and I'm so backloged, and it's serverly cutting into my life, but there is nothing I can do.  Everyone has a schedule they need stuff done on and I have my own school schedule and both just can't meet.  Besides, why am I earning money if my dad won't even consider allowing me to buy a car?  I can make the supplemental income that I need to get with my eBay business.  Unfortunately, I am people's only lifeline into the technology world.  And it is me - the company is part of me.  When people ask me to write a sentence about myself it always is: I'm Ross Nizlek, I'm a Junior in high school and I've run my own company since the age of twelve.  Not "I'm Ross Nizlek and I'm interested in politics" or "I'm Ross Nizlek and I'm training to be an EMT" or "I'm Ross Nizlek and I'm an enviromentally-inclined Junior in high school who has an interest in technology."  It's "I'm Ross Nizlek and I've run a company since the age I was twelve."  There is nothing I can do to make it go away, and I'm not sure I want to.  But I hate the work.  Every time you go somewhere, it's because someone is having a problem.  And all you deal with is problem after problem after problem.  No one ever has any good news, it's always something that is going wrong.    The only solution I can see in the short term is to subcontract the work.  So, anyone interested in earning $15-30 an hour?  Must have extensive knowledge of Macromedia Dreamweaver, Adobe Illustrator, and know how to use FTP, CPanel, Plesk, and understand basic HTML.  Should be able to work quickly and be able to start immediately.

       It is interesting, ever since the State of the Union address, I have been thinking about that girl that I met in Washington (who was from Greenwich), which is somewhat strange.  After the disasterous failure that the trip ended in socially, I resolved that I wouldn't ever get involved with liking a girl again, at least unless I had clear indications that she liked me.  But Washington had given me a taste of something I never had dreamed possible - a highly attractive girl that shared my primary interests.  And it couldn't have happened in a nicer place - our nation's capitol.  Just thinking about sitting with her talking about the State Department (which she wanted to eventually be part of), or eating lunch with her in the Capitol Building, or walking with her at the White House.  It was a dream come true.  But then there's the end - the last sleepless night when I tried to figure out what I when my closing moves would be in Washington.  The bus ride home, waiting for the bus to stop, and when it did, I walked by her and she never said bye to me.  And then when I went online two weeks later and tried to talk to her, she blocked me.  Sure, you could tell me to move on, but I can't, because I've had exposure.  I've met people who are like me, and then I am forced to return to a place where there aren't anyone like them.  Even if I wanted to meet some new girls, I couldn't.  There is no one - no one who shares my interests in politics.  And after meeting her, no one seems to compare.  Not to say that I'm obsessed with her - there are many others like her, I'm sure.  But they aren't here, they aren't in the desolate wilderness that is Easton and Redding.  Sure, after the trip I tried to pitch my "let's move to Greenwich" campaign, and then, out of desperation, "let's move anywhere but Easton," but of course they both failed.  I even tried to negotiate living with my grandmother and taking care of her (she lives in Greenwich) but that failed also.  So I gave up, and I took up campaigning for student interests.  But then I found that the students at Barlow didn't want to get involved in any movement that tried to increase their freedoms.  So I got back into poltics, taking up the Clark for President political campaign, and now that primary season is upon us, it's a rather exciting thing to be involved in.  It's momements of enjoyment, excitment, crisis, and disapointment, interspered with orders from my dad to "Turn off the heat in the family room!" or "Put on the heat in the Hallway!"  And then came the State of the Union, and after I had addressed the clients that were calling but before the President began speaking, I saw that the girl from Washington was online, and had an away message on: "Making popcorn then settling down to an enlightening speech from our "Talented and Gifted" Leader........$10 for 33 minutes."  And I wished I could be there next to her, pointing out all the lies of our commander in chief, or sarcastically complimenting him after reading a long list of foreign nations off without screwing one of them up, or making fun of him for not being about to pronounce words like "nuclear."  Every other guy takes his girlfriend to the movies, and all I want is to watch the State of the Union with her.  And even though I'm doing the same thing on the Clark IRC sever it just isn't the same, as a piece of plastic and silicon and PCB isn't the same thing as a person.  Everyone says that it will be different in college, and it probably will but why should I have to wait that long?     :-)

       As of recent, my life has been consumed with politics - and getting away from my dad.  (At least the former is working out much better than the latter).  First off, the State of the Union: there was a word missing - enviroment.  Bush totally skipped the Enviroment - but seemingly had time to talk about drugs in major league baseball (which may be an important sports issue but isn't something that needs to be addressed in the State of the Union).  Granted, this is probably because he has nothing to report ("In this year we have made great strides in protecting our nations resources - I have allowed drilling of the last untouched nature preserve in the United States, encouraged clear-cut logging of out nation's national forests, and increasing the pollution output of our nations dirtiest industries"), but he probably could find some additional lies to throw in just to bring the topic up (such as last year's hydrogen car).  His influence by the religious right is more than disturbing, and his total disregard for the seperation of church and state is nothing short of apalling.  And I couldn't believe that he started the whole thing off with declaring how the PATRIOT Act keeps us safe.  As for my personal life, if I had my way I'd just pack up and leave this house.  Every additional second I spend around my dad seems to be worse and worse (except when he is in a good mood, which only occurs when he makes fun of people, in tonight's case Bush), and my recent attempt of securing the car for two weeks so I can go to Fairfield to study everyday for finals (or, put more appropriately, get away from him) failed when he told my mom "It's 25 miles back and forth to Fairfield.  That's can't be allowed.  If he wants to study, he can study in his room!"  If I can't leave the house to study I won't do well on my finals, and he won't let me get an Insight, then I'll continue to do poorly because I'll be around him, and I won't get into any college that I want to go to - simply because I live with a huge asshole.

       "Give me financing on an Insight and I'll give you honor roll."  That's my offer to my parents.  They'll never take it but it's the only way they can win, and the only way I can possibly improve my falling grades.  If I had the money, I'd get one myself, but I need financing, because I'll never be able to get one by myself (and since I'm not 18 yet I can't apply for the financing myself).  Why an Insight?  Because the only way I'll ever be able to do well is to be 95% free, able to go anywhere and do anything without restrictions.  I would practically live out of the car, and show up at night to go to sleep (since I'd kill the gas miliage sleeping in it all night with the heat on), and occasionally for dinner.  I would do all my business and my academics with my laptop, my wi-fi card, and my cell phone.  I won't have to listen to my Dad's constant babling to the cat, my dad's orders or be a subject of his dictatorship.  I can avoid the household fights and disagreements, and my dad's general negitivity.  The sad thing is that there is no way for me to happily coexist with my father and get good grades at the same time.  He's a nice guy, and we always get along whenever we go anywhere or spend time with each other, but he's just not someone that you can really live with all the time.  I want to pull up my grades, I really do, and I'm very frustrated with the fact that I may not get into a college I want simply because of someone I have to live with.  But he will not even listen to me when I try and tell him that it's not the fact that I'm taking AP classes that is the problem, it's him.  He refuses to believe that he could possibly be the cause of any negitive emotions in our household.  At times the guy can just be so horribly wrong.  For example, I recieve a tremendous number of calls from clients on a daily basis.  I selectively pick and choose which I take based on: 1) The rate plan of the client, 2) The type of work I expect them to be calling about, 3) What I'm doing at the moment, 4) The probability of the client to ask for telephone support immediately, and 5) How much buisiness I do with the client on a yearly basis (more frequent clients get priorities because I want to keep their business, especially if they are on the $40/hr rate plan).  Now, the perfect tool for doing this would be caller ID, but my dad won't allow it (even though I offered to pay for it), saying "We'll (him and my mom) will screen your calls."  Alright, fair enough.  But today a client calls and I am evidently studying AP US History.  He hands the phone to me, and I ask, "who is it?"  He says, "a girl."  No shit sherlock.  Maybe call screening might involve asking their name?  Ends up while the person was a good client, they took an uneeded amount of my studying time up with a telephone support call.  And this happens all the time.  But I still can't caller ID.  My dad's reply to all this is that I don't need the name, if I am studying I shouldn't accept any calls and he'll have them all denied for me.  Which is rediculously and unessecarily rigid when many times I recieve calls from student who need to be faxed a homework assignment, which takes about a minnute to do.  But that's my dad - rigid.  And I'm a very flexible and dynamic person.  I'd form a metaphor of this involving DHCP routing and static ips, but only the CISCO people would understand that, and a precious few of them at that.  Anyway, I just need an Insight.

       For the second day in a row, I'm sitting downstairs waiting for the FedEx Ground guy.  He probably won't be here for a while.  But if I'm expecting a package when my dad is home, as I am now and every day this week, I have to wait downstairs for hours until the guy comes.  You see, when anyone shows up to our house, especially a delivery person, chaos erupts.  First the dog barks loudly and continues barking until whoever is there leaves.  Then my dad will drop what he is doing and will start yelling over the dog, "Will someone find out why the dog is barking!?!?"  Or if no one is there he will check in the window, and when he sees a delivery truck he'll start yelling at the top of his lungs, over the still barking dog, "ROSS!!!!  ROSS!!!  SOMEONE IS HERE FOR YOU, SOMEONE IS HERE FOR YOU!"  The logical person would yell, "Ross, FedEx is here!" so I can decide whether or not I want to go out and get the package, or let the guy leave it and get it later.  He'll never say who is there for me, be it a friend or FedEx or the FBI (I'm kidding - but he probably would do the same thing if the FBI showed up).   Also, with my dad you MUST go out and get the package, you can't just get it later.  So, I will run down stairs (because my dad will keep screaming until I do), and then I will run and put on my shoes and my jacket, and I will pass the barking dog, and run into the garage, have to open the door, and then finally get outside, where I will greet the FedEx guy and get my package.  If I sit downstairs, my dad won't scream, I'll get outside faster so the dog will shut up faster, and I'll avoid my dad going out after 20 seconds of screaming to get them himself, because he thinks that if I am not down the stairs in 20 seconds or less then I'm not comming.  Oh, to only live on my own...

       Today (well yesterday by the time I posted this), I was picked up on my way to school by a good friend of mine.  As we traveled down Barlow Drive (as the driveway of the school is known), my friend uttered something along the lines of, "These speedbumps, they should get rid of them.  If students want to violate the law by going fast, they should just die."  He brings up and interesting point.  Should students who engage in reckless behavior be allowed to bear the full weight of their risks, or should the school (or any other organization for that matter) soften the blow of those decisions by trying to prevent them?  Now, one most understand that my friend's comment had more to do with his anomosity towards Barlow students than anything else, and that I take a similiar view of such students, for a completely different reason.  I dislike Barlow students (that is the students in general, for I get along with all Barlow students and there are few, if any, I dislike as individuals) because they are apathetic creatures, unwilling to lift a hand to help pull themselves out of needless suffering.  There are an uncountable quanitity of things that could be done to make the school at minimum tolerable (including a later start time, which everyone seems to want and no one seems to have done anything about), but try to get the smallest movement started and they will not even comply.  Such was the case for all the projects I have begun and abandoned, including Wi-Fi for students and a "student representation committee" that would have some say in the school administration itself.  I myself am interested in making changes not only for the additional freedoms they will bring but also becaue such work is a matter of personal enjoyment, and would gladly work for a later start time (which is a very feasible goal, albeit one that requires an onerous load of research and background, as well as some politicing given there would need to be a referendum), but alas, the students wish not to even allow them to gain a few hours more of coveted sleep.  Granted some of the changes we implement will have little effect on us, being halfway through our junior year, but if everyone maintains that attitude nothing will ever get done because the freshmen and sophmores don't have enough experience to lead a major student movement and the juniors and seniors have decided to tough it out till they get to college.  Even worse is the student that declares that because we are granted certian freedoms at Barlow that other schools do not have, that we do not have the right to request change since the administration has been so generous in the freedoms that they have already laid out upon us.  In response to all this (with the students complaining all the while, nonetheless), I have developed my doctrine of  implied acceptance .  I believe that by walking into school every day but making not a single attempt to change the enviroment around you means that every student is perfectly happy with that enviroment and fully endorses everything the school does.  The only way to dissent to attempt to change.  Failure to do so automatically means that the student agrees with the school's policies.  In other words, the students have no right to complain about any administration policy or regulation unless they themselves have tried to or taken part in a movement to change that regulation, regardless of the sucess of that movement.

       Welcome to my new blog.  The old version, which I still have archived on the blogger servers but is no longer online for public viewing, was outdated, and, quite frankly, useless.  Given my abondonment of all social-related issues, I had nothing more about which I could coherently complain.  So, I'm starting off with a new idea - plain, completely random commentary of useless things.  Sound exciting?  I didn't think so.  But it just might be better than listening to me complain about how I had no social life.

       I just made some unbelivably good investments: a new wireless card and external antenna, and a color PDA.  I haven't opened the PDA yet, but I was experimenting with the wireless card, it was insane.  Imagine picking up your access point down the street from where you live.  I can stand about 4 acres away from my point and pick up a useable signal.  From my living room, I can get a perfectly clear signal from my neighbor's point - in fact, I can get it anywhere in my house.  I can't wait to go wardriving!  (But first, unpack the PDA!)

       I was browsing Bush's relection site this morning after reading about an ad on it attacking Kerry, and went to the enviroment section to see what he had to say.  There was only one thing there - a "healthy forests initative."  So I clicked it for more information, and I got the white screen that said "This Page Cannot be Displayed."  Kind of sums of Bush's enviromental policy, doesn't it?

       What I did today:  I turned on my laptop. I checked my e-mail. Upon not seeing a "Your Order Has Shipped" e-mail from Apple, I went to Apple.com I logged into my Apple Store account, in case they forgot to e-mail me Upon realizing that Apple has definately not shipped my order, I went to Macminnute.com I checked the forums Then I went to Macrumors.com And I checked the forums there, too. Then I went to Apple.com, and read about the G5, and Panther. Then I checked my e-mail.

       Now I'm trying to keep myself busy until the G5 ships, which I have determined should be by the end of the week (Apple said the latest possible ship date is next Monday).  I'm hoping it will ship Thursday so I have the weekend to play with it.  This is going to be the longest week of my life.

       The G5 order is "being processed" by Apple.  They sent me a second e-mail tonight to tell me.  How nice of them.  Since I'm going to be driving for remainder of the week and she usually doesn't ride the bus anyway, I've decided I'd just better talk to this girl in school.  If only I could find her sometime...I just never see her around.  With the G5 (almost) enroute and things going acceptably well socially, almost everything is looking up.  Except I have a sample AP Exam in English tomorrow, which I'd love to just skip, but I realize that the practice is invaluble.

       I like expensive solutions to simple problems:  Rather than spending a few hours reformatting my hard drive (Windows won't boot after I tried to mount my Linux partition last night), I'm spending $2,500 on a Dual 1.8 Ghz Apple G5 desktop.  I've decided that I just simply don't need a car: we have three cars, three drivers.  Sure, a hybrid would be cool, but so would a G5.  Also, if anyone is interested in the following computer, please feel free to make an offer:  AMD Athlon XP 2000+ 60 GB 7200 RPM HD GeForce 2 64MB 512 MB DDR PC2700 Watercooling Case Antec 480W Premium Power Supply (original cost $80) Shuttle Motherboard 10/100 Ethernet PCI Card LS-120 Superdisk Drive 6x4x32x CD-RW Windows 2000 Professional

       First: if you haven't watched the anti-SUV ad, do so now (my last post).  If you have an SUV, it may be your right, but go buy some renewable energy credits and do something good for once.  And now for the social news.  I am shocked at how prevelant a topic the prom is becoming.  Honestly, for me it would normally be a take it or leave it sort of thing, however, everyone else is interested.  And I thrive on competition.  A perfect example is the CISCO test I took yesterday.  There is a student in our class no one has ever beat in terms of test grades.  So last test, I said to him, "Next time I'm going to beat you."  I said it every class, and studied my ass off for the test.  I beat him by two points, (96 to 94).  I probably would have gotten an 85 if it hadn't been for the competition.  The same thing applies to the prom: If other people can take hot girls, why can't I?  Of course, if you were a frequent reader of my old blog, you'll remember I put this issue to rest much earlier this year, saying that this sort of stuff just wasn't worth the time, stress, and energy unless:  1) There was a person of sufficent value that it made such efforts worthwhile (with the definition of such a person being based upon Emily, the girl I met in Washington DC, who basically proved there was such thing as an attractive, politcally oriented high school girl). 2) Someone liked me, which would eliminate the stress of getting to know someone.  However, there might be a personal meeting exception # 2, with "might" being the opperative word.  However, as is always the case, I am faced with the same delimma: How do you get to know someone who you don't have any connection to?  We actually haven't ever exchanged a single word, except me saying "thanks."  Basically, I always sit in the front of the bus, given the fact that my bus ride is about 45 seconds after we get out of Barlow drive (which takes a while).  There is this attractive girl who sits in the front also, presumably because of the same reasons.  Once I was sitting there, and a book fell off my seat. Before I could reach down and get it she was handing it to me.  When she rides the bus (which is rarely) she stands up, blocking the asleway in the morning, letting me get out in front of her.  Once, she held a door for me on the way into school (though maybe she was holding it for the girl behind me, who knows?).  Another time she took a seat in the row across from me but never said anything (her choice of seats could be a coincidence, however).    Anyway, I don't know her name, she doesn't know mine (at least I don't think), and we have never talked.  Where do you go from there?  The other question is why would she like me?  To the extent I have had conversations with others on the bus I mostly have talked about either of my (at the time) two businesses - about dealing with annoying clients, standing in line at the post office, and mailing cameras overseas.  Not exactly stuff that makes you popular.  Maybe she wanted some of the $1,000/month I was making, but those days are gone.  Besides, if I was still making that kind of money I could easily afford a Prius, and who needs a hot chick when they can own a 2004 Prius?  The other thing is if she is just being nice I hate to misinterpret that and cause her to stop being nice, becoming another one of the many casualties that lie across the path of my past social ventures.  And how do I even get to know her?  And once I find out her name and start a conversation, which do I go from there?  It's so hard to deal with these situations when you don't know anyone who knows the person.  And what if she doesn't ride the bus again?  She only does it very infrequently.  Do I approach her in the hallway, and wouldn't that be rather awkward if we don't know each other?  I don't know how to go about answering the questions.  I wish I knew her name so I could find out her phone number, but then I'd probably never use it.  But there is a comfort in knowing who she is.  This is why I promised myself not to get involved in this shit.

       To give you an idea about my parents, I quote this actual conversation:  Mom: "Well, dad was thinking of going to Flordia on vacation." Me: "Wonderful!  I could actually have some time here by myself.  You him and Laura go.  Besides, I have to stay here to do my hours at Danbury Hospital." Mom: "Well, Dad was worried about that, so he decided not to go." Me: "Worried about what?" Mom: "Well, that you might do things we don't approve of when we are gone." Me: "Like what?  I don't go to parties, I don't do drugs, I'm not the type to go mailbox smashing, the only time I usually leave the place is to go to work and the post office." Mom: "Well, he was afraid that you might....that you might...[with horror in her voice]  drive on the highway ."  I think she should just be lucky that's the only thing she's worried about me doing if everyone went on vacation.

       My plans for the upcomming week: Take the SATs tomorrow, an two AP exams next week.  Lots of studying to do.  Otherwise not much has been going on.  I've been trying to pick up the pace academically, given my new chosen career.  I'm still trying to figure out how to introduce the idea to my dad, who is unaware of the sudden change.  I know he won't like it, as I would basically need to take four years of Premed before Med school.  And since I won't emerge from my undergraduate education with a degree that will immediately provide me with a career, he won't approve (I'd either have to do another two years or four years of graduate school for a PA or a MD, respectively).  I'm also having trouble explaining to other adults what I want to do.  Everyone belives that I should persue a technology career, given my aptitude for the area.  But the field of technology just doesn't have the same rewards as medicine.  That aside, I think the school and the school's administration had much to do with the change.  Sometime before I leave this school, I intend to compose a letter to the technology committee, letting them know they failed.  They may have an excellent program in place for those who need a basic technology education, but they fail to foster interest in the field at a higher level.  Sure, they offer the CISCO program, however those that enter the program frequently are profiled for investigation by school tech admins, and CCNA, while a very necessary certification, is heavily academic course.  Not that it is a bad thing, but to a certian extent, the school needs to allow students to put their interest to work in a useful setting.  Interested technology students see the school network admins as enemies, not mentors, and the admins see students as threats, not assets.  At the same time, I will complete my EMT certification through Barlow in June.  Next fall, thanks to my Barlow education, I will be put in situations where I can save someone else's life.  How can the school put me in a position where I hold a human life in my hands yet not let me touch the keyboard of the school's terminal server?  As part of the EMT curriculum, I  have  to spend time in a hospital emergency room, but as a Cisco student, a school admin won't utter a word about the network to me, even if I plead on my knees.  Sure, Mr. Mondi isn't the hot PA in the emergency room, but that has so little to do with the situation.  In the ER, I was trusted, I was given responsibilites.  In Barlow, I am subjected to a high-tempered network admin screaming at me during a class for something he later admitted was incorrect.  To him, I was the enemy, the knowledgable Cisco student, the epitome of all things evil.  To the PA, I was an EMT student, an indivdual who needed to be given the opportunities to practice the skills I had learned in a classroom setting.    It's no wonder I want to go into medicine.  Who do I want to end up working with - Mr. Mondi ("Flash drives!  NEVER AGAIN! NEVER AGAIN!"), Mr. Gerasoni ("I highly suggest you quit the terminal and get back to what you are supposed to be doing!"), or the PA ("Hey Ross!  Could you hook up an EKG in room 12?  Thanks a lot, I'll be right there!").  The school has to realize that the network admins, even if they are not teachers, are responsible for advancing learning, too.  After all, it's supposed to be their mission to  respect the diversity of student abilities and interests .  There are a number of reasons that there is such a difference between the EMT course and the technology department, starting with the administrators who oversee the programs, but ultimately the responsibility lies with every staff member within them.  The bottom line is, the technology department has failed.  They have taken a student destined for a computer career, a student who operates his own computer consulting business, who has lived and breathed computers for every year of his life since the fourth grade (during which their was, incidently, a voluntary program for students interested in technology to service the school's computers), and repelled him to the extent that he has chosen a completely unrelated field.  Nice job, Barlow tech committee.  Maybe you might reconsider your positions in the future.

       I'm starting to like the Emergency Room Doctor idea.  High pay (~$150,000/year) and med school is only four years, which is only another year in addition what I would have do for a law degree.  Besides, as an ER doctor, wouldn't a be a more attractive target for hot PAs?  Just kidding.  I wouldn't go into a field because of that.  I'm just not sure if I want to work in the IT industry all my life (and the school's network administrators don't exactly paint a positive picture of the job), as I may be good at computers, but it's just not a very exciting job, not to mention the fact that you are directly helping people as a doctor.   urlLink Physicians and Surgeons

       Potential career maps.  For some reason, the first and the last options seem most appropriate for seeking public office.  For the first, I question (again) if I really want to be working with computers all day.  And for the third, I question what I could do with both a medical major and a law degree.  I could investigate potentially going on to be an emergency room doctor, however I just don't know if I want to put myself through med school.  I'll have to look into it.  As for being a profesional paramedic (mentioned last post), I checked it out, and the pay is far too low, so I'm not considering it as an option.  AGE 18     Graduate from High School 22     Graduate from College with a degree in CIS, Minor in Political Science 22     Start work with a major corporation 23     Start law school, at nights 25     Graduate from law school 26     Open up private law practice, specializing in computer law 30     Seek state senate seat 34     Seek higher elected office (US House or Governor?)  OR  18     Graduate from High School 22     Graduate from College with a medical-related degree, Minor in Political Science 22     Start work in hospital emergency room 25     Become politically active locally 30     Seek state senate 34     Seek higher elected office (US House or Governor?)  OR  18     Graduate from High School 22     Graduate from College with a medical-related degree, Minor in Political Science 22     Start work in hospital emergency room 23     Start law school, at nights 25     Graduate from law school 25     Become politically active locally 30     Seek state senate 34     Seek higher elected office (US House or Governor?)  OR  Something else?  Frequent readers will also notice I made several improvements to the layout of the blog.  Small, things, but it should make it much easier to read.  I moved the comments option (which only one person seems to be using) under my name, and made is smaller, so it looks better.  I also added horizontal rules between posts, as before multiple posts from the same day would become all jumbled together.

       I recall the first day of EMT class.  We were all arranged in a semi-circle, Ben Gorbach to my left, Pat Owen to my right.  After a brief introduction, Ms. Goodpaster began calling on the students, asking them why they chose to take the course.  Around two thirds of the students had some interest into going a field of medicine in the future, but I was not amoung them.  While I planned to actively be a part of the EMS system throughout much of my life on a volunteer basis I had no interest in a medical career.  I wished to be an attorney with a specialty in computer/internet litigation, trying cases of a technical nature that would benefit from knowledgable legal counsel.  When Ms. Goodpaster promised the class that most of us who were not considering medical careers would be by the end of the course, I shrugged it off.  I knew what I wanted to do, and it was not working full time in medicine.  Earlier this week, I sat at a presentation at Marist College, with interest in pursing a degree in computer information systems.  I was taking CISCO, enjoying it, and the field was facinating.  Computer information systems was the major for me.  Then I went for my first hospital rotation for the EMT class.  I showed up early, as I had allowed extra time in case I had gotten lost on the way.  After sitting in my car for ten minutes (as I knew there was already an EMT student that was finishing up, and I didn't want to cause a scheduling conflict), I clutched my stethoscope and took the elevator down to ground level.  I was still a bit early, but that was better than late.  After halfway through the walk to the emergency room from the parking garage, I realized I hadn't locked my car.  Fearing for my radar detector, I ran back up and locked it.  After arriving in the emergency room waiting area and being directed to the nurses station by the nurse at the inital triage area, I was directed to Jim Cooper's office, where I picked up my swipe-card and blue coat, and as I exited I spotted Greg dealing with an infant.  The individual who had directed me to Jim's office went to find me a PA ( urlLink physican's assistant ) that I could begin my shift with.  I looked around at the PAs and noticed a really hot one.  As she walked by, the individual who had been leading me around called her over and introduced me as an EMT student who was begining my first rotation.  We exchanged our names, and then she (the PA) began giving me a tour around the emergency room.  After a while, she sent me off to get a set of vital signs from a paitent.  My first thought was not, "I'd better  do this right, I haven't had much practice,"  but rather, "I'd better do this right, I can't embarass myself in front of this girl."  My duties during the five hour rotation involved ferrying the EKG about, getting vital signs, and watching a few different procedures.  Several times, we transported paitents out of the ER to other floors of the hospital.  On one occasion, she introduced me to her also very attractive friend, who from what I understand also has some position in the emergency room.  There wasn't a tremendous amount of action during the day, but I left excited to return two days later (excited about having more time in the ER, not spending more time with her, that is).  By my second rotation (during which I was also paired up with her) there was far more action, and I got a better feel for the fast paced enviroment of the emergency room.  When I came home that second night, I thought about my career.  I liked CISCO, and I liked the emergency room.  However, there is something that every student in both CISCO classes has in common: they are all guys.  The emergency room was 75% female, excluding the doctors.  Which career did I really want?  How exciting is typing commands into a router all day?  Is that the life I initally wanted, assuming that I did not persue law school?  Either way, I want to hold some type of public office during my lifetime.  The desire to do so stems from my belief that one's purpose in life is to somehow positively influence the world around them, be it from a simple local action or an executive order from the desk of the President.  Elected office would allow me to work on a number of initatives, and besides, politics has always interested me.  So if one particular career would advance my chances of holding office, I would take it over other factors.  On one hand, there are the scores of politians with a law degree.  On the other hand, who could forget Dr. Dean, who led the polls  in the Democratic race for nomination until his abrupt defeat in the Iowa primaries?  Or Bill Frist, MD, the Senate Majority Leader?  It is almost expected that I go into the field of technology, given my aptitude for the area.  And external factors aside, I would probably enjoy both jobs equally.  But now I question if the IT industry is really the best choice, considering all factors.  In my mind there are two side by side images: on the left is a picture of the hot PA, and on the right, a laptop, connected through a serial connection to a router rack.  I think I'm going for the left.

       We are, no doubt, a society of conformists.  Each individual shelters within the comfort of the mass consensus, not questioning the true punishment for avoiding it.  We comply and strive for things we otherwise would not want, except that everyone else is involved.  We agree to things, take part in things, that we would normally never take part in, had we not simply followed our peers.  Whenever such thoughts come to mind, images of cell towers appear.  One of my most memorable experiences with this mob mentality came when a man appeared at our door, asking for my dad.  I let him in, as my dad was on the phone, as he seemed to know who he was.  In fact, he did not.  He was a representative from AT&T Wireless, and wanted to pay us $100,000 over the next 50 years for erecting a cell tower in our backyard.  My father kindly and politely sent him on his way.  I soon found out why.  A man who resided down the street from myself happily agreed to allow AT&T to construct the flagpole-like object in his yard.  The neighbors went insane.  They marched to his house, demanded that he stop, they held meetings, even the town selectman came to support their cause.  When the AT&T trucks arrived, the lady whom the unfortunate man shared a driveway with would not allow them in.  Neighbors from down the street, neighbors who would in no way be affected by the tower, who would not see it, organized a march to his house.  They attended the meetings; they voiced their opinions strongly - no cell tower was to be put in.  Ninety percent of these people were in no way affected by the tower, but once the obstinate lady down the street showed at their door and encouraged them to join, they were in.  My father sat out the fiasco in the comfort of his home.  We did not attend a meeting, and my father, as usual, believed that we should not allow ourselves to be entangled.  He resisted the mob mentality, most likely because three months earlier it had put me in one of the largest legal problems I was likely to face in my life.  I will not deny that there are a good number like my father who manage, somehow another, not to become one of the crowd, however while they do no harm, neither do they do good.  I, on the other hand, wished to attend the meetings.  I wished to voice my opinion, to tell them that I had no problem with a cell tower being placed down the street, that if it was my property, I'd just as well put it right in the middle of my backyard.  If they didn't like it, they could buy me a satellite phone so I would be able to make cellular calls without interference from the comfort of my home.  They only cost a few thousand dollars a year; surely that is enough to pay to avoid something that looks no different than a flagpole from being built next-door.  I'd even be kind enough to fly a flag on it, they'd never know the difference.  But I did not venture to the meetings, as I did not want to falsely represent my family's stance.  The cellular incident, which began two years ago, is still in litigation somewhere in the state, if I am correct.  However, that is not my point.  My point is that, without positive reason, we on a whole do not go against the grain of the society in which we live.  This is especially typical of high school, as given a number of individuals are in close proximity on a daily basis and inevitably their lives intertwine, so any action against the norm will be further discouraged by embarrassment in front of their peers.  Which brings me to the prom.  When the word itself is mentioned, the first thing that comes to mind is PROM.  Programable read only memory.  Now, the first thing people will exclaim after reading the previous line is that I am a "nerd," or another word of choice which caries a similar connotation or meaning (which again illustrates the pressure of conformism I mentioned above).  The fact of the matter is, I will probably spend more of the time during my life working with PROM than I will attending a high school  prom .  That aside, I do not want to attend the event.  I see absolutely no point in it (though I do see why many girls would want to go);  when I asked others why they wished to go, the only answer I received was that if you didn't go, you would look like a "loser."  I'd rather look like a "loser" than a conformist.  I will admit that sure, I'd like to spend May 30th or whatever date the event may be, with an attractive girl.  But I'd rather spend it at some place that doesn't require formal attire, that doesn't involve the renting of a limousine, that doesn't involve all the formalities associated with the event.  Why anyone would want to subject themselves to such torture doesn't seem apparent to me - except as a means of conforming to the expectations of student society.  So as others desperately seek girls as the time runs out, make arrangements for limos, buy tickets and sign waivers, I sit in front of my keyboard, writing the latest letter to the school administration or polishing my election speech.  Sure, I'm hoping that everything will work out with the girl on the bus, but I have no intentions of asking her to the prom, and would only resort to going if she held our relationship (assuming there will be one) hostage.  For those that sit out May 30th, feeling sorry or disappointed or rejected, I question why.  What does it matter if no one in your school system wishes to attend the event with you?  Does it matter if you know what you are doing is right?  But students will be students, they will not seek any higher purpose than temporary enjoyment and social conformism, and I have no business in changing their ways.  They will attend the prom on May 30th, while I work and sleep as I always do, sitting out the event that two years past I promised myself I would never miss, if for no reason else to prove that I was could have equal social standing, to prove that I, as I now realize, could be nothing more than a conformist.  How times have changed.

       I think I'd better stop contributing to Apple's quarterly gains, at least until I am no longer almost-broke.  I just bought an 15 GB iPod from Macconnection.com.  Overnight shipping with Saturday delivery was only $16 (an upgrade from ground at $9) and you can place orders anytime before 2 AM and they will be shipped same day.  So, I'm now counting down tomorrow.  I also paid for a car adaptor, and a Griffen iTrip (FM transmitter).  The whole package cost me $365, with shipping.  My dad would kill me if he knew I was spending this kind of money, but hey, I tried for four months to get him to talk about getting a car, and finally I got fed up, so I've been blowing away all my car money since.  I also reminded myself why I only shop online.  I went to the Trumbull Mall and they didn't have a single 15 GB iPod in stock.  Neither did a single store in the mall.  Although, I found an Insight in the parking lot and spent about five minutes admiring it.  First one I've seen up close, bringing the hybrid  count to 5, 3 of which I found parked (allowing me to get a better look at them).  Things are good.  Now I've just got to get to know this girl, and I'll be all set.

       My best ideas always come to me at night.   I know how I'm going to get to know her.   I've answered the impossible question of how do you get to know someone you have no connection with, at least for now.  Spent most afternoon at the Fairfield Police Department shooting with the Easton Explorers, and am now slaving away at CISCO.  Tomorrow, I have a meeting with a Barlow administrator to clear up a false accusation by the technology department.  I'm glad this is happening to me, as I know how to vigorously exercise my student rights, as opposed to someone who'd just let the accusation stick.  That tech admin needs to be taught what proper conduct is, and that he should do some questioning before making his accusations.

       That girl on the bus, whom I'm sure recieved at least a brief mention on this page, is no longer under consideration.  Not as a result of anything happening, but more as a result of nothing happening.  So, rather than worrying about her for another few months while nothing happens, I'm just forgetting about the whole thing.  Besides, didn't I promise myself I wouldn't get involved with girls after Washington?  Well, at least not with the people here.  Anyway, I spent most of my time since I got home today working, and netted a nice income - $140 before taxes (which includes 1.5 hours of work I did this weekend).  I've got to get Quickbooks loaded on my laptop soon.

       I love paperless technology.  Which is why when Apple was kind enough to offer me a year's subscription to MacWorld, I opted for the electronic version of the magazine.  Rather than waiting weeks for the next issue and having stacks of magazines strewn around my room, they are all neatly organized on my computer and delivered instantly.  Plus, not only are the magazines completely identical to the paper copies, but they act like magazines: the paper actually flips when you turn and page.  Also, when I notice an interesting link, I only have to click it and it opens in my web browser.  Not to mention it's saving trees.  I also bought a copy of the latest MIT Technology magazine (who's name evades me), as they had a feature on hybrid technology.  Most popular magazines are availible through the services, and it works on both Macs and PCs.  Take a look at it on  urlLink Zinio.com .  Also, I recieved a 5 on my writing portfolio, which was a nice touch to the day.   RULES FOR IM:  -Full sentences!  Actually, coherent sentences.  Don't leave entire words out, it makes things hard to read.  -Spell out words!  "I'm going 2 the store" is just iritating.  -Type everything on one line.  Don't write a sentence halfway through, and then send the other half.  Just finish it the first time.  -Abbreviations are fine, just make sure they are standard  -Express full concepts coherently!  Don't say, "PCs = Bad?" say "You don't like PCs, right?"  -If you don't understand something, say "I don't understand" or "what?"  "?" does not mean you don't understand.

       If you bash Macs, I would suggest you try one first.  I don't mean the $700 eMacs that the school has.  I mean something like my new dual processor 1.8 Ghz G5 that has a newer OS installed than the eMacs, anyway.  The graphics are perfect, the games play well (superbly if they take advantage of a MP system), it is unbelivablely stable.  Startup time from power on is less than 20 seconds.  Find me a PC that will beat that.  I understand if you don't like them because they are increadibly expensive (but most good things are), or because you're a gamer, and games are simply more accessible on a PC.  But if you don't fall into one of these two categories, then you should seriously consider a Mac.  For those who would even like to consider themselves hackers, Mac bashing is simply off limits.  Mac OS X is based on Unix - it practically is Unix.  You can run most Unix apps from your Mac with only a little configuration.  And if you are trying to hack using Winblow$, as it is sometimes known, you shouldn't even call yourself a hacker.  Not that I'm putting myself in that category, as I still have a lot to learn.  For those who don't believe they are smart enough to learn a new operating system, it isn't that hard.  And if you aren't going to at least make an attempt to understand MacOS X, you shouldn't be bashing it.  If you're simply too stupid to learn a second operating system (which I find hard to believe), then that's not Apple's fault, so don't blame them for it.  If you don't like the one-button style mouse, then just buy a two button.  I got one that matches my Apple keyboard for $6 on eBay - brand new.  Plus it has a touch-scroll sensor, kind of like the navigation device on an iPod.  And if, for whatever reason, you prefer to work with Windows, thats fine too.  But that doesn't mean that Macs are bad.  In fact, I can't think of one good reason a Mac-basher has given me why Macs suck.  Sure, Mac OS 9 is a horrible operating system, I think we can all agree on that, but Mac OS 10.3 is above and beyond what any Windows system has to offer.  (Yes, I got my G5)

       Correction: The G5 has shipped, and FedEx picked it up  today .  I don't know how or why, since FedEx almost never does Saturday pickups, and when they do, it's for Priority Overnight and above services (the G5 is coming Standard Overnight).  However, the pickup is just another bullet on the long list of why FedEx is the best shipping carrier out there.  Go FedEx!  (and go Apple, for paying employees to build my computer on a Saturday).  So it's comming Monday.  Nice.

       The G5 has shipped (well, FedEx will pick it up Monday).  If you are interested (and for my personal reference so I can track it at school), the tracking number is 615175186443 via FedEx Standard Overnight.  Track it on FedEx.com (it won't be in the system till Monday).  I'm excited.  Also, FedEx is the first delivery company to have plans to deploy a fleet of hybrid delivery trucks:  urlLink http://www.environmentaldefense.org/go/fedex/

       G5 or Social Opportunity?  Which should I be spending my time worrying about?  Even if I forget about the G5, FedEx will soon be pulling in the driveway - no matter how many times I check my order status, it's not going to get here any faster.  However, if I put aside the G5 for a moment, I really can't do anything with social opportunity.  I don't see the girl on my bus ever (except on the bus, and that's only once a week).  And so, next time I see her, I will talk with her, or make my best attempt.  And then, in time, things will fall apart, and it will be another failure to add to my social logbooks.  Or will it?  I don't really care, since it's not she is anyone special.  And then there is prom.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't understand why everyone wants to go.  As far I can see it, it means sacrificing a lot of time so I can dress in uncomfortable garments and rent a big, gas-guzzling, air-polluting, traffic-obstructing vehicle with some people I know to drive to some hotel in Norwalk or Stamford or somewhere like that.  And sure, it would be with some hot girl.  But really, what's the point?  If you're going because of the hot girl, wouldn't it be more convient to sit at home in a nice comfortable chair and talk with them on the phone?  Or better yet, go out and do something that doesn't involve traffic-obstructing vehicles and formal attire?  And if your hoping that inviting someone to the event will improve the relationship so you can stay together afterwards, I guess it's a valid attempt, but I think if I got anyone to go with me they would have been willing to go out with me in the first place, so going won't do much to promote the relationship.  Or is that faulty reasoning?  Because I can't see this girl on my bus saying "yes" to go to the prom and then not returning my calls the next week.  Either we would have a relationship or we would not.  Maybe I'm not making any sense.  Or maybe people just like that sort of stuff.  I don't know.  Maybe someone could explain it to me.

       I missed a chance to go see  The Day After Tomorrow  since I didn't want to set off my dad, who has been a ticking time bomb this weekend.  He's already exploded at least three times and took it upon himself to destory my entire Sunday.  Today, he tried to prevent me from using the car to go to the Memorial Day Parade (I had signed up to work with the police explorers).  So, I figured it was probably in my best interest  not  to go out again, seeing that I had been out since 8:30 in the morning (though I was working - the parade then two computer jobs.  But my dad doesn't draw a distinction - if I'm not working for him, then it's not work.  I might as well have been at the movies all day.  And, this weekend, he would give me precise times he wanted things done (I want the lawn mowed in five minutes!), and if they weren't done excatly then, he would explode again and do them himself, not allowing to anyone to help).  Anyway, I see some pretty interesting developments with regard to the situation at home in the near future.  However, another interesting idea came up: Maybe, just maybe, if I move quick enough, I could take Cara to the movies (that's right, she has a name now, for you hapless people that can't decode binary).  Imagine, me taking a girl to the movies - a pro-enviromental movie, of all things.  Of course, I wouldn't limit my options to that choice, as it might not be particularly desireable to her.  But the sheer idea of it is interesting.  The only way to get such an idea to work is if I spent everyday at her table in commons, which even if I could bring myself to do it, I'm not quite sure whether or not it would be an advisable thing.  I could always push it back to the week after, but regardless, I have to act fast, as the school year is rapidly coming to a close.  Anything beyond the 12th-13th is out since the next Friday is the day before my EMT practical and also the begining of finals.  The general idea is to sit at her table on and off for a few days, then get her screen name, then talk to her online over the weekend, then panic for the remainder of the next week as I try and work out the logistics of doing something with her or her friends.  Anyway, since I've talked to several people who have found the Day After Tomorrow to be an enviromentally motivating movie, I've got a short list of things you can do:  -Buy CFLs (Compact Flourescent Lightbulbs) - these can have a tremendous impact as they use a quarter of the energy of a standard lightbulb, and lights are one of the greatest consumers of power.  -Shut off your computer at night.  -Buy 100% recycled paper (you can get it at Staples, or ask me, I always have plenty)  -Shut off your lights when you aren't using them!  Too many people just leave all their lights on all night, even when they aren't around.  Horrible waster of energy.  -Recycle paper.  Newspaper doesn't count!  I mean actual paper, like anything that comes in the mail, or printer paper.  That sort of stuff.  Then give it to me, or take it yourself to the Trumbull Transfer Station (I have directions, it's not that hard to get there, it's on the Monroe town line).  -Recycle cardboard.  Same thing as above, except applies to corrugated cardboard.  Ask me for more details.  And if you live in Redding, replace "Trumbull Transfer Station" with "Redding Recycling Center."  You have less of an excuse not to recycle, because you actually have a transfer station in your own town!

       It's 12 in the morning, but since I don't plan on going to bed until one, I'm going to compile a partial list of things that really piss me off (in no particular order):  1.  VERBALIZE THINGS!  Don't use things like "etc" in instant messages or use really strange non-standard abbreviations that I won't ever be able to figuure out and be specific.  I have no paitence for when people aren't clear because they are trying to get across an idea as fast as possible or they are simply lazy and don't want to type out all the words in an IM.  Another irritating thing people do that falls into this catagory is make strange sounds to indicate something, rather than verbalize it.  I'd give some examples, but different people say different things, and I'm not about the single anyone out here.  Also, some people will use those IM smilies in place of text.  The smilies are meant to supplement text, or give it a particular meaning, but not in replace of it.  Improper use of smilies: ":-("  in place of "I am really upset about that" or something similar.  Proper use of smilies: "My cat died today.  :-("  In the second example, the smile is properly used to supplement the text, not in replace of it.  2. Don't leave me short messages!  Some people call my voicemail and leave me really short messages that are the same every time.  For example, "This is Bob, call me back.  Bye."  If you are calling me, it's because you have something to talk about.  Tell me what it is!  If you don't leave me a real message, I likely won't return your call since I will interpret this you having nothing productive to talk about.  Instead, say things like, "Hi, this is Bob.  I had a quick computer question for you, call me back when you can."  Not too much additional effort, but I get a good deal about why you called.  3.  Don't cut me off in mid-sentence!  If I'm discussing something with someone, don't interupt me.  Wait till I finish my sentence.  Obviously, if you are the one I'm talking to, you can cut me off at any time.  But if you have just walk up to me when I'm having a conversation with someone else, at least the common courtesy to let me finish my sentence.  4.  Don't make an argument and then avoid supporting it!  People will sometimes say things like "Well, I think you're wrong about that."  When I ask them why they think they are wrong, they just say, "I don't want to discuss it right now."  Well, if you didn't want to discuss it, why did you bring it up in the first place?   As I said, this is a partial list...but I really don't feel like typing out any more.  Good night.  Or, maybe more appropriately, Good morning.

       I'm trying to think if there is a political faction I hate more than the religious right.  Sure, it's fine to be pious and all, but who gives them the right to lobby to restrict everyone else's rights?  Sure, you may not want your kids to watch certain things on TV - enable V-Chip.  Or you may personally have something against gays, and you may not allow them to marry at your church - but that doens't mean you should try and stop them from being married.  These people have to understand that it's fine if they don't find certain things acceptable - but they can't begin to control the lives of everyone else.  That's the definiton of a secular state.  Anyway, I came across a piece in the Times that just illustrates the stupidity and backwardness of our government:   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/arts/30RICH.html

       Thinking about 01000011011000010111001001100001 (if you know how to read this, then I can probably trust you with her name).  I know I said this last week, but when we get back to school on Tuesday, I'm going to do something.  I have to, I just can't wait any longer.  Tuesday (or Wednesday if I can't find her on Tuesday) will be the day I get to know her.  On the positive side, a lot of progress has been made in the last week.  I: -Secured the help of my sister who provided valuable background information on her -Found a good time I can greet her in the hallways -Found out we share free periods -Found an alternative solution to talking on the bus  Now I've just got to put all this to work and actually sit down and talk with her!  That's the hard part, but I just have to force myself to do it.

       Who wants $150?  I'm serious.  I've gotten fed up with the attitudes about responsible use of resources.  So I am offering a contest to my readers (at JBHS).  You win it, you get $150 cash.  For the next six months, you need to make your households as enviromentally sound as possible.  At the end of six months, I'll take a look at everyone who has participated and determine which person did the best job.  Let me know before you begin so I can track your progress.  Here are some ideas: -Recycle paper (actual paper, not newsprint!  ask me how) -Turn off your lights -Replace incandescant lightbulbs with CFLs (ask me how) -Buy renewable energy (ask me how) -Turn off your A/C when you aren't home -Shut down your computer when you are asleep -Don't leave your TVs running -Drive less, or don't drive something horribly polluting (i.e. SUVs, etc.) -Use 100% recycled paper.  The list goes on and on and on.  You think of something yourself.  And I'm dead serious - I'm giving away $150 of my hard earned money to try and teach you people something.  Make sure to save your reciepts, and I'll need copies of your electric bills for the months of the contest, one month before, and one month after (I can make the copies for you).  Save things to prove you did what you did (CFL boxes, reciepts for recycled paper, etc).  Write up what you did and what you will continue to do, and you'll get the $150 if you were the most envriomentally sound participant.  Tell your friends, it's open to all.  I reserve the right to cancel the contest at any time if there are less than 5 participants.

       First, before I forget, bookmark this blog!  If you are currently using a link in my profile to access this site, it will soon be removed.  Given the nature of some of the stuff I've written on here, the link in my profile and any reference to my blog will be removed as soon as I begin having online conversations with the girl on my bus.  If things work out, I may even have to delete specific entries, but I'll deal with that when and if I'm there.  I'm proabably the only student in the nation who is disapointed that we don't have school on Monday.  The holiday shot away the only opportunity I have next week to talk to the girl on the bus.  Sure, I can greet her in the hallways, but the bus is emerging as the only viable time to actually have a conversation.  She does share one of my free periods.  I never realized this since I spent all my time in the media center this year and aparently she never goes there.  One might think this is a great thing, however it is of relatively little significance: if she stays in the WRR, there is no talking, so there is no possible way to have a conversation with her.  If she stays in commons, more than likely she sits with her friends (or why would she be there?) and as a total stranger I just can't sit down at a table with her and her friends.  I need to find a better time to talk to her, other than Monday afternoons on the bus!  Apparently she also attends the Church that my mom is affiliated with through the nursery school she works at.  My mom, of course, belives this to be a wonderful opportunity to get to know her.  I'm a bit more hestitant.  First of all, I am by no means a religious person, so attending Church regularly is almost an alien idea to me, especially for an attractive girl of all things.  Things were much simpler with Emily (from Washington DC) who was not a church-goer by any means, and we shared similar views about the role of religion in one's life (though I shared most of my opinons with her).  Anyway, I've yet to decide whether or not I want to get involved in this "opportunity."  I think if I can logistically pull it off, this situation might work.  I walk down the hallways, seeing guys with their girlfriends, and ask myself, "Can this be me?"  I can't see it.  But then again, I couldn't see myself being booked in the Easton Police Department, either.

       "These are the times that you will remember for the rest of your life."  That's what they said at the class council presentation, back during the election.  It was a reference to (next years) prom and senior class trip.  I thought to myself how wrong it was, that I would not would be one who would look back on that time and say I enjoyed it.  I thought about my dad.  It was the summer after 3/7 and my social affairs had become family business, especially after my father paid an attorney $45,000 to bail me out of their horrible aftermath.  My dad and I were in the living room, he was sitting on the couch and I was pacing back and forth.  He was advising me that getting involved with popular girls in high school was not a good idea, but the underlying message was clear: any relationship greater than a friendship with any girl in high school should not be considered.  "You know," he told me, "I had a very tough time in high school.  I didn't attend my high school prom."  I thought to myself, in the ignorance of the moment, that I would not be like him.  That I would rise above him, that I would look back on my high school social life and say it was a miserable failure, that I would attend prom my senior year.  But two years later, things are different.  As a habit, I routinely read the blogs of several other students.  Today, one had an extensive entry, and I came across  urlLink this picture .  I looked at it, and I know that I'm not going to prom next year, girlfriend or not.  Prom is about having one memorable night with friends.  That's not memorable for me.  In the end, I'm not like my father.  I run a sucessful business and that business is my life.  When I make phone calls, it's not to a girlfriend but to my clients, when I go places on a friday night, it's to a job, not to hang out with my friends.  I wouldn't want it to be any different.  I am excited, having established a credit card with a $10,000 line of credit, so I don't have to use my own money to pay for client purchases before I'm reimbursed.  I am busy, not because of my social schedule or the activites I choose to partake in, but because recently there are a number of clients that need computer support.  Some people will run into their girlfriend while running errands, I run into my FedEx Ground delivery guy.  This is the life I love.  I know I couldn't be standing in that picture.  Many of my friends are, but it's just not my life, it's not who I am.  The girl on the bus is outside all of this, as is everyone else I have always liked.  She is not part of my group of friends, she is not friends with my friends, they do not know her, she does not know them.  If I went to prom senior year (and that being only under duress, as I tend not to like extreemely formal social outings) a decision would have to be made as to whether I would sit at a table with her friends, or she would sit with mine.  There are no connections, those are not the type of social ties I have.  But I love the life I live, I wouldn't give anything to change it.  My VoIP line, my TiVo, my credit card, my bank accounts, my G5, my business, my social life, my family.  Everything I own I paid for with my own time and money, and I manage to have enough freedom to manage my own finances without supervision, to not have my parents looking over my shoulder when I buy things.  I guess I just was never meant for high school.

       Today was a very good day.  Alough timing and circumstances beyond my control did not permit me to talk to the girl on my bus, I found out that in middle school she wasn't very popular, which is an excellent thing, considering she is very nice and an attractive person.

       Help!  It's almost Monday and I haven't figured out how to distract an annoying freshman with an insanely short attention span.  Sure, I can be ready to talk to this girl, but if he gets in the way...  Something needs to be done, and I haven't a clue as to what to do.  Readers, any ideas?

       I've made my mind up: Monday I'm going to get to know this girl on my bus.  She was on today, and though we only exchanged a few words I have a tremendous amount of hope for the situation.  I'd like to get her screen name, since I don't know if I could bring myself to call her on the phone, and then work from there, becoming friends with her first, and see where that takes me.  That's all I'd want in the short term anyway.  The problem is, given the situation and the circumstances, there really is no room for friendship.  If ask for her screen name, for her phone number, that obviously implicates that I like her.  Now, as a friend of mine pointed out, that's not necessarily a bad thing at all.  If she is interested in me, then it will allow things to progress smoother.  However, I always operate under the assumption that the other individual has absolutely no interest in me and that if I asked them out at any given time, they would turn me down.  Call it overly pessimistic, but it avoids a tremendous amount of disapointment.  All this aside, I've got to figure out what I'm doing.  I have no experience in this sort of thing, so I have no idea whether it would be better to get her screen name or her phone number, what to talk about, what to say, whether or not to initally use her name (I only know it because she signed my election paperwork, and would using it have an almost 'stalker'  implication?).  And if I ever had to call her on the phone...well, I have absolutely no idea what to say.  The people who advice "just play along with it and see how it goes" are useless, since that implies I know where to start.  How do start conversations with people you don't really know?  The other complicating factor is this other freshman on the bus.  He pesters me with questions from the start of the ride to the finish, and had it not been for him, I would have very well taken up a conversation with the girl today.  But he questioned me about renewable energy from the begining of the ride to the time I disembarked: every time I would turn toward her, he would spout another question about windmills or hydroelectric dams, or why we can't use solar panels.  That's partally my fault, since I was the one who initally lectured him on the topic many months ago, as he was one of those not well liked kids on the bus who sat by himself, so I talked with him to be nice.  Someone suggested to give him something to read, but he's one of those speds with a horribly short attention span and I'd be suprised if he could read anything I could find lying around my room anyway.  I need to find a way to distract him.  And I can't have him jump into the conversation between the girl and I, it would be a highly embarasing situation, since he comes across exactly like he is: just plain dumb.  The other option is to talk with the girl in school, but since I rarely pass her in the hallway I don't consider that a viable alternative.  So many problems...hopefully I will have them resolved by the weekend.  But I have hope.

       While I am on my rampage of pro-Mac propaganda, I'll mention that I just read the following on another Barlow student's blog:   Fuck!  I just lost my longest entry ever. From 12 to 2 AM I wrote my awesome story. I even saved it. But my fucking computer really conspired against me by:  A. Contracting a virus that McAfee, since I never paid $40 to reregister, managed to miss. (I got the reregistration notice this afternoon. I got the virus just now. Coincidence? Corrupt business I tell you.)  B. Failing to post my LiveJournal entry. However, I had copy/pasted to Word. Yet, the computer truly hated me since it  C. neglected to save my document. Even though I pressed SAVE multiple times, it didn't click. It just froze. The end.    Three words: buy a Mac.  No worries about virii, and a Mac with an appropriate amount of RAM running 10.3.3 won't ever crash.  Too bad, the student might have been able to keep his entry.

       There has been an anti-Mac video circulating at school, and I finally got my hands on a copy of it.  I watched it, on my Mac of all things, and I must say, it was good for a laugh.  Shortly thereafter, I needed to print some postage, on Stamps.com, a PC based application.  I pulled out my Dell laptop running Windows XP, and booted it up.  Lo and behold, a blue screen error!  I restarted it, and choose to boot normally, rather than resort to safe mode.  It crashed again.  And again, and again.  After six attempts, I gave up on booting normally, and went for safe mode.  Of course, Stamps.com didn't work in safe mode!  So, I restarted it, and by some miracle of God, it booted normally.  But then the cursor went crazy, as it usually does, flying to the corners of the screen and not allowing me to move it, except by way of an external mouse.  But I guess I can only blame that on Dell, not Microsoft.  After I finally dug up an external mouse, I was able to print my postage, without too much difficulty, and somehow managed to shut the thing down.  I reminded myself why I still owe Apple about $2,600.  Because despite the fact that their product may cost as much as a used car, it works.  It was hard to resist not beating the Dell to pieces with the solid metal case of the G5.  But it because apparent, after thinking about it for a while, that I just didn't want to scratch the G5's case.  But I understand why some people like Windows.  They enjoy having to scan weekly for spyware, to spend money on a virus scan and have to run it constantly, to constantly worry about infected files.  They love the thrill and adventure of reformatting their hard drive for the sixteenth time, and the joy that comes when a blue screen error flashes accross their screen.  For me, however, I just like the comforting simplicity of knowing that the next time I turn on my Mac, it will actually work.

       There are some times I wish this was a private document.  That I had the freedom to talk about the girl on my bus, to use her name, to beg the answer to the unanswerable question: how do you get to know someone you have no connection to, save that you ride the bus together once a week?  Sometimes I wish I could mention the girl that I find attractive in my own grade, to say that looks isn't everything and it's personality that really counts, to explain why I'm not really friends with a single female at my own school, to mention that I haven't talked to a girl online in more than six months.  But I have difficulty writing anything that the public won't eventually see: what is the point of writing something that no one knows exists?  If I want to have a discussion with myself, I can do it while I mow the lawn, I don't need to spend my time in front of my computer.  Not that I'm complaining.  After all, this is high school.  Rather than spend time talking on the phone with my girlfriend, I spend it at the CRRA's computer recycling day, mowing the lawn by hand in a desperate attempt to reduce it's enviromental impact, toying with one of the many electronic gadgets I've purchased in the past few years, or writing new content for this site.  And I enjoy life.  I wouldn't ever stack my life up against someone else's and compare what they have and I don't.  I'd never give away my enviromentalist tendencies, I'd never be caught driving in a giant SUV or not recycling mixed paper or corrugated cardboard.  Maybe for these things I give away something socially, but maybe it all stems from some poor choices I made freshmen year.  It's probably not worth debating.  But it doesn't prevent me from sometimes thinking that maybe, just somehow, there is a way to still be myself and find some social success.

       Some people look foward to the Prom.  I look foward to Electronics Recycling Day.  This being my first year in attendance, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was excited.  I left my house early to run across town and pick up some other electronics from someone who left them out for me.  After loading their massive TV set, several old computers, and assorted accessories into the car, I headed back to my place, where I spent ten minutes manuevering six high capacity UPS units into my trunk, then finished loading what I had to take.     I had to lower the split-folding rear seat to fit everything in..    A view from the driver's seat.    Sitting on the UPS units, relaxing.   I then took the car down and dropped my mom and sister off at Kohl's before heading over to FHS, where the event was being held.     I found it!    Waiting for my car to be unloaded.  All the electronics were sorted into the boxes on my right, then brought by forklift onto a number of trucks which were waiting for them.   It was great fun, and I can't wait to see the total collection figures from the day, which will be posted some time in June.

       Life, for the moment, is reltively uneventful.  My domain name is back online, Barlowspeaks is active, the CRRA's computer recycling event is this weekend, and things are looking up.  Sure, the prom is next week, one of those emotionally disheatening reminders of my social status, but I'll make the best of it.  There isn't anything I can do about that, so why bother to care - there are more important things to worry about in life, why get involved in such things.

       The most important thing right now is that you can see this.  The fact that my blog is displayed across your screen (or being continually redrawn across your screen if you have a CRT) means that I have secured my domain from my ex-hosting company.  Two weeks ago, they randomly changed my nameservers and not having registered the domain myself, I could not reset them.  It seems that immediately after changing my servers they went out of business, took an extended vaction or simply just stopped responding to my e-mails. After waiting about a week for a responsse, I gave up contacted the registrar. After much completing paperwork, copying my Sales and Use Tax Certificate (which serves as my business license) along with my driver's license and faxing everything to the registrar, they took the domain away from the hosting company and deposited it in my account, under my control (which is where it should have been the last four years).  Now, for the new layout.  If you like to new design, thank Blogger.  They entirely upgraded their interface last week.  Now, with the addition of comments (before I had to script in my own comments) I don't see why anyone would use LiveJournal.  Besides, LiveJournal is the service of choice amoung non-technical teenagers, a demographic I don't like to associate myself with.  Blogger offers basic and advanced features with 100% standards based HTML code and CSS sheets, that's easy enough for anyone to use but open enough for the advanced to tweak.  You'll notice the comments feature is different.  I removed the one I scripted in, and added the offical blogger comments feature, which has a much nicer interface.  Sorry, but all old comments are gone.  Before I forget, Saturday is Electronics Recycling Day at Fairfield HS.  Take all your old electronics (computers, TVs, stereos, etc) there between 9 and 1, or let me know and I will do it for you.  Thank the CRRA.   urlLink Barlowspeaks.org

       It appears there is much confusion over what I meant by "elimination of hall passes."  Hall passes, in their current use, have two purposes: to control student movement, and to act as a written excuse for a student arriving late to class.  The latter purpose of hallpases under my program will not be elminiated at all.  It would be rediculous to have students arriving late to class, not being about to be held accountable.  However, the former usage will be completely elminated.  If you want to leave the classroom, you only have to ask the teacher's permission, you do not need to carry a pass.  If you want to go from the media center to commons or the WRR, you won't need to carry have a pass or sign out, you will just have to leave.  You will, however, be required to sign in in the WRR and Media Center, but that is from a computer security perspective.  If it's your free period, you can do what you want, you can be free.  Also, this in no way affects attendence/EDs.  I'm not saying that you can just leave school or show up late, the state requires that you be accounted for, and I'm not contesting that.  What I am saying is that when I finish my lunch, I should be able to walk to the media center and sign in, free period or not.  That I should be able to walk from the Media Center to the WRR to Commons and back without ever needing a pass.  There is a reason why they are called "free" periods - they are designed to be free.

       Outside of running errands (such as picking up a 10 foot USB cable and a review book for my written EMT test) I mostly spent the day working.  A small job down the street that called for a hard drive extraction (I plan on recovering the data for the people) then a report of Outlook "being slow" in Trumbull.  On the Trumbull call I disabled Word as an e-mail editor, but not before installing Windows XP Service Pack 1.  The computer probably didn't need SP1 to solve the outlook problem, but I can't bill for 10 minutes  ($8) of service if I just drove 24 miles down the parkway, can I?  Besides, XP computers need to latest service packs to prevent crashes and cover up all those security holes that Microsoft keeps finding in their operating system.  It will prevent further calls down the road.  My new HP scanner is coming tomorrow.  I've recently discovered that almost all the products HP makes are cross platform compatible.  Way to go HP!  That combined with the fact they operate the best computer recycling service in the industry makes them my #2 favorite computer company, with Apple obviously taking first.  Also on the table tomorrow is to cut up a tree.  I was watching a movie around 9:30 tonight and suddenly I heard this huge crash.  I paused my TiVo and took a flashlight out to see what was going on.  I didn't see anything for a while, and then I began walking up the dirt driveway that the truck uses.  In the middle of it was a huge limb, about the diameter of a decently sized tree.  I think the rest of the tree is back in the woods, I'll see tomorrow morning.  Anyway, I won't be able to get the truck out unless I remove the tree, so that's on the list of things to do tomorrow.  I'm begining to entriely write off ER9 socially.  Every year I scan a friend's yearbook, because all I need are the digital scans anyway (as a reference, to match faces with names).  I was thinking about calling him up and asking to borrow it, as the scanner is coming in, but then I thought, "Wait.  What do I need pictures of people in Easton for?  Nothing is going to happen there."  The future lies outside this town's borders and everyday I'm making progress.  The question is why isn't this sort of thing possible in Easton?  I'm not quite sure, but at the moment I could care less about the answer.

       My parents are leaving again tomorrow, this time for Florida.  I will relish in the silence that their absence affords me.  Hopefully I'll have a little more time to spend around the house this time.  Recently there have been a good number of supreme court victories for civil liberties advocates.  I take pleasure in the fact that my ACLU membership fee is doing something productive.  The court came close to striking down COPA today, if only they would rule against CIPA (if my memory serves me well they ruled in favor of it a few years back).  No CIPA means no internet access filtering at Joel Barlow.  Unfortunately, I think that's a long way off.  Of course, the rights of "enemy combatants" were secured in the past week and Fairenheit 9/11 is still the top grossing movie at the box office, so there are many victories to celebrate.  I noticed a NY Times article about how Bush's popularity is slipping in the last few days: the chance of limiting his rule to one term is well within possibility.  On a personal note, I am establishing myself out of town.  It's a slow process, one that must be done gradually, but the end result is worth the time and effort.  It's sad that I have to give up on the ER9 school system as a social outlet, but it's reality.    While I'm on this note, I would like to address a common misconception: Many seem to feel that my lack of social success within ER9 is of a result of people knowing about "3/7."  It isn't.  Back when I used to mention to my friends that I was talking to a specific person, they would say, "Oh, she doesn't know about your freshman year.  You'll be alright."  I don't think that 3/7 ever played into any of my social failures, save the first two.  It's such a detached part of my life that it's barely worth remembering, save to write my book (which I am already behind at!).  So why have a gone through six years of public education and not had a girl I could say was a "good friend" of mine?  I it back to poor choices I made in my seventh grade year, namely to like a particular individual.  There were two times that people developed the friendships they have today within the school system (on a whole, of course there are exceptions): middle school and freshman year.  In middle school, and in freshman year, I had girls that were friends (though the meaning of friend, at least for one of them, could be seriously debated).  I, like everyone else, had social connections to a group of people: it just so happened that these people had no connection to my existing friends.  When 3/7 came and went the ties were cut and I entered sophomore year without the connections that my friends had retained.  Since most people had made such connections already, I ended up without those connections, and without any friends that I didn't already have secured from middle school or freshman year.  One of the few "outs" of this situation was to meet people from other towns.  But how?  Sure, I did plenty of things out of town, but they all involved working in business offices and private residences fixing computers.  Not a great way to meet people, and even if I did, I have a policy of keeping my business and personal relationships separate.  All the activities I did with others in my own age group were within town, partially due to the historic pressure from my father to not leave town (save gas!) and partially because I could do almost anything I wanted through my computer and broadband internet connection.  What I needed was a connection, a connection that someone else had to people in other towns, a way to meet new people.  It just so happened that one such a person made an offer to do just that.  And now I am where I am now: the prospect of finishing my high school years up on a completely satisfied social note.  It's sad that I have to give up my own town, after all, there is an element of convience in doing things locally; of seeing people in school, of shorter driving trips, of running into people more frequently.  But two nights ago; for the first time since the summer after my freshman year, I initiated a conversation with a girl online.  Not a girl I liked, not a girl with whom I had any particular social agenda, just a girl who I can consider my friend.  That's all I ever wanted in ER9, but there is no need to reminisce about past failures, for now there are only positive futures as I continue to expand my social connections outside of Easton/Redding.  To the person(s) involved, thank you.

       Went paintballing today with a handful of my friends.  Fun, though the last round I got stuck in a swamp and my legs were covered in mud.  So rather than get my car a mess, I just drove home: barefoot, without pants on.  It was an experience.  However, I got home without getting pulled over or hitting someone else, avoiding the embarasing situation of having to explain to another person why I was driving around without pants.  Then went to a Police Explorers event for two hours.  Parents get back tomorrow.  Too bad, haven't been around the house much to enjoy the silence.  Anyway, they leave for Flordia next week for a few days, that will be enjoyable.

       I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight.  If you support the Iraq war, see this movie.  Unless, of course, you are joining the armed services, since if you're putting your life on the line, you can vote whatever way you want in November.  But for the vast majority of us who are not planning on a military career, there is no excuse to support the war in Iraq after watching this movie.  I don't care if you disagree with everything Moore says about George Bush, the last third of the film should be enough for anyone to drop their support of the war.  I, of course, agree with much of Moore said, which is partially why I went to see the movie in the first place.  While Moore placed heavy emphasis on his family's connections with the Saudis (especially the bin Ladins), I believe that was one of the lesser points of the film.  I strongly disagree with Bush's elitism, and his work ethic in the first year prior to 9/11.  Ultimately, however, the point I took home was this: Our military is made up a volunteer force composed mostly of underprivliged citizens to whom it looks like an excellent option.  They put their lives on the line to protect our country and the only thing they ask is that we deploy them only when our country is in dire need of defense.    Iraq was not a threat.  We shouldn't be there and every casualty there, be it American or Iraqi, is a wasted life.  The first half of the film I was fairly familar with, as I've followed much of the failures of George Bush's policy from his entrence into office.  It was nonetheless scary and amusing at times.  The second half of the movie was what blew me away.  If you've seen Bowling for Columbine you know what I mean when I say Moore doesn't consistently drive home a specific point from start to finish.  Rather, he wanders around, touching on all aspects of an area, but never drawing a final, direct conclusion.  Much of Fahrenheit 9/11 was similar in that regard, but the last quarter simply, eloquently, and effectively drove home a direct message.  Moore gave the war a human side; for the first time we saw the physical and emotional cost of the war, both abroad and at home.  As expected, Moore drove home his point that George Bush lied to the American people, that his response to September 11th was ineffective and halfhearted, that those in power have all to gain and nothing to loose from the war in Iraq.  I still believe that the human face on the Iraqi war was what was most striking.  Advice for the next time anyone goes to a movie:  buy your tickets online.  It may cost a dollar more, but I did it for the first time, and it was unbelivably worth it.  The line for the theater was out the door and along the side of the building, maybe 200-300 people in all.  I just walked right by them, swiped the credit card I purchased the tickets with at this little LCD screen device, and out popped my tickets.  I saved myself 45 minutes.  Unbelivable.

       I spent most of the afternoon and night in Trumbull, with the friends of a friend of mine's.  It was fun, if for nothing else to get more social contacts.  I enjoyed myself greatly overall, though, and would like to thank that individual for bringing me along.  As for the schedule tomorrow, I first have to finish my English final, a write-at-home paper on the meaning of life.  It's officially due tomorrow, so I'm finishing tomorrow morning before I drive it in.  Then I have three different appointments for work, and then Fairenheit 9/11 at 7:30.  If anyone else wants to tag along, let me know, preferably well in advance.  Plus, I have to wakeup early to teach my dad how to use the GPS in his rental car as he and the rest of my family departs tomorrow to drop my sister off in Pennsilvania.  I'm alone for two, maybe three days.  Nice.

       I recieved my letter back from the State: I passed my entire EMT practical, every station.  I was sure I had failed trauma, however maybe forgetting to check AVPU was not a critical criteria.  On to the written exam: July 9th.  Easton EMS here I come.

       Some exciting news today.  Governor Rowland is planning on resigning tonight and the first privately funded manned spaceflight launched into space, reaching an unconfirmed altitude of 62 miles above the earth's surfance.  Now they need to launch again within two weeks in order to win the  urlLink X-Prize .  In my own personal life, things are looking a little less bright.  I proceded with my idea to ride the bus home and pick up my car at school later so I could talk to Cara.  She was on the bus, but didn't sit near me, so I left the bus and simply took the truck home.  Sure, some might argue, her choice of seating might not mean anything.  But how far can I go before I determine something of significance that means I don't have a chance?  She is a nice person - if I sit with her she will talk with me, if I ask her for my screen name she will give it to me.  But none of that would mean anything, except that she doesn't want to hurt me by indicating that she wants to have absolutely nothing to do with me.  So is this the end?  I think so.  I could sit with her tomorrow, talk with her for a while before I go do my Cisco case study, but what good would that do?  Prolong this even longer, even though ultimately things won't work out?  One could argue that we don't know each other so maybe things will work out if we sit down and talk and actually get to know each other.  But I'm not sure whether that would help or hurt things.  Look at my interests, look at what I do in my free time.  Is her knowing about my enviromentalist tendencies, my interest in politics and public affairs, my computer consulting business going to help anything?  Is her getting to know me better going to really do good?  Sure, my EMT training might be interesting, but didn't I already try that with the EMS application?  On the topic of EMS, I have to run down to Easton EMS today, as they have more paperwork I need to fill out.  The results of my state practical should be in sometime during the week.  So it seems as if my Junior year fell into line with my past years in terms of social sucess: none.

       I took my EMT practical today.  I won't know the results till the end of this week (or maybe slightly sooner, I think Thursday is a good projection).  I'm fairly certain that I passed, missing only one station, Trauma, since the scenario threw me off a bit.  Everything else was fine, except I am still debating whether or not I verbalized checking PMS (Pulse-Motor-Sensory function) before and after applying the paitent to a long spine board.  I know I did before and after the KED was applied, but there is still a question in my mind whether I did it with a long spine board.  I'll find out soon, though.  At five I went to Rowyaton to see Shakespeare on the Sound perform The Winter's Tale with some of my AP English class.  While the Winter's Tale is not one of Shakespeare's best works, it was certantly an enjoyable trip.

       Yesterday I declared that today was the last day for progress with Cara.  But as I saw her today I just got the sense that I still have a chance at this.  She is a very nice and attractive person (which few seem to share my belief in the latter, but all the better for me) that I actually have a chance with.  So, I've formulated some desperate measures to have a quick conversation or two and then get her screen name:  1. Drive to school Monday (as planned, I only have 1 exam), but take the bus home Monday.  Hopefully, she will be on and I can talk to her.  I will need to get a ride back to school to pickup my car.  Not a problem.  2.  Go in for the period  four final, and possibly have two and a half hours to talk to her.  Considering that some of her friends probably got rides home and given the fact that there will be few people there, this couldn't be a better opportunity.  Besides, I don't think I've ever had a chance to talk with a girl I like for a good two and a half hours.  Of course, this all depends if she is there, which is somewhat unlikely.  3.  Find her between exams.  It will be hard, she will be with her friends, but I'll just havee to do it.  It's the only fail-safe option.  4.  Find her in the morning and talk to her then.  Not as easy as it may sound.  Now, after all the conversations are over and done with, I'm going to figure out what the quickest, simplest method for obtaining her screen name is.  In other words, I've got to figure out how to ask a girl for her screen name.  And "what's your screen name" is just too blunt.

       I'm going to see  Fairenheit 9/11  when it comes out on the 25th, since I'm a huge Michael Moore fan.  And I'm going to be buying advance tickets so I don't have to wait in line.  If anyone else is interested in seeing it, you are welcome to come.  Let me know, since I'll probably have to get advance tickets for anyone else, also, as I imagine the lines will be long on the day it premieres.

       As usual, complications to my plans occured.  This time, when I got to the free period I shared with Cara, the entire table was filled.  The only time I could have gotten a seat was when she got up and what good would that have done?  As far as I'm concerned, tomorrow's the last day I have.  I won't be in school on Friday or Tuesday.  With finals, I won't really have an opportunity the see Cara on a predictible basis, if at all.  Everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong with this.  I tried talking with her during her free period, it didn't work.  She wasn't on the bus the one day I had someone to distract the freshman, and there wasn't a seat at her table for the one hour and a half free period she shared.  I obtained her screen name but it was old, and I didn't talk with her at the dance in favor of the bus plan, which she wasn't even there for.  What could I possibly do tomorrow that would make my progress with this turn around?  Outside of straight-out asking for her screen name (and I don't like that idea, after, I have really never even had a conversation with her), I don't see any other options.  Maybe I should figure out some way to meet people during the summer.  I don't think there is one, at least not an acceptable one.

       I went down to Easton EMS to practice for my state practical on Saturday with Greg, a fellow EMT student, and Chris, a friend of mine who is currently an EMT.  I immobilized Greg, then Chris took out the Polaroid camera...  but I found out my scanner doesn't work with Windows XP and definately won't work with my Mac, so it looks like I'm going to need to buy a new scanner.  Too bad.  But I did the next best thing...used the macro lens on my digital camera and cropped the photo up a bit:      Greg after I backboarded him    Anyway, I'm going to need a lot more work for my Saturday practical, but I'm sure I can do it.  Just need to memorize those skill sheets.  I also found out that I will get my written exam (and certification) back in about three or four weeks, not the three months I had been told.  That makes me happy.

       Walked by her twice in school today, didn't say anything.  Probably should have.  Maybe I should be asking why she isn't saying "hi" to me.  I have an hour and a half free period to talk to her tomorrow in, I have yet to decide whether or not to take advantage of it, given the difficulties associated with the first time I tried that.  See my Wi-Fi editorial in the Mosiac.  I was assembling a lamp for my dad (for father's day) and I shatered the expensive, energy efficent bulb.  That means about $20 and a trip to home depot this week.  At least my mom is paying, since we jointly screwed up.  I still have 1 1/4 boxes of the CFLs to use, and I have nowhere else to put them.  It's probably better to have too many CFLs than not enough.  If you don't use CFLs in your home, you should.    "Now it's absolutely clear to me that solitude is not the same as singularity. But that's not why I'm lonely.   No, that's not why I'm lonely."

       So unless some miracle happens, it looks like I should be settling in for a nice, enjoyable summer with me, myself, and my G5.  And my energy star air conditioner.  Given the locations in which I work (private homes and company offices) I don't meet people over the summer, unless I go on trips with other students, none of which are planned for this year.  So if this thing with Cara doesn't work out, I'm isolated for the summer.  Oh well, that's nothing new, I should be used to it now.  I recieved a new shipment of CFLs today.  I have way too many to use, but almost 80% of our lighting is now done with CFLs.  The other 20% is not used enough to make it viable to make the change.  And I wonder why no one will go out with me?

       From what I can conclude the screen name I have of her's is old...another dead end.  This is looking like the time to give up on this.

       Cara wasn't on the bus.  Figures.  That's my kind of luck.  This is the first anomaly all year, figures it occurs on a critical day.  There are other people I'm interested in, but they are more random than her.  At least she shares a bus ride with me and besides I don't have any time left to get to know someone totally new.  I'm going to have to figure something else out, or just plain forget about her.

       I bought an Applecare 3 year waranty for $250.  Since my mom paid half, I figured it was a good deal.  I'm going to get this problem (G5 crashes) solved once and for all.  I went to the school dance Friday night.  As usual, terrible turnout.  I'd write a bit on why school dances are horrible failures and why that is, but I don't feel like typing a lot at the moment.  I, like most people, never go to them.  But since I knew people who were going, I opted in.  Cara was there.  Dispite the urging on my friends, I didn't say a word to her the whole night.  I'm not that type of person, and I'm not well suited towards those type of situations.  I'm much more comfortable talking with her on the bus.  So Monday I'm going to talk to her on the bus.  I've employed a friend to distract the annoying freshman, and I would like to take this moment to thank them.  Your help might be the difference between me having a relationship with her and being alone this summer.  On the topic of thanks, I would also like to thank another friend for their ingenuity in obtaining Cara's screenname.  Both your efforts are greatly appreciated.  I now (as mentioned above) have her screen name.  Or I did until I dropped the piece of paper I had it written on at the dance.  But that can be remedied.  Unfortunately, much like knowing her name was for a while, I can't use the screenname until I actually ask her for it, which I'd like to do before the end of the coming week.  For those of you following the situation, Monday is the make-it or break-it day.  I'll have enough of a conversation with her to gauge whether or not I actually have a chance.  Be prepared for the update then.  Next Saturday is also my EMT practical, so this week will involve heavy practices in preparation for it.  I recieved my letter from the state in the mail today confirming the date and giving me directions to the location.  I'm fairly confident in my abilities however I'm still a bit shaky on splinting a long bone, depending upon what bone it is.  I fear that in my nerviousness I will forget to imobilize it in a position of function, or forget to check PMS (Pule-Motor-Sensory function) before I begin splinting.  Which reminds me, I'd better start memorizing the SAMPLE and OPQRST questions to ask.  I'd better get going...

       Done with work early today, so I'm in a fairly good mood.  I was expecting to be stuck at an office for hours, troubleshooting one problem that I already spent an hour and a half on.  However, after about twenty five minutes, I figured out it was a server-side issue, made the necessary correct and all was good.  I didn't expect to be home till at least six, but being back at four thirty was great.

       Went to Redding Ridge Fire Dept to practice for the EMT practice tonight.  Maybe I should just forget the social pursuits and stick to EMT.  Anyway, I'll keep the social thing up for a bit; who knows maybe I have a chance.  Maybe not.  I'd like to side with the latter, but it doesn't hurt to keep it up for another week, if for nothing else to say I tried and failed.

       I knew things were going too well.  I just had a sense; things were not going to work out his easy.  Now, I still could be wrong, but today there was something of a test case.  Before I get to that, however, I will briefly summarize the events of yesterday morning.  Since she rides the bus every morning, I realized that it was time to make a move.  Up until that point I had not "offically," know her name, and for that matter, she probably didn't know mine.  I decided that I would solve this problem quickly and easily yesterday morning.  As I got off the bus, I introduced myself, and she told me her name was Cara.  Nothing new there.  So anyway, one of the founding theories that many people used in the basis of their determination that I might actually have a chance was the fact that she always stopped everyone and let me out of my seat on the bus every morning.  Of course, this was always under the assumption that I was the only one that she did this for.  But this morning, things were arranged in such a way that she let another student out also.  In other words, she just being nice all this time.  And since she was right behind me and based on my actions to previous two days it was fairly clear that I have an interest with her.  So, if she knew this, and she was standing right behind me, why didn't she at least say "hi" to me?  I made eye contact with her.  She had a chance.  Why didn't she give any indication that might show that I have a chance?  Nothing horribly wrong has gone, but I don't let the fact that nothing has gone unbelivably well.

       As if I haven't bored all of my readers already, I share with you the latest developments with Cara.  I knew that today I had to do something.  It was the first of only two more chances that I had to talk to her on the bus.  This afternoon I boarded the bus as quickly as possible to get ahead of her.  I was sucessful in that aspect.  The annoying freshman boy was there.  He immediately began questioning me about the fuel efficenency of school busses.  What a topic.  I mostly ignored his questions, staring out of the bus windows, mostly looking for Cara so I would know when to be ready to silence him.  "What are you looking for?" he asked. "Nothing, I'm just staring out the window." I replied. "Are you looking for that kid that parks at your house?" "No, he isn't coming today."  Cara boarded the bus.  She walked down the isleway, and as she did I made eye contact with her.  "Hey," I said.  She replied in the same manner, and was very friendly.  Today, rather than sitting all the way across from me, she sat directly behind me.  She was no more than two feet behind me.  Just as she began to sit down, though, the freshman kid stuck his head up.  "Is that what you were waiting for?"  I wanted to reach out and just give him a nice blow to the side of the head.  What the hell was he thinking?  Could there have been a worse line he could have used at that moment?  "No, no.  I was just looking to see if Dave would be riding today.  I never know when he parks at my house."  My reply might have been convincing to him, but I doubt that she believed it.  Nevertheless, it seemed that she was just waiting for me to turn around and talk to her.  I felt her legs pushing into the back of my seat as she played with her hair.  So close...but so far.  Everytime I went to talk to her, the annoying freshman would spout another question.  "I saw an old bus yesterday on the highway.  Aren't those less efficent, since they have a big thing sticking out the front?"  I acknolwdged his question, but kept my head towards the window.  She was doing the same.  "What about hyrdogen cars, when are they going to be availible?"  "2020."  "Aren't hyrdogen cars going to be better?  How can you get hyrdogen?  Why can't we just burn water?"  He wouldn't shut up.  I left the bus without being able to say another word to her.  I got the sense that she wanted to talk to me, that was good.  But it could have gone so much farther, had that kid in front of me not been there.  A frustrating feeling.

       How many days are left?  13 Days to my EMT Practical 12 (School) Days left (for me) 9  (School) Days to Finals 8 Days to my EMT Final 7  Days left to talk to Cara in commons 2  Days left to talk to Cara on the bus  Not included is the huge quanitity of projects I have due, mostly for my AP classes.  And I thought I would get to relax after the exam...what a mistake.

       For once I'm posting an entry from school.  I generally avoid such things, in part due to the sluggish speed of the school's internet connection, but mostly due to the fact that the school's network administrators frequently scan each computer.  While I see such scanning as a necescity to preserving security on the network, I fear that they do not confine themselves to scanning for suspicious activitity.  In theory, if they scan my screen and I'm typing this, they should notice that I'm not violating any school policy, and continue on.  But rather, if they are bored, they will likely stop and read what I am writing: this is a violation of my privacy.  Nevertheless, I feel the need to update the situation from school, since likely when I get home I will not have to do so.  Between a rank meeting with the Police Explorers and an awards ceremony tonight, I will have little time to complete my AP US History Outline or study for my math quiz, let alone write a blog entry.  With period four mostly being devoted to social pursuits, I am relatively limited in the amount of time I can devote to such things during school hours.  Period four today provided me little opportunity for action.  As I entered the room, Cara and one of her friends were busy at work assembling two large posterboards that occupied most of the table.  There was no logical reason I could have for sitting down and talking with them.  I determined that there was a good opportunity for conversation before the bell rang, as I could approach her and casually ask what class  it was for.  However, she obtained permission to leave early to put her poster away, and by the time I was on my feet she was out of the room.  There now is a worry about competition.  There was another guy today, someone who looked remotely like someone who might have an edge over me, talking to her.  Now of course that doesn't mean he has any interest in her, and being an underclassman (freshman or sophmore I couldn't tell) I would supposedly have an advantage in that aspect.  I question if it is enough of an advantage.  Or will this end up being another case on the long list of cases where another guy liked the girl I did, and they won out.  Outside of the miserable failures of the first two individuals (a mostly parent-driven event known as 3/7), this is how everyone I've ever liked has ended up.  Except that girl last year, but there are exceptions to every rule.  However, competion is not an issue for me right now.  What is an issue is finding an opportunity to talk to her.  Right now I have 2 more bus rides and 9 more free periods.  Is that really enough, considering the meager progress I've made in the last two?  Or am I destined again to leave the school year on the note of failure, with the realization that likely things will be no different next year?

       Today was an interesting, albeit frustraing, day.  I sat with her in commons.  Her and her friends.  But I came to the realization about conversations - almost everything they talked about I couldn't comment on.  They talked about movies I had never seen, actors they thought were attractive, books I had never heard of, and going to see the Harry Potter movie on Friday.  Outside of borrowing a pen and eventually a bottle of whiteout, I only broke into the conversation once when one girl mentioned something about Easton being a terrible place to live.  Cara sat there the whole time working with a friend on math homework, then she took to reading.  I have no idea what to do.  Since I mostly sat with my head burried in my EMT book, I fear that if I come back I will appear to be a some strange junior who has no friends so he resorts to sitting with a group of freshmen girls.  I question whether or not there is even a chance for this to work out.  If I go back tomorrow, what do I talk about?  I can't follow any of their conversations.  I don't know them, they don't know me.  What can I say?  Maybe I should just give up, and live out the rest of my high school years the way I have done thus far.  I'd hate to do it, and I won't enjoy it, but every individual I have met has had the same problem: they are near-random individuals that I meet somewhere and have little connection to.  And I've talked to tons of different people from different towns and different states, and no one has been able to answer to question: how do you get to know someone you have no connection to?

       I've thought of an even better idea: lightbulb fundraising!  So, I announce the creation of:       I will be working on this business in the coming months.  I plan to start solliciting organizations to begin a pilot fundraising program with around early July, so if you know of an organization that might like to try out this unique idea, let me know.  An organization of 20 people can expect to make about $1,000, with no cash upfront.  An organization of 40 people can expect $1,800-$2,000.

       Yesterday, struggling with the idea of randomly sitting down with Cara during her free period, I came up with a great idea.  I needed to finish filling out my application for Easton EMS, so I figured I'd bring it.  I'd head to commons and take an empty table next to her and her group of friends.  I'd then proceed to realize I didn't have a pen, and go across to her table and ask if I could borrow one to fill out a form.  Upon the recieving the pen, I'd just fill out the form at her table, which would not only gain me access to her table but it could also act as a conversation starter.  I arrived today in commons during period four and signed in.  I checked the sign-in sheets, and sure enough  she had signed in every day for the past week, so she was bound to be there.  I scaned the room.  She had not yet arrived, even though I was already a minute past the bell.  I took my seat and after about five minutes, no Cara.  I took a pass to media center, and she was not there.  I later checked the writing room sign-in sheet, and her name was not listed for period four.  I looked for her in the hallways for the rest of the day, just to say hi, but I couldn't find her.  Tomorrow, I'll try to pull off the same thing.  Hopefully she'll be there.  I only have eleven days left to talk with her during the free period, and only two remaining oppertunites on the bus.  Time is running out.  Fast.   I also had another business idea: sell lightbulbs.  Not any lightbulbs, mind you, but energy efficent lightbulbs.  I can purchase these bulbs at $1 a piece from a source I have and they sell in stores for about $5-6.  I'd price them at $5.  Each lighbulb will save the owner $30.24 over the bulb's lifetime, so they are certantly worth the investment, plus they are good for the enviroment.  Now, assuming that I sell them on a wide scale, I can allot around .75 for advertising for each bulb I sell, and it will cost me .72 for each lightbulb in credit card processing fees.  Assuming I can sell lightbulbs to about 500 homes which buy three each, I can make $3,671.75, which comes to about $2,753.81 after taxes.  Still, $3,000 is a lot of money.  I'm not sure where I want to get started on this yet, but I'm considering ordering 100 bulbs to try the idea out.  If anyone on my blog, or anyone's parents want to buy them, just let me know, I'll offer a discount at $4 a bulb.  Considering the savings, it's a steal.  Plus, they last for 6 times what an incandescant lightbulb lasts for and they output the same amount of light.

       Droped my parents of at Hertz this morning for their trip to Pennsilvania to pick up my sister.  I have the house to myself tonight.  After droping my parents off, I stopped at Radio Shack where I spent $83 on rechargable batteries that charge in 15 minutes as opposed to the normal 14 hours that batteries take to charge.  The only reason I need these is my digital camera always runs out of batteries at the most inconvient times, and my mom usually only gives me about an hours notice when she needs batteries for her camera (which is my old one, that I sold to her).  I spent the majority of the time there talking to a friend who I ran across in the store, until his palm pilot alerted him he had something else to do.  I then stopped over at Trader Joes to pick up some food, then went home until I needed to leave to work the with Police Explorers at the carnival.

       I recieved my new watch today, finally crossing off an "atomically syncronized timepiece" off the list of things that I intend to buy during my lifetime.  Now I'll have the exact time, right down the to second, everyday.  Other than that and a job in New Canaan today, not much else is new.

       Almost two years ago, this time, I underwent an application process for a little-known service called  urlLink Google Answers .  The idea of Google answers was to assemble a team of highly qualified internet researchers who would answer questions for others.  In return for the research, the asker of the question would post a dollar amount along with it, 75% of which would go to the researcher.  My application was accepted, and I passed through the inital spot checks, permanently securing my position in a rather elite group of others, save internet research is concerned.  For whatever reason, I just have a knack for it.  As of recent I haven't done much GA work, though I do try and make it to the site occasionally to answer an occasional question.  Few of the GA researchers participate in the program for money, for the time required to go into each answer is usually far more than the dollar amount of question is worth.  Rather, researchers find it enjoyable, informative, a great way to develop even finer research strategies, as well as a way to help others and earn a little extra cash.  So, when there is something I'm looking for on the internet, I don't stop till I find it.  This is almost usually a plus, but in some ways can be a negitive (sometimes it would be better that I didn't find a site, or I end up finding out more than is suitable for my own good).  One of the skills that I've really developed recently is to find sites that are not indexed (or are not well searchable) in a major search engine, such as Google.  For example, I traced down the website of a small, unsigned band that wasn't in Google.  Everytime I search for it I got an unmanageable amount of results about a web development technology that shared the same name.  Knowing that the internet radio station that I heard it on was out of Seattle, I added "seattle" to the search query and I found a list of unsigned bands out of Seattle.  On that site, the band was listed, and so was their website.  Another interesting method of finding such unlisted sites is linking on other sites.  For example, if one was looking for a blog of a particular individual, where would they start?  Since very few blogs (save this one) contain a person's full name, searching for that in Google wouldn't yield any results.  Besides, many blogs aren't indexed by search engines, but with Blogger being owned by Google, blogger users (such as myself) are now being indexed much better.  However, many people place lists of their friend's blogs on their own site.  Ultimately, if you know someone in the same geographic area as another person (whose blog you do know), you can try and trace them through these lists.  I bring this up because I such social connections facinating.  You may not know someone, but a friend of a friend of a friend of your's might know them.  If you navigate to the right pages, if you find the right lists, you can get where you want to be.  I find it facinating the extreeme breadth of connections we have to others through our own, and there is no better way to demonstrate this through these friend lists on blogs.  Just an observation.  I haven't really been watching the Democratic Convention, because, despite my loyalty to the party as of late, they are simply rehashing the same issues over and over again.  I know the damage the Bush administration is doing, and I know the importance of getting them out of office.  But I don't need to hear the same things rehashed a thousand different times by different speakers.  On another note, I will be in New York for the Republican Convention.  As a protester.

       The fireman's carnival in town began tonight, which means that I'll be spending the week directing traffic with the  urlLink Police Explorers .  The event rained out tonight, which alloted me some more free time to myself.  Also canceled today was a large VPN installation I had scheduled in Trumbull.  Unfortunately, the person I was supposed to meet had taken the first part of the week off and won't be back till tomorrow, so I'll have to find a time later in the week I can stop by and meet with them to plan things out.  All in all, I've had a tremendous amount of free time today.  I spent it mostly around the house, though I did file my OS-114 Sales and Use Tax Return with the State of Connecticut today.  Basically, it's a form I file quarterly for my business with which I remit all the sales tax I've collected over the past quarter.  It was due on the second of August, but I usually e-file it a few days in advance.  Other than that, not much is going on here.

       When I ordered my G5, I paid twice as much for overnight shipping. I celebrated the day that UPS and FedEx introduced date-definate Ground delivery. When I bought my (replacement) TiVo last year, I paid for second day shipping. As a rule, I'll pay for Air unless an item is close enough to arrive in three days or less via Ground.  I'll admit it, I'm an impaitent person, sometimes horribly impaitent.  There are times I can wait forever, with infinate paitence, but when I really want something is not one of them.  Thus, I routinely pay higher prices in stores or pay extra for fast shipping so I can have my purchases as fast as possible.  This isn't a problem, I factor it into the cost of buying an item, and if it's a business related purchase, I can deduct the cost from my income tax return.  The problem is that the real world doesn't move at such a fast pace.  There is a girl I like, outside of the town of Easton.  As is usual with my luck and such things, the day after I met her she departed for a month and  a half overseas vacation.  I know that everyday that passes might be another day of summer lost, but it's also another day closer to when she gets back.  I recognized that, being from out of town, the most I would see her would be about once a month (in general, assuming we weren't going out) during the school year, all at specifically arranged events.  And likely some of those she would be unable to make.  So I decided that I had to arrange a few such events between the time of her return and August 30th.  That gave me 15 days, not a lot to work with, but decent enough.  But I recalculated this morning.  If you get back from a day and a half vacation, you're going to want to relax for a few days.  Once I accounted for that time, I was left with 11 days.  Which is nothing.  Two events in 11 days, maximum.  Even assuming that I then talk to her online after those 11 days, I don't think that's enough to get to know her well enough to do something specifically with her, or even her and a friend (which is a complicating factor, as her friends are not the same as my friends, save the two people I know from the town she lives in).    So now I don't know what to do.  I've been waiting about a month, a little less, and it has been torturous.  I can't wait a month in between events, that's not an option.  My friend, who used to know her, simply told me, "well, I hate for me to put so much effort into a complete failure," if I'm not willing to wait.  If there was someone else in the meantime, that would be different.  I went into this wanting to just find some friends to talk to, and after the first event, I emerged with three people, one whom I'm friends with, one who coordinates activities in that town for me, and one who I liked.  If there was, say, two or three girls from that town I could talk to in my free time I would, and I might be able to wait it out.  But that's not the case.  Besides, in those months I wait, isn't there a very good chance she could end up going out with someone else and where does that leave me?  Waiting is not an option.  The school year is stressful enough, not to mention the college admissions processs, and I'd like something that's overwhelmingly positive in my life, for once.  Maybe it will work out after that period of time.  But I don't think so.  My friend, who was previously predicting my sucess, does not believe it will work out in that time, that I will need to wait.  If I could talk to her twice a week or so between the meetings, it might be tolerable.  But I don't know if even that's possible.

       While I'm in a very good mood (and have been in the last few days, since I've been told that it's likely things with the girl I like will work out), I'd like to make a few points (since if I talk about how well the social situation is supposed to go, it will give away who it is).  There is a really quick way for me to make money.  Charge what people use me for: information.  If you've ever called technical support for a computer company (which you probably haven't done, because you called me) and your computer was out of waranty, they will usually have a recording like this: "Support can be purchased for computers without a warranty for $20 per incident or 1.99 per minute.  If the problem isn't solved, your money will be refunded."  If I started doing that, on a per incident basis (not a per call basis, mind you), I'd have a 2004 Prius sitting in my driveway by the end of the year.  Now, I'm not talking about calls from my clients.  I'm talking about calls from everyday students, like most of my readers are.  Everyday I am bombarded with requests to fix broken computers, find information that isn't too hard to find if you use Google, do research, provide advice on technical and legal matters, and utilize my bank accounts and credit cards to buy things for people online.  On an average day, I might net $80-$100 if people always took advantage of the service.  It would only take about 100 days of doing what I normally do every day  to buy myself a nice used Insight.  But if I waited about 3/4 of a year, I could buy myself a nicely equipped Prius.  Or I could save my money, invest it, and buy something even better when the opportunity comes along.  Of course, no one would opt for the charge.  But my point is this: everyday, before trying to help themselves, people call me.  They call me before they look something up on Google, before they call tech support, acting as if my life is devoted to solving their problems, or buying them things on eBay (which I find especially bothersome, because by now people can get their own checking accounts with parental permission, they are just too lazy to argue for it).  People don't realize my time is valuable.  This, of course, does not apply to everyone who asks for my assistance.  There is a select group of individuals who helps me regularly, and in return, I'm always glad to help them.  When I'm standing around, I have no problem with people firing questions at me, I understand that to some I am a good source of answers.  But I do object to those who have conversations with me that constantly revolve around the phrase, "I have a question to ask you."     Since I started typing this, however, my wonderful mood has almost evaporated.  Maybe it's just because it's late and I need sleep, but I'm doubting that the situation with this girl I like will even work out.  I'd provide details into my specific reasoning, but it would tip off some of my readers as to her identity, and that can't be allowed.  Normally, I'd sit back and not worry about it until I actually have to take some action (which isn't for almost another month), but if this does not work out, that's the end of everything for my senior year, as the chance of anything happening in ER9 is nil.  I just hope that the fact that I live in the desolate town of Easton doesn't bring this thing down.  Oh, to live anywhere but here!     I have to mention that since I wrote the above, another request for support was recieved.  However, I had absolutely no problem with it, as it was the first time this person requested support, and they made it very clear that they understood that they were taking my time and appoligized for doing so.  People, even if they don't do anything for me, are always welcome to ask me questions, it's those that bother me constantly or because they don't utilize other resources that are easily accessible that get on my nerves.

       As promised yesterday, here is the text of the letter I sent into the Fairfield Minnuteman, in case you don't get it:   To the Editor:  	An article was published in last week’s Fairfield Minuteman regarding the town of Easton’s recently launched web site.  As a town resident, Joel Barlow High School student, and part time computer consultant, I have long been an advocate for such a site, which would provide a way for the community to access information about town events, policies, and services available to them.  In the article, our First Selectman William Kupinse was quoted as saying that he did not want to hire a professional webmaster to maintain the site, as he wanted to keep “taxes as low as possible.” 	As a computer consultant I offer website development services to a variety of organizations, and wanting to assist the town, I offered to design and maintain a website for the town completely free of charge two years ago.  Neither Mr. Kupinse nor anyone else from the town ever responded to my offer.  Instead, the town recently paid a Prospect, CT based firm to design the site.  If the town was interested in saving tax dollars, I question why they did not first seek to utilize the resources of town residents such as myself and have the site designed free of charge.  Ross Nizlek    Today was relatively uneventful, I was away all day visiting colleges with my parents.  This is one of the first days that I've come home and not had any voicemails waiting for me, which is a good thing.

       After rediscovering that my server had site statistics (I knew it did, I just didn't it would track a subdivision of an account, like my blog is) I was impressed on average I get 20 unique vistors a day.  The last few days it's gotten as high as thirty, a very impressive figure.  I knew that the readership of my blog has increased lately, even without the site statistics.  It's a nice feeling, but it also comes with responsibility: in the past, I could make comments being relatively sure that those I was writing about wouldn't read them, or just as worse, that the friends of the people I was talking about wouldn't read them.  Not that I say anything negitive about anyone on here, since I really get along with everyone.  More of concern is letting certain people know things that would best be kept a secret, at least for the moment.  Nevertheless, I wouldn't for a second discourage any readship of the site, after all it's a public web page, and anything I write I should assume will be read by everyone I know.  Also, if you are a Fairfield/Easton resident, take a look at the letters section of the Fairfield Minnuteman...I sent a letter in that got published.  If you aren't a Fairfield/Easton resident, I'll have a scan of the letter shortly (or more likely, an text copy of my letter, to save on bandwidth).

       Since as of recent, I've been on a fuel-efficent vehicle rampage, I thought I'd point out that the Sierra Club launched a site that parodies a lot of Bush enviromental legislation surrounding the hummer, and the hummer itself.

       I don't think there has ever been a teenager who tries to be so hard to deal with when they are discussing getting him a car.  Of course, I'd have to pay for a poriton of it's costs. But even still, most would step out of the way and take what their parents are willing to give them.  I'm digging my heels in for a fight.  I can't be seen driving something that's not enviromentally friendly.  My dream, of course, is to get a Honda Insight with custom plates reading "65 MPG."    However, my dad will never agree to allow me to have my Insight, and all other hybrids are far too expensive.  So I've been looking at other enviromentally friendly cars.  I print out a list of the top ten fuel efficent cars and encribed in large letters across the top: "THESE ARE THE CHOICES."  I intend to hand to to my parents later.  I may not be able to get a hybrid, but at least I can get a fuel efficent car and get custom plates that read "NO SUVS"  Ah, the joys of being an enviromentalist.

       My AP scores are in!  AP US History: 5 out of 5 AP English: 4 out of 5  Both should allow me to bypass those courses my freshman year of college, given my scores.  In other news, a forest fire north of Los Angelos was caused by a hawk that burst into flame after coming to rest on a high voltage power line.  Stranger things have happened...but not by much.

       Went up to take a look at UConn today.  My reaction: it's nice, but it's more rural than Easton.  The school is large, a nescescity for being in the middle of nowhere, and it's out if I want a business degree (as apparently, to get into med school, there are only four science courses you need to take and you can major in whatever you want) as you have to rent  a laptop from them your second and third year.  I'm 1) Not buying a laptop that will likely cost about $2400 to only use it two years, and 2) Not renting a laptop, as I'm only going to use a Mac.  I can't be subject to the irreliablity and vulernabilities of the Microsoft Windows operating system while I'm at college, and 10.4 will make it a snap to be unbelivably organized (with spotlight).  I was disapointed in the fact that they don't have the library wired for wireless internet, but that's something I can deal with.  I also need to find out the details of the EMS service there, as that's a major considerating in choosing schools.  Because of it's location, there really isn't another EMS service I could join other than the on-campus one.  It's a nice school, the facilities are nice, my only reservation is I'd have to get everything shipped in (there's no place to buy computer parts or 100% recycled paper up there) and that I'd never leave the campus (There is nowhere to go, the first remenant of civilization is forty minutes by bus).  Anyway, based upon numerous comments, I'm searching for a replacement for my blogger profile picture, one that is supposedly more representative of me.  I should dig up a replacement in a day or two.

       After the Explorer meeting, which was fairly unproductive due to the abscence of our Lieutenant (by no fault of his own, mind you), ended at eight o'clock and after driving someone home to gain the privlidge of accessing mapquest through their computer, I took the Merrit (Parkway, for you non-CT readers) down a few exits and spent the evening at a friend's house in Trumbull.  Of course, I was late because of the Explorer meeting, and so I really floored it.  My average speed was 75 and my top was 82, and I just stayed in the left lane as I flew by a 55 MPH speed limit sign.    Anyway, it was fun, and it's always nice to get out of the house every once in while.  30 days.

       Unlike many of the scantly updated and vaugely worded blogs of my friends, there are some blogs that are written not for just an immediate group of friends but also for the general public.

       I'm proudly announcing the removal of the hybrid count from my blog.  Why proudly?  Because since now everytime I leave the confines of Easton, I spot another hybrid, and that's just too many to count.   85% of them (approx) are '04 Priuses (and the rest are mostly '01 Priuses).  It seems that the hybrid car market is flourishing, especially with the incredibly inovative Prius, so why bother to count them anymore?  I simply take comfort in knowing they are out there.  For you SUV-fiends, Ford is releasing their hybrid Escape this summer.  If you have $26,000 to spend on an SUV, that's what you'd better get (clearly if you are buying a $20,000 SUV that's too much to ask).  But for those about to plunk down $27,000 for a Ford Explorer, think again.  Maybe, for once, you should consider someone other than yourself.  Besides, people might be nicer to you on the road.  I, for  one, go out of my way to cut off any SUV that gets under 20 to the gallon (Ford Explorer equivelent or larger), to not wave them on, to never let them out.  You show total disregard for anything but your own selfish interests, then I'll only show regard for mine.  I understand that people like SUVs because of the winters here, and that's perfectly fine.  But get something with four wheel drive and good ground clearance that doesn't destroy the air.  I have a particular problem with people who drive hummers.  Now, I happen to know someone who drives a military surplus humvee and to set the record straight, I have no problem with that.  First, you are recycling a vehicle, and vehicle production uses a lot of natural resources.  You can actually take this thing just about anywhere you need to go  (I happened to ride in it once when it pulled itself over rocks two feet in height) and if you have the experience to fix up and maintain one of these things, good for you, you deserve it.  My problem is with civilian hummers, with one caveat: if you actually use the hummer for what it's designed for, you are exempted from my wrath.  But no one does, and this especially true with the Hummer H2.  The logic behind the car?  "Let's make a big, expensive, off roading vehicle that pollutes like mad, but design it for highway driving, so people have an excuse to show off their wealth and pollute even more for no reason."  If you drive a hummer that says two things about you: 1) You have money to burn and 2) You don't give a shit about anyone else.  In fact, your going to get a vehicle that damages the air people drive more than any other vehicle on the market (commercial trucks excluded, but they actually serve a useful purpose), to just prove how much disregard you have for the rest of hummanity.  Which is why most hummer owners are probably Republicans (though the only one I know, excluding the military surplus guy, is a Democrat).  If I see a hummer I make especially sure to get in their way and make life difficult for them.  (I'm sure I'll now recieve a wrath of criticism, but all it will focus on how such vehicle are "cool" and totally disregarding everything about the environment.)

       I tend to be a realistic person.  Sometimes a bit cynical, but I try to be realistic.  But, for sanity's sake, I've deceided to temporarily suspend belief in reality, and pretend that a nice, inteligent, attractive girl might seriously consider me if I asked her out.    (Give it a month or two and I'll have a rude awakening back into reality)  But for now, it's all good.  I have a chance.

       I like knowing things in advance.  I like knowing what's going on, constantly evaulating whether things are going as planned.  That's probably because most of my "great ideas" don't come when I'm sitting in front of my computer, but when I'm trying to fall asleep at night or in the middle of a borning job, watching graphics scroll by on a screen.    So my current situation bothers me.  I am told by my Easton contact to just "Sit back and watch" while he and the Trumbull contact resolve my situation.  But in all honesty, I don't think anything is going on.  For whatever reason, I think I percieve some indifference on the part of the Trumbull conact to my situation.  And I couldn't blame her, since it's a rather difficult one to deal with.  She informed me that the girl I like in Trumbull won't be getting back to August 15th.  I felt that excludes her from consideration at the moment, whereas my contact does not.  "if you really want her.  wait for her.  what's a month?"  She has a valid point.  But I can't say "I really want her."   What I really want is to avoid another disasterous failure.  My reply: "well, from what I hear she's very intelligent, and from my own experience she's nice and attractive. but who knows, she may get back and decide she doesn't like me. then what have I waited for? i don't think I have much of a chance meeting someone during the school year."  I was then accused of thinking of thinking of everything "too practically."  I supposedly need to "go with the flow."  But I did that.  That was junior year, and nothing came of it.  How can I go with the flow when I will never see these people except in arranged meetings?  When every contact has to go through my Easton contact to my Trumbull contact and then back down the same path again?  Once school starts, I'm never going to see these people.  During the summer the most I would see them is twice a month.  During the school year maybe I'll see them three to four times over 8 months.  And that's being optimistic.  If I can arange a few more meetings this summer and walk away with a girlfriend, then maybe all this wasn't a waste of my time.  Something inside of me tells me I should have pushed a little harder on the move out of Easton campaign a little harder.  But it's too late for that.  My sister might be on board now, but I'd rather live out the rest of my high school in Easton than move to Carlise, PA.  You probably can't even get deccent broadband access there.  But now it's too late.  Even if I a compromise could be reached and my parents convinced, by the time everything was closed and done and a house was found, it would be far too late into my senior year to change anything.  I don't know what to do.  Maybe I should just trust the two people who are working on this and relax.  But as each day goes by, that's one less chance of having things work out.  I'd rather go out and meet other people, not put all my eggs in one basket.  But whatever.  Maybe I should let them handle it and have someone to blame when it fails.  I hate being so negitive.

       It's only been a few days since my last post, and already I'm hearing vocal complaints for a loyal reader of my blog.  Why have I not posted?  It is usually one of two reasons: I'm not doing anything interesting or I'm wholly content with my life for the moment, so I don't feel the desire to comlain about it publically.  Both were applicable during my abscence from posting, and now both are urgining me to post again.  Since the day I announced to my father that I wanted to pursue a carear in emergency medicine, he has suggested that I get a job at my uncle's vetrinary hospital (Davis Animal Hospital, in Norwalk.  He also owns several others, but doesn't work at them).  He argued that essentially medicine was medicine and it would give me a feel for the career and was a good way to pick up some experience.  So I finally did.  Today was my first day on the job, I'm working twice a week, in addition to my regular computer consulting.  My only regret is I have to get up early, which just means that on Mondays and Wednesday I'm deprived of sleep.  I realized, while working today, that the fifteenth of July is three days away.  That means that July is almost half over, and that the summer is almost a quarter over.  Since school got out, I've gone to Trumbull twice.  In reality, when one takes into account the distance, the logisitical issues, the fact that I only know a few people well there, I'm only going to get to see them about twice a month, and that's during the summer.  My Easton contact's response?  "Well, alright, in that case give up."  That was a lot of help.  My conclusion?  As I explained to him, "I think that ultimately the only feasible, logistically possible solution here is to get a girlfriend out of those whole thing. Sure, I'd be friends with these people, and it would be fun, and it doesn't matter then if I see them once a month or once every two months."  Which might sound like a fine idea.  But in practice, given my sucess record, is there any indication that such a thing might even work?  One might argue that because these are people from a different town I will have a better chance.  But I've tried different strategies before: I tried finding a girl a grade below me, and when that didn't I tried, finding one two grades below me.  The two girls that I met from other towns that I liked (on trips) both didn't work out because I wasn't the only guy who liked the girl and I ended up on the short end of things.  Plus, there isn't much I can do.  As I explained to me Easton contact, "If I could "get going" I would. But I can't. I have to wait for her to come back, then I have to wait for [my trumbull contact] to be online, then I have to find a time when [my trumbull contact's], [the girl I like from trumbull's], and my schedules all work, along with a good number of other Trumbull people for cover. And even then all that is out of my hands."

       The EMT test wasn't bad.  I finished it in about an hour and fifteen minutes (max time is 2 1/2 hours) and I think I passed.  After all, it was only the state test, not the national.  Afterwards, all of us that were there went out to eat, and then I got back here around 10:30.  Now I've just got to wait about a month to find out if I passed.

       EMT test today.  It's supposedly to be a horrrible test, though I'm sure I'll pass it (or that could just be irrational overconfidence).  Anyway, you need a 70% to pass, which means that out of 150 questions I can get 45 wrong.  Not bad.  Better get back to the books...

       I'm home from another Trumbull outing, which if for no other reason, is fun because it is an intreruption in the cycle of work-home on G5-sleep-repeat.  So I was sitting in this girl's house, the one that I commonly refer to as the Trumbull "source" or the person who arranges everything on that end, and she sits down next to me with the yearbook for Trumbull High.  "Alright," she says, "You need to pick out a girl."   And she began leafing through the pages, pointing out who was availible and who was not.  Of course, this is exactly what I critisized someone for yesterday: shopping for girls as if they are a commodity.  I had long conceded that I was not interested in finding a girlfriend - I was interested in developing a group of friends from Trumbull.  If a girlfriend came of that, fine, but it was not even on a list of things I was looking for.  Now I'm faced with the question: which is easier - trying to meet and get to know 15 people casually (at least to the point I can have a conversation with them online) or getting to know one person enough to ask them out?  I'm not quite sure.   I'm sure at least one person is going to reply to this post and say, "do both."  In anticipation of that, let me explain: All these events are coordinated by a contact in Trumbull.  They can invite random people or they can invite specific people.  So if I want to get to know a specific person, I need to provide their name so they will be specifically invited.  I need to decide if that's the course of action I want to take.  Unfortunately, in all of this I've sacrificed any chance of a relationship with my "contact" in Trumbull, who normally would definately be on the list of people I find attractive there.  But in recognition of the fact that if I didn't bring her into this there wouldn't be any Trumbull events, I decided that was what had to be done.  However, there are plenty more people.  Either choice seems to be a good option.  If I go for the friends, then I secure occasional activites such as tonight's till I graduate next year.  If I go for the girlfriend, if things go wrong, then I loose a lot of contact with the Trumbull people.  Sure, I will still attend activities with the few people I know now, but not with the same frequency as if I expanded my base of friends.  Having a girlfriend has other benefits, though.  It would be nice someone to "like" me for once.  Not that it hasn't happened before, but in one case I had absolutely no interest in the person (and I didn't learn about it for years after the fact). The other case happened in a situation where I think all parties were under mental duress, the location was not sutable for a relationship, and to this day I don't what to think of what happened, but it certantly doesn't count.  If it's any clue, the next chance you'll probably hear of it is in the book I'm writing (or should be writing, I need to get going!).  Anyway, I'm debating...

        Some people just don't get that there is more to a person than what they look like.     Other Person:  no but u see my point  Ross:  No I don't. Because you shop for girls like your at Circuit City buying TVs. You want the most expensive one, the thin one, the one that looks nice, that people will be impressed with when they visit you.  Other Person:  ahahahaha  Other Person:  thats exaACTLY it  Other Person:  o my god  Ross:  Thats sick.  Ross:  To you, they are nothing more than objects on a store shelf.  Other Person:  no  Ross:  And you just hope you have enough left on your credit card to bring one home.  Other Person:  ;-)  Ross:  That's how it is. It doesn't matter that they are nice people, that they have upstanding values. No, you want the one with the digital signal, the best picture, the one you can mount on your wall.  Ross:  People are not objects.  Other Person:  well i want more then a plasma tv. i want to know it intimatly  Ross:  Yea, you want to sit in front of it every night, staring at it's beauty, you want to take it in for all it's worth. The amazing technology.  Ross:  It doesn't matter what it says to you, what's on the screen, it's just that it's with you, in your own home. It's a status symbol and something to marvel at and you like it.

       Maybe it's just late and I'm in a negitive state of mind, but I don't think this whole Trumbull thing is going to be as easy as it seems.  Not impossible, just not easy either.  For me, the travel time is not an issue, but justifying why I'm trying to spend most of my time in Trumbull rather than Easton is going to be difficult.  Bridging the gap between online conversations and becoming good friends with these people is going to be a challenge.  I was just thinking of something that happened when I first visited the Trumbull people with my Easton contact.  One of them was my contact's ex-girlfriend, and she said to him with regard to their relationship, "Those were some of the best days of my life."  I thought to myself, "I really wish someone would say that to me sometime."  But it won't happen.  Not now.  Maybe in 6 months from now if this Trumbull thing works out, or maybe not for two more years.  I don't want a girlfriend, really.  That's not a primary goal of this venture, nor is it a secondary goal.  I want to meet people, I want to get away from the isolation of Easton, CT, the social groupings, I want to meet someone other than people I've gone to school with since Kindergarten.    People say a lot of things to me.  Today I went to a job in Newtown, and was just lathered with compliments from the guy I worked for about how smart I am, how I know what I'm doing, how great it is to work with me.  I get that all the time, save some of the big offices I work in where I do the work, leave a bill, and leave.  Everyone compliments my skills, my ability, my inteligence.  But that's not want I want.  Their check in my hand is a compliment enough, it means that I performed my work to their satisfaction.  I've devoted my time to helping people, possibly my life.  I spend every waking hour trying to reduce my impact on this planet, on the resources we all share, in hopes of improving the lives of society in general.  I choose to become an EMT because after all the excitement and the lights and the action, I'm helping people.  On the top requirements for a future job is the ability to help people, directly or indirectly, the ability to make a difference in one person's life or the lives of many.  Usually the most respect I get from my peers is the, "I can't believe you just said that" look after I told them to recycle their can or bottle in the cafeteria.  But I'm not supporting a popular position, I accept that.  But all I really want is for someone to say to me, "those were some of the best times of my life," to me.  That's all I'd like in return.  I won't doubt it will happen, I question when.  I question can I engineer enough social relations in a different town to allow myself to actually enjoy my last year of high school.  The answer to that remains to be seen.

       I'm trying to figure out if I moved the Blockbuster DVD I had in the back of my car or whether it was stolen while I was at the movies Friday.  In other news, one of the Trumbull people returned, so the remainder of my week might be a little more interesting than expected.  I have to get up and work tomorrow morning (10:00 job, which means I need to be up at 9, something I don't really want to do, but the client asked for the earliest possible time).  Not much going on here otherwise.

       I learned today that one of the two Trumbull contacts I had that was not on vaction has left for what would seem to be a week.  That puts everything on hold at the moment, which is frustating for both myself and my Easton contact who coordinates all of this.  Two out of the three gone: one in Spain (who knows how long they will be there) and one in some obscure town I cannot begin to pronounce.  I hate logistical things like this.  Anyway, this puts most of my social activites on hold for the next week, so I might as well schedule a lot of work.  I went to Circuit City today to buy a cordless phone for my 638-0734 line (my personal/business line) and a headset for the phone.  I saw a nice $15 cordless on the website, but by the time I walked out of the store I had a GE $50 all digital 5.8 Ghz cordless phone in my hand.  And a $30 headset.  I've almost talked my dad into switching 261-6846 (our "home" line) onto  urlLink Vonage .  Normally I could care less, except people still call me on 261 and it's frustrating not to have Caller ID (which is free under Vonage) and that my dad is always coming into my room to make phone calls on 638 because it's free.  Besides, I can use a lot more of Vonage's features on 261, like if someone calls for my dad, I can say, "Please hold while I transfer you to his cell phone."  Ah, the joys of VoIP.

       I told my dad that my computer is a Mac today.  He didn't seem to care much, though he was suprised.  I think it's because he doesn't realize that Mac OS runs on Apple computers exclusively...he still thinks I'm running on my old Athlon, just with a different OS...

       The situation below just reminded me of something:  My dad was planning on making the trip to Flordia he is now on much earlier in the year.  My mom had approached me about it once:  Mom: "Well, dad was thinking of going to Flordia on vacation." Me: "Wonderful! I could actually have some time here by myself. You him and Laura go. Besides, I have to stay here to do my hours at Danbury Hospital." Mom: "Well, Dad was worried about that, so he decided not to go." Me: "Worried about what?" Mom: "Well, that you might do things we don't approve of when we are gone." Me: "Like what? I don't go to parties, I don't do drugs, I'm not the type to go mailbox smashing, the only time I usually leave the place is to go to work and the post office." Mom: "Well, he was afraid that you might....that you might...[with horror in her voice]  drive on the highway. "  This took place, of course, before my dad locked himself out of his truck and I had to drive on the highway to bring his replacement keys down.  Suddenly, I was allowed to drive on the highway when I wanted.  Also, this:  Other Individual:  what you been up to? AMDFolding8000: I'm debating whether to listen to my dad (who just yelled at me to go to bed because he wants me up early to go somewhere) or to flaunt his authority and assert my independence by staying up later. I think I'm going for option 2. Other Individual: tell himt o worry about something else Other Individual: it's not a big deal really seeing as you could be say..doing drugs now  For 95% of the students I go to school with, if they left for four days, a huge party would be thrown.  Not me.  I respect my independence, my parents trust, and I don't do unreasonable things when they are away.  But they need to stop worrying about every little thing and relax, taking comfort in the fact that I don't throw parties, I don't get drunk, I don't do drugs and about the only thing I do that they don't approve of is exceed the speed limit.  They should consider themselves lucky.

       I went to see Spiderman 2 with two of my friends, it was a spur of the moment thing.  I neglected to inform my parents, who are 1,000 miles away of this.  Sure, if they are around I'd leave a note saying that I took a car and where I was, however I figured that if they were in a state hours away by plane that I didn't need to update them on my every move.  I was wrong.  They called my cell phone twice during the movie (which I put on vibrate thankfully) and according to the call records here, called the home phone twice and my personal line at least once.  I, being the responsible person I am, called them immediately after the movie was over.  My dad picked up, and demanded to know where I was.  I told him I had gone to see a movie with two of my friends.  "You told mom that you weren't going anywhere three hours ago." "I know, and right after I was invited to this.  I don't plan these things weeks in advance." "You should have called us to tell us where you were going!" "I'm not a convict!  I don't need to report my whereabouts every two hours!" "I know your not a convict, Ross."  He handed the phone to my mom.  She asked me how I was doing, and I explained where I had been.  "Well, we just get worried, it's night and all." "Well mom, I know that you thought that someone had invaded the house and kidnapped me and then horribly mutilated my body before dumping it in a trashcan somewhere.  I'm calling to tell you that's not the case." She paused for a minute.  "Well, alright.  Call us when you get home."  Besides, if I had been in an accident, what could these people have done?  They are hours away by plane, and if the airline's performance on the flight down was any indication, it would be a day before they would arrive back here.  Better to let them enjoy the rest of their vacation without worrying about me.

            As I walked around today, somewhat bored, I questioned why people don't recycle paper.  Are they lazy, do they not care, or is it simply a matter of education?  It's amazing how many people approach me to tell me that they do recycle paper.  Newspaper.  Most people don't know they can recycle anything else.  It tooks years for even myself to stumble across the program.  Nevertheless, I now collect and recycle paper, regular paper (along with junk mail, catalogs, and the like) for recycling at the Trumbull Transfer Station.  Paper makes up such a huge percentage of our trash, it would be unbelivable if more people began recycling it.       Even more important though, is for one to buy recycled products.  This provides demand for recycled products, reduces strain on natural resources, and increases the demand for marketable scrap, which makes recycling more profitable.  While I buy everything from binders to pens to lined paper in recycled form, all I ask others to do is buy 100% recycled copy paper from Staples.  Or just get it from me.  Sure, it costs $2.00 more than regular paper.  Big deal, you can afford it.  Nevertheless, support for such a simple task is lacking.   As for what I'll dub the "Trumbull Project" right now, things are making slow but steady progress.  Yesterday I had a conversation with an individual online about the feasability of getting to know Easton along with those outside of Easton.  They argued that I don't make enough effort to get to know people within my own town, and I argued that because everyone already knows each other, it's far more difficult to do anything in town than out of town.  All in all, it's a moot point, since they conceded that there was really no way to talk to people in town during the summer if I don't have their screen names.  And if this "project" works out the way I'm hoping, I won't be concerned with getting to know people within my own town.  At the moment, however, I have a more pressing issue:  I've eaten all the food in my house and I am starving for dinner.  And since I live in the middle of nowhere, finding something to eat is rather difficult.  So, I must get going and try and find some food...

       For those readers interested in investments, here is a bit of personal advice:  Watch Apple Computer, Inc (AAPL).  It's stock dropped today in after hours trading after the company announced that it would delay shipments of it's new iMac to Septermber, missing the back to school shopping season.  Likely the stock will drop more in trading tomorrow.  A perfect opportunity to buy.  What does Apple have to offer?  -In the next few days, Apple will announce that they have a solve 1 million songs through their iTunes music store.  Likely this will bring their stock up a bit for a short term gain, but not enough to make investing in it as a short term investment worthwhile.  -However, Apple has a solid share of the online music purchase industry, iTMS accounts for the great majority of the songs on the market (I forget the exact percentage, it's somewhere around 60-75%).  -While Apple basically breaks even on the store, Apple makes a tremendous amount on iPods, and the store substantially contributes to the sale of those devices.  -Apple's iPod has about 50% of the market share of digital music players.  No one else comes close.  -Apple has solid finances, no long term debt and has been steadily increasing their earnings.  Analysts expect another increase next quarter.  While some might argue that the lack of iMac sales (which accounts for 20% of their overall sales) will fiscally hurt the company, I disagree, arguing that it won't have a substantial impact.  Most are concerned that Apple will loose back-to-school sales, but the vast majority of students purchases Apple products for use in an educational enviroment purchase Powerbooks or iBooks, and therefore I think the lack of iMacs availible will be a relatively little problem.  -Between the company's increasing hold of the online music business and the prospect of a G5 iMac in September (which should increase the company's profits over the quarter, as the G5 is a far more powerful chip that consumers will be more apt to buy as opposed to the G4), along with Apple's resolution of iPod Mini availiblity issues this summer, Apple looks like a pretty good bet that I would buy an hold for about 3/4 of a year, and then revaluate the company's standing.

       I accomplished a lot today.  I cleared the tree (which took all of five minutes) and then embarked on cleaning my room (which, if you know my room, is a task that could take three people serveral days to do).  I was able to finish about 80% of it and I must have spent four or five hours on it.  I also made my semiannual trip to the Trumbull Transfer Station to drop off my recyclables (paper (all types, including magazines, softcover books, mail, and regular paper) and corrogated cardboard).  Everytime I go to the transfer station I try to figure out how I can get other people to recycle their paper.  Obviously, the big inconvience is driving to the transfer station, so I am always willing to pick up other's recyclables.  Still, however, I've had no takers.  I'm even willing to buy people some recycling containers to put their stuff in.  The issue is people just don't care, they don't care that paper makes up about 35-40% of the trash we throw away, and reducing that kind of trash volume can make one hell of a difference.  I'm still working on how to fix that...

       What a day.  All week I've been swamped with work, every day.  The fact that I work two days a week at my uncle's veterinary hospital doesn't help, but nevertheless, it's quite enjoyable work, and it's nice to do something other than computer consult once in a while.  The result, of course, is that my days in Easton are composed of several jobs per day, and a good deal of my time is spent managing my company.  Today I had large and very stressful network-the-office and install a VPN job, which reminded me of why I spent most of my savings on a Mac.  They work.  I'm going to have to go finish the job, which I'm not looking foward to, mainly because I'm going to have to grapple with Filemaker Server 5.5.  Then, I was inputing checks into Quickbooks (my accounting software) tonight and suddenly my Quickbooks data file because corrupted.  I had put off making a backup of the file for some time, and as a result, I spent an hour and a half manually keying in all of my financial records from May on.  After completing the task, I immediately make a backup of my Quickbooks file.  I'm not letting that happen again.  Tomorrow I've got a Windows system (of course, I never have to service the Macs) that needs a reformat and recovery (very common) and a job in Westport that requires absolutely no technical skill.  Sunday I'm going back to tackle part two of the VPN.  Not looking forward to that.  Most of my time this past week has been constant stress, but hopefully, I'll have some chance to relax and have fun in a week or two.

       Despite that fact that I had three jobs in completely different locatons today, I was having a pretty good day,  until I realized that my brand new, full color Verizon cell phone is missing.  I knew I brought it home yesterday (though might not have put it away) and I'm almost sure I didn't take it to work today (though I might have put it down somewhere in the house before I left).  I know I didn't have it enroute to my second job.  My mom looked for it for a good hour and it never turned up.  I would call it, but I didn't leave it on.  I always leave my cell phone on, all the time, but my dad's share plan ran out of minutes a week early, and so I kept it off as I couldn't use it except to make cell to cell calls.  I'd better find this phone, and I better find it soon, before my dad realizes it's missing.

        How to Recover a Hard Drive   From time to time, I take pictures of what I do on a daily basis so my readers can actually see a bit of what I do, as opposed to read my (many times boring) commentary about it.  Today, I've detailed a common task that I perform for clients, recovering data on a hard drive.  Very frequently I get calls where Windows has (inevinatebly) broken itself beyond repair, and the client doesn't want to invest the time and effort to bring the system to working order, as it's more cost effective to buy a completely new computer.  However, the client wants all of their data from the old system, and thus I have them remove the hard drive and I pick it up.  Now, there are two conventional, Microsoft-based approaches to hard drive recovery.  As usual with Microsoft-backed solutions, neither really work.  The first is to use the Windows CD to boot into the recovery console and/or MS-DOS mode and use MS DOS commands to copy the files to another drive.  Not only is this cumbersome and slow, but there are only two devices you can copy the data to: another hard drive (which few people have, and then you have to transplant that drive into the new system anyway), or a floppy disk (which is far too small for any reasonable recovery).  The second to to reload Windows to recover the files, but that involves time and cost that a client usually doesn't want to invest.  Other times, the hard drive is corrupted and it won't be read by Windows or MS DOS in the first place.  Therefore, I did some research and found a very convient and effective way to recover data off a drive for a client.  I have an operating system called Knoppix, which is boot-on-CD Linux.  In other words, I insert the CD into the computer, it reads it, and the operating system is loaded into RAM, all without touching the hard drive.  Luckily, Knoppix has been able to identify any device or configuration I've been able to throw at it so far, so aren't any hassles with drivers.  And Knoppix automatically mounts the hard drive, so I can access it through Linux.  After obtaining the hard drive, I first take my test/repair system off my shelf and connect the hard drive to it:           Once the system is turned on, Knoppix automatically boots and configures the system for use:       I then can access the contents of the hard drive and copy the needed files over the network to my Mac.  I could do this with a PC, but the Mac makes it much, much easier, since right out of the box it can act as an FTP server, so I can just FTP the contents of the drive over the network, and, with a good drive, I can get 8-10 MB/s of transfer this way.  Once the files are on the Mac, I just burn them to a CD or a DVD for the client, and return the CD along with the drive and an invoice for about a half hours worth of work ($20).

       Picture has been Photoshoped, then uploaded again, to address the concern the picture was too "busy."  The problem is that the image has a different aspect ratio and so it shows up rather distorted.  This will be fixed in the next few days, I've just got to find the right ration (the other picture seemed to be fine, so I'll base it off that).
