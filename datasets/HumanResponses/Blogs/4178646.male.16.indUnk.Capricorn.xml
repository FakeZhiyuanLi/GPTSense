      Gone for some fishing(luring) somewhere at marina there... once i reach there, saw a few grps of people doing baiting... haiz... feeling like no chance liao... but then, i decided to take out my lure and try it out...so i begin the session with soft rubber grub... cast and throw... due to the wind, i can cast far and therefore i decided to change into another lure... Chug bug... metallic blue.... cast and cast.... erm thinking that the splash is quite same due to the huge wave.... and the wave were quite strong... not like those beaches i gone to... water splashes up onto my legs.... then have the idea to change lure... Maria XJ 9cm white body and a little reddish dot on the head.... take the lure to another spot to cast... first cast noting happen... second cast... cool... felt someting tug onto the other end when the lure was about 2 to 3 metres away from me.. i tink that i may jus accidentally bump onto the floorbed and also have in mind that there was a fish... so i pulled... a fish jump up... donoe wat fish... silvery body... sharp teeth as it made quite a lot of small holes onto the lure... the fish could be quite strong as it has the force to penatrate the teeth into it.... ... a bit greenish onto of it if im not wrong....the sunlight shone onto the fish... cool... a beauty... heart pound fast as long time no fish on lure and also the first fish to bite it.... retrieve and cast again... again.... again.................... no effects.... go to the other spot... cast...noting... then go back again after 1 to 2 mins.... sec cast again... it pulled it and i also pull... arh nv hook it... haiz then retrieve a bit... then it tug again... but onli saw like one big bubble that makes those big ripple about 1 feet as the diametre before the fish was gone.... haiz then cast and cast no effect... change to skitter pop for fun as the sky was getting dark... pop pop.. noting hahahhaa.... then change back to maria again... noting... and then i call it a day liao... went back home empty handed but i also don intend to take back the fish as we are encourage to practice CNR hahaahha.... Wonder when can i get a fish on an artificial hard plastic lure....

      I accidentally placed my fishing lure tackle on the top of my dad's car while placing both my one piece 6 feet and two piece 6 feet 6 respectively into the car... it was too long for it to be placed in the car boot and thats y i have to place it in front... once i finished putting both rods in, i just get into the car and didint realised the box on top... and the car went on... two ladys happen to be near the car after the turn... they were pointing us but we do not noe it.. and we use carry on with the way... after a few turns, fortunately the box doesnt drop down or else i lose quite a lot on the money spend on those... near the junction, thankfully, a foreigner who was in the taxi call us by using hand signal and also he requested the driver to wind down the glass screen... he told me that i left my fishing tackles on the car top... while he was calling me, i am searching for where did i placed the box... i reaches my hand out to the top and search for the box... finally, i gotten hold of it and put it in a safe place... pewh.. thats close... or else it will lose its grip and fall off after the U turn... thanks to the so called 'angmoh' for telling me that... luckily he nv say toy... hahah.. in the box was some artificials lure... onli americans or japanese or anyone that has used or seen before, noe that...
