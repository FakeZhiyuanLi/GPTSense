      This morning T and I went to see an accountant to do our tax for the first time.  It makes me feel all kinda growed up to pay someone else to do our dirty 'life admin' work - like haveing out own secretary - yeah, our live are far too important and complex to worry about that stuff ourselves.  In my last years tax return (which I sent in last week), I managed to end up owing them 10 bucks.  I thought I could handle that - I'm on a decent wage and don't have any expenses to speak of... Wrong!  So the tax man was sitting behind his desk scribbling away and it reminded me a lot of that ad (I think it was for H&R Block or some such) with the accountant getting excited about numbers and saving you precious cents of your tax return.  Well he did, and reckons I'll be getting a cool two grand back from Mr Tax!  All very nice, but I still feel like a criminal somehow... hmmmm ... how was I cursed with this Catholic guilt when I was never brought up as one??  Must be a recessive gene.  ***  In other news... in line with the late bloomer theme that I have going, I took my rebelious phase to the next level and got my nose pierced.  In your face Big Evil Corporation!  I was gonna be all cool about it but then as I was sitting on the bench at Punktured, my nostril freshly perforated with a big metal needle by a funky multi-peirced dude, I exclaimed "Wow! I feel so much cooler now - seriously, about 20% cooler!".  How uncool is that.  Anyway, I'm trying my darnedest to not touch it and get it all infected - cos the only thing uncooler than my remark would be to be spewing pus out the hole I paid 60 bucks to have made in my face.

      2003-10-01 - 4:40 p.m.  The other day I was on my way home from work, wedged on a crowded tram while it drizzled outside - desperate to get far away from work as quickly as possible. Then my mobile rang. It was my friend asking a very BIG favour - could I get off the tram, head back into the city and pick up a VERY IMPORTANT comic book for him that the comic book guy had only four copies of, simply could not hold one of, and wouldn't be getting anymore in of.   I begrudgingly agreed. I caught the next tram back into the city and found said comic book store. I walked inside and saw the comic book guy. Now, here I would love to say that he looked just like the comic book guy from the Simpsons, but he didn't. He just looked like a slightly geeky-cool comic book fan, and really rather cute.   COMIC BOOK GUY: [before i have even opened my mouth]   Brad sent you, didn't he. [this was not a question]  ME: Err, yes. I hear you have Brad's package. [yes, said with heavy innuendo]  CBG: What is in the package?  ME: I don't know he just said you'd have it for him. [at this point i am beginning to get worried, surely i didn't make this trip for nothing]  CBG: How will I know you aren't working for someone else?  ME: [Oh Christ] I really don't care that much.  CBG: Hmmm. Alright then, I think I can trust you.  ME: Oh good. [trying to sound droll]  [CBG then proceeds to go to a shelf in the store where sits a HUGE PILE of Transformer comic books. He hands me one.]  CBG: That will be $10.50  ME: Are you serious? For this shitty little comic book? You must be joking! When I was a kid, the CFA drove around the streets at Christmas and Santa used to throw these things at us for free! [ok, no, I didn't say that. I just gave him the money.]  CGB: May the force be with you. [ok, no, he didn't say that either, but it would have been funny if he did.]   I got my own back when my friend called again and I told him they had sold out. He was ready to end it all there and then.    Sometimes I think they are from another planet.

      My previous post was to give some background to my homelife in order for me to give you some context when I tell you about the giganta-party we had on the weekend at our house.  We agreed to have my cousin's 21st party at our place and we understood that it would not be a small affair.  My cousin, S, has been in a relationship with one of my husband's best friends for a few years now - needless to say we are no longer in the vacinity of 21 ourselves.  This meant that S's friends and family decided that this was the 21st party the we would use to vicariously re-live our own 21st parties through.  There were nigh on 100 people, an unimaginable quanity of alcohol, copious cocktails and vicious vodka jelly shooters, pretentious hor d'ouvres (?), nostalgic PowerPoint montages, a well driven set of decks and insurmountable hijinks.  It had everything you would want for your 21st party  - imaginiave drinking games, ridiculous dancing, snogging and vomitting.  There was even a weird awkward thing with the birthday girl's mum's reunion with both her ex-husbands and their new families, yeeesh.  I'm just pretty damn impressed that we could pull this off in a house with a new baby - just shows they really don't have to stop your life, you can still be young and stupid and a parent.  Isn't life grand.

      Here's another archive.  My living situation has changed substantially from mine and my husband's St Kilda one-bedroom deco apartment and I think I should provide a little background.    I currently share a fantastic big old house with my husband, my younger brother, his girlfriend, their new baby, and our two cats.  My brother and his girlfriend were put in a bit of a sticky situation late last year (albeit one of their own doing) and our new living arrangements were a way of helping them deal with this situation (explained in post below).  My brother is finishing his last year as a student and his girlfriend has become a full-time mum, while my husband and I work.    Five months on and it was the best idea anyone's had in a long time.   We have an amazing house in a fabulous part of Melbourne, great company, cheaper bills and I get to see my new nephew every single day.  Life is good.  Please read on...  ***  I think we here in Australia, living in this period of history, are all spoiled for choice. That's why we (still, I think) call it the Lucky Country.  But are we ready for the amount of choice we are presented with today? I mean in an evolutionary sense; are we ready? I think there is more to the saying, 'spoiled for choice' than we give credit for.  It was merely 100 years ago that women did not have the choice to vote; 80 years ago that men did not have the choice not to go to war for their country; 50 years ago that we did not have the choice of what to watch on television or buy at the supermarket; and not more than 20 years ago we did not have the choice of when not to have children.  Our technological, medical and societal progression has led us to these choices. I think 'variety is the spice of life' has been the mantra providing the momentum for this progression. But what we have not considered in our blind scramble for infinite choice, is that we may not have progressed enough emotionally to deal with these choices.  The importance we give to choice being the essence to 'quality of life' is huge. It instills in us a notion that no second is to be wasted. We have pedestalised choice so highly that we are now compelled to fill our life with choice and try as many options as possible.  My brother and his girlfriend have just had one choice removed from them; an unusual situation in this day and age. She has discovered she is five months pregnant - too far gone for there to be a choice in the matter. Naturally, at their stage of life, this wouldn't be a choice they would make - indeed it is one they were actively discouraged to make.  Without this choice they have no option but to be excited and happy about their new circumstances. Had she have found out earlier in the pregnancy, they would have had the burden of choice resting on their shoulders - would their relationship last? would their careers be hindered? would they survive financially? would she survive the guilt if she chose not to continue the pregnancy? would she be able to concieve again if she chose to abort? Should she be making the choice for my brother as well?  This weight of choice is heavy enough to crush a person or a relationship. This freedom of choice can suffocate us and sap us of the basic instinct to make the best of any given situation. That human right has been taken away from us, we now bear the responsibility of our own choices, our own happiness.

       I've decided to publish a few of my old entries from a now defunct other blog.  It seems a shame to let them go to waste on that big trash heap that is abandoned web writing.  So here's the first:   what a great method of work avoidance!  whatever did we do in our jobs before the computer age?! work?? heaven forbid!  my confession: i have become a recent blog addict. i love discovering a new blog and reading all the archives. i am just working up to leaving comments - it takes a while cos you have to come up with a good pseudonym first...   I've been having a few issues with the pseudonym. in my mind, i've always been incredibly normal and envied those people who can define their personalities with tattoos, piercings, groovy haircuts and funky clothes. It's the same with pseudonyms - I can't find one that fits and describes my personality in a neat little package.  when i was setting up this blog, the username sarahsdiary was taken (surprise!) so i'm trying on soulstash - hopefully i will get comfortable wearing it and it will become a favorite in my wardrobe.   just to help things along, i'm not gonna tell anyone i know about this blog just yet, i'm hoping that this will allow me to say whatever i want.

      I'm dancing at Barbukka this Friday night (and possibly many Friday nights to come too).  I'm certainly not at a "payable" level yet, but I don't really care - just the opportunity to get up and perform in front of an audience is thrilling to me.  And slowly the nervousness I feel before a show is being replaced by excitement.  I'm still kind of at the shitscared stage of performance anxiety.  I really want to get to a point where I just can't wait to get dressed up and get out there and improvise a dance to a song I love.  I've only been doing belly dance for a year now and it's pretty cool to think that after such a short time I can do my own solo choreographies.  And it's also amazing to think that I have so far to go with this art.  I want to learn standing backbends to the floor, sword balancing, cane dances, candle dances, dancing with zils (finger cymbals), more veil dances and get more experienced with drum solos.  Wow, it can go forever. I have also started teaching my brothers girlfriend (and my housemate - that's another story I'll tell you later...) in our 'activities room', I have no idea how I am as a teacher, I still have heaps of work to do there, but I certainly feel like I'm on the way to becoming a better dancer.  It's a really good feeling to have an interest that I just can't get enough of and want to be completely immersed in AND have the opportunity to do it in front of people!   I'm feeling pretty good about my life at the moment...

      Well Yelza was nice.  Really nice.  Easy to miss on from the street, they have their windows all shaded up so you can't see inside - only a menu stuck behind the glass.  It was the menu that got me in there actually, I think I was lured by the thought of mushroom pie with truffle oil (appealing to a semi-vegetarian).  Turns out the menu in the window was defunct anyway (maybe it's just there for marketing purposes now, I don't know) and the dishes change every day now.  Which was ok, as the food was great - T had a big fat steak with a pile of the creamiest mash I think I've ever tasted and I had a mixed seafood grill (I said semi-vegetarian, I've been told pescatarian is the term but that sounds more like a religious denomination).  The meals were lovely and the surroundings were beautiful - lots of dark wood, red velvet and dim lighting. My only problem with the place was the lack of desserts.  None.  And I was really up for some rich chocolatey gorgeous thing.  Anyhoo, I'd certainly recommend it, even just for drinks.  ***  Friday night T had the night off the Espy again, which was nice, and we made the trek out to his Mum's place in Tecoma for a family dinner while his sister was back from London for a few days. T and I have been together so long I've seen his family change over the years - moving from a tightly-bonded group of four to living thousands of miles apart and rarely seeing each other.  All of a sudden, his oldest sister and husband (a couple who, when we were younger, modelled ourselves on) drift apart, now their separated and we don't know what's happening with them from one week to the next.  They all used to seem so close and the family dinners would be brimming with "yay us" family propaganda.  Now it takes a marriage or a death for them to get in the same room and relationships are falling apart with nothing said and no support.  Now I feel like the exist predominantly on hot air and I appreciate my family that doesn't hype itself up but just enjoys being together. I think I'm getting to that age where you start to see the baggage crystalising on those around you.  It's a scary thing to witness.

      Yeah, so this is not the first time I've tried blogging.  I'm sure there are plenty of people in the same boat - completely addicted to other people's blogs and wish you had the dicipline to keep one up yourself.  I've had several in the past and have gone through bouts of ranting from my desk at work.  But it has never lasted long.  I figure I wont tell anyone about this shot at it and then the only pressure I feel will be from me, the only one I write for will be me and the only one I have to defend my laziness to if I get slack, will be me.  It's worth another go anyway.  ***  Right now I am suffering withdrawals from school holidays - this means I don't have any belly dance classes for two weeks.  This is my obsession at the moment.  I have been taking classes for a year now and have recently started doing the odd solo performance (unpaid, of course) when the opportunity arises.  I'm getting such a kick out of it.  As a closet exhibitionist (a very conflicted breed - craves attention but tries to hide it and doesn't like making a scene), I'm getting a weird nervous thrill out of performing in front of people.  I'm hoping as I get more used to it, the thrill will be more prevalent than the nervousness, but all in good time I guess.  I've also got very little happening at work at the moment, so I'm indulging my obsession with ebay bids on belly dance jewellery and paraphernalia, reading belly dance sites and related blogs ad nauseum, planning routines and the beginner classes I'm going to teach to my friends at home.  I'm really getting quite boring in my one-track-mindedness and I sincerly apologise to my friends and family.  I'm also hoping that this obsession is long-standing, as most of my obsessions (as the term indicates) are often fleeting.  In other news, tonight I am taking my husband out for a celebratory dinner to congratulate him for his first big sale at his new job (account manager for a radio station), and also to celebrate the freeing up of his nights (he has been keeping his job at the Espy for extra cash and is now slowly surrendering his shifts).  I've decided on Yelza in Gertrude Street in Fitzroy, I will post a review tomorrow.

      Uuuggghh, what a weekend! Friday night was nice and easy - red wine at home with brother (M) and friend (C) punctuated with intermittent bursts of belly dance practice. Have found a couple of tracks on the Twin Peaks soundtrack that I'd like to do something to - slow and sexy!  Saturday T sprang it on me that the party we were to go down to Geelong for that night had a 'doctors and nurses' theme. From this piece of news a frantic opp-shop search for a nurses uniform ensued. Savers came up with the goods, but only in a size 16! We got down there and L with her magic overlocker saved the day, managing to transform my frump frock into a sizzling fantasy outfit!  Great party - T took his decks down and the hot tub was bubbling out the back. At some point in the night it seemed like a good idea to ingest some illicit substances (naturally, I don't fully recall how this came about). Now I haven't done such a thing for nigh on three years and this made me feel rather the newby (this involved non-stop dancing, paranoia that my nose ring would escape and over-consumption of water). Some girl was seriously trying to pash me and though I was curious and had promised myself to act on the impulse if the opportunity ever came up, she was frighteningly predatory in her approach and smelled of cigarettes (yuck). So I gave it a miss. When everyone had passed into blissful comas by 6am, I was lying wide awake with eyes darting.  So, with eyes falling out of my head and feeling like I'd been slowly run over by a semi-trailer, we drove back to Melbourne on Sunday morning in time for my workshop at the Melbourne Middle Eastern Dance Festival. Somehow I got through it and managed to take a few things away to ponder - as well as a nice new hip scarf purchased at the market to add to my ever-growing collection.  Suffice to say Sunday night and Monday night held no excitement for me but that which was sleep. Had S and B over for dinner last night - nearly converting them to vegetarianism with my delicious mushroom schnitzel followed by Nigella's brilliant chocolate pavlova [drool].    Oooh! Just realised all lovely new formatting options in blogger toolbar!
