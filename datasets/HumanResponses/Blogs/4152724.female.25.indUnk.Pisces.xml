      AGH!!! Why do people have to do drugs? I just don't understand. Ok we have another kid in and this time for possession of cds. She's asking us a million questions and we don't know the answers to. I'm sitting here listening to this girl talking to my partner and he's trying to calm her down by answering her questions. Ok I've been here almost thirty minutes and she is already bugging along with my partner. Please people be quiet. I'm thinking please stop talking to her and making her worse and let her sleep. Please girl go to sleep.

      Well I'm back at work and really didn't want to come today. The kid we had in lastnight  finally left this morning. I'm just sitting here at being bored yet again. My partner is watching the news on t.v. I'm hoping he doesn't bug me today. Tonight is the first scrimmage for football, so hopefully the kids will be good. School starts Thursday so this weekend is the last before school starts. Jason's aunt and uncle head back to San Antonio tomorrow morning. I got to see them Wednesday evening. Man I really don't have much to say makes me seems pretty boring lol. Guess I'll surf the net and some message boards, and maybe write some more later if I can think of anything to say lol.

      Geez this is really bugging me, my partner that is. So we have a kid in and he's here sitting in the room with me bugging me. Can't he take the hint that I'm not listening to him. I'm on the computer trying to stay entertained and not pay attention to him? He was asking stupid questions again to coworkers agh!!!! Man does he ever make me look stupid in front of people. Don't get me wrong he's a nice guy but man oh man does he ever bug me. I'd better end before I get too worked up about this lol.

      OMG my partner at work is driving me crazy! Why can't he be normal? Why does he ask me such stupid questions? Why does he freak whne the word"juvenile" is mentioned on the radio? AGH!!!!!!!!!!! I keep thinking to myself it'll be ok. It's pretty bad when ShaClair and Jason want out of here so fast, but yet I have to work the whole eight hours with him. I don't dare ask him something or it'll end up in an half to hour long speech. Sometimes I don't understand why people are the way they are. I'm not trying to judge but is he really that ignorant? When I work with him I feel way cool and normal, but if he goes and asks an officer or another employee a question it makes me look dumb. He asks the most stupidist questions. HELP!!!!!!!! I'll update in a bit more on the day.

      Today went pretty well. Jason and I went to give blood. We came back and I took a nap. Guess I was tired cause I slept for a couple of hours. I called my parents earlier this evening, then Jason and I went for a drive around town. I love driving in the summer evenings with the windows down. Today is over already and went by too fast. Well I have one more day off work, just hoping tha it goes by slow.  I played around with a recent pic of mine and here it is.  urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v135/stangladyok/melissapic.jpg

        Today went pretty well. I went to work out and tan. Came home got ready for work and then went to work. No kids in today just have my annoying partner bugging me. I'm so looking forward to get off work. Jason is still waiting for my brother to ask him to film is wedding. He doesn't mind doing it but John needs to ask him. I can't believe that he's getting married October. Here it is mid August already. Where has this year gone? Jason having alot of fun film the church sermons I hope this gets him somewhere. He's still taking his college course. I'm still debating on if I should go into counseling or not. Jason and I are going to give blood on Monday. The blood institute called me this afternoon, asking if I'd give blood. I volunteered Jason lol. They said that by giving blood our name gets in a drawing for a cruise for two to the Carribean. I'd so love to go since Jason and I really didn't go anywhere special for our honeymoon. I'm crossing my fingers that our name gets picked. I'm working by myself on Sunday and Monday due to my partner Kenneth taking off for leave for my mother-in-law's funeral. I mind working by myself as long as I don't get too busy. Please be quiet those two days. I 'd hate to call someone else in. Well not too much going on today except I'm bored, and still having another hour to go.

       Well today went pretty well. I have one more day off then I head back to work. I go to mom's tomorrow to spend some time with her before Jason gets off work.  Jason and I went for a drive this evening but had a june fly in and had him pull over and kill it lol. I went to work out today and I felt alot better. I'm gonna get back into shape. I think with my job and all I do is sit all day sure doesn't help, so no wonder I've gained some weight. I think that combined with taking the pill made me gain. Well i stopped taking the pill about two months ago so that should help me loose. Well I'd better get some rest before it gets too late cause tomorrow is gonna be yet another fast yet busy day.

      YAH!!! Today is my Friday!! I only have forty more minutes then I'm off for two days.  I can't wait to leave my partner at work is nice and all but man does he ever drive me CRAZY!!! I get to spend tomorrow with Jason. Then on Wednesday I get to spend the morning and part of the afternoon with my mom. I'm gonna try to swing by my parents house tomorrow to scan off some of my pictures, so I should have some more pictures on my website here soon. I really need to cut the grass but it looks like it might rain tomorrow so I'll see. I gotta clean house, do laundry, and go to the store tomorrow. Maybe Jason will help me out around the house lol. Well I'm just hoping that my days off go by slow cause I only got one day off last week due to having to go to that mental health class. It was alright but the audio on the videos was terrible, at least I got overtime for going. I talked to my dad last night and it seems that my sister-in-law Gina got to get off the shots. It seems her pregnancy is going well. I can't wait to be an aunt. Jason keeps telling me that he wants a baby. I do too but it doesn't seem like the right time now. I know they say that if you wait for it to be the right time, that it never happens lol. In time we'll start a family. When it happens it happens. I just know that my parents are very supportive of our decisions. I know that they would want nothing more than to have a grandchild, but they will in January with Gina's pregnancy. It'll be our time someday and when I don't know.

        I really miss not being able to spend more time with my family. Since I've been married I've gotten closer to both my mom and dad. It's weird how living out on my own can change my life and has made me mature more. I look at things so much differently. I cherish the moments I get to spend with my husband which are rather slim these days. I'm just thankful for having a loving family and husband. It's a shame that work has to get in the way of things you enjoy most. I try not to think too much on this but here lately all I've been thinking about is wanting to see my family more. Since I've been married it's like all I do is work but I gotta work. Maybe something good will come along soon. All I can do is keep praying to God and hope that it happens soon. I'm so proud of Jason he tries his hardest to be a good video editor. The way he's grown toward God makes me really look up to him. I know it sounds crazy but I really admire my husband. He stands up for what he believes in and has made me grow even closer to God.

        Man all I've been doing here lately is griping about juveniles. There are too many in this town that get arrested. Parents half the time don't want to pick them up or try to leave them here for punishment. This is really bugging me don't parents know that they can punish them at home? They seem to think we can hold them up to twenty-four hours which not true. I have to tell them time and time again that our policy states that we are to get placement for these kids ASAP. We have problems with a boys home in town not picking their AWOL's up in a decent time when they are only a block away. DHS half the time don't know what they are doing as far as placing their kids. County Juvenile seems to be the only ones to get things done.  It just doesn't seem like the system cares about these kids. I thought they are there to help but seeing this side doesn't seem that way at all. One thing I can say about my job is that it makes me thankful for the family I have.

      AHG!! Today at work sucked we had four juveniles come in the last few hours of work. I usually don't mind them in but I absolutely hate it when we get drunks in. Well what do you know we had a drunk in and he was not very coherent at all. I totally freak out worrying that they might vomit. I cannot stand being in a room with someone who's throwing up. I just hope and pray that they either make it to the bathroom or toilet in time. Thank God that school is going to start in about three weeks. There sure has been alot of drunks in lately. Well I'm just started this blog and I'll see how it goes.
