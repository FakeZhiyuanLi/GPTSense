						   It's strange how life so often (always?) gives you what you need, when you need it. Of course, sometimes it takes a practised eye to see this for what it is...  In recent weeks, entirely separately, I have had renewed contact with friends from several different quarters, from Joe LaRose, from Hence the Smiley aka dpd here on the blog, from my former cow-orker Nathalie P, and these have all served to revitalise me somehow, I'm feeling fresher and freer, and I can't say it's unwelcome.   I have a birthday upcoming, part of which will entail a piece of new equipment for my studio. Historically such an event has been a good time to rediscover recording; for example, awhile after finishing the 3rd album, I purchased some new equipment, and driven by the need to experiment with it, wrote and recorded Derelict Café and Endless, which broke the creative blockage, and led immediately into the recording of the 4th album, my freest and most realised work to that date. Perhaps this experience may repeat itself.   Part of my clear problem is logistical -- in my current lifestyle, I have little chance to pick up and play musical instruments, meaning that (a) my playing has atrophied quite a bit, and (b) I am not providing myself with the  opportunity  to encounter/receive musical inspiration. After all, the muse cannot communicate through you if you do not place yourself at its disposal to begin with. This is out of balance, for me, and must be redressed.  Ever forward. I'm at least feeling lighter and more positive than when I started this blog.

						   My goodness. Hence the Smiley.   I won't go into too much detail here in response to all of what you say, but (perhaps to my own surprise) I would welcome a correspondence with you if you want to  urlLink e-mail me privately . There have been so many times over the last many years that I have thought about speaking with you, just because there were books, movies, musics that I would have wanted to discuss with you.   I do want to respond here to a couple of things you say, though, because they are relevant to the public self-evaluation I embarked on when I started this weblog. I must say, it never really crossed my mind that ANYONE would be reading this, much less that I took the chance of falling back into contact with someone from my past.   Firstly, I want to thank you for your very kind and encouraging words about my music. I am honestly stunned by the feelings you express for the work I have done, and it does mean an incredible lot to me. I don't know anything about being a musical "genius." I have been fortunate several times in my life to have been granted that amazing direct-feed inspiration from the muse, and have at many of those times been up to discharging it honourably. I suppose that, if genius is the ability to tap into that creative source and then not overly obstruct it with ego, I have at least experienced moments  of  genius, only because I have been present for the coming into being of works of art that, afterwards, have filled me with awe rather than pride, more a witness to and vehicle for the event, than its actual originator. Right now such experiences seem long distant to me. That does not rule out having future experiences that rival, or even surpass, them. But, for the moment, there's "nothing there."  Secondly, you speak about forgiveness, and as you have read, a lot of what I'm currently exploring with myself revolves around this issue. I want to say that there are no people, aside from myself, with whom I have forgiveness issues. And in fact, there was never anything in you for me to forgive. After all, it was not anger, but fear, that led to me distance myself from our relationship; not a lack of forgiveness, but a lack of trust. (Rightly or wrongly, or both-ly.) I was never in any doubt that you were in as much emotional turmoil as I was, back then -- I suspect you were in more. I have no doubts that you have grown and changed a great deal since last we spoke -- 8+ years is a long time. I have grown and changed immeasurably in that time. (And yet, as you have seen from my blog entries, I still wrestle with some of the same issues that troubled me back then.)   I hope to hear from you via e-mail. Thanks again for your comments. I really am happy to hear from you.  Love never changes.

						   Fewer heavy feelings, last couple of days, although no real answers.&nbsp; Sometimes it's asking the questions that matters.  &nbsp;  Letting Go is a process to which I give a lot of thought. Possibly one of the most important skills one can obtain, yet also among the most difficult.&nbsp;Letting go of expectations. Letting go of self-recrimination. When you can't let go, the load gets heavier and heavier, until it becomes impossible to move on.  &nbsp;  I still plague myself with mental replays of poor moments from my past, moments when I embarrassed myself or otherwise let myself down with my behaviour before others. Most, if not all, of these moments are trivial and insignificant, the kinds of things that I can't imagine the others present even  remembering  now. But  I  remember them, and remembering them fills me with a feeling I get no place else, a kind of hatred and rage that no other thought or experience produces in me. It feels like a hatred of life initially, although I don't hate life, my life is blessed in many ways. I hate the people who were present to observe my lapse. But really, of course, I don't hate them at all. I hate myself for being the person who could so humiliate himself. These moments date back as far as I can remember, and despite how much I grow and change, I still manage to produce more of them. Sometimes I despair, and think (even say out loud), "I should just keep out of situations where I have to be around people." I have worked so hard for the last 18 years, to try to overcome the preceding 21 and become whole and healthy. And progress I've made. And yet often I come around the corner and recognise myself, still as screwed up as ever, and incapable of consistent dealings with my fellow beings.  &nbsp;  Letting Go would seem to be the key here. How can I carry the burden of these things I did ages ago. I cannot go back and change them, and (in nearly all cases) they are circumstances that harmed only myself, and not others.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Wow, I started by saying "fewer heavy feelings," and now it's all this! Blog off!

						   Encouaraging words from my good friend Joe regarding my musical doldrums. Based on his own experience, he advises me not to worry about dry spells like this, he finds that "it doesn’t mean that you will never feel like making music again.  Quite the contrary, it is a way of preparing you for a new growth." I am heartened by this sound insight, and will open myself to this experience of non-arriving.  In other quarters, what does it mean to love someone, or how do we show this love, in cases where we are not in accord? When a loved one is self-destructive, say addicted to drugs or alcohol in a clearly damaging way: Do we show love by accepting the behaviour because it is what they choose to do? Or by counselling them to escape this pattern of behaviour, as best we can? If we do the latter, are we guilty of trying to control them, to make decisions for them? Is there another path that I have not considered? These are hard matters.

						   After being a musician for over 30 years, taking it seriously for at least 22, and being a genuinely worthwhile (imho) songwriter for 17+ years, I find myself in recent months somehow "cut off" from music.   This isn't writer's block, I've had writer's block. This is something different, and its roots may be somewhere I don't know yet or understand. Every instrument, including my own voice, is lifeless and unresponsive to me. I am, at this time, and for the first time since well before I knew enough to recognise these qualities, neither vessel nor vehicle for the muse.   This both pains and confuses me.

						   I suppose the fully unencumbered, "free" artist just follows the spark of inspiration, without a thought for audience, without an eye towards derivative influences -- just creates.  Or do they?  Have I ever done this?  My work, at least the best of it, feels like I was indeed in that space  during the actual moments of creation . But egad, do I do my own head in during the in-between times!  I Catch-22 myself with too much thought. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. If my ideas don't sound like someone else I admire, I think they must be poor and won't appeal to anyone. When they DO sound like someone else, I think they must be overly derivative and "people" will think I'm ripping someone off.  Because of this conflict, I have in some ways tried to find methods for skirting full responsibility -- for example, the unusual method by which my wife Cat "produced", by selecting one instrument at time, my fourth album; or even moreso, with the Virgin Twin album  Sacred Precinct,  where Jon-Ross provided all of the music for me to then lyricise/melodicise. The results from these experiments have been outstanding, the VT album being indeed the highpoint of my entire creative output, solo or colloborative.   Yet I always gravitate back to this yearning desire to create freely from myself. Not to "go solo" instead of collaborate -- I have hope and intention for Virgin Twin to carry on approximately forever -- but to BE ABLE to reach that place again, without imposing contrived "freeing mechanisms" like those named above.  Truth be told, I have no shortage of ideas. In fact, there are four fully composed songs, sitting in my brainvault for the last, ohmygod is it really 6 years plus!? But fear has kept me from doing anything with them. Fear that they won't appeal to anyone else, fear that my musicianship is no longer up to delivering anything. There are obviously also the logistical problems I have alluded to in previous posts, but truth is, the logistics are more of an excuse than anything else -- that is, there is truth to the fact that recording is currently more logistically difficult than in previous years, but the "other" truth I try to avoid is that, back in the days when I was creating freely, I would never have allowed these same logistical difficulties to stand in my way.  The clear answer should be, is, must be: If I have ideas, make them so. The best of what I can do will only come if I clear my mind of other concerns and allow it to come through me. Even if for some reason I  do  end up disappointed with the result, better to end up disappointed with something that was True for me in the moment, than with something I tainted and manipulated in favour of superficial concerns.

						   Last night, finally had the opportunity to chat on-line with great friend and musical partner Jon-Ross, for the first time in ages! Discussed with him in detail the contents of the Blog, and he offered much support.  Through the course of the conversation, in explaining myself and found I also explored the issue further, and came up with the following, paraphrased from my log of the IM chat last night:    By the way, I'm not depressed, just to be sure you know. You can probably tell.  But Here and This is something I think I have to go through.   It  has  to be a positive thing because, unless I despair, which I don't, it can't possibly be a negative thing.  There's someplace I've always meant to get, and whatever's always held me back is what I'm pushing against now. This recent/current situation is the whole thing finally coming to a head.  I can no longer tap into my creative self unless I push through this barrier. So it's give up, or push on it. (And figure out the right WAY to push on it.)  I don't know when I'm next going to be productive with music, nor what I will produce when I am. But at this point, I've not given up on the idea. In fact, if I couldn't feel it calling me I wouldn't even be working on getting there.  While I'm on one hand optimistic and forward-looking about music, I don't actually know beyond a doubt that I will ever play an instrument or sing or perform again. I have made no decision NOT to, but they are currently foreign experiences.  I hope to find my way back to music more than I've probably hoped for anything. But at the same time, I can't  force  it to happen, I have to find, again, WHERE it happens.

						   ...is that we lose the belief that we "know" what's right.  At one time when making music, let's say especially for the 1987 Year of Miracles, I simply knew (or believed in) exactly what I was doing. The first two albums reflect that in their clarity and unity. The three albums that followed them, while they contain individual pieces of work that are superior to anything on those records, overall do not cohere in the same way, because I was in the straits of self-doubt for most of it. I managed, during actual creative moments, to still allow the flow of inspiration more often than not, so the actual work still came through, but the fact that, in between sessions, I lacked confident self-belief, undermined the available momentum, kept the albums from fully taking flight.   I begin to see now how, even though I was back then quite deliberately creating only for myself, I was still in some way creating for some imagined audience, and gauging things by how I thought this hypothetical body might respond. During the first two albums I was so caught up in the newborn flood of inspiration that I didn't give it a thought, but following them -- and probably to some degree  because  of them, because of how successful I felt they'd been artistically -- I began to feel I had something to live up to in this imaginary, nonexistent audience's eyes.  I am now at a strange and different phase, one where it's begun to sink in that I may never  have  an audience, and I'm left uncertain as to where my motivation and focus come from. I find that perhaps this is even the crux of the creative ups and downs I've experienced post-1987: That due to self-imposed pressures, I lost touch, largely, with the part of me that was inspired to create for the sake of the creative experience, and became mainly focused on the outward appearance of creativity and productivity. Considering that this has been in the main my driving force for the last many years, it's actually profoundly surprising that I have been able to create some works of the quality that I have, because the need to appear productive is a pretty poor foundation for inspiration.  So now, here I am. Am I still inspired? Am I  driven  to make music? That is, does it come to me unbidden and politely demand to be given voice (as it once did)? Or do I just think about making music nowadays to avoid feeling like I've gone nowhere and done nothing?  We shall see.

      I can't believe that the best alternative that American can muster to George W Bush is John Kerry! I mean, I'm sure there must be better people for the job than either of these guys! How can Bush be president!? How can they have come up with an opponent that I don't strongly prefer to Bush!?   I just don't get it. America has all this potential, all these smart, intelligent, educated people, and yet somehow the only two candidates with a hope of being elected are George W Bush and John Kerry!  I'm not much of one for predicting the future, but I'd say it's a done deal that we'll have a rubbish president come November!  Yeesh.
