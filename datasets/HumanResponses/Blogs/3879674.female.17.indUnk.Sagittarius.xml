      This post will be a lil bit different from the rest. Wanna share more about d new frenz and d lecturers in college.       Ok... English class teacher is Ms. Romona Tsao. She's from Hong Kong, but grew up in Canada. She's a relli cool and funky(esp in the CIMP movie when she wore that wig.) I like her style of teaching and also enjoy the word scrambles she makes us do bcoz it makes English fun to learn.       Then there's Ms. Paule Rodrigue, a Canadian lady who can speak relli good French. She's learnt many malay words quite fast.(she likes banana cake too) She's a dedicated teacher, and i alwayz look forward to going to her class.       Ms. Sumathy is my accounting teacher. She's a malaysian and has been teaching accounting in Sunway since January 2003. She's understanding, and doesn't scold us for making mistakes and she always helps any student who don't realli understand the work.      Last but not least, Ms. Lana Sigurdson is my International Business Teacher. She's from Canada. She's the funniest teacher I've ever met. I don't ever think I'll fall asleep in her class...she's just got her unique "style" of teaching. She's so so super nice that she always apologizes for giving us homework.(How can we ever get angry with such a nice and funny teacher like her??)      Enough about teachers...lets talk about my frenz... Firstly, there are so many of them, so i'll talk about the people i hangout with the most. There's Jung Wei, Errol, Jimmy, Calie, Fangru and Vivi. Jung Wei's nickname is the "mouse" coz when he smiles, his eyes are so small..and some how he gives the impression of a cheeky mouse. Errol is from PD and he lives at the hostel apartment. He's a super nice guy and has relli good writing skills. Only thing is he has this "weird" eye problem, so he has to always sit in front in class. JImmy...will be an excellent salesperson..he's got good talkin skills and he's a joker too. Calie is from Ipoh...haha.. she's a humourous person. Talk to her, and you'll laugh at the gossip she tells you. She's always disturbing two of our teachers... (i won't mention who 4 privacy reasons) Then there's Fangru, a girl from Johor..she's sweet and pleasant, and also relli helpful. Vivi is a girl from Medan, Indonesia. SHe's a book worm..and has harry potter books in 3 different languages : English, mandarin, and Bahasa Indonesia. There's many other frenz such Farrah, Saremilla, PAmela, Hock Chuen, Thomas, Stella Jane, Tzer-Kai, Roderrick, JErry, Kevin, MIng Kuang, Li-Chen, Shahin, Alireza, Carina, Mini, Sandee and so many others all from different countries such as Indonesia, China, and Iran...but i'll tell more about them maybe in the next post.
