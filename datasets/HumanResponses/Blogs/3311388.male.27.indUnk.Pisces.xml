      Lately it seems that the internet is headed in two basic directions. One, as my uber-1337 friends would say, is t3h pr0n.  The other is online music stores, aka music services.  There are a billion other uses, gaming, research, chronic time wasting, etc. but essentially, these are the two main tangents things seem to swing toward. Microsoft hasn't gotten into the porn business yet, but you can bet your sweet bippy (yes, I actually DID use a 60 year old phrase, you smirking assmonkey) that they're headed into music downloads.  In fact, it seems like everyone is opening a 'music store.'  Apple, Wal*Mart, and seventy-five other companies who, as is typical for most large companies, don't have the slightest inclination that the internet has opened a can of worms that their nice little Rights-Managed stores can't jam the lid down on.    Here's the secret. The term Rights Management is an oxymoron. Of course, so is an idiot with pimples, but that's beside the point. The fact of the matter is that you can not MANAGE rights. You can grant them or deny them, propose them or defend them, but you can not MANAGE them because at that point, rights become privileges.  On another note...  Do bands/singers/musicians/artists deserve to get paid for their work? Sure. If it's priced reasonably and offers sufficient value.  In todays internet society, the trend is toward subscription that, license this, DRM that, and fees are increasing all the time.  All the while, the quality of modern music is abysmal, and sinking like a Gotti victim in the Hudson River.    The music industry has no concept of this. They feel that pushing their prefabricated, often regurgitated, and quite frankly shitty product on us at ever increasing prices is not only fair, but then they proceed to prosecute us when we decide to seek alternative distribution channels for what little good music is actually available.   Think about this for a minute you corporate soulsuckers.  Not everyone makes six figures and can afford to SUBSCRIBE to their favorite SONGS.  As long as MP3s and shitty bands exist, the demand for prerecorded media will continue to sink.  Here's a thought...how about you sign good artists, give them fair contracts that pay them well without overly fattening your Versace pockets, and then sell the music at a lower price. Even...gasp...consider adding real extra content. Not those stupid shitty b-side singles or bonus DVDs that just get ripped and posted on the net.  How about inserting random concert tickets...random autographed copies...coupons or certificates for merchandise that (here's the kicker: give the band free advertising)...REAL content that connects the artist and the fans.  In the grand scheme of things it would probably cost less than pressing a stupid 5 minute DVD with 6 versions of the song and a video, and I can tell you that I for one would actually be MUCH more inclined to buy music rather than download it if I actually got more for my 17 bucks than 2 good songs and 45 minutes of filler noise.  Just think about it.

      MEXICO CITY â€” Mexican air force (search) pilots filmed 11 bright, rapidly moving objects in the skies that an expert said proved the existence of UFOs, but defense officials said Wednesday no conclusions had been reached about the objects' origins.   A videotape aired Monday on national television showed a series of brilliant objects flying at more than 11,480 feet over southern Campeche state (search). The tape was filmed March 5 by air force pilots using a video camera equipped with an infrared lens.   The objects appear to accelerate rapidly and change course suddenly. At least one crew member testified in a videotaped interview that the objects encircled the military jet at a distance of at least two miles.   The pilots spotted the objects while conducting a routine drug-surveillance mission. Only three of the objects showed up on the plane's radar.   Infrared equipment can only detect heat emanating from objects. It is unable to provide an image of the objects' exact forms.   Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Vega Garcia gave the videotape to UFO specialist Jaime Maussan (search), who has spent 10 years studying unidentified flying objects.   Maussan claimed Tuesday the videotape was evidence that flying saucers exist. The video was especially significant since it was provided by the military, he said.   "This is historic news," Maussan said. "Hundreds of videos [of UFOs] exist, but none had the backing of the armed forces of any country. ... The armed forces don't perpetuate frauds."   But Vega denied Wednesday that the military had made any conclusions about where the lights came from or whether they were UFOs.   "This is Maussan's point of view, for that reason he was given [the video] so that he could draw his own conclusions," Vega told W Radio. "But that is his version."   Vega said he decided to release the videotape to the scientific community for study after determining it did not pose a threat to national security.   Vega also insisted that the military had not released the tape to distract the nation from other issues, such as a political corruption scandal, as some news commentators suggested.   Vega said he initially believed the objects were drug trafficking planes, "but when I began to see that they had those lights ... I realized they couldn't be such aircraft."   The defense chief said he had warned those under his command to refrain from talking about "flying saucers" and UFOs when discussing the video "because that just provokes doubts and jokes."

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Militants Behead American Hostage in Iraq   This whole situation has gone horrifically awry.  Exactly how do these terrorist pricks think they're entitled to avenge anything? Let's sit back and take stock of the situation here. I'm not going to get into US foreign policy or anything of the sort. As far as I'm concerned, our foreign policy can not and does not in and of itself CAUSE anything.  Did our foreign policy come to life one day and go bitchslap Fahim Abdel Rhamananananananananan somewhere in Afghanistan? No.   What happened was a bunch of middle eastern geniuses decided one day that it would be really cool, and totally kosher with "Allah" to just go kill a lot of Americans. Foreign policy was as good as any reason they could come up with, and couple that with the name of "Allah" and there you go. Just add hatred and stir. Let sit for a few minutes and you have cup-o-Jihad.    We are all familiar with September 11, 2001, so I'm not going to retell that story.   Needless to say, however, the US and most of the world were more than a little bit pissed off. Bin Laden's 'foreign policy' DID reach out and slap us, and we were more than justified in coming over to his house and playing some hardball in his backyard. Not too many people bitched and whined about that.  Except the Taliban, but they're mostly dead anyway, so who really cares?  So, then we went into Iraq. All of the sudden, the protests started. From campuses and coffeeshops across this great land, a chorus of anti-war chants rang out like pacifist non-lethal gunshots.  Whether it be WMD, spreading democracy, personal grudge, or what have you, we went in, kicked some ass, and dragged Saddam out of a hole like the grubby wormlike scumbag he is. Celebrations abounded, iraqis danced with glee. Well, most of them.    Now we have the big 'prisoner abuse scandal.' Oh my GOD. How dare we pose Iraqis in mock sexual positions. What's next? Dogs and cats living under the same roof? It's the end of the world I tell you!  As several others have said recently, maybe we should treat them like they treat us. Shoot them on sight and drag their flaming bodies through the streets, while we beat their charbroiled corpses with our combat boots.  But we won't do that. Why? Because we're not like them. So we experimented with some life-sized middle-eastern GI Abdul figures.  Even made a few of them demonstrate their kung-fu action grip while a chuckling grunt snapped a few polaroids. The worst damage we've done is some of the Freudian variety. Get over it.

      My web hosting company is gay. Not gay like the Queer Eye guys (and I use the term guys only in the strictest anatomical sense) but gay like Christopher Lowell at a poodle show.  Why is byzhosting gay you ask? Well, primarily because instead of automatically renewing my hosting, I have to manually pay them every month. That would be ok, only for some reason every time I go to pay them either their server times out or it refuses to accept my valid credit card. So I have to use paypal. That alone is gay. On top of all this homosexual revelry, I got my invoice for this month yesterday, went to pay it today and my account is suspended. Gayness rules the day. Ugh.

      My 5 month old son, Jack, has an ear infection.  What's worse is the 'cold' that comes along with it, and the fact that his little ear starts hurting him at random and he just screams like there's no tomorrow.    I've never seen anything that broke my heart as much as the way he screamed when his grandfather was holding him last night. All was fine for a long while, and then he just let loose with this blood-chilling scream that came out with so much force his little cheeks turned bright red and his head shook.    I would do anything to take his pain away. Sure, I'm giving him medicine and such, but it just doesn't seem like enough.    He went to bed like a champ last night though, around 10:30pm, and he's still out like a light. What a sweet little guy. I hope his fever breaks and he feels better today.

      Due to circumstances, my wife and I had to take our beloved cats, Comet and Vader to her parents house to live for a while. Her parents refused to let them in the house however, forcing them to stay in the garage, which is kept perpetually open.  This would not be so bad except for the fact that these little guys have ALWAYS been indoor cats and have no idea how to live outdoors.    Comet has taken up residence in the detached garage, and periodically peeks out distrustfully at all comers.    Vader, on the other hand, snuck off one night when no one was looking. Comet has been mewing heart-wrenchingly since, looking for his lost brother.  This post is to Vader, a special little guy who was a really sweet cat and a great friend.  I know he's a cat, and can't read, and most likely can't get on the internet, but I don't care. I want him to know what I have to say:  Vader,  My sweet little kitty.  What can I say old man? I still remember the day we got you two years ago when you were small enough to fit in my hand. And I already miss the huge cat you became with your super-long tail and beautiful green eyes.   I miss how you crawled up on me when I lay down and curled up on my chest...or slept between my feet.  You were always at my side, even when I didn't want you to be at the time. (Bathroom ring a bell?)  I miss hearing you scratch at the door to whatever room I was in. I miss you rubbing against my ankles, and I miss you flopping on your back so I could rub your tummy.   It's not the same without you pal.  I can tell Comet is miserable too. He's been looking for you since you left.   I'd give anything for you to come back...if I could just hear your scratches once more.  In case you've found a new home...in case you've struck out on your own...wherever you are, as long as I live, I'll remember you friend.   I love you little guy.  -Meowddy

      I hate cliches, but it's true. Just a dark, stormy, dreary night.  I'm a little upset about that since Kelly and I didn't get to go on our usual nightly walk tonight.  That's what tomorrow is for I suppose.   I hate the night anymore. All the demons in my head come out and play in the dark and it drives me insane.  I hate going to bed, and hate being awake.  I know why, and how to fix it, and I am trying.  Until then, I suppose I'll have to fight off the demons the best I can.

      Kelly's parents cleaned out the garage Comet (Vader's brother) was staying in.  Comet hasn't been seen since. Dammit.
