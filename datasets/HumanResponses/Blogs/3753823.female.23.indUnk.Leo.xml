      I, possibly foolishly, signed up to be on my company's corporate games swim team in September. Once upon a time (around age 13, I reckon), I was quite a good swimmer. I was on the local swim team (the Stingrays), and I got my Bronze Medallion (the first step to lifeguarding). So for the past almost 10 years now I've considered myself a "good swimmer" because of that half-year of dedication.   Today I went to the lake. After lying in the sun for a bit (my belly and hips are more red than brown as I'd hoped, harumph) I decided to go in the water and "practice" a bit. So after standing there in hip-deep water for about 15 minutes (I'm such a wuss in cold water) I finally got in. My freestyle is still good, form-wise, but stamina... well that's a whole other story. It goes basically like this: stroke-stroke-stroke breathe x 3, and I'm spent, legs scrabbling for solid ground and arms tired. I did that about four times and then my triceps started to get sore and my stomach queasy. (It used to get that way in swim team too, but that was usually after swimming 15 laps or something. Not about 15 feet!)  So clearly I need more practice. This is going to be humiliating.

       Chick Lit  I am so over chick lit. I don't know how those books ever held my interest. Except for the original Bridget Jones - brilliant. These days I'm into contemporary fiction. And I'm always trying to be into classics but it's hard. I'm also trying to read A Brief History of Time but it's pretty slow-going. It's a deep read.   Spore City  I have a bad habit of leaving food on the kitchen counter for days. I was just forced to clean some dishes (nothing clean left - believe me I left it as long as possible) and there were some major spores in the sink. Yuck.

      Oh man. This kid I met at the bar last weekend keeps calling me. He's pretty cute but a bit weird and I don't really want to go on any dates with him or anything like that. (Why bother??) I did have coffee with him the other night and he gave me a tour of the Coast Guard boat so that was pretty neat but he's just not my type. Just now on the phone he kept saying "yeppers" and "gotcha." *shudder* Both phrases I can't stand.  Meanwhile previous "boyfriend" also wrote response e-mail to my breakup e-mail. Painful. :(

       Cher   On the way home from work today my Cher CD skipped. Carp! [Beth and I purposely misspell and missay "crap" because we think "carp" is funnier. We also like to say "Oh my Gord" instead of taking the Lord's name in vain... Also because we think it's funny. And we have a friend called Gord.]   If I can't listen to "Just Like Jesse James" ten times a day in my car what else do I have??    GD Paper-Wasters   My office is so terrible about wasting paper. It's awful - the women that sit around me will print out every single thing from e-mails and web sites, and it makes me crazy every time I see them walking to the printer (many times a day.) This one time, this one particular woman needed to do a draw of over 200 names I had listed in my email, and she had me print out every single email, each on a separate page. So over 200 sheets of paper in one fell swoop. Sickening! But I'm not sure how/if I can bring it up without sounding petty.   I just worry that if our little 80-person office is wasting this much paper, how many millions of sheets are being needlessly printed out every day in offices in New York, Toronto, around the world??     Orca Update   Got my picture taken with the pea-pod orca the other night. Summer goal is to have photo taken with each and every orca (statue) in town. Am at 5 now! 48 to go...
