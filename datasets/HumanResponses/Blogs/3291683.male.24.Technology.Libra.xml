      Well, I just created this, out of curiosity mostly.  I'm curious to see how I do using this thing.  So hang around...  Hopefully I'll have a few more things up here soon.

      My mother has an eye appointment in the area, today, so she's going to take my wife and I out to lunch.  My boss gave me a strange look about a long lunch (yet again), but didn't argue, and only made fun of me over it a little.  It's not like I don't take the fewest long lunches in my department, or anything...  Fresnos is looking like the most likely victim for our little mini family reunion.  Should be fun; they had a good salad last time I was there, and I'm looking forwards to having it.  Just not in the mood for a hamburger today, and salads are healthier anyway.  Now if I can just figure out why my mother has this weirdness about always calling my wife instead of me, but only if we're at work...  If you hadn't noticed from my earlier posts, my wife and I work at the same place.  It's a financial publishing company, prints books and such.  There really aren't too many of those about, I'm told, but I'm really a bit oblivious about our industry.  I just worry myself with my computers and my programs and my share of the errors out on the production servers, and the rest of the company quietly ignores my ignorance and works anyway.  :)  She doesn't program, though; she's an account manager, and has the incredibly fun and exciting job of getting varying levels of verbal abuse from both sides about how stupid the customers or the tech/laser departments are, depending on whom she is talking with at the time.  We, of course, up here in our ivory electronic tower, are convinced of our superiority, while the customers are absolutely convinced we're a bunch of blathering idiots.  The customers should just be happy they very rarely have to deal directly with the people up here.  "Customer service" seems to be something they actively cull when hiring.  Well, maybe not actively; just incidentally.  So with a little luck, I'll hear back today about my appeal on the degree from my school.  The graduate committee was waiting for someone who got back from vacation yesterday, in theory.  It's probably more likely that they'll reach a decision on it some time next week, or even the week after, but I can always hope.  Hope springs eternal and all that.  In less self-centered news,  here's  an interesting article.  Apparently, they're producing crude oil (or something very similar) from agricultural waste products.  What I find kinda amusing was the comment "The Carthage, Missouri, plant is currently producing 100-200 barrels of oil per day utilizing by-products from an adjacent turkey processing facility."  Turkey processing facility?  Disturbing in its own right.  But will this make cars smell like turkey?  Anyone else remember  this van  that ran on grease, but smelled like french fries when it was driving past?  :)  Well, apparently I actually have to fix a couple of print files now, so I'll close this out and maybe just write another entry later.

      I feel a lot better about work, now; it turns out a couple of my office-mates has just as little to do at the moment as I do.  I've been futzing around with side-projects (like I've written about half of a system to re-prioritize jobs on the job queue in an intelligent way), but none of it assigned.  But he's done even less than me over the last 72 hours, which is...  Reassuring.  Makes me feel like less of a hanger-on.  Still don't have anything really useful to do today, though.  They want to put a fourth person into our office, though.  I'm not particularly thrilled about the thought.  It's already one of the highest-traffic offices in the building (yay being support for the production systems...), and adding another person can only make it worse.  Of course, the rumour is that they're considering bricking (well, probably dry-walling) up the inner doorway (to my boss's office) and putting a door through from her office directly to the outer area, so people going to see her won't have to go through our office.  The only thing I'm afraid of then is the thermostat; it's in her office, and when the door's close, it becomes oven-like and unpleasant outside her office.  Opening the door stops it, but it'll be worse if they move the doorway.  Either way, a fourth person in here will start getting crowded.  We'll have to remove a bookshelf and two filing cabinets, and move the network printer, for the most likely position.  I voted for removing the random desk under the coatrack and putting the fourth one there between the two guys with windows (not me, of course), but I got a lot of "What were you THINKING?!?" glares when I suggested it.  It's not MY fault it's the most convenient place to put a desk, that involves the least rearrangement and removal of furniture, whether or not they want to share their wall.  There's enough room; they just don't want the company.  Or to give up their windows and move closer, so they won't have to talk across the fourth person.  When it comes down to it, though, our entire department is outgrowing our area.  The upstairs here (we're on the "second floor", because even though the first floor is double-height, there's nowhere where the second floor is anything more than a stairwell) has Tech, XICS, Internet, IT, Editorial, Special Projects, Quality Assurance, Graphic Design... And - just to top things off - the CEO/Co-Owner.  Lots of people spread between...  I think four actual departments, with lots of sub-groups.  There are a couple of empty cubes, but no empty offices, and we have two people in-coming, plus hiring calls out for at least one more position.  To even handle those three I know of, we're probably going to need to take an entire group and move them...  Though to where, I'm not sure.  Well, it's not really my problem.  I'm just a lowly entry-level programmer, at least technically.  Most of the time, we can really use the manpower; we really needed two more programmers than we had, back in November.  Silly cyclical project schedules...  So my poor wife had to come in early today, because of the time she missed yesterday afternoon with the cat.  Got up at 5:00 AM, after four hours or so of sleep.  I feel bad for her.  She was somewhat bitter about my getting to sleep in.  Of course, the cats got her revenge for her...  One was cuddling me while I was half asleep at 6:00 AM, and then suddenly bit me for reasons I'm still not certain of.  I think he just doesn't like to have his belly rubbed, but both other cats do, so I was confused.  Either way, it woke me up...  A full two hours before normal.  I wasn't particularly amused.  But it was nice anyway, because he's been so unhappy-seeming and non-cuddly recently.  It's nice that he's finally back in a somewhat cuddly mood.  I've missed it, even if it did often mean being woken up at an unfortunate hour in the morning.  Like this morning.  This morning also had an interesting and disturbing first-time event for contacts: when putting in my left one, it managed to fold in half and go entirely under my lower eyelid.  It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out where it had gone.  I felt like SOMETHING was in my eye, but I couldn't see it, and I couldn't find it in the sink or on the counter...  Highly disconcerting, let me tell you.  :)  In other (non-me-oriented) news, there's a  urlLink commentary  here about Star Wars Episode III.  While it's kinda cruel to Lucas, I do hope he manages to pull it together some for this movie.  The Anakin Skywalker from Ep. II has nothing in common with the dark, planet-shattering malevolence of Darth Vader.  At least Yoda had an interesting personality in the first two.  The word on the "final battle" (after all, don't ALL the Star Wars movies have a big important final battle?) scene sounds...  Gimmicky.  Anakin and Obi-Wan dueling while surfing on hover-boards over lava?  Ummm...  Well, I suppose that's one way to get put on life support.  Ah, well.  Back to the grind of...  Errr...  Well, doing nothing.

      So after a long boring day of sitting at work wishing I had more work to do, I'm now...  Drum roll please...  Sitting at work waiting for my wife to get back from the vet so that we can go home!  YAY!  Since I'm not on the clock and nothing exciting is happening, I'm re-reading 8-bit theater.  At least I'm amused.  Well, except for the whole "dry eyes" and "being hungry" things.  :)  I feel bad for the cat, though.  She's apparently very traumatized.  Something about vets and dogs and long waits and cages.  It wasn't very clear.

      I was just playing around on Terraserver, on Microsoft's site, and found aerial photos of both my current house where I live with my wife now, and my parents' house.  They're both from 1995; I have no clue who was living in my house then, but in '95, my parents, sister and I were living in my parents' house.  Kinda nifty, knowing that there was a good chance of my being in the house on that day.  I could even make out the little blob that was probably my pool.  I mean, the resolution wasn't great (1 pixel to 1 meter, I think?) but it was enough to see the roads, the roof, things like that.  Nifty feeling.  Makes me wonder what else I should go and look up...  But either way, I probably shouldn't look them up from work, no matter how bored I am at the moment.  Lets see...  It's 2004 now...  I guess I would have been in senior year of high school then?  Not an unreasonable guess.  I'll have to re-check the date and figure it out, because now I'm really curious.  Heck, maybe I was in the pool when that picture was taken.  :)  Yup, right now I'm just sitting here waiting for someone to give me something to do.  I have two issues and a job ticket, but they're all waiting on someone else, so I'm pretty much just bored out of my mind.  I mean, I guess most people would like to not have enough work to do and rightfully just sit here, but I'm bored.  I can't do too much, so I end up surfing, and that doesn't amuse me as much as I'd hope.  Andy and Kristy and I have decided to bite the bullet and let them use two characters for the campaign.  It'd be better if we simply had more players, but with only two characters it's very hard to make encounters survivable.  They have only a modicum of firepower, but no magical support, no healing...  Just difficult to not overwhelm them or make the encounters hopeless.  So, they're going to be making a second character each.  It'll end up being something very close to a boring traditional party (rogue, ranger, cleric, wizard), but it'll at least be far more functional than just a rogue and a ranger wandering around.  In theory, I guess, they should have high enough hide and move silently skills to get around, but they're just too low level, at the point where luck can still throw it off very easily.  Their equipment is poor, they have no support, they have trouble with relatively simple tasks...  Just because of lack of numbers and resources.  Frustrating for me.  My garage is progressing.  It's taking forever to strip all the paint off of it, but I'm hoping I can bum a power sprayer off of someone so that actually re-painting it afterwards will be much faster.  The back door is done; the kitchen window we've started, but half gave up on; the basement windows are rotten, and need to be re-framed; and the ceiling of the back porch we've stared at really hard.  Darn paint doesn't fall off under staring, even my wife's.  *grumbles*  Why couldn't the seller have done this?  Or why couldn't the state have said "Well, if the buyer really doesn't care, lets leave it alone!"  I suppose it wasn't the state...  I think it's federal laws that cover this inspection.  My subscription to Planetside officially expires today, and I'm not renewing it.  It's a fun game, but is it really $13 per month fun?  Hard to say.  The past week and a half, I haven't played at all, but I played a bunch the two weeks before that.  I guess I'll just revert to Diablo II for my *cough* copious spare time.  That, or sleeping.  I might have to pick between them the way things are going right now.  My eyes are having a very bad day, all things told.  Yesterday was great: I got both contacts in on the first try for the first time since I started wearing them again (I wonder if I was wearing contacts back in 1995?  I think I had reverted to glasses by then)...  They felt good all day...  No noticeable problems of any kind.  Today, though, they were a pain to put in, they've been running very dry all day, I got shooting pains in one of them at one point (still don't know why), and they've been itching like crazy.  The wife suggests allergies.  I figure they're mad at me for some reason; no clue why, though.  It's gotten to the point where my glasses are uncomfortable and the (fairly small) difference in prescription gives me a headache; so it's difficult to wear them in the evenings, now.  I find myself wanting to wear the contacts longer, as long as possible, to avoid that; but tonight isn't looking hopeful.  Yesterday, one of my friends wanted help with a Tic Tac Toe AI for some random project.  I think I'll go work on that now, and see if I can't write something up to e-mail to him, in hopes of it not being too late.  I don't know VB, so I can't code it for him, but if I can get the algorithm written, he should be able to do it himself.  Serves him right for writing in VB instead of C# or Java; now he can't get me to do his assignments for him.  Unless it's more for fun than for an assignment.  I really don't know.

      People who act all superior to me really bug me.  It sets me off at the strangest times, sometimes.  I mean, my temper is much better than it used to be, but some smug SOB goes off with an "I know more than you do" attitude, assuming he can just run over my objections with a shrug, it bugs me soooo much!  I mean, I'm NOT an idiot, bluntly.  I know what I'm talking about, or I know enough to know that I can't form a good argument on the subject.  If they could actually formulate a counter-argument and refute my position, that's one thing; but if all they say is "Well, if you knew anything about this, it'd be OBVIOUS to see...", it just really sets me off.  Today was a really dumb one.  Someone on a message board, talking about hatchets and other physical weapons in the game of BattleTech.  This guy's claim was that since they're an "edged" weapon (relative term on that scale), hatchets should do partial damage to armor and partial to structure, instead of full damage to armor.  I said that I couldn't see the argument, based on the fact that all the weapons in the game are theoretically armor-piercing; it's just a matter of whether or not the armor-defeating nature succeeds or fails.  He replied with "If you knew anything about the physics of it, it'd be obvious to see."  Which, of course, pissed me off, because I have a lot of training in physics; certainly more than most people, and probably more than him!  Argh.  Why people can't just shut their freaking traps when they don't know what they're talking about, instead of actually attacking a person who offers a serious counter-argument, I'll never understand.  My faith in people, though, continues to decline.

      I don't understand why computers hate me so much.  I mean, I've wast--errr, spent enough of my life working on them, you'd think that they'd get along better with me.  My last two laptops both died horrible, painful deaths, and resisted all attempts at resurrection; my wife's laptop seems to detest the concept of getting a functional CD driver; hell, the company's support group denies that the model even exists, let alone that they ever had a CD-ROM drive, and oh by the way, here's the driver so it works.  And one of my old scrap desktops managed to kill a network card somewhere between running Windows and installing Linux.  I don't know exactly when, but when I last turned off the computer as a Windows box, it functioned; when resurrected as a Linux box, the little lights blinked and the computer swore up and down the card existed, but no connection was there for me to play with.  When transplanted back to a different Windows machine, same thing; recognized by the system, pretty blinking lights, but no connection.  Darn it if I knew why.  I'm just waiting for my current laptop to give up the ghost; I can't afford to replace this one, or even really repair it.  *sighs*  That's a sad thought.  No upgrades for the cute l'il desktop, either.  At least I have a couple of new models I can work on; I'm excited about them, and I'll get to do fun things with them.  If I ever get around to working on them, of course.  We all know how pathetically slow I am at that.  I'm kinda frightened about painting the infantry; I don't know how on earth I might get them to come out well.  But we'll see.

      My freaking academic status is finally, finally clearing up!  The graduate committee for the CS department at my graduate school has agreed that I should get my Masters, against the desires of my former advisor.  I'm glad that it's finally going to get resolved at all, but the fact that it's falling in my favor is highly reassuring.  Sadly, I still have a lot to do before I even think of going back for a PhD, let alone getting it...   But we'll see how it goes.  That may be up the road a little bit, too.

      One of my co-workers just gave me a piece of paper, and said "What date does it say?"  The piece of paper had "2004-01-04" on the top corner.  I immediately responded "January 4th, 2004" without thinking about it the tiniest bit.  He said "So the month is the one in the middle?"  And y'know, he's right; for the average American, that IS a serious question, and if I had actually stopped to think about it, I really wouldn't have been sure offhand.  Funny how just the little things can throw you off, heh?

      The new game store wasn't nearly as exciting as I had hoped it might be.  It actually has quite a good selection, but the prices are kinda high, and the store store looks extremely bare - it looks like they have one or two copies of most games and puzzles, and nothing else.  I guess it might be good for finding things I can't find anywhere else local, but with the prices they have (typically slightly above list) I think I'll find myself searching at the other local stores or just ordering it instead.  I'm sad; I had high hopes.  It looks, though, like a few people from the old store that used to be there decided not to just close down when the store went away.  I give them my best wishes, but I don't currently hold high hopes for their doing incredibly well, even in a mall as busy as that one.  The weather is still just very poor around this area, too.  It feels like the rain hasn't stopped for weeks, and that isn't far off the truth.  The amount of rain we've had around here recently just feels unreal; I don't remember the last time there was anywhere NEAR this much rain in New York.  Maybe it's just my imagination, and it really secretly happens every year, but it feels like a new experience to me.  So for those photography buffs out there, check out  this article .  I read through it, and it interested me quite a bit.  I'm not a photographer, but my wife is in her spare time, and the technology interested me.  I read a lot of the discussion at  Slashdot  about it, and people there seemed to be a lot more cynical about it.  Me, I figure that even if it IS pretty much all old tech applied in a quasi-new way, the results are gorgeous.  It may not be some amazing revolutionary new technology, but the guy should still get credit.  So I should finally be getting new links for my watch, soon.  This is a  Citizen EcoDrive Skyhawk , one of the older (original) models in the line, that I got from my wife as an engagement/marriage present.  (I actually got it before the wedding, but its primary purpose at the time was to go with my suit for the honeymoon.)  It's a really nice watch, but the band is a tad too small.  Do you have ANY clue how hard it is to get links for this thing?!?  I tried six or seven jewelry stores over six months, and most of them just referred me to the company.  The company, of course, said they don't direct-order them, and I should do it through the place I purchased it.  I eventually got one guy to say he'd call them and order them and then contact me, but he never did.  But I have a receipt now...  And I was TOLD they'd already been ordered...  So I'm hoping they'll come this time, and I'll be able to start wearing my watch again without cutting off circulation or pinching a nerve - or whatever it is that makes it so darnedly uncomfortable on my hand.  It's actually a really really nice watch, though.  It's got the main dial, of course, which is digitally driven.  It has two smaller dials: 24-hour time that matches the main dial, and UTC (Universal Time Code, I believe) that typically matches Greenwich.  That is, it always SHOULD match Greenwich, but doesn't necessarily, if the time's screwed up.  :)  Right now it's showing, ummm, 19:58, which I hope is correct (3:58 +5 +1 for DST?  Or should it be 17, 3:58 +5 -1?...  I can never remember...)  Anyway.  It also has a digital display that, in normal operation, shows the time of the city you choose.  It comes with like 20 or 30 pre-programmed cities, and you can add a couple more, using a 3-letter city code.  You can also "turn them off", so that when you're cycling through you only get the ones you're interested in; for example, I left Anchorage and London active, but killed Paris, Mexico City, and Moscow.  It has at least one in every time zone, plus a few spares.  The cool part is, though, that you choose the city you want, and then hold both buttons for a second, and it trades the digital and analog time-zones!  So if your analog is set to NYC time, you can set the digital to London time, hold both buttons for a second, and poof!  The analog sets itself to London time and the digital shows NYC time.  I love that feature; it's incredibly useful for travel, because not only can you show two different times and save yourself a headache, but switching between times is really easy; easy enough that you can do it painlessly even on a layover in Chicago on your way from New York to Vancouver, for example.  Yes, that case really came up.  :)  Anyway.  In addition, it holds the date (of course), has a stopwatch/chronograph/timer, and three alarms.  I love this thing.  I'm glad I'll finally be able to wear it again soon!  The one thing I've really just never taken the time to learn is the circular slide-rule that's included on the inside and outside of the dial.  Some day, I'll figure it out, but not today.  :)  My friend Andy actually recently got himself a new watch, and ended up going with the "blue angels" Skyhawk.  It has a leather band instead of metal (I really prefer metal, he apparently really prefers the leather), and different trim, and a slightly different-shaped dial; otherwise it's the same.  I told him I already had one, and he looked a bit crestfallen.  He makes more than me (more than my wife and I together, in fact), but I feel like he takes a little too much joy sometimes in having better toys than me.  He's a good guy, and I enjoy our time together, though.  I have my own list of faults.  :)  I'm finally going to get to try Aliens vs. Predator 2 today.  A co-worker hasn't played it in months, so he said I could borrow it long enough to decide if I want to buy it or not.  The demo was horrific, but all the reviews said the game was a million times better...  Yes, I know, I know, another evil vicious shooter game which will send me straight to hell...  Eh, whatever.  I'm in it more for the ambience and the technological bits and the twitchy action.  I'm not homicidal.  Promise!  Never even have been!  Really!!!  :)  Seriously...  This game got amazing reviews, and I just never quite got around to buying a copy, and I'm glad to finally see what's behind it all!  The first game was good, but had a lot of weaknesses; by the sounds of it, the second one fixes pretty much all of them.  I'm excited.  My favorite in the original was always the Predator.  I've always done better as the ninja-type player than the line soldier, just because of my reactions and such.  The Marines always just got me killed.  The Aliens...  Oi, they were HARD in the original!  Far too easy for even the civilians to kill you, sometimes.  Not to mention the lack of ability to save during a mission!  But this is supposed to have improved even on all of that, and made all the races more fun to play, so we'll see how it goes.  Ah, well; I guess I'll sign off for today.  Take care.

      Apparently, they've already put a new game store in at the mall.  The old one died only a week or two ago; I actually think that Wizards of the Coast killed all of the Gamekeeper stores, though I haven't bothered to confirm that, since I only know where two are, and one's far enough away that I've visited it twice ever.  Either way, the local one closed.  I expected that the store would be empty for a while...  But to my surprise, that was just entirely false, according to my friend.  He says there's a store there already, being all store-like and doing store-ish things.  (Stores are notorious for those types of activities, you know.)  Since my wife is busy this evening, and I'm already so close to the mall, I'll stop by on the way home and see what I can see.  Should be interesting.  So the newest thing from my friendly neighborhood online forum that annoyed me was someone who said that my explanation that napalm primarily affects a metal object through conducting heat (as opposed to melting it, burning it, convecting heat, radiating heat, or anything else) defied the laws of physics, without actually giving a counter-argument to anything I had said.  He said my explanation meant that lasers should cause heat to the targets they hit (ummm, they typically do) and that flamethrowers should cause heat (again...  They do).  Ugh.  Grrr.  For those who feel completely lost, I'm talking about  BattleTech , a board/war/strategy game that I picked up a long time ago (back in junior high school) and got into more recently.  I started collecting  miniatures  and painting them just a year or two ago.  I don't think any pictures of my models are online, but there are a bunch at  Lords of the Battlefield  and  Camo Specs Online .  The former is a random community website with a highly active forum; the latter is specifically a bunch of camo schemes from "real world" military units in the game.  There are a lot, like hundreds or maybe even thousands, of units, and some have never actually been given more than a one-sentence description of their paint scheme, but others have been done up in great detail and artwork.  My favorite faction is a little one-planet independant waaaay out on the fringes of humanity, which models itself after an ancient order of knights.  They're known as the Brotherhood of Randis, the military arm of the Fiefdom of Randis, on the planet of Randis IV.  Blue-and-silver.  I have maybe five or six models done up in their colors; every time I mean to do more, I get distracted and never quite get around to it.  There's actually a contest coming up, now, that I want to do this for...  There's a tournament called the Martial Olympiad.  It is a series of scenarios, where you register with a faction and a force and play the scenarios against other people for points.  The highest-scoring person worldwide (there are European, Australian, and even Russian players; or were last year, at least) gets a prize.  But this year, Camo Specs is running a painting contest simultaneously, where you have to paint up your force in the colors of a unit from your faction.  I'm looking forwards to it.  Plus, it'll be kinda cool to have your units in the correct colors, rolling (or walking, or hovering, or flying) across the battlefield.  :)  And for those of you who aren't quite so militarily inclined, my wife is working her way up to trying to convince me to get a new cat.  This one is a cat called Mouse, who lives in the adoption agency's cages at the local Petsmart.  He looks weirdly like Lady in coloration and pattern, to the point you almost think they're related, except we know they can't be TOO closely related, unless someone's lieing or mis-informed.  He's listed as only a year and a half old, meaning he's too close in age to Lady to be either father or a second litter from her mother (brother?  I suppose...).  Her litter was four kittens; however, the only other one with her coloration was female, not male.  The males were both yellow-and-white with long hair.  So it's just a coincidence, I guess, but it's a cute one.  Either way, my wife has fallen in love with this cat, and is starting to get defensive about him.  She's gonna make a push for adopting him soon, and it's tough.  On the one hand, he really IS cute, and I wonder if our cats would get along better with an even number (4) rather than 3.  On the other hand, he's got a $90 "adoption fee" (ha, ha...  But the agency DOES have to survive, and so I don't begrudge them the fee.  I just think the name is...  Odd), he'd be a fourth cat when I'm allergic and three occasionally is difficult for me, and we already have one cat more than people when it comes to trying to give attention and affection.  Plus, of course, the upkeep costs of feeding another cat, and using more litter, and cleaning up after him...  Well, I have to run and get out of here.  Hope your evening goes well.

      This office is too hot.  Ugh.  I wish they'd fix the climate controls in here.  The weekend was yet another fun and exciting weekend of doing work, and wishing I wasn't doing work.  The garage now actually has its first coat of real paint on it (and primer, too!).  Sadly, the Garage isn't finished, by any stretch; we've only done the side, and we have to do over the door on the front, also.  I wish we could just tear it down and start from scratch, but that would involve money we don't have.  For that matter, there's a LOT of things we want to do: replace pretty much every window in the house with nice vinyl windows, finishing off a room in the basement to be a darkroom for my wife, getting me a nice workbench/area in the basement, re-siding the house, getting rid of the huuuge tree in our back yard that my neighbor hates (we haven't lived there long enough to hate it yet) and I'm afraid is going to fall on our house, pave the driveway, replace the garage entirely, replace the front and back doors, re-carpet the living room...  I know, it's practically a never-ending list, but hey.  That's how houses go, I suppose; a never-ending source of projects and time-sinks.  I have to admit, at least, that I'm quite impressed with how cool our house typically stays.  It's obviously not the worst of the summer yet, but I have high hopes I'll survive without melting into a pool of sludge.  Soooooo, who here is familiar with  Popcap Games ?  They're a great company that does some very amusing stuff.  My favorite game, at the moment, is  Rocket Mania .  Simple concept, good gameplay, and I find it a lot of fun.  I just wish I could afford to waste the $25 on a registered version right now.  I strongly recommend you guys take a shot at it and see how you do; who knows, you might even enjoy it.  The other game I think is definitely worth checking out is Bookworm.  It's actually good even as an educational program.  Give it a shot; you just might like it.  The weather up in this corner of the country is...  Exciting, I'd say, right now.  We're in the middle of a whole bunch of massive storms, which are apparently spawning Tornados.  It sounds like fun, doesn't it?  I just hope my cats are okay.  At least one of them is pretty afraid of thunder.  Yes, that'd be the one who woke me up at 3:00 AM because she really wanted to be under the covers, and I was apparently in the way.  She left a half hour later, of course, because...  Ummm, well, I really don't know why.  She's like that, I suppose.  I have three cats, for those that haven't caught on.  The oldest is Lady Meowsalot (my wife named this one), Defender of the Western Litterbox, who once meowed loudly outside the kitchen door, who bravely assaulted my wife's hair while my wife was getting ready for work, and who napped repeatedly in treacherous and high places where only the bravest cats go.  Or something like that.  Commonly known as "Lady".  She's a very small gray-and-white, just a little over a year old.  Short-furred, very beautiful; she's the climber in the family.  We often come home to find her on the wall at the end of the bath tub in our downstairs bathroom, or on top of the highest cupboard in the kitchen.  She also has a stuffed bear from our honeymoon in Alaska that she just loves.  The bear is on our bed, and every night after we're in bed, she'll come up on the bed, knead the bear for a few minutes, and then demand to be let under the covers so she can hang out.  She never stays there all night, but it's very important to her that she be under there for a few minutes.  Lady is actually very thin.  Personally, I think it's because of her mother.  Lady was born after the mother had been rescued, but during pregnancy the mommy cat was a stray, and badly undernourished; she almost didn't survive for the kittens to be born.  I'm thinking she didn't develop quite right because of it.  When we first got her, she had this funny half-meow, where she'd open her mouth and look like she was trying to meow, but most of it was silent except for a little squeak at the end.  We never did figure that one out, and she grew out of it.  When we got her, it was entirely my wife's fault.  She had gotten into the habit (back when we didn't work in the same company, let alone the same building) of stopping at the pet store once or twice a week and visiting the cats up for adoption.  One day, this little gray-and-white kitten curled up on her should, and she was doomed.  She filled out an application, saying "I have to get this okayed by my husband"...  And she swore up and down she wasn't attached to this cat...  But that was just a terrible un-truth, and so we got the cat.  :)  It was exciting, because we technically weren't allowed to have cats in the apartment...  In fact, we had all three cats before we left there; but no we're in our own house, and WE make the rules.  :)  The next-oldest cat is Poe Bloggs, commonly known as "Poey".  I named after "Joe Bloggs".  Look it up if you don't recognize the name.  :)  He's a funny little black-and-white cat; a black back and head, but a white mask (the black JUST BARELY touches his right eye, but the rest of his face and muzzle is white).  Kinda spotted.  I really WANTED to name him "Lurtz", because his face really does look like the evil guy from LoTR, but my wife didn't let me get away with it.  About 9 months old, maybe 11?  Also, he's not particularly bright.  His idea of getting attention is head-butting you until you give in to his demands.  Reading?  Head-butt the book until you drop it, then head-butt you until you pet him.  Sleeping?  Climb onto your chest and head-butt your head until you wake up and pay attention.  On the computer?  Jump into your lap and head-butt you.  He also enjoys chasing the mouse pointer around the computer screen (I've never been particularly fond of that habit), because OBVIOUSLY it's an EEEEEVIL mouse pointer.  Yup.  And he's got to save us from it!  He's definitely my favorite of the three, though he's much more "our cat" now than he used to be.  His sense of balance, though it has improved greatly, is still not the best; he commonly jumps up on something, lays down, and promptly falls off.  Nowhere near as agile as Lady.  He eats a lot, and is a little overweight.  He doesn't meow; but he does chirp (he sounds more like my guinea pigs than like the other cats!), and his purr is hilarious.  It's this manic half-the-time purr, like he can only purr while breathing out and not while breathing in, or something.  I've never heard another cat quite like him.  The third cat is  Elendil , named by me, and about 6-7 months old; he's commonly known as "Ellie", and people yell at me for naming him a feminine name.  My wife wasn't thrilled with the name, but couldn't come up with a better one, and eventually caved.  Lady was entirely my wife's fault, and Poey was kinda a mutual desire for Lady not to be lonely during the day while we were both out, but I'll admit Ellie was pretty much my fault.  I've always had a love for black cats, and Ellie is a black with a little white star on his chest and tiny white traces on his legs.  We were buying cat supplies (natch) at the pet store, and this kitten just broke my heart...  So he came home with us.  Of course, he's a little wimp, and spent the better part of a week hiding under the couch, but he's gotten over it (mostly) now.  He's entirely unafraid of the other cats (he's actually the biggest, though I think Poe still weighs slightly more), and plays quite rough; him and Lady only grudgingly get along.  Elendil and Poe, though, get along great; we have pictures somewhere of them sleeping together.  My favorite time (I don't think we have a picture of this one) was them laying facing opposite directions on the couch, with Poe's paw under Ellie's head and Poe's head over Ellie's neck.  Very, very cute.  :)  He's gotten a lot more cuddly recently with us people, too, which is good, since the cats are nice enough to let us live there.  Very timid cat.  He LOOKS overweight, with a lot of loose skin, but he isn't as heavy as Poe, and he doesn't act overweight.  It's kinda odd.  This cat is the most vocal, by far.  If he decides he's alone, he'll get upset and start chirping or meowing.  In fact, even if he's just downstairs in my wife's office and we're upstairs in the bedroom, he'll cry until someone goes down to get him, even though he prefers to follow us up himself than be carried.  Of course, it doesn't have to be US that goes to get him; it can be a cat, too.  Wow, I rambled on about the cats more than I meant to.  But since I've already wasted so much page space on three of the pets, I may as well go on and talk about the other three.  Besides our cats, we have two guinea pigs and a rabbit.  The Rabbit's name is Thumper, and my wife got him a while back in college.  He REALLY hates men.  I mean, not dislikes and avoids, but HATES.  He's bitten me more times in two years than he has my wife in five.  He's cute enough, but he chews anything he can get his teeth on...  As long as its mine.  He's destroyed several pairs of pants, several shoelaces, one pair of shoes, a backpack, and a laptop power cord, that I know of.  I'm really not very fond of him.  It's not just me, though; it's other men, too.  Just that I'm the one around the most.  The Guinea Pigs are mine.  The first was actually a Valentine's day present last year from my wife; I named her Samantha.  We went and got another to keep Samantha company, and this one I named Harriet.  Harriet, unfortunately, died young; she fell and broke her neck.  I was very, very upset over that.  :-(  A couple of weeks later (Harriet had a cold, and it went back and forth between the two Guinea Pigs for two months), we got a new one, and named her Guenevere.  They live in their cage next to Thumper's, though their life isn't particularly exciting.  They make lots of noise while we're in the kitchen.  :)  Hmmmm, and on that note, I need to get them some lettuce.  Anyway.  This post has turned very log, and with very little of interest...  So I think I'll cut it off.  Have a good day, y'all.

      I'm alive.  Honest.  I haven't posted in a while, but I'll get back into it soon.  I'll try to get a post in today...  Not that anyone reads this, but hey, it's still a nice place to rant.

      Creating titles for Blogs is like an art form all of its own.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; But that's besides the point, eh?   Our first coat of&nbsp;real paint (as opposed&nbsp;to primer)&nbsp;went on the bedroom Wednesday.&nbsp; A dark purple, "Sugar Plum".&nbsp; It's a Behr color, I think?&nbsp; Just the one she liked most from Home Depot.&nbsp; We were originally going to do the next coat tonight, but that's looking less and less likely now.&nbsp; More to the point, one of her friends was supposed to be visiting next weekend (the 31st, or something?&nbsp; Maybe the 30th?)&nbsp; But now it turns out that they had their wires crossed.&nbsp; Her friend (Theresa) was expecting to be coming  this  weekend.&nbsp; If they hadn't talked last night, Theresa would have just shown up tomorrow morning, and probably neither of us would have been awake.&nbsp; I TOLD her I thought it was a different weekend than the 30th she'd originally mentioned to me, but she didn't believe me...&nbsp; :)  So the moral of the story is: getting woken up at 9 in the morning on a Saturday when you're trying to sleep in is the price for not listening to your husband.&nbsp; Always remember that, folks.  So the current plan is to go to my parents' some time this weekend.&nbsp; Some time tomorrow is a likely thing, but exactly when is still up in the air. Y'see, I have this BattleTech tournament this weekend, kinda.&nbsp; The Martial Olympiad is going on until...&nbsp; The end of August, I think?&nbsp; And my local Commando (the guy who runs such things) wanted to try and knock out three of the scenarios tomorrow.&nbsp; Thing is, last I head, it was a very up-in-the-air proposition...&nbsp; And so I don't know if tomorrow's get-together is still really on.&nbsp; But we're supposed to be going to my parents' after that goes on.  Next week is actually my wedding anniversary.&nbsp; I really don't know what we're going to be doing for that, yet; the plans we had were scrapped, and now everything's up in the air.&nbsp; I still don't even have her&nbsp;a present, because I'm just not sure what to buy.&nbsp; She normally sees all the credit card bills and everything, so it's very difficult to get her something that she doesn't know to the penny how much it cost...&nbsp; I'll have to ask her to just not look at the credit-card bill for the next month or two, or something, so I can sneak her present through.&nbsp; I have an idea of what I want to get...&nbsp; It's just hard to decide, on occasion.&nbsp; And time, of course, is running out.  In other news, I've been paying a lot more attention to  urlLink Board Game Geek , a fun little web site.&nbsp; It has entries for almost every board game in existence, and some that don't really exist any more in addition.&nbsp; If you're registered, you can write articles and such, including Session Reports...&nbsp; So I've been making a point of trying to report my various games&nbsp; on there.&nbsp; Not always much of a purpose, I know, but it is kinda amusing, and it wastes time when I'm bored.  On that note, I suppose I should go.&nbsp; Have fun, folks.

      Obviously, my plan to post last week never occured.&nbsp; I guess, since noone ever seemed to read this, my motivation was pretty low.&nbsp; But Alredhead posted a couple of comments, and even if they were just more or less in response to my comment on her blog, I feel like I should put  SOMETHING  new here...  So let me show you a  urlLink photo gallery &nbsp;that has my pictures in it.&nbsp; It's very small right now, but I'm going to start expanding it shortly.&nbsp; When I have the time, I'll go through and take better pictures of all the models I have finished painting, and post them in there.&nbsp; The 3rd picture, in case you don't realize, is a sub-gallery; it's an "in-progress" series that shows my work during the actual creation of that mini.&nbsp; No finished pics are in there yet (I've varnished it since the last one in the sub-gallery, which changes the colors a bit), but it's all pretty close.  I take a lot of pride in some of the minis I do.&nbsp; I'm nowhere near the level of some people I know (or know of), like  urlLink Eric Lautenschlager &nbsp;or  urlLink Drew Williams , but I like to think I'm at least not terrible.  But minis are on hold for tonight.&nbsp; Tonight, I get to paint my spare bedroom.&nbsp; After weeks of pushing it off, we finally finished taping it two days ago, and yesterday it got a primer coat.&nbsp; We're hoping it'll only need to actual coats of paint.&nbsp; That might be a bit optimistic...&nbsp; But hope springs eternal and all that jazz.&nbsp; I'll try to remember to take a couple of pictures of it when it's done.  The painting upsets our cats, though.&nbsp; They don't like being locked upstairs, which we have to do while painting that room.&nbsp; Oy, they'll hate it even more if we ever have to do something drastic like paint the dining room or the living room.&nbsp; Well, they'll survive; or at least, they will so far.  I should really get going, and pack up to go home.&nbsp; Have&nbsp;a good night.

      At night, because we have an air conditioner in our bedroom, we close the door to my wife's office.&nbsp; You see, the stairs upstairs are in my wife's office on the first floor, and there's no door except the door between her office and the kitchen.&nbsp; Closing that door keeps the cold air in and means we're only cooling the upstairs and her office instead of the whole house, so it actually, y'know, functions and stuff.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; Since the litter box for our cats is upstairs, we need to make sure all the cats are upstairs before we close the door for the night.&nbsp; Typically the last thing we do as we're going upstairs is get the daily treats for the cats, so usually they rush upstairs without much trouble.  So last night, I got the treats, and was trying to convince cats to go upstairs, fairly unsuccessfully.&nbsp; Book in one hand, drink in another, cat treats in a third, and opening the door with my fourth hand, I was calling them, pushing them with feet, and trying to convince them that upstairs was really the best place to be.&nbsp; I started saying to myself "Y'know, this is almost as bad as herding cats!", but I stopped partway through.  *sighs*  The moral?&nbsp; Yes, you really do get desensitized to common sayings like that, until they just have no connection to their actual original meaning.

        So anyway. Yeah, while most of that sounds vaguely accurate, I never realized I wanted to meet Jackie Kennedy. Doesn't QUITE sound like me. :) But then, you'll just have to take my word for it. Things like that have always amused me. Their accuracy, though, varies pretty widely; after all, they're all created by people like me... (Read "Too lazy to be doing something useful.") And isn't it just thrilling to know that I will soon be an epic miniseries event from TNT?!?!?   So it's my anniversary today. Doesn't that sound like fun? It is, I suppose. We're going out to dinner tonight; it's looking like Red Lobster. I know, I know, that isn't very fancy or nice or anything, but it's much cheaper than a black-tie restaurant, and that's something that concerns us both. Besides, at Red Lobster she can get her seafood fondue and pretend the carbs don't count, which'll make her very happy for a little bit. She actually got her present yesterday; a Precious Moments thing, "Bringing You my Heart". I'd link to it, but there don't seem to be any pictures of that particular one online. Suffice to say, I thought it was cute. Maybe I'll take a picture of it sometime, and post it myself, just for my very special Blog readers! Wouldn't that be great? Exclusive access to that picture... ;-)   Okay, so it really isn't all that exciting. But I can dream, can't I?   As a last treat (*cough cough*), for those of you who are bored, try reading through  urlLink this  short story that I'm working on.

      Just for fun...  I took a silly quiz, and got the following:              You're  The Mists of Avalon !    by Marion Zimmer Bradley      You're obsessed with Camelot in all its forms, from Arthurian legend  to the Kennedy administration. Your favorite movie from childhood was "The Sword in  the Stone". But more than tales of wizardry and Cuban missiles, you've focused on  women. You know that they truly hold all the power. You always wished you could meet  Jackie Kennedy.

      Yup, green.&nbsp; I didn't notice it until after I was at work this morning.&nbsp; Y'see, as much as my lawn is really small and fairly quick to mow, it's also kinda shady, and so it doesn't dry well.&nbsp; Add in the fact that it rained every day for a week and a half, and so we couldn't mow it, and I mowed it in a rush Saturday morning before running off to my parents' for the night...&nbsp; Well, it was distinctly not dry, but very long.&nbsp; When I went to my parents, I took my sandals and my loafers, not the boots; so yes, my boots are now distinctly green, and I only just noticed it a few minutes ago.&nbsp; Amazingly, no stupid comments from the co-workers, yet.   Here's to hoping it wears off soon!   Just to keep my life interesting, there are now yet more problems with my degree.&nbsp; The application went through and everyone was all set to just make it official and sign the documents and dot the i's and cross the t's...&nbsp; Until someone asked the Bursar's office.&nbsp; The Bursar, of course, said "No, his account is on hold; he owes us a large sum of money."&nbsp; What IS this money, you might ask?&nbsp; The $5,000 and change left over from fall of 2003 - when I wasn't a student.&nbsp; I was supposed to have been withdrawn well before the deadline, but somewhere the system failed, and I never was.&nbsp; A couple of months ago that $5,000 was supposed to have been dealth with by the vice president of the graduate school.&nbsp; Since I hadn't received a bill since December, and since all the paperwork and things went ahead for a couple of months with no problem, I just assumed that it was all good.&nbsp; I was accepted as a delayed part-time student, and everything...&nbsp; And NOW this freaking thing rears its ugly head again.&nbsp; Did it ever get dealt with?&nbsp; Noooooo.&nbsp; Do we know why?&nbsp; Not a clue.&nbsp; The guy who was supposed to have dealt with it then, and has to deal with it now, isn't there; he's out for the day.   My wife's response was "Why does everything have to be so difficult?&nbsp; Are you SURE I can't just beat them over the head with a 2x4?"&nbsp; And while I assured her that no, she couldn't, it took a conscious effort.&nbsp; NOTHING comes easily.&nbsp; I'd love, just once, for there to be a "Can I do this?"&nbsp; "YES!"&nbsp; And it be done.&nbsp; Once.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Well, once since my driver's license.&nbsp; That was the last vaguely important thing I can think of that went simply and without problem.&nbsp; Even my under-grad degrees had problems; some stupid complaint that was never closed out, and some weirdness in my status because I was a double-major, that almost delayed my graduation.  Some years, it just doesn't pay to have gotten out of bed.   And just to add insult to injury, my old dog is getting...&nbsp; Well, old.&nbsp; Star, the wonderful dog I grew up with, is just aging.&nbsp; I mean, we got her when I was in elementary school, and now she's just reaching the end of her time...&nbsp; But it's kinda painful to see her stiff and grumpy and gray and half-blind and -deaf.&nbsp; I'm afraid that next time I go to see my parents, she won't be there.&nbsp; It's a really depressing thought.   The trip to my parents' was pretty good, though.&nbsp; It was mostly because my parents wanted to take us out for dinner near our anniversary.&nbsp; My wife and I's anniversary is this Tuesday, the 27th.&nbsp; Our second anniversary, specifically.&nbsp; We're not doing much (it's expensive to take two days off work and go to a nice hotel!!!), but we'll go out for dinner, and I'll give her her present.&nbsp; Hopefully, a nice relaxing day.   And for those of you listening (*cough*) carefully, yes, I did say "give her her present" instead of "exchange presents" or something similar.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; because of my digital camera.&nbsp; It was probably far more than we can really afford, but she got it for me anyway, so it's pretty much the only gift I'm getting all year.&nbsp; And while it isn't exactly sentimental, it IS something that she knew I really really wanted, so complaint is the last thing she'll get from me on the subject.   Besides, if I know her (which I do fairly well...), she'll probably do something cute - get me a sheet of frog stickers, or find me a nice bookmark with a frog or a nice Bible passage, something cheap and sweet.&nbsp; Life is really good, on occasion.   So, um, yeah.&nbsp; Sidetracked, am I being, constantly.&nbsp; Trip to my parents...&nbsp; Anniversary...&nbsp; Dinner!&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; So we went out to dinner on Saturday night.&nbsp; A great little restaurant, called The Dickens.&nbsp; It's British-themed, so it tends to be a hit with my family.&nbsp; My wife had never been before, which was a nice addition.&nbsp; I got a wonderful (though not particularly British...) clam strips and fish, and fried calamari as an appetizer.&nbsp; It was quite good.&nbsp; Very unusually sea-food-ish for me (I tend to stick more with Beef and Chicken), but delicious all the same.  Yesterday, we went and visited the local flea market.&nbsp; This year (or, at least, this weekend), it wasn't very good, at least from my point of view.&nbsp; The guys who tend to do gaming books, board games, war games, models, and things of that nature didn't make an appearance.&nbsp; Even more unfortunately, the blacksmith/weaponsmith didn't show!!!&nbsp; Normally there's a guy there who makes swords and knives and similar things, and he wasn't there.&nbsp; There were two booths that had your stereotypical mass-produced imported katanas and stupid novelty knives and things like that, but nothing I was interested in.&nbsp; Well, there was one full-tang rope-wrapped sword, matte black, which was nice...&nbsp; I guess more like a big knife or a machete than a true sword.&nbsp; Very odd.&nbsp; Kindof a modernization of a half-Japanese half-South American item.&nbsp; Nothing like I'd ever seen before.&nbsp; Either way, I wasn't spending $300 on it, so I didn't buy it.   I did reach one odd conclusion, though.&nbsp; For some reason, it seems to be a common thing for people who sell knives and swords to also sell handcuffs.&nbsp; It struck me (and I really don't remember why) that both boothes that sold swords and such also sold handcuffs, but I didn't see them anywhere else at the flea market.&nbsp; When I noticed it, I also remembered that at our local mall, the pseudo-oriental-import store (it's all oriental style, but little of it is actually Chinese or Japanese; it tends to be cheap Indian knock-offs) also sells knives and swords - and handcuffs.&nbsp; Why on earth would they go together?&nbsp; I mean, if it was actually a blacksmith's store, I could see forged manacles or something...&nbsp; But...&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Just struck me as a weird correlation.   Either way.&nbsp; My wife got an Enlarger, for her hypothetical darkroom.&nbsp; It was really cheap, so we picked it up.&nbsp; Now, here's to hoping that it works!&nbsp; I, on the other hand, got sun-burnt.&nbsp; Pretty badly.&nbsp; I'm very pale and burn very easily, and I (of course...) forgot that until I'd been in the sun for two hours.&nbsp; Now, if only I had my cowboy hat I wanted from a few weeks ago...   I'm not certain why, but I have a really strong urge to learn how to photograph people better.&nbsp; In my head, I have these mental pictures of poses that I want to see taken as pictures, and so I'm leaning towards doing it myself.&nbsp; Now if only I knew how to work my camera better.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; In the process, though, I've also reached the conclusion that I prefer black-and-white photography to color photography, at least when it comes to portraiture.&nbsp; Color photos have their place, obviously, but when it comes to actual art, I can't help but feel that black-and-whites are just...&nbsp; Nicer, in an artistic sense.   Well, I should get back to work, at this point.&nbsp; I've finally received a piece of work to do.  Oh, and just because I can...&nbsp; I'll mention  urlLink Alredhead !&nbsp; She linked to my blog, which I think was very kind of her.&nbsp; If I ever get around to figuring out how to do it, I'll post a link to her blog over on the side of mine.&nbsp; But probably not today.&nbsp; :)

      So  urlLink here  is an interesting story.  I have to admit I find it really sad.  I mean, these stores are open only because they can't prove these stores are selling pretty much only to the reservation where it's illegal to take beer in?  16 people and 11,000 beer cans per DAY?  Since I'm pretty sure 650 cans per person is a fatal dose in a 24-hour period, I can't help but feel they should shut them all down.  I mean, 50 per person per day is well above sane.  It's blatantly for illegal purposes...  And yet bills to close them down haven't made progress.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I'm just really bitter this morning.  My face hurts.

      So the weekend's over, and I'm feeling highly productive.   Over the last couple of days, my wife and I between us mowed the lawn, trimmed the edges (of the lawn, natch), painted the spare room twice, did five loads of dishes and four loads of laundry, folded all the above-mentioned laundry, cleaned off the dining room table (which had a bunch of crap on it), cleaned the guinea pigs' cage, and a few other random chore-ey things.  It's nice to have felt like I (we) actually accomplished something for once, since I so often feel that I'm just being too lazy.  Maybe tonight I'll be brave and get around to cleaning my office...  Or at least get a few more steps into doing so.  Ever since my computer moved out of my office, my motivation for cleaning it has been approximately nil.  Very sad, really.  But eventually I'll clean it.  After all, if it gets too bad, it'd cut off access to my board games - they're in my closet in the back of that room.  I'm getting very nervous about this Friday.  I don't know why, but the idea of having someone put me under and pull out two teeth is really just starting to freak me out.  I've been told over and over again that it's not a big deal and such, and logically I know that, but logic isn't often very comforting.  I think it actually bugs me more, though, that my wife's friend is coming over that evening for the weekend - I'm expecting to pretty much be semi-conscious or unconscious from Friday lunchtime until Saturday evening, and the idea of her friend being there for the entire time bothers me.  She really doesn't seem to care.  Sometimes, I wish she'd be a little more sensitive - I don't want to ask her out-right, but she's ignored my comments that I'm not comfortable with it with her catch-all "What difference does it make?  You'll be asleep."  That really isn't the point, and I wish she'd notice.  So I'm still trying to figure out what to do tonight.  I think I might just end up playing Mechwarrior 4: Mercs for a while.  I'll do some cleaning, and I'm going to be grilling burgers, but that should still leave time to amuse myself by shooting helpless little 'Mechs.  Mmmm, shooting helpless little 'Mechs...  Anyway.  I'd like to say, for the record, as much as I may be no good at it, I really do enjoy writing, sometimes.  Bad grammar included.  My short story over at  HMP  is a good distraction for me.  It's gotten good reviews from the various posters there, so far...  But then, some things I think are absolute crap have gotten good reviews from the same posters.  I shouldn't get too excited over it.  It's nice to get some vague form of validation on my efforts, though, y'know?  Ah, well.  Back to work, I suppose.
