      Just got through playing a game of manhunt, a stupid game of hide and seek at night but hey we have nothing better to do. Since we only had five people I had to be the designated Hider, meaning no matter what I was hiding. I have no problem with this because everyone says I'm the best hidder, but Im losing my touch latly. Before I could hide until they called it quits and told me to come out but now Im so paranoid I run before they know where I am which gives my position away. I blame them. I blame anyone that isnt me. Since I have hidden everywhere in the three designated yards, they now think to look there so if I hide there, I'm caught. So in a way it is my fault for letting them know my spots. This game sucked especially cause pat wouldnt leave me alone and kept following me where ever I went and making noise. We have to go from my house where we start, down the street to pats, into his woods, cut through the neibors yards and cross the street to my house silently without the other team seeing us to get to the spot.I helped him onto the roof and hid in the woods. I heard Chris H. coming so I started crawling out of the woods but my mistake, Neina is standing right there. I try to run for it but she does track for fun so I have no chance of getting away.  Tom hides in a tree but almost falls so his place is given away. The other team gives up and calls it so pat has to  come down. They decide to make it a designated seeker instead so now i spend the rest of the game chasing people. Well that sucks but I dont complain cause what can I do. I go wait for them to hide and then spend like an hour tracking them down. No luck. Turns out they were in the woods behind pats house which is illegal but since we didnt establish it before the game what can I say. I have to find them again but Neina wont leave tom. She decides she is going to hid with him. They run off before we can get them so either way we have to find them. Pat, who is supposed to be on the other team stays with us cause he is stupid and we try to find them. We dont try very hard cause we just went through this. Then they just randomly leave so I come in shower and now im doing this.Fun shit

      Why is it that everyone thinks that in my last year of High School, I am going to want to go to the school even more to stand around a room, pay a shit load of money for one day like it was a fuckin wedding, dance, and leave. Im already spending thiry or more hours a week there, why would I want to go more, see the same people I see all the time, now in expensive stuff so they dont wanna ruin it so they dont move much or go near anything that could get on it so it looks even more occward. And its just assumed we have to go. My brother just graduated and he didnt go to prom cause he agrees its bullshit. He didn't die. He didnt spontaniously combust becuase of it. The cops didnt hall him off to jail. NO. So why do I HAVE to go. Fuck prom.

      Cause the annoying rich jocks always get the girl in the end and treat her like shit when a nice guy like me ends up washing the fuckin jocks uniform. ANd unlike what I wish would happen or what should, Jocks even after school get an easy life. They either A: are attractive looking to women and gay men so they get deals as models and shitty actors based on just their looks, B get put in some fake position at their familys buisness so they dont have to work and get paid alot, C: go to collage because their rich daddies pay for it and they are hired because they have a degree in bullshit and dont get fired cause their boss is busy working on important shit or end up fuckin their boss to not get fired, or D, end up living at home borowing stuff from their hard working families and spend all their time geting hammered and going out with women they dont deserve.

      The first day of filming was a few days ago but i didnt have a blog then so im posting it now. I set up for the shot Scene One when they are playing poker around 12:00, made some calls making sure everyone was coming and then shit hit the fan. First, since one of the actors was working we could film until 2:30 so that was a set back since that only gave us a three hour window of time before one of them had to leave and since i already set up the scene i couldnt film without him or a scene he wasnt in. Then I called Muse and Watters, two more actors who were in the scene. Not home. Call again ten minuets later. No answer. I keep calling until we it was time but still nothing so I tried filming around it. Then my set starts falling apart. MOTHER FUCKER. I start filming around it, using close shots of all the people when they speak so u dont know people are missing. These friends of mine are doing my a favor, I know, but they blow ass as actors. If i had some fuckin money I could make a better movie but Im broke. I count down. Take One "Three, two, one..." Nothing. Dead Silence. No one even moves. They look at eachother and me and start laughing. They forgot when to come in.Take Two: same result. Take Three I just say "GO" and they start "acting". Scott tries acting but Chris and nick start laughing. Try again. Dame result. I make them go outside. They start pounding on the walls and screaming ans jumping infront of the windows ruining the shot even more. And Scott. Nice kid but FUCK! He reads like those programs on Microsoft Word that read what you write. Chris wispers his lines. Nick is trying to be Pachino. Nick is holding the script in the shot. Chris is looking the wron way. Chris reads the wrong line. Scott still cant act. NIck spills the poker money, etc. Basicly after X amount of time I got Zero usable footage and a low abttery on my camera. Nice work guys.

I keep calling until we it was time but still nothing so I tried filming around it. Then my set starts fallling apart. Its supposed to be a scene at night no i had to cover the windows to block light. Well the things wouldnt stayt in place so I said forget it and just went without it.Then, now with only three of the five in the scene I started filming. I count down "three, two, one..." nothing happens. No one says anything. They all look at me and break out laughing. They forgot when to come in. Try it again "three , two, one" again nothing then laughter again. Now, Take Three. I say Go, they start "acting". I get nothing but dead pan reading like those programs on Microsoft Word that can say what you write. OK scott, lets try this again. This time nick is holding the script in the fucking shot! Take Five. Chris is wispering his lines. Take Six. Scott starts reading and Chris and Nick crack up. Take Seven, again laughter. I tell them to wait outside until they stop laughing cause it is a close up shot of scott. They start baning on the windows and yelling  so I bring them back in.  After a few more minuets of laughter we get serious and film. NIck goes to put down the money and SPILLS IT EVERYWHERE!!!!Try again, looking the wrong way. Basiclly after three hours of shooting I got Zero usable film and a low battery on my camera. Im going to tear Kevin and Matt a new asshole when I see them.
