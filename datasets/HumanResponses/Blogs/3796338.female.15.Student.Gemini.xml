              um...hello? This is um...Fire Emerald..I don't know if its safe to use my name... and I'm....well,lost. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT ISN'T IT JESSICA???????????? At least I hope it's Jessica... the blog-thinngy didn't say who it was from...very inconvenient. So, now that I said that... Shall I write a random essay for you? .....I shall cleareth my mind and the topic shall appear *head is cleared* and the topic is....(Dramatic Pause) MARSHMALLOWs!!!! How do they make them, honestly? They're like miracle food, the way they're puffy and yet still chewable. I think white foods are weird, especially the ones that you can  cook and still stay white. I mean, when they dehydrate or water is mixes in,shouldn't they change color? Like turn yellow-ish or brown or gray? White socks, white paper,white walls.Everything ELSE changes color!  They change color whether they're fading or growing dirty!  Food that's white only changes color is if it rots or is dyed (ex.Easter Eggs) And who likes white food? It means no flavor! Like white rice, its nasty until you add the butter and then POOF  yellow + yummy. Marshmallows are good frozen, dipped in liquid nitrogen...Cool....I think I should go now....Look at how much I typed! I think I'll go steal some liquid nitrogen...or play with fire.       -  Fire Emerald

       Okay reading people this is actually a very important post. If any one is missing a dog anywhere PLEASE check at your local animal shelter. The cages a re overflowing here,if you're to lazy to buy a dog tag then maybe you need to realize that if it had a tag, it would be back home by now(thats painted on the shelter's truck). And for every dog that was brought another cage had to be cleared. The cages were full already and are full now. There is only two ways to clear a cage, adoption or death. Sorry if this is depressing but please people have a heart. Thank you, I hope.            -  Fire Emerald
