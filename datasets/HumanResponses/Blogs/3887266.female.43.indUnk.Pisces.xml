      i was a child, searching for the flower buried so far beneath. the petals soft, the color dep and complex flowing into clear simplicity. soiled, i searched with nieve hope and determination, my playful mind instinctively moving forward. there was nothing behind me to cause me to stumble. i kept digging with my bare hands, small delicate fingers strong and taught against the force.   i am an adult, hands weak and fingers raw. the flower has turned to stone, the color gray and cold. there is a web of pain before me, i am unable to free myself of     it's grasp.

      she had open eyes, supple skin.  her limbs moved easily and felt every sensation.  she could smell the wind and taste the rain. she could hear people walking with a quick stride, or languidly enjoying their short time in the sunshine.  she could feel the vibrations of the busy traffic and see red, green, and silver cars and trucks swooshing by.  bicycles with svelte riders in bright jerseys and space age helmets.  so much life to think about.  so much life to ponder.  the sky was sometimes gray and drizzling, sometimes a swift wind pushed wisps of clouds across the sky.  the nights were soft and cool..  it was so peaceful to be alone in this quiet arena.  the stars shown faintly, the streelights obscured their brightness.  the wind quieted to a bare whisper, which lulled her to sleep.    she withstood time with strength and instinctive fortitude.  years passed, and the world changed so slowly it ws barely perceptible.  she recoginized the changed in herself long before her surroundings.  her skin became mottled and cracked.  there were small peeling patches.  her limbs becames increasingly heavy as the cold winter wind was pushed away by the warm breezes of spring.  the trees burst into glorious bloom, but her eyes saw their color dulled and their shape faint.  she had trouble blinking and raising her hand to clear her eyes.  her eyelids feld heavy and rigid.  it was strange that it was so difficult to lift her hand to welcome her friend the bluebird for a rest.  the cars and busses rushed by with alarming speed, making her feel unsafe.  the sky seemed always to be filled with thick white clouds, which turned dark and gray on the horizon.  the rain pinched her skin.  the wind made her cold and lonely.  where were all the people she had seen so many times before?  she couldn't feel the life around her.  she wanted to walk away to see if the sensation and life would return to her body.  her legs were filled with lead and fatigue.  she couldn't move.  she couldn't look for  different world, a world she could remember, a world she had not  noticed had changed so subtly that she was excluded from it's hopeful destiny.  why?  with much difficulty she lowered her eyes to see herself.  she had become a statue.
