      why the hell can't I get a damn doctor or dentist&nbsp;appointment withing this century.&nbsp; Is there this much of a shortage of doctors.&nbsp; I have serious&nbsp;problems here (but not enough of an emergency to call an ambulance) and nobody can see me because they are all booked till november or some crap.&nbsp;   Now that I got that out... first entry in this log just so happened to be after calling multiple doctors and dentists to find that we seem to have a shortage of them.  Well, I gotta get back to work now... setting up this blog was my waiting on hold task... time for some real work.

      My boss has this rule about being late for work... don't be.  One minute late warrents a call to him to tell him you will be one minute late for work.  I once got yelled at for being 4 minutes late to work... I come from a different world than this.   My older boss' at the same company didn't know what "late" meant unless it was for a meeting.  I work on the road a lot, and there it's do your work till you are done, like my 24 hour day of work the other week.  Where my old boss' knew this and considered it fine to do what we like when we are in the office (I used to get in between 9 and noon, and leave between 1 and 5... sometimes being from noon to 1pm).  Now I get ripped from that into a 9am start time... and here is the kicker... I still have to work till my work is done so it's not 9 to 5... it's 9 till done as long as done comes at 6 or after.  I don't understand this frame of thinking.  I need some flexibility in my time when i'm at work in the office considering I have long hours every time i'm on the road, I don't think it's too much to ask for... but the boss says no.  Well i'm rambling a lot... basically I was pretty damn late today and even though I was doing work from home my boss still had a "talk" with me about alarm clocks and asked me if I was doing smack last night and the such.  Luckily he can't get rid of me right now because i'm too valuable an asset.  Who thinks I should just f with him and come in late all the time to see if I can cross the line?  PS still haven't done any work that I couldn't have done from home yet.
