      Hello,  Welcome to the beginning. I hope you will stay till the end.   To begin, allow me to direct your attention to a riddle.    A man walks up to you and says - "everything I say to you is a lie." Is he telling you the truth or is he lying?    What do you think?

      After more than two years, saying goodbye is not exactly that easy. First of all, there is that letter to write. Lucky me, I found a wonderful online resource that provides templates for various tone: "Simple, friendly and courteous"/ "Formal and straight to the point"/ "Short and sweet"/ "... with a touch of gratitude". Take a pick. Mix, match, cut and paste. Ah, the art of it.  &nbsp;  Secondly, walking up to your boss and handling him the white envelope. Be prepared for what he has to say. And be prepared for what you got to say.  &nbsp;  "Don't tell me you're quitting."  "Err... Yes?"  &nbsp;  Next, breaking the news to your colleagues. "What?" "Hah!" "Oh but why?"  &nbsp;  After all that, you go back to your little cubicle, that pile of work and&nbsp;yesterday's deadline and you stare at your computer screen trying to figure out where to begin and how to end. So it was like that for a few days.  &nbsp;  After you have sobered up from the effects of&nbsp;THE decision, you then begin to wonder how you are going to pack all your stuff into a taxi. And&nbsp;after you've managed to&nbsp;transport home&nbsp;all those documents (all the saucy celebrity news&nbsp;you printed out 11 months ago), free magazines you collected from&nbsp;Starbucks and souvenirs from press conferences (a tin of crayons?), you would be wondering where you're going to&nbsp;store them.&nbsp;There are still a few&nbsp;more boxes to go.  &nbsp;  And at the same time you're&nbsp;struggling with these trivial issues, you're juggling a challenging FINAL deadline and making excuses to plan&nbsp;a list of recreational activities (paint the wall? start a herb garden? be a part-time baby-sitter?) for the coming weeks when you would no longer have to&nbsp;rise at the beep of that annoying alarm clock.  &nbsp;  Until the new job begins, that is. Here I go...

       Kenny T said:  It's the truth because he's lying about the lie!   Ju said:  Is he good looking?   Nev said:  He is telling the truth by lying... therefore he is infact telling the truth.   Kelsi said:  The speaker must be an artist to come up with something so profound. and since we all know artists are weird and a little insane creatures, i refuse to participate in this riddle shananigan.   The answer, my dear, is...     He's lying!   Even though he's lying when he says "everything" he says is a lie, some of the things he says can be a lie, and this is one of them.   Errr... go figure.  So, why do the chickens cross the road?  Just kidding!

      2 websites, 3  urlLink livejournals , 1  urlLink blogger , 2  urlLink opendiarys  and 1 greymatter later, I'm still stuck with that problem. Online journal, digital diary, blogging... whatever you call it, they are not new to me. I have poured my heart out, performed mental puke and spilled the naked truth online longer than I have been writing for the monthly wage. If Kiwi was still alive today, she would gladly testify to that. Meow.   So, I don't know where to start!  Do I start with a "Hello" and a "Welcome"? Or do I break the ice with a riddle?   Hee.   As I am crawling through this post, my neighbour has already  urlLink whipped a storm  and confessed to the World Wide Web her willingness to turn lesbian for Keira Knightley.   Elsewhere, my very supportive, absolutely wonderful friend replied my first post on this blog with three comments within 10 minutes, two out of which are advertisements for his own blog. For an extra RM10 and a glass of teh tarik, I would personally recommend it.  urlLink Go hear him bitch . It's a good read. Seriously.   Who else would like to buy me teh tarik?  Now, excuse me while I learn the art of photo blogging so that I can soon enough, let the pictures speak the thousand words.   And like they say on TV,   the answer to the riddle after the break!

      Let me say that again. Three weeks, home alone and no life. Except for the reality on TV. So yes, that was what I did. I watched 'em all. Even drew little circles on my TV Guide as a reminder. What a life you can find with just a remote control.  The synopsis so far? It's down to two for the ape-looking (apparently) Bachelor. I hate the show but I love watching it for the burning eyelashes, bitchy stares and how women collectively handle being dumped by one ape at the same time. Who's the unlucky bride? Certainly not Uma Thurman, ape! A few couples Raced to the Altar and provided some senseless entertainment. Ah well, hate the bride; didn't think she deserves that 'dream' wedding. Fear Factor is still Fear Factor. And so is the Amazing Race.  There's a new reality show called the Next Action Star. There's an ill-fitted pornstar potential by the name of Viviana (even the name!) who scored (no puns intended) with the judges and got called back. In the name of good reality TV, I would say it was a good call, even if channel surfers who stumbled upon the show mistaken it for the Next Porn Star. She did an intentional, public breasts-fondle in an episode. Get-tit?  My TV Guide says the Newlyweds is on tonight. Can't wait to watch Jessica Simpson plays dumb. Oh wait, maybe she's not faking it.
