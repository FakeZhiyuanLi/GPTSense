      So some times I have the best luck and the worst luck.  As in my profile, I am drawn to some of the new technology.  In addition, I have lived with an addage that has been a detriment to my wallet.  Nice things aren't cheap and cheap things aren't nice.  I consider myself an intelligent person but I pulled a boner that has ruined my eBay experience forever.  And if anyone reads this don't use those auction services.  Pay a little more and find what you need a retail store.  Much safer.  So here is my story.  Laugh if you will many have.  But learn a lesson if nothing else.  The ebay user had a lot of great feedback.  I had been watching certain cell phones I knew I could get this particular on only in Europe.  The user was selling multiple phones and I thought I could get a deal if I purchased more then one and give one to a friend.  The auction was reserved and you needed to email the seller to even bid.  Once we started talking he wanted to do the transaction outside of ebay and would give me a bigger deal if I sent the money and if he did not have to pay ebay.  I sent the money and did not hear back.  Finally a few days later he then asked for more money saying he accidently sent me a couple of more phones.  I then asked for some confirmation the phones were sent and that is the last I heard after repeatedly following up.  This user continues to try and sell these Aston Martin V600 phones on ebay and I am sure is ripping people off left and right.  Ebay of course says they have no liability even thought it appears a users id was stolen.

      So, this is the first of hopefully many blogs.  Yes, I am a newbie and still figuring out what can I bring to the public with my stream of consciousness and bad grammer.  Nothing of any importance of course, but I will ramble away anyways.  With that said, lets see if we can find something to post here.  My interests are as follows.  I dig techie things and work somewhat in the industry.  Into sports etc and a Cubs fan like most of the fun Chicagoans.  Into movies and software development.  What I will bring to the world in this forum is a little of all of those.

      Here is what I need.  This is a calling to all my geeky friends that I have never meet nor want to meet.  Challenge.  I want someone to do a senior thesis on traffic in Chicago.  For those who believe in the patterns in day to day life, there has to be one here.  To all those who spend 23 hours in front of their computer (I only spend 19 hours and do not have the time) put your heads together and based on all the possible variables map out traffic for the next month.  Weathermen do it.  We are smarter and maybe not better looking but hell they are always wrong anyways.  I know no one reads this blog of mine, but if you consider my challenge.  I am offer a great prize if you can figure this out.  I big huge thank you in an email.  Keep me up to date.
