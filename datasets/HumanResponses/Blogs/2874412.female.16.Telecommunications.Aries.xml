      Buckle up for what im guessing is going to be a long blog.  "nicola you're so gross!"-i got told that about 394832947319 times one ONE bus ride.  "wanna do me a favour?"-me "ok"-small chinese boy "wanna be my friend?-me "GOD NO!"-small chinese boy  ...screw quotes i have so many fuck ass funny stories.  ...so i was in missasuage last night adn all day today singing. the singing part sucked but the other stuff was fucking hilarious. i had a grand time. here goes nothing...  ...first off. HOLYCOCK! tehre was a kid there and his name was kyle holycock. i wanted his name tag. me and mary were obsessed with this. so during dinner i went up to him with mary and asked him if we could trade name tags. he said no. so i just took it. and gave him mine. well apprenetly nicola isnt a good enough name for him cause he came over to my table to give me it back. well i felt bad cause he actuallyl seemed really said that i took his name tag so i went to go give it back but him and his two friends(by the way they were like 10) but they started to walk,very quickly too. so i went faster. and than he ran. and NATURALLY, i ran after him. two full tables of my hommies were all laughing so hard at me. and when i finally got to him and gaev it back he threw it on the ground and said "it's not good anymore" and i said "ok so can i keep it?" and he said no! and when ireturned to the cafe i got a round of appluase from a few tables. and than the lunchladies  talked about the nick-o-la girl. bitznits.wow long story.  ...the school we were at was VERY scary. me,lindsay,lisa,mary and leanne planned a whole horror movie. it is actually really good and scary too. we were walking around the school and they have these two statue type things(one black with a hood and one white) climbing up the walls. we all screamed and ran,of course. and than we went exploring the halls and we screamed..i lost count how many times but it was a lot. probably close to 3948249032.  ...i think i lost a few friends on the bus ride home. im sick and dirty minded and they are not used to that and so yah..didnt go down too well. p.s never EVER sit on top of a fridge with a broom..oh god..CURLING IRON. ouch..  ...there was a boy around my age on the bus. we werent sure what he was doing there,but didnt care cause he was pretty damn cute. so when we were getting on to go home i asked him and he was the bus driver's son. his dad was there too. family vacation :)  ...HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHN! he's cool. it's his 11th birthday. John, you are an amazing dancer.   ...im going to leave because that is long nad im way too tired from singing to think anymore.  Pickles.  NICOLA.

"let's all pretend to haev seizures and then run!"-my idea. alanna and breanna didnt really have ideas.   ...well after all our fun planning we got up and went in line to pay.and than staci walked out. i followed. we just stoof there waiting and than finally we see alanna and bish come running out. haha. we=rule. we got a free lunch. dont you wish you were us? i do.  ...i ran into my math teacher in the hall...the first time she said hi. the second time she decided to ask me where i was instead of being in her class. i dont like her. she's fat and had a SUPER HIGH PITCHED VOICE LIKE THIS and smells like bad bad bad b.o. im done.  ...i went to alannas last night to 'rip some shit' and it was awesome. and smelly. we've got a few songs we're learning. i love it. we're actually doing stuff not just talking about it. cheers.  kiss my ass i hope you like the taste.

      Watch you're back blockbuster.  ...i have the worst luck. kay this is my little rant for today. i rented 'cheap by the dozen' on the weekend as most of you fans(?) know. well it was due back monday morning by 10 but since i took it to stacis the night before, it did not get returned. but if i told my parents that than id end up getting in trouble because they are gay. so i thought and thought of how i can take it back without them knowing. so today after school when i was walking home i went out of my way to take it back. well the fucking late fee was $8.76. what a jip. that's more than the movie cost in the first place. and than i get home to find out that blockbuster had called my house that day and left a messege saying it was late. so my parents found out anyways. i suck.  ...so now that ive got that out. the rest of my day was okay. civics seems okay. math is still...math. lunch was okay.the usual. "pull my finger". but than i had history. that fucker...  ...see,today in history we got a work period and we could listen to music. well the fucking guy who sits beside me(jason oke who's locker we put gum on) well yes this fucker decided to blast his techno. i was getting a little mad. but than as i was writing a note to staci he starts reading it. so in the note i wrote things such as 'fucker beside me stop reading this and die' and he started making grounting noises. could he get more annoying? YES! he stated to tap his pen along to his techno. that bastard. i was seriously about to kick his ass when i noticed there were 3 minutes left of class. so i got up and left before i lost control of my fist. well 'fist'. people say my fist is not a real fist :(  ...wow lots of ranting today. ohh i got more.  ...in gym we were talking about body image and shit like that. and a 'certain someone' who i wont name was pissing the whole class off. and to make it worse her ass was hanging out of the back of her pants. she just goes on and on arguing with everyone about everything. reminder to self :kill her and jason oke. and blockbuster.  ...and im spent. no more ranting for me.  ...GUESS WHAT! there is a BRAND NEW o.c on tonight. i am uncontrolably excited. im going to piss myself just thiking about it. but oh course, my brother went to paiges to watch it so im once again left alone to watch it :(. my mummy said i should've gone to her house with him and sit inbetween them. i laughed. and than said no.  ...chris body checked me today in the halls and i went flying. ill get you chris, watch your back buddy. and he's making a movie and he said that in it me and graham smith are a couple but than i find out he's cheating on me with the janitor(who is staci) but in the end he comes crying back for me. lucky me.  ...i am sweet and innocent looking. according to cody. so i asked peple. they agree. im not sure if this is bad or good but i dont really care because it means nothing to me i guess. and dylan says im tiny and like a little kid and that my 'michevious' smile is cool. he says it's my drunken smile...since when has dylan seen me drunk....ahahahha. hi. leave me alone.  lets ditch this joint.

SOOO boring. i sat beside this chinese women and im sure she wanted to smack me because i was so annoying. i didnt sit still for than than .45 seconds. sheesh i get bored easily.  ...enough typing. if you're still reading this i applaude you for sticking in there.  peace hommie.

Fun Sunday: --i got my parents to drop me off at staci's on the way home. than we went to erins party. woot. --first it was just a bunch of people kindof sitting around. me and staci were handcuffed. than we spiked some pop, watched some group x videos. extremely funny. --walked to hasty,bought colts and fireworks,smoked colts and set off fireworks, had to borrow a lighter from some grade 9's having a party. started raining so we went inside. toked up at their house*stupid grade 9's thought we paid haha)than back to erin's. -a bunch more people came so erins mom said people had to leave so a bunch of us went to kirsty's. we smoked it up some more there. until her brother too a spaz and me and staci ran out of there back to erins. --me,staci,erin,cailey and steve hung out for a bit at erins. steve did this amazing this with fire and a popcan. than cailey and steve left. --staci listened to music/slept while me and erin set fire to things, SO MUCH FUN> we set the smoke alarm off. hahahaa. --than me and erin had to walk to kristy's at 2 in the morning to egt staci's bag which she forgot there and it was sooo fucking scary walking there. it was all fog and dark and nicola gets scared so fucking easily.but we got it and returned safely. only getting raped 7.4 times.  Monday: --got home from erins at like 11:15ish. did chores. had a shower. ps. the bathroom STILL smells like colts. haha im a dumbass. --so far im not doing anything. im suppose to hang out with josh but he's working right now i think. --i have my first soccer game tonight, i really dont want to go. i think im going to fake sick.  good-bye and so long.

      Boredness is taking over.  ...im bored and i remembered some stuff i forgot to update you all on. so here goes nothing.  ...staci came into my math class thursday. it was great fun. actually no, it was mostly boring. and a stupid someone decided to leave the class. they were the reason i went to class. but we found out we have the same supply on friday so...  ...staci came back on friday. it was a lot of fun. we hung out with olivia, jessica, patrick and jeff. there was a huge bumblebee which i thought looked like a bird. it was HUGE okay! and olivia got up and ran out of the classroom. jeff caught it though, in patricks tupaware container. i love. it was hilarious.  ...about the whole my parents going away on my 24 and me staying at staci's. well yah. now i have to go with them. it'll super suck. they're reasons why i should go: 1) there'll be horseback riding(cause you know how i ride horses?) 2) there's a spa(this idea kindof scares me actually) 3) it's family time(yet my brother isnt going and my dad has told me he doesnt consider my part of the family) 4) who cares 5) to get away from home/guelph for a night(but ill be going to staci's, which is in arkell!)   ...so yah,if i end up having to go it'll suck. and to make it worse i found out that my parents will be spending the night out alone so ill have to babysit my sister. in a hotel room. oh i cant wait...  ...no one is coming back to choir. but i want to. im such a loser but i love it! and ive been in it 8 years. i dont want to give up now. but it'll be no fun with no one there, at least no one over the age of 12. ack it sucks.please come back:laura,lindsay,mary,leanne,tanya,vanessa,victoria,lisa. PLEASE!  ...ive noticed something. correct me if im wrong. but ive noticed that lots of my friends make fun of/hate certain groups of people. people complain that these other groups are so stupid or annoying. but they're really no different than us when you think about it. take gangsters for example. people find them annoying cause they: -listen to rap/hip hop -guys wear huge clothes -girls wear  no  clothes -they're loud and talk funny -ect. but we're really no different. my friends mostly listen to the same music, mostly wear the same brands in clothes, have our own language at times. and i honestly think the other 'groups' of people find my friends and me annoying/hate as much as we do with them. people need to learn to stop labeling and judging people just because of who they hang out with and what type of things they like. especially a certain dad*cough mr.???? cough*  ...so yah this is a long penis and i dont feel like writing anymore. farewell.  lets end this madness and split.

      I HAVE A FUNNY JOKE! props to lindsay fortelling me it.  there are 3 men stranded on an island when a group of cannibals come to them. the king cannibals says to the frist guy "go and gather 10 pieces of fruit" so he goes and comes back with 10 apples. the king says "if you can shove those 10 apples up your ass without making a face or a noise we wont eat you".so he shoves one apple up his ass no problem but after the second apple he says "ow" and so they eat him. they say the same thing to the second guy and he comes back with 10 grapes. he starts shoving them up his ass and while he's on the ninth one he laughs. so they eat him. up in heaven the first guy says to the second guy "why did you laugh!? you only had one grape left!" and the second guy replies "i know, but i saw the third guy coming back with PINEAPPLES!"   ahahahahahahaha i love it.

      Im super bored. so here are some amusing stories for you to read.   Pubic Grass     A nurse was on duty in the Emergency Room, when a young woman with purple hair styled into a punk rocker Mohawk, sporting a variety of tattoos, and wearing strange clothing, entered.   It was quickly determined that the patient had acute appendicitis, so she was scheduled for immediate surgery. When she was completely disrobed on the operating table, the staff noticed that her pubic hair had been dyed green, and above it there was a tattoo that read, "Keep off the grass."   Once the surgery was completed, the surgeon wrote a short note on the  patient's dressing, which said, "Sorry, had to mow the lawn."     He said, She said     1. He said....I don't know why you wear a bra; you've got nothing to put in it. She said... You wear pants don't you?    2. He said...Shall we try swapping positions tonight? She said...That's a good idea - you stand by the ironing board while I sit on the sofa and fart!   3. He said...What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you? She said...Turn sideways and look in the mirror!   4. He said....Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm? She said...I would but you are never there.   Nine months later     John decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They loaded up John's mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.   "I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I've just been recently widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house."   "Don't worry," John said. "We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light."   The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.   About nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from some lawyer.   It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it had to be the attorney of that attractive widow he and Bob had met on the ski weekend. He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed in on our ski holiday up North?"   "Yes, I do." said Bob   "Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit ?"   "Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to admit that I did."   "And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?"   Bob's face turned beet red and he said rather embarrasedly, "Yeah, I'm afraid I did. . . .I am really sorry, buddy. . . ."   After several minutes of silence, Bob finally asked, "Why do you ask?"   "Well, she just died, and left me everything."  (And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)    over and out.  NICOLA.

      So sue me.  "SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"-everyone at josh's surprise party. "what the hell..my birthday is in 2 weeks..you moved my drums?! oh my god. how did you get here(*said to me*)??..and who invited rob?"-josh's response.  "breanna is such a homosexual"-me. meaning to say homophobic. "hahahahahahhhah"-me and staci for '8 years'.   Saturday, June 26, 2004.   well,this was the grand ol' day of josh cousteils surprise party.   it all started 2 weeks ago when i got a call from his mother saying that she was interested in hosting a surprise party for her son's 16th birthday. she wanted me to be her partner in crime. of course i agreed.  for the next 2 weeks she called me at least everyother day, and even came to my crib to discuss the plans.   the day finally came for the big surprise party. and it was up to me to keep the victim out of the house all afternoon, and than bring him back for the surprise.  my plan was to bring josh to a family bbq and hang out there until 6:30 when i would ask him if we could go to his house due to boredom at the bbq.  well,so far,all went as planned. we went to the bbq. i must say it was EXTREMELY boring as we basicully just sat there for about 3.5 hours in the same spot not doing anything. until 6:30 came around, when i asked him if we could go to his house to hang out. his response SHOULD have been "yes". but instead he replied "well can you just drop me off at home cause i think im hanging out with my brother tonight".   i couldnt say no or make it obviously i HAD to go. so i just agreed.  so my mother drove us to his house, and he got out and we bid farewell. but as soon as the van doors closed and josh was in the house...i was almost in tears. i thought i was going to miss the big surprise i had been planning.  but at that moment, before i shed a tear, his father comes running outside and waved me to come in.  josh had gone to the washroom.   i quickly ran inside and was practically thrown into the basement by his brother. i knew that when the 15 people downstairs saw me come down, they might yell surprise. but by luck, all that happened was rob's "hurray".  i quickly got seated in the dark and awaited josh's entrence.  the basement door openned.  footsteps were heard.  and finally...  *fart*  (haha kidding)  SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  then josh's unexpected response.  the night was fun. watched tv/movies, went to the park and had fun watching the boys on the swings.  staci and myself had bought a cake with a picture of josh picking his nose on it that said "happy 7th birthday josh". he loved it. i wish i got to try it though...  and that, was the event i had been secretly planning for 2 weeks. and by secretly..i mean josh didnt know. he had no idea. probably because his birthday isnt until july 13. but meh. it was still grand.  the end.  true story.  these songs of praise i'll never endure.

DUN DUN DUN  the skateboard breaks. OH NO!(sorry ryan)  BUT  never fear. the fun does not stop here. it's only beginning.  so at this point, we are left with 3 idiots, and a couch. and a broken skateboard. we put the wheels of the skateboard in such a way that we could still push the couch somewhat. but it was not as fun.  SO. we had the amazing idea of...putting the couch..(wait for it..)  ON THE ROOF!  zach got up first. and josh pushed the from the bottem, and i got stuck in the fense. it was a team effort but we FINALLY got that couch on the roof.  than after me needing much assistance to get on the roof myself, we sat, and simply chilled on our new love.(that zach says smells like someone just had sex with 8 cats on it)  we were soon joined by alex falacy(can not spell name) and his friends greg,simon and shannon. the story pauses for the next 20 minutes because during this time i was not included. me and zach sat on the couch while josh talked to his old buddies about good times.  so back to the story.  after chilling there for a while longer, the story comes to an end. we left the couch(which is STILL there)and returned to josh's to eat lots of pizza.  the end.

There's things that you guess And things that you know There's boys that you can trust And girls that you don't There's little things you hide And little things that you show Sometimes you think you're gonna get it But you don't and that's just the way it goes  I swear I won't tease you Won't tell you no lies I don't need no bible Just look in my eyes I've waited so long baby Now that we're friends Every man's got his patience And here's where mine ends   I want your sex I want you I want your.....sex   It's playing on my mind It's dancing on my soul It's taken so much time So why don't you just let me go I'd really like to try Oh, I'd really love to know When you tell me you're gonna regret it Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!  I swear I won't tease you Won't tell you no lies I don't need no bible Just look in my eyes I've waited so long baby Out in the cold I can't take much more girl I'm losing control   I want your sex I want your love I want your.....sex   It's natural It's chemical (let's do it) It's logical Habitual (can we do it?) It's sensual But most of all..... Sex is something that we should do Sex is something for me and you  Sex is natural - sex is good Not everybody does it But everybody should Sex is natural - sex is fun Sex is best when it's....one on one One on one  I'm not your father I'm not your brother Talk to your sister I am a lover   C-c-c-c-come on   What's your definition of dirty baby What do you consider pornography Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby Don't you think it's time you had sex with me  Sex with me Sex with me Have sex with me   C-c-c-c-come on.

      craZy.  ...how's it goin peeps?  ...the days seem so long lately. i kinda like it, more fun. yet more pain?  ...i did  this thing where you type in your name and it tells you when you will die and from what. and it said im going to die at the age of 48 from starvation.  ...matchbox20=my new favourite band. for right now. matthew good band is not far behind. just incase you were wondering..  ...the past couple of days have been a blurr.wanna know why? well too bad. cause i cant answer that question.   ...i hate getting older. i wish i was still 5 years old and running around naked in the mud with the indians. life used to be so much fun and easy. now we actually have to try to live and stay alive.  ...my brother said that my parent think i've been smoking in the house again, but i HAVENT. and im not lying this time.  ...me and staci tried making up our own language since the gangsters made up theirs. it didnt really work. but it was a  good effort.  ...today kayla went up and pulled back the curtin in the cafe and bangedt he window at an old man painting the winder, she thought it was mike. it was super funny. than when he came inside she said "im sorry, if you had a heart-attack i would've gone to your funeral" haha funny kayla.  ...my stomach hurts. ate too much after school, or maybe it's something else...  ...i can beat josh in tony hawk. up yours.  ...last night i went driving for the first time on the roads, i went alone stone rd. and edinburogh and such. very busy roads. driving is fun and i am p-r-o.  letters of pain bring tears to my eyes.  NICOLA.   (song of the day=3AM by matchbox 20)  p.s-let's never do this again staci, im so sorry.

       welllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll   hi   it's   5:28AM.     and why am i still up?   because there are NOOOOOOOO blankets.   therefore it's too cold to sleep.     im really smart.     i havent been able to sleep more then 2 hours the past week.     making me exxxtremely tired.     so what do i do?     [being the smart person i am]     i dont sleep     AT ALL.      i have been playing solitare      and talking to staci     since 12.     ahh.     time went by slow.   yet fast.   im too tired to pick one.   you choose for me.      SO .tomorrow i am either going to be     extremely hyper     or extremely tired.     and im hanging out with josh.     sorry bud.     tonight me and staci seduced garth.   he loved it.   [ps staci,i left those panties at your house for that reason]     saturday night staci's having a bonfire.     lots of people.     people we dont know.     her parents     and brothers     friends.     so we decided to join in.   we're inviting zach and josh.   and we're going to trick them into eating veggie burgers.   [shh dont tell them]    will.be.a.blast .[off]     so ANYWAYS. staci has gone offline.    and i will be too soon.   mum will be getting up soon.   and i have nothing left to do on the internet.   except play more solitare.   slash look at porn.    i am super hungry.   and thursty.   but i can not go upstairs.   [unless i want to get murdered]     my eyes are screaming at me.     this isnt the first time i've stayed up all night.   it's just the first time i've done it alone   and stared at a computer screen for 5.5 hours.     dont try it.     so i shall leave.    see if there is anything good on tv.   [im highly doubting that.]     see you down the road.      .N  I  C O  L   A.

        This letter explains everything.The content it is the truth.Each word could cut like daggers if I decide to finally give it to you.I've rewrote and rechecked a thousand times.Licked it shut and said my goodbyes.The lines are perfectly written to break wide open this conclusion.       &nbsp;  since my computer has decided to be oh-so slow just to piss me off,i will make this short.    &nbsp;  i have nothing really to say anyways.    &nbsp;  so today-did nothing [surprise?i think not] and then bishnew came over.and we headed to the mall because i wanted dessert.    &nbsp;  i bought a checkered belt. saweetness.    &nbsp;  at home i put on just about every piece of clothing i own.it was hot.and my parents thought i was on drugs.but it was well worth it my friend.    &nbsp;  and now im watching my brother and paige make babies on the pull-out couch.the one that i have to sleep on tonight. oh goody.    &nbsp;  and this,is me leaving.    &nbsp;  i'll bleed like a rose plucked from the earth.

       hi sweetie.    &nbsp;  well today was a barrel of fun:   1.woke up[obviously nicola]   2.watched tv   3.washed the bathroom   4.had a shower   5.got dressed   6.msn   7.watched 'my baby's daddy'   8.din din   9.washed bathroom again   10.msn   11.blogging    &nbsp;  life doesnt get much more exciting then this. [it's kindof sad because im not really joking.my life isnt much more exciting then this.]    &nbsp;  im wearing my sisters sunglasses. they're like 'emo' glasses with red lenses. they're making me kindof sleepy.    &nbsp;  speaking of sleepy. i havent been feeling all that well lately. it could be from the lack of sleep i've been getting lately.    &nbsp;  i was suppose to go to staci's tonight to have sex. but she never called me when she got home from work. i talked to her brother and he said she was sleeping/not feeling well. feel better soon lover.    &nbsp;  i really need to do something/go someone this week. i have had no life this summer.i babysat the last 3 weeks. the most i've done all summer is gone to the movies. which is really just a waste of money. money that i really dont have to waste.so now i have no money.no friends .no life. n-o-t-h-i-n-g.dont try this at home kids.    &nbsp;  im giving up on everything because you messed it up.dont know how much you screwed it up.you never listened,that's just too bad.im moving on.i wont forget you were the one that was wrong.i need to stand up and be strong.dont patronize me.    &nbsp;  my dad can suck a dick.i spent an hour washing the bathroom today and then tonight he decided that since i forgot to empty the garbage i had to clean the whole bathroom all over again. [asshole]    &nbsp;  so now i sit here,eating nacho's and cheese.alone.not even bothering to be on msn because no one online wants to talk to me anyways.    &nbsp;  so sorry i wasted your time. i wont bother you any longer.    &nbsp;  my eyes cant hide from you haunting glare.

       Be Gone.    &nbsp;  I have come to the conclusion that it must be really annoying to watch a movie with me. I have realized i get way to into the movie. sometimes. usually not with funny movies. but with other types. such as when i watched free willy a few nights ago with josh. holy i got excited when the whale jumped over the rocks. and i noticed it again last night, while watching    S P I D E R M A N    2    [amazing movie]     &nbsp; here are some quotes from it. [  me ] [  bishnew  ]   she can be like spiderWOMEN!   yeah!and they can get married and then   MAKE SPIDER BABIES!    &nbsp;  AHHH i know what's going to happen! wait wait...it's coming.want me to tell you?   no   okay fine. ahhhh i know....IM SO SMART! im so good at this predicting game...wait for it..here it comes!   *my prediction was wrong*   oh..that wasnt suppose to happen.   hahahahaha you suck.    &nbsp;  *peter parker returns to being spideman once again*   YES!   ...    &nbsp;  well yeah you get the picture.    we were suppose to go and see The Notebook, but it doesnt play on friday's...    &nbsp;  saw mike and kirsten. her tattoo is   SO SUPER COOL!   and mike even paid for her ticket...    hey matt!-mike   hey man-matt   hhaha it must look funny, you hanging out with a bunch of  chicks -kisten   WRONG! 2 chicks and  nicola .-me   yeah.nicola's not a chick.she's a man.-mike   am not. im just not a chick.-me   nah you're cool nicola. here, shake my hand.-mike   *shake hands*   you've gotta get a tighter grip if you're a man-mike   im not a man!-me    &nbsp;   who knows what could happen

       I can be as angry as I want to be. Just watch me burn. I think you're way too cold. Just watch and learn. I'll never sleep here anymore. My house is not my home. I like you better dead. And I'm better off alone. Destiny, will you cure me? Trust, will you age with me? Hear me scream. Destiny, will you cure me? Hear me scream as I face tomorrow. Your vision may be in colour, but you look all pale. In these times we should be learning, but with you I'll always fail. Destiny, will you cure me? Trust, will you age with me? Hear me scream. Destiny, will you cure me? Hear me scream as I face tomorrow. I need to save myself before I drown. It took so long to see.The world your mind creates. It pushes me under. Destiny, will you cure me? Trust, will you age with me? Hear me scream. Destiny, will you cure me? Hear me scream as I face tomorrow.

      This is not funny in many ways-but im posting it anyways.   Top 10 Worst Responses If Someone Tells You They Have Cancer     10. Other than that, how's it going.    9. This isn't going to affect my career, is it?    8. I guess there's no need to quit smoking now.    7. There are easier ways to build character, you know.    6. Oh, my aunt/cousin/grandfather died of that same cancer!    5. Be sure to wear clean underwear.    4. Just think of all the money you'll save on shampoo.    3. Cancer...is that before or after Aquarius?    2. Yeah, right, whatever.    1. It's always about you, isn't it?   remember when you always said i'd be the one to run away?well im still here and where are you?  NICOLA.

       This blog is an apology.  I would just like to say sorry.  to everyone.  even if they dont read this.   im sorry.   for all of my complaints and problems i've laid upon you. You dont deserve to have to suffer simply because i am. I shouldn't even have reasons  to be whining like i do. my life is perfect. right? staci is an amazing best friend, josh is an incredible boyfriend, my mum rocks, my marks arent even that bad. It's not like im an abandoned orphan, or a wife too scared to leave her abusive husband, or a starving child in Asia with no one at all, or a wife getting burned in afganastan, or a homeless man just trying to get lunch, or a patient in the hospital dying from cancer, or a mentally ill child, or a struggaling drug addict. But dont get me wrong, these arent the only people who have problems worthy enough to complain about. Everyone does. Just some are more serious then mine. A lot more serious. I'm just going to rememeber that next time i go to rethink my life, and think about perhaps hurting myself, or even worse, that there are people out there doing whatever it takes, to just simply live. When i dont have a house to live in, food to eat, a bed to sleep in, clothes to wear, people who care about me. Then maybe i will start  to think of my life as the worst it possibly could be, and that i have nothing to live for, and that my life just could not get any worse. But until then, i will be extremely thankful  to everyone   who has ever tried to help me, who has ever took the time to talk to me, who has ever hugged me, who has ever helped me through a tough time. Because without you, i dont know where i would be, or even what i would be.  So thank you    All of you.

       OH MY EFFING JEBUS!   scariest thing  EVER  today.  i had to drop my sister off at her friends house. they live over on college ave. in the married student housings(red/blue buildings)in the universtiy.  on my way back i was walking through the university when i noticed a man(about late 30's/early 40's)behind me.  now-i get scared So easily so i just told myself "nicola,dont be stupid he's just walking"  well i got kinda lost walking around the university and i took a few turns.i looked behind me a few times along the way and the guy was STILL behind me.  now by this time i figure the guy would've known where he was going, and i was really going anywhere-just kindof walking around hopelessly looking for a way out.  so i paniced. and got very very scared.  [okay so i almost pissed myself]  i FINALLY found my way out to gordon street and crossed the road and walked along, and i looked back and the man was standing at the enterence of the university just watching me. just standing there. watching me.  i continued walking and a few minutes later looked back and he was  still  standing there,simply watching me.  so im basicully crying at this point right?  and i thought it was over right?  [wrong]  as i turned onto my street still cautious and scared...  he drives by,slowly,in a white delivery truck, staring at me .  as soon as i got home i locked all doors and just as i felt almost safe, the phone rings.[but it was just someone for my dad]  so i call josh to come over so i wouldnt be so scared.[he wassleeping but he brother woke him up,yelling in some weird accent...]  for the next half hour i basicully just sit in the living room petrified.  when th doorbell rings. josh is finally here. thank god.  so just when i finally felt pretty safe...  *phone rings* "just answer it"-josh-who also seemed a liiiiittle tiny bit scared. *phone rings* "..ok"-me *phone rings* "...hello...?"-me "...HELLO..."-man,sounded like he was on a cellphone.it was all shaky and distance. "..hello?"-me again *look of terror*-josh "..hello..helloo..HELLO"-man "..hello"-me "is this nicola im speaking to?"-man "yes..who is this!?"-me "hhahaha"-man "hello!?who is this!?"-me "i'm outside,in my truck."-man "hello who is this?!?!!!??"-me,almost crying "it's dad"-man[now known as dad] "oh my god.you scared me so much.it doesnt sound like you"-me "i told you,im in my truck in the country so the signal is bad"-me  fuck.i was so scared.  and for the rest of the afternoon josh had to keep reassuring me i was okay and i was not going to die.  and then it tell my mum,and she laughs.  i did not laugh.  this has to be my all-time most scariest event.  *sigh*  [im still scared.]  hold me until the fear goes away.

        Long time no blog.     here goes nothing.     Wednesday:     well,i dont really remember.     oh yeah.     i was home alone.     all day.     but no one could hang out.     so i sat here bored.     and lonely.     all day.          then at night.     ian told me to take 4 gravol.     so i did.     it was fun.     got verrrrrry excited.     but then.     really tied.     and it's hard to walk.     or concentrate.     or see things.     or..anything.     so josh came over for like an hour.     to basicully watch me do nothing.          then i called ian at like 1AM.     hi ian.     it was cool.     i was boring.     he was drunk.     the end.     of wednesday.      Thursday:     mhmm.     what happened thursday afternoon?     went on a walk with josh.     that's about it.          thursday night was the 'big plan'.     and it actually worked.     this is what went down, bitch.          first i told my mum staci was sleeping over.     then i went to josh's house.     well really i met him half-way     and we went to katelyns.     chilled there for a bit.     called kristy tocome.     called zach to come.     drank her dad's vodka.     smoked colts in her basement.     josh humped a whale.     the usual.          then at say,9:30     we went to go pick up staci from work.     josh pushed over a portapoty[spelling?]     we got there.     we walked to mac's.     staci,kristy et moi got a tub of ice cream.     each.     then zach went home.     and the remaining f4 went back to katelyns.          me and josh watched blind date.     staci and kristy went on msn.     then they went to tim hortons.     played air hockey with josh.     i lost.     got really tired around 3AM.     staci and kristy watched movies downstairs.     so me and josh went up to bed.     in her parenrts bed.hahaha.     ew they have most likely had sex in there.     anyways.          couldnt sleep.     so meand josh went down to scary kristy and staci.     it worked.          finally got to sleep around 7.     kristy came in to play a trick on me     it didnt work.     i just woke up.     finally got back to sleep.     josh woke me up an hour later.     so i did not get much sleep.          me and josh cleaned up the house.     then we all left.     and went out seperate ways.     and did not get caught.     yay.          Friday:     i realize some of the things from thursday     are actually friday     because they happened after midnight     but shove it.          basicully just sat around the house.     thought i was going to die.     my dad was super suspitious     but my mum talked to him     and he forgot about it.     i think.          then i went on a walk with josh.     we went to the park.     he pushed me into the sand.     got sand everywhere.     so i had to go home and shower.     then went back to his house     went to the movies     saw 'harold nad kumar go to white caslte'     funny movie.     go see it.          then we went back to his house.     looked in the penny saver     and ebay.com     for a super nintendo.     if you have one     and would like to sell it     contact josh.     i guess.          then we went to my house     watched dumb and dumber     and then i went to sleep.     the end.          well now that i've got all of those events out of my system.     my next blog will be shorter.and more boring.     yay.          from start to finish i'll run the race with you.

        howdy partner.       so yesterday i went to the beach. avec mon family. here are the basics of my trip:   -long,boring car ride.   -got shit on by a seagull   -was extremely cold on the beach.[therefore got no tan due to the fact i wore a sweater]   -had to walk 30 minutes to get to the washroom.   -got a new shirt[which i dont like all that much now]   -got a new bikini[only good thing]   -went out for dinner   -saw a certain annoying someone there.   -played mini-putt with my dad.cheated.and still lost.   -long,boring,stormy car ride home.      tada.      today was better. just hung out with josh.at katelyns. aha. yes.      and now. im getting yelled to do the dishes by my mum.   my oh-so funny mom.   who wanted to buy me a sticker yesterday that said   'dont be sexiest, chicks  hate it'.   not cool mum. not cool.     I wake up and start my everyday routine of working hard at feeling sorry for myself.And after lunch I close my eyes and wish to God that I could change but when I wake up im so very much myself.And im a long way from believing that im gonna be ok.Such a long way from believing that I'll escape this feeling that I hate.Its a miracle that we are here today with all the pain we put ourseleves through over nothing.Cause if you think hard you'll know soon it will be.And you'll be holding on to someone,holding on to someone.I wake up and start my everyday routine wondering what in the world im gonna do.Cause things are falling into place but I can not appreciate them cause if last I fell apart then this might do.Dimly lit by porch light,I can see your eyes.They are staring into my face,staring into my face.I should trust what I see in them,I know the time is right.But still I'll take the easy road and wait.I've got to stop being scared.Maybe time it isnt fair.I could die tomorrow or today.Control is resting on my side but knowing just would not be right.And thats not how I wanna live my life.And its a miracle that we are here today with all the pain we put ourselves through over nothing.Cause if you think hard you'll know soon it will be ok.And you'll be holding on to someone,holding on to someone.           as the    music stops,so do i.  NICOLA.              (song of the day=down by blink182)
