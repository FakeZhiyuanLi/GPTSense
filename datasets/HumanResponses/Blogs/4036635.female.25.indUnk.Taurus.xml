      &nbsp; Barack Obama's speech the other night really made me proud to hail from the state of Illinois, even if it has only been for the last two years.&nbsp; The whole Democratic National Convention really pumped me up...it's weird, it's like the Olympics only within our country, each state proud to represent and give up their nominations for Kerry/Edwards.&nbsp; With such enthusiasm and energy, the city of Boston was alive with "Hope (is) on the way!"&nbsp; Although, I must say, that's a bit too cheesy a tagline for my liking.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Aside from the obvious enjoyment and pride of Kerry and Obama's speeches, I also enjoyed Jennifer Granholm's presentation--she's from the OTHER state that I hail from, Michigan.&nbsp; The thing that all of these speeches had that I appreciated and was drawn to was  passion .&nbsp; For the first time in a long time, I remembered what it was like to hear a powerful presidential speech.&nbsp; We all know that Bush's address' leave a lot to be desired, and these DNC speeches really put him to shame!&nbsp; I miss those moving address'!&nbsp; You know, when 9/11 happened, I remembered walking away from Bush's address thinking "that's it? that's all you're going to say? I don't feel moved from your words, I don't feel anything."&nbsp; After watching the DNC, I realized that I wanted not just a better president, but one who could deliver a passionate, motivating speech that I couldn't see right through.&nbsp; I want Kerry, even if I don't agree with everything he does, I don't think I'll ever find a president that will meet all of my standards--he comes pretty close and ANYBODY but Bush.  &nbsp; Anyway, one of my most favorite parts was when they went through each state individually, including Guam and Smaoa (who knew? Not me!), for their delegates' nominations for the democratic presidential candidate.&nbsp; When they got to Florida, "Madam Secretary" says "Florida.&nbsp; You are given 201 votes, which we will be sure to count  each and every vote,  throughly! How do you cast your votes?"&nbsp; The rep from Florida says "Madam Secretary, in 2000 we had elected a president, and his name was Al Gore...we have been living under the labor of two Bushes for too long...you may count all 201 votes for John Kerry..."&nbsp; Oh, I laughed out loud!&nbsp; I am so glad that they made note of that...made Michael Moore proud, no doubt.&nbsp; So, to the republican parties, I say "Ha, shove it!"   &nbsp; Well, this weekend I will be back in Michigan, primarily for one of my good friend's bridal shower.&nbsp; I'm thinking it will be better than most bridal showers because a lot of good people are going to be there and it's at an upscale bar.&nbsp; We shall see...   &nbsp;Other than that, not much else going on here... you know the drill...   &nbsp;

       Okay, today was definitely filled with choices, moreso than any other day I have had since school (aka my teaching job) let out for the summer.&nbsp;    &nbsp; This morning I awoke to the sound of a very nice man offering me a chance to interview for a new position for the fall.&nbsp; I called him back once I had shed my morning voice (you always want to portray that you were up before 11am!) and scheduled an interview for 10 am tomorrow.&nbsp; The only concern was that I was already scheduled to go sit at a 2-3 day conference and get paid for it, but because it was an opportunity to find a better school, I took the interview.&nbsp; I called my mentor teacher/friend to see if she knew anything about the school, and to tell her my choice of going to the interview instead of the conference.&nbsp; Her advice was to check the school stats on the school website.&nbsp;    &nbsp; Pros: school is 5 miles closer to home.    &nbsp; Cons:&nbsp; Same type of community, same test scores/overall achievement&nbsp;(low: only 25% of students are at or above the national norms in reading or math--which leaves the inverse of 75% students who can't read anywhere close to where they should be).&nbsp; Today's conclusion: school I accepted interview with is a lateral move, a mere trade off of the school I am currently at.    &nbsp; So, I could go to the interview for&nbsp; a job that appears to be no better than the job I am already at or go sit and be numb at a conference and get paid to do so.&nbsp;    &nbsp; I just called the school and cancelled my interview.&nbsp;If you are not a teacher, you should know that there isn't a general website you can go to&nbsp;in order to post your resume and have&nbsp;people just contact you for&nbsp;a job--you have to contact the schools individually.&nbsp; It's a totally different world from the business realm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel a little guilty for passing up an opportunity like that, but I did learn something new today about my job search--I now have&nbsp;a place that I can compare my school options with,&nbsp; not just which schools have openings.&nbsp; Yea for small knowledge gains, now I will be more prepared if opportunities present themselves.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  A personal choice I had to make today was whether or not to talk to this guy I met who had responded to my Craigslist post on Saturday (that was about being bored in the city; which coincidentially led to my starting this blog; who knew posting could feel so good?)&nbsp; He seems like a really nice guy and we've been emailing for a couple of days now.&nbsp; It started just talking about the different things to do in Chicago, then it evolved into maybe we could do some of these new things together sometime.&nbsp; He sent me a picture and he seems/looks normal and nice.&nbsp; I hesitated on responding to his picture and his invite to actually take some of our brainstormed ideas and do them together, to which he noticed and apologized hoping that he hadn't freaked me out by making it more personally than the sharing of ideas.&nbsp; Eventually I thought, why the hell not?! What is holding me back all the time?&nbsp; Carpe Diem, small or large.&nbsp; So I responded to him, gave him my picture because no matter what, it's always nice to have new friends or whatever.&nbsp; Still waiting for his response, if he doesn't respond, he clearly doesn't think I am attractive via my picture.&nbsp; Cyber-vulnerability, putting yourself out there, it's the wave of the future for relationships of all kinds.&nbsp; Who am I to stop progress?&nbsp; See, taking risks, and making choices.       I had a pleasant day otherwise, the only choices I had to make are which colors of shirts I wanted to buy, and which fabrics I wanted to put on my custom purse.&nbsp; Yes, I stooped to a "sorority sister" like level...I went to the studio where you can design your own purse.&nbsp; The truth: although I typically despise the clients (aka City Trixies) who patronize said establishment, the whole process of designing my own purse was pretty cool and more girly an activity than I normally partake in.&nbsp; It was actually relaxing and fun.&nbsp; How cliche, three teachers who are off for the summer get together for lunch and shopping.&nbsp; It was a surprisingly nice change of pace, although I had no business spending $150 when rent is due on Sunday...eh, it's nice to have choices though.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;Once again, don't know if this stuff is even worth reading--if it is or if it isn't, you gotta hope that there's more to my life than this...     &nbsp;   (I can't decide if I like my tag line or not...don't comment on that, I will decide...just one of the many choices I have to make.)     &nbsp;

       &nbsp;This is my second entry, go back to the beginning to catch up...We need to note that initial blogging can be addicting, I probably should have been journaling a long time ago, it feels good to get it out there; but it's also motivating because I want to have things to write about.&nbsp; It's like those stupid army commercials they had awhile back that said something to the effect of "If your life were a book, would anybody want to read it? (insert a man making a Rarr/bark grunt and death metal music because the army is so extreme!)"&nbsp; So, yeah, I want my life or at least my thoughts to be something worth reading.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I should begin with the fact that I am an inner-city school teacher, and have been for two years now, here in Chicago.&nbsp; Although I have spent my whole life in suburban educational settings, I wanted to teach inner-city&nbsp;as sort of a let's-give-back,&nbsp; and they-need-good-teachers type of thing.&nbsp; Obviously, living in Chicago was a huge pull, but that was close behind.&nbsp; Now, I am thankful that I at least have a job! &nbsp;I recently attended a job fair downtown and there were about a thousand teachers-to-be there and approximately 15 elementary school teaching positions available.&nbsp; So, despite my looking to get hired into a new school that I feel is a better fit for me, unless something happens this month, it looks&nbsp; like I am destined to end up back at the same school that has been breaking me down for the last two years.    &nbsp; My first year of teaching there, third grade, was rather funny and novel.&nbsp; Although it drained me more than I care to admit, I decided to stay around another year because you can't judge your career based on your first year and they were going to give me second grade in the fall.&nbsp; Like I said, the first year teaching third grade was funny and novel.&nbsp; For instance, the story that always pops into mind to give people a taste of what I deal with daily is as follows:    &nbsp;   It was St. Patrick's Day 2003 and being the professional that I am (ha) I took the day off school to enjoy all that Chicago has to offer on the fun holiday.&nbsp; On the board, I left a writing prompt for the kids to respond to which basically said "tell me about a leperechaun you met, tell me what you did, where you went, etc."&nbsp; The next day I come into school and one of the kids runs up to me proudly waving his paper (his response to the aforementioned prompt)&nbsp;in front of my face. So I enthusiastically begin reading it aloud, but stopping after the first line because here's what it said, "Once upon a time there was a leprechaun named Lucky, only he wasn't so lucky because I kicked him in the mouth and told him to lick my balls bitch."&nbsp; And of course, the only things spelled correctly were "lick my balls bitch."&nbsp; I kid you not, this was a child of the tender age of 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was that age, there is no way I would have ever thought of something like that, at least not on my own--no, never.&nbsp; So I had the mother in for a conference, and she came in wearing headphones! When I motioned for her to remove them, she simply said "Oh, they're not on." Great.    &nbsp;   That is just an example of the generations of people that I am working with everyday.&nbsp; I should note that it's not a race issue, it's this particular community--they are in their own little world.&nbsp; And although it breaks my heart to see them this way, I feel like I have given more than the old college try by sticking around for two years.&nbsp; I should have ran, ran far away when the first day that I moved stuff into my classroom someone bashed in the window of my car, you know, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of "welcome to the neighborhood" gift.&nbsp; I would have perferred some brownies, but what the fuck do I know?    &nbsp;    &nbsp; The fear.&nbsp; The fears I have are that I will end up spending another year teaching in this setting only to barely survive and pay the bills or furnish the remainder of the lifestyle I live.&nbsp; Sure, I could just pack up and move back to the safety of my family back in predicatable ol' Michigan, I could even have a nice suburban teaching job with some of the connections I have there--but that's just it, I don't want to be there, I don't want predictability--not yet anyway.&nbsp; About the only "destiny/cosmic" thing I have figured out is that I am supposed to be in Chicago for at least another year.&nbsp; And that I am supposed to be teaching still.&nbsp; Love teaching, loathe the school.    &nbsp; Fear that I will never find a school that is truly a good fit. But, a month remains of summer vacation and anything could happen.&nbsp; My friend got her job at a terrific north side school the day before school started in fall '02.&nbsp; It could happen.     &nbsp;   &nbsp; One of my best friends always poses the question "what would you do if you weren't afraid?"&nbsp; I suppose right now, if I weren't afraid, I would call up some more of those schools with possible openings and fax my resumes over again.&nbsp; I would pack all my stuff up and move to London, only to be paid peanuts, but to be in another new, wonderful city (my favorite city in the world).&nbsp; I would talk to more random people more often.&nbsp; I would lose the extra weight.&nbsp; But showering and going out for dollar burgers with friends sounds like so much more fun, and I'm not afraid to do that, it's a Monday tradition after all...    &nbsp;    &nbsp; Yeah, there's gotta be more to my life than this...     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       &nbsp; WARNING: This is the first blog entry, and although I seem kind of whiney and depressed tonight, don't expect this blog to remain that way.&nbsp; I merely set the stage, and the days/weeks/months can change...can't they?!    &nbsp;    &nbsp; Sitting inside my pretty nice apartment (that I am proud of, because it's the first one that's just mine!)&nbsp; on a late summer's eve, I realize that my life is starting to feel a bit like the douche I just described.&nbsp; It's Sunday night, around 2 in the morning, my friends left a long time ago after Six Feet Under and Def Poetry.&nbsp; Amelie is on one of the Love channels, and although I own the movie, it's one of those movies that I have to watch when it is on&nbsp;(which, when I really think about it,&nbsp;I rarely end up watching any of&nbsp;the movies I own).&nbsp;    &nbsp; At 25, living in one of the best cities in the world (Chicago), I am bored out of my mind.&nbsp; I'm certain that as the summer continues, and I resume my what-should-be-the-opposite-of-depressing job in the fall, the meaning of my current life will mysteriously reveal itself.&nbsp; This online journal will capture the passing months as I venture through this&nbsp;thing that has been duped by the masses as my&nbsp;"quarter-life crisis."&nbsp; Hopefully emerging a better person on the way out...    &nbsp; Here are the things I have figured out, as of right now:    &nbsp; 1)  I am too smart to be stupid, and too stupid to be smart. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --This ties into the fact that I am too fat to be skinny and too skinny to be fat.&nbsp; The link?  Well, let's just say I eat when I am hungry and am too smart to throw it up or not eat at &nbsp; all.&nbsp; Sometimes I wish I was less informed and didn't so much mind throwing up.&nbsp;  And I need to work out more than I do... &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; I am not so fat that I cannot shop where you shop, we're not plus size...not that &nbsp; that's a bad thing.&nbsp; I'm merely trying to let you know where I am at. Besides, it's my &nbsp; blog and I can write what I want.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   2)&nbsp;I am certain that I've only begun to scratch the surface of places to go in this fair city, but I am not aware of what's left necessarily--but there's gotta be more to that as well.&nbsp; I have a month left before I trudge back to the grind.&nbsp;  I think it's weird to be bored in a city.      &nbsp;   &nbsp; 3)&nbsp; I have enough money to be able to go out whenever I want, but not enough to accomplish what I really want to be doing.&nbsp; And when I figure out exactly what that is, I'll get back to you.&nbsp;  Travel makes me happy. &nbsp; I don't do nearly enough of it, partially because my friends don't have the funds or the time off to go.&nbsp; Going to Michigan to see my parents every now and then hardly puts my urges to rest.     &nbsp;   &nbsp; 4)&nbsp; I have some great friends.&nbsp; We talk about things to death, then we go to sleep feeling as though we've accomplished something by talking about it, analyzing every aspect.&nbsp; We've spent the last two years since college talking.&nbsp;  Seems as though everyone my age group is unhappy with their lives , despite having a lot of amenities (including location, location, location).&nbsp; This whole quarter of a century mark has been harder than the rest because you really evaluate if you've done anything with your life to make a) your 30s more stable and b) yourself happy while doing (a).&nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp; 5)&nbsp; My friends and I lost one of our other friends right after graduation from college.&nbsp;  We are constantly struggling with the fact that "Life is so short, we have to do things now!" VS. "Hey, we're only 25, we have our whole lives ahead of us, let's go play!"&nbsp;  Sometimes it's motivating, but most of the time, I just don't want to do anything about anything.&nbsp; Hanging out and having a drink and a smoke or twelve, dollar burgers, sushi, beach volleyball, taking in a movie, crappy reality tv...yeah, that's living! Girls will understand that being 25 is a lot like an extended PMS trip.&nbsp; You don't want to sit, you don't want to stand, you don't want to&nbsp;stay in, you don't want to go out...just the blahs all the time.&nbsp; "How are you?" "Fine." "What's new?" "Same shit, different day."     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Which brings me to my first conclusion, there's gotta be more to my life than this...

       Hey, it's Sunday night, and I usually feel stupidly inspired after watching things like Six Feet Under, Def Poetry, and the Olympics...a killer line up, no? No, except for maybe the first two, but whatever, inspiration can come from the least likely places right. It just "puts me in the mood" to write...   Listening to the soundtrack from  Garden State  which I saw on Friday and LOVED. It was a great movie, a movie that I classify with movies like  Igby Goes Down, The Royal Tenenbaums,  and  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,  if only for the similarities in film and color. It's been awhile since I've left a movie and was like "damn, that was good, thank you." The soundtrack is excellent, I had to reconstruct though with an amalgamation of songs of Itunes as only one song is available under the soundtrack at this time. (note: Itunes is great, but lately I've found the songs I want aren't available yet. But since I only listen to classically great tunes (ha!) they should still be good no matter when they are released to the general public.) I also saw  Open Water  this weekend which was interesting and different, with a very unexpected ending. Again, not that anybody's reading this, but I won't spoil the ending for you. Found out today that the male lead, Daniel Travis, is from Clarkston, Michigan which is where a lot of my family lives. Small World.    I would now like to take a moment to complain about the rudeness of people at the 10:30pm showing at the AMC downtown! First off, let's discuss the family of ten that walked in at 10:40 and was outraged that there weren't ten seats together and proceeded to discuss it loudly with each other in Arabic during the first five minutes of the movie (granted they weren't in the water yet, so it wasn't essential to what I would loosely refer to as the plot, but still was annoying just the same!) Then when shushed by myself and several other angered patrons who just wanted to watch the unnecessary, gratuitous almost-sex scene in the beginning in peace, they swore at us and got the usher. Fortunately, the usher took our side and told them to split up into the empty seats or leave. They left. Although that was the worst of it, there was still the chick in front of us with her dopey boyfriend on his cell--she loved to comment about everything in the movie "Like, don't they know they're missing people off the boat?! That's just crazy." She was wearing an entire track suit and had a cigarette in her hand as she left the theater ready to light up upon exit. Dirty and dumb, a usual combination...      I like that I can make stupid confessions on this blog, for instance, I get teary-eyed at the Opening Ceremonies Parade of Nations at the Olympics. It's always gotten to me, especially the countries that send approximately 2 athletes and they couldn't be happier to be there. There's just so much love that night. Something about it warms my cynical little heart. Things that don't warm my heart, NBA athletes who assume that they are going to win things because they are all stars in the US. It's the entitlist attitude that gets them in trouble. It was a bittersweet loss today for Men's Basketball against Puerto Rico. I guess an upset like this hasn't happened in decades to the US. I feel that the Americans were too cocky and lost because they don't play together. They need to sit down and watch  Miracle  and learn that they don't play for themselves, but for a country--this is a high honor. Although, I'm not particularly proud of my country right now politically, I can be proud of our athletes, they didn't do anything wrong and deserve our support or whatever. And a brief political note, bought a pin this weekend at a street festival that says "Our bombs are smarter than our President." That's all on that.      God, this soundtrack is really good and I supplemented the two songs I couldn't find with a few additional tracks that fit the flow well. About the only group on there that I listen to already, and frequently, is Frou Frou. I suggest that you check the soundtrack out and explore the artists further, there's definitely some good, different sounds there.       Whoa, I just looked up at the TV which has the Olympics on mute and I thought it was swimming but all the swimmers were going out of their lanes all crazy-like, but actually, the lane lines are the ones on the tile floor of the pool and they are allowed to move anywhere they want because it's water polo. Threw me for a second...not hard to do these days...      Made a nice taco dinner for two of my best friends tonight to accompany our usual Sunday night ritual of Six Feet Under--which, I don't feel like getting into, but I will say that I can't believe there's only 3 more episodes left this season, makes me sad. Anyway, I don't cook a lot, which my mom has tried everything in her power to help me otherwise growing up, but I just don't have the finesse for it. It's not that I am bad, but I don't particularly enjoy to do it a lot. I think my mom wonders how she'll ever marry off her daughter if she can't cook for her man. You see, I come from a very large Italian family, food is very important to us. My favorite meal is my Grandma's (Nonnie's) Pasta and salad. Amazing family recipe that reminds me of home. I haven't even attempted to make the sauce, but my mom makes it and bottles it for me so I can take it back in a cooler with me to Chicago to easily reheat and enjoy. It's just not the same as the whole experience that is involved with Nonnie's pasta. I am considering taking a cooking class, if not just to get out and do something new. It's either that or a pottery class, and my mom thinks the cooking is more conducive to landing a "real" man... Now, I should note that my mom is not in my face about it, but sometimes my parents' subtlety is worse than their being forefront about their thoughts/opinions. A prime example would be that instead of "having  the  talk" or telling me that I need to start getting monograms as I get older, they would leave informational pamphlets on my side of the kitchen table (catch-all table). I should also note that both my parents are in or retired from the medical profession, so pamphlets were readily at their disposal at the hospitals. They actually met back in the late 60s on an elevator in a hospital where they were both working, but on different floors and different departments. It wasn't a love at first sight thing, but my dad hit on her or something. I should ask about the specifics next time I am home. Did my dad have more game than I do now? Huh. But yeah, I cooked tonight and it was good--we even made S'mores for dessert. I had bought this Indoor/Outdoor s'more maker (similar to the one at Cosi restaurants) for $19.99 and we intended to use it. However, I didn't realize that it came with everything except the heating element (nor did the outside of the box hint that you would need to buy something separately other than the food ingredients). So, after assembling the nifty platter complete with skewers, we had to be ghetto and toast the marshmallows on the stove top flames. You definitely need to be among close friends to throw a dinner party like this. Who knew that ghetto cooking could be so fabulous? Not me.      OK, that's all for now...

       I am having one of those days that's just kind of lame. To tell the truth, and since no one reads this blog anyway (perhaps because I haven't given anyone the address?!) I have not done much of anything lately--especially during the day. Today, I literally slept all day. I woke up at 7:37 am like usual (I don't know what happens at that time in particular, but I always wake up at that time, go to the bathroom and then back to bed) then I woke up again at 11:43am and at this point, you know you should get up and enjoy the day. Well, I went to the bathroom again, got up for about an hour, checked my email, ate some leftovers, flipped through a magazine, I stared at my enormous hampers brimming over with laundry, and went back to sleep around 1:30pm. Then I didn't get up again until 4:30pm when my phone rang and i didn't answer it. It was at this point, I decided that I had blown the entire day and that I should do something productive. So, I went to the grocery store, dropped $100 on half good things and half bad, and came home. I was supposed to have gone to dollar burgers over near Lincoln Square, but there was a CUBs game starting at 7pm, and getting out of this part of town is almost as bad as coming in. So, my lazy ass avoided telling them over the phone that I didn't feel like coming to burgers by text messaging them that I was a flake and forgot, maybe next week. I've been sitting on the couch grazing my new groceries all night.    This is going to come off as desperate and lame but those two words perfectly describe my overall day today. Do you ever get paranoid that your best friends are lying to you on occasion about stupid shit like what they've done that day or why they hadn't called like they said they would? Or in moments of desperation or loneliness you confess that you had a sad day and just don't know about your life...just to keep the conversation going? I did that today, although I was half feeling that way today so it wasn't total desperation. I have a best friend that I talk to everyday, sharing the amount of calling both ways, and typically we get along amazingly well, laughing our asses off at nothing and everything. They usually call you at certain times, like from work or whatever, and they didn't call today. It's not like you're in relationships with them where you have some sort of right to know why the routine has been disrupted, but none the less, the routine has been disrupted consecutively over the last 2 days and so you start to question shit. Stupid shit that doesn't matter, but when you don't have a significant other, you tend to feel a little paranoid about your core friends (and then stupid immediately after for feeling paranoid in the first place) that your best friends are ditching out on you, for fear of being alone. Let me clarify that I love living alone but hate feeling alone. I think I am this way because I have had too much time to think without having to work 7-8 hours a day. Too much time on my hands. And I'm not dating anybody--oh, I didn't even meet that nice guy I was talking to because I didn't feel that instant, little-to-no-effort-required click that I appreciate and find necessary these days. I don't know if it's because we're all into our careers and quality over quantity of friends right now, but I feel like I just don't want to invest time and effort into getting to know someone if it just doesn't happen naturally--either you click or you don't. That goes for plain ol friends, too. Either you get me, or you don't and we remain the most basic of acquaintances. Perhaps that is a horrible way to view things, but right now, either it falls into my lap or it doesn't, I'm not in the mood. And I am out of cigarettes and it's like 57 degrees out... I wonder if anybody else, especially those who live alone like myself, have days like this. I am unique because I have the summer off, but I still wonder. I mean, I have consciously chosen to pretty much do nothing. The job search is stagnant and over for awhile because almost all the positions have been filled and we are back into wait mode. I bet you most of the jobs will come after school starts, and don't think that I won't take them if they do. If anybody were to actually read this, they'd probably tell me to quit my bitchin and get out and do something. I know. I get it. It's not that I don't do stuff, I go out at least twice a week, and dine out about 3-5 times a week with friends, go see movies, etc. But overall, I haven't done a whole lot this summer. I should be planning for my inevitable return to my current school in 3 and a half weeks...gross...      We went to Market Days this weekend here in Boystown. It was very crowded, and not as fun as Pride weekend, at least not in my experiences. See, not even a single good story to tell you.    Hey, here's a dorky interesting thing--Dad sent me an email about how the planet Mars is closer to the Earth than it's ever been in over 5 thousand years, and won't happen for another 5thousand years. Apparently, it will be the second biggest object in the sky next to the moon. And if you have a small telescope (I'm going to try my binoculars) it should be as big as a full moon to the naked eye--supposed to be able to see the dust swirls or what have you on Mars. I am going to try to get to the planetarium sometime before the month is up, I suggest you do that too...    I have been trying to decide whether or not to join a gym. I have a problem with it because I own a treadmill, weights, etc so why would I pay to join a gym. The thing is that I rarely use them here, 5 feet away from me, so will I actually get up and go out to the gym? There's more to it than that, and I just don't feel like telling the boring details.    Anyway, that Ellen Degeneres special is on AGAIN, so I am going to watch it AGAIN, she's funny...    Bad day. My fault. Hopefully tomorrow is more interesting. And hey, this weekend is another Street Fair: Retro on Roscoe. Hold your breath...

       Just got back from the all-night Starbucks in Old Towne, met my friend up there for a cup of joe. We went there to read our books (I am currently reading David Sedaris' new book,  Dress your family in courduroy and denim , which is good so far, but doesn't hold a candle to  Me Talk Pretty One Day ) but we actually just ended up people watching and playing Mystery Science Theater with their lives. At the table next to us though was this very pretty City Trixie who was sipping her coffee and listening to her new "Vertical Horizon" cd that she just purchased at Borders. As she was sitting there minding her own business and bad music, a short, muscular, dorky guy walked up and asked if it was ok to sit at her table. Apparently he had spoken to her before because he asked her if she remembered him, it had been awhile. She politely removed her headphones and they chatted awkwardly for a little bit. I stopped paying attention to them but noticed that he was now listening to her music and she was talking very hush-hush on her telephone (to the point where she was covering up the receiver--which we imagined she was desperately asking this person to stay on the phone with her until this poor guy left her table!) It was getting sad for our stocky little friend, that girl stayed on her phone for about 20 minutes before the guy got up to leave--he says to her (mind you, she's still on her phone) "Well, I will look forward to seeing you next time, and I will make you a cd of some really good shit..." She nodded and proceeded to talk on her phone. As soon as the guy left and drove away, she hung up her phone and returned to her bad music. It was embarrassing to even watch, we felt bad for the guy but he didn't seem put off by her complete rudeness to him (but was obvious to anyone else that she was completely trying to ward off his attempts to chat her up). Although we applaud him for trying, everybody needs to realize when they've stayed at the party a little too long! We never did get around to reading our books, that whole scene just put us into a more silly mood...      I forgot to add that on the plane ride the other day it was similar to being in a movie for just a second because someone actually uttered the phrase "Is there a doctor on the plane?!" As we were taxing toward the runway, a man a few rows up began convulsing in a seizure and blacked-out! Moments later, he said he was fine and that he needed to go on the short flight to Detroit. The stewardess was just short of saying something like "Sir, it's against FAA regulations..." but she didn't, so I was slightly bummed. There was a fire truck, police SUV, and an ambulance there and they escorted the very pale man off the plane. I hope he's ok though, he seemed to think he was and that seeing the doctor was just a formality...it was kind of scary and exciting all at once, but was over in approximately 15 minutes and our flight was still on time. Thank you Northwest.   Big street festival this weekend here on the Northside of Chicago called Market Days. It's supposedly bigger than Pride weekend, but that remains to be seen. And although I am not gay, nobody throws a better party...I just hope we have a good time either way. We shall see.   Job search still continues, hopefully something will pick up next week...and as my Brit Lit teacher said when we studied in London of 2000, "More anon."

        Six Feet Under tonight was interesting. At first I thought it was going to be a lame episode soley based upon the two main hallucinations/dreams (the mother seeing all of George's past wives' heads mocking her life from specimen canisters, Lilly Taylor as a petunia in an onion patch) but it turned out to be one that really, er, I apologize if I sound like Claire here, spoke to me or meant something.            The opening sequence of the "tumor lady" was really scary and truthful because I have been feeling like a bit of a hypochondriac lately (but not telling anybody about it, because I'm only 25 and I'm just exaggerating these minor ailments in my mind). For example, a sharp pain in my foot, or a new mole in an unlikely place, etc. I will spare you the details, but sometimes there are certain things that my body does/has that cause me to panic. I wish it had some logical bearing like "well, I lost my friend unexpectedly 2 years ago, I'm just over sensitive when anything is out of whack." But, I don't think that's entirely the reason, I have a tendency to worry that these things I keep noticing are all omens/signs of some impending fate. I look for signs in all other aspects of my life, what if my body is trying to tell me something about my health, and I just keep putting it off? I get all my regular yearly visits, and everything appears normal. But what if I am going to the wrong doctor...then I push it out of my mind and forget about it until I have indigestion or a bad charlie horse in my calve(s). Anyway, the opening sequence of the woman with the tumors tonight, kind of set my mind reeling...            Also, the realization for Nate and Brenda (the initial idea, not the cliff hanger for next week's episode) that they never really give themselves a chance for a normal, happy relationship. Sometimes I feel like I get to invested in relationships, either with friends or family, that may keep me from having a regular relationship. How being scared of intimacy can actually push you into even more unstable circumstances, which feel safe because they're old hat, but they're not really. I don't think I want Nate and Brenda to be together, although you know that when Brenda does get pregnant there's going to be that huge drama of who's kid is it? Nate or Joe? They have been foreshadowing that shit for weeks, we get it. I love Rachel Griffiths but I thought she was already pregnant because of some of the outfits they had her in, her boobs looked bigger as well. I thought it was a whole nod to Will and Grace for Debra Messing's strategic placement of pillows and bags, and her endless supply of horrible mumus (moo-moos). But according to this week, she's not pregnant...it's only a matter of time...        I don't care about Ricco's problems.           Claire and Mena Suvari's character, finally already. Ever since the first episode where they introduced Mena (Eddy?) you knew that Claire could not get enough of her electric personality. But, I have no bets on what will happen...although, being gay tends to run in families. I know of at least three families, personally, that have at least two children who ended up being gay. Then again, this is a TV show. I just like the whole struggle Claire goes through which she says something to the effect of "half of me wants this but the other half doesn't...but what if that other half doesn't want this because it's just scared." I dismiss ideas sometimes on the same premise, and then I rethink it because what if the other half is just scared.           They teased us last week with the rebirth of the David/Nate dynamic, which I have always enjoyed. And although there was less this week, I appreciate the nod to Nate's support of David's behaviors as a result of the random trauma from two episodes ago. But, I would like to see more, and it appears we just may as David continues on his downward spiral.     And props go out to Kathy Bates and Patricia Clarkson, whom I always enjoy. James Cromwell's character, love to hate him, creepy man--"that'll do pig."--Babe But let's wrap that up, shall we...      Hold up, Tracey Morgan is on Def Poetry.      OK, nothing really that impressive from Tracey there.         Anyway, I had a good weekend here in Michigan visiting friends and family, primarily in town for a bridal shower that was today's all-day extravaganza. Went to bed at 4:30am, got up at 9:15am to go set up for a bridal shower at 5pm. The event planners did a fantastic job, and I was pleased to be able to help out. Except for the loading and unloading of folding chairs and tables, taking them up and down two flights of stairs. We had help, but it was hot as hell out today, too. Anyway, the couple was happy and the party went well. Yea.       I've been able to spend some time with my most beautiful niece, who will be two in November. Sometimes I think I have never seen a more beautiful child. Makes me think maybe I will actually want one of my own someday, but then again there's no guarantee I will ever have such a cute, smart kid. The family says that they can't get over how much she looks and acts like me, especially comparing at that age, I'm flattered, but god help her at the same time!! She's fantastic though, and it makes my heart hurt to leave her and go back to Chicago. Love her.      I have been so inspired to write this weekend, but now that I am here, I guess I don't have that much poetic flow to share. Wow, KRS-ONE and Doug e Fresh have something to say...      Onward...
