      I just got hold of some webspace and i am going to be putting up some stuff like downloads and pictures and what not. Stupid shit really. but good stupid shit. I put a link up on the left for the BOW website. It isnt up yet but i thought i should go ahead and put it there before i forgot. If you read this and are seeing nothing but question marks when it comes to BOW then the site will explain soon enough. The sooner Jack brings me some stuff or gives me some more ideas the sooner the site will be up.

      I just saw the LOTR MOVIE!! 3 Hours of bliss. i got a sore ass from sitting and these women in front of me kept clapping every 2 or 3 minutes. but that didn't stop it from being wonderful. I couldn't take my eyes off of the movie. It was the greatest sequel of all time. Not like scream  (I haven't seen Matrix Revolutions, but i am told it doesn't stand up to Reloaded. Sad) or any other crappy sequels that just get worse towards the end. However, i thought scream 3 was funny. I found myself being one of  the only people in the theater to laugh. especially when the knife smacks him in the forehead. But back to LOTR. 
   -I would hate to tell anything about the movie in depth because if the 3 people that see this post haven't seen the movie yet it may ruin parts for them. Although nothing could ruin this movie. 

    -On the note about sequels, I really can't wait for the third Star Wars movie in 05. It better knock my socks off or i'm gonna personnaly find Gearge Lucas and.....Well, probably get arrested as a stalker. But the guys in my cell are going to hear about how he wronged me and my fellow movie goers. -- urlLink CollegeHumor -- urlLink Chokey Chicken -- urlLink smit happens -->If i left any out then............

*I also went to HaloScan to get a comments thing for my posts. If i did it wrong then i guess i'll just let it be wrong. But thanks to those guys for it. There should also be a link button somewhere on the page.  ?

      As we celebrate the year of the monkey we also have to give it up to my man Jesus. tupac if you're listening, over there in the carribean with jimi hendrix, this years for you guys. 
*also i took some pictures of some wounds from where Jack shot me with an airsoft pistol. I know they're scary to look at but here.  urlLink airsoft 1  -  urlLink airsoft 2 
As youo can see by those we had fun. Jack was gone when i decided to take the pics, but i got him a bunch. Plus i shot  him in the ass with the airsoft pistol when he bent over to pick up a bb. he was feelin that one. muhuhahaha
*plus i made a copy(shhh) of that tatu cd that guffey had. And i never knew it but those chicks are bad ass. that and the audioslave cd i copied. i can listen to the whole thing the entire way through and not have to skip. thats how great it is.

Just talkin 'bout Meacham" Jennifer' we'll always have the bathroom, Guffey, damn i love potatoes

      I've missed the first day back to school as with just about every previous year. But i guess they won't  start recording my absences till i actually go a first day. I tried posting a link to show when i am on aim or not. if it works then thats good, i'll need to figure out how to put up my yahoo status. but if it doesn't work...well i have another 3 or 4 hours till i need to get ready for school. maybe i can get all the little things sorted out sometime. What with being single once again, and having all this free time on my hands i still manage to do......nothing. Some people have resorted to calling me a bum. I am not going to argue this as I am a great bum, and i love what i do. Which is nothing, and.....hitting on random girls......and..........sleeping.....and thats about it. I also hit on girls i know, but being as i am a guy thats expected. I guess i'll end this with a shout out to all my peoples...or just a few.....Jack, my brotha-Jennifer, don't ask, don't tell-Guff, my other brotha (gobbledygook)- and last but not least, all the bitches and da hoes.
Oh plus i thought I should put a button up for  urlLink Visual paradox . A great place to get fantastic wallpaper.

      On this day in the year of the monkey, We will introduce you into a revolutionary calendarial breakthrough amongst mankind, It is known as "the Year of the Boob" dont be mistaken this concept does not over ride the year of the monkey but actually coincides with it, except in lower Kentucky and the South Eastern Swahili region of North Africa, there it's just no year at all since the Great squirel fire, now they just in-breed. But anyways, the concept is to see as many Boobs throughout the year and keeping track. then at the end of the year You have the satisfaction of knowing you saw hundreds of boobs (potentially). Then when its all over, just start again and look for more boobs, they must be voluntarily shown no force allowed. So from here forth every year from now till the end of time will be "the year of the Boob" except 3145 which is reserved for the jews.

      Just got back from National Guard duty, we hosted the operation Mad Dragon for the JROTC's Gobbledygook, the british bastard, broken hip, mini reese and big head all got lit up from my OP 4 squad on the down pilot orienteering lane.  It was great except a snake almost bit my wang and i think i have poison ivy.  All in All it was a great weekend except I haven't talked to my friend S and I think she's still pissed at me and that blows ass. 
                                                                                  ~Godfather~

      Don't know what happened to the godfather this weekend at Gobbledygook's but he missed a hell of a show. Yes thats right, Guff was electrocuted. By a lamp. We had all been playing the Xbox for hours and i had just about finished off a box of girl scout cookies when we all decided it was time to turn in. Guff went to the lamp and turned the knob only to set it off. A loud buzz followed by sparks and flames coming out the top then the sides. If only we had a picture. Guff let go of the lamp only after the flames spouted and then started holding his heart. Of course it scared the hell out of all of us, but i'm sure guff almost pissed himself. We were rolling before it was even over. I know we're sick. But we made sure he wasn't gonna die and i grabbed the cord and unplugged the lamp and then we laughed some more. We didn't go to sleep for another few hours. And Guff finally got the feeling back in his arm.

*Secondly- I played pool against James last night. My first game of billiards against a blind guy. I also  learned those round things in Guff's gumball machine aren't marbles and you could eat them.

*ZZtop rocks. 'I'm just lookin for some tush'
* urlLink Transformers  also rock. If anyone sees this and has the movie, i wanna borrow it.

Anywho, the play thing chris mentioned me going to that was a totally manly play. I mean a guy got hit with a rifle. sure it was a musical but there were alot of women wearing lowcut dresses so there were lots of boobs.  Plus i got to spend time with S I kinda felt awkward at firstbecause i was wearing jeans combat boots and a Gary Coleman Bling Bling shirt while everyone was wearing coats and ties. I'm outta here ill try topost again before i leave for basic  PEACE

      Got bored with the old look so i changed it. A lot has happened since my last post. Jeska was beautiful at prom. All went well until afterwards, but shit happens. And
Once I get this picture scanned the Godfather's polital career is shot. I had an incident with a coupla cubes of ice, Jeska was there. Great fun, nuff said. I spent Saturday with Gobbledygook and the godfather. We weren't doing well at keeping score, but we probably got our asses kicked at baseball by those kids. And then the green shirt man showed up and it all went to hell. Had he have touched that popcorn though.......
* Got invited to be a king of waffle house, but turned it down. So did the other 5 guys. Us idiots! We coulda lived like kings! Of WAFFLE HOUSE!!
* The Godfather went and saw a woman play [Les miserables.(Shudder)]with Sarah. Poor bastard. But it was with good intentions. I would have done the same in that situation. But still...(shudder)

*  BRAK IS COMIN BACK!!!!!! Sundays at 12:15!!!! 

Holy hell it's early. I gotta get up soon.

What the hell is with that intro guy on MTV? I bet he gets paid out the ass for that. I don't know if they know this at MTV, but there are people in the world like us that would hop around like idiots on tv for next to nothing. Or hell probably free. (just as long as i got to show my ass once or twice)

You're the color blue. You have the three c's in life--you're cool, caring and confident. Trustworthy and honest, people are naturally attracted to you. You're unusually optimistic, but that makes life all the better. You're an imaginative person who loves sleeping and dreaming. Hard-working and determined, you excell in school. You're everybody's favorite, and this is because you have this undefined richness in your personality and attitude. Mild-tempered and stable. Not to mention very intelligent. Along with the fact that you're conservative, you're worried about the environment. So basically, you're a generous, dependable and devoted--just the kind of person everybody needs. Wouldn't it be great if everybody in the world were like you?

  You're orange.  You're strong and have the reflexes of a tiger.  You're overly protective, and those skills come in handy...  You're a natural person, with a taste for natural foods (I mean organic, here.).  Well, that's not true. ...Just food in general!  You're as quick-witted as your reflexes, and sometimes painfully logical.  You love wild animals and pets.  (Preferably wild animals!)  You're a natural person, and a true child of Gaia. You're a stimulating, and outgoing person.  You enjoy making people think, especially with your infectiously spontaneous attitude.  You're a generally optomistic person, with a love for showing off all of your good traits.  Although many people may see you as strung-out, or just plain weird, you're very down-to-earth and humble.  You're incredibly sweet (as this color's other name!), and you care about people in general.  As this color would describe, you're energetic beyond all human comprehension.  You've got a nack for drawing, and you enjoy it, too.  When it comes to school, you're a good listener with an even better memory.  You're studious...  At least when you need to be!

*Yea I was sposed to go and help mow. Got a lecture for askin though cause I don’t even mow my grass. But thank Tupac cause it sounds like the Hornets were fun. 

* “i miss chris SOOOOOO much, to tha point where i'd fuck him in public.” Well baby, it seems that import’s alarm ruined it all. I hate those little rice burnin fuckers! :D I broke 100 bowling that night. But I’m 0 and 1 for sex on the hood of a honda(? I think it was) :p

*As for rafting, Me and Jack went a coupla years in the rotsee. I’m sure he, or better yet, his face, remembers the grueling tetherball competition. It was fierce. And most of the time it was dark. Great sport. This is the place aspirations of tetherball in the olympics arose.

*Our Production of Primitive Meacham is as triumphant as it is scary. Having seen and partially made this abomination (as in we are going to hell for it) of a short film, I can say we have many problems. But Hell I was rollin the entire time, and not just cause Jack hit me in the hip with the butt of a rifle. [You were laughin asshole!] But be prepared as with shock the world with the proof of the existence of the Primitive Meacham (Meachimus stupidus).

*I am wonderin how it tallies profile views exactly cause now I am at 52 and Jeska is at 52 and Jack is at..4? Weird

*Brak is wonderful as always

*Jeska got her Belly Button pierced. I have yet to see it, but it’s Jeska so it’s bound to be great no matter. (Cute belly…) I said cute ah! 2wice now! I need a big piece a beef. And uh (cough)some uh man stuff. Damnit. :) Love you baby

*It’s early-I need Sleep. I’m out
