      If you have the game Half-Life for the pc here is a great MOD. This mod is called Natural Selection, it was developed by Unknown Worlds Entertaiment. In my opinion this is one of the bests mods ever. You can play as an alien or a marine. If you are the marine you have to defend your base, and if you are an alien you have to defend the alien mother,or whatever it's called. And it's free, all you need is the program steam, www.steampowered.com, and the game half-life. It's great check it out.  urlLink

      Tired of hitting by accident the windows key while playing First Person Shooters or other games. Then use this program called "I Hate This Key", it will disable the windows key, so you don't have to worry about your computer crashing when you press the key. And did I mention there is a free version of this program. (free version shown in picture, some features are disabled.)  urlLink

      Menuet OS is an operating system that fits in a single floppy disk. It runs directly off of it, so you don't to install anything on your hard drive. It will run on almost any system, even old systems. It only requires a little amount of ram, like 8 megs or so, and it's very cool. It includes games, word editors and it's able to connect to the internet. It only contains games like tetris, chess,etc. But check it out. The website is  urlLink www.menuetos.org  .  urlLink

      I was looking for a live Linux CD, and I found Morphix. It's based on knoppix, but slightly modified. There are 3 versions, the first one is Morphix lite, it's only 200 megabytes and it has included a word editor, a web browser, and all the basic stuff. I haven't checked the GNOME version, but give it a try. And the last one is called Morphix Gamer, it has more apps, especially games, like the original doom, a demo of ut2003, and many more games like solitary, etc. And this OS is 700 megabytes. Check them out and tell me what you think.  Later  :-)

      So I was trying to log on into the blogger website with Internet Explorer and Mozilla and I kept getting an error in both browsers. I dont know if it was only my pc or the Blogger servers had problems. I f you know please let me know. This happened to me around 5:30 or 5:40. And also I've been trying access tag-board.com and i keep getting the same error. Is there anything wrong with the internet or is it just me.  later :-P

      So a while ago I heard about this program in my favorite tv show, The Screen Savers, so I downloaded it. I hadn't used it much, but now that I've spent a little more time messing with it, I love it. With this program you can create and broadcast your playlists over the internet. Also you can listen to other people's playlists, chat with them, and even make picture albums so other people can see them. Oh, and also you can make blogs and publish them so other mercora users can see them, and publish their commnets.  Peace :-)

      If you tired of annoying pop-ups give this program a try. It's called STOPzilla, this pop-up blocker really works. It's not free, i think it costs $19.95, but there is a 30 day trial i think. I bought and I've using it for about 1 year and i haven't had any pop-ups. It also stops spyware and other programs like that. So check it out. You can find more information at www.stopzilla.com. Or if you want a great browser that has a built-in pop-up blocker and without the flaws of IE check out Mozilla Firefox at www.mozilla.org and it's open source so it's free.  urlLink
