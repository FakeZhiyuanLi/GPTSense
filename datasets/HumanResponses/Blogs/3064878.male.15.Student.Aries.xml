       I'm going to try to get a few more people involved in this, if possible.  I'm also gonna try to get the people who are involved to post more.  My other ther goal for this site is to get a template more befitting this blog's name.  Yesh.  Yesh indeed.

       Okay intro of myself...basically, I'm a 14-year old guy who is trying real hard to get his webcomic noticed.  That can be seen  urlLink here .  But anyway, I like to read various webcomics like the 10K Commotion, Eidiolic Fringe, Penny Arcade, Bob and George, etc.  My friend John got me to do this blog with him...so..guess we'll see what happens!

       Nick here... sorry I haven't been on in a while... Anyway... I'm moving... *sniffle* Just when I found true love!  My brother and my dad were being real assholes today... I was showing them and my mom how to play a game... and my brother was cracking jokes every ten seconds... Me: That is called a sandwhich... Him: Rye or wheat bread with ham!  Me: Fuck You Branden!  Dad: WTF did you just say!  Me: BLAH BLAH BLAH Then I came to the computer... only to find out that I need a new graphics card and that my cd drive doesn't work anymore...
