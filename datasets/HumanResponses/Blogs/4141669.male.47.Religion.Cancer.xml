						     Are You Called to Short-term Missions?         My name is Bobby. Welcome to my small piece of cyberspace. I work for a church in a north Dallas (TX) suburb and help facilitate trips to fascinating places all over the world. This is a recent change of assignment for me as my work for some time has been in the arena of local outreach and evangelism - working with the homeless, the incarcerated and people in very needful situations. I have, however, always had a passion for people in other countries and longed to travel to bring the Word of God to them.    Last year I had the privilege to speak on the streets of Diriamba, Nicaragua and to a men's prayer gathering in Puerto Vallerta, Mexico. The desire I held in my heart was brought to fulfillment a couple of months ago when I was transferred to our Short-term Missions Department. I am preparing for a trip later this month - again to Nicaragua, but this time we will also spend a few days in beautiful Costa Rica. In November I will be going to the Cairo, Egypt and then to Mexico City in December.  My prayer in keeping this blogspot is to be a source of encouragement, empowerment and blessing to others who may feel the desire of the heart to venture out into the rest of the world. God places in each one of us gifts and abilities. And for many of us, He also grants a special desire and willingness to use those gifts and abilities in a foreign country.  If you find yourself drawn to another land - perhaps you just keep thinking of another country, perhaps your ears perk up when you hear it mentioned on the news, or your heart breaks when you hear about oppression, flooding, violence or starvation there - then seek the Lord in prayer to determine if He is drawing indeed drawing you somewhere, out there. If so, pray for an open door to explore the wonder of His will there.  It is amazing and He is due so much praise for it, as He will provide a way to get you there, if you will open up to His will.  Short-term missions are a way to test the waters.  Are you called to be a missionary somewhere?  Or, to use your gifts and abilities on a short-term assignment.  You also will test your own limits. Can you do without the creature comforts of home? Can you adjust? Do you hold up well in an environment of change?  Can you pack light?  Can you eat THAT?  The second amazing thing is that He is, indeed, already there. This is evidenced in the help you will find along the way, the people He will put in your path, and the favor you will be shown as you travel.  The third amazing thing is that language is not that big of an obstacle when you are on a well-planned short-term mission trip.  Yes, you will not be able to carry on a conversation like you might like but that is actually a good thing.   For example, on my most recent trip to Nicaragua we were helping a local church put on Vacation Bible School for a couple hundred youngsters and then helped repaint a local Christian school.  With language out of the way, the only thing you can communicate is the love of Christ.  It shows in your smile, in your work, in the way you carry yourself.  It speaks louder than words.  The first day we were painting it was our team and a couple of teachers from the school.  By the end of the evening some other parents had joined in.  By the middle of the next day an entire army of parents, students and neighbors had joined us, many of them bringing their own tattered paint brushes from home.  We had started the job.  We had purchased the paint and supplies.  We were the catalyst that ignited a team effort to complete a very large task.  At the end of the second day, the work was completed and all of us, young and old, American and Nicaraguan, English-speaking and Spanish-speaking, toured through the building and celebrated as the school name was reapplied, carefully lettered by a local artisan.  Even if you only go once on such a trip I encourage you to go.
