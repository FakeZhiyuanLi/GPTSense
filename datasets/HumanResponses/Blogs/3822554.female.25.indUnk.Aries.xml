      I was in a mood when I got home from “work” yesterday. The day felt like a waste, filled with dull meetings and too many breaks. The night was rescued by dinner with Purba and Célia but my bad mood was there again when I woke up this morning.  It was one of those days where I didn’t particularly feel like leaving the house, but the prospect of staying home felt equally depressing. A no-win situation. I hunkered down to read  1984  for an hour in bed before facing the world.  Half an hour later, the world came to me. I was still in my pjs when I got a phone call from the post office making sure I was home to receive a package. I ripped off my cloud-covered flannels and threw on jeans and a tank top. I had been awaiting a birthday package from Aya for some time but had recently been told that it was sitting by her desk accumulating things. Only yesterday she wrote to say she had shipped it. Knowing how slow the mail is here, I was sure the package I was about to receive was something else—maybe some boring computer things for Erik.  Wrong! It was my birthday package in all its glory. Aya, with her gifts from the Teen Vogue closet, kept me from looking shabby all last year. Sometimes when I saw her, it felt like walking into an H&M with an all-H&amp;M outfit on. To explain her generosity, she would often say that I fit the Teen Vogue style perfectly. I could never quite decide if this was insulting. Am I still languishing in teen fashion while the rest of our friends have moved on? But who has time to dwell on such questions when there’s a Vivianne Westwood bag waiting on your bed?  Of course it's not just my wardrobe that misses Aya. Without her there is no one to aimlessly wander the streets with on a Sunday afternoon. But that kind of thing only affects me. Lots of other people have to share the misery of my boring clothes. This package might provide some relief. It contained: 6 boxes of Annie’s Mac and Cheese in 3 different flavors (okay, not fashion-related but almost as important), 1 pink stripey headband, 1 spring scarf, 1 compact mirror; 2 polka dotted sneakers (1 pair), and 1 strappy green watch. I’ve never really worn a watch but have wanted to start. The gift was timed perfectly (no pun intended). It took me a solid 20 minutes to figure out the clasp and now I never want to take it off (both because I love it and because I think I might not be able to maneuver the clasp again). I’m such a watch novice that I’m actually unsure of the procedures: does one sleep with a watch on? Shower with it?  Hopefully some of my new items might bring me luck during tomorrow’s oral exam. Maybe if I wear everything at once: scarf, headband, shoes, and watch, the examiners will be so taken aback by my “bling” that they won’t notice the mistakes I’m making.  Wallpaper:   Emil och Griseknoen , the movie. About a mischievous farm-boy who trains a pet pig and then mistakenly gets drunk off of homemade cherry wine.

      I came in to work this morning with the sole task of grading an essay in front of me. When I arrived, I saw that my fellow teacher and grading partner had neglected to leave the essay in my mailbox. I couldn't go home because I'm meeting Celia here for lunch. Instead, I decided to go through my yahoo! inbox and tend to long neglected business.  I've been keeping a couple of emails from Teddy in my inbox, waiting for a chance to give them the attention they deserve. These weren't personal mails but things like forwarded articles and web addresses. After registering myself for an oline word-game and playing that for half an hour, I moved on to my second saved email: an article I had been meaning to read. It detailed the writer's quest to track down the origin of the term "Jersey Girl" and what it means today.   Being a proud Jersey Girl, and knowing that I have at least a few tried and true Jersey readers, I thought I'd pass the piece on. I would just post the link but the article is archived now, which means you have to buy it. To avoid any weird sort of copywrite infringement, I'll just post an excerpt that gets to the "heart" of it all.   Excerpt from "Proudly Answering to 'Jersey Girl'" By Helene Stapinski  Published: April 4, 2004 in The New York  Times    That night, I got back into my car and headed to Asbury Park. To the Stone Pony, the club Bruce Springsteen made famous. It was Ladies' Night at the Pony, so I was bound to run into a few true-blue Jersey girls, all bright and beautiful, with ruby lips and teeth of pearl.I had barely gotten the question past my own ruby lips - what is a Jersey girl? - when Elsa Wyers explained, point by point, what I should be looking for.  "No. 1," she said, "she has to love Bruce Springsteen. She has to own every Bruce Springsteen record ever made. No. 2, loves the beach. No. 3, party girl. She throws the biggest parties on the Jersey Shore in the summer."  ...Her best friend, Nicole McKenna, said the true litmus test for a Jersey girl was this: "You always say you can't wait to get the hell out of this place. But you A) never leave, or B) leave and then want to come back."  ...Most important, Elsa said, Jersey girls have their very own sense of style. And it does not necessarily include hoop earrings and big hair. According to Elsa's outfit, this sense of style would include a cut-off pleated denim miniskirt; a tight black shirt; a Prada bag ("not a knockoff," she said); blue eyeshadow; a toe ring; blond hair tied in two knots on top of her head; chunky-heeled black Steve Maddens; a Marlboro Light between her fingers; and a silver Tiffany-style choker with a heart dangling from it.  Which brings us to the main requirement for every Jersey girl.  Heart.  ...Living in Jersey was not even a requirement, I thought. Sure, you had to have lived in Jersey for some extended period. It helped to have been born and raised. But you could have gone off and conquered the world. Once a Jersey girl, I thought, always a Jersey girl. Feisty, fast and full of attitude.  These girls were all around us, changing the world we lived in. The first girl ever to play Little League in America was a little Jersey girl from Hoboken, Maria Pepe. The punk pioneers Debbie Harry and Patti Smith were both from the Jersey suburbs. Martha Stewart, domestic goddess/convicted felon, was from Nutley. In fact, you couldn't swing your Prada bag without hitting a Jersey girl.  The test - the true test - wasn't whether she lived here anymore, or whether she had made it big or small, or even whether she was headed to prison. It was whether, in secret, she really preferred Callahan's to caviar; would rather have a Kohr Brothers cone than a crème brûlée.  A Jersey girl had a job and was smart, but also knew how to cook. "You know how to make the sauce," said my husband. "It's one of the reasons I married you."  A Jersey girl had E-ZPass, but also remembered how to hurl her change into the Parkway basket over the hood of the car from the passenger seat. A hook shot. Two points.A Jersey girl knew the streets of "the City," but also knew the secret entrance to the Holland Tunnel (behind the Newport Mall, of course).   Okay, I confess, I didn't know about that secret entrance by the Newport Mall. (In fact, where the hell is the Newport Mall?) I'm going to assume that it is only useful when approaching the tunnel from another direction, like the Turnpike South. What I do know about is the smooth taste of Kohrs' custard and how to make a mean hook shot without even slowing the car.

      It’s taken me until today to fully get over Sunday night.   Up until then, my weekend was low-key. Erik and I saw  Troy  on Friday night. We hadn’t been to the movies in a long time and we were excited for the 2 1/2 hours of Hollywood fluff. I mostly enjoyed  Troy , except for a very boring romance between Paris and Helen (Orlando Bloom and a blah-faced beauty), some weird anachronisms in the dialogue, a loudly commenting man next to me who promptly took over the arm rest and sent me cowering into Erik on my right, and the wailing women soundtrack. These wailers were the first thing Erik and I discussed as the credits rolled. I was satisfied to see the very thing discussed this week in Salon. Check out the article at:   http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2004/05/25/wails/index.html   We spent Saturday reading and then had another quiet night to ourselves. We made some “gourmet” pizza with fresh mozz and grilled eggplant and ate it while watching  Apocalypse Now: Redux .  And then there was Sunday. I met Celia for coffee in the afternoon and then came home for what promised to be a third quiet night. I still had two YA novels to read, so after dinner I took a nice long bath and emerged feeling relaxed and refreshed. When I checked my email, I had a message from one of my students. It said something along the lines of: “Hi Amy. I think I may have received an email meant for someone else.” That was the end of my cozy weekend.  A few hours earlier I had sent an email to a teacher that I work with. In it I sent out my grades from the students’ final presentations. The grades ranged from A-F but the scale is different than the American one. "A" is fabulous. "C" isn’t bad. There is an "E". And only "F" is failing. Here is a copy of the email (the names have been changed):  "Here is the run-down of my grades from Wednesday. As for June 1st, I'm going to need to go over what is required a bit more. Will you be around tomorrow or Tuesday to have a chat?   -Amy   THE BLUEST EYE #1  --Good handle of the novel but no clear thesis until very end. Not a very strong one then, either.  Jenny: B, B, C  Jan: B, B, C   THE COLOR PURPLE  --Dull and unoriginal thesis but solid presentation  Elsie: B, D, B  Astrid: C, B, B   TYPICAL AMERICAN  --Very solid. Handled Questions well.  Jack: E/F, D, B  Lena: C, B/C, B   THE BLUEST EYE  --Very weak thesis. Don't seem to have a grasp of the book.  Ida: C, C, D  Anna: C, B/C, D”  Funny thing is, instead of going out to the other teacher, the email was sent to every student in the class. Way to ruin a night. When I received the email from “Lena,” I basically had a meltdown. I paced as best as I could in my small apartment and said Oh My God about a thousand times, while Erik tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the email, I cried and called my mom. Then I called my mentor to ask for advice and comfort but he didn’t answer. At the end of my rope, I looked up the home number for teacher who was meant to receive the email  and called him—crying, at 9:30pm on a Sunday night. How professional.  He lived up to his Californian persona perfectly and only laughed when I told him what happened. I felt better when I got off the phone with him, knowing that even if the students would hate me, the teachers probably wouldn't. I wrote an apology to the students and then went out with Erik to the only store still open (it was now 11pm) and bought chamomile tea.  I didn’t think I’d be able to fall asleep but my crying exhausted me just enough for the tea to actually soothe me. I slept through the night and woke up dreading my day.  Monday was spent taking back staircases and keeping a low profile. Before I busted home at lunchtime, I checked in with the other teachers. The resident dry Englishman asked me if I had received any death threats yet. His comment was exactly what I needed to really start getting passed the embarrassment. No one really cared; everyone thought it was rough, but funny. One was even impressed that I wasn’t more subjective in my analysis (the presentation stunk but he smelled even worse!).  I was still on edge yesterday and jumped at the chance to leave school early to attend a play that someone I work with had produced. So Erik and I were two of ten audience members at an afternoon showing of Edward Albee’s Zoo Story at Malmö Högskola. It was surprisingly good (though the actors had quite thick accents and pronounced bewilder like a command to be crazier--"be wilder.") I went directly from the play to yoga and from yoga to home.   Today I had a stressful day organizing another round of student presentations. I’ll be there tomorrow to listen to these sophomore final projects and give my grades. Luckily this class knows nothing about my gaffe with their freshman colleagues.  And up till now, I've received no angry emails from the students I embarrassed.   It’s been a tiring week and it’s only half over. Erik is popping some popcorn and we’re going to watch a movie version of  Bröderna Lejonhjärta --my new favorite children’s book.

      So I sleep like hell on Saturday night and wake up covered, absolutely  covered  in sweat. Still, I'm optimistic. I get up, shower, put on jeans and a sweater, eat a late breakfast, and call Purba, since we have tentative plans to meet for coffee in the afternoon. Luckily we decide to skip it in favor of meeting up before going to a bar with our class the next day. Within an hour of waking up I'm back in bed with a fever.   The day's a bust but at least the TV line-up is good: Felicity, Dawson's Creek, and Everwood. During an hour-long, ibuprofen-induced bout-of-health I manage to bake a loaf of banana bread to take with me for snacks in the week and run to the grocery store to buy elbow macaroni. The only food that sounded good to me was elbows&nbsp; with butter and salt.   My Main concern on Sunday was not being sick for Monday. (Apologies for the sudden tense-shift. I got tired of present.) I had a tiring and important day planned with an interview in the morning and student presentations all afternoon. A second sweaty night later and it was Monday morning. For possibly the first time ever, Erik actually had en easier time getting out of bed than I did. Before I could budge, I needed brought to me: a glass of juice, two ibuprofen tablets, a glass of water, a hot-water bottle, and a bottle of water (that last one was a misunderstanding).   Considering the rough start, I actually began to feel functional within an hour and left the house. I had been too sick the day before to walk to the train station and retrieve my bike, left there on Friday afternoon, and planned to take the bus.&nbsp; My slightly slowed, achy-legged walk caused me to just-miss it, though. Among other things, the fifteen-minute walk to my interview gave me a chance to reflect on my outfit. I was wearing a light pink skirt, a black cardigan, my lace-up Chinese shoes, and white tights. It was the white tights I didn't like. They took the outfit from sweet to childish. Unfortunately, it was too warm for my black tights, the wrong outfit for my brown ones, and too cool for bare legs.   As I rounded the corner of my destination, a cyclist whirred passed me wearing black... stockings . That's what I needed. Black stockings. I had fifteen minutes to sort something out. That wouldn't be so difficult in NY or NJ but Malmö doesn't have a well-stocked CVS on every corner. It's not a city built for frivolous emergencies. You can't even buy Tylenol anywhere but a pharmacy. And when I say pharmacy I don't mean Duane Reade, either. I mean a real pharmacy, where they wear lab coats and give advice on eczema. Not being in the central, shopping-friendly area of the city, there wasn't even an H&M in site. My best shot seemed to be a big supermarket. Good instincts. I got the stockings and a bottle of water to cool my building sweat.   Having had stockings, I was sure the store would also have a bathroom. No. The cashier pointed to the bus station across the street. "Gross," I thought. "Already bought them, must try," I thought. Then, "Oh, my God; hurry."   At the bus station I found a middle-aged woman cleaning a shit-strewn women's stall. I tried to ignore the shit and asked if I could use the toilet. "No," she said. I just lingered while she squeezed some blue soap on the defiled seat (but didn't actually clean it). Finally, with "well, okay nut-case," resignation, she waved me (complete with pink skirt, white tights, and bows on my shoes) into the shit-stall. At this point it was all business for me. I turned my back to the mess, tried to avoid stepping on the tile with bare feet, and emerged with my new black stockings, feeling both crazy and relieved. Now the outfit was a clincher.   I got to the office, sat on a sofa, and flicked through National Geographic. By the time I met the editor of the publishing house, there was no trace of my physical or mental illness. And I got the job.   I know!   It's not full time, and it's not well paid. But it is a real job in Sweden with a big children's publisher! The deal is this: I will basically be doing for them what I did for JLG. I will read, on a freelance basis, English-language young-adult novels that they are thinking about publishing. Then I will write an in-house review. If I like a book, my boss will read it. If I don't like it, she won't waste her time. The amount I work depends on me (and what they have available). This means I can continue to study Swedish next year while also doing this. Eventually, if my Swedish becomes good enough, I can read Swedish books as well.   I'm feeling really good about this. I've always known I could&nbsp; live  here but recently it's felt like I just might be able to build a life here. Between my time at Malmö Högskola and now this freelance position, I'm making some incredible contacts for future jobs.   This week I'm reading (unpaid) some books they've already published to get a feel for their lists. Some of the titles are familiar, some aren't. Next week, I'll pick up my first load of paid reading. From there, we'll see.   Monday evening, after a few hellish student presentations, I met up with Lernia folks. Needless to say, Purba, Andreas, and Ferenc (Celia is still in France) were mad happy for me. Purba told us that, in addition to her internship with a marine biology experiment in Lund, she has also been called to give a lecture at a university, with the possibility of a research position.  I'm beginning to understand why Denmark has gone all xenophobic and tightened their immigration laws. Watch out Sweden. Us immigrants aren't kidding.   wallpaper:  nothing. it's almost 1am.

      Nothing gets written when you have a fever, no matter how much there is to say. After a hectic week, Erik and I took the train to Hässleholm for a little r&r (royalty and recording). Along with Sture and Marie, we watched the Danish crown prince Frederick marry Mary Donaldson, an Australian girl he met in a bar in Sydney four years ago. Danish TV was exploding with the romance all week. Interviews, parties, yacht races, and concerts (other markers of the occasion were a special-brewed Carlsberg beer combining Australian and Danish hops, and a commemorative coin). The one concert I caught was strangely eclectic (opera, rock, folk) and surprisingly bad. Not bad in the way that Britney Spears is bad, bad in the sense that it was all very flat—at least what Britney lacks in talent she tries to make up for in glitz. I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed for Denmark—these are your famous people? Later on, Erik dismissed the show with a quick, “Danes can’t do music.”   But they can do weddings. We watched the entrance of the different royal families and Sture and Marie were mostly able to tell me which young buck was the crown prince of Spain and which brocade wearing lady was the Queen of Norway. When the bells announced the bride’s arrival at the church, Prince Frederick melted every Nordic heart with his tears. Mary has picked up the Danish language well but I’ve been wondering if she and Frederick still speak English to each other at home. When Mary walked down the aisle I could read the prince’s lips when he said, “You’re beautiful,” in English. Guess this royal couple is no better than Erik and&nbsp;I are when it comes to adapting a new language for their relationship.   Mary surprised the Scandinavians when she chose to be walked down the aisle by her father. In these parts, the bride and groom usually walk in together to show solidarity and equality in their choice. I say that’s boring. Clad me in white, cover me in a veil, hell throw in a few cows for my dowry but also take out the “man and wife” business and get real about me changing my name. I’m all mixed up when it comes to traditions.   As are the Swedes. There’s lots of talk about getting rid of the royal family here. I feel as if I  should  agree. Wasn’t there a time that I consider joining the ISO? Unfortunately, I think I may be a little bit of a royalist. I got nothing but pleasure out of Friday’s event.   A last note on the wedding. In order to marry Frederick, Mary had to renounce her Australian citizenship, convert from Presbyterianism to Lutheranism, and promise to give up custody of any future children in the case of a divorce. That last part stopped me. As cool as it would have been to have met  Prince  Erik of Sweden fours years ago in London, I’m not sure if I would ever feel comfortable promising to let go of my kids. Especially with today’s royal marriage problems.  Here’s a good link with pics for any other shameless wedding lovers out there: urlLink http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kongehuset/wedding/    After the wedding, Erik and I went to Johan’s house. The three of us made red-lentil soup, garlic bread, and roasted asparagus. Leaving the dishes on the table we embarked on our real mission: to write a song together. We decided it would be fun to do an easy cover just to “get loose.” We spent the next four hours perfecting a version of “I’ll be your mirror.” I have no problem with covers as long as they’re justified. You need to either truly looove a song and just want to sing it or feel like you might have a new take on the song. Our cover fits neither of these criteria. The song was chosen for its simplicity and the new version doesn’t attempt anything revolutionary except inserting an extra bar where it shouldn’t be. But this isn’t meant for any album—it was just for fun. We all had a blast, especially Johan. He played the song at least 100 times and none of us could sleep for it reverberating in our heads all night.   Turns out we didn’t have the energy to write any original songs. Besides, Johan wanted me to write lyrics and a melody on the spot and I was too embarrassed.   I woke up the next morning sick of Nico and just plain sick. I hadn’t drunk that much the night before but I thought my ill feeling must be a result of too little sleep and too much booze. Shivering and aching, I made it through the day and even to a party back in Malmö. By that time I had almost no energy to talk and was relieved when the partiers’ attention turned from socializing to watching the Eurovision Song Contest.   I laughed at the rampant bad English and cheered as the Swedish song climbed the charts. When it was over and Sweden had come in fifth, I excused myself from the party and walked home.   To be continued tomorrow. Right now I have to go to the store and buy something for dinner. Then I’ll come home and heat up an apple pie for Erik’s name day (I think I’ve explained this before. Every day of the year has a name or two attached to it. You “celebrate” the day that has your name.). It’ll be good for him to have some pie, especially since he was just rejected for a market research survey about men who do grocery shopping. He spent almost 15 minutes on the phone before fumbling a question about aluminum foil and getting disqualified. Goodbye $45.

      I opened the newspaper to find a little nugget of good news tucked among gruesome headlines.&nbsp; A summer music festival in Malmö. In Folkets Park, which is basically on my door step. Normally I hate festivals (and any show with more than 3 bands) but the proximity of this one means I could easily slip away for a mid-festival nap or run home to pick up a cold beer. The line-up includes current faves:   The Shins The Fiery Furnaces Jens Lekman Franz Ferdinand   "Hej!," I thought."Men nej," I realized.  July 6th. The very day I return to America.   Even more infuriating than missing out on the bands, is the idea of missing a party in my own backyard. I've put in my time here, in the dead months, in Malmö in general and in Folkets Park specifically. Who else dragged themselves out of their sickbed on the coldest January night to go to Vinterland? (entry 01.05.04) And was anyone else in the neighborhood so buoyed by the new ferris wheel? (entries 03.16.04, 03.11.04)   Okay, my little park doesn't love me like I love it. But if it had to dump me, did it also have to begrudge me love from someone else by holding its festival at the very time Erik would be accompanying me to the airport?   Oh Folkets Park! You've hurt me but I'm not broken. Just wait until you hear about all the fun I've had in NYC. Prospect Park, Central Park! Bigger, handsomer, older parks. You'll go crazy with envy and beg for my heart back in August.   Right?

      I just had to check my appointment book before responding to a student. For the first time in seven months, I feel genuinely  busy . This is a good thing.   The meetings with students are slowly building, and my mind is swimming with half-thought-through theses statements for books I haven’t read. Today my meetings were about  White   Teeth ,  The Color Purple  (which I did read in 12th grade), and  Going After Cacciato  (a book that will forever remind me of my dearly pretentious high-school boyfriend). Tomorrow it’s more haven’t-reads and a follow-up meeting with one of my Graham Greene groups.   To be honest, I’m not sure how much I’m helping these students. They seem to be under the impression that I can give them something to write about whereas I was under the impression I would give feedback on the ideas they already have. It’s harder than I expected to help them think of ideas. For the books I haven’t read, the problem is obvious. For the ones I have read, I have to be careful not to enforce my own ideas. But when two students who have just finished  Travels with My Aunt  stare at you beseechingly and finally say something like, “We could talk about how travel affects him,” it’s hard not to “drop” a better idea.   These meetings exhaust me. I try hard to ask the right questions to get the students thinking but I often feel like they leave dejected, having expected more from me. At the same time, I feel irritated at their seeming lack of creativity and at the assignment itself. For the record, I despise both group projects and presentations, especially for a literature class. By and large I think graded group work results in tame ideas, since people are often too nervous to make suggestions and allow one person’s thoughts to dominate. Also, what in God’s name is the point of presenting a novel to people who haven’t read it? Boooring! And most importantly, how can these people focus on writing a good essay/thesis statement when they’re distracted by the idea of creating a dynamic presentation? It would serve their critical development much better if they were forced to think through a 7-10 page essay. (What a curmudgeon I sound like!, “Kids today! When I was in school we knew how to  write .)   In much worse shape than these struggling Swedes is a young guy from Cameroon that I’ve had two one-on-one tutoring sessions with. For our first session I planned to help him go through an essay he was asked to re-write. I asked him to read the essay out loud to me before I read it myself. Usually this helps people to self-correct as they go along or to see awkward sentences. I soon realized that this technique only works for those students who can write down basic thoughts in English. This student, whose level was far below what I expected, had no sense of what a good or bad sentence should sound like and, therefore, read through even the most undecipherable fragments without the slightest self-conscious pause. It was as if the paper he was holding hadn’t come out of his head.   I quickly realized that we couldn’t talk about the existing essay, as there was nothing to discuss. Instead I spent an hour trying to get him to talk about the story and tried to explain the concept of the thesis statement. I had been using the phrase “main idea” for a good half-hour before he asked me what “main” meant. (This guy must have been heavily dependent on his French-English dictionary when writing since within the essay he used words like “erroneous” and “combatant”.) We ended the session with me telling him to send me a thesis statement over the weekend. We planned to meet again on Monday. Instead of sending me his “main idea” on Sunday night he told me he had a new draft. Wow, I thought, that’s progress. Not quite. This new draft was at least as muddy as the first. I spent almost two hours trying once again to finagle a workable idea out of him. When we parted, we were both sluggish and significantly less hopeful than after our first session. He broke a meeting with me today because he “had to go to the hospital” but assured me that he’d “just write another draft.” I warned him against it and once again suggested he send me an idea for his new draft before embarking on it.   Then I had a chat with my mentor. As sweet as this student is, and as much as I want to help, I think this case is out of my league. Plain and simple, he is not ready to attend University in English. Someone has to tell him that but it's not going to be me.   Feeling a mixture of satisfaction and frustration, I came home yesterday to find an email from the editor-in-chief of the major children’s publisher in Malmö. I had emailed her two months ago about an internship but she never got back to me. Seems now that they need someone to read (English?) manuscripts and she wants me to come in for an interview. Well la di da… I’m not sure what she has in mind, or if it will be paid, but I love that she sought me out. I think I might have the upper hand here, until, that is, I open my mouth and expose my non-editorial-level Swedish.   Speaking of, I just totally bombed the last (God help me!) of many standardized Swedish tests. It was so hard, I didn’t even care. There was no sense of “oooh, I know that.” There were only wild guesses, and a lame-ass essay about Cate and her upcoming visit to Swedenland. It’s okay, this school gives the same test to everyone to determine their level and subsequent group. The answer: remedial+.

      Yesterday was bizarre but ultimately fun. We had this group trip to Österlen, which has been described as the Provence or Tuscany of Sweden. I’ve been to Tuscany, and Österlen really doesn’t look much like it; I have a feeling the same goes for Provence. Not to say Österlen isn’t pretty. It’s a charming area of farms, apple orchards, villages, and a cliff-studded Baltic coastline. It’s not as famous as either of the aforementioned areas; I doubt there are famous paintings depicting the Swedish fields, and I’m positive no movie exists about an American divorcee moving to Österlen and discovering herself. So much the better—you can admire the landscape without feeling like a cliché.   The group ended up being huge—four different classes and their teachers together. The bus was even bigger. I always find riding in chartered busses embarrassing, especially when they are double-deckers.   I was nervous to spend a whole day with my group but without my anchors. Célia is still in France and Purba’s internship with a marine biology experiment in Lund demanded her presence. Who would I sit with on the bus? Who would I talk to while walking? I really hate feeling like an unpopular fifth grader at this age.   I passed the jounrey with an extremely nice, yet somewhat unintelligible classmate. Unfortunately, there are only so many times you can ask the same person, “what?” without giving offence. Instead I answered questions that weren’t asked and pretended to understand his responses to questions that were. It was two hours of painful misunderstandings, punctuated by me attempting to read “The Nation.”   Once we arrived at Stenshuvud National Park, I spent most of my time with Andreas and Ferenc, walking up the trail with the former and down with the latter. I had been feeling melancholy recently, ostensibly reluctant to leave my class but really sad at not seeing Purba, Célia, Andreas, and Ferenc as often. I was soothed a bit when Ferenc suggested meeting up regularly during the internships. I told my teachers-cum-friends that they felt to me like parents, forcing me out of the house before I was ready. Ferenc laughingly assured me “Du kan alltid komma hem,” (you can always come home…).   The picnic started out slightly awkward. I sat down with my pathetically diminished class (more than Purba and Célia were missing) but none of us initiated conversation. Maybe the sun made us too tired to struggle. Ferenc again saved the day by bringing Andreas and a bottle of wine over to our area. The three of us polished off two and half bottles, a bit much for 2pm. But, I thought, if I have to go through another three hours navigating the space between fun with my teachers and awkward moments with my classmates, I might as well ask the wine for help.   The bus ride from Stenshuvud to Glimmingehus castle was more fun than the first leg. Ferenc invited me for a beer “downstairs” with him and Andreas. I was so relieved; I didn’t even try to play it cool. Unfortunately, after Glimmingehus, I returned to the student area of the bus. Although I truly like my riding partner, I couldn’t sit through any more strained communications. I put on my headphones and closed my eyes.   Once back at Lernia, everyone except the teachers dispersed for home (we had set off at 9am and it was now 5:15pm). I had to pick up some official papers from Andreas and Ferenc, so I followed them inside. As I was about to leave, they invited me to join the remaining teachers for  another  beer. I was wary but was assured that it wasn’t weird.   We sat at a bar relatively close to my apartment. Earlier in the day I had used a Swedish word, "lökigt," that translates directly to “onion-y” but means more “depressing, gross, dated, onion-y, pathetic” to describe Tom Selleck. Ferenc had never heard it before. At the bar, he told the other teachers I had taught him a new word. They looked to Andreas and me to explain what it meant. I said, “Well for example, Lernia is kind of 'lökigt'”. Had I not had so much wine and beer and sun in me, I probably would have thought twice about insulting the employer of everyone I sat with. As it was, they cracked up, and I felt like I had both successfully described “lökigt” and earned my place at the table.   What had been a strange day ended in a pleasant evening, which lead to an odd night. I came home, hastily cooked some “chicken” nuggets and rice, and passed out while watching “To Have and Have Not” with Erik. By midnight I had been drunk, slept it off, and was already feeling slightly hung over. Sometime between 1am and 2am I managed to force my buzzing brain to sleep.

      It’s been intermittently warm here since mid-March but I haven't yet been able to retire my winter coat. Today it felt like spring finally won the battle—the cold won’t come back in any real sense for another five months. Erik and I had plenty of work ahead of us when we woke up but it seemed almost inhuman to stay inside. After a fairly productive morning, we left the apartment to join Fredrik and Sara-Lisa on the beach.   One of Malmö’s best qualities is that the coast is actually part of the city. When you are at the beach, there’s no sense of having left Malmö. Our apartment is only a bike/bus ride away. The beach was crowded and lacked the usual whipping Malmö wind. Erik and I had on jeans and long-sleeved shirts but their were plenty of over-eager topless sunbathers (all lying on their stomachs).   Yesterday Erik and I popped into our new favorite store, Miracle Priser, to check out the bargains. Aside from the usual crap (ugly candles, cheesy underwear, and placemats), we found a few good buys: a blow-up globe, which we gave to Nils later in the evening, some miniature Swedish flags (used for holiday tables), and best of all, a bocci set, which we brought to the beach today.   Bocci, not being physically strenuous or mentally complicated, seems like one of those games that anyone should be able to win at. And yet, it’s not. Someone who will beat you at basketball or risk will probably also beat you at bocci. For Erik and I, Sara-Lisa and Fredrik are these type of people. It’s not that we can never win games against them; just this Friday I beat Frederick at Mafia (a party game). But winning against them feels like a fluke, like a moment of weakness on their part, not talent on mine.   Besides making Erik and I feel like the weaker couple, bocci was fun. We even futilely challenged the winners to a re-match.   After the beach, Erik, Frederick, and Sara-Lisa all went to their respective soccer practices and I came home and finished  1984 . The last few days spent reading it have been a pleasure—it was at both creepier and more engaging than I expected.   Reading, beaching, and bocciing are nice ways to spend a Sunday. I hope this portends a week more enjoyable than last. Friday was not a nice day. After my oral exam in the morning, I went straight to Malmö Högskola to post a schedule of meeting times to discuss the students’ final projects. After two hours of wrestling with Excel and three different computers, I finally managed to print out my schedule. During this two hour annoyance, I encountered other smaller irritations.&nbsp; I tripped and fell flat on my face in front of a few stunned people while trying to write a text message and walk up stairs at the same time. Possibly more embarrassing, I yelled “Berndt!” and ran after some guy who turned out not to be Berndt at all. To top things off, I got a call for Andreas when I got home, which rendered all my struggles pointless. A class outing that had been postponed until May 15th was back on for this Wednesday. This means I am, in fact, not free for meetings on Wednesday and must redo the schedule before the students have a chance to see it.   Aside from the schedule annoyance, Andreas's news was good. Our class is going on a day-trip to Österlen together. I’ve been to Österlen a bunch (most recently with my parents) but it will be fun to see the area with my classmates, whose dreadful company I missed all last week.   Ice cream and popcorn on the beach do not a satisfying meal make. Now I must cook dinner.  &nbsp;  Wallpaper: War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength

      You know you’re turning Swedish when you prefer a tie to a win. Last night Sweden played Denmark in the European cup. We had Purba, Johan, and Célia over to watch the game. It’s so much better to watch the games with a group of friends; Erik and I alone just can’t work up the necessary buzz, and our cheers echo too loudly in the empty apartment. Last night, the screams that erupted when Sweden scored their second goal and tied Denmark 2-2 shook the fixtures. Denmark and Sweden are both moving on to the semi-finals, leaving Italy behind, and sparking Italian talk of a “Nordic conspiracy.”   I have more Swedish pride than the Swedes, I think. As I sat down to watch the game last night, a loathing of Denmark that I had never experienced before started to bubble up inside. I started thinking things like, “Who do they think they are? How dare they challenge us! They’re just a fake Sweden, anyway.” Célia and Purba were the same. Célia said simply: “I usually like Danish people but right now I \\hate\\ them.” Purba took a more ruthless approach by wishing the Danish players injuries. Erik and Johan didn’t join in spewing the vitriol. Erik went so far as to say that he liked the Danes. This is because the Swedes make a point of repressing (often unsuccessfully) any notions of being better than anyone else. Being American, I don’t have that problem. And neither, it would seem, do my French and Indian friends.  My feelings towards the Danes warmed as soon as the game ended and I was affected by a wider, more Nordic pride. The sight of the Danish and Swedish players (many of whom happen to be drippingly hot, by the way) running arm in arm across the pitch was almost too much for this American. I had to fight off the tears with a chug of beer—a truly Swedish move.  The Swede/foreigner dichotomy was present all day, even before the game. Erik and I spent two hours in the immigration office, waiting to renew my visa. Erik was very frustrated with the lines and the crowds and commented despairingly, “Is this what immigrants have to go through?” We both brought reading but there was too much people watching to be done to read. The room was packed with people whose stories I was dying to learn and tried to guess. A family in front of us especially intrigued me. The husband was white (Swedish?), in his fifties, and wearing a suit. At first I thought he was stuffy but my opinion of him skyrocketed when I saw how very affectionate he was to his young, half-Chinese daughter, who was talking on and on about her Super Mario Bros gameboy game. She spoke English with an American accent to her father, and Chinese to her mother. And soon, I’m assuming, she will learn Swedish.   This little girl in a pink dress and cowboy boots was one example of the many beautiful children in the room who came from mixed marriages. Apparently “Swedish” is a good mixer. In about ten years, the teenagers with two Swedish parents are going to have to compete with a lot of half-Swede hotties.  After a mini-interview, I got my visa extended and can officially live and work here until August 2005. Det känns bra. (It feels good.)  The day after feeling my Swedish identity so intensely, my American one will come charging back. In less than two hours I’m going to meet Cate at the train station and will have ten days of loud, American, fun. Tomorrow we’re driving to Johan A’s summer house, to spend midsommar on the coast. I’m excited to show Cate the Swedish countryside and introduce her to some pseudo-friends. More than anything else, though, I’m glad I’ll have a true friend at the party.  Glad midsommar (June 25)!

      A fairly quiet week draws to a close. You know you need some excitement in life when the highlight of Tuesday for both Erik and me was when I allowed him to peel off my cucumber peel-off mask. He was totally fascinated by the product and quite taken aback when he turned around to see my face tight and shiny, slathered in gel. He gave a short yell and then came up close to examine. The whole episode made me realized how even boys who vacuum, do the dishes, and iron can still be mystified by womanly routines.   After the peel, Erik promptly found some miniscule little blemishes on his own face and asked meekly if he could try  the mask himself. Like letting a child have a sip of wine, I spread a little gel on his chin. Ten minutes later, I peeled it off, much to his delight.  The week continued with books and rain and one more peel-off mask. I'm not sure if it's the change in weather, a change of moisturizer, or a change in hormones but my face has suddenly returned to its 16-year-old troubles. This is especially funny considering I found gray hairs in my eyebrows this morning.   Yesterday Sture picked us up and we came to Hässleholm to watch the Sweden vs. Italy game. It was an exciting match, with the Swedish player Zlatan (from Malmö!) scoring a goal with the back of his heal in the last five minutes, making the score even. A note on my gambling ways of last weekend: I've kicked the habit, or it kicked me. After a few games, my luck ran out and my interest in the European Cup, though still high, started to wane just a smidgen.  Before we came to Hässleholm yesterday, we looked at an apartment. Erik and I always have it in the back of our mind to move if we find a better place but we're not actively looking. I saw a sign in a coffee shop for an apartment swap (common here). The guy wanted a one room; he had a two bedroom. It was more money than we wanted to spend but it was cheap for a two bedroom, so we gave the guy a call.  The place was ugly and depressing but it was a good excercise. I came back to my little apartment with new eyes and saw all its cozy charm. It's not perfect but until we find a beautiful place with wood floors and old moldings, it will do fine.  Sture's brewed the coffee and is calling for Erik and me to come downstairs.

      I can't believe it but Thursday with the Högskola crowd actually turned into a wild night. On Friday I spent most of the gray day watching TV, reading, grocery shopping, and cooking lunch. Erik plodded away at his essay. By 6 pm I was feeling restless and Erik, finally finished, was officially on summer break. We had originally planned to go for a celebratory drink but when the time came we were both craving a quieter party. I had gotten a package that day from my parents including various almuni magazines and some of their leftover kroner! We used the bonus money to eat at the fancy veggie restaurant. It has a cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and fresh bread and hummus for the tables. Unfortunately, we both opted for the cheapest dish--the tofu burger. Erik had eaten that the first time we went there and it had been great. Six months later, the bun was gone, replaced by a little teeny bread round, and the burgery patty had been traded in for large pieces of smoky tofu. It was pretty but it didn't compare to their previous effort. Also, I felt like there were a few too many contrasting flavors going on. The potatoes (which were really good) were crusted in sesame seeds and fennel seeds, the latter of which I normally avoid. The smoky burger was topped with apple salsa, and on the side of the plate was a garlic dipping sauce. It's a rare tofu dish that's too flavorful but this one was.   Luckily Erik didn't share in my disappointment and we still enjoyed our date. The relief he was feeling was palpable and I was glad to have him back after a week of stress. After dinner we rented "The Station Agent" and ate popcorn and candy.  Yesterday evening we were invited by Frederick and Sara-Lisa to watch the first two European Cup football/soccer matches at their house. I have been known to enjoy a professional soccer match now and again. Or more accurately, I haven't always whined when Erik or Teddy has turned one on. Jumping from not hating soccer to spending my Saturday night watching it is a bit of a stretch. It's amazing how a little money can up the interest level, though.  Before the games, which incidentally were Portugal vs. Greece and Spain vs. Russia, we decided to place a bet with a betting agency. I was in the presence of three true European soccer fans so they explained the odds to me. Portugal would definitely beat Greece and Spain would in turn beat Russia. Boring, I thought and tried to convince them that we should take one risk and one safe bet. I said I wanted to vote Greece and Spain as the winners. They smiled and said "interesting" but I could tell what they were really thinking was "Oh, she's trying. How sweet, yet stupid."   The whole betting card thing was really confusing and by the end of it we decided not to go in on one bet but to each do our own card that would predict the outcome of 13 games. Since everyone was too busy to help me and I was only wagering $2, I filled mine in based on intuition. First two: Greece and Spain. Then I started to get into the spirit of things and suggested to Erik that he and I do our own bet just on last night's games. I left him to handle the placing, thinking he knew about my Greece leanings, and went into the boutique next door. Turns out he bet $6 on Portugal winning 2-0. I was very disappointed and wasn't sure I wanted to give him my $3. He argued, fairly, that I left him with no directions, but also agreed that I didn't have to be a part of the bet.  And what do you know? The first game of the European Cup is a huge upset. Greece wins 2-1! The next game was Spain vs. Russia and Spain was favored to win. The crazy thing was that by half-time neither Spain nor Russia had scored. This made me nervous, as I had bet for a Spanish win, not a tie. Into the second half, the camera panned to the sidelines and I saw number 21, Valeron, preparing to go in. Not knowing anything about him, I turned to Erik and I said, "That's my man, Erik. He's going to come in and score." Five minutes later, he did and Erik and I almost fell off the couch in excitement and disbelief. Spain won 1-0. I now have the first 2 of my 13 picks right (I'm the only one of the night who's still in the running for money!). Of course, having the remaining 11 correct is almost impossible (especially now that's I've jinxed it by writing about my wins) but my interest in the cup has skyrocketed. It's a good thing too since I would probably have been forced to sit through a fair number of the games anyway.  After the games, the four of us played a dice game (we had done a bet during the Spain game on the exact number of goals scored and none of us were right, which meant a small pot remained). Then, with the help of an emergency call to Teddy, I taught them Kariki. Frederick won and Erik got an amazing five karikis in one game (no low roller). We moved on to the silly sound game I made up at Oberlin and then to charades. By the time we left at 2:30, the sky was already lightening. Swedish Summer is upon us.   Wallpaper:  Football, yo. Tonight's games are England vs. France and Croatia vs. Switzerland. The England/France game should be interesting and a little nervewracking. I have my money on an English win or a tie. France is good, though, really good.

      This week has passed in a blur of young-adult novels, two for work and three for pleasure. In anticipation of seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I decided to read the series again. Although I consider myself a big fan, I’m afraid fanatics would call me a lightweight, having read each of the five books only once. I’ve never been one for reading novels twice. I'd love to but the idea often stresses me out when I think of how much else there is to read. I’m pretty sure I can name all the novels I’ve read more than once: The Scarlet Letter, Would You Please Be Quiet, Please? (okay, it’s a collection of stories but that counts), Pride & Prejudice, and A Wrinkle in Time. There are probably a few I'm missing but regardless, the list is pathetic for an English major. If you add the first three Potter books, the count almost doubles.   For some reason, though, I was really excited for the new Harry Potter movie and wanted to get back into the world beforehand. I started the first book on Sunday and finished the third yesterday afternoon. Re-reading them was pure pleasure but I forced myself to put down the series for big chunks of time so that I could read one of the novels I picked up on Friday. It was painful to tear myself away from Harry and co. to immerse myself in a fairly inane book about mermaids and time-travel (one of the many post-HP attempts to cash in on the fantasy market). I think I have something against mermaids. They always strike me as utterly ridiculous, even when I lap up other fantastical creatures like hippogriffs and mandrakes. Or maybe it’s because they are often portrayed as almost human (and therefore sub-human), rather than scarily not.  During the three days, although we were both home, Erik and I hardly exchanged a word. I was too engrossed in my imaginary worlds and Erik was clogged in his real-life schoolwork. Last night, we both took a break from our texts and behaved like normal humans who eat dinner, relax, and go to the movies.  Although there was much left out of the new HP movie, I think it’s by far the best of the three. As with the LOTR trilogy, some (not all) of the additions/changes to the plot actually made it better. In Fellowship, I much preferred Arwen riding across the river and saving Frodo from the ring-wraiths and in Prisoner of Azkaban, I loved the realistically teenage bits, particularly an early scene in the boys dormitory where Harry, Ron, et. al. are goofing around in the face of gloom.  Without coming up for air, I launched into another YA novel yesterday, this one about a teenage vegan who’s seemingly got it all figured out until her world is turned upside down by a wild-child. Clichéd? Totally. A welcome break from magic and monsters? Definitely.   In twenty minutes, I have to leave for a staff picnic with Malmö Högskola. I don’t want to go and am nervous I’ll have no one to talk to. It’s my last hurrah there, though, so I’ll try to survive the awkwardness.   Erik looks poised to pull the last of the season's all-nighters before handing in his final essay tomorrow. He promised to take me out for a drink after. This weekend we might brave the Nordic summer and attempt to swim.

      Erik had an end of term party with his class last night. I could have joined him but felt happier to give him the night with his classmates and chose instead to meet Katja for a calm beer on Möllevångstorget, the local hip square. I returned at around 10pm feeling a little restless and, after fidgeting around the apartment for a while, fell in to a sound sleep at 11:30. Out of habit, I had bolted the door, which meant I had to get up to let Erik in when he got home at 2, a little worse for wear. Without talking much to him, I climbed back to bed and he collapsed next to me, starting to snore the second his head hit the pillow. Somewhere at around 6am, I woke up to the sound of Erik slamming open the silverware drawer. I was about to get up and investigate when I saw him run to the bathroom. I thought for sure he was sick and went to see if he needed me. "Are you throwing up?" I asked. "No," he said. "What are you doing with a knife or fork?" I asked. No answer. "Erik," I continued, "why did you open the silverware drawer?" "I have no idea," came the nauseous reply. I gave up and returned to bed.  Needless to say, he was still in bed when I left for my meeting at Richter's. An hour later, I returned, laden with a stack of manuscripts, and opened the door to a guilty groan from the bed area. Still recuperating. After a shower, some lunch, and a good confrontation with his fylleångest, Erik was ready to join me in going to town to search for a birthday present for Katja, who's having a party tomorrow night.  We spent hours roaming around before finding anything suitable. At one point I got excited about a "make your own lip-balm" kit but Erik was less enthused. It can be hard to give a gift as a couple, since girly things I might buy for a friend (I had a look at some schmancy body lotion) don't really work as gifts from Erik. Eventually we settled on alcohol. Erik's idea was to buy the ingredients to make cosmopolitans but buying Cointreau and vodka (not to mention the cranberry juice) ended up being mad expensive. We had to limit ourselves to a one-liquor gift. I was into Lemoncello; he was less so. In the end, we decided on making a little "Hot Shot" gift set.  For those of you that haven't had a hot shot, the recipe is:  1 part hot coffee 1 part Galliano liqueur whipped cream  Layer the coffee and Galliano in a shot class and then top with a dollop of lightly whipped cream. I've never actually tried one of these so I can't vouch for their flavor but they seem like a tasty pick-me-up when your party groove starts to lag. Apparently these hot shots are popular in America, but I had never seen one before the other weekend. The Swedes love them, though. Those of you who enjoyed the Christmas schnapps song will be happy to hear that hot shots have their own little ditty. Sing in a hearty voice (reminiscent of Tomte Gubbar), "Koka kaffe! Vispa grädde! Hot shot, hot shot, hot shot!"  For Katja we bought one bottle of Galliano, some classic Swedish coffee, whipping cream, and six cheap shot glasses (courtesy of Miracle Priser). We're both satisfied with the gift and participated equally in creating it, always a plus.  Right now Erik is napping. Soon, I'm going to wake him up and prod him to start an essay--his last one of the semester. I really don't feel like cooking tonight so I'm also going to try to convince him to take time away from his essay to get some dinner out. There's a relatively affordable Vietnamese place that we haven't tried with a few tasty sounding veggie options.   Almost all of our friends are going to a graduation party tonight. An acquaintance of ours, who I've always really liked is finishing med school. Unbelievably though, only Erik got an invitation to the party tonight. When he asked if I could come, the guy said, "Oh, I'm really sorry but we don't have enough room." I am totally offended by this. Except in rare circumstances, you just don't invite only half a couple that lives together to a big party. This is not a case where Erik is clearly closer to this guy--when we've seen him, it's almost always been together. So basically I'm royally pissed off and Erik is staying home in protest.   It's probably a good thing that we're not going. If I went out tonight, I'd be less in the mood for Katja's party tomorrow. Besides, we have some bad movies to watch. The other night I signed up for the Swedish version of Net Flix to get the three free trial movies. Since rules are boring in English and even worse in Swedish, I skipped reading them. When I told Erik he pointed out that we'd probably get a bill if we didn't cancel. He was then forced to read all the fine print and cancel my subscription. Due to the speedy internal mail in Sweden, the three trial movies were sent before we cancelled, but we have to watch them before Monday to prevent being billed. The fact that one of the movies that was sent is Vin Diesel's XXX, brings the number we will watch down to two: K-19: The Widowmaker, and some Swedish thriller.   Think we'll keep things light and go with K-19 tonight.

      Just returned from another semi-wasted day at Högskola. It was up to me to organize the last of the presentation days—an afternoon where anyone who had missed out on presentations throughout the semester could make it up. I received emails from about ten people saying they would come. I spent the morning making a stupid grading sheet for myself in Excel and then went over at 1pm. Only four people showed up.   I have no complaints about an unexpected free afternoon but I think the lack of students  speaks to a problem with the Swedish education system. It’s just not tough enough. These make-up presentations (and the make-up exam tomorrow) are not only for people who failed the first time or who had a medical or family emergency. By and large, the students who do make-ups just didn’t show up for the first exam. I can’t imagine that. Oh, there’s an exam that I’ve known about for months on the schedule. Eh, I’ll skip it. What? But this is what Swedish students are allowed to do, with absolutely no penalty.   Here you can write and re-write essays until you pass and take and re-take exams. On my way out today one student asked about the portfolio that she had to hand in (it seems she only wrote one essay of the five or so that should be in there). Her teacher told her half-laughing that according to law she had three years to hand in the finished product. THREE YEARS! The only downside to waiting would be that she wouldn’t earn the credits until it was handed in. Poor thing.  Growing up with these allowances has also lead to a certain amount of intolerance on the part of the students when they are academically challenged. I was told today that students have, in the past, lodged formal complaints against the department when exams were scheduled on consecutive days. What would they do during an American exam WEEK? I’ve been in a meeting where a student presented a chart that detailed the overlapping of heavy reading and essay writing over the semester--an actual graph that probably took as long to create as reading, say, sixty pages of a novel.   I really feel for the teachers who have to deal with this shit. Imagine having to correct the same piece of crap essay over and over until you’re willing to pass the student just to get them out of your life. Or having to write not one but multiple exams to accommodate the laziness of students who obviously don’t care about your class. How infuriating.  My high school had stricter standards. I remember stories of people crying because a teacher wouldn’t take their essay ten minutes after the deadline.   Whoever is in charge here has a misplaced sense of egalitarianism. Rather than helping weaker students who might need more time, the system plays on all of their weaknesses. Procrastinators are catered to, never forced to change, and forever destined to come in last. People who fail are comforted by the knowledge that they can try (and fail) again. Mature students are quickly separated from underdeveloped ones and the latter are never given the tough love that they need. The result is thirty-year-old students still whining about assignments. Or worse, me having to sit through a fifteen-minute presentation on Huckleberry Finn today where the thesis was: “Huck is a racist in the beginning of the book. Everyone can change.”   Seriously.

      Thank you, thank you, thank you. I slept like a regular person last night--insomnia conquered. Since I returned on Wednesday, I've been plagued by memories of January, when both Erik and I couldn't sleep for a week. Wednesday and Thursday nights were repeats of that. But last night, after a long day outside, a bad movie, a soak in the bath, and a good book, I fell asleep at 1:30am on the first try. Now I finally have the energy to post something about my trip back.  A few words of advice: Never fly to Copenhagen via FinnAir from JFK, stopping in Helsinki. Always listen to your father when he says your flight plan is stupid and not worth the $300 you saved him. My journey started at 2pm (American time) on Tuesday with the 2 hour drive to JFK, as opposed to the 15 minute drive to Newark. I hate JFK. It's a hulking ugly concrete beast that wears bellbottoms and doesn't own a computer. Nevertheless, I was in good spirits when I kissed my parents goodbye at 5pm and headed for the gate. I boarded the plan at 5:45 and was meant to leave at 6pm. One In Touch magazine,   one Bon Apetit, a ziplock bag of chex mix (thanks mom!), and three hours later, we took off. The flight itself was fine. I was tired enough to sleep almost the whole way, which meant that I wasn't as angered as I normally would be by the lack of personal tvs, which I have come to expect on international flights. The food was also good, not the tasteless asian noodle salad I got, but the tofurkey sandwhich on real rye that I brought with me.  I knew as soon as I had sat on the runway for 45 minutes that I would miss my connecting flight, so I was relatively calm when I did. We landed in Helsinki at 11:45am local time--my connecting flight left at 9:30am. So I followed the horde of disgruntled passengers, most of whom were flying to Moscow, to the information desk. From there I was sent to another, and then a third, and then a fourth desk. By this time, the small group of us flying to Copenhagen had all found each other. We were given day rooms in an airport hotel and told to come back at 5pm for our new flight.  I went outside just as the bus was arriving. It took me to an airport parking lot--oops wrong bus! Then I had to wait for another half hour since I missed the hotel bus. Once at the hotel, I called Erik and my parents to tell them my whereabouts then went up to my room, ate my last sandwhich, watched BBC world news, and then fell asleep while watching a Russian program in English on Swedish tv in Finland about Lattvia. Whew!  My next flight was delayed ten minutes, the baggage claim in Copenhagen was delayed ten minutes, the train back to Malmö was delayed ten minutes. I finally stepped off the train at Malmö central station at 7:30pm, instead of 11am. Erik was there waiting with a clean shaven face and strong arms to carry my bags. The good thing about my Finnish sojourn was that I was fresh when I met Erik, having napped and showered at the hotel. After dropping off my bags at home, we went out for Indian. And it felt good to be back.

      I just had my last soak in my parents' new hot tub before leaving for Sweden. To sit in the steaming water with a citronella candle... it was exactly what I needed after over 72 hours of non-stop chatting, laughing, and tearing up. It would have been even better had I been able to turn the bubbles on full force. Unfortunately it's loud when you do that and then I wouldn't have been able to hear if a greasy-haired, Bob from  Twin Peaks  like murderer was coming into the yard. And actually all the stress that the water melted away was quickly brought back as soon as I started thinking of that scenario.   The chatting and laughing and tearing up was done mostly at two events this weekend. Saturday, after seeing my brother play at an amphitheater, we all headed out to Sabine's relatively palatial and resortish apartment in Williamsburg for a little beer and bbq. We grilled veggie burgers and not-dogs, played a slapped together game of pictionary/win lose or draw, and danced till the wee hours, at which point I cried and said goodbye.&nbsp;Sam and I left some time around 3am, I got to Cate's place at 4 (f-ing subway), fell asleep at 5, and was up before 9.   By 1pm I had pushed my headache into some deep recess of my brain and was&nbsp;back in NJ, showered, and dressed in my new blue sundress. Then it was off to the shower.   At some later date, when it's not 12:30am and I'm not in half a wet bikini, I'll discuss at greater length the fact that my eldest brother, Teddy, is getting married to his lovely girlfriend, Jodi, in September.&nbsp;This is a huge deal to me, which counterintuitively is probably&nbsp;why I haven't mentioned it&nbsp;till&nbsp;now. And again,&nbsp;my emotions are already on edge and my brain is too muddled by heat and chlorine.   Jodi's bridal shower was yesterday. She got perfect gifts, I made the silly ribbon hat, we ate vegan petit fours, and my mom's pants fell down. Yep, the single funniest thing that has happened all vacation was when my mom stood up to graciously introduce my aunt to Jodi's mom. As she did her brand new drawstring pants dropped to her knees. While the rest of us nearly died from laughter, my wonderfully silly &nbsp;mom tried to ameliorate the scenario by dropping her pants again, sending all the ladies into convulsions. Can you say "ice breaker?"   And speaking of stripping...At dinner later on I brought up the old "what's your porn star name?." My parents, Jodi, Jodi's parents, and I laughed some more sharing our combinations. For those of you who don't know, this is how the game works. You take your first pet's name and add it to the name of the first street you lived on to come up with your porn identity.   For example, I am Coco Park. My dad is G.D. Chestnut and my brother is Private Cleveland.  I swear.

                 I'm a bad packer. Every year after college I threw my belongings into boxes five minutes before the long drive to New Jersey. Once home, the last thing I wanted to do was unpack. The boxes were brought upstairs to my brother's old room and left to be gone through some other time. Six years after the first box was left, "some other time" has come. The result is a pile of tic tacs, zip disks, and love letters (sometimes from the same ridiculous &nbsp;box) crowding the hallway.     I've thrown out the tic tacs, moved the disks, read the love letters. Now what I have left is&nbsp;a cluster of tchotchkes that I will sell on ebay. I have never sold on ebay before and have only bought five or six items through the years. But the past few days I've been hanging out at "The World's Marketplace" more than usual, getting ready for my auctions. So I'm curious...     1) What's the best thing you've ever bought on ebay?     2) The worst thing you've sold?     3) What are the most common search terms you use when browsing aimlessly? &nbsp;      My answers      1) A signed print by some guy who was part of the Abby Hoffman scene for Ben, my socialist ex. The print showed Jenny Marx holding a baby, asking her husband Karl when he would be done writing. Marx is sitting at a desk with a piece of paper in front of him that reads: "Das Kapital. Chapter 1."     2) Nothing yet.     3) 1. "Jane Austen". I'm still waiting for a signed copy of Pride and Prejudice (!) or a newly discovered short story to surface.&nbsp;   2. "Cabbage Patch Kid". Usually I'm indulging my nostalgic obsession looking for clothes and/or paraphernalia that will one day become a tchotchke that I sell. These searches always end in depression. I get bummed from seeing all the neglected babes being sold for peanuts. It feels like an illegal adoption site. Just look at this little guy, currently going for $5 with no bids:      &nbsp;       And now a sad story entitled: "No One Collects My Collectible"&nbsp;      One day long&nbsp;ago a woman named Lynda bought a Michael Jackson doll, complete&nbsp;with a silver glove. She put it away, far from her four children and waited. And waited. Every once and a while, while watching "Antiques Roadshow" she would think out loud, "I wonder how much that Michael Jackson doll is worth."&nbsp;&nbsp;      Twenty years later, her now grown up daughter was browsing on ebay. Lynda excitedly asked her to look up Michael Jackson dolls to see what they go for. A silence followed by laughter filled the room as Lynda, her husband, and her daughter were faced with the truth. The Michael Jackson doll has actually depreciated in value. The doll could hardly pay for chlorine, let alone the in-ground pool Lynda has always dreamed of.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lynda's heart was broken until she focused on the board game at hand. Deep down she knew she preferred being&nbsp;a trivial pursuit champion than an ebay maven.

      I'm still in the process of moving posts from Larien to here. Just now I finished moving&nbsp;May. If you're interested in seeing the pathology of my lyme disease, please refer to the posts of May 5, where I contract it, and May 19 and 20, in which I describe how sick I got from it.   Suddenly everything makes sense: the tiredness, the achy legs that I've had for two months. Can I blame my financial state and lack of permanent job on the disease too?   I just made the mistake of taking antibiotics on an empty stomach and will now go moan and groan and eat some toast.   p.s. What is this trackback function I have? Could that have helped me link to my old posts or something?

      Between seeing bands in crowded places, eating cheese fries&nbsp;in Coney Island, and losing to my parents at Trivial Pursuit, I've been monitoring my leg.  &nbsp;  Back when Cate was in Sweden we noticed a large blotch on my right thigh. Erik said it looked like someone sat on my lap and the mark never left. When it didn't go away after a few days, I started to get interested. I wasn't worried; I just chalked it up to another in a growing list of bizarre&nbsp;skin conditions I have had such as fungus, some little teeny bumps that are called lactospinulosis or something, and&nbsp;seborrheic keratoses. This last condition, which is characterized by small raised spots, isn't nearly as gross as it sounds.&nbsp;It is rare in young people and&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;increase with age. Greeeaat.&nbsp;Two or three on my back I can handle, legions of them covering my body I cannot.  &nbsp;  I came home to America and brought my blotch with me. Knowing exactly what my mom's reaction would be, I showed it to her. Ten minutes later I had an appointment with the dermatologist. I was sure he would take one look at my leg and dismiss the redness as a prosaic rash, give me some cortisone, and be done with it. Not so. I have never seen a doctor look so fascinated by something I've brought to the office. He poked with a childlike curiosity before remarking that "It's not every day you see this walk through the door." It's not??... He thought out loud for a minute, mentioning lyme disease and&nbsp;dismissing it&nbsp;in the same breath. He said he would consult his books and sent me off.  &nbsp;  Ten days later I haven't heard from him. I took this to mean he looked it up and found that it was nothing, my mom took it to mean that's he's an irresponsible quack who is sending me to my undiagnosed death. This morning when I came downstairs she asked to look at my leg. Not only was blotchy still there, I had two more outlined circles on my legs and one on my right arm. I agreed to go to the immedicenter first thing.  &nbsp;  I described my symptoms to the doctor who looked as confounded as the first. Through the examining room door I heard her say, "a very interesting case." (I'm glad I can add a little color to their days of strep and acne.) She came back to the room and told me she&nbsp;thinks it's  urlLink lyme disease . After some confusion, she discovered that&nbsp;lyme disease does exist in forested areas of Europe.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In May I had been hiking with my Lernia class. Although I was wearing pants, I did take them down in order to pee in the bushes. About a week later a bump on the back of my knee appeared.&nbsp;I thought it&nbsp;was a pimple until it turned into a violent (non-bulls eye) looking bruise.&nbsp;At the time I also had a high fever and was convinced I was dying from blood-poisoning. Erik and Katja talked me out of that and in 48 hours I was healthy again. Or so it seemed.   Today I got a blood test. Tomorrow or Wednesday I'll know. If it is lyme disease all it means is 20 days of antibiotics.&nbsp;&nbsp;   After my doctor's appointment I went to my dad's office where I found my aunt reading the symptoms of lyme disease off the internet. I grabbed the car keys, and left for my cousin's house. I forgot something and came back into my dad's office to find them  still  talking about it. For Christ's sake.  &nbsp;  I kind of hope it is lyme disease.&nbsp;At least then I'll/we'll know. If it's not,&nbsp;I have a feeling my mom will be making an appointment to take me to Cedar Sinai within the next ten days.

      A few observations from my trip:  1) There is always one mean stewardess. And I was trapped with her. She scowled everytime I asked for water, which, by the way, was twice. When the sound didn't work on my Inspector Morse mystery, I kindly asked if she knew what the problem was. She sneered and walked away. To where? To check out the problem? To attend to something else? To the break room? Wherever she went, the sound stayed scratchy and horrible until I eventually turned off the movie and read.  2) "Jersey Girl" is totally watchable, if you happen to be trapped in a stale tube for seven hours, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.   3) Airline companies are either out to punish all vegetarians or truly believe that we are all no fun. My main dish was totally fine but while everyone else got some sort of gooey pink thing for dessert, I got fruit salad. Our second meal was to be served an hour and a half before landing. Since I was bored out of my mind, I was actually looking forward to this and was especially excited when the smell of pizza began to fill the aisles. When the above-mentioned mean stewardess came with the cart, I looked up expectantly only to see her giving the girl next to me a little pizza box and providing me with a "special" meal. It was some sort of sprouted spelt sandwich and an apple. This time the pizza people got a chocolate mint gooey thing for dessert. I asked if I could also have the pizza. When they were "sure there was enough," mean-stewardess dropped it on my tray table without any knife, fork, or chocolate treat.   4) There are always certain bags on the baggage carousel that stay unclaimed for far too long. Where  are  these people? What happened to them between customs and the claim? Was there a bar tucked along the bare corridor that I didn't see? And if there really are people who aren't in a rush to get the hell out of the airport, couldn't the airline pack the bags accordingly? This way I wouldn't have to see the same green suitcase five hundred times before my bag surfaces from whatever abyss they apparently stuck it in.  Regardless, I'm now home and happy and hot. Eating too much, wandering around the house, making plans to see friends, and enjoying my first few days of real summer.

      About a month ago my mom sent me a package which contained, among other things, two essays I had written at Oberlin. When I saw them I groaned thinking, "this will be embarrassing." They weren't embarrassing, though, and that was much worse. Reading them, I was reminded of myself five years younger and, apparently, smarter. I don't know if I could write those essays today. Of course you could say it's just a matter of being outside an academic context but it still makes me feel thick.   It's like when I look at a basketball hoop; I can remember being in eighth grade, able to sink a shot from the far corner. But when I pick up the ball and try to shoot now, my body flails in awkward ways and I'm confronted with the difference between what I remember being able to do and what I can do today.   It's the same with Swedish really. Before I'm even fluent, I'm getting worse. I was progressing so steadily for a few months and then I went and passed the national test and finished with SFI. I haven't had classes since April and it shows. Yesterday I answered the phone when Erik was at football practice. I try to avoid answering the phone, finding it much harder to understand Swedish when I can't look at someone's mouth. This time, though, I thought I recognized the number. I also felt deep down that I am perfectly able to have a basic Swedish conversation and should not let the phone scare me.  I picked up and was assaulted by a barrage of unrecognizable Swedish sounds. "Excuse me?" I said. The man on the line mumbled something about being from a company and doing some research. Ahh, a telemarketer. I tried to make innocent sounds that would approximate "I understand you" until I could gracefully bow out of the call. Instead, he suddenly said, "You don't understand much Swedish, do you?" When I meekly agreed, he informed me that this "wouldn't work." In America I would have dismissed him with a short "we're not interested" or "take me off your list;" here, the telemarketer dismisses  me .   I sat there in stunned fury until I realized that his unwelcome honesty was useful. It was the first time in months that someone has insulted my Swedish instead of praising it. I know my declining Swedish is just a result of being out of practice and that it will come back quickly if I resume classes in the fall, but that doesn't mean I should give up on the language for the summer. I now plan on renting every Bergman movie ever made while I'm in America. Or at the very least I will practice saying, " Stick upp din undersökning i röven och ring aldrig hitt igen! " Shove your research up your arse and never call here again.

      We saw "Dawn of the Dead" last night. I think Erik might have bruises on his thigh from where I punched him out of nervousness. Afterwards, though, we both decided that the movie stole a lot from "28 Days Later," which was way better--one of my favorite movies of the past year.  Malmö was strangely quiet for a Friday night. I'm not sure if it is due to the fact that most Swedes take vacations in July or if everyone was just tired after the midsommar festivities of the week before. Our friends, at least, are not. Most everyone we hang out with is in Denmark this weekend at Roskildefestival, a massive music festival. The band list is great but I don't envy them at all. I have trouble with three-band shows when I know I'm going home after. The idea of four days of bands, no showers, way too much beer, and corny conversations in tents makes me cringe. I think the only way I could enjoy such an event would be if I was single and could spend my time staring at the multitude of cute Scandinavian boys. As it is now, I think I'd ruin both Erik and my time by whining.  Cate is also in Denmark after eight days in Malmö. It's strange to have her so close by and not be with her but she's lucky to have a friend in Copenhagen to show her the sights. My knowledge of that city is still very touristy. I haven't had a chance to write about Cate's visit. We had a fabulous time despite the cruel amounts of rain that fell on southern Sweden. We partied with the locals, swam in the freezing cold ocean in the middle of the night, paddle boated through the city, visited a viking village, took a turn on the ferris wheel, had fika, and talked deeply and stupidly for hours.   Tonight we're having dinner at a friend of Erik's apartment and tomorrow night at Purba and Johan's. My only other plans for the weekend are to read like a maniac before my meeting at Richter's on Monday. One more fairly long book to go before I pick up my "vacation load" and head off to America.  Time to wake up the sleeping Swede and push him into the kitchen, where I will shove a cup of coffee under his face and make him talk to me. Then I will read.

      A little less than a year ago, Juliet and I sat in the Grotto (a pizza place by our offices), sharing an eggplant parm sandwhich. For some reason we were discussing "blogs." I was a little late to the game and needed her to explain to me exactly what constituted a blog. And here I am, all grown up, starting my own. Although, I confess, I asked Juliet's advice before I did.  I've recently been feeling tired of my journal and it's low-tech look. I'm not sure if this site will actually be any more savvy, but it looks it, doesn't it? This site also enables comments, which is fun for me and might create more of a community feel.   Right now I can't import my other entries to this place but I hope to eventually be able to. In the meantime, I'll have to write like a mofo to make my new home feel less empty.  Välkomna!

      What I hate even more than the fact that these so-called Subway sandwich "artists" give Erik shit whenever he asks them to change their tuna-fishy gloves is that they are stingy.  It took some work on my part to convince Erik that we should have Subway for lunch today instead of going home for toast. (Could that be any more depressing?) So I wanted the meal (deal) to live up to my arm twisting.  As some of you, namely Cate, have heard me tell time and again, one of the first times I knew Erik was the guy for me was when we went out for Subway in London. While I was busy marvelling over the absence of banana peppers and the presence of corn, I heard Erik make a little dissatisfied grunt. I looked over to see him motioning with his hand to the "artist" behind the counter, "Could you evenly distribute those cucumbers?" Or something to that effect. I stopped my ordering, looked over at him with dewey eyes and thought, "love." Four years later he's ordering horseradish sauce and I'm all, "Is this the man I fell in love with?"  Anyway, I've accepted the fact that no Subway franchise will ever live up to the Oberlin establishment. Those townies knew how to make a sandwich! But the Subway here in Malmö is truly a disappointment. Like I said,  stingy . Today, after receiving a pittance of lettuce, I asked for more peppers. And then I had to ask for more than two olives and then as the "artist" reached for a pickle, I said exasperated, "Can I just have more of everything?"* It was all I could do not to climb over the glass case and make it myself. What do they think is in a veggie delight if it's not the veggies? In the end, once I sat down with my chips, my sub, and my fanta, the meal came together nicely.  About twenty minutes after lunch, while digesting in H&amp;M, I realized I forgot to ask for my subclub stamps. Arrgh!   *A note on the genetics of my dissatisfaction: My dad, five-cheese man, was actually fired as a cook in the army because he made the sandwiches too big.

      The bad news is that we paid for my plate of vegetables and soft tofu in a slimy sauce. The good news is that I can finally stop saying, "Maybe we should try that Vietnamese place..." everytime we're in the mood for Thai.  We washed the bad taste from our mouths with popcorn and Moonstruck.

      I'm looking for ideas. How does one have a summery day without spending too much time in the sun? Yesterday I spent the afternoon walking around Lund with Purba, Celia, Ola, and Emilie, Celia's cousin. The sun shone bright but I managed well. No buzzing and tingling or greater than average sunburn. Today what I'd really love to do is go to the beach. I don't want to sunbathe or anything crazy like that, I just want to sit there and read for a few minutes before dunking myself in the Öresund (the straight between Sweden and Denmark). The water temperature in Malmö is warm and the sun is downright hot but I think I should stay away. After writing about phototoxicity, I started to do a little "research" and found out that one disgusting side effect of doxyxycline-induced photosensitivity, is a possible separation of the finger nails from their pads.  So, the beach is out, at least until later afternoon or evening. Erik suggests we go to the maritime museum. I think maybe we should go shopping in thrift stores for a suit that he can wear to the wedding. Neither option sounds like a blast. At 7pm, though, we'll see a pop vs. hip-hop concert in the park, and that should restore the summerness to the day. Maybe we'll even have dinner outside. Then we can eat my leftover salsa from last night.  A few days ago I needed some mint for a recipe. At the farmer's market I had to buy a huge bushel or none at all. So, I've been forced to cook with mint much more than usual (actually, before this, I think I pretty much just stuck it in iced tea). Now I've made stuffed squash and haloumi with an olive-oil mint dressing (ooh la la), lemon and mint unchicken, ice cubes with mint leaves, and last night, something I was particularly proud of, due to its combination of ingredients rarely seen in my kitchen.   Amy's "The First Time I've Ever Had Both Radishes and Mint in My Fridge" Salsa  ingredients: -radishes -some sort of ripe tomatoes (I used cherry) -spring onions (preferably ones with big bulbs) -mint leaves (oh you know, a small bunch) -lemon  Chop radishes, tomatoes, and spring onions into small pieces. Finely chop mint leaves and combine with veggies. Squeeze a lemon wedge over the mixture. Salt and pepper to taste.   Erik and I ate this as a relish for our burgers but I think it would also make a good bruschetta topping, or filling for hummus and pita. Now I have some of every ingredient left over in my fridge so I guess I'll make more. I mean, what else can I do with a few scraggly radishes, fastly wilting mint, a de-zested lemon, and three cherry tomatoes?    * See Laurie Colwin's great "Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant."

      I just returned from an appointment with my city representative to talk over funding for my studies. Malmö, bless it, has paid me to study Swedish for the last six months--not much, but enough to live. (Their version of survival is not quite my own. I mean is a life spent worrying about every beer drank and movie rented a life worth living?) Regardless, I was under the impression that my allowance would continue through my next and last year of studying Swedish. That's not necessarily the case.  Now here I am, less than a month from when I am due to start classes and I'm still waiting on an answer. So I went to plead my case. It seems that the city is only willing to pay for an immigrant to learn Swedish up to the high school level. The course I am planning to take is meant to prepare you to study at Swedish university. I got all fired up and said that high school isn't enough and that it isn't fair that immigrants are only encouraged to learn mid-level Swedish and are, therefore, destined for mid-level jobs. He said calmly, "But Amy, you're not mid-level. You have no American accent; you have the right word order; and you can use all the prepositions in the correct way." Aaawwww shucks, really? Wait, no, don't distract me with compliments! The truth of the matter is that no matter how impressed you are with me, I can't understand every word you say and I  that ' s  the level I want to be at.  I didn't say this. What I did say was that the type of job I hope to get requires nothing less than perfect Swedish. He said with a grin, "Maybe you can't have that job but you might be able to find something else." Okay, "That's true, I said. But why I have I just spent the last few months in an  academic  program in Lernia, which encouraged me to find something in my field, if I am meant to abandon it in the end? What kind of professional job can I get right now without further education either in Swedish or in another field?" (Please don't say English teacher...)  Then I started to get all teary-eyed and he went to get someone else who knew about the course I propose to take. He came back with Svetlana. "She too is an immigrant that learned Swedish." (And?) Svetlana took out the course catalogue for Malmö Högskola and pointed out the Swedish course she thought I should be taking, completely ignoring the fact that to get into  that  course I need to have taken the one I'm signed up for. Then Svetlana left and I was confused as to why she had been in the room to begin with.  My rep promised to discuss my case with those above him. So now I have to wait. In the meantime, I will also look for jobs, which was my plan all along. Do these people really think I enjoy subsisting on their meagre salary? I mean, yes, I do and I'm grateful but, of course, I'd rather have a job I love.  I left the office feeling both dejected and powerful. It's not easy to have a financial meeting in Swedish, but it felt good to at least try to plead my case. And even if they don't give me the money, I actually wouldn't mind working at a bar or a restaurant for a little bit until I figure things out. There's no guarantee I could even find that kind of thing, though. I've looked before.  Speaking of difficulty finding employment...While I write, I am waiting for Erik to come home from his first day on the job as...a...mailman!!!!! He will be in good company; it's fairly common here to see a hot little Swede riding around on a little blue and yellow bike delivering the mail. Unfortunately, I don't think Erik got to ride a bike today. He was supposed to work with the packages or something.  What a couple, heh? Me demanding money that was pretty insane to get in the first place and Erik's advanced studies in media and communication being put to real use. What? Letters, packages, junk mail...it's all communication.  Getting the mail was, actually, the highlight of my day so far. Not because of pride for my boy's new employer, no. Because we received Teddy and Jodi's wedding invitation! It's funny, I mean, there was no shock there--I knew it was on it's way. Yet still, seeing it drop through the slot got me all choked up. I can't wait to send my little reply card.  For now, though, I have to work. Teen romance awaits reviewing.   **Update: I got the money! Now, if Erik starts to make millions through the post we'll reevaluate, but for now it's good news. Oh, and Erik did get to ride a bike.

      Argh! This quiz, courtesy of  urlLink zoot , was fun/frustrating/mind-numbing.  I got a 70, although I was totally screwed out of a few due to spelling or tense errors.      urlLink

      It's gray and cool and I'm happy. Not because I've finally grown accustomed to the rainy conditions of latitude 55* North (Malmö, Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Moscow) but because I can go to the farmer's market without slathering myself in sunscreen. I know it seems extreme to wear sunscreen, a hat, jeans, and a long-sleeved T to go to the farmer's market, even in the sunniest conditions. Am I some sort of UVA/UVB fearing freak?  No, I'm suffering from phototoxicity. Shout it from the rooftops.  I suppose I couldn't expect the lyme disease to have no impact on my life. It seems that the disease itself spared me from its more serious repercussions but my antibiotics are not so kind. I'm not usually one to feel side effects. I wasn't blessed with big boobs and crystal clear skin while on the pill, nor did I ever contract TSS from a tampon (despite my trip to the emergency room). But those little yellow labels on my doxycycline tablets? They're no joke.  --Take this medication with plenty of water. --If this drug upsets your stomach, take with crackers, bread, or a small meal. --Take this drug 2hrs before or after antacids, iron, vit/minerals. --Avoid prolonged exposure to direct and/or artificial sunlight. --Do not use if pregnant, suspect you are pregnant, or are breast feeding.  As for the first, fine. The second I took seriously after suffering from nausea early in my treatment. The third is harder than it seems. I have to take my morning pill with food (please see #2) but this food can't have iron. This means I can't eat my Special K with red berries that I finally allowed myself to splurge on. Why not? It's iron-fortified.  I didn't take the fourth warning all that seriously and Erik even tried to convince me that it was the pills themselves that were supposed to avoid sunlight, not me. Is it the pills that should eat crackers too? I asked.  So on Thursday we went to the beach. I wore sunscreen and a beach hat. Yet after two hours I was feeling strange. All shivery and hot and my lips were burning/numb/stinging. My hands felt like someone was flicking cold water on hot a pan. The symptoms abated once home but my body was on fire. The next day I played it safe and sat in the shade during a picnic. I walked onto the beach for a minute and felt the same sensations.  This is phototoxicity. I am more prone to extreme sunburns and bizarre burning sensations. This is fairly dangerous and can cause permanent skin damage. So although summer has finally come to Malmö, it might as well be snowing for the enjoyment I can take in beachy activities.  And the fifth warning? At least there's one I can ignore.    	  		 		   		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink But they're so pretty!
