          This is the new film from Michael Moore, who did "Bowling for Columbine." It came out on Friday, June 25, and it is probably the best film I've seen all year. In it, Michael questions the abilities of our president to do his job, and suggests that Dubya has Iraqi and Sudan business interests ahead of his duties to this country. It also showcases everything that is wrong with this "war" in Iraq and critcizes Bush on his actions, post-9/11. Michael paints a very convincing picture of our moronic president and I'm going to see this movie again.

       The Beginning...   Today is July 5th, 2004, and I have just created my very own "blog." I once had a forum, but we had very few people and I ended up being one of the only people posting, so that kind of blew. Here's the address...    http://www.myphpbb.co.uk/timlittle1/ I didn't start it, I was just the head administrator -with the most posts. I don't know how this will work out, but I suppose it never hurts to try, right?

          I recently spent 4 days (July 23-27) in New Orleans with my girlfriend and my cousin, Derek. I must tell you, it was probably one of the best times of my entire life. I fell in love with that city, and for a couple days after coming back I was seriously having withdrawals about being away from it. It's magnificent. There is so much to do, and so much that I wasn't able to do. A plan is already in the works for a bunch of us to go back for Mardi Gras. New Orleans has got to be the greatest city in America, as far as I'm concerned, anyway. And the locals are great -- except for one lady who was running an expensive mask store, but she can bite me. You can seriously wander around the French Quarter for a full day and not do everything it has to offer, which is surprising because it's only 7 blocks long and 4 blocks wide...Anyway, I'm looking forward to going back and I'm getting nostalgic just thinking about it. Sad, huh? Not really if you've ever been.

          ......Weird. That's the only word that can describe this movie. Well, I take that back -- "Weird and Thought-provoking" are the perfect words to describe this movie. I loved it, and having never seen that original, I have nothing to compare it to. Those critics who have blown this film to hell can all kiss my ass because this movie was phenomenal -- so long as you understand it. It cartainly put a few ideas and questions into my head. Whether or not it was a good idea to release it 95 days before perhaps the most crucial election in the last 50 years, I couldn't tell you. I can, however, tell you that from what I gathered, this was a blatant rip at democrats. Now, they never officially came out and said what party the "potential" president and veep belonged  to, but from the the stances on some of the issues they held, I came to believe that they were democratic candidates. I could be wrong, however. Anyway, that doesn't take away from how stunning this movie is. Denzel is great, as always, and this is probably his best film since "Training Day." See it if you haven't already.
