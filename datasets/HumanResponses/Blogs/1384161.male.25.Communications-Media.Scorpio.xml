      Finally after over a year of planning, I've now got my FX rack all set up and working! Since leaving indie-rock band Ripcord in 2001 where I had an 18 unit FX unit I've felt very lost whenever I've done any sound engineering, so with the help and support of my lovely wife (thanks ANG!!) I've invested in a 10 unit rack which has almost as much processing power as my original Ripcord rack. For those of you that are interested I have:   FX =  TC M300  Compressors  =  Behringer Composer Pro MDX2600 XL & MDX4600 XL  Gates =  Behringer Multigate XR4400  EQ =  Behringer Ultracurve 8024  and also a Sony MiniDisc Recorder, and Marantz CD Player!  Yipee!

      Can you believe it?! I went for my second bike ride lastnight, this time with Angela, and guess what?  She got a puncture!!! Oh well. I had to cycle home, jump in the car, and cycle back again. It was a great bike ride though - we started in Cherry Hinton and cycled cross country to Frog End (?!) and back via the Wilbrahams. Great fun! Who knows where we'll end up this bank holiday weekend!

      Its a bit hot here today. Nearly 25C and its not even May yet. Just been to the pub in Ely next to the river! NICE! OH, and the funny thing is, Angela has the day off today, and you'd think that she would be sunning herself in the garden, but NO, she is shopping in Cambridge!! What a waste of time!

      This weekend Ang & I bought ourselves some  lovely new mountain bikes ! Instead of taking a holiday abroad this year we are planning on visiting family in the NW of England and cycling around the Peak District & The Lakes! I went out for a bike ride yesterday, along a local roman road full of lots of lovely bumps and mounds - it was great fun. Only problem was that I got a puncture - DOH!  and had to carry the bike home. Not a great start to my summer of biking - but it was fun anyway.

      There is something wrong with this country when we spend £3bn extra on the military this year to help with the war in Iraq, and then only spend £240m on humanitarian aid in the country.... its a bit lop sided to me.

       The definition of Tidying Up   Angela decided yesterday that we should tidy the house up. I was ushered into my "office" where I proceeded to tidy up scattered CDs, papers and cables leaving Angela to tidy up the main bedroom. Twenty minutes later I was still tidying the office when Angela declared that she had finished!! Sure enough, on entering the bedroom, it was spotless - not a pair of boxers in sight! Excellent! I continued to tidy the office for a few more minutes - and that was that. A succesful evening of tidying...... or so I thought.  Searching for my shoes this morning was a bit more taxing than normal. Usually they would be where I'd taken them off the night before - normally somewhere in the middle of the room - but this time they were nowhere to be seen - oh dear. Using my man brain I searched high and low all across the house just hoping for a glimpse of them. But no - still nowhere. Finally, I thought about looking under the bed where Angela would normally move them (not quite sure why I thought of this last, but hey, I am a bloke) and guess what.... it was an absolute TIP! Clothes and who knows what else stuffed everywhere. I did eventually find my shoes in amongst the mess and scuttled off to work but it started me thinking about "tidying up".   On the surface the room was nice and tidy - but as soon as I dug a little deeper, it turned into a gaping whole of utter mess. Had the room really been tidied? Depends on your definition. According to Ang - Yes. But I'm sure if I was to leave dirty pots hidden under the sink in the kitchen I would hear about it.

      On the way into work this morning I heard news about  celebrations on the streets of Baghdad  which brought a big smile to my face. Although I'm still not sure how I feel about the war in Iraq, the final outcome is definately something to celebrate. Freedom from an oppresive regime can only be good, and its great to see people celebrating there freedom - its just a shame that so many people have had to die in the process. I just hope that today's celebrations continue, and this war is brought to a quick conclusion with minimal blood shed. Then we move to the next stage of how to rebuild Iraq - and who is in charge - who knows what is going to happen there! There is a really mixed message coming out of Washington, the UN and London about who will be in charge - so we'll just have to wait and see.

      Poor little me has not been feeling very well since the weekend. For some reason I've nearly always got a headache and feel really lathargic and tired all the time. Not sure what it is. Maybe i need glasses?! Wouldn't that be strange. We get free eye tests where I work, but I can't really bring myself to go and get one in case they turn around and tell me I need glasses!! Scary thought :-(

      We've had a really busy weekend this bank holiday. On Friday we helped out with the youth Tex Mex Cafe at church were I was DJ & sound engineer. It was a great time and we even got Ang doing some Karaoke!! I was also able to use my new FX rack - so Yipee!  Saturday morning we got up bright and started the long drive up to Angela's parents not far from Preston. The traffic wasn't too bad and we stopped off for a spot of hastily prepared Kentucky Fried Chicken at a service station on the M62. The drive over the M62 was beautiful as ever and we arrived safely in Kirkham.    Saturday afternoon was spent with Angela's parents and also a quick visit to her brother who has just had a new baby boy, TOM. In the evening we watched the UK get a total of NO POINTS in the Eurovision song contest. What fun!     Sunday morning we zoomed up the motorway to Lancaster and went to St. Thomas' - the church were Ang & I got married. It was great to see all our old friends still there!! We had lunch at the local pub, visited Sarah's new appartment & went up to the Ashton where we had views of the Lakes & Morecambe Bay. In the evening we travelled down the M61 towards Manchester and caught the end of the church service at my home church St. James & Emmanuel. Again, it was good to catch up with friends & family.  Monday we spent the morning with my parents and went for a walk in Fletcher Moss Park. After lunch we drove down the M6 to visit Elli & James near Crewe, and then headed home.     A very busy but enjoyable weekend!    UPDATE 29-05-2003:   I have just loaded some more  urlLink pictures  onto the Al & Ang website of this weekend.

      Today's MSN Name:  SPAM   As yesterday was the first International SPAM day I thought it would be right for me to acknowledge this! According to Yahoo - this week marks the point where there will be more emails sent as SPAM than normal emails!! DOH! Thats not good is it? I'm lucky at the moment in that the email addresses that I use don't get spammed at all, but my old email address was horendous - horrible even!   Just on a side note, for those of you interested in the original SPAM -  urlLink here is a link to the official spam website!

      Lastnight I got home from work to find that Buzz (my pet dwarf hamster) had picked up all its bedding and moved it to another part of his cage. Admittadly I hadn't cleaned his cage out for about 4 weeks, but it looked clean enough to me - obviously not for Buzz. Poor little guy - it had obviosly got too much for him and just couldn't wait any longer. Anyway, you'll be glad to know that I have now cleaned his cage out and he is pack in his house again.

For those of you that don't know, I have a dwarf hamster of my own, but nothing compares to this little "PEEWEE"!      "The tiny creature - called Peewee - is fully grown and yet measures less than one inch in length, weighs less than one ounce and is no higher than a 50p piece."   How cool is he!

      Well, Ang is still ill, and still keeping me up at night! The poor girl :-(   For the last few days she has had a really high fever, and goes from being really hot to really cold. I thought I'd look into what a fever is, and learnt a new thing today!   Al's Newly Learnt Thing:    If they are shaking and feel cold, cover them up until the shakes stop, then promptly remove the blankets. Do not use hot water bottles or electric blankets. Shaking is the body's way of cooling down when it is very hot.   You learn something new every day hey?! Oh well - I guess I am going to be ill next. Need to take huge amounts of vitamin-C!!  Get well soon Ang!

      Poor Ang is ill today. She not feeling very well. I think she might have the flooow or something. She has a fever, a headache, and a craving for Ferrero Rocher - poor ickle Ang.   Its actually the first time that she has been properly ill since we got married - but I think she is doing OK - and I'm coping!! Its quite easy at the moment, she just lies there asleep on the bed, and every now and again she will cry out for some water, or another chocolate!! Anyway, I hope she feels better soon.

      Well - I think things have calmed down enough so that I can write stuff again here! Life has been very busy at work because at the beginging of August I was moved into another department, given a little promotion and asked to manage people!! Basically, as well as working within Controlled Circulation I am also now working in Paid Subscriptions to magazines.   Things had just about settled down until this week when we were given a new head of division for the company. In the space of a few days I had a new boss and things were being restructured again!! A little bit unsettling, but I think the changes are definitely for the good. The new head has some really good ideas, and comes with bags of experience so its exciting times for us.  Other news - in the middle of October Ang and I had a holiday in Wales. It was a lovely time to get away from things and spend time together. To see pictures of our climb of Devil's Kitchen, and the lovely sunsets click  urlLink here .     Thats all for now. More news soon!

      This weekend we travelled up the foggy A1(M) to go to a wedding near Stockton-on-Tees. We stopped off at Big Dave's house in Harrogate for the Friday night where we ate a chineses stir fry, watched series 8 of Friends and froze in the house. Saturday morning we got up and went a house that Dave is renovating and hopeing to sell in the next year - the house was in a complete mess but we could see the changes that they had made already, and the enormous potential of the property.  Saturday afternoon we travelled to the venue for the wedding of friends Luke & Faye near Stockton. The service went really well, and afterwards there was an amazing sunset. Luke wanted to make the most of the sunset so drove his 4x4 old skool Land Rover into a position where he and his brand new wife could climb up on top of it and pose for the cameras! Have a look at the picture below, or click  urlLink here  for loads of them!!     The reception took place in a museum not far from the wedding service. The food was great - but the hall was a little cold! We left about 9pm and made the long journey down the A1 back to Cambridge. When we left it was below freezing & foggy, but when we got to Cambridge after midnight it was 7 degrees and raining!!

      Well, I'm the grand old age of 25 today and too be honest, feel different! I suppose its because I am half way to 50, or looking at it another way, a quarter of a century old!!! Poor me. I know its not old, but its still strange.  Ang & I are going out for a meal tonight, and then moving onto a pub where we'll be meeting friends. Should be good. Some people can't make it tonight, so we might go for a meal with everyone else next weekend.

      Apparently the sun had just poooped, and let rip with a huge flare - the most powerful flare ever recorded! Click  urlLink here  to see the article, but here is a summary:   "Tuesday's flare went off the scale; researchers say it was "well above X20". A precise description is difficult because some monitoring satellites were briefly blinded the scale of the event.   Even so, experts say the Tuesday event must have been the most powerful ever recorded, surpassing the X20 flares of 2 April 2001 and 16 August 1989."

      Well here is my first attempt at a "Wee Mee". Its a new thing that MSN has set up for people to use on their MSN Messenger. They tried to make me pay after I designed it - so I did a sneaky Print-Screen!!! Naughty me. Unfortunately the moon is coming out of my head, so I will had to design it again!! OH well. At least its a good first try! If you want to design your own Wee Mee, then click  urlLink here .

       UPDATED 03/01/2004:   Now got more pictures on the main site... click  urlLink here  to see them.   Well, its the day after Boxing Day, and we're now at my parents house in Manchester after spending the Christmas week with Angela's parent's in Kirkham, Preston.       Above  is a picture of me with Angela's family (excluding her brother).    We arrived in Kirkham on  Saturday the 20th , after driving through torrential rain and no visibility fog to get there. When we arrived, Andrew, Angela's brother, and his family were visiting - so we got to see our two little nephews!  On the  Sunday  we made the short journey up the M6 to Lancaster were we attended the morning service at our old church, St. Thomas'. It was great to catch up with old friends, although most of them either weren't there, or have moved on to pastures new! We had a nice pub lunch in Lancaster, did a bit of shopping (but didn't buy anything), and then went to see Angela's sister sing at the Cathedral's Carols by Candelight.   The 21st of December is the day we got together, 5 years ago - 1998!!       Above  - in the afternoon, we went up to the Ashton for the view across Lancaster.    Monday  saw us enjoying a pub lunch with Angela's parents, and then off to Preston where we watched the new Lord of the Rings film - The Return of the King. It was a great film, though seemed to drag at the end - especially once the battle had ended. Numb bumbs all round!  On  Christmas Eve , we travelled down to Manchester to spend some time with my parents and grandparents. It felt like Christmas had come early because we all opened presents for each other! How cool!? It was good to catch up with the family and enjoy a nice meal with them. In the evening we went around to Andrew's house and got to know our little nephew's a bit better - Jacob & Tom - who were intent on causing havoc!! Especially with the Christmas tree decorations.  Ang opened her rather groovy picture on  Christmas Day  and since then I've been in the good books! She bought me a  urlLink wireless xbox controller , a  urlLink 6-in-1 memory card reader , a  urlLink USB pen drive  and a cool book called by Bill Bryson called  urlLink A Brief History of Nearly Everything . We also got a groovy game from my sister called  urlLink Cranium  - which is well worth playing! Apparently its the Game of the Year!      Ang with her new painting!   In the evening we travelled south to Southport were we spent a very relaxing evening with Angela's sister, Helen. We even managed to watch World Idol - an international competition show casing 12 winners of Pop Idol from around the world!! How exciting!!  On  Boxing Day  leaving Helen about mid-day we visited my parents again in Manchester and are still staying with them now!!   urlLink Click here to see some more Christmas 2003 pics from the main site.

      Last night we went to the Green Man pub in Trumpington to celebrate the birthday of Ang, Chris & Mirriam. It was a great evening, and the food was fantastic. Again, I will put all of the photos up on my main site, and post a link here after the weekend. But there are a few sneak previews below:     The food was amazing! I had grilled chicken in a cream wed wine sauce with roast potatoes!! Yummy. Most people had steak - yummy too. There were some who had a starter, main course & even a huge dessert! Too much good food!      The girls laughing at something funny.      Lots of presents were exchanged. Chris received a air hockey game (lucky boy), and Ang got a salad bowl (above).  I will post more pictures on my main website this weekend.

      Today I is called  Snough  (pronounced " snow "), and no prizes for guessing why!! Last night it snowed, and this morning the world was white! Driving to work was fun, but not too bad - the sun was out and it was very pretty!      The roads were a bit slippy, but we all plodded a long at 20mph, so it wasn't too bad!      As the day went on, the weather started to get worse, and by lunch time it had started to snow a bit again. Luckily, we were told that we could leave work at 3pm so we could get home before it was dark, and before the snow turned to ice. Bang on 3pm, a blizzard started!! I'd never seen anything like it! You couldn't see more than 30m along the road... very scary! The roads weren't too bad until I got to Cambridge, where everyone had decided to leave and got home at the same time. It took me 20 mins to move 200 metres and was very frustrating because I was only 1 minute away from home!     Barry opening the door on a blizzard!   Finally I got home after traveling for nearly 3x as long as normal. Who knows what the weather will be like tomorrow!

      As some of you might know, the NASA research vehicle "Spirit" which is currently on Mars has suddenly just stopped working with no explanation. Scientist have just released  the final picture that was sent from Spirit before it went off line may give clues to why it is not working. The picture below clearly shows a McDonald's "M" and proves that there really is life on Mars, and that they enjoy a good McBurger, and probably don't want to be discovered, and so kidnapped Spirit. This also suggests that the Martians are using the McDonald's branding to take over the world.... If you think about it, this explains a bit about all those funny McDonald's characters.     Having done a little googling, I have discovered that Grimace, the McDonald's character, has actually been proven to have Martian DNA!! Ooooh, the things you find out from Google - its so exciting!     A pic of the McMartian.

      Oh dear. A walking magazine recently published  a "How to Get Off Ben Nevis in Zero Visiblity" article which, if it had been followed to the letter, would have sent the walker tumbling off the top of a cliff. The article which was published in Britain's best selling walking magazine, Trail, was written correctly, but it looks like something went wrong in " production ". A good excuse if you ask me! Wish I could use that one. Click  urlLink here  for some more info.       Ben Nevis  - not a place you want to go jumping off a cliff.

Anyway, today's name is  HENRY  - with a salute at the mini-David that was born a few days ago (and has nothing to do with the Arsenal striker - honest!!)

            A Pur-Joe 406 has been clocked at over 406mph (coincidence?) in Cheshire!! Breaking the land speed record for a petrol powered car!! The car, which should have a top speed of 130mph was photographed by a "safety" camera and the driver is now being prosecuted by the police!! The world is going MAD! Needless to say, he wasn't actually driving at 406mph - and probably wasn't speeding either.  Some more details on this bizare story click  urlLink here .

      A couple of weekends ago I was a best man (one of 3) for one of my mates from uni. I was responsible for organising the stag night, and shouting at people during the photographs. Unfortunately the stag night was the night before the wedding, so we couldn't do too much - but we still managed to inflict a decent amount of pain and humiliation on poor old Rob! Some pics are below, but also on  urlLink this page  on my main website.      Let the festivities commence!!        Poor ickle Rob.        Although it looks like he is in pain - he's actually really enjoying it!        We conquered!

      I came out my door this morning, looked into the garden and thought.... "What are you?!". There was this mini looking hummingbird, about twice the size of a bubble bee, hovering and sucking nectar from the flowers in my garden!   What on eaarth was it?! I didn't think we had humming birds in this country, so I quickly drove to work and had a look on the internet - this is what I found.  The little creature I saw was called a Humming Bird Moth, and is actually not that rare in the UK - just hard to spot!       "A rare but increasingly regular immigrant is the Hummingbird Hawk-moth, an impressive insect that extends its long proboscis into a flower as it hovers like a Hummingbird in front of it. At 2.5cm in length, this should not be confused with a much smaller bee-fly or even a real hummingbird! Two interesting residents which may be found close to home are the Currant Clearwing, associated with gardens and allotments where currants or gooseberries are grown, and the Red-belted Clearwing, which emerges from old apple trees."      If you want more info about this humming bird moth in the UK, have a look at this  urlLink BBC website .     If you want some more groovy pics, click  urlLink here .

      It's alleged that one of the French football players has failed a drugs and alcohol test Sunday after the match.  If this is confirmed as positive, under World football Federation rules, paragraph 6 sub section 2e, France will forfeit the first group match 3-0.

      Dear motorist,  In order to assist other motorists in identifying potentially dangerous drivers, it's now compulsory for anyone with a lower than average driving ability to display a warning flag ...  The flag (comprising of a red cross on a white background) will be attached to the top of at least one door of their vehicle.  However for drivers of exceptionally low ability, additional flags are required.  Kind regards ...

      This weekend Ang decided that because the weather was so nice, we should have a garden party after church. Organised at the last minute - we still managed to get a good crowd of people together, and Ang did us proud with the spread of food that she created! It was great to see people in our garden - it was the first time a lot of people had been to our new house!   If you want to see some more photos of our first ever garden party, then click  urlLink here .     People.... in our garden!!!       The yummy food that Ang created.

      Last night Ang and I went to the new cinema in Cherry Hinton (Cambridge) to watch  The Day After Tomorrow . It was a real Hollywood blockbuster type film, with the usual cheezy Americanized plot of doom, and heart warming story of "dad goes on a dangerous mission to save his son, who he never sees coz he is too busy concentrating on his career while realizing that there is more to life than a job". The effects were fantastic, and you could really believe that New York was being flooded by a huge tidal wave! Just watching the film made me feel chilly, as the climate went arctic and the world started to freeze!  BRRR!   On a down side, the quality of the picture in the cinema was awful, with streaks and bubbles everywhere!  GRRRR!  We decided to complain afterwards and managed to get a set of free tickets! Wa hey!! Apparently the intense heat and humidity of the last few days had caused the film to start to disintegrate!!

      Chinese scientists have just released the results of their latest survey into the population of Pandas in China. It shows a 40% increase to 1,600 animals over the last survey. The leading experts suggest that this increase is not down to a recovery in the population, but reflects more on the improved methods into locating pandas.  I think it is because the last time a count was taken, the pandas were having their annual Panda Hide & Seek Championship - there can be no other rational explanation!

      ... for Christmas I would like a new dual processor Power Mac! Hmmm nice. A new power mac has been released that is nothing short of a speed beast! Considering I don't play many games on my PC, something like this would be fantastic for web design and for my (soon to be) studio.     Comparing it against the fastest Intel Extreme and AMD 64-bit processors, these babies are nearly twice as fast when applying a filter in Photoshop! Wow-wee!! The two processors are even water cooled!! If anyone is interested, prices start at $1999 - guess I won't be getting one soon then :( Want to find out more? Click  urlLink here .

      Today, after 2 years of service, our humble little white board has been wiped clean. It will no longer be used to record deadlines for label runs, but instead... well, to be honest, its future is still under review. Who knows what might happen. Its a very sad day.

      This weekend Angela's parents came to visit. Ang was very good at hosting them - and made some wonderful food! Especially her chocolate truffle cake - yummy!! We spent most of the weekend around Ely - checking out the market and craft fairs - even listening to the brass band along the river!!   The below pic shows her parents sat on a bench in our jungle of a garden!

       Running out of things to do in Sydney, I suggested that we visit the Olympic Park where the Olympic games were held at the turn of the century. Ang wasn't too excited about the idea, but reluctantly agreed to follow along fo the day. Catching the ferry upstream to the park gave us great views of Sydney along the way.

       Day 8 we woke up early ready for an Eco-Tour of the Blue Mountains. We crammed into a mini-Bus and headed west out of Sydney for the 2 hour drive, winding up a&nbsp;plateau to the Blue Mountains.     The Blue Mountains are part of what Australians call their Great Dividing Range. A group of mountains which divide the east coast from the rest of Australia. The part that we went to was basically a large plateau with valleys - and reminded me a lot of the grand canyon. The Blue Mountains are considered    blue     because of the sun shining through the oils evaporating off the Eucalyptus trees in the valley below. In the summer it creates a blue haze - though in the winter (when we visited) it was barely visible.      Having arrived at our destination, our tour split into 2 groups. The more energetic group descended into the valley for a 3 hour walk, while our group where to visit a number of lookouts, and do a short walk along the rim of the valley at the top.     The views were absolutely amazing. Our guide was also very helpful, pointing out all the different flora and fauna as we walked along the paths.     There were only 5 of us that stayed at the top. After visiting some of the look outs, and our nature walk we headed towards a Eco-Hotel where we were given a lovely steak & jacket potato meal! The hotel was pretty special too, as it was built with natural materials, and was designed to have minimal impact on the environment.     In the afternoon we picked up the energetic group who had just finished their walk - and drove off to the most famous rock formation in the Blue Mountains... the Three Sisters (below).     We then took an old mining train down into the valley. It was advertised as being the steepest railway in the world, but that didn't really hit home until we started the descent! At the steepest stage it was a 54 degree incline!     At the bottom of the valley we went on a board walk through the jungle - and then headed back up the valley on a giant cable car. Leaving the Blue Mountains behind we then had a quick instruction on how to throw a boomerang, before re-entering the national park at the bottom of the plateau where we were able to get close to live and&nbsp;wild Kangaroos!!    The kangaroos were really exciting - but unfortunately it was somewhat spoilt by the fact that there were more than a few tourists around,&nbsp;sharing the same experience!

       On Day 7 we decided to head to Sydney's most famous beach - BONDI!! The journey was horrible (I hate public buses). To be honest, we weren't that impressed with Bondi - it just seemed so tacky!         &nbsp;  Although the sun was out again, the see breeze was a little bit cold, so we didn't sit on the beach too long, and headed back to Sydney.

       I'm not going to write too much text today - as the pics speak for themselves. Basically we decided to buy a 7-day public transport pass that enabled us to travel on unlimited trains/busses/ferries for the duration of our stay in Sydney.       &nbsp;

       Arriving at Sydney airport at approx 5:30am was a fun experience - it took us a while to pass through customs & immigration, especially as we were half asleep. Leaving the airport by mini-bus we headed to the centre of town to our accommodation - Sydney Central YHA. We were looking forward to falling asleep after a night's traveling on a plane with no leg room - unfortunately we soon discovered that because we had arrived so early, our room wasn't ready!!     We decided that instead of waiting around&nbsp;waiting for a room to become available, we would&nbsp;put our luggage into short-term storage and then go for a walk to the harbour. Navigating using a YHA map, and still half asleep we walked down to the Botanical&nbsp;Gardens watching the sun as it rose over the water! What a beautiful sight.  &nbsp;      It was from the gardens that we also&nbsp;caught our first glimpse of the opera house, and the famous&nbsp;bridge - it was really strange to see something&nbsp;for real&nbsp;that I'd seen so many times before on TV or in a book.  &nbsp;      I don't get to see many sunrises (normally fast asleep), but whenever I do, it is worth the sleep deprivation.  &nbsp;      Walking around the harbour front, through the botanical gardens (the trees in the bottom of&nbsp;the picture above) we&nbsp;walked towards the opera house.       By the time we arrived at the famous building it was 9:30am and we were feeling very sleepy indeed. We decided it would be a good idea to start walking back to&nbsp;the YHA to see if our rooms were ready - and luckily, after waiting only 10 minutes we were able to get into our&nbsp;room on the 6th floor and catch&nbsp;some much needed sleep.   We woke up mid afternoon and then headed down to Darling Habour where we watched the sunset and chilled&nbsp;along the water front eating some yummy Chinese food. We then did a bit of shopping in one of the shopping centres before heading off to the cinema to watch Shrek 2 (which incidentally is a fantastic film).  &nbsp;      Darling Harbour would turn out&nbsp;to be one of our favourite places in Sydney. There were lots of waterfront&nbsp;cafes - and it was just a perfect place to chill.&nbsp;    &nbsp;     As I've mentioned previously, a full description of our day's events and many more photos will be on our main site once I have had a chance to edit them.

      I saw these pics yesterday of the Taiwanese practicing emergency procedures in case of a war with neighbour China. Part of the training was for a French built Mirage fighter plane to land on one of their main highways!! I do feel sorry for the commuters who were diverted elsewhere. Impressive pics though.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Day 4 in Singapore was our last day before we flew off to Sydney. We had to be at the airport to fly out at 7:30pm, so almost had a full day of sightseeing to fit in!  &nbsp;  We decided that the place to go was down to the sea front - hopefully to catch a glimpse of the skyline and to walk around the parks. We caught a taxi to the world famous Raffles hotel where we were greeted by a funny looking Indian guy in old colonial British army dress. Very cool.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;     &nbsp;  We then headed down to the waterfront to the new Esplanade and performing arts centre. We were just about to go for a walk when we were approached by a local who proceeded to tell us about the delights of going for a river cruise! We just couldn't refuse. We quickly bought our tickets, and then next thing we knew we were heading across the harbour towards the MERLION!

      Sunday morning we woke up a bit later, after a busy day before, and decided that we were going to sample the shopping delights of Singapore. After a breakfast of Macky-Ds, we started to head down the main shopping street towards the hundreds of shopping malls.  &nbsp;  If you have never been to Singapore - it certainly is an experience - there are a couple of streets which are just packed full of multi-storey shopping centres - Ang was in heaven! We walked around the&nbsp;shops for most of the day, but&nbsp;didn't actually buy too much. I bought a few t-shirts, and to be honest,&nbsp;I can't remember what Ang bought! My mind was on a camera that&nbsp;I was hoping to buy.... long story, but I almost did - all I can say is make&nbsp;sure you know what you are buying before you&nbsp;start&nbsp;negotiating - the UK spec was different from the one I nearly bought!! Needless to say, I didn't buy a camera in the&nbsp;end - but trying to get a refund was a nightmare, even though we hadn't even been given the camera or left the shop.  &nbsp;      After a quick change of clothes and a pizza we caught a taxi to  urlLink Singapore&nbsp;Zoo  where we went on the&nbsp; urlLink Night Safari .&nbsp;      &nbsp;  The&nbsp;Night Safari was absolutely fantastic.&nbsp;The idea of the&nbsp;zoo is that most animals sleep during the day, so the best time to see them is at night. We were able to walk around the zoo and see all the animals moving about in the way that they do in the wild.&nbsp;The way they've designed it enables you to feel like you are&nbsp;walking amongst them - there is&nbsp;no concrete wall protecting you, but instead some ditches and electrified wire. The result is an experience like no other - you really do feel like you are walking with the animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  One of my favourites was to walk around a bat enclosure - we were literally inches away from flying foxes - giant bats&nbsp;nearly a foot long in terms of body length. Their wingspan&nbsp;is a huge four feet!  &nbsp;       This picture was taken from the internet.  &nbsp;   We also enjoyed&nbsp;a fishing cat, that spent all the&nbsp;time staring in the water waiting for fish to swim by!! Some of the evening was quite scary as well, because you could really hear all the animals - and it felt like they were right next to you. The lions were roaring, and&nbsp;the wolfs were howling!&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Waking up early (jet lag had kicked in) we decided that we were going to spend the full day at Singapore's most popular tourist spot - the  urlLink Island of Sentosa .   Looking at the map we thought it would be possible to walk to the main shopping area, then take a bus to the cable car that would carry us across to the island. An hour into our little walk, we decided that we were lost and promptly flagged down a taxi for the rest of the journey.   traveling in the cable car was fantastic and gave us a birds eye view of Singapore harbour and Sentosa. Once back on firm land we were part of a tour where we visited a number of the main attractions.   Firstly we went to the butterfly house where we were able to walk around while thousands of butterflies (too be honest they should be called flutterbys) flew around us in kamikaze style!      We then moved on to the underwater world, where we say lots of sea creatures. It was really fantastic - and we saw a huge number of cool fishies as we walked through an underwater glass tube tunnel thing. Ang even petted a sting ray! There were hundreds of Nemos and my favourite, sea horses!     The final part of the tour took us to a really bad cinema/ride experience dating back to the early 90s - what rubbish!!   After a lunch of Lemon Chicken and something beefy, we went to the beach and chilled under a palm tree on the southernly most point of the South East Asian mainland. At 3pm we watched a display from PINK dolphins (!!) before heading back to the beach for a spot of swimming, and again chilling while listening to some live music! Very relaxing.     In the evening we headed over the water fountain area and saw a spectacular fountain, fire, laser and huge video projector display. I thought it was going to be good - but it was absolutely amazing. Basically the moving lasers and a video where projected onto the moving fountains (with accompanying cheezy story and music with loads of cool lighting affects). The picture below really doesn't do the show justice.     Finally in the evening we headed back via cable car to the mainland, and caught a taxi back to our accommodation after a thoroughly enjoyable day!   This is just a short description of the day's events. More details and pictures will provided on my main website shortly. Watch this space.

      Well here we go - each day I will try and upload a few pics of my holiday in Singapore and Australia. It will just be a summary of each day, and hopefully I will have more pics and text on my main www.alandang.com website when I get round to doing it - but until then, this will hopefully give you a taster of whats to come.  Anyway, I took a half day on Thursday June the 24th and struggled to leave work on time so that I had a rush to get ready before the taxi arrived. Ang being Ang had given us 5 hours to get to the Heathrow in time to check in 2 hours before the flight departed!! So, we had plenty of time to get there.  At the airport we'd arranged to meet up with my parents - so it was lovely to see them for an hour before we checked in.     Once checked in, Ang raced to the duty free clothes shops, while I watched England get kicked out of the European Cup on limited number of tellys. Finally at 9:45 we took off on British Airways and started our 13 hour non-stop trip to Singapore...     Having arrived in Singapore at around 6pm local time, we took a taxi to where we were staying - near the Botanic Gardens - and walked down the road to a shopping mall where we had a fantastic Thai meal. It was one of the best meals we'd ever had!  We then headed back to the place we were staying and had a much needed sleep.

      Helllooooooo!!! The wanderer returns.... Al is back! Where from you might ask? Well, for top-secret security reasons, I was banned from broadcasting this to the world - but I have just been on a 2 and a half week trip to Singapore and Australia!! It was an absolutely fantastic time, and one of the best holidays ever!   Unfortunately, I have left the dear wife at a conference in North Australia - so she won't be back for another week :( Poor me.  Anyway, I have just got back from a brain splitting 39 hours of travel door to door and have had a 2 hour kip. More sleep for later. In the meatime there are chores to do, its time to sort out the garden, shop at tescos, do 3 weeks of washing, and look at the thousands of pictures that I took and get them ready for showing the world.  For now, to wet your appetite - here is a picture of the Sydney opera house in the reflection of a window. Why? Who knows.... More to come soon....

      On Friday evening Ang and I decided to go to the National Trust property Wimpole Hall, just west of Cambridge. We went for a picnic, but also to see how my new camera could cope with some sunshine and sunsets!! I have uploaded a few of the photo highlights below.   Obviously you can't see the detail that an 8MP camera can produce when reduced from 3,264 pixels down to 400 pixels for the web - but it will hopefully give you some idea!  The two pictures below were taken in our front garden just before I left to go Wimpole. The light in the evening was fantastic, and really shows off the colours in the flowers.     One of our garden roses!      One of our garden flowers! (don't have a clue what it is!)    The pictures below are from our trip to Wimpole Hall. I didn't take many pictures of the Hall itself, but mainly the landscape, wildlife, and flowers!      This is one of the lakes at Wimpole Hall, and in the distance is an old chapel.      A sheep.     This picture was taken using the 14x zoom on the camera!! It brings everything closer together. You can even see the geese in the distance.     A leaf.      Some sort of thorny flower.      Groovy orangy-reddy berries.      Flower stick thing.      Ang in the sun.      The ruins of the old chappel.      Sunset over the lake.      Sunset over the trees and hills.      A glowing cloud!

      As you might have guessed, I am getting quite into my photography and really enjoy shooting pictures. Up until now I have been using the  BEST BUDGET BUY OF 2002,  a Cannon A40 to do all my picture taking - but this hasn't given me much flexibility as it was just a "point and shoot". Even so, I think I have still managed to take some good photos with it and have wanted to move onto the next stage.  Coming back from my holiday in Australia, I was especially disappointed at some of the pictures that I took - it really didn't capture clearly some of the great views that we saw. Although the camera seems to excel in sunset photos, it has struggled with pretty much everything else. Because of this, I thought it was about time that I took my hobby to the next stage and purchased a better camera, with a bit more functionality that would produce better quality pictures.      After trawling the web for a couple of weeks, I've decided on a Konica Minolta A2, an 8 megapixel camera with a 7x optical zoom with anti-shake stability. The camera provides almost the same flexibility as an SLR, but without the hassle of carrying around additional lenses. In my opinion the camera also has some fantastic features that are not found on the entry-level SLRs. The toss up was between the best  non-SLR,  or an entry level  SLR  and I think I have definitely made the right choice.  Although I have had the camera for less than 24 hours, already I can see the flexibility that it will provide me. I have only really ventured out into the garden, but some of the pics I've taken have been out of this world. I really don't have to try - and the camera does all the hard work!!          One of our friendly neighborhood hoverflys.    There are so many functions and buttons, it has seemed a bit overwhelming to start with. But I think in time I would not be able to live without them!! The only problem I have is I am at work again today so can't take any photos. Oh to be in the Lake District, or back in Australia!!

        For our final day in Sydney we decided to visit the ZOO!!  But first of all, we had to pack up everything in our room because we were checking out at 10am. Our flight up to Cairns (the next destination) was not until 7pm, so we had pretty much the whole day to spend in Sydney. All week we'd been looking forward to visiting the zoo... so off we went!!

      On the Sunday we decided that we were going to have a chilled day, and unfortunately I wasn't feeling that great.  First off, we went to Sydney's  urlLink Powerhouse Museum  which to be honest wan't that great. It was supposed to be Australia's number 1 museum for science, technology and fashion (!) - but Ang and I soon got bored as we were walking around.  We then headed to Darling Harbour, our favourite place in Sydney, to say a final goodbye and do a little bit of shopping. From the harbour, we took a ferry under the bridge to the CBD, and then a train to the shopping areas. By this time I was feeling a little tired and just wanted to curl up into a ball and fall asleep!  After a short sleep we walked around to the central train station where we cued up for a free bus to Sydney's famous  urlLink Hillsongs Church . The church service was really good and the music was fantastic - with an 11 piece band!  We then headed back to the YHA, for our last evening meal in Sydney.
