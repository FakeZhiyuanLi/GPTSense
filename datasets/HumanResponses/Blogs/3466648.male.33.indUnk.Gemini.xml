      Hi, I watched a great flick last night a animated movie called Wizards. The movie was made by Ralph Bakshi who also made Heavy Metal,American Pop, & Fritz the Cat. What an amazing movie the Earth has been destroyed by terrorists with a nucler blast. Up from the ashes the Earth is reborn with Elves,Wizards,Orges,Goblins & Faires. This story is a battle of two brothers one good (Avatar) one evil (Blackwolf). The animation is beautiful and images of World War 2 are used in the background for an amazing affect during the war scenes. I highly recommend this imaginative thought provoking film. I also continued watching Smallville S2 6 more shows to go and I can't wait to see the season ending episode. My Doctor's Prescriptions for today is a cool program if you want to be able to recieve your Yahoo e-mail through Outlook Express,Outlook,Thunderbird, & other e-mail clients. The program you need is   urlLink YahooPops    enjoy.   Have A Good Nights Sleep!

      Hey everyone well today   urlLink G4Techtv.com    makes its debut. No more Techtv.com everyone who was on the techtv fourm has been transplanted to the G4 fourms.This really angers me since the forum is really poorly run and has no structure. I also had problems getting around on there webpage and the site would not connect to certain links. I hope this does not represent how G4 will be running there product so far I am very unimpressed. Well I continued to watch the rest of Smallville season 2 only 8 more shows to go and  WOW . I can't get over all the twists and turns this show puts its viewers through. Excellent work! I am trying to put up a Free File (a tip of the hat to techtv) of the day which I will be calling my Doctor's Prescriptions for PC users. I started yesterday with Bookmark Bridge. Todays prescription is a pretty cool program. Have you ever been on the net looking for pictures, and when you finally have found what you wanted there just were to many pictures for you to download from a site (who wants to sit there right clicking each pic). Well   urlLink Quadsucker    is the program that will work for you. What it does is the program will prompt you for the web address of the site you want to suck the pictures off of. After you give it the Url the program will do all the work for you. Check it out.   Have A Great Evening!

      Late Afternoon Well things have gotten kind of better but it still has been a rough week, My Fav show Call For Help no longer airs I miss you Leo. I still watch the Screensavers on Techtv soon to be G4TechTv in fact tomorrow. I really hope they keep Patrick Nortan on the show he is right up there up Leo when it comes to teaching you about computers. If you miss Leo like me you can check him out at   urlLink KFI Radio   every Sat. & Sunday, he also has MP3's of past shows on the site. I have currently been watching Smallville Season 2 what a great show I highly recommend it no doubt very addictive. Tonight is Smackdown as always should be a good show, last nights Eddie Guerrero special was awesome if you missed I hope they rerun it. I found a cool file on the net for all you people out there that use multipliable browsers and want to swap bookmarks between them it's called bookmark bridge go to   urlLink Sourceforge   to get it. The Best Part it's Free!   Have A Great Night!

      I just got done watching a great Japanese movie called Samurai Fiction. The movie is directed by Hiroyuki Nakano and was released in 1998. Beautifully shot in black & white the film is a samurai parody smart and engaging and also very heartwarming. I highly recommended the 2 disc Special Edition that was released in the states you can pick it up at   urlLink Poker Industries    for $19.99 very well worth the price. I will be watching more movies and giving you my take on them every week. For now if you want a great change of pace from the same old tried popcorn movies released in the states Smaurai Fiction is well worth checking out.

      Hey guys,  I have a cool new tip for you today. I know there are alot of people out there who get scammed when they recieve a e-mail and click on some link they think it is secure. You know what am talking about you get a e-mail from your bank or paypal,Ebay, or your credit card company. They ask you to click on a link to update your info and it is actually a scam to steal your login information. Well fear not there is a cool tool to stop this. A program called   urlLink Spoofstick   which adds a tool bar to your browser and tells you what site your really on. So if you click on a link that opens your browser Spoofstick will tell you if your really on that site. I want to thank the   urlLink Screensavers   and   urlLink Steve Bass   for this info.

      I can't believe this there were 2 sites running today offering free Gmail accounts. One site had a trick where if you kept refreshing the page and the correct number came up you would win an account. Yet another site had a number guessing game enter the right number between 1-5000 and you would win. I played along for awhile, forget it. I think I still have a sore hand from all that clicking. In the end if you want a Gmail account either wait or use   urlLink Yahoo   . Yahoo started offering 100mb worth of space for all your e-mails as of 06/14/04. So don't play any games or yet worse buy a Gmail account on Ebay. E-mail is E-mail. Speaking of which I told you guys to check out Thunberbird for you e-mail browser well here is a good set peace to go along with Thunderbird. How about   urlLink Mozilla Firefox   (I love these cool names) for a web browser. Firefox simply rules forget Internet Explorer with all it's holes and security problems. Firfox is the way to go with tons of plugins and a built in pop up blocker. Plus it's Free!   Good Day!

      Hey guys,  I know a lot of you have had problems with viruses this past year. It seems to be that most viruses get on peoples computers through e-mails received in Outlook Express. It also hurts when people open up attachments when they don't know what or who sent them. Well I will provide you with a little bit more security why not switch over to using   urlLink Mozilla Thunderbird  . I having been using Thunderbird for 4 months now with no problems. Now am not saying you won't get viruses, it also depends on you to watch out for unknown attachemnts such as .extensions: .exe, .pif, .scr, .bat, .com, .lnk,  .hta, or .shs. Becareful and make sure you have virus protection like   urlLink AVG Anti-Virus   which is free you can't beat that, and keep it up to date. So go out there and download Thunderbird and AVG you can't beat that 1,2 combo!  Good Evening.

      Leo wrote on his   urlLink Blog   today after taking a trip up to Canada. That he has in fact come to terms with G4/Tech TV Canada to host a Call For Help kind of show. Where they will be taking calls. I think this is so cool, but the only problem is what about the US will we get to see this show ? I really don't think so if G4 wanted to have a show like this on US soil they would have done so. For those people who said it was because Leo would not move to LA to film the show. I think there wrong since Leo will have to go Canada now to film this new show. Well all I can say is Good Luck Leo! Tomorrow will be a busy day for me I will be replacing my 40gb hard drive with a 120gb wish me luck.  Todays Doctor's Prescription is    urlLink The Gimp   a great program if you can't afford Photoshop. This program has everything Photoshop has and runs great plus it's free!  Good Day!

      Hello everyone,  I hope you all had a happy memorial day. I got to watch 2 movies Eurotrip and Two of a Kind. Eurotrip was a fun pic if you liked Road Trip don't miss out. There is some gross out humor but not to much, I did see the unrated cut which had more T & A for both sexes, I think you will enjoy. It sure made me laugh. Now Two of a Kind was on the other end of the spectrum. I remember watching this movie as a kid on HBO. It stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton John in a Drama/Fantasy love story. I really thought that I would not like this movie as much as I did when I was younger. Well I think it stands the test of time and has some cool songs by Olivia Newton John. I recommend both of these flicks. I also got around to finishing up Season 2 of Smallville it was pretty good I kind of think the final show was kind of disappointing. Don't get me wrong I still stand by my word this is one of the best shows on Tv today, and I can't wait till season 3 comes out on DVD. Check it out! My Doctor's Prescriptions for today well lets make it a whole of bunch on one site. I really went to this site to try out a new download manager called Fresh Download. Try it out at   urlLink Fresh Devices   plus many others. The best part is no spyware and there free!   Have a good evening.

        I just got done watching       Lost in Time   a great movie out of Hong Kong starring the beautiful Cecilia Cheung &amp; the great Lau Ching Wan. I loved this movie about a woman who has to struggle with the loss of her boyfriend to a tragic bus accident. She tries to make it on her own, but finds out it's not easy in this heart-warming film. Holly has to raise a child and pay the rent and finds out driving a bus she cannot make ends meet. In steps Hale to the rescue. I highly recommend this picture.

      Hey guys,  I caught a couple of movies this weekend. The first was  Cold Mountain  starring Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger, and Jude Law. It was a very intresting movie the struggle of one man to get back to his one true love who he hardly knows. The DVD  is a 2 disc set collection. The picture and sound are amazing on this disc. Cold Moutain is pretty long clocking in at 2 hours and 38mins but it is worth a rent. Very odd at times but worth it.   Next up was a nice supries  The Butterfly Effect  starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. I highly recommend this movie it is Fantastic and a must see! The DVD comes with the Directors Cut which is the feature you must watch first. If you wish you can watch the Theatrical cut after. The disc is beautiful with excellent sound. Don't miss out!

       urlLink    I just finished watching this great flick. I really enjoyed it, at first I just wanted to watch it for Jennifer Garner ( I just love Alias). I thought no way this movie was going to be good, it would be just a cheap rip off of Big starring Tom Hanks. Well was I wrong.   13 going on 30  is a highly enjoyable and funny movie that touches the heart. Do not miss out on this instant classic, and of course you will discover that Jennifer Garner is more than just some Spy she is a huge star on the rise. Thanks for the laughs and tears.
