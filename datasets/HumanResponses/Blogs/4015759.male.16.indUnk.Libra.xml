      Im Sitting here in an Enriching town called Richmond. Everything Is Perfect. Everyone is calm and no one is in a hurry The lights are dimly lit out on the street, revealing the path for strangers The slightest roar of engines are moving out in the distance how serene the sky looks , so beautiful in every way The mysterious Stars shine through like tiny passageways into the deep unknown Everywhere you look, it all has so much to say The Buildings are old and proud with many stories to tell A Slight clamoring of excited footsteps go up and down the elder stairs ...It was a person, an intricatly designed captivating human being such as ourselves I hear the silent humming of fans off in the distance ...helping people to keep cool and help the chill in their spine arise the deep tone is massaging my soul... Every face I see in this lovely town is more beautiful than the last I open my soul for all of them and strech but a smile to help them on their way Some people say there is too much trash in Richmond, but really, if you just look a little closer, youll see that its all there to teach you something... Everything is perfect and so will it be for yet another day...

       Breathing is Vital for us To survive . But way to many people do not breathe in enough air, and they leave too much  'stale air'  in their lungs.   Breathing is essential for life  , so use it to your advantage. When you take a breathe you    fill    your muscles,organs, and brain with  oxygen . This  energizes  them. When you don't take in enough air you yawn. Thus the idea of yawning meaning your  tired , caz your too  tired  to take deep breaths, or do anything that requires you to do a lot of breathing, so your body forces you too. I will list a very important exerercise for breathing that I hope you all will do for yourself.   Do The following exercise in the morning when you wake up and before you go to bed  ...    Breathe in as much as you possibly can, then exhale it all out gently Breathe in again as much as you possibly can, it will probably more than last time,then exhale it all out gently Now you will breathe in as much as you can, and when you think you breathed in it all, hold your breathe for 2 seconds, then inhale the little bit more that you can without exhaling, hold for 2 more seconds, breathe in more. Now pucker your lips like your going to whistle and blow all your air out forcibly yet steadily , taking about 5 to 6 seconds to do it. When you think you breathed out all your air, hold for 2 seconds, then blow any more that you can conjure up. Then take in a nice big breath and your done.   Congratulations   you just rid your body of the   Harmful Carbon Dioxide   that gets stored in your muscles, and you just  energized  them and filled them with new  nurishing Oxygen , you rid your lungs of all the stale air that gets left at the bottom of the lungs from not taking deep breaths and breathing it out.        It will  wake you up  in the    morning , and make you  relaxed  at  night . It will also  relieve   stress , and help to  relieve  headaches, cramps and if you are in pain with anything,  such as if your impaled with something , do this exercise and it will alleviate some of the pain .  Good Luck, and God Breathing my fellow humans...

      To   Get   something, You have to   give   something.   But to give only to get, is not to get what will please you.   you have to give from your   heart   to make it   true.    And have to really want to  help the other person too.   For Only then will you  receive what you&nbsp;need .  and  finally  be pleased..   &nbsp;

        We  Cannot  judge others by...      ...The amount of money they have, for their money is  Not  them.  ...&nbsp;by any material possession that they posess, because their material possession are  Not  them  ...Their clothes, for their clothes are  Not  them  ...Their skin,their hair,or their looks, for even those things are truly  Not  them  ...&nbsp;their past actions, because what they have done in the past is not what they are doing right now  ...Even for the way they are treating you right now , for you should look at them with compassion instead of hate, for what they are feeling is 10x worse than how you are letting them make you feel...        For if A Person is Deserving Enough to Take Another Breath, Surely They are Deserving Enough for Your Help      &nbsp;

      To Get  out  of the Hole your  in , you have to  realize  your In It, for after you do that, do all the plans on how to escape come flooding in. But if you deny your in the hole,  then how will you ever experience all the greater things that being in the hole doesn't let you see or feel or do?

      Its Very important to be able to distinguish between what you WANT and what you NEED....  Sometimes if we go out and get what we Want , we are hurting ourselves. We hurt ourselves because we are giving ourselves things that come from egotistical , selfish and Immediate gratificational(if you will =-)&nbsp;desires.   You may ask.."So What whats wrong with that ?" &nbsp;  You are setting yourself up for your own downfall. You become attached to these things you buy , and you identify with them, thinking they are you, they are a part of you. But they are not, they are only what they are. And only You are You. And even if you say to yourself, "no..I know they aren't me, they are only things" then I ask you, where does this incredible desire to buy this thing or get this thing come from? If you were secluded in a cave for 20 days, and previously you have never seen nor heard of this thing that you currently want, would all of a sudden it pop in your head and make you think you have to have it?  No&nbsp;... &nbsp;that's absurd , but I guarantee that you WOULD be thinking about your needs, such as food and water or maybe companionship   Only get what you Need, and you will be happy. People think sometimes what they think they 'need' is not enough to make them happy, they want more MORE    MORE    ...What they fail to realize is...If they   JUST STOP   buying all these things they want or getting&nbsp;them in any way&nbsp;... Then they will realize so much more about what they really   Do   need to be happy, and they will be able to meet these real needs of theirs, and finally be Happy...  We have to take that chance of resisting&nbsp;the destructive urges that we get...A good way to find out if it is destructive or constructive is to ask yourself this "Will it make me more loving and help me to be more loved?"

        Control   Your Emotions.     Do Not let them Control You.   For the One who lets their emotions control them...   Lets Their Emotions Hurt them.   And The One Who Controls Their Emotions...    Makes them make theirselves even more closer to that Gracious State of Bliss that we All so wish to Attain.

      We   Cannot   Escape the Traps We are IN...  Until we   Realize   we are In Them.  And When You Do reach that Awareness...  You will Break the Chains that you wrapped around yourself    and you will Finally Set yourself Free.    From All Your Illusions.  And All your Delusions That you made your mind Believe.  For Then And Only Then will you  Actually  See.  And  OH  How much more   Angelic and Divine   the World And Your life   Will   Become.  For that is how They Were   Meant    To Be .

      Sometimes We encounter things that we deem 'problems' in our lives. They Can be like Quicksand to Us. If You struggle against it and resist it...  The more you get Surrounded by the problem and the more Fearful and full of Resentment you become. Rather Understand what is going on and Gain the awareness as to how to get out of this 'problem'. If you just Sit there, saying you Cant do it, then&nbsp;You WILL &nbsp;sink slowly but surely to your Demise.  If you Realize what is actually&nbsp;happening and Take A look around Then you can ask for help, and Someone, no matter how unexpected, will always be there, I&nbsp;Promise that. They can&nbsp;send you the rope that can save you...  But its always your choice&nbsp;if you want to pull yourself out.

        ...To Be Happy is...    ...Loving All there is to be Loved...  To be too busy enjoying yourself to even think about Being Happy.   Never desiring Frivolous things like Approval, Fame, Popularity, For&nbsp; they would Interfere with The Abundant State of Grace you&nbsp;are Now&nbsp;In.   It Is Constantly Accepting Yourself .  It Is Getting Shocked when you hear people talking about hate, greed and suffering because these things seem to never enter your mind.

      Name something that happens&nbsp;to you, that&nbsp;you feel causes you emotional pain.  Name what emotion&nbsp;it brews up inside of you.  Identify to whomb this emotion is directed to.  Then pretend someone you love (your mother, a extremely close friend, a lover) caused that same thing to you.  Would you feel the same 'pain' that you feel from the previous cause?  Would you still feel the same destructive&nbsp;feeling toward your loved one just as you did except against the other person?  Then pretend that this thing that 'caused this pain' to you, didnt cause it, but instead did something that was benevolent to you, would you think that thing was awsome, would you then hold the person or things that caused it in&nbsp;joy, rather then previously holding them or it in hate?  I say to you, this is the rollercoaster of life that so many people fall prey to. and&nbsp;IT IS completely unnessisary  wouldnt you want to be&nbsp;happy instead of angry?  wouldnt you want to be worry free than fret over everything thats not happening to you?  wouldnt you want to escape all those thigns that&nbsp;you bind yourself too, so&nbsp;no longer will you be bored, no longer will you drone, and experience the short term high for the long term low...but you will actually LIVE and you will LOVE it, you will do what youve always wanted and actually be ... content With Everything&nbsp; &nbsp;=-)  What i tried to show in the above exercise is that&nbsp;if an emotion can change so rampantly from one&nbsp;opposite extreme to the next all based on outside causes, then indeed you must&nbsp;realize that it is not the outside causes that cause you the pain that you feel, it is&nbsp;the way&nbsp;you act toward it, i give here another example....  A man is at work and he is displeased with his surroundings and is uneasy with himself and thus with life. His work day ends and he&nbsp;walks home through&nbsp;New York City...  Another man has just started walking home after leaving his girlfriends apartment, is very pleased with his life, he has found happiness and gets&nbsp;his needs&nbsp;met through his new girlfriend, he loves his work, and has found his inner self and spirtuality, he knows that nothing can disturb him from his&nbsp;center of happiness. He is walking on the same street&nbsp;towards the other man.  The street is crowded and&nbsp;the men do not notice&nbsp;eachother, so they accidentaly bump into&nbsp;one another...  The&nbsp;Stressed man gets angry and starts to curse at the other person, yelling at him for getting in his way when all he is doing is trying to go on a decent walk&nbsp;back to his house, he calls him&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;names&nbsp;and even pushes him once or twice in the process, all the while making himself even more distrubed and stressed than he was before...  The&nbsp;Centered&nbsp;and&nbsp;Happy man&nbsp;, at the time of the bump, giggled to himself for his carelessness, and expierienced a moment of playfulness for such a quick movement&nbsp;of his body&nbsp;in another direction, He stares at the man yelling at him, and has compassion for him because he&nbsp;knows the man is only hurting himself by doing such silly things, when he gets pushed&nbsp;by the other man he thinks its fun, but he knows that he&nbsp;should get away from the situation before the man hurts&nbsp;his own self even more...  The First man is even more angry at life and blames everything on the second man, he is unrestful and not at peace , Only until he accepts responsibility that he is the cause of his own emotions will he ever begin to be truly happy, because then if he admits his responsibility , he knows he can control them!  The&nbsp;Second man&nbsp;is still in his center,&nbsp;not&nbsp;more sad and not&nbsp;happier, but in a perfect&nbsp;serene, peaceful state of mind, just as before.He enjoyed the new expierience , learned from it more about how to not make himself, and hoped that the first man may learn something that will him help live a more peaceful , Awsome life.  All i wish is that you, whoever you are, it does not matter, be happy, your happiness effects everything, and likewise, your saddness effects everything, but you are the controller of these emotions, and every human being has a crave for happiness, they just search for the wrong things, they look for external things to help them be happy, which in turn makes them even more worse off than before. instead&nbsp;They should&nbsp;look inward and see all the beauty and greatness they already posess inside of themselves. we all deserve to be happy because we are all from the same Source, and surely we are ALL human beings =-) Love, and then you will truly Live   &nbsp;

        We can only love another only as much as&nbsp;we love Ourselves Any quality that you see in another human being,&nbsp;No matter if you&nbsp;dislike or like it, you Contain It Within yourself    ...when you hate someone, you hate yourself in the aspect that you hate them ...when you see someone being patient, waiting, you yourself have the capacity to be that patient too  We All have such a huge capacity for everything and we do not realize It. If Our Eyes all of a sudden opened to who we truly were, we would be overwhelmed with Excitement and Love For Everything and Above all For Ourselves. ...Find out who you are... life is so diverse and so many Qualities and things are attainable for Us Go Get Them! Why do something that makes you unhappy,Change it! Be Happy&nbsp;And Have Fun, there is NO reason not to..&nbsp; The Only thing preventing you from doing it is Yourself. And The Only thing that can make it happen is  Also  Yourself!

       why do the objects of my happiness cease to satisfy me after a few days or weeks?       ...Because you cannot be happy with something, you can only be happy when your happiness has an object , whether a person or a worldly goal, it is in sincere flirtation that always wears off. True happiness has no object. Does sunshine need an object to shine upon in order to be warm?No . Sunshine IS. Happiness IS.

      I just read about something called 'The Uncarved Block'. Its a principle of Zen, it makes ya think. Pretend you have a brick. Now this bricks purpose would be to build things, as that's what it was made for. If this brick had a dent in it, or was carved, then how could it serve its original purpose? It would not be able to stand sturdy because of its dent so it would be cast aside and thrown away. Now apply this principle to yourself, you are only happy when you are in your most original self. If you change yourself all around and not try to be yourself, then you will not do in life what you do best, and what you like... Thus you won't be happy. That's how you can really judge what you do best, if your most happy when you do it always, not just when you get the 'rewards' for it. Thanks Zen Masters!

      Can we really ever say what is complete truth and what is not while we are in Earthly Existance. Think of what you now think is truth for you concerning what is mystical, such as religion, what your concept of God is, ect. Now go back 20 years and compare it to what they thought than. go back further, further, further. It Changes. Different things arise and this 'truth' Changes. And Each Time Period the people thought that their Truth was the Real Truth, that everyone else who opposed it was wrong. This occurs in science too, new things arise, go against the old things, then theres a period of resistance, then a period of semi acceptance, and then full acceptance which develops into a new truth. So I say to you, accept that what you now know to be truth could be very wrong indeed. Im not saying that it is, but that theres always more out there to be discovered. To go against that would be Ignorance. Accept what you call your truth , but be open to change. Accept the change if you experience what it teaches, and let go of what you used to think was true. Its good to be a little skeptical, but if your too skeptical you'll never understand anything new and you won't transcend where you are now and never reach complete happiness, and if your not skeptical enough then you may believe all the God truths and all the Human Lies, in the process casting yourself into deep confusion and regress all your real truths to nothingness. Find the balance, but mainly base everything on your experience of it. If you judge that its wrong before you try to experience it, then you'll never experience it and will not ever indulge in its rich value. Be open, and above all else Stay Loving.

       If You tell them what you don't like and what you don't want, then you'll get those things, and continue to complain about them.    If You tell them what you do want and like, in a positive manner, then you'll get those things instead, and will like them.

      ...I had a strange experience today. I was driving along in a car with my sister and her friend when I looked to my left to see a giant sized beaver...In Close Proximity To Middle Of The Road! We were stopped, waiting at a red light with a median between us and the road on the other side. Both were one way mini Highways (3 lanes) and it was pouring rain out. I was getting worried for the beavers sake and so I pointed the beaver out to them and they started to get freaked out too. We were hoping , obviously, that he would not get hit. Cars were zooming by it, but to my surprise they kept missing him. I kept thinking I have to help him, I cant just sit here , knowing that I can help, and then watch him get hit and die. So despite the caring interjections of my sister and her friend that I would get hit by a car, I opened the door and ran across the street. I was completely aware of the fact that I was ... Indeed ... In the middle of a one way mini-highway. I ran up to the beaver getting pelted by the rain and I started telling it to move out of the way. I then realized at that point that the beaver did not speak English...So I decided I needed a better strategy, the pressure was building and cars were coming, I decided to try and rush up to it, to get it to move back into the words from where it came from. I knew I could not get too close or else it would bite me, and who knows, maybe I would get rabies. Just maybe. Then to my surprise...A car came up from a street that curved onto this highway I was on, and I had to run in front of it and put my hand out like a crazed street crossing guard. Luckily for my oh so precious legs and middle to upper torso the car had stopped. Then I continued my rampage, trying to make this giant beaver (about 4.5 feet long (I know HUGE) and about 1.5 feet high) GET BACK INTO THE GRASS. But No, beaver just would not go back into where it came from, it was frightened and thought I was attacking it, when I was trying to save its life. Then another car came down the mini highway that I was on and I was waving my hands so that the car would stop, it did, sort of diagonal,but it did. And then yet another car came down and stopped. By this time I had a mini-traffic-jam on this mini-highway going, but all in good intention. On the other side of the street my sister and her friend were screaming at me to get me to get back in the car, as I was creating a jam on that side too with them acting as sitting ducks waiting for me. It was at that point that I decided...I HAVE TO STILL HELP THE BEAVER, the weaker an animal is the more it should be helped, likewise with humans. The thought crossed my mind not to intervene with nature, but then I realized, we already are by having this mini highway here, so its a little TOO LATE for that. Might as well make the best of it.  I Then thought of how when you touch the back of a frock, it jumps out of your way...turns out its not like that with a beaver..A HUGEMONGOUS beaver for that matter. I tried lightly nudging the butt-end of the beaver with my foot, which was encased in a SuPeR protective shoe structure similar to that of a K-Mart Sandal...with one strap. Unfortunately my plan failed miserably and It just tried to turn at me at snap at my feet making it go more into the direction I was standing, thus more into the street. So then I decided to use a bit more force as it is better to temporarily accidentally bruise it rather than have it killed. but don't worry I didn't use that much force, but just nudged harder, and it worked, I started to tower over it to tear it of its thought that it was more powerful, and to make it make itself run away. He then took off several feet to the direction of the grass. He would of gone further, but since it was raining and the ground was wet , taking into consideration that he had claws on his feet (because he WAS a beaver) he slipped immensely. Fortunately he slipped just enough to where less of him was exposed to the road, although he was still very susecptable to having himself all over the road if he just made one wrong move. Then I looked up seeing an even larger traffic jam before and decided that if I tried to push him further he would come back out at me. He looked rather safe. And my sister was screaming...Still for me to get in the car, perfectly understandable though under the extreme conditions. I was only Wishing that this animal made it through, and didn't die because of human carelessness right then and there. Later I found out from my sister, as she drove back in that direction, that there was no sight of him or any matter of his on the road. I then took in a deep breath and was relieved...Then of course I Exhaled =-).  This experience got me thinking though. what was I trying to accomplish? I wanted to prevent the beaver from dying by being slaughtered by a car.  We practically infested everything on Earth and expect it is Ours, And we look at People and Animals as objects that just get in our Way, and we think can do what we wish with them! . On that road there was PLENTY of people that could of gotton out to help that beaver, plenty. They all saw me, they all saw me frantically waving my hands in the drenching rain standing by this helpless beaver, doing a weird dance, trying to get him out of the road. But not one person had the simple decency to get out of their car, get wet, and help the beaver. Why? Have we humans,   who are Also Animals Ourselves  , become so immersed in ourselves that we just get what WE WANT while having complete disregard for other life? That's Complete Ignorance. Im sure of it that people were sitting in their cars thinking, "What the hell is that kid doing, get OUTTA THE ROAD!!" "Forget the beaver I got to go Somewhere!"....It saddens me of course to know this. But also to know that it took an experience like that for me to realize how many things that happen that we don't acknowledge. How much we could actually help but ... brush it off, decide not to. Theres Thousands of people and animals that die each day at OUR expense. By simply eating meat, or an animal by product, we are promoting the suffering and killing of Animals. Then when we see something we want in the store, well just buy it. Instead of thinking how many people are dying of starvation each day , well indulge in a nice large meal that uses a lot of resources that could have been used to feed the dying people, and all the while destroying the environment.  Just donate the money instead , maybe you cant actually see what your doing, but your doing a lot, trust me. But still I guarantee when people read this, they are going to rationalize their way out of acknowledging the suffering that goes on, and they are going to say to themselves that they don't contribute to it in any way.  But HEY! NEWSFLASH!!, If your not part of the solution your part of the problem . Then you may say it doesn't effect you, but it does. You'll see. And it will effect you more in a positive, instead of negative, way if you help too. I Guarantee!  Ya, Know some people say You Cant Help Everything! But...what they don't realize is that you  CAN Help Something , and that can change Someone's Life Dramatically,  Making All The Difference, Making It All Worthwhile .

      Too Many People Fight with Wars of Action, Each aspiring the other to be stronger and more hurtful, Cluelessy destroying more in their ravenous path of Destruction, Ego Power, and UnRealized Fear.  At Least take that little step and stop your Wars Of Action, and transform them into Wars Of Words. No one gets physically hurt, no environments suffer from our ridiculous massacres of all that is right.  Then step a little more and decrease your ignorance. Stop thinking you cant do anything and start resolving these silly entourages of unsophisticated wit. Start to realize what awaits you if you open your self weighted eyes. Use loving words instead of despicable words to stop this mess of self adherence to the ego. Change your 'enemies' into things that cannot harm you in any way shape or materialize form with loving words.  Then take that leap of Faith and Destroy the Fear that's causing all this utter nonsensical Carnage at its base. Your Ego. Cancel its negativity and false superiority and become lovingly Humble. For then do you Posses true power, able to make your enemies your friends, able to stop these condensed Selfishly Fearful Wars like its a Child's Game. You will then open yourself too all that is beyond the Vail that we so Unknowingly made, thinking it would make us happier. You will Break down the wall , the barrier, that you built so long ago and clung to for faux Assurance. You will no longer be restricted, you will no longer feel unsafe or uncared for or any other self imposed underanalyzed fallacious illusion. You Will Be Pure. You Will Be Righteousness.  You Will Be Love .

      Us Humans can have many titles. We identify with them, and like the way they feel to have.  To be the Hero, The Champion, The Helper, The Critic, The Religious Person, The Sports Person, The Go-To Guy and so forth.  Sometimes we command respect from people for the title that we hold, and expect people to look at us a certain way. We usually end up in disappointment because of a factor that we expected to happen, went wrong.  We then begin to feel upset . This is because Often times there is one title that we miss out on, and because we miss it we don't ever reach that real tangible happiness.  That Title is Ourselves.   If We all just set aside these titles that we want people to view us as, and   Just Be Ourselves ,  then we wont have to do something that we don't like in order to keep a fake title that isn't even us.    Be Yourself, Even if it may not seem so at times, It's Always the Best thing you can do for Yourself and Everyone Else.

       Why do we seek to Justify an UnJustifable Cause?   Rationalization does not work in the name of God. The Universe cannot be and is not made of rock to rock, Each with the same forcably Human branded imprint sold as its own unique truth. No one would learn anything new, but continue the same damnable reaction in a hopefully intentional way to stop an action that was damnable in the first place. The Ball keeps rolling the same way that it etched its own circular path and UnDoubtably UnKnowingly Follows It. Continiously thinking that it will reach the other side, but in actuality it is only creating its circular path more etched into the Earth. Increasing Its Own Suffering Over Time and Making itself Harder to Escape its petty Reality. It Passes All the beauty by, Rotation by Rotation, in an attempt to reach it with the same way it has always attempted to reach it, but Never Does. We Need to Stop Preceeding ourselves with the slower ways of before, and start exceeding our self created circular paths, creating New Ways that were always Known, but never Thought Of.

      Many times you will here people say "I am depressed." "I am upset" "I hate him" "I hate her" , and if you ask them why they go into such moods, or hate such things they most likely will reply something to this extent...  "Because that's who I am, if you don't like it, DEAL with it."  What they don't understand is that its not who they are. Its a Delusion to themselves. This Delusion is made up from their Conditioning, their Ego, the way they reacted to their Past experiences and the future Hopes they hold. This Delusion makes us think negatives about ourselves, and hold them as part of our real self.   This Delusion that they let themselves be in will never let them experience happiness, enlightenment, true beauty, freedom or liberation.  The only way they can experience those things is if they give up their delusion and  see who they truly are .   "You are that beauty which looks out from those eyes that can't see it's own beauty, that which fearlessly explores, that which powers the restless storm. You are that which knows the hopelessness of trying to reach liberation through the delusions that you say you are - you are that which is not afraid to admit what you are going through. You are that. You are that which is still there when you are free from everything that you think that you are."  -Nothing  If you tell someone all these things that were mentioned here thus far, and then ask them why they still do the things they do, sometimes they will still reply "Because Its Who I Am" completely disregarding the above things that were mentioned. If you still think that you are your delusions of unhappiness after reading this far, re-read again everything up until now, then continue reading on to further the definition.  We all came from God , from The Source, from the Universe ,  whichever you like to call it. And God is Perfect. Thus we ourselves , in our true nature, are      EXTREMELY HAPPY    for we realize who we are, a creation of God, connected with everything ,  and full of   LOVE  .  What im getting at is, since it is our true self that is happy, and anyone that is undergoing any type of suffering (depression, ect) is not truly happy, thus that part of them is not their true self,  AND   they do not have to experience ANY SUFFERING if they do not want to.      if we realize what is said here, and understand it, then we can become aware of our delusions and stop living them out and suffering. We can begin our realizations toward a happy life , one that is  Full Of Completeness , and above all else   Full Of LOVE  .    urlLink

      I once read a metaphor that was concerned all the different types of religions out there...And here it is...as i remember it...   There were 4 blind men. They were all gathered around an Elephant. They were then told by a man that there was an Elephant in front of them, and one at a time they could go up and touch the elephant for only 5 seconds each. The First man goes up and grabs the elephants trunk, then walks back to his spot. The Second man then goes up and grabs the elephants leg, then walks back. The Third goes up and grabs the elephants tail, and after him the Fourth Man went up and grabbed the Elephants Ear. Then they were left alone with themselves, and the man who introduced the elephant had left, taking the elephant with them. The first man said, "So, An Elephant is a hose.". Then the second man interjected, and said "no no, An Elephant is a piece of rope." Now the third man butted in and said "No your both wrong, an Elephant is a tree trunk!" The fourth man, sat with himself for a little bit, then said..."None of you understand, an Elephant is actually a big fan!" These four man argued and argued with each other to no end, each establishing what an elephant was to themselves. Eventually they split off,each frustrated to no end with the last, and went out telling all the other people of the world who had never seen an Elephant before what it Was.   We know, from reading this metaphor, that all the men, seperately, indeed did not know what an elephant was. The only way that they could find that out what it was is if they  combined all the things they perceived, and that would formulate the true elephant for them . (or at least really close to it!) But the men kept arguing, never reaching a resolution, saying everyone else was wrong. This is like all the many religions that exist in our world today.  All religions have a glimpse to what God (meaning Creator) is, and all have at least ONE good insight in them.  Trouble is, most of the other stuff in some religions is just complete bull, just human perceptions as to what God is, and not actually what God is. To reach a fuller, or at least MORE complete understanding we have to combine all our knowledge and be willing to accept that we may be wrong. If everyone accepted that they may be wrong, then everyone opens up to everyone else.  Then people would see all the actual connections between every religion in this world ...We would eventually create a world wide religion, that never stopped changing. All it would have to be based on is experience. It would never stop changing because we would never stop growing then, and expanding, connecting with God, understanding and realizing more each new moment.  Open yourself up, we only condemn that which we do not understand , meaning its out of ignorance that we condemn (or in plainer words, make fun of) something, thus meaning we would be more knowledgeable and happier if we understood it.  So go out (or In) , Understand, and rid Yourself of Ignorance!

       Pretty Much everyone plays a Control Drama. The only people who dont play a Control Drama are the people who konw what their Control Drama used to be. Let me explain. A control drama is something that we develop, as a result of our childhood with our family. We develop one to help, what we think, to protect us, but mainly to get attention from people. Some of us have play only one of the ones im going to talk about, some play 2, or even three. I dont wish to elaborate on that definition further, so ill jump to the 4 main types.      There is the Intimidator, the Interragator, the Poor Me, and the Aloof Drama.      The Intimidator Drama is used to get attention from people by threatening them, and getting them to comply with you.      The Interragator Drama is used to search someone and question them until you find something wrong with them that you use to either put them down, or make yourself feel better, priding yourself about what you deem 'bad' qualities in them, and how you dont have them (or so you think).      The Poor Me Drama is used to get people to feel guilty about what your going through, and it is used to make them feel sorry for what happend to you. That is how a 'Poor Me' person gets people to give them attention.      The Aloof Drama is played out by someone being 'mysterious', they dont respond too well to questioning, and they make people think about what they are thinking about by their strange acting or appearance. That is how people who play that drama get attention from people.      Most of us play these dramas from time to time, sometimes we slip into one for a good long time, sometimes for only a little bit. But we do this because its the only way we know how to get attention from people. Like I typed earlier, we get these from the way our family treated us. Different dramas develop depending on the dramas that our parents play. Ill give some examples.       Parent - Intimidator = coming on strong to the child , providing harm to them.  = Child - Poor Me (as to guilt trip the Intimidator into not wanting to continue hurting them) or , if that doesnt work, then the child will result as an Intimidator as well, using violence to fight violence, getting the focus back on them, and since this becomes the way they learn to get attention, they feel they have to control people this way for the rest of their life.       Parent - Poor Me = making child give them attention as to why everything is bad for them, making them feel guilty  = Child - Aloof as to get the parent wondering about the child instead of about their Poor Me drama, giving the child more Attention, OR the child will get The Interrogator Drama, as to point out with what the Poor Me parent is doing wrong, getting the focus back on the child.       Parent - Aloof = not paying too much attention to the child  = Child - (Aloof wouldnt work because they still wouldnt get attention from their parent, so they would have to result to being an Interragator) = probing and prying their parents until they can get attention and information from them used against them so that they see how much attention they arent giving to their child.       Parent - Interragator = probing child for something to make the child feel guilty with  = Child - (Aloof Drama as to avoid the questioning of the parent and keep the focus of attention upon him or her)      all in all...here it is again, but simply without too much description       Interrogators make people Aloof.     Aloof Dramas make people Interrogators.     Intimidators create Poor Me drama, or if that doesnt work, then another Intimidator.     Poor Me Drama makes people Aloof or Interrogators.       All this to get attention, and all these cause pain and suffering and unhappiness to other people and to ourselves.      We have a tendency to look at these dramas, and say, no thats not me, and thats not me, and thats not me, and we fool ourselves thinking we are free of them. You have to realize which one you are playing out or used to play out, before you can fully trancend it.      When were playing one of these dramas out, at first its all subconsoius, we dont realize what were doing, but now that you have read this, im hoping you can make it consious as to destroy it. We play these dramas because we think that they will help make things better for us, but in turn , it makes things worse, and we keep going back to the same drama because we still think it will help us, not actually realizing what we are doing. You have to break that cycle in order to be happier. And to break that cycle you have to take 10 feet back from yourself, and become aware of who you are, what your doing, what your saying, how your acting toward other people and why. Then do you become consoius of the dramas your playing and how they are destructively effecting you and others, and then you will develop a need and want to change them, so you stop playing them and actually start feeling a long term happiness and freedom.         - I just finished reading about these drams from the Celestine Prophecy today, and I identified the dramas i used to play and now play, and why. I wrote about these dramas for you, because i know as soon as i realized what i was and am doing i got a rush of euphoria, because not only will i catch myself and prevent myself from acting the dramas out from now on, but this will lead to the happiness i described above, and its already starting to take over me =-)  Its a whole new Sense Of Freedom  I wish for you also to expierience the same realization and happiness,  please understand these dramas and end the suffering their causing you!

        A Relationship with ANY fear involved, is not a healthy relationship at all...   ...If you find yourself wanting to say something, or do something, but you are afraid of how the other person is going to react, then something is not right.  Both people should accept what the other person does and says, and embrace it all . For that is one of the major key points in making and keeping a happy relationship.  So if you every find yourself in fear of saying or doing something,    Just say it or do it  ,  its the only way to break the spell, and either go deeper into the relationship, with both people coming to an understanding of how not to make the other feel afraid, or it will end the relationship as it should be when there is fear involved .  Either way growth and happiness can only occur because no longer will you feel trapped and afraid, you'll fell .... Free.  If you are afraid that you will be physically hurt from saying or doing this something, then just get away from the whole situation all together. When you get any oppertunity too, you have to. That's the only way you can open yourself to be happy again, or even just happier than you are now. If you say, "I cant leave situation, Im afraid of what they will do to me or how they will react", then that's another HUGE warning sign, go against it and get the heck outta there. In no way can you really be happy if you have a fear like that. So don't fool yourself, don't give in to your fear,  Face it and it WILL go away.

       Happiest is the one who is content with what they have materially, and  develops themselves on the inside ,   rather than fighting to be 'better' and have more more more, getting pulled into the self destroying manipulative drama of the media . I mean what are we basing our things on anyway? The more things we have the better we are? It makes no sense...We say we get it caz we like it... But the question is, why do we like it? They (The Media) are putting ideas into our heads and they say it is awesome, so we will think it will make us awesome, even if were not conscious of it, there is quite of bit of subconscious 'programming' , I know it sounds funny but its true, that goes on...Ever feel like your in a trance when your watching t.v.? Guess whats happening there? And does the thing that your getting Actually help you, do you NEED it? Food helps, shelter helps, clothes help(but owning too many clothes serve no point) Even things like incense and candles help caz they serve a purpose, but most things really do not help us, but prove to make us unhappy in the end. We just hold onto all our useless things for no apparent reason and become attached to them...If we would only give our money to those who actually NEED it to provide for themselves one of the essential needs of a human being, instead of buying all the crap we buy...The 'sentimental' objects that we hold onto do not have the memories in them, we have the memories, giving away the object does not get rid of the memories or the even that took place. And if you need an object to remind you of a memory, how important is that memory Really to you? All in all ask yourself just one question and do one thing before you buy something...    1 Question) Where do Your Desires For This Object Really come from? Them? or You?           1 Thing) Write the object(s) that you 'want' down on a piece of paper, and stash the paper away somewhere, not to look at it until 2 weeks later. After the two weeks look at that paper and see if you still want that object(s) that you wrote down on it as much as you wanted them before. If the want diminished at all, even a little bit, then that shows that no way at all can that object bring you lasting happiness, so there is no need to buy it. Give your money to a charity, save some lives, and see how that feels instead.

       You Cannot be afraid...   Just because you don't know.   For If You Are...   Surely you will Never Grow.  You Will be stuck in your  Ignorance  for Centuries to come you will be completely  numb   You will wish you would of listened just that one time   That would have made all the difference   But you ignored all the signs   you kept on walkn on nails   you kept on talkn to bail   And you left yourself behind.   But then you were found.   And you rejoiced.   you raised yourself ,  and erected a Grand New Mound   Nobody could knock you down you said...   But In Your  Pride , there was  Fear    and no longer were you Sound.   Someone came..   and you tumbled Down   Knocking yourself out onto the Ground   Nobody Cared,   Not even You   And you admitted you did not know.  Then all of a sudden a rush of  knowledge  started to  flow  and you got all  excited  but in your  excitement  , you made  Fast Choices.   And No one could understand.   You became Smited by your Peers.   And they knew you knew more, so you were Left Out   For now the cycle Reverses...   No Longer is it You...   But they are Ignorant...   Drowning in their own self caused fear.   You Tried to help ,  but was Pushed Away   For they would not except any light in any way.   So you went in the Mountains and Secluded Yourself.   Growing and Growing  ,  too immeasurable to Say.   You helped them from afar, and that was Good Enough.   Now your happy...   And They are on their path.    The Cycle Starts Again...   Transforming all the  Darkness  Into  Light .  And Leaving Even more than Before...    In the Blissful Bath of Full Complete Unhindered Sight .

       "Nothing happens by chance, to say that things happen by chance is to be ignorant of the reality of cause and effect"   -The 14th Dali Lama    Its that  Blindingly   Simple , lets take a  Simple  Example...   A dice roll, some say its by chance on what you roll, and when you go to the casino its based on luck right!?  The dice roll happens because of the original way you held the dice, and the amount of force and pressure you applied to it with your hand (or whatever else you rolled it with ;)) and the direction it rolled, or whatever it bumped into and any other factor that take place. This idea occurred to me the other day, and it is actually quite possible. You could develop a dice roll where you will always roll a 6, or whichever you want to roll, if set up correctly. And Hey ITS NOT CHEATING, its just using your brain. You and the Dice. You could perfect this and constantly win at playing Craps at the casino until your a Millionaire.  Everything in a casino is like this, its all based on what action took place before hand, or prior to the action, that led up to what took place at that moment. You cant deny this. Try it with your own mind. Think of something that you would say is completely random, then battle it with the actions that were needed to make it happen, and you'll see, that it was not by chance what happened.    I ask you to try and disprove this. Write me a comment about something that you feel happened in your life by chance, and not by cause and effect.    What im getting at is the basis of  Karma . It is a  'spiritual law'  if you will,  saying that your actions effect you, and come back to you . The old 'Live by the sword and die by the Sword' saying CoAbUlAtEs with this. Although at first many will say its nonexistent, if they would just look at what it  Actually IS  though then they will see how true it  Actually IS .   Its the same principle of Cause and Effect ...Over a short term, or long term time period of action(s) that you commit result in a certain action(s) taking place.   The principle of Karma goes a little  deeper  though, but I will stay on the surface of it, only scratching it at the moment. What your intent is in doing an action effects the actions it will cause upon you. It may take a while for ones 'actions' to come back to them , or could happen within seconds. It teaches people lessons.  don't hurt him or her or you'll be hurt. Yes Yes Help Him or Her! And look now everyone is helping you!  But this principle cant be used selfishly to bring you things to make you happy, such as, if you wish to get something from someone, you be nice to them and then you use them, guess again pal (or pala), this isn't going to make you  happy . Again its the Intent that counts too.   Some say Intent is Everything in an action, and it may very well be.     When someone understands the law of Karma, they cannot blame anyone or anything that happens to them on anyone or anything else except themselves. And then, only after they   accept   responsibility   for these things that are happening to them, can they realize the action they set in motion that caused this thing or these things to happen to them, ultimately resulting in them changing their ways, thus eventually changing everything that's displeasing them from happening to them. This is Indeed a very helpful tool when understood.  Good Luck and God Karma =-)

       Why are you   Wasting your Energy and Time   trying to Fight Against something that you know to be true ?   Instead, Accept it For what it is, and devote your energy to   a   Constructive   Task ,  like thinking , and just  Congrue !

        Shall I End this  Masquerade of Longing  ?   Shall I Reverse what im doing and  Walk  backwards  on my path ?  Drop all that I have known and learned just to stop this   fighting of the self  I am undergoing? It Seems Easy Enough , and it looks as if I may be  happier ...     But, No I Cannot do it.    What it is thinking are   illusions to reality  , and I will be  remorseful  if I End my          Journey of Awakening  .    I   Know too much to Stop and Reroute  what I am doing.     If I stop, this longing for Bliss that im feeling will increase 100 Fold.   If I continue, this longing for Bliss that im feeling will increase 200 Fold.      For The More I think I know, the more I understand that I don't know. And the More I realize I don't know, the more I have the capacity to learn the Truth that will set me Free.

      You cannot tell someone a truth, and expect them to know and understand it, so that they can help themselves. They have to find out ,experience, realize, and understand it for themselves.    don't waste your time arguing...     ...  Enjoy your time learning!     ...If They don't ask you, and if you don't honestly feel pulled by God, then they are not ready, and anything you say, hoping to help them, will prove ineffective...   As they  split away  from you and your  enlightening thoughts ,   They will forget,   In  shame and unhappiness  shall they roll in again.  Until everything seems seemingly useless...   And The Truths magically pop back in their head...  They  realize it  themselves...   Find their True Self.     And reach that happiness they thought was never possible .

      There was a study that I recently read, and it was about  Smiling . They took patients who were  depressed .  They told the patients to only take the medication when they were feeling down. But before they took the medication to make a smile with their face, and smile as hard and as much as they could for 30 seconds, then they told them to wait a few minutes, and if they still felt as down as before to take the medication, otherwise, don't take it at all.  I know this may seem a bit farfetched ... BuuuuuuTT, the studies showed that when the people would do the  'Extreme Smiling'    They took their medication on an average of about 30% Less than when they weren't doing the Extreme Smiling  ...  So therse your proof right there, smiling does a body good!   I would advise doing 30 seconds of  Extreme Smiling  after arising from your bedtime sleep, and throughout the day if any Tough Feelings arise!  - Good Luck and God Smiling =-) -  X(Signed) Your Friendly Neighborhood Eli -----------------------------------------------------

      Why is it that there is a thing called  isolation Treatment  that people   Fear  . The Rumor is that when you go into it , in prison, you come out more nuts than before.  ...Funny Thing Is...  .....In the East some people  choose  to do it. They  Actually   Choose  to go into such a thing like a cave, that is soundproofed. And these people get fed one meal a day. The practice in Tibet, or as it used to be, is they can go in for one year, and after that year they get let out, and they can  choose  if they want to go back in.  Most of these people choose to go back in for the rest of their life...   I bet your wondering Why would anyone do that!?, As I was the first time I read about this...  .....It Is  NOT  because they became  crazy , or were afraid of re-entering the world, its not anything like that.  It Is a decision made completely out of the opposite of fear . It is made out of an  Awareness , that even though their physical body is isolated in that one area,  their minds are not . Their minds are free to go wherever they choose. And although you may not believe, they learn to have conscious out of body experiences, and they can go  ANYWHERE  they choose. And I mean  Anywhere .  These people   truly do find themselves , and they realize that all they need Is Themselves, and nothing else, to truly help people. They do healings and help so many other people from afar. They are greatly appreciated and held in high reverence by everyone there for what they are doing, and how they are helping them.    ...  These Hermits Become Enlightened and Truly Reunite With God...

        The Body has limits.   The Mind is limitless.   The Bodies Limits stem from the Humanly programmed Mind.   The Minds limitless ability Stems From God.    The Mind has Complete Control over the Body. Develop first A conscious Free Mind. And Your Body will Follow, being as limitless as your Mind. ...Given enough time you would be able to do anything that you can imagine with your body if you believed in it enough.    We Are the Only Ones that Say and Choose if We Can or Cannot Do Something.      If you can imagine it, you can do it.

      The Following is Based on a True Story that I read from a book about A mans experience when he went to the Middle East in search of Answers...  The man, who we will call John, took LSD and everytime he would have a strange experience that he could not explain. He knew it meant something but didn't know what. He came to the conclusion that he would give this drug to people and see if what they experienced was close to what he experienced, and then maybe they could help him understand what it meant... He chose to go to the Middle East to get his help, thinking people were different there. He found many people, told them he had LSD, gave some to them, but found that no one had an experience like his own. He was getting down on himself for not finding an answer...but then before he was about to give up he saw another American, to his surprise, who had only a cloak on and some sandals. John asked the man if he could help him. The man said he could, and all John had to do was follow him. John disbelieved but thought that anything could help now, so he followed this man to a little town that he lived in. When they got there all the people in the town rushed up to this man and put food and water at both their feet. They started rejoicing for the one man's return. John was in Awe after he saw this. He wanted to get to know more about this guy and who he actually was. The other man would not really talk though. All they mostly did together was meditate and when they would go to the town people would ask for help from this man, and he would help them with his enlightening sayings. One day John found himself sitting on a hill with this man and he started to get curious. He was frustrated that he has spent so much time with this guy, but has not gotten an answer about his experience. He started to ask the man "Who are you? How did you get here?" and the other man replied "Let us not talk about the past, for it has already happened and is unimportant now". So then he asked "don't you care what happened to me and why im following you?" The Man replied "It is irrevelant." John was getting frustrated with the man's replies and asked "Well how long are we going to sit here?" and the man replied "let us not talk about the future for then we will worry, let us just sit here, meditate, and rejoice, living in the now" John was perplexed by his words. he knew the man did not care about his past but didn't understand why. He could have been a murderer in his past and this man would not care. then he wondered why he didn't worry about the future, what if something bad happened? what if a pack of coyotes came by? would he be prepared? All these thoughts ran through his head, disturbing his peace of mind. He then glanced at the man, and noticed that he was in a state of complete confidence and bliss, this reassured him. All of a Sudden he realized that everything the man said was completely true, and so he sat there, relaxed, unworried, unfearful. he just had learned how to live in the now, the Present. John decided that he did not need anyone to explain to him about the experience that he had on LSD, because in time he would understand what it meant on his own if he stayed with this man. He decided that he would stay at least until that happened. At that point, he took off his backpack, full of supplies and threw it off in the distance, for he realized he only needed it because he was fearful of the future. He also chucked away his LSD, because he realized that he did not need the LSD to experience what he was not experiencing, and that if he took the drug again it would hinder his ability to keep his new experience keep going. John was immeditatly unburdened from thinking about his belongings and his LSD because they were gone now and it did not bother him. He was already in a better state of peace then before, and a sense of confidence overwhelmed him that he would soon reach is goal.

        Everyone and everything IS connected...   Here are just Three Prime Examples of this, so for those non-believers here you go...   1) Scientific explanation   #1  -Science says that the big bang took place and that started everything. This means that everything, all the matter in space was brought together to ONE tinnnny little ball about 15 to 20 Billion years ago. Everything was in this one TINY little eetsy beetsy ball. The heat and pressure became so immense that everything went KABOOM (note : it may not have been that exact sound, it could have been Waboom, or perhaps Just Boom, whichever you prefer =-)). As it went 'Kaboom' (if you will) Matter and Non-Matter alike went FLYING and ZOOMING across setting itself up for the universe as we know it today. Thus everything as we know it today was made up of everything that was in that TINY little point. We All came from the same Start. We are all connected.   2) Scientific Theory #2  The String Theory... This Theory basically states that everything in the universe is connected by little strings. These Strings are suspended by each other in space. They are so small that even, at the moment, our most advanced microscopes cant detect them. Anyway, when one string is vibrated, it is like a spiders web, it vibrates the next and so on an so forth with the signal of the vibration, over time, getting weaker until it stops. This means that every action, and every thought that comes out of us, vibrates these strings and causes other things to be set in motion.   3) Religious Theory  - We All came from God. We All came from the same creator , and thus we are all apart of Eachother And Our Creator. Simple As That. When A Raindrop hits a puddle, what happens to the raindrops integrity? Is it still its own raindrop, but just dispersed into and throughout the puddle it landed into? The Raindrop has blended in the puddle becoming apart of it. Likewise, the puddle has blended into the raindrop becoming apart of it.  - All in All we humans are all apart of eachother, we are connected with the bold trees, the gentle grass, the amazing animals, EvErYtHiNg. This means that anything that we do, or think, effects everything else, eventually coming back and effecting us again. Its all one big circle and everyone of us are on the ride. Such a Truly Remarkable thing it All Is.    - Even if you do not believe it, it Sill Exists.     ...Difference is If You DO believe, then you get to see and Expierience it.
