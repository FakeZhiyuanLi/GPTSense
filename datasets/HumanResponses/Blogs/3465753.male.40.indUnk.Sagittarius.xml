      Welcome, everyone, to my Web Log for the Olympic Games in Athens. I am one of the Christian ministry team who will staffing the chaplaincy program for the Olympic Games. For the whole month of August I will be in Athens and I hope to regularly post my observations, thoughts and news on this web log.  Please come back when August comes around and I begin posting..

      Hello (finally) from the Olympic Village in Athens. I say finally because I only arrived in Athens late last night. My flight was delayed 3 hours in Bangkok and I arrived in Istanbul at 9.10am on Thursday - 40 minutes after my connecting flight to Athens left Istanbul. As a result, I hade to wait a whole day in Istanbul before catching an evening flight to Athens. 40 hours after my epic journey began, I finally made it the Hellenic Scripture Union where I am staying at 10.30pm on Thursday evening.  I went to the Accreditation centre this morning and, after waiting in line for a considerable period of time, I managed to get accredited and picked up my uniform etc... They obviously do not have very big people here in Athens because they have not really catered for the 'larger figure' in the provision of uniforms. All I can say is that I hope the material stretches in the Athens heat!  I have been escorted around today by the only other international Christian chaplain who is in town so far - David Wells from Canada. He was with me for the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002 as well. We made it to the Games Village this afternoon after an interesting time on the transport system. All volunteers who work in the Village have to go to one train station (Marousi) and then catch a bus to the Village. These buses come only on the half-hour and there are far more volunteers than there are seats on the bus. There is noone organising a queue or anything as civilised as that so there is nearly always a mad rush to get on the bus with the losers having to wait another half-hour. David decided that I was to be the one cutting a swathe through the other volunteers while he followed in my wake. This worked really well - I got on the bus and got a seat - but David's slipstreaming technique left a lot to be desired and he didn't make it. Perhaps they need to provide a few more buses!  The Religious Services Centre in the Olympic Village is a multi-faith operation. Within the centre there are separate rooms for Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu faiths. After the Games, the building will be turned into a warehouse and, despite what they've done to it, it still has that warehouse feel - sterile & unwelcoming; high ceilings and lots of concrete, This makes for serious accoustic problems. The echoing is so bad that it is going to be extremely difficult to run meetings and services in its current form. We hope to improve this by finding carpet for the floor and hanging banners from the walls. However we've got to locate these things first. Anyone got some carpet (about 8m x 25m) that they want to send over to us 'special delivery'. There are also some simple things that we haven't got yet such as an OHP or data projector to use during services. Please pray that we will be able to find these things and transform the meeting room into something that will be welcoming and effective for the formal aspects of our ministry. We are also having to deal with the Olympic Village management people who have no real idea about what chaplaincy is and how it works. Pray that we will  be diplomatic and have unceasing patience as we educate them / break them in.  Please also keep praying for Susie and Sally as they try and cope with a new kitchen being put in over the weekend.  Until next time!

         Hello everyone,       Sorry I haven’t posted for a few days. We had a very hectic Sunday and I took my first day off for 11 days on Monday.       Sunday was our first real day of services – i.e. the first time that athletes were around in the village and coming to our Sunday services. Our main service was at 12noon and we had athletes/officials from   Australia  ,   USA  ,   Nigeria  ,   Mexico  ,   Ghana  ,   Ivory Coast  ,   Canada   and a few other countries that I didn’t catch. We had no musical instruments so all the singing was  a cappella . It was a great sound that made that echoing warehouse really reverberate – especially when we sang some old hymns and the Africans sang the words in their own language to the same tune! We had a great time as we praised God in song and prayer and heard from his word out of Philippians 2:1-4. One of the things that happens in these services that is very different from back home is that we invite the athletes to tell us a bit about themselves and bring greetings in Christ from their country in their own language.      At  4.30pm , we had a smaller group but every bit as lively! I have produced a 10 page song booklet with about 40 songs in it and I’m sure that we would have sung through the whole thing if we didn’t have to get out by  6pm  to make way for the Catholics! The biggest problem was deciding which tune we would use for some of the songs – there seem to be at least 3 tunes going around the world for “My Hope is Built”! At this service, we mainly had athletes from the   USA   and a few from   South Africa  .       More chaplains have arrived now and we have a bit of a United Nations feel on the chaplaincy team now rather than a Commonwealth feel. We have chaplains from   Australia  ,   UK  ,   USA  ,   Mexico  ,   Argentina  ,   Kenya  ,   Germany  ,   New Zealand  ,   Switzerland  ,   Norway   and a few other nations that I’ve probably forgotten. This makes life a lot easier because each of these people has their own contacts within the different nations, people groups and/or language groups. This makes it easier to get the word out about chaplaincy to many more people.               Please keep praying about our ongoing difficulties with the Greek managers of the Religious Services Centre. They are wanting to keep everything under control so much that it is beginning to hinder the chaplaincy. For example, they have said they do not want us to give out bibles to athletes who come asking for them because they have not been given official clearance by ATHOC. Also, one nation’s athlete fell ill while training and ended up in hospital. One of our chaplains received a direct request from that nation’s team management to go and visit him and take him a bible. They questioned first whether he should have been allowed to go and visit him and, secondly, whether he should have left the bible with him! The experience of religion that most Greeks (97%) have is of the Greek Orthodox Church. In this context the role of the priest is to conduct the services and any sort of pastoral contact is taken care of by the immediate family or social group. As a result, they have had very little contact with sports chaplaincy and have no concept of the pastoral care that ministers provide that we take for granted. Unfortunately, they want us to conform to their very narrow view of ministry and get very scared when we do anything else. Pray that we will be considerate of their position and caring towards them but still go about doing our job effectively.    A number of Christian athletes are competing in these Games – for   Australia   and many other countries as well. (For those whose memories go back 4 years to the Sydney Olympics when a young discus thrower called Deborah Lovely stayed with us in Appin and came to church with us – well, she is now here competing in the 75kg women’s weightlifting!) Pray for all these athletes, that they will always remember who gave them the gifts in the first place and that they do their best to use these gifts for God’s honour and glory. Pray for us as we care for and encourage them.    Till I blog again.

         C’mon the Wallabies!! What a great win this afternoon (our time)!     Why am I talking about rugby when I am over at the Olympics? Well, Channel 7 kindly set up a live feed into the village for those of us who are rugby-inclined so we could watch the match. They actually set up 2 large widescreen TVs so the Aussies could watch one and the Kiwis could watch the other. They obviously didn’t want any all-in brawls during the tense parts of the match causing injuries to our athletes!      I decided that, only as part of my chaplaincy duties of course, I had to be there to watch with the Australians - just in case any major counselling needed to be done. However, it was the Kiwis that needed to be counselled at the end of the game and I left that to the kiwi chaplain.      It was interesting to watch Laurie Lawrence in person revving up the Australians and giving it to the Kiwis just the way that he always does at the swimming.     After the game there was an induction ceremony for the synchronised swimmers and shooters where they were given blazer pockets with the Australian crest in a frame and formally inducted as Olympians. This will happen with every different team that is competing for   Australia   at the Olympic Games.     My afternoon has been spent getting services organised for tomorrow – in particular the music. Boy, I come halfway around the world and end up doing the same job that I do back at Wilton & Appin! We still don’t have anyone to play a musical instrument yet so until my guitar arrives in the middle of next week, we will be singing  a capella . We have services at  12 noon  and  4.30pm  tomorrow.         Tomorrow evening, however, we will be going to the final rehearsal for the opening ceremony but, just like in   Sydney   and   Manchester  , we have been sworn to secrecy about what will be in the ceremony. So you’ll just have to wait. Heh, heh, heh...            Bye for now!

         Good evening all from   Athens  .             For the past two days, the strangest of things has happened – especially for a   Sydney   boy like me: It has rained! Two wonderful thunderstorms have hit us each afternoon which has cooled things off wonderfully. 36° C by lunchtime was getting a bit much and a bit monotonous. Each time I have been caught in the dining hall and have had to have a long lunch waiting for it to be over.             After feeling a bit off colour for a few days from a combination of suspect Istanbul water, heat and jet lag – read into that what you will!? – I have recovered pretty much yesterday and today to take an interest in life and food again.             More and more athletes are beginning to arrive, especially the soccer teams and those sports that are at the beginning of the Olympic program. There are only a few chaplains here so far and more are arriving over the next few days. Those of us who are here are beginning the process of going around the different national team offices, making ourselves known to team management and telling them about the different programs and services that we are offering. I am trying to concentrate on the nations from  Oceania  such as   Australia  , NZ and the various   Pacific   Islands  . I have found many of the teams but I haven’t been able to find   New   Zealand   yet. For security reasons, the administration is not printing a map of where each team is situated so you just have to walk around looking for flags or other signs of the presence of different teams. There are boxing kangaroos all over the Australian apartments but I haven’t found any kiwis yet.             We have also begun our daily bible studies at  12 noon  and  4.30pm  which are slowly growing in numbers as we get the word out and more athletes enter the village. I have begun a series on Paul’s letter to the Philippians. What struck me straight away was that Paul calls the Philippians “God’s people who are in union in Christ Jesus”. He is writing to the Christians in  Philippi  but he is also writing to all Christians. Those who believe in the Lord Jesus anywhere and anytime all share a common bond for we all are in union with Christ. God’s Holy Spirit lives in us and is the living link between us. What better place to be reminded of that than at the Olympics where Christians are gathering from all over the globe, from many different nations and languages and giving praise and honour to God together. I don’t know about you, but I think that’s pretty awesome. It gives me a better understanding of the picture John gives us in Revelation 4-5 of what heaven is like now and will be like when Jesus returns.             There have already been a few Christian athletes who have come to us with different problems that we have tried to help them with. I’m sure that you understand that I cannot tell you anything about these sorts of things. I just ask you to be in prayer for these athletes. God knows who they are. Pray that they would know the grace and peace of God in the midst of the difficulties that they are facing, that they would trust wholly in him and that they would be able to bring honour and glory to him in the way that they deal with them.             Please pray also for the chaplains who are arriving over the next few days, that they would find their feet and acclimatise a bit more quickly than me. And keep praying for our families who are missing us back home.             May God bless you all!

      Bureaucracy, bureaucracy, bureaucracy!! Sometimes it just wants to make you cry.  The Christian Chaplaincy Service at the Olympics is just one of 5 faith groups represented at the Religious Services Centre. The others are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism & Buddhism. Overseeing all of this is the Greek Olympic administration – in our case, two delightful ladies: J and C. If you’ve ever seen ‘Yes, Minister’ then you’ll begin to have some understanding of what we are going through but they make Sir Humphrey pale into insignificance. Their administrative area takes up over one-third of the reception area but they have closed themselves off from the entrance so that they can’t be seen by anyone who comes in. When it comes to being sticklers for rules and regulations, they win the first gold medal of the Games. Major angst was had in working out the correct size of the storage cabinets for the different denominations in our meeting room. It took days of negotiation to allow us to bring in a van-load of bibles, song-books and some homely furniture for reception. There is a printer in the admin area that we are allowed to us but when I asked for the printer drivers so I could load them on my computer they refused to give them to me. I wasted some hours tracking them down. We have just tried to put up some signs to make it clear for those who enter reception which direction is the meeting room for each faith. “Oh, no” said C, “we can’t possibly do that. It might mark the walls.” However, despite all of this things are still getting organised and prepared for the first main influx of athletes at the end of the week.  The Village has been open now for a few days and there are now some people staying here – mostly team administration and representatives of the National Olympic Committees (NOCs). There are a few athletes but not many. We conducted our first Sunday services yesterday with only a few attending our noon and 4.30pm protestant prayer, praise and bible study times. They were mostly team officials from some of the African nations. What a wonderful thing to be in a place where God’s people from all over the world come together and can join together in praise to our Father – united not only by the Olympics but, more importantly, by our unity in Christ. To hear people praying to the same God in completely different language and know that they share the same faith is a great thrill. And it’s only going to get better as more people arrive!  Transport around the city has been great fun over the past days. There has only been one bus link between the metro system and the Olympic Village for the volunteers at a station called Marousi. This was very convenient for us because it is only 3 stops from where we are staying. However the buses ran every half hour and there were always too many volunteers that could fit on the bus. This led to some interesting confrontations. However, yesterday, they decided to change the station from which the Olympic Village bus would leave to another one called Doukissis Plakentias. This means that we now have to travel 55 minutes by train to get to the new station! What is really frustrating is that the Olympic Village is only 10 minutes by car from where we are staying but we cannot get near it. Today we heard that if we went to the Olympic Complex station, only 5 stops from where we are staying, we could catch an express bus to DP. So I went to try it out. I spent a whole hour walking around the entire Complex (this is where the stadium, aquatic centre and velodrome are situated) looking for the X20 Express bus stop. I had been told by a helpful volunteer at the station to turn left after leaving the station and I would find the bus stop. I finally found it 200m away from the station TO THE RIGHT! I was then told that the bus doesn’t start until next Monday! Aargh! As a result, it took me over 3 hours to get to the Village this morning. We have been told of another ‘quick’ way home that we are going to try tonight. Lots of prayer is required on this one!  Please be in prayer for those of us who are already here – that we will take all of these ‘teething problems’ with good grace and copious quantities of patience (which I do not always have). Pray also for the majority of chaplains who are preparing to arrive from the end of this week – that God will oversee their preparations and their travelling. Pray for the families that we leave behind that God’s family will look after them with great love and care.  Until I blog again!
