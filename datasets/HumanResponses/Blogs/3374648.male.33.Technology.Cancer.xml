      So it's all gearing up now. In (almost) precisely two weeks, at 11am, it's my wedding!  It seems hard to believe, even this close, that it's actually going to happen.   Everyone's getting excited now - my mother-in-law to be is frantic as she's got nothing to wear, and it's all steaming ahead nicely.  Anyway, I thought I'd post my speech on here. It outlines nicely how I'm feeling about the whole thing, and anyway, the missus won't bother reading it (I hope)!   Opening   Distinguished guests, mother, mother-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, nephews, nieces, cousins, friends old and new, the unwashed, the unemployed and the unemployable  . .  Ladies and gentlemen bearing in mind that public speaking is a waste of valuable  drinking time, the bars open, and a good few of you are well  renowned for liking your pop, I'm sure I will endear myself to you all by keeping  this speech brief.  My wife and I would like to thank you all for being here and sharing in the best day of our lives. To have so many of you here to help us celebrate makes this day even more special – if that were possible. I’ll try and avoid the usual Groom’s Speech clichés – well, Lou told me to avoid the usual Groom’s Speech clichés – but if the odd one slips in, I hope you’ll forgive me!   Gerald and Carol  My thanks go to Gerald and Carol for making this day possible and for being much nicer in-laws than I ever expected to have – or, for that matter, than I really deserve!  The warm and friendly way they’ve treated me has made me feel welcomed into the family, and without their friendship and support, none of us would be here today – and if it wasn’t for Gerald, our bathroom still wouldn’t be tiled!   I have to thank them both for bringing up such a beautiful and intelligent daughter. Louise is a lovely person. She deserves a good husband.   So I thought I’d best marry her before she found one.   My Parents  I would also like to thank my parents, and I’m so pleased that they and my grandmother could be here tonight – if only to verify with their own eyes that I’ve finally done the deed!.   Mum and Dad have always loved and supported me through every stage of my life, particularly through the irresponsible stage that seemed to last well into my twenties, and which Louise may argue hasn’t ended yet.   So thanks Mum and Dad for all your incredible love and support over many years and for instilling in me, whatever it is that convinced Louise that she wanted to marry me. On that score alone, you should be justifiably proud of yourselves, I am certainly proud to have you as my parents.   Best Man  I'd like to thank Mitch for agreeing to be my Best Man.  Admittedly he was drunk when I asked him, but by the next day it was too late to wriggle out of it!  Mitch and I have been friends now for around 8 years, surviving opposing rugby teams, dodging cricket balls and emptying pub barrels. He’s always been there for all his friends, always trustworthy and always first to the bar. He’s also a gifted liar, and I would ask you to bear that in mind when considering anything his speech may allege. I wasn’t even there and the sheep concerned dropped the charges!   Tracey & Stuart   Our thanks also have to go to our good friends Tracey and Stuart – to Tracey for ably taking on the role of matron of honour for us, and to Stuart for kindly agreeing to take the photographs of today. We’re privileged to count them as our friends.   Louise  So I’d like to turn now to the most important guest here – my beautiful new wife.  (to Lou) Louise, even knowing everything about me, having survived my messiness, geekiness and smelly feet you are still willing to marry me.   I was looking  for quotations, something to express how I feel about you, and about today, and I found this one: “The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed..”  Since our first meeting, our first date, you’ve shown me that extraordinary thing called love – and you’ve transformed me by it into the man I am right now, proud and happy to call you my wife. And to finish this bit with another quote, this time from the Hindu marriage service:   "I am the sky, You are the earth. We are sky and earth united.... You are my wife. My feet shall run because of you. My feet shall dance because of you. My heart shall beat because of you. My eyes see because of you. My mind thinks because of you and I shall love because of you."   Jenny and Jason  Finally, as tradition has it I am required to comment on the state of the bridesmaids. I’m also going to break from tradition a bit and include our pageboy as well.  My fantastic stepchildren, Jenny and Jason, have taken time-out from beating each other up to fill these roles today, and I’m sure you’ll join me in congratulating them, as they both look wonderful and have done their jobs brilliantly.  Kids, I love you loads and I’m more proud of you than I could ever say. Ladies and Gentlemen – would you please raise your glasses to the Bridesmaid and Page, Jenny and Jason.    Closing   OK I could go on all afternoon, trotting out the usual tired old jokes and fictitious anecdotes, but instead I'm going to leave that to the best man.   So once again thank you all for coming to share today with us, and I hope you’ll all join us at the Black Bull for an afternoon of alcoholic debauchery! Cheers!.

      Well, I'd finally had enough. 11 months with Carphone Warehouse. 11 months of wrong bills, enormous mistaken direct debits and long arguments to get money back. 11 months of debates with the call centre, mistakenly called customer service.  So I wrote to them today - I'd had enough. And I thought I'd post it here for the fun of it.   It's worth noting for the record that these are my personal opinions based on my own experiences and all that jazz.  2 June 2004  Dear Sir  Reference 6040  Termination of Contract –  Tel No. xxxxx xxxxxx  Further to my lengthy telephone conversation with your Customer Disinterest Desk yesterday evening – a call which I fervently hope will be my last.  As discussed, please accept this letter as confirmation of my wish to terminate my contract with Vodafone, with one month’s notice prior to the anniversary of my contract.  In the eleven months I have been with Vodafone, I have passed through bemusement, disappointment, disbelief and rage at the abysmal degree of so-called ‘service’ I have received, and am finally at the point where I am left doubting my own sanity.  In all the time I have been with you, not once – not once – have I been charged correctly for the service I have used. I have had to call innumerable times in desperate and increasingly vain efforts to get somebody to resolve my issues. Average call times have been 40 minutes, normally including drawn-out verbal exchanges with script-wielding, broken-record morons who simply cannot comprehend the meaning of the phrase ‘customer service’, much less actually implement it.  I am finally left with the unshakeable belief that there is not a single member of staff at Vodafone competent to run a whelk stall, much less administer a mobile phone company.  The final straw for me came this month, when I received my May invoice. Leaving aside the fact that the bill was ten days late – I should, by rights, receive my invoice 14 days prior to the direct debit leaving my account, but as usual was left with just 3 days – I was stunned to note that Vodafone were STILL charging me £15.31 for a text message bundle that I had specifically, REPEATEDLY requested be removed from my package, for the simple fact that I was no longer using the phone.  I rang Customer Disservice, and (as often happens) first spent ten minutes holding for an operator, being assured my call was indeed important – only to be thrown out of the queue and cut off for no apparent reason.  My second attempt was more successful, in that I actually spoke to a member of the human race, one Mxxxx Vxxxxxx. He single-handedly managed to prove every one of the opinions I have built up over the last eleven months, in that he was disinterested, monosyllabic and unable to deviate from his prescribed script in any way, shape or form. I can only suppose that CPW either hire staff with minimal EEG function, or that lobotomies are mandatory as part of the employment contract. I ended up having to hang up on him and call back – again.  Call three led me – after a lengthy debate over whether there were any managers in the office at 6pm – to one Cxxxxxx Txxxx. Speaking to someone vaguely more senior than the protozoa infesting your call centres is, in itself, a feat on a par with the scaling of Everest. I have come to believe, in fact, that your ‘managers’ are purely mythical creatures, akin to Bigfoot, The Yeti or an honest Labour MP. This is  based on the number of completely fictitious callbacks I am supposed to have had in the last eleven months.  I was impressed with Ms Txxxx initially because it only took her some 15 minutes to comprehend that she had an unhappy customer in her headset. This is an improvement of approximately 100% on every other call centre ‘employee’ I have encountered. It then only took a further 25 minutes of debate and hold time for her to (finally) agree the following proposal;  1.	I will pay the purely fictitious invoice for £33.48 that is masquerading as my bill for May 2004. 2.	This will leave Vodafone in debt to me to the tune of £15.31. This will be applied as a credit on my June invoice, against my line rental – effectively ensuring a £Zero bill. 3.	The June invoice is my FINAL invoice. Therefore, service to 07xxx xxxxxx will be terminated in accordance with this letter.  So yet again, in order to get back money Vodafone/CPW have taken without my agreement or consent, I have had to spend MY time and money on calls, and fight my way through staff who seem to have lost most of their higher brain function.  This is not the first occasion I have had to jump through hoops to get action from CPW. I enclose a copy of my letter from earlier this year, when the only recourse left to me was actually to email the office of Charles Dunstone in order to get a resolution after some seven weeks of abject incompetence.  This is unacceptable.  Therefore, I am left absolutely certain that you will fail to acknowledge or receive this letter, despite the numerous methods I have used to send it. I am certain that I will receive a July invoice from yourselves, and that my complaints will be met with a broken record along the lines of ‘you’ve rolled your Contract over now, you have to keep it till July 2005’.  In order to avoid this, I would like somebody competent (unlikely though it is that one will be available) at Carphone Warehouse to take responsibility for terminating my contract and confirming  that this has been carried out. This confirmation is to be in writing within seven days of receipt of this letter.  As discussed with Cxxxxxx last night, I enclose an invoice for my time at my professional rate, plus an additional consideration for the cost of spending 40 minutes on the phone with your ‘staff’. This invoice is also to be settled within seven days of receipt of this letter. If CPW wish to waste my time, they can reimburse me for it.   Please note that I have not submitted an invoice for the years of professional counseling that will no doubt result from the trauma of repeatedly trying to get your call centre staff to understand the most basic concepts. This has been an experience roughly akin to endlessly smashing my head into a brick wall, but infinitely less pleasurable. I remain utterly amazed that they manage to talk and breathe at the same time.  By now, I am sure that you’ve stopped reading – after all, what’s one unhappy customer, you’ve thousands more to torment – but I live in hope that someone in Mr Dunstone’s office will read and understand the depths which CPW’s service has plumbed – and sack every single one of you. You could all be replaced with talking sock puppets and I think your customers would notice a radical improvement.  I am now with a competent provider, and am reveling in the pleasure of dealing with people who listen, understand and actually do as they promise. After 11 months with a company that appears to be staffed by heavily sedated chimpanzees, you can be assured it is a breath of fresh air.  I can only hope that, for the sake of all CPW customers, some freak electrical storm knocks out the phones – and, ideally, the vast majority of your Customer ‘Couldn’t Care Less’ and ‘Accounts’ staff at your call centres. Believe me, it would be merciful in the long run.  Yours faithfully     Ah, I feel better for putting that out.   If the company deign to respond (come on, what are the odds) then I'll post their responses here too.

       As I'm on a roll, I thought I'd put this article on as well. This was published as a Father's Day special on thw website my wife works for -  urlLink Babyworld , which is a fantastic pregnancy and parenting site. And yes, I'm biased....   You can find the original  urlLink here      How to be a Wicked Stepdad     So you’ve met the woman of your dreams.           You love her, she loves you, the sex is fantastic . . .. and you want to spend the rest of your lives together.             Just one problem, then. .    . . you have to meet her children.             You’re going to become a STEPDAD.                        Congratulations, and welcome to my world. You are about to embark on a journey that is every bit as terrifying, exhilarating, emotional, life-affirming and life-changing as becoming a father through the traditional route. Trust me, I know.             I’m a Stepdad to two gorgeous children – there’s my ten-year-old stepdaughter (teenager attitude, 40-year-old’s cynicism), and my six-year-old stepson (a hurricane in football trainers). And I love them. I adore them both just as if they were my own children.             But let’s be honest here – you don’t want me to just wax lyrical about my two. If you’re reading this, then you actually want to know what it  means  to be a Stepdad. What will you lose? What will you gain? And, most important of all – where do sex and beer fit into the whole thing?             The fact is, there are loads of myths around about being a Stepdad. And while there are loads of books which purport to teach you how to become a father, few if any teach you what you need to know when the kids are that bit older.             So what I want to do is talk about a couple of the myths I’ve heard. I can’t claim to offer the magic bullet that will turn your Stepdad-ship into The Partridge Family. But I know a few things I could have done differently, and maybe they’re things to look out for.             You have so much to look forward to. You will feel close with them. They will come to you for affection. And I promise you – when they first introduce you to their friends as their Stepdad, you’ll burst with pride.             Being a Stepdad is easy               A (former) friend originally made this particular comment to me. His view was that I had ‘taken the easy way out by getting an instant family instead of doing it properly’. Hmm. Complete. Pillock.           Let’s get one thing straight right from the start. What a Stepdad undertakes is not easy. In fact, it’s bloody hard. While I wouldn’t for a moment belittle how hard it is to be a father from birth, people often assume that it’s somehow a doddle to be a Stepdad ‘as the children are older’.             I personally challenge anyone to have a first meeting with a truculent ten-year-old, who’s grumpy because she wants to be out with her friends, doesn’t want to meet you because she doesn’t know why Mummy needs  another  new boyfriend, and isn’t afraid to answer back. . oops. Sorry. Rant over, but you get the general idea.              It will take time for the kids to accept the idea that you’re going to be around for them. They’ve probably already seen someone they love go away. They will expect you to do the same. But give them time, be consistent and reliable, and they will get to trust you. And believe me, once they do, you and they will bond just as tightly as if you were there at the birth.             The point I’m trying to make here is that you’re not just proving to your new partner that you’re reliable. You have to prove it to the kids as well. Their trust is as important as hers. Don’t forget it.             So it’s not easy. Sometimes – and I can guarantee this – you will wonder why you ever gave up your own home and lifestyle for the living hell you’re experiencing. Steel yourself for the inevitable scream of ‘You’re not my dad!’, which will come at some undetermined future point. Because it’s worth it.             Every downside to being a Stepdad – every time you feel mean or nasty, or they tell you that their father lets them watch that Cert. 15 movie you won’t let them see, every time they divide and conquer and turn you and your partner against each other – they’re all outweighed by the good times.                  Fathers make it difficult.                 I believe this one is a myth purely because of our own male insecurities, guys. I know we don’t admit to having any – but hey, you’re reading a parenting website, what does that tell us?             Personally, I think it’s good if the children are still in contact with their natural father. My two see their father every other weekend, and both my wife and I encourage them to do so. The kids look forward to it, and so does he.             But fellas, you don’t have to try and be better than their father. You don’t need to try and beat him at (parenting/driving/Christmas/football/sex/insert pointless pissing contest here). Look at the facts. You’re with her. He isn’t. That’s all you need to know. It’s good for a brief mental ‘nyaah nyaah’ – but leave it at that.             Bear in mind you’re bound to get a bit of the green-eyed monster when he comes to pick them up, and they go leaping up to him screaming for cuddles and kisses. It’s only normal to feel a twinge!             But there are a couple of things it’s worth bearing in mind, guys. First – the kids probably see you every day. They don’t see their father that often. There’s a degree of excitement and anticipation to consider when you see it happen. Second – and I’ll probably be flamed to a crisp for this opinion – but do try and remember that children are both perceptive and manipulative. They will pick up on your twinges – and endeavour to play on that to their benefit. Benefit such as McDonalds, extra sweets and guilt toys.             And when you wave them goodbye, try and remember that by the time they come home, they’ll be as pleased to see you as they were to leave with him.             Oh, and there’s one other BIG benefit to the kids visiting their father. Remember beer and sex? Now’s your chance. No teenage babysitter to get home to, worrying if she’s got smashed on your vodka or left dubious stains on the sofa with her lumpish boyfriend. No small child wandering into the bedroom at six in the morning asking for breakfast or help with the Playstation.              For an all-too-brief window of opportunity, you and your partner can play at being single. Don’t waste it.             And bear in mind, guys – if their father wasn’t around, you wouldn’t get that. Ever. So maybe he does have a use.             Being a Family                   One thing I can’t stress enough, gentlemen – your new partner and her children were a family before you came along. The likelihood is that they may have managed for some time without a man in their lives. You coming along does not make an incomplete family whole. Well, not at first, anyway.           In fact, there will be times when you will feel like an intruder, coming in and spoiling something that was running smoothly. That’s natural to feel that way – your partner will have routines established and, whether you like it or not, you do actually stick a fairly hefty spanner in the works.             You’re unlikely to get regular lie-ins (though if you’re as lucky as I am, your partner may let you sleep in for an extra hour on a Saturday morning while she spends time with the kids). You won’t just be able to whisk her out to the pub for a drink, or nip out to watch the latest movie.              There’s dinner to be made – and I can guarantee that it’s going to be made earlier than you’re used to eating. Keeping the house tidy turns into a never-ending exercise like painting the   Forth   Bridge  .    Homework needs to be done, and helped with. If there’s more than one sibling, you’re going to have to act as peacemaker and referee almost constantly.              Try and remember that no matter how much instruction your dad gave you, or how much you think you can do it – your partner has been doing it longer than you. She knows what she’s doing and if you try and get her to change, you’ll just get in her way. Try and change her routines and methods and you will definitely annoy her.              Which may put the kybosh on any activities after the children have been put to bed.                   That would be bad.                    Especially as you’re unlikely to be getting  that  as often as you’d like as well.             So don’t jeopardise it, guys. Be prepared to do the hardest thing you’ve ever done – and change  yourself . Learn to fit in with the routines already established. Be there to help with the chores and homework.              And please, please please please. . . . DON’T assume you can do it better than she can. You can’t. Watch how she does it, try and handle things the same way, and don’t be afraid to ask for advice. You’ll need it – I did, more times than I could count.             Because as I said at the start of this article – it’s worth it. Every change you make, every sacrifice to your old single lifestyle, every time you prove your reliability, every time you finally manage to explain perimeters or areas for the umpteenth time – it’ll all come back to you in spades.             A few weeks ago my stepson went on a football course. There he was, with several older boys, in his oversized tracksuit. . . . and when I collected him he said ‘Hi, Dad’ and gave me a hug and kiss.             When my stepdaughter went away with her school for a few days, she called up and spoke to me – and told me she missed me and loved me.             After lots of false starts, my frequent bad temper and all the mistakes, I’ve learned enough to love my kids – and they love me back.              In the final analysis - that’s what being a Stepdad means.

          This is a copy of another article  I wrote, awaiting (hopefully)  publication  in  the Oxford  Times.            A recent BBC article highlighted the abuse of work computer networks, pointing out that prison sentences may be in the future.         But not just for the offenders – for the senior people in the company as well.         In the most serious cases, some companies have child pornography or other illegal images or material stored on their corporate servers or workstations – material that they know nothing about, but which could land them in court for negligence.         With employees needing access to the internet more and more in their daily work, it can be hard to police the system and ensure that nothing’s there that shouldn’t be. Yet it’s as vital as keeping up-to-date accounts.         Just imagine for a moment that your company was caught. You didn’t know about it, but it’s there anyway. So it makes the papers. Will your clients believe you didn’t know? You’re prosecuted for negligence. Will your prospects think that’s good publicity?        And what if you’re convicted?           Which costs more – policing your network effectively, or the cumulative effects of a prosecution on your company?       The answer is clear.       So let’s look past the gloom and doom, cut through the headlines and talk about what you can do to ensure your network stays clean as a whistle.        Have a      Policy              I know, I know – these days you need to have a policy for everything. But in this case, it’s important to have a strong IT Use policy that your employees understand and adhere to. Let’s be honest – if your staff want to access content that may be inappropriate, the workplace probably isn’t the best place for them to be doing it.       Obviously, you need to get legal advice to ensure what you’re doing is formed and handled the right way, and doesn’t fall foul of regulations on employee rights to privacy.. My disclaimer here –  I am not a lawyer .           Lay down clearly what constitutes acceptable use of the company network and internet connection. How much freedom you grant your staff is up to you – some companies make internet access available only upon the permission of a manager, others allow much greater levels, even including the use of programs like MSN Messenger to their staff. Decide what you feel is acceptable, and set it down clearly.       Make sure your staff understand what is not acceptable, and that clear disciplinary guidelines are established for breaches of policy. Make it clear and easy to understand. Remember, it’s your reputation that will be damaged if that obscene email gets sent, or those illegal files are found on your servers.     Ensure that every member of staff has signed to confirm that they understand and will abide by your policy. I’ve normally had to sign an IT policy at the commencement of any contract, to confirm that I understand that company’s terms of use.     Get Secure,      Keep Secure        If you read and acted on my last article, you should already have a decent degree of security on your office systems. If you didn’t act on it – well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.          Beause I did.         At length.         So you have – hopefully – a nice strong firewall protecting your data. Robust Antivirus protection keeping more of the nasties away.    Your network, and all the machines on it, should all be patched with the latest updates from the manufacturer.          Keep it that way.          Now, let’s look at a bit more of what we can do to prevent abuse of the system – and, ideally, accidents which may result in perceived abuse as well.         First – your internet browser. I bet you’re using Internet Explorer, aren’t you? You are . . . I can tell.        Bad move.       Internet Explorer allows certain code to run in the background, where you don’t see it. This can allow malicious programs to run, installing nasties like premium-rate dialers and so on. And you’ve all seen the myriad pop-up advertisements you can get when you’re surfing the Web.         So the quickest fix is to change the internet browser your staff use. There’s a range of options, but a good, quick, free choice is Mozilla ( urlLink www.mozilla.org ) which is a development of the Netscape Navigator. You can block pop-ups and malicious scripts quickly and easily. That stops your team from suffering all sorts of pop-up problems if they simply mistype a URL.         Secondly, invest in good content filtering. There are a couple of ways to do this – either you can use dedicated software to filter each individual desktop machine, or you can look at configuring your firewall to block certain websites, IP addresses or keywords.         There are pros and cons with both these methods. Individual filtering may be useful if you have different levels of access required. Firewall-level filtering can help if you need to set a consistent standard.                But be aware, however – if you use keyword filtering, you can sometimes block perfectly innocent sites in an attempt to remain clean. For example, a recent US Government keyword-filtering approach blocked (among others) the words ‘breast’, ‘ass’, ‘sex’ and ‘hot’. Logical, until you try accessing any site researching Breast Cancer (like  breast cancer.com) is now blocked. Or the US Emb ass y website.   Sus sex    Police? Blocked. Oh, and don’t bother trying to get to  hot mail.com. Oops.          So talk to your IT company – we can help, of course, I’m not just doing this from my altruistic nature – and get your system protected.        Monitor and      Clean                Once you’ve got all this funky stuff in place, it’s as much use as a chocolate fireguard if you don’t monitor and check your servers and workstations.         Most operating systems have facilities to allow you to search drives and networks for potentially inappropriate material, and there are programs that can do it for you as well.          If something is found, you need to appoint responsible, mature staff to check and view any dubious content, again working within employee privacy rights.          If something is there, it needs to be found, removed, and action taken. Don’t be tempted to leave it and avoid confrontation. GET IT OFF. Then follow your policy.         Remember, negligence just means not doing something you could reasonably have been expected to do. I think it would be foolish to end up in court for inaction.         Don’t you?

      This is a copy of the article I wrote recently, published in the Oxford Times 'In Business' supplement 18 June 2004. Hope it might be useful to someone!       If you want to connect – protect yourself     OK, just a quick test.    Put your hands up if you use a computer for work or at home. Keep them there while I count. . . . .just a minute longer. . . OK, thanks.     Let’s face it. Nearly all of us use PC’s at some point or other during our work or home lives. And nearly all of us are ‘connected’ now. We surf the internet. Send email. Shop online.     Another quick test. Put your hands up if your computer is protected.    Not quite as many of you this time.    In our daily lives, we protect ourselves as best we can from the things we don’t want to happen. We wear seat belts. Lock our doors and windows when we leave home.     But as we saw over the Bank Holiday weekend, when a new computer virus hits, we don’t learn. Unpatched, unprotected networks slow the internet to a crawl. Computers without virus protection spew thousands of copies of the latest worm or virus out to thousands more unprotected users.    The Sasser worm and its variants, spreading across the internet, infected millions of machines across the world. HM Coastguard had problems with their computers. So did Deutsche Post. So did Railcorp in Australia, and banks in Hong Kong.    The cost to businesses – large and small – of a virus infection is vast. Think about it. Your staff can’t work because their computers are down. Your email systems are overloaded with incoming virus-laden mail, and warnings from other companies’ protection systems. Then there’s the cost of an IT consultant to come in, disinfect your systems, and patch them to make sure they don’t fall prey to that virus again.    Then the next worm or virus hits. And the next. And the next. See the pattern?    It’s quick and easy to take precautions that protect your computer and network. It can be cheap, too.     First things first. Patch your system. The likelihood is you’re running a version of Microsoft Windows. It’s easy to make sure you have the latest updates, and it won’t cost you anything to check and do it.    Simply go to http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/ and scan your system. The Microsoft update system will check your software and recommend the updates you need – then helps you download and install them.    If you’re running Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP, you can have the updates installed direct to your computer without having to go to the update site again.    Once you’re updated, you have a degree of protection against security flaws that some viruses – like the Sasser worm – exploit to do their damage.  So what next?    Well now you’ve made sure your system is up to date, you need to put locks on it. That means a firewall.    Put simply, a firewall sits between the data on your computer and the internet, and controls what can get in and out. Just like a doorman at a nightclub, the firewall holds the ‘guest list’ for your machine – and if the name’s not down, they’re not getting in!    A properly configured internet firewall can prevent you getting infected from malicious programs or websites, and keep ‘hackers’ out of your system and away from your personal data.    For home users, a software firewall is usually fine. These programs run in the background on your home PC, protecting it as you surf the Net. A wide range of software firewalls are available, but two of the best are Norton Internet Security 2004 and Zone Alarm Pro.     For the business user, a software firewall isn’t really enough. To keep your network safe from damage, and your data free from prying eyes, you should invest in a hardware firewall – a separate, dedicated machine that sits between your server (or main computer) and your internet connection.    Using a separate machine keeps even professional hackers at an increased distance from your important data. Also, hardware firewalls have a greater depth of security measures and more options, allowing you greater levels of control over what comes in and out of your office.    There are a bewildering array of options and products when it comes to hardware firewalls, from basic ‘SOHO’ units up to high-end products. For the smaller business, the best security and value can be obtained from companies like Watchguard and lower-end Cisco models. At the higher end, systems from Cisco and Microsoft’s Internet Security and Acceleration Server offer power, controllability and security – at a price.    Finally, once you’ve got your computer or network updated and secured, you need to ensure it stays healthy.    This means good, solid Virus protection from a reputable manufacturer – and it needs to be updated at least once a week, if not more often. Those on a broadband internet connection should consider setting their anti-virus to update daily.    For the home user, consider a product such as Norton Anti-Virus 2004 (this is included as a module within the Norton Internet Security package). Business Users can look at the Norton Anti-Virus network and corporate Editions, and products from McAfee, Network Associates and Sophos.    Finally, the last – and arguably most important – part of your new, secure computer environment. . . . .your own common sense.    Don’t trust to chance that everything will be OK. Make sure you update your patches and your virus protection. Don’t open email attachments unless it is from someone you know AND they’ve told you to expect it.    The bottom line is simple. GET SECURE.    After all, you wouldn’t leave your house unlocked when you went to work, would you?

      It's Monday.    I don't think anything more needs to be said, really.    It's Monday.    It's only ten to nine in the morning and I already feel tired.     It's Monday.    More when I can summon up the energy.

      This post is mainly for my wife and children, who I adore more than can be imagined.  So I had to go to the GP today.  I finally had to take some action about something I thought was just part of me, but in fact is a growing and potentially serious problem.  The problem - I have a temper.   It's always been bad, and I always have had a short fuse. That hasn't necessarily been a problem in the past, but these days I find my fuse increasingly short, and the consequent rage brighter and hotter then ever before. It's been getting progressively worse over the last year.  The main consolation I have is that I'm not a physically violent person, and I've never raised a hand to a woman in my life. Nor have I - or would I - ever smack my children.  Not that it's much of a consolation when I'm terrifying my poor new wife and my stepchildren, shouting like an ogre and prowling the rooms of the flat.  As my darling wife puts it, 'when you're good you're very very good, and when you're bad. . .'  This is not something I want to be. And especially with the people I love most in the world.  SO - after a weekend of tears shed on both sides, I realised that I can no longer blame others for my personal failings. It's always been a case of 'you shouldn't say that to me/do that/ignore me/be sarcastic/insert piss-poor abdication of responsibility here', and I've never taken a long, cold, objective look at the face in the mirror and admitted the truth.  I have an anger problem. I am on the dangerous borderline of being an abusive person and I need help to stop.  These were my words on Sunday morning, spoken out of the depths of desperation and fear - and, finally, recognition. No more excuses. No more shifting the blame. It's down to me to seek help and work on fixing the problem.  The result was that first thing this morning I was in front of my doctor, opening myself to her scrutiny and (unspoken) judgement, something I would never have done before.  And the amazing thing - she told me that in my area (Oxfordshire) there are NO Anger Management referrals available through the NHS - they're only handled through Thames Valley Police and the courts.   Meaning that if you recognise you have a problem and ask for help, you won't get it. However, if you punch your wife in the face, then you're entitled to a free course!   Anyway, I don't want to get into a rant about that, as it just shows up the inequities of the current system. And I don't have private health insurance, sadly. So we talked about other options.  Well, the only other option (apart from a two-month waiting list for a referral to the counselling service, which I've also taken) is - you guessed it - Prozac.  I'm now a member of the Prozac Nation.  I thought I would feel scared - I certainly did when I contemplated the possibility of it before going to the surgery this morning. Before today, the idea of regulating my body's chemical generation with something like Prozac would have been anathema - while I do smoke and drink, I've never used controlled - or overtly controlling - substances since a puff of a joint 17 years ago.  But I was surprised to find that now, with the bare choices in front of me, I welcome the chance to perform exactly that regulation. If I'm not capable of controlling or moderating my behaviour through normal methods, then this is my best hope of support as I try and learn to make changes.  And I don't want to risk the most important things in my life - my wife and children.   My wife is an incredible person. She works harder than just about anyone I know, holding down two jobs, working till ten most nights. She is always there for those who need her, whether it's a customer in her day job needing help with their bike, or a member of  urlLink  Babyworld  with a problem.  And she's always been there for me. When things were hard professionally, and I was on the verge of a breakdown, it was Lou who helped me through over a month of depression and physical illness. She helped me through the loss of a close friend through the same professional debacle.  I adore my stepkids - my article for Babyworld, also posted on this blog, outlines just how much I love them.  I will not allow my personal problems and demons to take my family away from me.  So Lou, if you're reading this - I'm sorry for who I become at the wrong time. I am sorry that you seem to have married a Jekyll and Hyde character. But with your love and support, I will make the changes.   I will make the good person I am most of the time the whole of me, and work every day from this moment on to be the man that a good heart like yours deserves.  This wasn't supposed to be a love letter. But I think that if I'm going to write about my problem and my progress, I should recognise and write about the person who also has to face it.   And I love her. With all my heart and soul.  And for her, my children and myself, I will beat the demons.  For Louise xxx

      I'm disappointed.  So I was browsing the Blog of an  urlLink  old friend  I haven't seen for ages and she had a link to yet another Geek Quiz - the  urlLink  the Thudfactor Polygeek quiz .  Did it.  Here's the result.       You are   22%   geek     OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae. God, I hate you.       urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com    Bugger.  Less time on Splinter Cell and talking to the wife required, more time playing UO and reading O'Reilly for me from now on.....

      Don't get me wrong - since being 'outed' by friends some years back, I've never had a problem with accepting myself as a Geek.  I'm happy as a Geek - not in the  urlLink Jargon Dictionary  sense of the word, but in a more generic sense like  urlLink this writer  said.  I love technology. I love gadgets. I've written articles on geeky stuff for a newspaper. Hey, I'm blogging too.  But recently, it's become more than just an interest.  Computers have now become my hobby and primary interest after my wife and family. I find myself spending more and more work time doing technical support and engineering work than my I should given my job title (I'm the Sales Manager for an  urlLink IT company ). And I love it.  My PCs are frequently to be found in pieces being upgraded with this or that whizz-bang hardware, or I'm trying out a new bit of software that might do what I want slightly better or slightly faster. And I love doing that too.  In my spare time, I read - but I can't remember the last time I read fiction. I've just finished  urlLink  Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World  , by Bruce Schneier, and next it's Kevin Mitnick's book, urlLink  Art of Deception  . And I love reading them.  This morning, I ordered a new  urlLink 200GB hard drive  for my primary machine, as I've started a project to turn it into a media server. I've already set up the networking and the AV stuff.  And it got me thinking, until I was left sitting here, coffee by my side, wondering  a la  Sex and the City....   . . . . When does a Geek become a Hacker?     I mean, does anyone really know? Is there a line somewhere, some technical feat that needs to be established before a Geek can rise to the next, exalted level?  Some people seem to imply that a hacker is a coder - the one who isn't satisfied with this module or that program, so writes his own. I've met people like that.  Some people seem to imply that a hacker can also be a hardware modder - but do I need to  urlLink shoehorn a Micro-ATX mainboard into a scale-model aircraft carrier  to qualify, stunning achievement though it is?  I don't write code. I don't see the point in making the exterior and interior of my box look pretty. I want it to work, fast and effficiently.  Then I saw  urlLink this reference  to a Hacker in the  urlLink Jargon Dictionary . And I read it.  Then I read it again.  And again.  It seems to summarise, very nicely, how I feel about myself, what I'm doing and where I'm going.  I've never felt settled and happy in life and work before. Since accepting that I am, in fact, happiest when I'm playing with computers and cool technology (well, not  the  happiest, but certainly the happiest I'm going to discuss with you on here, I've felt more in tune with myself than ever before.  So is that self-acceptance part of the invisible line between Geek and Hacker?  I hope so.  The definitions I've found seem to indicate that it's best when someone else recognises your status for you, too.  So - if there's a Hacker out there who can understand how I feel, and fancies giving me their opinion,  then please comment. Let's find the line. Maybe then one day I can cross it.
