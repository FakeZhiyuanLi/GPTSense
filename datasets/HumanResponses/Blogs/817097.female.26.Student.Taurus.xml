      Well, the day has come, my last day at home.  Tomorrow I'm off to school to begin a new adventure.

           Well, I sort of got wrapped up in stuff that isn't bloggish.  I really should write here more often, it may help my stress level.  Frequently I wonder why I've put myself through this.....why I feel the need to hold a doctrate.  Is it greed?  Insecurity?  A little bit of both?  It's all possible.  I've always been a bit power hungry.      I'm currently wrapped up in a nightmare called research.  They say that without research, society would remain stagnant.  I really don't see a problem with that.....we've got water, power, the internet and cable television.  Maybe society is greedy.  Actually I see the point of research just the project which I'm involved in.  Dreadful.  Fat kids, pedometers.....they just don't mix.  It really isn't earth shattering either.  America's children are obese, so be it.  Perhaps had someone not done research into the taste trends of America, they wouldn't be......see, research really is evil.

      I'm feeling a  bit overwhelmed at the moment.  I leave for Chicago on Wednesday, have a test on Tuesday and 8 more hours of Pilates tomorrow.  If only school were finished.  Only 6 more days of lessons.  SWEET!  Word of the day:  ruka - hand/arm.....how can you have only one word for both of those????? It seems a bit counterintuitive to me...if you say "boli mi ruka" it can mean "my hand hurts" or "my arm hurts".  How do you know????? Oh well....I just need the basics....

      Yet again, I've been extraordinarily neglegent in my blogging.  Such is life.....NEWS FLASH...I started blogging before I started grad school and now I'm almost finished.  Hallelujah!  Thank god.  There isn't enough tequila in the world to get me through another year of this.  I've learned tons of stuff.....now to apply it and hopefully make some money in the process.....  In my free time, I've been studying up on a new language....Croatian (thus explaining the date/time stamps).  My new boyfriend is actually Croatian and his family opts not to use English often in my presence.....therefore, the paranoia in me has driven me to attempt to learn the language....That way they can't talk about me behind my back.  Word of the day:  cherry-cheshnya-spelled w/o all of the cool letters....

      Blah...still feeling a bit overwhelmed.  This blog thing is a bit therapeutic really.  It allows me to sit down, rehash my day and consider life in general.  Tomorrow is my last competancy of graduate school.  Comps are really just exams, but rather than writing answers down on a sheet of paper, you show a prof a skill.  Talk about a stressful situation.  The skill is usually a huge mystery until you draw a card and thus seal your fate.  It's stressful to put it nicely.  Got my feedback from my students.....had one tell me that I should be more approachable.  That's an interesting comment.  I've spent the majority of my adult life striving to be unapproachable.  I think that is the result of growing up an "Air Force brat" - forming connections with another is useless because they usually leave within a year or two.  I suppose I could work on that, but now isn't the time.......  Word of the day:  zavezan - tied up......interesting word choice for today...  Geez....it sounds like I could use a good shot of vodka, some chocolate ice cream and a good therapy session......
