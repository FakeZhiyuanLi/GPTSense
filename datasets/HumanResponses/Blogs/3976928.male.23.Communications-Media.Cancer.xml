      I am but a man who makes mistakes, but don't we all? Each day i live, i make another mistake, some good and some bad. Why didn't i listen to myself, why did i cage the truth; the reality. What is it that can be gentle, kind, caring, a friend, a cuddle, hatred, frustration, aggrivation, lonliness, fullness, emptiness, true and pure...it is love. Do i deserve to be loved? I cannot answer that of what i do not know.

      Life has got me by the throat, i am pulled and torn in everydirection.  I am no longer in my head, my thoughts are scrambled.  Why does life take the directions it does, why do we have to make decsions.  As a child decisions are always made for us, as we grow up we start to make our own decsions but but realize we really don't want to.  As i have said before we chose the path we walk, would it be the same if someone chose it for us? In essence no, because only you can be happy with your choices, and live life the way you are supposed to.  I never thought life was supposed to be this tough....but i guess the fault is nobodies but mine.

      Everyday you wake up and start another day.  You generally go about business in a routine, same thing almost everyday.  Have you ever stopped and looked beyond what you see?  What does this mean you ask? Well wake up stop and think who your smile will affect today, What will you just opening a door mean to somebody?  Saying hello to a perfect stranger how that will make them feel?  But remember there are always bad choices that you make to, how does that affect your routine, the people around you?  People always say to think before you act or say, but in reality that never really occurs. If that were the case you would see less heartbreak, less confusion, less anger, less frustration.  We choose the path we walk on, and pave our destiny, why things happen the way they do is up to you and solely you.  We cannot blame anything or anyone but ourselves, you must live with the decision you make and differenciate beween your fantasy and your reality.

      We all embark upon life fearing death.  Those who don't admit that are lying to themselves.  To truly not fear death you must understand that in life death begins.  It may be a hard concept to grasp and understand, but Love and you know life, lose love and you know death, be haunted with both then know fear.

      Maybe i am miserable...or maybe its just how i am getting sorted in my head...i don't know.      So ok i got offered everything i have ever wanted...maybe i also threw away everything i ever wanted.  I admit that perhaps my choices were not the best, but they were my choices and i am living with them and seeing where it goes.  I am not going to stay as i am if i can't be happy, whats the point in that...you said that you want me to be to be happy...but do i deserve it?  you said everybody deserves to be happy...and i am glad you are happy and excited...perhaps i will be to one day.    I never wanted us to stop talking, and let me guess.." what did i expect " well i don't know...i just didn't think we would leave it like this....i mean say goodbye this way.  I mean if thats what you need and want then so be it i will say good bye right now and well i won't type or talk anymore..i will wish you well, and many happy days ahead of you.  Enjoy your trip, becareful take care of yourself..remember the stop points along the way..take lots of pictures of the mountains..of everything....sing lots of songs..keep a smile on your face...no matter how frustrated you get remember you'll be there in no time....my folks send there best....  I will miss you, and i will never forget....good luck.....i didn't want to say goodbye this way....

      I am not sure what to say anymore.  Its been a while since i have posted, and frankly i have been lost for words.  People are discovering that i am a little under the weather, especially my folks.  There is no fooling my mother she knows everything, and i guess she would know me best.  I am trying to beat this feeling of blah, but hell it isn't going away..and not getting any easier.  I am still losing sleep, but whatever who needs that right?  not me i'm fine!    I feel something is missing, and i can't bring it back....i feel like i am dying inside, like there is a void that cannot be filled. Never thought i would say it but i think i really do need to talk ..i need to be helped thru this time i can't do it by myself.

      I have had a chance to think about a few things...i think that i have made a mistake in judgement.  I thought things were supposed to be this way..and that it would be easy.  Bullshit, its not easy and fuck it if i am happy.  Things seem to have gotten worse..sure i see the change but it was not what i was looking for...or as much as i needed; yet anyway.  I dug my hole, and now i have to lay in it, as hard as that may be.  I have been told how wrong i was but did i listen? nope..i seem to be a fool...and perhaps a fool will be all i ever am...It was pointed out to me again today, that i have a hard time trusting and being secure.  There have been things in my past that have made me insecure and i gave up my chances to throw all my doubt away.  Maybe one day i will get that chance back but only time will tell.   Sometimes you have to be stupid to be smart, and smart to be stupid..i just hope i have enough sense to be either.

      Everyday now i have sat and wondered who i am.  The answer may be right in front of me, yet i cannot comprehend it.  Things are changing to fast, in the present and the near future.  Pretty soon i fear i will be bestowed a great lonliness, and i see there is nothing that i can do to undo this.  My heart understands pain, but why must it hurt all the time, hurt the way it does?  I wish i could find the answers because i don't have them...do you? i ask in knowing i will never recieve a reply...but one day maybe i will be once again fulfilled and truly happy...but maybe that is not a life i am destined to live.  I am now to the point where i feel i must kneel down and give up...but would that make any difference? i sit here now and say probably not.  I hate my job, i hate who i am....but i must live with it...somewhere there are those who truly care, i go on for them....
