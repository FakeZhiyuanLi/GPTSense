      The title is a phrase that the preacher used in services this morning. I just thought that it was very funny outside of the context of the sermon.  I have a couple more rants today. Maybe more than a couple.  RANT 1:  Last night I got home late and I missed most of Inuyasha, and what I did see wasn't good at all. Then I fell asleep before I could watch Cowboy Bebop. But I saw Wolf's Rain, that's for sure.  RANT 2: While out last night, I decided that for my birthday (which is in two months) I want to go to Memphis for the weekend. I didn't know that my mom would insist that we bring my dad and my brother. For those who don't already know this, Tyler (or THE IT as I call him) is the whiniest, most irritating, most retarded, laziest, hungriest creature ever spawned by the devil in the days of man. Going on vacations and car rides with him is like being locked in a small room with someone scraping their nails on a chalkboard with a microphone held up against it for hours on end. And my dad is a vacation Nazi. He never wants to do anything fun, like shop or go through Ripley's Believe it or Not. All he wants to do is tour boring historical monuments and play put-put and ride go-karts (which is stupid, he has a real license and a real truck right there in the parking lot that he does not have to pay $5 for two stinkin' minutes of ride time.) He also makes me share a bed with THE IT and will not even think about my offer to sleep on the floor.  My mom thinks that I'm just being bratty not wanting them to go. Well I WONDER WHY. I want to bring a friend, too, to have someone to hang out with besides my parents or the family pet, but she brought up the "there's-no-where-for-them-to-sleep" thing. WELL THERE WOULD BE IF WE DIDN'T BRING THAT MORONIC LITTLE ZEALOT THAT CALLS ME AN OX!!!!  RANT 3: My dad won't let IT grow its hair out. What would be wrong with that? Its hair looks cute long (about as cute as can be expected of a savage idiot) and its his head. This debate did spawn a funny comment from my mom. "I seem to remember a little teenage boy be-boppin' to my house every evenin' with a MULLET!" Ha ha ha ha, busted!  RANT 4: I have to do my homework.  RANT 5: This song is not downloading quickly enough.  Oh, wait, its done. So I guess my ranting is done too. Maybe tomorrow I'll have something positive to post.  recommended listening: "Halloween" by AFI. I like this song, not only because I love Halloween, but this song is just awesome.

      Last night was fun. K. came over and we went to Sonic. After that we went to the movie rental place (which sucked because they have like NO old/good movies that we could get.) Then we went into the grocery store,which was full of happy grocers getting off work at 10 p.m. They were very talkative and helpful (all of them, since we were the only people left in the store.) Anyway, we ended up gettin applications and filling them out when we got home.  All this job-getting is rooted in the fact that I have found a gorgeous car that I must have. It is a purple Honda with a sunroof and I love it! Best thing is that its practically new, so it would last me all the way through college. But the bad thing is that its 11,000 dollars and that my dad is a tightwad when it comes to people besides himself. In fact, yesterday he made this big spill about it and that very night went out and bought a horse. He has also recently bought a stock trailer and a tractor. Altogether, that stuff (that we don't even need or use) would have made a VERY significant dent in the price of the car.  Aside from that, when we got back from the grocery store, my mom was unloading them and putting them away and she said "Oh, sweetie, I didn't get you Ramen, but I got you some Smack. Its the same thing."  "...."  Anyone who has made any sort of comparison between the two knows that Smack and Ramen are NOT the same. Smack is gross. Its all slimy and does not hold any flavor whatsoever. Disgusting stuff. So it looks like I'll be spending the next week trying to make Smack taste good.  I really like saying "Smack."  Moving on, K. and I also decided that it would be fun to mess with one of our guy friend's mind. I won't get into details but in the end, we're all going to the movies this Friday (supposedly, that is subject to change. I certainly hope we do go. I haven't done anything in forever.) So there is my light at the end of the tunnel. But I have to do my homework first.  Well, I think I'm done ranting for at least a few hours.

       Ahh. The first weekend after the school year begins. Everyone always looks forward to it for the entire week (even though for us it was just two days.) It really is a last-ditch effort to reclaim the total vegetation (aka "bliss") that was summer vacation. I can't make such an effort this year, however. I have homework. No actual "work," but I do still have to read a lot.  Now that I've gotten my classes straightened out (didn't take long, did it?) I can step back and look at my schedule:  AP US History (which now doesn't have any German foreign exchange students, just me and Janeya. My smallest class.)  Human Relations (second smallest class. Three students, all girls.)  Study Hall (haven't been here yet, so I don't know a thing about it. I hope its not like the last Study Hall that I took. The teacher gave us his own assignments. He seemed to think that was what the class was for. That, or that a bunch a delinquints were in there just because no one else wanted them.)  Trig/ PreCal (Math is the devil, but at least the teacher is good.)  LUNCH (which was excellent today. I had a chicken sandwitch. Which is also what I had yesterday, if that tells you anything)  Desktop Publishing (today we made bookmarks. Largest class.)  AP English (not a small class but all girls besides one poor boy. Come to think of it, not such a poor boy, as is v. pretty)  Chemistry (looks to be a lot like Physical science, which was boring. Earth science was also boring. Any science that has more to do with rocks and elements than living things is boring.)  Spanish III (my favorite subject. Ties for smallest class, as is now just me and my friend Christina who is currently nuts over Evanescence and every band that toured with them this summer, as she has just gotten back from their concert where she had front row tickets.)         This year seems to be going along very normally. Last year was Hades.      Junior year is the hardest year, everyone says. Dangit.

      Hello! Welcome to the home of my pointless ramblings!  Well, I suppose I need to get started now.  Today was, as is suggested in the title, the ever-agonizing First Day of my junior year in high school. Here's how it went:  6:00 AM- My mother walks into my room and says (all chipper about it) "Wake up sweetie! It the first day of school! Wake up! You must be so excited! You get to see all your friends again after summer, won't that be fun? And everyone will be so happy to see that you've stayed!" (I'll explain that in a minute.)  I slowly turned my head ( Exorcist- style) and said: "Mom, its not time for me to get up yet. It is six o clock. Katlin will be here at 7:30. I have everything picked out. All I have to do is put on my outfit and do my makeup and then go. I am sleeping until at least six thirty."  After that I couldn't sleep.  7:35 AM- Katlin arrives. Must shield young brother from profane rap CD of Katlin's sister. Must sheild self from Katlin's driving.  7:45 AM- Awkwardly chat with some people I haven't seen in months, therefor we have nothing to talk about.  8:00 AM- Go to class assembly where four adults drill us on the new rules provided by our lovely new principal (not). The rest of the morning is spent in various other classrooms being drilled on the exact same thing PLUS the oft-ridiculous rules of the other classes. I also discover that my first two classes are incredibly small (2-3 people including me) and that two of my friends got married (not to each other: the guy is barely sixteen. He married his 14 year old girlfriend who is pregnant. The girl is seventeen and married a guy she knew for 3 months. Ladies and gentlemen I give you Mt. Vernon.)  10:50 AM- Am drilled along with some other longsuffering Juniors on the new rules by the principal himself for about as long as the other teachers leactures combined. We are late for luch, which makes us late for 5th period. During lunch everyone asked me why I stayed in Mt. Venon. I had applied to go to ASMSA, which is the hardest school in the state. If I had gone I'd have to leave home, which I thought I wanted but turns out scared the living daylights out of me. So I remain where I am. @ The Big Vern. My friend Jaimie (who would have been my roomate) went. Our dorm was purple (my favorite of all colors, darn it all.)  3:10- Four more lectures later and I am free! Aside from being laden with a load of paperwork to fill out. Plus I have to completely reorganized all my school supplies and make a list of new ones that I have to get for my AP classes. Little brother rides bus home so we listen to profane rap songs on the way home. Katlin was running out of gas.  3:20: Home again home again la dee da. Peel jeans off, as they were very uncomfortable after spending the entire summer in gym shorts and tank tops, which I change into. Make self Ramen (one of my favorite foods) since I figure Mom won't feel like cooking.  7:30: Mom does feel like cooking. She makes my other favorite (broccoli and rice) and I eat some even though I'm full from the Ramen and Corn Pops I had already eaten. I still manage to choke down two whole bowls (I'm such a bottomless pit.)  Which brings me to the point where I thought that I should make a blog and that today was an ideal time for it. It may be fun. If I don't update you'll know it wasn't.
