        Hey! Okay, this is like what? My 5th time trying one of these dang things?! I just can't keep up with them! But maybe this summer I can...and maybe this thing will work unlike the other sites. That makes me SO mad when they don't work!     Well, this summer has started with me going to the field for 3 days straight in the damn rain so we could host SeCtIoNaLs!!! Which we didn't win...I was sad, but I really couldn't do anything, but cheer them on. I wish I had a lot of talent. Sad thing is...most people with the talent screw it up...that's just a waste and it pisses me off! Yeah, so then I've been swimming a lot...thanks to the Cooper's! LoL! Laurel has spent the night...and I've worked so far... so yeah! That's how my summer's been so far!    Today Jillian and I went fishing, duck chasing (-not really), FROG catching (-I only caught a baby frog which was as big as my pointer-finger nail! Aw it was cute though! And we saw other ones but they were little booger's and got away!), and what else?! Hum... I caught a Bass...actually I caught 2 of them! One was pregnant so I guess I caught 20 Bass!!! Jillian caught 2 baby Bass's. They were cute too! We also caught a WHOLE BUNCH of Blue Gills. Dumb fish...they go for anything. I throw in my line and they attack it...I mean if the fish only put in some thought...I mean there goes mom...oh look the food's dragging her...oh she's back with a soar mouth...HEY! There goes my brother...gosh! DUMB FISH! Oh well, it entertains me! But poor worms! They die for no reason...I feel bad tearing them apart...then their guts going everywhere...okay! I think you get it now!    Well, that's it!!! Cya later...and hopefully I can keep this one up!!!                                   *~Jennifer~*

        Hey! Wow...I haven't written for a while...but lately I've just been working and hanging out with my available friends. hehe. Wow, Vanessa and I have SO much fun at work...just making fun of Brian can keep us entertained for 5 hours! Like him burning all the bread, but yet it was partly my fault bcz I didn't know which knob to turn so I turned all of them!!! haha. Anyways...yeah...But Wednesday, June 14, Me, Laurel, Daryl, and Jillian went to Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom!!! That is actually the 2nd Theme Park I've ever been to and it DEFINANTLY beat Holiday World! lol. Anyways...that was SO much fun...the highlight of my summer so far! And my B-day's getting really close!!! (JUNE 27) BIG 1.6.! Broom Broom! Jk...it's not even going to be fun bcz we have absolutely nothing planned for it. Though everyone else probably has something planned...for their B-days...it sucks to be poor! Or have parent's that are clueless and don't plan anything for you! Gosh! I SO badly want to do something. Or get a car, but I can't bcz my mom says that I have to save so I can get a really nice car...well hell, if I want a nice car that's going to take me until my Senior Year to save up for! And it still won't be a good car! Like my brother's got cars from my parent's...now look I'm the one who didn't drop out or the one whose too dumb to go to school and too lazy! I get good grades...I actually participate and I get diddly shit for my 16th Birthday. Now that I'm done with that topic...I am going to go, bcz I have to go to work 12-4! Cya there, not! lol...Bye!                                           *Jennifer*

        Hey! I haven't written for 2 days...but this is all what happened...!    Yesterday I went to softball camp...AgAiN. It's not that bad, bu yesterday it was SO humid. But we slid on a tarp thing and that was a lot of fun! Then that night my mom and I FINALLY died my hair brown!!! It's really pretty and it look's natural. But it is like brown with light brown tints and red tints too! It's weird, but it works really well!    So today I have to help with the softball camp and then come home for 2 hours, then I have to go to work 2-7! This paycheck is going to be awesome!!!! Like $200! I've only been making $66 or around in there! YES. I can't wait. Maybe I can get a car. But then gaurd...which I want to do and it'd be a lot of fun with my friend's, but I don't know. I really need to work and I get really mad at myself when I don't get things...like the routine and I can't go to the practices, so how am I suppose to learn the damn thing? OKay...well, it's almost 9 and I got to get ready for Softball Camp...Cya later.                                     *Jennifer*

        Hey! I haven't typed for 3 days...I've been kind of busy...like usual! lol jk. Anywho...this is how it went!    Sunday I worked 11-5...which hurts your feet like a mother! Then Monday we started Softball Camp for Harrison! We get to help all the kid's, which I find pretty fun.  I have been helping with the little kid's and they say the darnest things. Let me tell ya...And little Graves...Kirsten's sister, she's SO cute. Anyways, that's been fun! Except for having to get up early in the morning for it! That kind of sucks!    Last night I played volleyball with Elizabeth, Amy, Emma, Abby, and Claire! It was a lot of fun. Except you couldn't see the ball with the lights on, and you couldn't see the ball with the lights off. So it was kind of hard! But by like the 200th time I served I pulled a forearm muscle really bad! It hurt like a mother...! Okay...that's it!    Then today I went to the Softball Camp and then at 11:30 I had to rush home and get ready for work. Then I went there and had a blast! Tim's giving RAISES after his vacation!!!! YEAH bitch! lol. I'm so excited...and I'm making like $200 this paycheck! YEAH! This is great. OKay so...besides that Vanessa and I have a plan...can't tell you though!!! hehe. It's top secret. We're going to get him SO good. Can't wait!!! Well, I am going to go...Cya later!                                       *Jennifer*

        Hey! Wow, I haven't typed for 2 days...what have I done? I can't even remember! Oh I worked...lol. And I'm NOT a work aholic...I  just need the money! haha. Anywho...    2 nights ago...everyone's plans got mixed up due to missed and missunderstood messages... now that's how that night went.     Friday... I worked 11-2... It was fun. Then Jillian called and said we could have Tent Night at her house. So we did... We went to the Summer Blow Out...It was alright...but it had FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. I loved the font size 1 that says you have to pay $5 to get in and pay for your own food! How rejected...I thought churches were suppose to be friendly. Anyways... We did that and we ended up collecting Jill and bringing her back with us. It was a really fun night... " I thought I made it CLEAR that STUART'S not to HAVE any SUGAR!" -that was hilarious. And..."Summer Blowout RIGHT here...(While we are roasting hotdogs and I was holding one near my crouch!)" lol. It would have been even more fun if Brittney would have came. I feel bad... like we're leaving her out, but I really don't think we are. Like I mean we invite her, but she rejects or if we don't she get's mad. I'd see where she'd get that, but I dunno. I really just don't want to be the mean one. Plus I haven't got to talk to her much...even though we were in the same sport... I guess she didn't want people to know we were friends. So that's how I took it. So I let her be herself and now I feel really far apart from her and I feel awkward...I don't know how to explain it, but if you read this... talk to SOMEONE. And don't be mad. I mean you can...but just start talking to us again. We know you can. We also swam at like 10 and had a fire!!! It was great...we got to do it again, but those damn birds woke me up!    Now, today I swam and layed out and I started out with a migrain, but thanks to Jillian's medicine cabinet I felt better 20 minutes. Then I left at like 2:30... and got ready for work! Since I AM a work aholic... OKAY! lol. Anyways, I got to work with Vanessa which was SO much fun~! We always have a blast. Anyways... that's about it. And I got online and realized I haven't typed in this thing for a while...so I think I'm going to go back to chit-chatting! Cya later.                                            *Jennifer*

      Band Camp... Oh yeah... WHO ever thought I'd be the one to say, "One time at band camp...?!" NOT I!    So yesterday I was at work and Laurel shows up with Daryl and Daryl shows up with Jillian...I told Laurel to come at 3:30 and they were there at 1, which makes them have to shop for 3 hours. Haha... Well, then I was told that I was going to Band Camp at 7:30 in the morning to join "Color Guard." So I was being a good friend and I did it. It was kind of hard...but the thing that hurt most was my arms from yesterday's softball banquet. Since I pitched some, holding that pole  killed  my arm... The marching was getting on my nerves bcz my feet don't move while my brain is set on counting. So afterwards we went to CiCi's and had some food...it was good and all, but like we all felt sick afterwards, probably bcz of marching and crap! So...that's my life so far... I might go to Jillian's at 4:30 to swim bcz I am DYING of hotness...    Yeah, we also got our report cards today... I got...  For The Grading Period: English: A History: B Art: A Spanish:B Math: A Health: A Careers: A   Exam Grades: English: B History: I exempted it! Art: A Spanish: B -that bitch was hard! Math: I exempted it too! Health: B Careers: A  My Semester Grade: English: A History: B Art: A Spanish: A Math: A Health: B Careers: A  My GPA: 3.7    Am I good, or am I good? Well, yeah...that's mine. I am going to go now bcz I want to watch a movie! Cya later!                                  *Jennifer*

        So lately I have been looking at Away Messages, which are hilarious. If you haven't read them when I'm put them up, you're missing out! LoL!     I drove around today...my mom and I went to Dollar Tree, Post Office, and TaRgEt...-my favorite! I got flip-flops, a skort, and white shorts. But did we buy Finding Nemo?! NOPE...uh. Makes me SO mad! There was a price cut...$14.99... gosh. She always says...not this time...and she's been saying that since NOVEMBER when the movie came out. I also was in the kid section and saw that *Bling *Bling shirt. Most definantly for Jillian not me bcz it was a small. LoL. Anyways...I got Jillian that shirt finally! She's been talking about it F-O-R-E-V-E-R! LoL....jp-I Call it! So nothing really went on today with me! But tomorrow is a different story! I'll type it now bcz I know I won't have time to type it tomorrow.    So I have to work from 11-4...finally they got me some hours in. I need them really bad too! So anyways...where was I? Oh yes, work. So then I go home, change and go to our SoFtBaLl Banquet. Which should be fun. It's for our awards and everything. I'm ExCiTeD! I know I won't win anything, but hey, I get to see some friends win stuff. Then I am going to come home or go to someone's house. Sad thing is...I dunno who's yet! LoL...probably Laurel's...nah...she's got ***PrE*** ~Band~Camp~! FuN... Maybe Jillian's...nah...I was there 2 nights ago during the storm. I feel bad for the Cooper's...anytime the wind starts blowing at 3 MPH their power goes out! Right?! LoL. I always come home to light! Ours has only gone out once...so that I know of. Okay well, Jillian is coming to get her shirt and I need to give Amy that one book. And THEN my mom is making me clean my room! UH! Okay...ttyl...Bye!                                                *Jennifer*
