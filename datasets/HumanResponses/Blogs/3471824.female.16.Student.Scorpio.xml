       And it is now math class. I just finished off a graph about crime rates, so I have a few minutes before I need to go back to class.  I'm considering quitting MUDwolf permenantly. It's not THAT good a game anyways- there's so many out there that are far better- and it's rigged. Rigged games suck. Especially when it's rigged against you. I'll NEVER become an Immortal, even if I do reach level 50 someday! And it's because of that little @#&*ing b#^&# Saskii! If I ever became an immortal, she'd whine and complain about not being one (she's been bugging magden for longer to become one) and if she becomes an immortal, chances are she'd kill me. Repeatedly. In the game, of course. But it's no fair! I've been working so HARD helping newbies and such, and Az, who never does anything but CHAT, just became one! I could scream for all eternity. What's the point of working to become a level 50 (and an automatic immortal) if I wouldn't be permitted to become one anyways!?

       Just another really boring morning. Once again I find myself sitting here at this same computer, trying to pass the time between getting off the bus and my first class of the day. And yet I have never been able to shake the realization that my friends are off talking to their real friends outside in the halls. I can't seem to forget that they'd rather be with other people.  MUDwolf is seriously unfair. I've been helping snivelling newbies for gods knows how long now, and still I'm not even considered for immortality. Whereas Azuriel, who does NOTHING but chat all the time (seriously), has now become one. I deserve it way more than she does! I actually DID something. But nooooooooo. Supposedly it's because of that b**** saskii...

       Like I said already, I can't think of a title. Ho hum.    My life is it's usual depressing, irritating self today. One good thing is that I found out what I needed to do in Pokemon gold today (hey, the story and show suck, but the game isn't all that bad. Plus I don't have anything better to do), which is defeat the gym leader in Goldenrod city. I could've sworn I already did that...but everything in the game itself seems to disagree. Ah well, it'll be a snap anyways. My quilava, Fred (I name all my pokemon monotonous, boring names for no reason at all), is around level 32, and all those people who challenge me have wimpy pokemon that are around level 10! Hah! Pathetic!  But enough of my gameboy rambling. It's probably boring everyone to death. Not that anyone would be reading this anyways... I wish I could fully retreat into my own world, just to get away from this torture called life. If this is all life is, then I don't want to live at all.  Whoever said 'better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all' was just trying to make themselves feel special. It's exactly the opposite!  Just a few more hours of school left. And then I can go home! And go on the computer! Of course, I'm on one right now, but we're not exactly permitted to play games at school (well, duh. It's SCHOOL). Most people play games anyways, but that's usually when they're not in the classroom when the teacher is practically looking right at you. That's just asking for trouble. And I'm not too fond of getting caught playing games and being sent down to the office and getting a lecture from the vice-principle who probably doesn't even know my name or remember me. So I'm writing in my blog- hey, it's not like I have anything better to do. Oh, yeah, and I'm writing a list of roleplaying stereotypes, just to vent some anger. Here it is so far: Roleplaying stereotypes/clichés/over-done things 1)	Assassins 2)	Ridiculously attractive runaway elf princess warrior ‘maiden’ sluts 3)	Killing for stupid reasons 4)	Vampires 5)	Big, strong; masculine heroes who go off on whirlwind adventures and save the world too many times to count; screw half a million women who practically worship him; seduce some virgin empress, sleep with and then abandon her; Has rippling golden hair, perfect teeth and loads of charm; Becomes rich in the process; is a strong defender of ‘good’; and has some magical sword with a long and majestic name. 6)	Mary-sues in any gender 7)	Young, heroic, brave wizards with half a million females madly in love with them   Yup, that's all I've come up with so far. And they all REALLY tick me off. Vampires and Assassins have to be THE most over-done of all those though. I mean, come on! In all the rps I've ever been in, only a handful of other characters have been something other than a vampire or assassin! Seriously, can't they be at least a BIT more original!? It's not like I actually go LOOKING for vampire/assassin rpgs and join them just so I can whine about how many of them there are! The only good rp I've ever been in with vampires or assassins is this one on Elftown called Lethargy. In that, there's a total of one human (Mortis), around ten vampires and/or assassins(Kula, Eve, Wulfgar, Gelina, Jahn, someone or other....), and only ONE character of another race- my character (Syth). And there's no-one playing an 'evil' character, aka antagonist. NO PC ANTAGONISTS! NONE!! NONE!!! ZERO!! NIL!!! Z- Okay, I think you get the point. Even Mortis, who is-or was, I can't figure it out- a vampire hunter, has joined the 'good' side with the rabble of un-original vampire characters! Well, then again, so have I. At least for now. If I feel like it later on, I might decide to throw a wrench in the good guys' plan and join the 'dark side'. My character is pretty flexible in regard to loyalties- nobody really trusts her much, and she trusts them even less. Oh, the joy of messing with other peoples' plots- OH, SHUT UP!!!!!!! Ahem. Sorry. One of the people in the classroom was being sick.  Like I was saying, my character's pretty distrusting. That's partially because she's anti-social. In most of the rps I join, I use Syth as my character. That's because I have a really lousy memory, and it's hard to remember all sorts of different character names for a million rps (I join alot of 'em. Yes, I need to get a life), so by using the same character for all of them, it saves alot of effort. Syth's a half-elf. Well, technically more of a half-demon...

      Hello. To those of you who bothered to look at this, congratulations. Not like anyone would ever look here anyways.  This is the first post in my blog (well, duh) so if it sucks, don't complain. I'm not too good at this stuff (duh again).    I've created this thing for the sole purpose of being able to say that I own a blog. Yup. Not really any reason at all. No, wait, I'm bored, AND felt like having a place to go on and on about random things. Oh gods, I'm booooored. And angry. And depressed. I need a new hobby. Or a gameboy. Or both. But noooooo, my parents won't buy me a gameboy, or a game console of any kind! I'm lucky to have PC games. So I'm saving up to buy a gameboy. Which is harder than it sounds. You see, with an allowance of 10 dollars a month and the only other cash gaining opportunity being babysitting my little sister, I have to save up for a long time to get enough money to do anything with. Sure, I guess I should feel thatkful I live in a family that is well off and such, but oh well. I don't care. I don't FEEL very thankful at all. And my life SUCKS. Sure, it could be worse. I could be kicked out of the house and have to move in with the telletubbies. But it'd be pretty hard for it to get much worse short of a nuclear explosion nearby or something like that.   People don't make sense. I try so hard to fit in sometimes, I really do, but no matter what I do I just can't. I know I'm not like them. They know it too, and hate me for it. Well, that's how they act. I really don't have a clue what they really think about me. But their actions speak of disgust, of anger. I can't belong to this world. I don't know how to cope with so many things that life throws at me, and it's cost me so much. I'm beginning to think it's cost me my sanity.  Am I sane? Is this reality of mine some twisted path that should never be used? Is it 'wrong' to think this way? Even if it is, I cannot help it. I cannot change too many things about myself. There are so many things about me that I have no control over. And it seems I will never be able to control them. Yet all the other people around me can manipulate them flawlessly. Why does the world seem so alien through my eyes? It's the only one I've ever known, but is it fake?  Death. My biggest desire. I crave it's cold grasp, to be released from this shattered vessel and disappear into non-existence, where there is no pain. I want my life to be ended, and I want to be the one who ends it. And yet, I cannot. Something is holding me back from it. Fear. How ironic, that the only one preventing me from reaching my greatest desire is myself. My fear of pain keeps me from my death. Fearing pain is a human adapting, made to prevent us from potential danger. But this danger is what I WANT. I need the consequence of that action- after all, it is the only reason I would even consider the pain.  And so I live to see yet another day. Time passes strangely here in my own universe. A minute can seem like an eternity, while forever can pass like a second. So I don't know how long I've been isolated. Perhaps I am immortal and have lived for ages, or perhaps my existence hangs by a single thread and at any moment I could vanish. But I do not know. How can one know such things about themselves? Is it just me who is oblivious to fate, or do others know what will happen to them in the future? I suppose I shall never know. This illness keeps me locked inside myself, so that I can never escape to catch a glimpse of the world outside my cell. I seem to be spiraling downwards in a Maelstrom that I cannot stop. But what am I falling into? I cannot tell if this is insanity or sanity that I am approaching so quickly, but it seems that I will reach it soon, no matter what it is.  Is this real? Is my life a dream, a fantasy world created by who knows what? How I wish this was all superficial, that it never really happened. But how can I know? Even if I found out what this world is, it would probably be just another lie someone's using to manipulate me. Somehow I know that, even if this is a lie, it would change nothing. Even if I discovered this life wasn't real, I couldn't do anything about it. Why should I seek the truth when knowing it would not allow me to do anything about it?  Right now, I take things day by day, not thinking about tomorrow. For if I tried to think of the future, it would probably overwhelm me. I try not to consider the things that have the power to bring my world crashing down around me, because I do not know if there is any other world I could live in.

      Happy father's day. Woop woop. Yaaaay.  Just had breakfast. No coffee. Not that I drink coffee anyways. Unless it's french vanilla. That stuff rocks! I don't have anythign better to do, so I'm posting. School's finally over, woot woot, and tomorrow (which is monday) I'll get to gloat, since everyone else in my family still has school (those of them that go to school).  I'm going to be dragged along to one of my sister's soccer games today, all the way on the other side of the city. The only thing more boring than sports is watching sports! I swear, I'm going to VEGETATE. Ugh. But nooooo, today's father's day, so we have to stay together today! I hope I can sue my parents for this... We had a party last night. A bunch of hyperactive kids were running around the house, not to mention annoying adults who took over the house and played bad music all night. They probably got drunk, too. And now I'll probably haveto clean up after the obnoxious brats who messed up our basement. Fun.

      Why can't I ever think of a title? Ah well. Not like it's a very important skill. I mean, putting 'able to think up good titles on the spot' isn't exactly something useful you could put on your resume. But who cares? I'll just type in some random word or something I haven't updated in a while. I was too lazy, I think... Magden's going to abandon MUDwolf and start a circlemud game. Good idea, in my opinion. There's alot of really fascinating areas and such on the internet for circlemud. In fact, I downloaded the circlemud area creater (or AC) 9Don't ask why, I was looking for furcadia stuff at the time. Furcadia's boooooring. You can't carry more than one item at a time!). Maybe I could submit an area or something to him if I create it using the AC..... Too lazy to write more.

      ...and so I live to see another day. Just got back from ottowa two days ago, on saturday. At writer's camp right now at the university.  &nbsp;Wraith's here too. It's nice to actually know someone in the camp ahead of time. Usually I would just hang around a bunch of people who didn't know me at all and probably liked me even less. But I've changed since then, and if wraith wasn't here right now I probably wouldn't even try to make friends. But she is here, thank the gods, so I don't have to. She's been a better friend to me than anyone ever had before. I'm really going to miss her... &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm dying. I can feel myself slowly fade away. By changing schools again, all my parents are doing is alienating me (they seem to enjoy doing that to me...) and tearing away what I've become. For once, I actually know who I am, and they're taking it away. I don't think I'll survive losing myself this time...
