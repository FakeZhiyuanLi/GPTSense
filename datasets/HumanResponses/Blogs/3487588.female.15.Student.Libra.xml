      i've never had such a special feeling for anyone except him.. he has this charismatic smile which seems to brighten the day, since he smiles very seldom and his face practically crinkles up when he smiles whole-heartedly.. and i got reminded of ryan seacrest.. there's the twinkle in the eye.. maybe he has that smile juz bcos i am not in his life to make him miserable.. i am a miserable person and i cant deny it.. my mental msn messenger seem to be blocking off sooooo many pple that when i am alone with them, i have nth much to start a conversation with them that will last for more than a bus ride.. i juz cant open up to them except elin and lp and lydia and a boy, maybe two boys.. something is holding me back from carrying on with life.. i am changing, for the worse.. even though i have seemed to become more sensible like all humans do.. haiz.. suddenly, i found out that i have written out of point.. sorry abt that.. in the first place, i dun even know the exact reason how on earth i fell for him.. his good looks? the way he carries himself? the way he seems to always look like he's 25, maybe more than that.. i cant know more abt him at all.. he cant even remember me by name, i think.. so why on earth do i like a guy who does not know me at all? i love the things that i know abt him.. and i know that they are oredi enough to make me blind to his faults.. well, at least he's not malvolio or sir andrew.. and i hope he's not antonio, the gay of the play.. maybe i like the fact that he is able to be childish in a matured manner.. he knows when to be serious and when to be hyper.. unlike me..  he seems to be so near yet so far.. and this "angel of my life" seems to short to be one.. okae, why did i juz call him angel? heck.. maybe cos of the fact that i have not slept for more than twelve hours even though it is only 5pm in the evening..  [i slept at 11 and woke up at 4, what else do you expect but crap from a sleepyhead?]

      actually, i have long wanted to ask. why do pple i love always hurt me? why do pple i treasure make me feel neglected? somehow, i always want to be cherished.. but i never was.. ever since young, nobody cared abt me.. my father seems to be so much like a stranger to me.. he had bbeen flying to and fro even before i was born.. when i was in primary 3, he only came back from jakarta once every two or three months.. once, the entire family had to fly all the way there juz bcos he was bound by work.. i couldnt recall a time when we really had a family outing ever since i became primary 3.. i only recalled the family going to the haw par villa and the zoological gardens.. otherwise, we only started going for dim sums on sunday mornings occasionally.. up till now, even though he is no longer flying, he has been sitting the ferry to and from batam.. they always said that the companies in singapore closed down, so he had to be posted to the ones in indonesia.. ever since he was in indonesia, he had a mistress.. up till now, whenever he's at home, he would called back to talk to his mistress.. maybe cos my mother has lost her figure and appeal to him.. maybe it was her character and behaviour which made him feel irritated and he wanted to find comfort from other women.. really, i never blamed him.. i never blamed anyone else abt this.. i dont know why, but i felt nothing.. im not angry.. and only recently, i started putting myself in my mother's shoes to try to understand her.. and i learnt that, all she wants, is to have her children have a bright future.. she puts her children as her first priority.. she really loves the family.. but sometimes, i disappoint her thru my results, especially my combined humanities, it's a disgrace.. but sometimes, she can get really selfish.. and i cant blame her since she never got to enjoy life.. when she was born, her parents abandoned her.. her foster parents ill-treated her.. her husband has been cheating on her for a very very very long time.. but she could forgive her husband time and again cos she knew that he would need a woman to be there to comfort him when he is alone overseas.. and bcos of these, that i love her so much.. but towards my father, i knew little of him.. i remembered the last word he taught me for spelling in kindagarten was "durian", but i still cheated in that spelling test and in the end, i flunked. the teacher saw me cheating and brought me to the principal.. after that my mother was so angry that she literally threw me to the rough, concrete ground and my knees were bleeding, but she still walked away.. that time, i felt so helpless.. i never felt her love for me when i was young, she seemed to love caning kicking and biting me.. in kindagarten, she only got me to focus on mathematics.. at K1, i had to learn the multiplication table.. hello?! we only learn that in primary one. for english, i had no clue, i played guessing games for spelling.. there were teacher pets and i felt so envious.. in primary 3, the skool taught us science starting from the back of the textbook for science.. so i didnt know what is it called when salt is dissolved in water.. it was salt solution.. my mother asked me that question, i didnt know how to answer.. den she called me the black sheep of the family.. all the time, i asked my siblings to help me in my work, they only shook their heads and looked at how i was beaten and caned by my mother for not scoring well in my work.. so no wonder, i wanted to be a teacher pet, and i did become a teacher's pet in primary 5 and 6.. at that time, i felt so happy.. i thought to myself," hey, im not that useless afterall.." since young, i was a tomboy and befriended boys.. in primary one and two, my best friend was gordon.. but suddenly, we no longer talked to each other after going to separate classes.. in p3, p4, p5, p6, jun ming was my bosom friend, we did everything together.. we played with newborn kittens in his neighbourhood and we look with anticipation at the mother cat who seemed so tolerant of our mischief.. when the mother cat became sick and kept vomitting, we were both very worried.. for that few years, i felt so happy and without worries that i have found the best friend in town.. up to sec one, when we becamr separated by out psle results.. he went to the norm and i went to the exp.. our relationship started to fade.. and we slowly stopped talking to each other.. but i remember, we never argued before.. i was never angry with him before.. i trusted him alot that time.. still, we wrote to each other.. we became pen pals.. but i was always the one to stop writing.. in sec one, the name-calling started and i told him abt it.. he told me not to take it to heart and i tried.. i did.. but i couldnt.. in sec one and two, i found jasmine yip to be a veri good friend, i trusted her.. she was the first to know my crush on the 33-yr-old guy.. but it was only in sec 2, when i found out that she was a hypocrite, she never stood up for me when i was called a bitch.. instead, she "broke up" with me on founders' day.. she initiated it.. i did not object.. but we didnt become enemies, we only stopped contacting each other.. in sec 2, i tod elin and huiyi abt my crush on the 33-yr-od guy.. they sold me out and told other gals abt it.. they may deny it, but i know they did.. to think i trusted them.. in sec 3, i gave elin my heart.. but she actually unwitting broke it.. and up till now, i cant forget wad she did during the first skool semester and the desaru camp last year.. i felt so hurt.. i became suicidal.. i felt that nobody was there for me.. my family couldnt help much, there is the age gap.. the age gap between me and the second youngest in the family is ten years.. i didnt want to tell them.. fortunately, i turned to God.. he did ease my pain.. but as time passed, i felt like i was a great sinner.. i lied.. i swore.. and many things i did made me feel sinful.. i felt unworthy of His love.. i hated myself at one point.. soon, i hated the whole world.. i locked myself up.. and i crumbled in my heart whenever i felt abandoned.. i comforted myself.. i did everything by myself.. nobody was there to help me.. i didnt let God help me.. i dun know why.. but i didnt want any help.. even till now, words of encouragement and comfort from friends dun help anymore.. they showed their concern too late.. they could have done it earlier, so maybe i wont have depression.. now, i can only seek refuge from God.. but i am so scared that one day, even God's grace and love cant touch me anymore.. i am so scared.. till now, my heart has not been fully mended.. so im still aching and bleeding.. and my heart really hurts.. it is juz so unbearable.. i am so afraid that i cant take it anymore.. may God bless me..

      great.. my mother juz called me a loser.. i cant stand it anymore.. memories of her torturing me kept flooding into my mind nowadays.. i still remembered clearly of the  urlLink time  when she kicked me when i was squatting on the floor in order to sweep up the pencil shavings that i have accidentally spilled onto the floor.. she actually kicked me away and scolded me till i cried.. i cant forget what she did to me.. today, i have been studying the whole time when i was in skool.. yet, she called me a loser.. i really thought of pasting a post-it note onto my room door reading "the loser's room, do not enter or else you will be a loser like me".. but too bad, i have no more tears.. i only have anger in me.. i feel our relationship drifting away again.. argh.....! i have been trying so veri hard to improve the situation between us.. but i juz find it so hard when i dunnoe how to start when we have this generation gap.. i so want to tell her to stop quarrelling with my father in front of me and calling him useless [in bed and at home].. i want to tell her to stop it.. i want her to stop saying those bloody vulgarities like "f***".. i want her to juz shut up.. i want her to stop saying that she has done her duty by giving me food and shelter.. but has she ever asked herself, has she ever really cared about me? has she ever considered my feelings when she started calling me the black sheep of the family, and all the bad things abt me that she can fabricate in her mind when she is frustrated abt me? has she ever saw me as her daughter? did she regret giving birth to me? was i really an accident..? for so long, i have been asking the same questions to myself and looking for the correct answer.. i may have them in my heart.. but i have doubts.. i have always been doubting.. i have questions that will remain unanswered and that i know.. but still, i want to try to know.. since young, i never remembered her encouraging me like, "eunice, you can do it".. i juz need that sentence.. but she never said it.. when i was primary 5, she caned me so early in the morning before skool, before my maths exam paper.. why? cos she wanted me to get better results in my maths paper.. i didnt do anything wrong and yet she caned me till i had so many red marks on my legs when i went to skool.. i did no wrong..

      hey.. think i am addicted to blogging twice a day now..  every now and then i think of the 33-yr-old guy.. and so, every now and then i get reminded of him getting married in ten days.. i cant help but feel lost.. but i wont cry.. cos he didnt break my heart at all.. [cos i have no more tears to shed..] that's the advantage of infatuation.. you will never get your heart broken by the person you love so much cos he doesnt know you well enough to do so.. and he isnt close enough.. when you cant reach him and he cant touch you.. you are protected.. whereas, being together usually doesnt mean life will be as fulfilled as a life staying single.. being together means responsiblity and trust.. now, i cant afford to trust anybody anymore.. and i am too overwhelmed to take the responsibility of another person.. cant let love take over your life, dont be held back by it.. it's a waste.. mortal love will one day die down.. you cant keep looking back at the happy memories of the time you were together, it hurts even more.. you may keep comparing it with the present, and that is what i call irritating.. and it hurts alot.. to know that you have contributed so much to something which somehow, came to nothing..  my heart still hurts.. and it hurts alot.. and it hurts even more when i see the invitation letter to his wedding.. but suddenly, i feel so proud of him and myself.. [i know im weird.. you dont have to tell me..] i feel that i have indeed chosen a guy whom other women are willing to spend their life with.. that i have not made the wrong choice of liking this guy.. cos i could have wasted my love on a jerk.. somehow, i am proud of him cos he finally has a complete life; the love of his life, a successful career [a stable job, that is..] and true friends who will stand by him.. he has my blessings, and have been having it ever since i heard of his marriage.. i didnt hesitate to give him mine at all.. cos i know i cant possibly be as self-indulgent as orsino.. cos i know im not worthy of him right from the start when i fell of him.. i dont deserve such a wonderful man.. at all..

      ah...! i cant read without getting my face stuck to the book!! and i even borrowed 2 thick books from the library! how am i going to read the books finish??! great, i have a meeting tmw even.. how am i gonna take down the minutes!? okae, i guess im over-reacting.. today's veask day and i was dragged from my cosy and comfortable bed to accompany my mother to her praying at a smoky, squeezy and faraway temple.. showed her the black face the whole time i was there.. she keeps thinking that there's no such thing as Christ and only believe in Buddha.. she keeps saying, "i only believe what i see.".. yea right, i dun even remember her Buddha blessing us.. i oso believe what i see wad.. God does answer my prayers.. he does create miracles, juz like the time when the senior contingent looked to pathetic and still got a gold medal + the most prestigious prize; the challenger shield.. wasnt God watching over us and blessing us? so what if i can see ghosts.. so what if i saw one at home? thst doesnt mean that there's Buddha.. i think if these goes on, i'll be back to a free-twinkle life again.. okae, maybe not..

      hey... i juz wanna inform you pple that i probably wont be coming back to blog until it's the 22nd november [end of 'o' levels].. or maybe the 23rd, cos i may be too tired to update my blog after all the celebrating on the 22nd.. haha..  i've been feeling so down.. but still, when the day's over, i seek guidance and comfort from GOD, and man is it relaxing.. imagine juz telling Him everything you are thinking of in your heart and He listens.. He's the only one i trust now.. the only one whom i trust whole-heartedly.. the one i am not cynical of.. the one i want to depend on.. others are too hard to depend on, too difficult to trust, too busy to listen to me.. i find it hard to get them to understand, to empathise..  ah yes, i've learnt to love my enemy and i'll remember to turn the other cheek. so TIMOTHY SIM, since you've slapped me for 3 years on the same side of my cheek, i'm gonna let you slap on the other without flinching this time.. but i think i'd better get some painkillers, or else i'll die of pain and lack of dignity.. and remind me to do that, cos humans normally dont practice wad they preach.. and pple tend to have the brain of a goldfish when it comes to memory.. maybe i should read some books on neuroscience to know more about brains.. oh yes, some books on psychology too.. man, why cant i study on subjects i'm interested in!? man, im sick of dissecting guppies and frogs.. i wanna dissect bigger things!  btw, nowadays, i've been feeling dizzy, giddy, mainly cos i have low blood pressure suddenly.. imagine, i've to hold onto railings everytime i go up and down the steps.. especially in skool.. haiz.. and man, those headaches irritate me..  and since this may be my last entry for 3 months, i wanna tell you pple.. everybody's self-righteous, esp when you think you arent.. so, before you comment on how self-righteous others are, look at how you're judging them.. in the book of luke, remove the plank from your eye before offering to remove the speck of dust in your brother/sister's eye.. a hypocrite is the one who judges..
