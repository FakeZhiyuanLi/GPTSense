      Firefox 0.9.1, and Thunderbird 0.7.1 have been released to fix some things, and to show off the new and improved Firefox theme!  In other Firefox news, apparently all of the viruses and worms and such are making strange bed-fellows.  The US-CERT (Computer Emergency Readiness Team) which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security is  urlLink advising  that people use Firefox (or one of the other non-Internet Explorer options).  Non-Firefox users beware however, that link WILL try to open a pop-up window of some kind (I don't know which because Firefox blocked it).  So now it is the patriotic and intellignet thing to do!

      Well, I was out enjoying an evening with my folks when a nasty thunderstorm rolled in with wind and lightning, and rain what whatnot.  When I got home my lights were kinda 'sketchy' and flickery and some things (like my computer and DSL modem) wouldn't come on at all!  I went to the back yard to check the breaker box, and realized that my old oak tree had not weathered the storm so well.   urlLink

      For all those bio-kids out there who like Macs, well now you can have your x-grid computing power, and not pay an arm and a leg for it (although you will have to delve into linux a litte).   urlLink This  cool new program allows linux and unix machines to interface with a Mac controlled x-grid cluster, making it suddenly a lot cheaper to add a few  urlLink under $300 Dell  systems to your cluster.  Of course, the pure of heart will use Linux and a  urlLink Mosix  cluster, avoiding the whole Mac business alltogether.  Home-brew  urlLink BLAST  servers anyone?  Interestingly, they use the same program ( urlLink POV-Ray ) to  urlLink test  their cluster that I did when I was keen on building Mosix clusters back in the day!  Also, apparently  urlLink these  crazy little cars are going to  urlLink start selling sometime this summer.   They sort of look like a duck to me, cool mind you, but cool like a duck.  I would probably still drive one (I'm sure girls would flock like mississippi-moths to a candle, after all Austin Powers drove  urlLink one  right?).  The real question is which  urlLink color ?  And do they come in a pack like skittles candies?

      Bush, *almost* top terror promoting US president of all time!?   Today saw some spooky things emerge on the political front.  First off the Bush administration  urlLink re-released   urlLink their   urlLink annual   urlLink report  on terrorism around the world.  According to the original version, which a lot of Bush supporters held up as support for his methods, terrorism in 2003 was at a 34 year low.  The new report (which apparently is still being revised and added to) shows a decline in deaths from 2002, but an increase in attacks, for a 21 year high.  Basically, the numbers for 2003 doubled in the new version of the report.  Given this new data (compiled by the president's own people and not some bunch of liberal whackos) I think it is safe to say that Bush is the second most competent president at promoting terrorism in recent history (apparently topped by Reagan 21 years ago?).  The totals go as such: 208 attacks, 3,646 injured, and 625 killed globally.  These figures apparently don't include the actions that Bush proclaims "the terrorists" are carrying out in Iraq.  Speaking of Iraq, the terrorists are  urlLink WAY BEHIND  US forces for numbers of dead and wounded during the Iraq war.  The administration is claiming computer errors as part of the reason for their mis-count.  3,646 is NOT a very big number for a computer, even a very old computer.  Either the first numbers were fudged on purpose, or the people who compiled them are not very bright.  I could probably do better with  urlLink Open Office  and back issues of the NY Times. Need I say more?   Here at home, another of the rights our troops are apparently fighting for was revoked.  The Supreme Court  urlLink ruled Monday  that if a police officer asks for your name, you have to give it or go to jail.  Apparently the police officer doesn't have to offer any explanation for his query.  This ruling was in response to a  urlLink Nevada rancher  who refused to give his name when asked.  So what I wonder is what happens if you lie?  Is it okay for the officer to demand an identification card?  If I can't show my registration-papers do I go to jail too?  Maybe it would be safer to just implant an RF tag in everyone with their social security number encoded on it at birth.  The technology seems to work well on fish....  Or we could just get a bar-code tattooed on our necks.  Good grief, how far will we go to "protect freedom"?   In other depressing news.. apparently my grandfather is more or less a nihilist.  And as they say in The Big Lebowski, "say what you want about the tennants of national socialism, at least its an ethos."

        Now as everyone who knows me knows, I am a fanatic when it comes to tricking out my honda civic.  With everything from low-profile tires to a level 3 exhaust kit, nos, custom decals, and a stereo system that makes old women weep, I thought I had it all (and could teach those Fast & Furious boys a thing or two besides).  That was until I found out about  urlLink Trunk Monkey .  Now I realize that my life, and my car is truely incomplete.  Watch the videos on that site and you will know why.

      For those of you who want to be all-kinda snazzy, there are some specially optimized versions of Firefox out.  Those with newer computers that have Pentium 4 or Athlon XP processors should get  urlLink this one .  Those with older cpus (Pentium 3 or Pentium 2's) should get  urlLink this version  (these cool builds are being done by  urlLink Moox ).  I think I would install the  urlLink official release  first, and then install the optimized version over top. Also, Mono (the opensource .NET replacement) came out in  urlLink Beta3  yesterday.  I haven't used it a lot yet, but between it and  urlLink Sharp Develop , things in the open-source C# and .net programming world are getting peachy.

      Ripples from 9/11 or is Nazism on the rise?  Normally I have a mild aversion to Country music, mostly because it seems to forward an anti-education, fairytale view of the world which encourages and celebrates ignorance and the wish to be ignorant.  Beyond this it seems that a good deal of the Country songs I've heard, play on emotions such as greed, fear, and pride with a "do it and let the consequences be damned" sort of attitude.  This approach seems to be especially appealing to those of a more conservative bent for some reason.  I think it is because these songs support the theory that people in the US deserve to consume more resources, than people in the not-so-promised lands.  Most popular Country music is merely a reincarnation of Manifest Destiny distilled into "music".   My dealings with Country music are fairly limited however, so I am sure that there is a fair amount which does not fall into this category.  Some sort-of-country music I even like; The Cowboy Junkies for instance are a bit country-ish, but a bit less gung-ho about running off from home at 17 to get married to the hot-headed abusive guy with an old ford pickup truck, tight jeans, cowboy hat, and no future.  The other day I was surprised, and sad to hear something quite a bit worse however.  A little research lead to the title,  Holy War  by Brooks and Dunn.  Let me quote the lyrics:  Some say a holy war is comin' Gonna be the end of mortal man There's a TV preacher sayin' Armageddon is at hand Sayin' the Jews, the Gays, the Junkies The Politicians and Infidels Have conjured up the devil Upon the gates of hell   I turn on the TV Lord I can't believe my eyes Oh Terror walks the streets While a million mothers cry Christians pray to Jesus Lord help us if you can Send Gabriel and his legions To defend his promised land   All it's prophets lead While the blind sheep they follow The path to damnation with no future no tomorrow Justice she may be blind Tall and proud she marches on Judgment day is coming God himself wrote that in stone   They say a holy war is comin' Gonna be the end of mortal man There's a TV preacher sayin' Armageddon is at hand They said fire rained down from Heaven On the towers of Babylon Oh the innocent the sinners They all died as one   Now victory will be mine All feeble and good say But in the end and in its own way Righteousness will have it's way   Being from Idaho, I've seen a few skin-heads and the like from time to time (they thought they were really snazzy spray painting swastikas on the high school, or shouting racial slurs in college), so when I first heard this I thought 'good grief, being a hate mongering idiot has been popularized on a national scale'.  I think this might have been hasty however.  While the rest of album seems to be true-blue red-blooded defend freedom etc, this song seems laced with a heavy dose of cynicism.  I can't help but think that the lines about prophets leading and blind sheep following are awfully Nietzsche like, and apply as easily to any right-wing Christian group as they do to Osama and friends.  It seems to me that a Holy War is pretty much here, and our commander and chief prophet is leading a lot of blind sheep on a path to damnation.   urlLink Apparently 833+ Americans (people from the USA, not the rest of the Americas) have been killed, and 4704+ wounded.   This means that we have gotten about 1/3 as many people killed getting revenge for 9-11 as died in 9-11 (and a lot more wounded).  Besides this, apparently somewhere between  urlLink 9,000 and 11,000  Iraq civilians have died.  I ask those who are mathematically inclided to tell me... Who is the terrorist here?  Or are we still working under the assumption that 1 "American" = 8 brown-skinned foreigners.  I had hopped that we got rid of that, but maybe it has lived on in conservative right wing Christian politics, and it's mouthpiece to the masses, Country music.

      I was unfortunate enough to attempt to watch  Van Helsing  tonight.  This is without doubt the worst movie I have seen in years.  I am told that  Dude where's my Car  is worse, but if so it has got to tread in a realm of horridness which I can't imagine.  Van Helsing is what happens when a large pile of cow manure is mixed with an equally large pile of money, and then spattered on a wall with some kind of wood-chipper.  I would have thought it was a spoof and laughed my guts out except that the actors took themselves so seriously.  Even their one-liners are delivered like a sack of severed heads--lifeless.  The story is nearly non-existent, the cuts between scenes make home videos seem professional, and the dialogue would have been more believable if written by chimps.  Round this combination out with actors who's fake accents are so fake you can't tell whether they are supposed to be from Brooklyn or Transylvania (probably they don't know either), repetitive fight scenes which go on and on, and a number of obvious theiveries from other successful movies, and you have Van Helsing.  I mean, for God's sake, any movie that rips off Tuco's "if you are going to shoot shoot, don't talk" is pretty questionable to begin with, but when it combines that with a "007 gets outfitted by quirky inventor" rip things get ghastly.  I have never seen so many things explode into green goop, so many people/creatures hurled, dropped, squashed, or battered with little obvious effect, or so many "harpy carries thing while making funny faces" scenes in one setting.  Nor do I hope to ever again.  I watched most of the second half of this movie in fast forward (thank God for DVD technology) at this speed, and without sound it is almost bearable.

      After an uncomfortably long wait, Michael Moore's new film,  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  has a  urlLink trailer  up and is scheduled to come out  urlLink June 25th .  Apparently it will be distributed widely.  I just hope that means Idaho because I plan on going, and I'd rather not have to drive out of state to do it.  Also I put some new photos up on my  urlLink photos page .  There will probably be even more soon.

      More anti-Internet Explorer news out today.   urlLink According to ZDNet  apparently the I-Lookup search bar people (shall I say shoddy-rotten scheming bastards?) have been exploiting a couple of bugs in Internet Explorer to install spy-ware and add-ware programs on computers when people either open an email or view a web-page in Internet Explorer/Outlook/Outlook Express.  The malicious program then pops up porn adds etc every few minutes.  I thought I'd been hearing an awful lot about spyware being installed lately, but good grief!  Could Microsoft open the gates any wider?  To make matters worse,  urlLink apparently 80% of spam  comes from infected Microsoft Windows PC's!  Once again, I beg all literate self respecting computer users to PLEASE use  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  for web browsing and  urlLink Mozilla Thunderbird  for email.  If not for their own sakes, then for the good of humanity.  It is probably also a good idea to keep a copy of  urlLink Adaware  handy, or at least sanitize your computer with it if you have ever used Internet Explorer  In other news....  The bards are still dreaming up songs about Reagan despite the fact that he  urlLink doesn't really deserve much credit for ending the Cold War , increased the deficite to never before seen highs,  urlLink sold arms to know terrorists , etc....  Here is a  urlLink book  about him by a *local* author.   urlLink Cowboys may someday be replaced by wi-fi , so could I be a wi-fi-cowboy?  Would I have to wear the boots?  Meanwhile... the Bush administration  urlLink apparently   urlLink favors   urlLink torture , and are trying to use  urlLink legal manuvers  to get around The Geneva accords against torture (formed because of Hitler I believe).  NPR has a 52 page  urlLink leaked memo  on the subject as well as an  urlLink interview .  What ever happened to "what goes around comes around"?  Maybe they are trying to incentify our soldiers to fight to the death since they know they have no right to except humane treatment if captured.  Despite party affiliations, Senator Craig (from here in Idaho) is quoted as saying something intelligent.. "I hope that in the end, Saddam Hussein will not have taken away from us something that our Constitution, in large part, granted us, and that we have it taken away in the name of safety and security."  Maybe I will have to re-think my opinion of him.  Saddam has become a more potent "terrorist" in defeat than he ever was while in power, even when he was our  urlLink friend .  Of course he was never actually involved in the 9/11 thing at all, so mostly this is the Bush administration jockying for power.

      Wooho!, Firefox (my favorite browser in the whole wide world) is up to  urlLink 0.9rc1  (release candidate 1 for the un-initiated).  Firefox was already awsome, and it keeps getting better.  It makes IE look like a model-T in comparison.  It blocks pop up adds and doesn't install horrible viruses or allow web pages to run malicious code.  As if these reasons weren't enough, it also supports a cool feature called tabed browsing which allows you to open multiple web pages in the same window with a simple middle click. Release notes can be found  urlLink here   You might need the  urlLink Macromedia Flash Player  as well as  urlLink Macromedia Shockwave  player.  Install these after installing Firefox.

      I am afraid that this blog will mostly be a rant... maybe I will try to alternate.  So my old father (aka Geeze) sent me a review of a pretty interesting and disturbing book:  HOME FRONT The Government's War on Soldiers by Rick Anderson Foreword by FRANCIS A. BOYLE  ISBN: 0-932863-41-8    Among other disturbing statistics, it points out that although only 148 soldiers were killed in the 1991 Gulf War 11,000 have died since.  These casualty rates are due to a mix of problems which don't include old-age.  Apparently military personnel are frequently not provided with adequate medical treatment during and especially after wars. They are sometimes even used as guinea pigs for testing new medicines which sometimes cause horrible problems.  Who knows what the long term consequences of our current *operations* will be.  Maybe 20,000 or 30,000?   Now, I am generally not pro-war by any means, but I am even less in favor of treating people as disposable resources.  I've noticed that it is in vogue to refer to a soldier as a "troop" lately.  Maybe this is due to the women in the military thing, but it comes across as if they are a small version of a humvee or something.  It seems to me that even if we put someone in camouflage, have them do a lot of push ups, and give them a gun, they are still human.  Or am I missing something here?  Various futurists have claimed that someday wars will be fought with robots.  This won't be the case.  The reality is that our leaders already view each "troop" as a cheap disposable robot.  Why go to the expense of fixing them when more will roll off the assembly line at any moment?    Anyway, follow these links for reviews of this book:    urlLink http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/print.asp?ID=1904     urlLink http://www.bookmasters.com/clarity/b0025.htm    Maybe buy it?  I don't know, perhaps something more potent than yellow ribbons is in order.  Maybe we shouldn't commit ourselves to a war if we are not willing to support those who we send to fight it?   At this point, we probably all know someone who is in, is going, or might go to Iraq.  Are these people disposable to you?

      Today was quite an exciting day.  It started off fairly ho-hum with some lawn mowing and car washing, but quickly ramped up when I donned a pair of wranglers (YES.. REALLY.. and in 100 degree weather none the less) and went for a little bit of a horse ride!  I am not what you would call an “experienced rider” by any means, having only ridden three or four times in my life, so it was a bit of an adventure (and  urlLink Kendra  got a few good laughs on a number of occasions).  None the less, it was quite a lot of fun, especially the whole  urlLink cantering thing  which is as fast as I've ever gone on a horse before.   The horse I rode is named Trail.  His primary joys in life seem to consist of eating weeds (he needs a bumper sticker which says I BRAKE FOR PLANTS) and leisure.  Partly because of this, and probably partly because of my lack of experience, he got a bit uppity about the whole riding business on occasion and did some little jump things which I guess are called "crow-hops".  These were a little scary, but quite exciting, and other than this he was very nice, if a bit lacking in the enthusiasm department.    It quickly became obvious to me that I need to learn how to sit a horse properly however.  Certain bones in my less than amply-padded-butt seem to have taken their fair share of beating, strange muscles in my legs are sore, and on a couple of occasions (usually during that trotting part) I seriously wondered how real cowboys manage to further the species....  A couple of times I did sort of get into the rhythm and things went much more smoothly, so I suspect that practice is probably a key factor here.  Anyway, Kendra was nice enough to get photographic evidence of this adventure (see above), so here is a really big THANKS to her for that, and for an exciting afternoon! :)

      Although they are more or less the spawn of Satan, as the Bowling for Columbine documentary points out, Lockeed Martin is  urlLink apparently gearing up to be the Linux  using spawn of Satan.  I guess even they can't pass up free software. In other news, last night was wonderful for a little jog, with a big full moon, and temperatures in the mid 70's!  Unfortunately the Caldwell Natives were out in force.  One car full of them even managed to pool their intelligence enough to come up with "run forest run" which they hurled out of their window at me.  About 3/4 a mile later I got harassed by a pack of un-chained, un-fenced dogs, so I went home.  I still haven't decided which group was more intelligent, but I'm leaning towards the dogs. p.s. If anyone can explain why Idaho hicks dislike joggers and bicyclists so much that would be great.

      10:01 P.M. - Well, I'm back at work again.  The time has come for the final live test of the inventory beast. 10:24 P.M. - Problems.  There is no DISK there, it is always the LOWEST and most downright repugnant of technology that gets us in the end.  So, I'm going on a Mission From Gawd (ala Blues Brothers) to get the data from a contact in Boise..... 1:21 A.M. - The mission was a success, after approximately 60 high speed minutes on the interstate, and a few tense moments copying the file to a laptop for backup, I am now waiting while my python script crunches the data.  The first three items went through perfectly, and so far everything looks to be going wonderfully. (touch wood)  2:38 A.M. - Some minor bugs in the code cause some delays, and lots of careful checking at each step caused some more, but it looks like everything went pretty smoothly. 3:20 A.M. - Upon reaching the old homestead, I found that my roomate was still up, and not feeling well in the stomach.  Her supply of pepto had been exhausted however, so, being the nice guy that I apparently am, I was off on yet another Mission From Gawd, this time to Walmart.  Having made it back safely, I think I will try and find out how deep the bottom of sleep is. 12:58 P.M. (the next day) - I got a call this morning at 8 A.M. saying that things were ready for the next major step in processing, so with 4.5 hours of sleep and some coffee con leche in me I headed back for another 3 hours of going through code and data with a fine toothed comb.  As it turns out there were a few small bugs, and one major one caused by a set of circumstances I  hadn't predicted which necessitated a little last minute programming.  Such is life.  On the upside, all of the data looks very good now and has made it to its final resting place, and so the first live test has been labeled a success.  Needless to say, I'm going home a bit early for a nice long nap in an hour or so!  Then it is lawn mowing time and after that I am busting out the old air-compressor and doing some major computer cleaning (so besides other clean systems, there will be a nice shinny pile of parts waiting to be assembled into a Linux machine by the end of the night).

      Well, after almost two months (6-7-2004 until today) of pretty solid development, ending in a mad two week rush of carrot stick eating and programming.  The huge new inventory maintenance and processing system which I more or less masterminded and programmed with the other two guys here at work has passed initial tests, and is ready for prime time tonight!  Parts of it are written in 5 different languages (c++, python, delphi, java, and php).  It ties together data entry via pc and wireless scanner gun in a mysql database running on a Linux server with web reports served by Apache and php, data processing, and finally import into an IBM AS400 mainframe.  There are a few areas for improvement of course, and some parts will need to be reworked as we get feedback from users, but HOT DAWG it is good to finally get to a stopping point.

      6:01pm - Okay, so I just saw the first 11 minutes of  urlLink Blues Brothers ... and WOW.  I have very little doubt that this movie rocks. 8:24pm - Nearly 2.5 hours of my life later, and has my estimate of  urlLink Blues Brothers  changed?  Not drastically.  I was a bit nervous when  urlLink Pricess Leia  started shooting at them with a rocket launcher, but they took it in stride, so I figured, why shouldn't I?  This movie is certainly packed with big names, good music, and plenty of old-school car chase action.  It is like Grand Theft Auto - Vice City, when you have 5 stars and things are getting REALLY serious except it is in Chicago.  Staying cool and being able to sleep through a night long car chase with 40 cops on one's tail seems to be the ticket however. I NEED to find "Boots, black.  Belt, black.  One black suit jacket.  One pair of black suit pants.  One hat, black.  One pair of sunglasses.  Twenty three dollars and seven cents."

      Fajitas are one of my more favorite foods, and now is the best time to make them.  I start with a packet of fajita seasoning, mix it with some oil and a little water, and then put a sliced up steak in this mixture to soak. Meanwhile I slice up tomatoes, a jalapeño, a big onion and lots of peppers (green, yellow or red).  I start the onion and jalapeño frying first so that their taste will be less strong, and then add the peppers.  Once these have cooked for a bit I add the meat and tomatoes.  It is best to add the meat later so that it doesn't get overcooked.  Finally I put the mushrooms on, and when they look done it is ready to eat!

      I looked in the mailbox the other day, and much to my surprise, there was a REAL letter in there (usually bills are the most exciting thing which come in the mail).  Even better, the letter had stamps which said Mexico, and a postmark which said Cuernavaca!  Inside I found a birthday card, a "Sinceramente Hallmark" birthday card.  Now to head off any confusion, my birthday WAS in fact a number of months ago, and apparently that is when this card was mailed.  The postal service between here and Mexico is not terribly prompt however and it seems that my card had been sitting in the Cuernavaca post station until they finally shipped it out on the 7th of July.  Despite all that, I was grinning like the Cheshire cat when I opened the card.  It came from a cool girl I met in Mexico named Nina.  She is a chef from Norway and taught me a wonderful recipe for salmon.  I like cooking a lot, but even better is learning new tricks from someone who knows how to cook well, so cooking with Nina was quite a treat. Here is the salmon recipe: It is best to start with the sauce because it takes a long time to simmer.  It is very simple to make, just put some cream (of about whipping cream thickness) into a smallish sauce-pan.  Stir in dijon mustard (I use the normal kind, but the honey type might be good too?) until the mixture turns a little yellow.  Heat it until it is boiling a little bit, and keep adding mustard if it isn't as strong as you'd like it.  Adding some sugar is also not a bad idea.  When the sauce has boiled down to the point that it is sort of thick, especially if allowed to cool in a spoon, it is done.  Put some dried dill in it at the very end, and maybe half a cube of fish bullion if you can find it. (Experimentation and tasting frequently is key here). Once the sauce is going, slice up an onion or two, and maybe some garlic etc.  Put these in a big pot full of water, and add a few fish bullion cubes (maybe impossible to get in Idaho, so I use vegetable ones instead).  Bring this to a boil, and meanwhile cut your fillet of salmon into nice serving sized steaks (wash it well, but leave the scales on).  Once the water is boiling turn the heat off (yes I'm sure), and dump the steaks in.  They will cook quite quickly in the hot water, so check them every few minutes.  Once they split very easily with a fork they are done.  Don't overcook them or they will flake apart and you will have fish soup. Serve the fish and the sauce with a nice salad and some noodles.  For those extra-special occasions a bottle of wine goes well with this combination.  Of course, we had it with copious amount of chips and home-made-guacamole in Mexico ;)  Viva el aguacate, ajo y cebolla!

      I guess I better start packing a can of mace, and a cell phone on my evening runs.  Tonight a big black shinny SUV and a smaller white car where clandestinly parked window to window in the darkest, most remote section of my usual route.  Maybe it was just a happy couple meeting for a late night chat, but I certainly ran quietly, and with heart all a flutter as I passed them in the dark.  I really wish Caldwell would invest in some decently lighted biking and jogging paths.  Oh well, I guess it's better to die of gang violence than heart disease.... Right? Interestingly I had a run in with the other end of the spectrum on my way back from New Meadows last Saturday.  I was following a big shinny blue pickup down out of the mountains, listening to Led Zeppelin, and not paying attention to my speed when the pickup and I passed a police officer going the other way.  In my rearview mirror I saw him brake and come about.  Looking down saw that I was going about 65.  After pulling me over, the officer explained to me that the speed limit stayed at 55 until I got to the other side of Cambridge, and then changed 65.  Nuts I thought, my first speeding ticket after 7 or so years of getting away with all manner of moderate speeding!  He then went on to explain that he was going to turn the drug dog loose on my car, and that it would "throw itself against the car if it found something" but not to worry because that just meant he could then search the car.  To further increase the pressure, he told me that if I admitted to carrying anything before he turned the dog loose he promised to give me the mildest citation possible.  To admit, and keep the dog off, apparently I had to stick my arm out the window and wave while he was filling out paperwork.  I kept my arms firmly in the vehicle, and when he came back he asked if I'd thought about his question.  I told him I did not have anything like THAT in my car, and he sent me on my way.  No dog, no ticket, hardly even a warning.  I think he was wishing he would have gone after the blue pickup. In more cheerful news, according to  urlLink this set of benchmarks  my computer will play  urlLink DOOM3 !!!  This game is so freaking cool and scary that I hardly dare visit it's web site at night with my speakers on.  I'm not sure whether I'm looking forward to playing it, or dreading the nightmares more.  Oh well, "Bring it On", "Hurt Me Plenty", "I'm Death Incarnate" here I come (God but I've missed the good old fashioned Doom carnage.  Ever since I figured out that I could exit windows 3.1 and play Doom 1 shareware in DOS mode on my parents' 486sx 25mhz with 4 megs of ram, it has held a special place in my heart.  Yes, those were the days.)

      	Work was exciting today.  One of my servers has been acting up lately, running really slowly, having trouble keeping up with it's work load, etc.  Initially I was afraid that it had gotten hacked and was doing bad things, but as I examined it, I realized that it was just getting flooded by a constant deluge of spam!  The poor old server was so busy bouncing all of this spam back that it didn't have much time for processing other things.  Each piece of email that comes in has to pass through a huge list of filters which try to deny any email that looks suspicious.  There are thousands of entries to parse through for each email, so when a spammer dumps a huge load of spam on the server it has to do a lot of processing.   Luckily we had a spare system sitting around in case of emergency, so now we've upgraded from 450mhz of spam blocking power to 1.9ghz.  Hopefully that will be enough for now, but I imagine that I'll have to look into more potent anti-spam measures in the future.  Apparently black-lists are all the rage.

      Well, amazingly enough I made it back from Reuter's birthday party more or less unscathed.  I say amazing because Reuter did manage to dole out two bloody noses in the 18 or 20 hours that I was there.  There is one lesson I learned well quite some time ago and that is that Reuter is a dangerous animal and not to be approached lightly.  Plus, I knew from the thick pine forests that I was in Yetti country and Reuter is especially wild when he senses his own kind nearby.  For these reasons I kept an eye on him at all times.  On the home front: Apparently the damned varmint rock-chuck animals have been paying attention to this whole duct tape and sheets of plastic home-land security business because the chemical approach proved unsuccessful.  Instead of dying, they moved under the woodshed.  Old Man Geeze is not likely to let a few varmints get the upper hand so easily however, and has upped the ante by cleverly placing a fox trap in the entrance of their hole.  The next move is theirs.  And as a follow up to the SGI post: Apparently SGI pretty much agrees with me, as their next  urlLink big project  is going to be one Linux kernel stretched over 1024 processors and 3TB of RAM.  This thing is mammoth, has enough memory to put my whole life in, and has to eat power like a small town, but damn.  WHAT A MACHINE!

       Unfortunately there is no time for real posting or reading, but I am eyeing these articles with great interest (and testing this new "compose" thing with a bit of trepidation...):     First, the  urlLink Hitchhikers Guide to Biomorphic Software  talks about taking suggestions for biological systems for software design (super cool stuff in my opinion).       Next, an article about  urlLink tweaking everyones favorite web browser  ( urlLink Firefox  in case you forgot).     And finally, an  urlLink atricle about the groovy new software development platform  called Mono which is being developed as a compatible alternative to Microsoft's .NET platform. As far as I can tell, Mono will play a MAJOR role in widespread Linux adoption on the desktop in the future. I have already tried out the Rapid Application Development platform  urlLink SharpDevelop    which is a GPL'ed IDE for .NET, and Mono.  It was pretty snazzy.   I'm headed off to observe the Wild Reuter in his natural environment, so if I never post again, look for my mutilated corpse in New Meadows....

        So the other day I went with  urlLink Arzhang  to visit the SGI box which lives out it's lonely existance at BSU.  As far as I can tell, it pretty much qualifies as "BIG IRON" in the server market.  It has four processors for God's sake, is purple, and has SGI written on the front.  This should qualify just about any hardware as "BIG IRON".  Arzhang has a picture on  urlLink this  page.  Apparently most of these big SGI servers have 64bit MIPS processors, which is really cool because at one point I knew the basics of writing assembly language code for MIPS!  (Hooray for Dr. J).  They run a flavor of Unix known as IRIX.  IRIX was originally released in 1987 and has apparently evolved since then.   I have had a few chances at dealing with other big corporate type Unix based systems in the past but nothing so big as an SGI box, so I was expecting quite a lot.  I have to say that when it comes to usability, I was not very impressed however.  For example, the software install and packaging system is straight out of a Douglas Adams book.  There is no syntax highlighting when listing files or editing with vi, and to add insult to injury, there is no tab completion!  Hardware being the same, I would take a Linux command prompt over an Irix one any day.  The Irix desktop is is also a few years behind the curve, KDE and Gnome make it look pretty clunky.  The difference between the two is really quite striking.  Maybe the old Unix geezers (and don't get me wrong, I have boat-loads of respect for them) would tell me to stop my whining because they used to have to write 40 lines of code just to copy one file, but good lord, why haven't they AT LEAST written tab-completion into Irix?  It didn't seem to work under tcsh or bash!  To put it more poetically, Linux is like a young growing thing whose muscles bunch and ripple beneath ones hand, Irix is like a withered tree in the dead of winter, lifeless.  Maybe it is just that Irix is so old, but my hunch is that the difference lies in Irix's closed-source nature.  The people who use Linux can also change and improve Linux.  This insures that it is continually evolving to be better, faster and more streamlined.  On the other hand, Irix is reliant on a few programers who are probably paid too maintaining and create hardware drivers and other such system-level things, but don't get much time to spend making the interface snazzy.  Don't get me wrong here, I'm sure the big systems from SGI can process data like mad, and they seem to still have a bit of a niche, but as a lot of the big-name corporate software producers are finding, it is hard to keep up with OpenSource.  The expense of one of these SGI boxes is also incredible.  I would be quite suprised if an SGI box could outperform an equally priced cluster of Linux systems.

      Today marks another stride towards Linux World Domination as the  urlLink New Zealand stock exchange moves their database to Linux servers ! Apparently Oracle has produced a database server which runs on top of a stripped down Linux kernel which performs only the basic functions that a database server needs.  Because Linux is open source, Oracle was able to remove all of the extra stuff which one wouldn't want on a database server, and do any tweaking they found necessary.  This process leaves them with a lean mean machine which apparently is very efficient, cheap (they run it on standard Intel compatible hardware like servers from Dell) and of course very stable (because it IS stil Linux). My favorite quote: "We went for Linux, not just because we hated Microsoft, but because the cost was compelling,"  And... another day, another  urlLink FOUR  Internet Explorer security exploits.  If you are still using IE by this point you might want to have your head examined.

        Decided to give in to peer pressure and test this Hello thing.  It seems that everyone is doing it.  I have to say, it does seem pretty handy, especially with the whole resizing and blogger integration thing.  Apparently my user name is Sarcaza?   Today was quite the day.  Large strides were made towards de-varmitification of both my yard, and that of Old Man Geeze.  I wait on pins and needles for the sounds of the foul roving packs of wild dogs to hit the electric fence and leave my lawn un-fertilized.  Har-har-har.  Geeze on the other hand has opted for chemical warfare, and the old Alice in Wonderland song “We'll smoke the monster out!” comes to mind.  Also I rendered my first molecule in Linux today!! (All hail the o-great and powerfull Linux, destroyer of Windows and humbler of Microsoft, liberator of science departments, the one who will bring balance to the force.  Praise be unto thee, and mayest thou forever remain free.)

      I ran across a couple of cool sites on  urlLink Slashdot  today.  Basically  urlLink Carnegie Mellon  and  urlLink MIT  are putting a bunch of courses and whatnot on the web!  It looks like the MIT people have more in the way of coursework and lecture notes with no real opportunity to earn credits (but some interesting looking stuff to say the least), while the Carnegie people are actually going to offer classes for credit, except that you get the credit through whatever school you might be attending.  The coolest thing about the whole deal is that Carnegie Mellon has a chemistry course with a  urlLink VIRTUAL LAB !  Being a good student and all, I first did their dilute 1M Glucose solution to .025M problem.  I then decided to *test the system* by making something blow up (as far as I can tell, probability of explosion is the litmus test for all chem classes).  Unfortunately, it seems that they only allow things to get to 99.85*C and don't account for evaporation (believe me, I TRIED!).  This, the lack of highly reactive chemicals, and no tight-fitting rubber stoppers combined forces to thwart my plans.  Perhaps if I were a better chemist.... Meanwhile, my laptop is now running Mandrake 10, and after only a very little wizardry,  urlLink Autodock  and Autodock tools.  I think  urlLink Bobscript  and  urlLink Raster3d  are also working, but need to figure out how to test them.  I am told that these programs represent some of the finest in bio-chem  urlLink research .

      A bug was found in the Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox browsers which could let a malicious web page run code on your system!  (This makes one for Firefox, and like 20 for Internet Explorer, so I'm not switching back any time soon...).  Unlike Internet Explorer, a fix for this problem is already out.  Read about the same-day-fix  urlLink here .  Either you can download the new version,  urlLink 0.9.2   or install  urlLink this extension  (just click and it should auto-install).  It is important to keep in mind that Firefox is still a Technology Preview, and not considered a finished product by the Mozilla people.  For this reason it is important to update it occasionally.  (For the most part, it seems pretty damn polished to me though!).  In much cooler news, Mandrake Linux is making a big  urlLink SPLASH  in France where they are helping to replace a whole lot of Windows NT systems with Linux ones!

      Well, it looks like the boys in Hollywood are at it again.  Apparently a law will go into effect July 1, 2005 which will make it illegal to sell HDTV equipment which doesn't support a "Broadcast Flag".  This basically means that most of the recording/portability functionality of HDTV will be killed in all equipment made after July 1, 2005.  Of course, the EFF is  urlLink pretty nervous about this, and urging people to buy HDTV tuner cards for their home-brew PVR linux systems, and help out with the programming too .  Maybe it is time to look into a card.. but at  urlLink $200  they are a bit pricey.  Of course, when everything is broadcast in hdtv a few years from now I'd probably be happy I did.  Then again, does anything worth watching ever really show up on TV?

      	A good friend of mine who sometimes is called Miss Fyn, sometimes Fynnilicious, and occasionally Francesca de Argentina sent me an interesting tidbit.  Apparently Dr. Hunter, a professor at Cambridge University (she is no relation to me as far as I know – and que lastima too, I want to visit Antarctica!) did some observation of penguins and has recorded numerous cases of penguin prostitution!  Yes,  urlLink sex for pebbles .  Apparently some of the males seem to realize what is going on, while others think they are courting legitimately only to end up short a few stones and singing the blues.  What an odd world we live in. 	Also I went for a little bike ride with Isaac and Kristen tonight.  We were only out for an hour, but rode 15 miles over some fairly hilly terrain so it was a nice workout.  On one particularly steep downhill spot I hit 31+mph, a new personal record (and kinda scary on a bicycle).  The uphill spots went a bit more slowly.  Bicycling is certainly easier on the old joints than jogging however, and one goes SO much faster. 	A new release of  urlLink Firefox  (0.9.3) has come out to fix a few bugs.  If it seems like a nuisance keeping up with the updates, don't give up hope.  Apparently there is an auto-update feature in the works, maybe for version 1.0.  Plus, it is better to have an update to install, than to surf unprotected. 	And finally, I am headed off to a  urlLink conference  at  urlLink ISU  this Sunday which has me all excited.  Apparently there will be some heavy hitters there however, so I might be a bit out of my depth (at least in the bio and chem stuff).  I am looking forward to trying to hob-nob with serious scientists, and especially to making a long list of all the cool computer stuff a certain college near me needs to acquire.  I will take my laptop and try to look professional.  On the down side, this means I won't be here for the next two inventories, I will have my cell, but I am really hoping that late night calls won't be necessary.

      Wow, I thought that I was a hard-core tin-can-antenna kid, but  urlLink these guys  managed to shoot a 802.11b signal 55.1 miles without external amplification.  That is a long way!  Of course, they had some 9+ foot satellite dishes, so that probably played a big part in their success. In other news,  urlLink this server  is awesome.  Six hot-swappable scsi drive bays with hardware RAID 5, dual Opteron processors, a slim sexy 2U case, and up to 16gigs of ram.  Look at it shine in all of its 64bit splendor.  We might get one for our central server here at work, but three of them would look so nice running as a Linux cluster in my basement....  Anyone have an extra $10k? Today is another inventory day, the last one went fairly smoothly (all things considered).  A number of small things have been fixed, a few features have been added, and some things have been streamlined, so here's hoping that all goes well.  Needless to say, it could be a late night.

      	Well, I was going to go for a little run tonight to try out the new running shoes I got (and boy do they feel nice and springy compared to my old ones) but between lightning, wind gusts, a few drops of rain, and a certain spooky game which I played for a few hours earlier, I decided after about a block that not running would be the better idea.  Instead I finished the book  The Genius Within  by Frank T. Vertosick Jr.  It was a decently good book, with a few interesting ideas, but like most of the books I've read which fall into the "written by scientist for the general public" category, this one lacked something in literary quality.  I think this is a side effect of writing and reading tons of primary literature.  This sort of author seems to rely on very few devices, chief among them is making some claim which is mildly strange, and then going on for pages about how unbelievable we are sure to find it.  I sometimes want to scream "SHOW DON'T TELL!!" at them.  They also seem to rely on repetition far too much.  Read Part 1 of this book, and see if you can keep from cheering when “Poor Tom” (which apparently is his legal name)  finally kicks the damn bucket.  Anyway, on to the meat and potatoes. 	The core thesis of this book is that most, if not all living systems, can be understood more accurately as intelligent networks.  Many of the peer to peer file sharing networks like KaZaA are variations on this sort of network theory, and it is really sort of cutting edge stuff.  Unfortunately I have only read a few papers on it, so I am no expert by any means.   The idea is that one can get intelligent results out of many unintelligent entities by connecting them to one another, and then allowing them to modify their connections, create new connections, and destroy old connections based upon the amount of traffic which flows across these connections, and inputs from the outside world.  Vertosick's idea is that we can explain the apparent intelligence of bacteria rapidly evolving to deal with new antibiotics, immune systems memorizing huge lists of antigens, and other highly “intelligent” behavior by applying network principles.  He says that this intelligence is an “emergent property” of these large groups of communal entities.  For the most part, I find it difficult to disagree with his conclusions because they provide an enlightening way to look at the complexity in biological systems. 	In my opinion, his most interesting point is that there are many different manifestations of intelligence and that competition dictates that all surviving organisms must be about equally intelligent in one way or another, or they would have ceased to exist.  This is by no means a revolutionary statement.  What he is doing here is redefining intelligence to be what a biologist would traditionally call fitness.  In the same vein one could argue that all organisms are roughly equal in their fitness level or they would have rapidly ceased to exist already.  We can see this clearly in species which are no longer intelligent/fit enough to co-exist with humans and are rapidly going extinct.  When it comes to evolutionary theory, it has always been my experience that people don't realize that the fitness of a species is heavily dependent on the environment in which it exists.  Putting things in terms of intelligence may make this concept easier to grasp.   	This book covers a wide range of topics from the smart, but slow intelligence of the evolutionary process, the genetic learning and problem solving bacterial colonies display, and the speedy intelligence of the vertebrate brain.  Vertosick's goal is to explain all of this to someone with little background in biology or computer science, and he doesn't do too terribly at it.  He does brush over some of the more complex topics, and spends much to long on some simple ones in my opinion, but this is probably to be expected in a book with an uncertain audience, and such a wide scope.  Over all, I would say that this book would be better off if boiled down into three or four 30 page papers, but it isn't too bad.

      So I got called into the advertising department today where one of our two MACs was refusing to boot because it had a bad zip disk in the zip drive.  It would start to load up its GUI thing, and then just freeze there.  The advertising guy was about ready to throw it out the window, so I intervened and started messing with it.  After trying the normal peaceful solutions I had to resort to violence and riped the front cover off.  There, just were it was supposed to be was the eject button!  I have long pondered why in God's holy name the Mac people hide the eject buttons, and I think I've finally figured it out.  See I think Steve Jobs has a problem with premature ejectulation, so they covered up all of the buttons in order to make him drag the little disk icon to the little garbage can.  PC users on the other hand are expected to have more self control and wait until the light goes off before ejecting.  In linux, things get even more complicated because you have to umount first... or at least you did before the new kernels and automount tools became available. (Note all obscene comments will be deleted.  This IS a family blog after all.  And this means you MIKE!)

       urlLink    This daemon hell beast wants your soul.... you have a big gun.  Can you really ask for more than this in a game?&nbsp; urlLink

      I was quite happy to read that the Mozilla Foundation (of  urlLink Firefox  fame) is putting a  urlLink $500 bounty  on serious bugs in their software.  Unlike a lot of software companies (Microsoft for instance) who try to keep security problems hidden from the general public, Mozilla is taking a much more progressive stance by making their development and bug resolution processes transparent.  By doing this they ensure that all of their users are aware of security problems should they arise, and that fixes are promptly created.  In contrast, many of Microsoft's security problems are kept quiet and only known about by Microsoft and malicious hackers for disturbingly long periods of time.   urlLink Here  is an interesting article about these two approaches.  Amazingly it was published by ZDnet, a group which is usually pretty pro Microsoft, but in this article they very much support a transparent, full disclosure approach. In other news, Doom3 comes out tomorrow.  It is already floating around  urlLink in certain channels .  We can expect to see a serious decrease in productivity from IT people for the next few weeks.  This game is HIGHLY anticipated (and pretty much guaranteed to scare you witless).

       urlLink    This is a high-speed shot (hence the blur) of the horse cantering.  Cantering is tons of fun but a bit scary because it feels like the horse is suddenly going quite a lot faster.  It is much less painful than trotting however, and getting from the trotting stage to the cantering one can be a big relief.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    In this picture you can see how the horses two diagonal legs are doing the same thing.  Apparently this means that the horse is trotting.  Trotting is the least comfortable option in my opinion.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Okay, going from slowest to fastest, here are some action shots.  In this one, the horse is walking (the most comfortable speed, but kinda slow).  If you go to  urlLink this page  you can see the differences in each gait type.  It is quite interesting to me that horses have these different gaits, very much like a car has different gears, if only the shifting up part was a bit easier, and the shifting down part didn't happen automatically....&nbsp; urlLink
