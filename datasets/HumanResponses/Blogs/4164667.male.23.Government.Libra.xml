      What a day, full of emotional roller-coasters!  In the morning, i was so anxious and nervous to take the test, i felt as though i went back to the past, to the time when i was taking my Polytechnic exams.....  Waiting for the testers to check ur identity and and waiting for ur turn to take the bike test was like, how can i describe the emotion,........ oh yeah..... have u seen a husband waiting outside the operation theatre, waiting for his baby to pop out of his mum's womb into the living world... the baby might come out in minutes or might take hours and hours.... imagine the husband waiting for hours and not sure when the baby will come out..... that's the same type of emotion that i was feeling........ WHEN WILL IT BE MY TURN??????  finally it was my turn..... what do u know, my fav bike is the bike i will use for the test... bike 110... the bike i have been using for all my lessons and revisions..... will never forget how that even without throttling, it moves just by releasing its clutch, how u got to hit its gear shift hard to change from 2nd gear to 1st gear.... but for all its faults, its a wonderful bike, yamaha xjr.  during the test, i received no immediate failures, although there were instances that i thought i would nearly get some, but *escape*....... hehe..... the test went all right, no sweat..... now back to waiting again.... for the other riders to finish and for the testers to release the results.  around 12noon, the testers came to call out the numbers of the failures, my number is 60......."...56,57,58,59, 61..." Phew, my number was not called, at last my heart can start beating at a normal speed then..... *down boy down*.......  now back to waiting again, 1st to collect my refund from the CDC and a very long wait to get my license updated to reflect my class 2A. but what the heck, i passed didnt i, it was worth the wait.... hehehe...  Look at me World........... I passed, and never will i step into a driving centre for motorbike lessons again......... "HeeHaw"....

      Saturday, 14 Aug  Finally, the day has come.... me and devi will be spending a whole day togather at the beach.  We met at lavender Mrt station and took a bus to the beach.... had our breakfast at Macdonald's and took a walk to the bicycle shop to rent ourselves a bicycle....... i was hoping that she will be willing to try the double seater.... but unfortunately, she took a single seater and i had to follow her lead.....  We rode our cycles to a quiet spot near the Sea sports club..... enjoying the sea breeze n looking at the ships on the horizon. we whiled our time away, chatting n just playing around..... soon it was time to return the cycles, in fact just 25mins. we took 30 minutes to cycle to our current spot... we had to hurry....  We were sprinting in the cycles to meet the time........ in fact we reached with 10mintues to spare..... that was bad, the next day.... devi had knee cramps and i felt so bad in asking her to come cycling, now she is in pain....... "I am such an ass".......  Anyway, we walked back to the Macdonald and had a drink and fries to quench our thirst and hunger........ When i went to buy the fries... it took some time for them to prepare but during the wait, i was looking back at her.... and saw her playing with her drink and it was so cute...  After our drink, we walked back to the bus-stop and took a bus to the mrt station... we were actually suppose to separate down there, she taking a train back to her home and me a bus back to home..... but i just didnt feel like letting her go... and when she asked me to follow her, jokingly of course, i took that chance and went with her to jurong east.....  In the train, for the 1st time in public, she hugged my hands and laid her head on my shoulders....... *thud thud* times hundreds....... that's the speed my heart was racing.... i felt so happy..... is this what people call love....... hehehe  But really, i really felt as though i lost a limb when she had to go and take her bus back home at jurong east interchange....... y do i miss her so....... i just meet her 1 week ago in the IRC.... this is only the 3rd time i am meeting her.... *weird*....... so much emotions being thrown out on such short notice....... i need to see a pyschologist........ just can hope that all this is what they call love... maybe this is what romeo and juliet felt when they first met.... If so, hopefully, i will never ever lose this feeling because it is one heck of a great emotion to feel....... an emotion that can carry u to the heights of the starry skys above or to the depths of the sea below.....

      Friday the 13th Aug........  We are supposed to go to the Sri Mariamman temple at South Bridge rd for prayers.... As usual, i was waiting for her at her workplace. Previously in the day, she mentioned that her colleagues had said that her punjabi suit was very grand and pretty... i was very eager to look at her.......  after 5 minutes of waiting, she came and she looked gorgeous in her blue punjabi suit and sliver trinkets that she wore. my heart just melted at her sight..... so beautiful..... yesterday, she wore casual and today, in a more traditional clothes.... which is better?... it's like asking a person, which hand do u prefer, right or left?... of course he will say both right.  we walked to bugis for a drink and we just talked about everything and anything under the sun, where the topic lead us, we went...... time passed so quickly and it was time to go to the temple, her parents and aunt will there to meet her....... i was just tagging along to pray and at the same time to have a glimsp of her family....  in the bus, she started to wrap her arms around mine and sat very close to me....... my heart was racing and i started to sweat in my palms........ nervous, anxious, shocked, surprised, delighted.. which one was i feeling... not any one emotions but a combination of all, i guess....  we got down at chinatown to walk to the temple..... remember the dare we had yesterday, about both of us have to kiss each other.... well she reminded me abt it........ we were very close to the temple, of course i cant do it in the templ, right..... so i brought her to an alley nearby.... i cant lose 2 dares in 2 days, it will be an insult to my manhood.... i tried to kiss her.... she put up a mini struggle... as i was just looking out whether anyone was looking, she suddenly gave a peck on my cheek.... *9th cloud, here i come*..... and she came close enough to allow me to give her a kiss on her cheek.  Then we separated to go into the temple, dont want her family to see us togather... i went off to pray....  Then i saw her bring a gal along with her.... must have been her cuz sister... trying to show me to her. I tried to get a glimsp of them too, but the temple was too crowded.... *damn*.... i did my prayers and it was getting abit too crowded for me, so i made my way back home....  Will be seeing her tommorrow.......going to a fun day.....hehehe

      Today, after much chatting for the past few days, we met. I went to her workplace to pick her up........ i couldnt find her.... she said she was waiting at the bus stop..... she was not there or so I thought.... Then I saw this gal, with her hair let down, carrying a black bag waiting at the bus stop... is it her... nah... cant be..... must be someone else....... so i just decided to hang around the bus stop... waiting for her to show up, or to make herself known.  A few minutes later, i noticed that the same gal, was actually waiting for someone, her eyes were roaming, scanning the crowd for whoever she was waiting for. i had a glimpse of her side profile....... could it be her.. could be... i picked up some courage and approached her..... "Hi, Is ur name Devi?"..... what kind of a pick-up line is that??........ luckily, she smiled and said "Senthil?" ...."Yes!".. Glad i found her and was much relieved as well... she looked just like her picture in friendster, much better i would say..... her figure was awesome..... Her smile would melt an iceberg....  We had a short walk to bugis junction, making small talk along the way..... at one point, i exclaimed that the walk is actually quite short... she replied "That's because we are actually talking to each other, that we dont notice the distance" .... my heart melted. We walked around bugis junction, and finally we descended upon a starbucks cafe, got ourselves drinks and a table, to boot. we talked, abt everything and anything, abt how she havoc-ed in sec sch, about how i got canning in pri 6 for not doing my tamil homeworks.... and yet how both of us managed to do quite well in our exams.... hehehe..... maybe we are born scholars... is just that we are too lazy to employ our brains in scholarly manner..... hehehe. we talked about how, both our dads punished us, only once in our lives, when both of us were in primary 6. It seems she knew how to read my hands and tell my fortunes....... she said that i didnt believe in spirituality untill recently in my life and how i would have 2 wives.... *chuckle*.... well it depends on fate, i guess.  Time went by very fast and time came for her to leave.... had a curfew....Damn... so i brought her to the mrt station and she took her leave...*sigh*... Meet u again tommorrow......  u know, before our date, we had a dare among ourselves........ i am supposed to whisk her up and give her a kiss on her cheeks, when we meet. I didnt.... as it was too crowded wherever we went..... so i lost the bet....... for that when we meet on sat, she told me that she will dunk me in the sea in east coast park....... to which i responded, "If i go in, i will bring u in with me"... now that has become another dare...*wink wink*..... will keep u posted on who wins the next dare.... *chuckle*

      Well, today was a very gd, i would say....  1stly, i signed the document that will make me a teacher and a civil service employee in a month's time..... a stable job, a stable income with good increments, and a sponsored education, what more can i ask for...  2ndly, got a temp job for 2wks at Singapore Science Centre, will be involved with the National Robotics Competition. Going to tedious and a tough act, but it sure is going to be fun.... working with my old colleagues and friends for the 2 wks...  3rdly, Devi will  be meeting me on tommorrw(thurs) and fri, before our so-called official meeting on sat.... yah-hoooo..... it is going to be fun and exciting..... Not only that, during our chatting on Msn this afternoon, she called me "Athaan", which an affectionate term that wives call their husbands, or a term that a gal uses to address her prospective husband....... i ws so shocked but delighted to hear her call me using that term.....  I really have to say, this day has been pretty good to me..... "God Is Great"

      U know the gal, i was talking about, she feels the same thing abt me as i do of her.... Praise the lord.  My heart is just racing right this moment, and it doesnt seem to be in the mood of slowing down.  During the last chat, i was trying to kind of getting her opinion on whether i should tell the gal i like, that i love her... she was advising me that i should.... at that time i didnt know that she kinda of knew it was her that i was talking abt.... after a few minutes later i broke it to her.....  Today, she is telling me that she knew, i was talking abt her....... and that she had the same feeling of long-lost attachment to me as i did for her..... isnt that amazin....... its like the fate has meant us for each other..... soul mates and lovers........

      U know, its abit funny.... u wonder around looking for the one true love... but how many of us can truly say that they have found their one true love, their soulmate? Well i met this gal during IRC..... it was after a year of not chatting, when i finally ended up at the IRC page... channel Singapoeindians... just chatting with the ladies in the channel.... no bad i had to admit, the gals are not like the ones last yr... more daring and willing to chat with others. Thats when i saw her....name's Devi... nick was Jurong-gal. Dont know why and how, but i felt attracted to her....  Chatted with her... found out abit more abt her.... nice gal.... going to see her this sat..... hopefully everything will go alright.... damn nervous...

      well what can i say, its national day, Happy 39th Birthday Singapore...  the parade was very good at the national stadium, with its miltary precision and the 3 "acts" by the PA, Soka and the various schools involved. One thing that is worth mentioning is the wonderful fireworks which lasted throughout the parade and especially the one at the finale. it is worth an encore.  today is as usual a public holiday in singapore. what i did, as usual was just "Slacko Jacko". watch some movies, tv programmes and slept the afternoon away.anyway i was so bored at one point that,i was just surfing the internet. that was when i saw an internet article posted in singaporeindians.com about gals who dig guys who are exciting, adventurous and who are confident in themselves. there is no need to assimilate others so that u can be in the groove. be yourself and be confident of urself. Dont just sit there and think about it, get out of the chair, and do something. Its up to u....... who do u want to be........ a slacker with no friends ir an adventurous person who lives his life to the fullest.....
