       Jamie Murchie  of Lamlash took the 2004 Ayrshire Boys Match Play Title at Prestwick Golf Club on Saturday evening with a display of excellent golf giving him a 4 & 3 victory over  Michael Stewart  of Troon Welbeck, Murchie returning figures of three under par when the match concluded on the 15th green.  Stewart made the first move with a superb 40 foot put for a birdie two at the second hole, but Murchie squared the game at the fourth when a par gave him the hole after Stewart had bunkered his tee shot.  Murchie took the lead for the first time at the 5th when he holed from 20 feet for a birdie two, and Stewart narrowly failed from a similar distance. Murchie extended his lead to 2 holes after an excellent approach shot at the 7th to 8 feet set up a birdie three.  Murchie's only deviation from par or better in the front half came at the 9th when he overshot the green with his approach, finding sand. Stewart took full advantage, getting up and down from the front of the green for par, to reduce the deficit to one hole at the turn. Both players excelled over the outward half, Stewart recording level par figures of 35 with Murchie 1 better on 34.  Both players coped admirably with long first putts at the 10th to half the hole in par, but Murchie restored his two hole advantage with a regulation 3 at 11 when Stewart could only manage a bogey 4 after being bunkered on the left from the tee.  At the 513 yard par 5 12th hole, both players hit good drives but Murchie excelled with his second, drilling an iron into the heart of the green and holing from 15 feet for an eagle 3 and a three hole lead in the match.  An impressive regulation par at the 13th increased Murchie's lead to 4 holes, after Stewart missed the green with his approach, but Stewart continued to battle on, taking the 14th with par, to reduce the defecit to three holes, after Murchie took three to get down from the edge of the green.  At the 15th, Stewart pulled his tee shot left, and required a penalty drop. Despite his troubles, Stewart battled to the end, but Murchie's excellent approach to 10 feet, coupled with a missed putt prompted a concession from Stewart and Murchie took the title with a 4 & 3 victory.  Prizes were presented to both finalists at the conclusion of play by Prestwick Golf Club Captain Eugene O'Donoghue.

      The semi finals of the Ayrshire Boys Match Play at Prestwick tonight were both closely contested affairs, with the two matches finishing at the 19th and 18th holes respectively.  In the first semi final, between  Craig Mclaughlin (Largs)  and  Jamie Murchie (Lamlash),  the lead was never more than one hole throughout. Murchie was one ahead after 6, but when he found sand from the tee at 7, McLaughlin squared the match with a solid par. Murchie restired his lead with a par at 11, after McLaughlin bunkered his tee shot, but mClaughlin squared the match again at 13 with a solid par after Murchie fauled to get up an down from the left of the green.  McLaughlin went one ahead at 15, par being enough after Murchie found sand from the tee. Despite bunkering his tee shot at 16, Mclaughlin played a good recovery from the back of the green to half in par 4. At 17, Murchie had a superb two putt from the rear of the green for par, and despite a fine approach shot to 10 feet, McLaughlin narrowly failed to hole his birdie putt which would have given him the match.  Mclaughlin was still favourite with a one hole lead at the last, but Murchie played an excellent approach shot to a few inches, giving him a birdie three and a halved match after McLaughlin narrowly failed with his birdie attempt.  At the 19th hole, McLaughlin followed Murchie's good tee shot by putting his on the railway. Despite this, Mclaughlin played the hole well with his second ball, narrowly missing his put for a five, which left Murchie with two putts from 15 feet to take the match at the first extra hole.  In the second semi final 14 year old  Michael Stewart (Troon Welbeck)  faced the defending champion  Nicky Sinclair (Kilmarnock Barassie).  Sinclair won the first hole after Stewart found trouble from the tee but Stewart squared the match by the 6th. Sinclair had restored his one hole advantage through 10, but a birdie 4 at the 12th gave Stewart the hole and squared the match once again. Sinclair's lead was restored once again at 15, Stewart finding an unplayable lie from the tee requiring a penalty drop, whilst Sinclair posted a solid par to take the hole.  A par at the 16th was enough for Stewart to square the match once again, after Sinclair three putted, and at the 17th Stewart produced his best approach shot of the day, his second coming to rest some 8 feet from the pin. Sinclair missed the green on the right, and despite a good approach chip, was unable do do better than a bogey 5, leaving Stewart two putts for a one hole lead, which he duly took.  At the final hole, Stewart's drive pulled up a mere 5 yards from the green, and despite his best efforts, Sinclair could only match Stewart's par 4, giving Stewart a one hole victory and a place in the final.   FINAL - 1600 hrs on Saturday 14 August at Prestwick Golf CLub    Jamie Murchie  (Lamlash) Vs.  Michael Stewart  (Troon Welbeck)

      Tommy McInally (Loudoun) retained the Ayrshire Champion Of Champions Trophy at Royal Troon tonight after a final against John Sloan (Doon Valley) which went all the way to the final green, McInally going ahaed for the first time in the match for a one hole victory.  Sloan started very well, taking the opening two holes for a lead which he maintained through the turn. McInally however rallied and managed to square the match at the 14th hole. A half at 15 was followed by some excellent recovery play on 16 by McInally, who managed a par 5 to half the hole,despite being in two bunkers. Afurther halved hole at 17 left the players all square at the 18th tee.  Sloan's drive to the right was some 40 yards behind McInally's from the tee, but the Doon Valley plaayer knocked in a good approach to 20'. McInally however produced the shot of the night, a well struck chip which came to rest some 18 inches from the cup. Sloan's effort for a three just missed, leaving McInally a simple three and the 2004 title of Champion Of Champions.

      Defending champion  Tommy McInally (Loudoun)  remains on course for a second successive title after the semi finals of the Champion Of Champions were played over Royal Troon on Friday.  In the first semi final, McInally faced  Jamie McCormack of Ayr Dalmilling.  McInally laid the foundation of his semi final win over the first nine, turning for home with a 4 hole lead. McInally maintained his 4 hole advantage for the remained of the match running out a 4 &amp; 3 winner to gain a place in the final.  In the second semi final,  Graham Johnston of Royal Troon  faced  John Sloan from Doon Valley . Sloan held a 2 hole lead at the turn and extended the lead to dormie 3. Johnston however was not easily beaten, taking successive holes to take the tie to the last. At the final hole, Sloan drove into the bunker on the right, which had ended Greg Normans hopes in the 1989 Open Championship, and was only able to chip out sideways. Sloan then produced one of the shots of the day, laying his third some 6 feet from the pin. Johnston, in good position from the tee, pulled his second into the left greenside bunker. With a difficult stance, Johnston failed to extracate his ball from the hazard and subsequently conceded, giving Sloan a 2 hole victory.  Tommy McInally and John Sloan will now meet in the final, again at Royal Troon, next friday, 13th August with a 5.00 p.m. tee off.

      Finalists enjoyed perfect conditions on Friday evening when the 5 Club Championship finals at St. Cuthbert were played.  In the  JUNIOR FINAL   James Tarrant , recent winner in the St. Cuthbert Boys Open, faced  Blair Caddis . Caddis got off to a flying start, taking the first with a birdie 3, but Tarrant fought back to gain a two hole advantage at the turn, covering the first half in level par, despite a double bogey at the final hole of the half. Tarrant maintained his lead through 12 and finished off the match with a chip in at the 16th for a 3 & 2 win.  In the  LADIES BRONZE  final, Defending champion  Maureen Paterson  faced Past Captain  Judith Pettigrew . An early lead by Pettigrew was countered by Paterson who reached the turn with a 1 hole advantage, with some very effective recovery play around the greens. In the inward half, paterson steadily took control, and wins at 13 and 14 set up an eventual win for Maureen Paterson by 4 &amp; 3, giving her a hat trick of titles following last years win and her innaugural success in 1994.  The  GENTS DIVISION 2  final was a closely contested affair between  Jim Smith  and  Tom Houston , whos son Jamie had taken the Gents Championship for the first time 12 months earlier. Tom Houston won the first, but in what was to be an all too familiar pattern, Jim Smith squared the match at the third. The following holes were exchanged before Houston went two ahead, winning 6 & 7. Smith however fought back again, winning successive holes to square the match at the turn. Houston restored his lead winning 11,12 &amp; 13, but Smith again pegged him back reducijng the deficit to one hole at the last. A solid par 5 by Smith left Houston with work to do, but despite being in two bunkers, Houston bravely holed from 10 feet for par to take the title by 1 hole.  The  LADIES CHAMPIONSHIP  was between  Catherine Malcolm , bidding for her 17th win in 19 years, and last seasons beaten finalist  Marie Whyte . Despite some fine golf, Whyte had no answer to Malcolm who built a 5 hole lead after 8. The lead was extended to 6 holes at the 10th when Malcolm drove the green at the 245 yard par 4 before holing her put for an eagle 2. Despite being well behind, Whyte continued to battle, reducing the defecit by winning the 12th before Malcolm closed out the match by 7 & 5 at the following hole.  The  GENTS CHAMPIONSHIP  saw  Ian Rankine  making his first final appearance, against  David Glass  who was bidding for his 8th success in the event since 1987. A birdie 4 at the third gave Glass an early lead but Rankine squared the match at the next hole. The match remained tight through the turn, Glass holding a 1 hole lead after 9. Glas however took control of the match , winning successive holes from 12 to 14 to set up an eventual victory by 4 &amp; 3.

      In League 4, St. Meddans, runners up 12 months ago, failed in their bid to snatch the semi final place from defending champions Ballochmyle, when they could only manage a 3 - 3 draw in their final match at Belleisle. This left both  Ballochmyle and St. Meddans on 18 points, with Ballochmyle progressing to the semi finals by virtue of a better tie difference (+13 to +6).  In League 3, Ravenspark signed off with a 4.5 - 1.5 win at Moorpark to lead the section, with only the Kilbirnie Vs. Moorpark fixture, scheduled for Sunday 8 August, to be completed. With Ravenspark on 12 points (+7), Kilbirnie require at least a 4 - 2 win in thier final match to have a chance of progressing to the last four.  With Troon Welbeck and Irvine already through from their sections, the draw for the semi finals is:  Irvine Vs. Troon Welbeck (to be played by 16 August) Troon Welbeck Vs. Irvine (tTo be played by 30 August)  Ravenspark or Kilbirnie Vs. Ballochmyle (to be played by 21 August) Ballochmyle Vs. Kilbirnie or Ravenspark (to be played by 6 September)

      Mrs. Anne. Dootson, Lady Captain of Prestwick St. Cuthbert Golf Club in 1957 celebrated her 100th birthday during Open Championship week, on Saturday 17th July. Both Anne and her late husband Will were enthusiastic members of St. Cuthbert for many years and indeed Will was made an Honorary Member in recognition of his services to the club. Anne and her husband gave the Queens Silver Jubilee Salvers to St. Cuthbert in 1977, for a mixed foursomes competition, and it was appropriate that the last trophy Anne won at the club before she moved south was The Queens Silver Jubilee Salvers in 1991............1 round of stroke play and 4 rounds of match play...............no mean feat at 87 years old !!!.  Now residing with family in Cheshire, where she moved to from Prestwick 4 years ago, she enjoyed a party on the day of her birthday, numbering friends, family and the local mayor amongst the 100 guests. Anne's birthday was marked by Peter Alliss with not one but two mentions during the BBC broadcasts from the Open Championship at Royal Troon.
