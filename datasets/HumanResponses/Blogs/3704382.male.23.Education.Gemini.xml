      Hmmmmmmmmm,             Was really busy in my office today. Waisay, sometimes i think that Allah Taa laah nain kiyoon attraction rakhii girls boys main. Waisay, one thing is for sure interest between boys and girls is natural but to control oneself is the test.  Khair, Allah Taa Laah test main kamyaab rehnain kii taufiq farwaa aiiy. Falling in love is natural but i have observed that love between people who fall in love after marriage last long. Cuz, that love accepts all the right and wrong angles of a person and both accept eachother with it. Waisay, i agree that many of the times girls have to compromise as men have made their rules like they are written on a rock. But you know what i have observed that intelligent khawateen know how to tackle their husband. One should have understanding of other's behaviour. Cuz, nothing is gonna change his love for her all he says is in flow of some problems or emotions and when the water setlles he realize what he has been saying and everything becomes crystal clear for him.This whole process requires eachother's attention and people who get engage marriaged has curiousity that what is the nature of other person and have a life time to understand eachother. Waisay, hamaray religion main loving somebody is not seen as a bad thing but what i have understood is that it says if you like someone you send your message in her family and if they allow you get married. That is how i have heard all the marriages of Saahabaah.  SO, as far i have understood our religion says whatever you do, do it till its completion means, the extreme of loving someone is to agree to live with him or her till end of life time. Our religion doesn't appreciate the views now-a-days people have keh nazroon hii nazroon main they can even tell the size. Aray bhai, agar yeh piyaar hay tou i must ask keh what is lust then? So, i believe in it as well keh whomeever i would love i would make her my wife. Waisay, i said when this event arrives the attitude i have i m not sure keh koi bhii ladki would like to continue the relationship with me. Cuz, i don't allow people to try to figure out what i am I think only people close to me has this right( by people i mean girls ;) ).  Whenever any girl smiles at me or shows some guesture even if she is not thinking like that i instruct myself keh bach bachay bach. Cuz, i know girls are really sensitive about theses matters and the relationship that starts from simple plain talk usually ends up in keh she will even take you to resturant as well if you tackle her right. Hey don't take the word tackle in wrong way. So, the more any girl try to come near to me the more i get the irritation. I would love to love someone who is just mine not like someone ( not everyone ) now-a-days keh fall in love in just one look and try to pursaude the person through looks or old time tridition like to cook something for ya or to call you every night or something like this. People get practical i know there are condition when someone can really love some one but if you have been told that few of all these candies in the bowl are poisoned will ya take one out of it. So, this is my condition i am facing and i have seen many cases when a girl and boy start loving eachother and after few days you see them they are like east and west meant, have started seperate lives. I don't believe in any such kind of love bhai, whenever somebody approach me i just think keh yaar, if i reject she would definitely be trying somewhere else. I know some people will think keh yeh ladkii tou chaloo hay yaaar. Sorry for this vulgur word but my friends things are that simple here. Now, hear my next theory behind any girl its the man's role in constructing her ways of going through directly or indirectly. If she is trying to approach it is not always negative she is just trying to get a husband people a protective place in this society. I don't mind the purpose but don't like the way it has been done. You know what If a good developer develops some piece of code he knows the pitfalls of that piece of code. In the same way, Allah has created us and He knows whats good for us. So, instead of giving up everything and start searching for a boy or a girl is stupidity. Whoever is written in your life will get to you. It merely upto you which way you choose, cuz, in both the condition you will get to one and only point. ;) so, what is needed is to Ask from Allah in Dua tou make the other partner baaaiseh Rehmat for this world's life and for life after death. Cuz, only Maqbool Dua can change your fate. And i always have good Gumaan from Allah Taa Allah.  Okz. guys written alot of stuff now.  Got to go Allah-Hafiz.  Hmmm, by the way all these things that i have writen above are random thoughts so, don't mind if i repeat a single statement   multiple times.  Allah-Hafiz.

      Well, in the lunch break she tried to come and sit with me but i steped back from her and showed as if i had to go to do some work. I have blocked her on my msn list as well. Cuz, i think 2 much doze would be fatal for her. Khair, now you people must be thinking that who she is? Let me give you a quick overview of her. She works in my office for last 1 year. After an year she has started showing her interest in me. Khair, u know me i always do my researh. So, i added her in my msn list. She is really jolly person and is quite open and has a big mouth. Along with all this she is a real confident person. Niether she nor i have told her that i like her. You people must be thinking that just liking? why not love ? Hey you people i donn't believe in love before Marriage you know. I believe and is my experience as well that a man can do real love with his wife and same goes with wife. All other promises and stuff are nothing but stupidity cuz, it has no solid background they are always hiding and doing everything with the fear that nobody get to know. Khair, back to the topic. I don't want her to get some idea before even something has started. This is my experience that most of girls i met they got serious in me. I don't know may be my personality ;) or the way i talk. Whatever it is i don't want it to happen to her. By the way i forgot to tell you people this time i have the equally equiped opponent as she knows how to talk as well. So, i think this way things would be interesting in few days. I am feeling sleepy now. See ya guys. Allah-Hafiz.

      Well, today was a tiring day and i had a lot of work. Well, i liked and respected girls since i was in schools you must be thinking that what a hunk started to look for girls since that age. Then my brother the point is i always used to think alot and got to the point that i need someone whome i can share my all feelings without fearing that the other person would tell everybody else or would blackmail me ...etc. So, my journey started since i was in high school i still remember that girl. I still don't know her name.By cutting the story short,i saw few girls standing on the window of the first floor facing me. You know what i was and am very shy and don't usually start first. I saw a girl out of those smilling and passing looks. Well, it was the first time for me. haa haa yeah my friends same old crap came into my mind keh yaaar, yeh tou line maaar rahi hay. I still remember how stupid i was at that time ( I know many of you will say 'still you are' :) ) The very next day i bought a yellow marker and write on the paper saying 'I LOV U' and started waiting for her very keenly she came by the window after 20 minutes and i showed it to her and she smilled back to me. Ufffffff! it was like a volcano had dispersed inside my body, yeah, i know it is very typical but i thought i have fallen in love. ;). Well, that was the moment of life time. In those days there was hit song on MCC   Nadya keh sang kinaray  Chandaa keh sang hain taray  Koi nahien hay tanhaan mairay siwaaa   ;) i remember listening to it alot. haaa haa haa.   On the weekend i thought about her that is she my dream girl, the girl that i adore and want her more than any thing in my life? In few minutes my logic asked me as an input that does she smile at others as well? To answer this question i replayed all the events in my mind and found keh yaaar, this radio set catches all the channels. Aray baaap reh, I thanked Allah keh He saved me from this mistake. Aur wooh aik week end kaa Love kaa Fever was gone on the weekend. Although i still have to pass from her house sometimes but i never tried to go back there.  :)  On that day i asked my self what is LOVE yaaaar?  How do we know we are in love?  What are the symptoms of love?  Does love exist or not?   Oohhhhhhh My! i really forgot that i have to meet the deadline in the office tommorow.  Till tommorow Bye.
