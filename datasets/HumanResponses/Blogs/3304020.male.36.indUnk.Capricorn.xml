      Aren't you disturbed by the recent election results? Where is our country heading? All those leaders who promoted development are rejected by the Indian Janata. Take Atalbihari, Chandrababu, SM Krishna... All of them lost elections against the expectations.  Does this mean we as a country are against modernization? Against real positive development? What do we the people of India want?  It appears that most of us want ultra secured government jobs, assured returns from farming... People blame the governments for the famine. People blame the government for reducing unproductive jobs in PSUs. Everyone wants subsidy. No one wants to know who pays for the subsidy. They feeel it is the reach who pay for the subsidies. That is wrong. everyone else pays for it. What if we remove subsidies?  One of our problems is a huge population for such a small piece of land. China has more no of people but they have more land too. In terms of population & its density we are at the top. I read somewhere that the our farming is economical only if the familes are large. More the no. of people in family less are the wages you pay to the farm labor. Our market systems are also not favourable for the farmers. No where in the industry you pay some one for buying your product. It happens only in India. E.g. if you buy car in Chennai which is produced in Gurgaon, you pay for the transport. In agriculture if you sell your wheat from Punjab in Chennai, the trader will deduct the transport price from the farmers bill. And in some cases if market collapses by the time the product reaches market, the farmers have to pay the difference instead of getting paid for it.  This scenario can be changed by improving the infrastructure. We need better roads, we need better communications infrastructure. We need more data in "our languages" reaching the people. This will keep the farmers well informed and they will get better rates for their produce. But then we are rejecting people who are doing this. We have visionaries to give us vision. But the people for whom this vision works are not fully aware of it. The local small time politicians are busy working on the cast based voting. They are dividing the country.  The media is also at fault for many a things. They projected all these leaders as some one above the ordinary and seperated them from the public. They sold this image to the people. But what media forgot to tell people was the extent of work done by these leaders and significance of that work in times to come. Common man never understood the imortance of this and voted for others.  BJP projected a positive image of India and it started working on the people. More and more people became proud of being an Indian. This is start of building a nation. Today people who take pride in their nationality are Americans. Whereever they go they project themseleves as superior to rest of the world and they try to prove it by their work as well. The effect of BJP's campaign was just the same.  Congress on the other hand started on negative note. It has been in power for most of the time and they still want to project that the country is still poor and people do not have work. Although that is reality why not look at it positively? We always say India is a huge country and all our problems are also huge. This is just running away from the problem. If we have a huge problem we have huge work force also available in the country to solve that problem.  The only mistake I feel done by BJP is that they said India Shining and not India Rising. Also the Feel Good caption helped in projecting that we have reached the top. Raymonds is one of the best cloth in the world, they can say feel good. We as a nation are not at that level yet.  My opinion *India Rising* caption could have worked wonders for BJP. That is a more realistic picture. What do you say?

      This was the first movie I saw in the series. Movie starts with Harry being insulted by his relatives and commenting about his parents. Harry leaves the house in anger and in the dark night when he is sitting on the pavement he sees a black wolf coming out of the bushes. Harry is scared and does not know what to do and then the movie goes full throttle with a double decker bus sent by the ministry to pick him up. The bus journey is an amazing one. It drops Harry at the minister's office. On the way Harry comes to know that some prisoner from Azkaban has fled from the prison. Minister tells Harry that his life is in danger. In the train to school of magic Harry comes across some terrifying creatures called Demetrius. Prof Lupin rescues Harry from their attack. Things move on and finally the Prisoner and Harry meet face to face. What happens next...? Go watch the movie for it. The movie is full of all sorts of unusual things happening. None of routine stuff is normal. You will find candles floating in the air, books which bark like dogs, staircases floating in the air and connecting to each other, pictures which are more like movie and all the characters in them talking to the characters in movies. You have an animal which is combination of an eagle and a horse, scary Demetrius lot of such things. However the movie lacks emotions in the story. There are few shots between Harry and Prof. with some emotions, where they talk about the past but that theme is so reused that it does not make and impact in the end. The story is about Harry discovering his powers, conflict between the positive and negative but in the movie the core elements of the story are somehow lost in all the special effects. Almost all the actors have performed well. But Harry is not the best of them. His girl friend steals the show.  Rating: Worth a watch although not a must. But definitely not on a TV. Go pay the theaterwala. Kids will enjoy it.  That brings us to the next movie Hum Tum. Are gals better than guys or is it the other way round? Saif portrays the character of a guy who false for any beautiful lady. Saif and Rani meet on a flight from Mumbai to New York. Saif is a cartoonist and has a popular comic strip called Hum Tum in his name. Theme of the cartoons is the age old debate of sexes. During their halt at Amsterdam they roam around the city. Both of them like each other but to stop Rani's bakbak Saif kisses her and that makes her go wild at him. She bids good bye to him, but he hopes one day they will meet. And they do. And they meet again. Back in India when they meet again, Saif's mom (Rati Agnihotri) asks him to help manage a marriage, which is her profession. Saif meets Rani only to find it that she is getting married. After few years Saif is in Paris to meet is father, played by Rishi Kapoor. During his visit he meets Rani once again. But she looks completely different. A mature lady, all the girlish bak bak is gone. Saif tries to find out her whereabouts but she does not encourage it. Later He finds that her husband (Abhishek in guest appearance) died in an accident. She has moved to Paris in an attempt to run away from the crowed and is running a boutique of her own. She does not want anyone’s sympathy. Rishi Kapoor helps them to develop friendship again and he also develops a soft corner for Rani. Rishi is a photographer and due to personal ego problems both he and Rati do not see each other. Saif tries to bring them together but has not been successful yet. Few months later Rani comes to India with her mom (Kiron Kher). Saif being a good friend ties to find a nice guy for her as he is sure no one would like their daughter to marry a guy like him. However his attempt to get Rani married is disclosed and Rani is furious at him. They fight with each other only to find that they are in love with each other. But the question is who will say it first? What happens next is pretty much predictable but little different (hatke) from the normal Hindi movies. All in all an enjoyable movie and all credit goes to Saif. He has carried the movie well on his able shoulders. He has good sense and timing for comedy and he is not bad in emotional scenes as well. The character he plays is similar to what he played in Dil Chahta Hai and he now looks like getting more such roles. Rani is not at her best although her fans may like her. But this role could have been done better by Preity or had it been earlier days this movie would have done wonders with Shahrukh and Juhi or Kajol playing the lead role. Songs are OK. Only the title song is better of the lot. Do not buy the entire album. Kiron Kher is as usual good. Rati Agnihotri and Abhishek do not have much to do, although Abhishek tries to look cute guy and succeeds to quite some extent. Rishi Kapoor also has a limited role in this movie but he is one actor who with his terrific sense of timing, dialog delivery and expression makes a solid impact. You just can’t forget him. However he needs to control his figure. All the stuff he could not eat for so many years seem to be marching towards him and he is not able to resist it. He is becoming a typical Senior Kapoor. All round and pink.  All in all Hum Tum is a movie worth watching with your spouse. You will enjoy it more that way.
