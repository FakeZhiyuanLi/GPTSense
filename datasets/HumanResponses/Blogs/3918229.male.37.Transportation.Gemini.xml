      So, I ask you...why do we build up so much drama in our lives?  Thursday is the day I've been dreading for the past two weeks.  Why, you ask?  Every six months or so our team (the gals in the office and me) have a outing (not the kind where they point fingers and judge me but rather the kind where we get the heck out of the office and do something fun).  As you can imagine, trying to coordinate something that will please everyone is nearly impossible.  I try to come up with some ideas that I think would be fun and different than we've done in the past and then we vote on what sounds best...Of course, I ultimately decide "what's best for the team."  I really thought I outdid myself this year by suggesting we do one of the following events:  Spending the afternoon at the horse track in one of suites Hiring a hot air balloon to cart us around the city Going to a race park where we can chase each other around in go-karts                                    Then I decided to mix it up a bit and throw in a couple of boring ones just for variety.  They were:  Have a barbeque Go to a pottery class and paint dishes that we could take home Go to a movie  Of course, the entire time I know that one of my fantastic ideas is going to win "the vote."  My personal preference was to go to hot air ballooning.  So, we took this vote and to my amazement they all chose the backyard barbeque.  I guess you can never predict what women will do.  So, we've determined it's a barbeque.  Oh boy, that will be fun at the height of hottest time of the day in the Texas heat.  Did I mention that it's supposed to be 100 degrees tomorrow?  Ah, good times.  So, where do we have this shin-dig?  I'm hoping for a park or somewhere cool so I can use my new picnic basket (complete with all the "stuff") that someone bought me last Christmas.  However, against my better judgement they talked me into having it at my house.  Let the bitching begin.  Most folks live at the opposite end of town than we do and with Dallas traffic it always takes a long time to get anywhere so I'm sure they'll complain about the journey.  Plus, I live about 25-30 minutes from the office and that's without traffic.    Now, keep in mind I keep the house pretty clean but have been sprucing it up a bit over the last day or so.  These women love to pick up decorating tips, so I want everything to look like we actually don't live in the house.  After all, I have a reputation to keep up.  After having you read two paragraphs about this I've suddenly decided it was a big ol' waste of time even writing about it.  Let's chalk it up to "just trying to fill the space."  I'll end that topic with I'm not looking forward to it and the best I can hope for is that nobody steals anything from our house.  The beau and I watched t.v. most of last evening.  We try to stay busy and do at least something every night...run an errand, hang out in the backyard, etc.  But like I was telling you, it's way too hot here so when we got home we took off our work clothes and hung out in the darkest room in the house in our boxers watching t.v.  We didn't even open the garage door and take a dip in the pool.  All in all, it was a nice night.    That's it for now.  Until Then,  FLYguy04

      Well, here I go....my first journal entry if you will....I'm not sure exactly what I'm supposed to write for all of the world to see so let me know if it needs a little "sprucing" up and I'll try to kick it up a notch.  So, here's the deal...I'm 37 (just had a birthday) and living in the suburbs of Dallas with my beau...yes, that's right....I'm a boy and so is he...crazy, huh?      We're living the all-american dream complete with a sedan, suv, dog & a cat.  Since I could go on forever with background information I won't bore you with the details...The abbreviated version is:  * I'm shacking up with another man and have been for over six  years. * I have a full time job which includes health insurance and free pop. * I work in the aviation industry but I keep my feet planted firmly on the ground   Currently, I'm sitting here at work exhausted from writing evaluations all day long.  I've decided to treat myself to a moment of relaxation.  I work in an office with all women (eight of them) and I'm the only guy.  These women are great but as you can imagine at times it can be a little much.  Plus, these gals are messier than any guy I've known.  I can't believe all the trash they leave all over.  If it's not coke cans scattered all over the place, or candy wrappers floating about, it's food left out on the table for extended periods.  The health department would be writing fines left and right if they knew about it.  Oh yeah, here's something for you to think about....It's HOT here...I mean really hot here....so, the beau and I got this smart idea to build a pool even though we don't have the yard to support it as our house is on a zero lot line; however, after a couple of cocktails one night and a trip to Target we bought a 13 x 15 inflatable pool and set it up in our garage...classy huh?  So, now whenever we're in the mood for a dip in the pool, we open the garage door, turn on the filter in the pool, turn on the cd player and open a bottle of wine for an afternoon of fun and frolic.  It will be interesting to see the neighbor's reaction.  Did I mention that we live in a "good" neighborhood where we have a home owners association who will fine you if they don't like the color of your door?  Really.  So, don't tell anyone about the pool, okay?   Now, I just need to figure out how to hang a disco ball from the garage door opener.  Like I said, classy.    For now, FLY GUY 04
