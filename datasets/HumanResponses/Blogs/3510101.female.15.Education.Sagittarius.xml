And ummm...footsteps.  Okay it was just my mom.  Well I have had a nice week, I bought new shoes, and new charms for my charm braclet, it's not an italian charm one, it's the good old fashion one.  My charm of choice is four buttons hanging on links.  It's a cool bracletand I am still bored. Well by now I am coming to the realization that umm..no one comes to my blog, I am just writing and writing to thin air.  And believe me the air is thin, have you heard of the Greenhouse effect?  Lol. Okay well anywho.  I have had a nice week, I got the new SWITCHFOOT CD!! YAY!! And today I could go to Jasper's Birthday party, or go to DOt's hmmm....choices.  Well the other day, or last night for that matter, I made another website, it's pretty cool. Well I am feeling tired of typing.  I don't think that last sentence made sence, but that's okay cause I am sleep deprived.  Well hope you all have a peachy keen day! ADIOS! Asta pasta, adn leave comments or sign my guestbook on my actual website!  BUBYE!

O and by the way, everyone has to go to Christina Ventura's Quincenera!!! It will be so much fun!! I know it will.  Well I would like to take this time to say I am very very bored.  And I want to know why no one! Looks at my blog, or my website.  I have 225 hits, and NO ONE BUT MY FRIENDS SIGN MY GUESTBOOK, OR COMMENT ON MY WEBSITE!!!  That's just not nice!! I would go to everyone elses website if they had one! I do, I go to everyone's website who asks me to go, and no one has even looked at my message board!!! That's so messed up!! Well fine, I will just go and not come on to the internet and answer everyones messages!! HA!  How do you like that!! Alisha will not be here anymore to write your annoying little novels!! And I wont be here to rebut someones idiodic comment. Well BUBYE, o before I go I would like to make my own Best ... Like in the year book.  THey have Best Hair, Best Personality, Best Smile, Best Dressed. WOW, someone just looked at my site, that's weird, cause well I am making this message.  Well hello Shady.  hehe.

      What I am doing is typing with one hand to a couple friends.  And typing here, well today is June 2nd.  And well I am eating.  I am very bored, and the news just ain't that riveting tonight.  Well let's see what happened today?  Uhhhh.....O I know!!! zzzzzzzzi got my yearbook!!! Go CUHS!!! As of tomorrow @ 1:45 (or whenever the bell rings) I Alisha, will be a Sophomore!!!!  Really really sad that school is over wonder if everyone can just come back tomorrow just for me?!? Well guess we'll never know.  Well I am now a two handed-betty now.  And I would just like to say to all the SENIORS who go to my BLOG, "You made it!!! Hopefully.  I will tell all seniors everywhere exactly what I told my friend.  "It's your last day as a senior, so what's a man to do?  Start your life dough-head! That's what.  Well just wanted to congradulate you and hope you start your life with someone fun."  Well for girls, you may need to tweak it, but everyone gets it.  Right?  Okay well I would just like to say that I am truly going to miss all the senior that I know that are leaving.  Hope your life is as wonderful as graduation day, cause that's the best day of your life!  Well sort of.  Besides your wedding day, and birth of your first child, and stuff like that.  But in school days ways, that's the big one.  You'll more then likely cut off contact with your "friends" and that'll be a good thing in the sense that you can meet tons of new people.  Well I promised Dot I wouldn't write anymore novels, so well that's it for now.  BUBYE.   P.S. Cheese is not good with peanut butter cookies.   Adios!

      Okay so only two days left!!! Yup TWO days till CUHS graduation, and till schools over!!! Can you believe it, the next time I go to school on a Monday, or Tuesday, I will be a Sophomore!!! OMG!! I can't believe it!! Okay well, I have to go, I am being kicked off the computer in like ten min.   P.S. If anyone is having a party in the summer tell me a week before hand, so I can schedule it.  I cannot garentee I will go unless I have a weeks notice, and even then, I am not positive.  Okay well as of today, these are the birthday's I have: Elaine's @ Waterworks (date will probably be changed) June 12. Jessica's @ Marco's (date unknown)  Hannah's @ ?
