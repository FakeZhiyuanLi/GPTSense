        One of the greatest books I've ever read, Johnny Voodoo. I love to read, but sometimes I get sick of reading and I won't read for awhile. . . . .  &nbsp;  Here is a short little bit from Johnny Voodoo:  &nbsp;   "Did you ever just stop liking someone? I mean just wake up and there's nothing?"     &nbsp;   "Like when the pain's so bad you can't stand to feel it? Like you love them like crazy, love them, trust them, they're your whole world, and then- bam- they go and do something that hurts you so bad&nbsp;that you push it all down and you can't believe how numb you feel? Like you got an ice cube sealed up around your heart? Nah, never experienced it."     &nbsp;   "When does it stop?"     &nbsp;   "Who says it does?". . . . .     &nbsp;   . . . But in my head there's an answer: They may never come back, the one I loved and the one I almost loved, but they'll live forever inside my heart.     &nbsp;  It's books like these that make me want to read everything. You have to fish out the good books, the ones that aren't really known among all the big and mighty ones we've all heard of. Those are the kinds of books I like to read, the quiet ones,&nbsp;life changing&nbsp;books that you'll remember forever.  &nbsp;  ~~~~~~Seria

       I guess I'm going to get my own P.O. Box, groovy. . . So I bought some Etnies last night, hot pink and black. I'm listening to Cake at the moment, go figure lol. . I haven't written anything else for the zine yet. .&nbsp; Sunday got her new Bright Eyes cd and I guess she's been writing like crazy or something. . I've been playing my bass a lot lately, my favorite song to play is Only in Dreams by Weezer. Eventually I'm going to play She'll come Back to Me by Cake, I love that song.     &nbsp;   There are a lot of cd's coming out that I'd like to get: Sugarcult, Cake's new one, Green Day's new one, Beastie Boys, Steriogram, Weezer, and the list just goes on and on lol.&nbsp; Well dudes, I gotta go. Later.     &nbsp;   ~~~~Seria

       I now have a P.O. Box, YaY! Turns out my friend Lizzy has a one, so I'll just use hers, Yay. I'll let you all know when the first issue is done. E-mail me if your interested and I'll send you my address, I'd rather not post it on the interweb. I'm not positive this will stay, but for now it's a dollar an issue, trades are groovy too!     &nbsp;  ~~~~Seria

        So I tried to get a P.O. Box today, but had some cough* difficulties. I'm going to have to talk to Sunday and figure something out.&nbsp; O.K, I'm 14 and you have to be 18 to set up a P.O. Box which really sucks! I might have my brother (Cody) set up a P.O. Box for me. . . hmm that might work. Oh well I'll figure something out.        &nbsp;   ~~~~Seria

        When I write something&nbsp; by myself, it's good but it could be better. When Sunday writes by herself, same result. Soo we decided to try a little joint writing and this is how it turned out.        &nbsp;    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Ambivalent Pain        &nbsp;    He stares with anger in his eyes      His voice dark like tinted glass      He looks away from me      Planning a way for me to forget Him      He's reaching in      Breaking my heart      Then Leaving me alone to bleed      How shall I repay him?      The fist gift He gave me was heartfelt pain        &nbsp;    I will not give up on Him      I still have faith      He will never rid of me      Though He tries      I see it in His eyes      Every day as I pass Him by        &nbsp;    And this hate I feel      I love so much      It gives me reason to pursue my plan      My plot to have Him once more as mine      And this hate I feel      Yet love so much      Will be gone like leaves whispering in the wind.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Poem by Seria Something and Sunday Love.        &nbsp;    I like it a lot. I think it's the best thing either one of us has ever written. I think it will be in the zine, YaY!        &nbsp;    Sunday doesn't get on the interweb much, but I'm trying to get her on so you can "see" a bit of her as well. For now I must dash ( ha ha no one says dash anymore lol ). Later dudes.        &nbsp;    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Seria Something

        So this is my first blog. Kind of interesitng I guess. I'm just trying to get a little advertisement for my zine that is coming out soon. The first issue still isn't quite done with only 7 pages, but I'm very excited about it. Sunday and I have some poems, but mainly I think it's just a personal zine, YaY.     Later dudes.       &nbsp;  ~ ~~Seria Something

        Ahh! It's hard to keep up with all the stuff I've got on the interweb.  As it turns out, I am going to get my own P.O. Box. I just have to pay for it, YAY.  Nothing really new. I've written a couple more poems lately. The zine is almost done, lol how long have I been saying that one? Sunday has written a poem and I'm pretty sure she's going to put it in the zine. I helped her write the ending. I hate it when I hit a spot in a poem where I have no idea how to continue. I got a zine the other day called the Riverside Art Scene. It was OK, but I'm not going to order another copy from them. The dude is kind of against everything from the government and such. I also ordered another copy of The Moonlight Chronichles, YAY. I might send in our zine to Fish With Legs to be reviewed. . .           Later dudes.     ~~Seria.
