      I got home at 4:30 am last night.  What a day...  Working was NOT fun, lemme tell you.  My feet are sooooo blistered from dancing.  I hurt.

      Geez, that last post was pretty harsh.  I'm not really racist at all, I was just in a bad mood.  But I shouldn't have taken it out on the Chinese.  What did they ever do to hurt anyone?  I apologize to the entire race.  Except the dumbasses running the space program...  I had the first meeting of my sci-fi bookclub last night.  We're going to do  Destination: Void  by Frank Herbert.  The only problem is it's out of print and I think it's going to be super hard to find.  It's not even in the public library.  I think we might have to change it.  The guys seemed nice though.  Sash, one of the members, wants to have sci-fi movie nights as well.  I think that's a great idea, as I don't have anyone to go nerd it up with me when I want to get my sci-fi fix.  And there's a few old classics that I haven't seen before, and now I have people to see them with!  Yay!  Maybe I can convince then to watch  Day of the Triffids  with me.  I've been wanting to see that for ages.  Peaceaightone.

      ...Space program.  It's ass, seriously.  I remember when they were all like, "Yeah, we totary go to da moon, chief."  But now they're more like, "We buird useress space station, why not!"  Don't they know the error of their ways?

      Apparently the name of my blog is also directly ripped off from a  Futurama  episode.  It's the one where Fry eats a toilet sandwich and becomes infested with those regenerative, smart worms.  In the worm's main outpost there's a statue of Fry with the inscription "The Known Universe".

      Yeah, I've had that phrase stuck in my head the whole day.  Ugh.  Anyway, even though no one reads this yet, I've decided to explain the name.  I ripped it from a collection of Larry Niven books.  They're not cohesive enough to be called a series, but they're all set in the same universe.  The collection is called "Known Space"...  I have yet to ask this question to others of the nurd persuasion, but I will pose it to you, oh blog: Were you able to reside in a sci-fi universe of your choice, what would it be?  Oh, and none of that faggy fantasy shit.  Dragons and wizards are lame.  My first choice by far right now, and for the last while, has been Larry Niven's universe,  Known Space .  Transfer booths provide near-instantaneous transport, boosterspice lengthens the normal lifespan to about 400 years, space travel to other stars is old hat, and such a thing as Ringworld exists. Space travel isn't so formal as in  Star Trek , where you pretty much have to be in the Federation to get anywhere.  And it's not as sketchy as  Star Wars , with the Empire brainwashing its soldiers and the Rebels fighting for every inch.  Asimov's  Robots of Dawn  universe paints a very bleak future for Earth, despite the 'success' of the many colonies.  And Bradbury's futures are always so sad.  Those poor Martians... Niven's universe is just a very human place.  The first colony is named "WeMadeIt", which is hilarious.  The colony with the one huge mountain protruding from the surface is called "Mount LookItThat"..  like fuck!  It's awesome.  So well developed.  So...  that's enough nurd for now.
