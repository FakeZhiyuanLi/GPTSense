      Some friends and I went to Yellow, it was pretty cool ..that DJ Ko Kimura was playing that night and it was kinda crowded. I didn't have much energy since I went to a house party so I had to leave home really early ( I didn't even go to the gym !).. we danced for a while ...drank a lot ... talked a lot ... it is really fun when you go out with friends and you can sit down for a while to talk ..complain about your life ... tell and hear news ..gossip... specially gossip! Damn .. K has so much energy!!!!!!! she said she didn't like house but ...wow ... she danced a lot!! One of the good things about that night it was that I could practice my Jap a lot .. I still suck though! Other good thing: I didn't fall on the floor so I don't have any purple marks beside the ones I already have .. V is a really nice new friend, he reminds me another good friend ... I mean how he used to be some years ago.. Well, we all had FUN that night! PS: Daaaaarling K, I'm gonna exercise a lot to beat you on the dance floor next time :-)

      I'm pretty lazy to take my fat ass to the gym but once I get there, I just don't want to leave !!! Maybe it is because they have so many mirrors and every time I look at them I realize I am fat and need to work out ... shit... I used that tanning machine today but I still look the same white whale .. I gotta go every day until Sat because I got a CUTE orange dress for the wedding !! YEAH !!! and a golden bag and golden high-heels !! I'm happy ... so futile ... hehe...

      Fuck !! I had to stay outside for 1 hour ( it's 3:30am ), because the damn siren rang again ...probably because that damn bitch was using her damn drier AGAIN ! It's pretty scary, picture this : you are almost naked in your house ( it's hot! ) when the siren starts to ring .. you think it is FIRE and you have to take the most important things ( cell phone,wallet and cigarettes ) and run through the stairs ( 9 damn floors! ) ...okay .. I admit I took the elevator this time because last time I had to take the stairs and it was nothing ..not a good excuse though .. anyway ... I walked around the building to see if it was fire then I called the security company AGAIN ( I called them last time too! ) and the guy told me to call the fire department if I see smoke !!!! Damn ! ( I kinda like this word.. )It took the guy 1 hour to get here and the place was already full of police ... Thanks God it wasn't fire or I would have to sleep outside and I am not wearing a bra ! I'm gonna call the security company tomorrow and complain about it ! .. not about my bra but about the driers :-) I wanted to have one really bad but we don't have space in our apartment so .. why my neighbors can have one ??? YES, I'm egoist ! Well ... I met 2 neighbors tonite and one girl just happen to live right below me .. ohhhhhh ... she lives in the apartment where we always "accidentally" drop things in her balcony .. I gotta be careful from now on ..

      I took a Xenadrine pill 7 hours ago and I can't sleep now ( it's 2am! ) .. I'm having a pretty busy day tomorrow and I should wake up early but I think I will sleep early .. early in the morning ! I have to buy a dress, I mentioned before that I was going to wait until I lose more weight but it is turning a mission impossible this diet thing ... I eating correctly almost all the time and I going to the gym every day but .. I gaining weight !! I breath too deep and my lungs retain too much air every time I weight myself ..that's the only explanation ! at least it doesn't hurt too much ...   Dear K just called 30 minutes ago ( I know a lot of people whose name begin with K but since I don't want to write names here ... let's just describe her : she is Brazilian , I used to work with her and we call each other Daaaaaarling ,that's cute huh ?)..anyway .. she lost her last train and is going to hang out somewhere until morning ,I wish I could go out too but the trains stopped a few hours ago ( that's what happen in a big city like I live ..)we are planning to go out tomorrow ,I already had plans to go to Yellow so we can all have a great time together !! I always have fun with her, she is one of my favorite friends and an extraordinary person !! I gotta give this thing address to her too .... hehe...

      Fire-works season is coming .. Yeahhh ! I think I am living in Japan too long .. I love Hanabi, any kind of Matsuri ( even the ones where the Jap guys have to carry that big thing wearing only diapers .. those white asses are gross ! )and those tends where they sell all kind of food .. sometimes they look disgusting..but who cares ??   I gotta buy a yukata this year .. I remember when I had to wear that thing some years ago for the first time and it was sooooooo hot! We took pictures of everybody wearing yukata and jimbei ( did I spell it right ? ), I looked like those ghosts that appears in photos behind people ... I am always in a bad mood ( means : with a horrible face ), specially when I am hot and sobber .. like that day .. BUT after that we went clubbing and I think I drank a lot and had fun because I don't remember anything after I got to Pure ...

Oh sacred gin tonic , your devotee is praying for you ! Ahhh .. there are times that the exercises block my mind full of pizzas images , Yummi threw away my discounts tickets !!!  rrrr..   I tried some dresses for dear K wedding today, I decided to wait one more week to buy it since I am too fucking fat ! I look like a pregnant and I am too white and I have all those bruises from Muse .. did someone spank me while I was too drunk ?????? Gin tonic is possessing my mind again .... hunnn ...    The world is so cruel ... why there are just a few fat people in this world ??? Should I try to get all the people around me fat then I can look skinny ? ginnnn tooooonic power !

      Yes, I'm still doing my Body for Life thing. Yes, I'm still going to the gym ( didn't go today due to the typhoon , it is a good reason not to go out right ? ) Yes, I still want to eat my whole L size pizza but Yummi threw away all my discounts coupons ! Yes, I still don't know where I wanna work or what I wanna study. Yes, I'm still smoking and drinking ( I have bruises in my body from Muse ... it was because I fell on the floor and couldn't stand up ? Alcohol is evil !!! ... but I still like it )  My whole body hurts today , I played tennis yesterday for the first time in my life .. it is more difficult than it looks like ... or it is because I suck ? Can I say I suck after play it just once ? hunnn... even though my neck is red like a shrimp and itching, I think I'm gonna look for a school , after all it is a good exercise ... painful but efficient ! Why is my fat belly still there ?????

      I didn't have inspiration to write here in the past few days ..means that:I didn't have "saco",literally "balls" in English. I wonder when/why this expression in Portuguese started,balls :patience ? Anyway.. I was reading part of a book about diet in 12 weeks and it showed pictures of fat people ,the before and after thing , you know ,fat before and damn sexy after the diet ,those pictures that make us think they just cut the fat people's head and put in another body... then I decided to give it a try ..means that : I am eating all the things I can today and tomorrow and I am going to start the diet/exercises from Monday ! It reminds me that I only have 5 days to work in that sucky place, will I miss it ? ......... nah !!! Going back to the diet/exercise thing ,I used to go to the gym everyday when I was in Brazil,it's easy when you only have to study and have plenty of time..that's not a excuse because I know I am f*** lazy.. So I decided to write all the results here , means all the painful things I am doing... that's why the title Bridget Jones's Diary but it's not a really good title since she started fat and ended up fat !

      I was coming back home today and I started thinking about when I was in Brazil. I don't know why but I can't remember many things ,just some images coming up like flashes ,a slide show.. someone said once that when we don't want to have some things in our minds ,they get erased automatically after a while.. I think this is what happens to me. Which is not always good because there are some things that doesn't seem good at a determined point but after a while they become good memories. I am from Registro ( Sao Paulo), a small city in the middle of nowhere known for bananas... yeah baby .. bananas ! and for tea due to the large Japanese comunity in the area ,they say that when the first ship from Japan went to Brazil ,a guy hid the tea .. seeds?leaves? damn! let's say just tea..well he hid it inside a bread because it was illegal to take such thing to Brazil.. I wonder if a marijuana seedling would pass through.. going back to the tea guy , he just happened to chose my small city to start his business.This whole thing made me wonder how the banana story started......... hihi I don't want to write an autobiography so I better stop here my Brazil thing, eventually I will write more things about this topic.

      I was supposed to be working right now .. but so many thoughts are disturbing and blocking the working side of my brain ,this state of complete numbness is called "vagabundagem" in my native language Portuguese .I've been feeling this way often lately ( too many cigarettes and lack of Hachiko ? ).. I still have 8 days and 3 hours to work in this sucky office, not that it is too bad to work here but sometimes I feel like I lost good part of my life for nothing .. okay.. there were good things too like ... (5 minutes later ) damn! I'm trying to remember but nothing comes up... hunn.. I have a good diversity of colorful pens in my drawer and I have time to write my blog . Humans , we are such a complicated thing at the same time so simple. I'm getting blue.. I want to think about things that make me happy ,I think everyone should have a list of things that make them happy and carry it everywhere. Let me see : brownies with vanilla ice-cream while I watch cartoons,interesting books inside the train ,dogs and cats (too bad I can't have them right now),feeling dizzy,my Yummi touching my nose,feet massage after a long walking,fat people ( it makes me look thin),dancing,imagining a bright future..imagination in general! I better go back to"work" now.. shit !

      Ecstasy  Turning round I see, surprised, a large, round, living temple. I am here, part of it all, I am part of it all. I look at the world and the world looks back at me. I am not alone. This is Ecstasy.  Standing, I feel. So tender and being held so tenderly. My sadness is like a soft bud velvet and moist, my tear a dew drop trembling on the tip of my nose. I am so happy to feel. This is Ecstasy  We sing, we laugh, we share and most of all, we care. We let each other see the beauty inside without shame or anxiety. We're happy and free. This is Ecstasy.

      I'm still impressed about the destruction of the world thing ( thanks to the movie ) ... I'm in my dinner room..looking outside .. the sea .. the colorful sky .. fat lady jogging .. and I just realized there are so many things I want to do in my life and I might have to leave most of them to do in my next life... It's good to think that all the sorrow and pain I felt and that I will still feel,will make of me a better person when I come to this place again , I just can't stand the idea of living like this during the eternity in the supposed heaven ( one whole life like me is more than enough ! ). The time is passing so fucking fast .. it was like yesterday I was with my friends sitting in the sidewalk of my small and boring city ( Registro )talking about what we would be when we grow up.. Damn !! I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up ! But I have a feeling that everything is gonna change in the next few years ...

      I just watched this movie today , I read some bad critics about it but I decided to check it out ... for personal and politics reasons I really like it ... just in a movie I would be able to see Americans trying to enter Mexico illegaly and an American president saying thank you to the people from "once said" third world for their hospitality  .. okay .. I don't want to be mean ,It's just what I think ... well I don't have much time right now so I'm just leaving this : nothing is really right in life , just death ... i remembered this when I was watching the movie and thought it is totally right..

      because I just came back from the gym .. yes I said GYM ... I've been going every day&nbsp;since ..last Sunday ! hehe ... hopefully I will keep going every day untill I have a decent body..&nbsp; well .. I wanted to write more often but every time I get home, writing here is the last thing I think about doing...&nbsp; Ky just called me ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... after an hour ... my body hurts ... my body really hurts ... it is good, isn't it? whatever ... I should have started working with Japanese people before... they are so polite ...so patience ... I wrote this before but they surprise me every day .. the first good thing about working there is that I don't need to worry about going to the toilet and meet that fucking fat cow looking at me with that ugly face (last job thing) ... all my co workers used to live in another country, they told me to talk to them in English that they are going to reply in Japanese..that way everybody can practice something .. my Japanese is still weird but they still want me to answer the phone... that is one bad thing about this job ... I mean bad because I can't understand everything but it is good too cos then I can practice Japanese.... I wonder if one day I will learn it, I am living here for 11 years and I am not fluent&nbsp;.. maybe I have mental problems ... I falled too many times from the stairs when I was a kid ...

      Since I am in a bad mood I want to talk about sucky things ..things that drive me crazy..&nbsp;  1-there is a special place for smokers in restaurants, we can't walk on some streets while we are smoking and we can't smoke inside trains. I totatlly agree with all these things because other people don't have to smell cigarettes and blah blah .. THEN I think they should have special areas inside trains, restaurants and people with kids shouldn't be allowed in shops just like we can't get in with dogs and cats.. REASON: the parents seems to be used to children CRYING ,CRYING AND YELLING and they don't even care when other people are almost&nbsp;having a heart attack ! I know I am being a BITCH but that's is how I feel every time I am on the train going to work and trying to "relax"and a kid is just CRYING AND CRYING with all his strength for no reason.. we can't use cell phones on the train because we can disturb people but what about yelling???  2-old ladies that don't shut up in the train...they talk talk talk talk about shit and are very loud and rude too .. one day I was on the train standing in front of an old lady and she was going to get out so I was waiting to sit down because I was in front of her but the bitch just called a men ( he was in his forties and she didn't even knew him) and told him to sit in her place after she gets out of the train because she didn't want me to sit there because I was young and young people shouldn't sit on the trains!  3-guys in clubs that thinks girls like to be touched in the ass by strangers... last week I was taking my bag from the locker and a guy who was sitting close just put his hand in my ass!&nbsp; so I told him : did you touch my ass ??? why did you touch my ass?? you have your own fucking ass to touch instead of touching mine ! drunk and pervert guys really sucks !  HAHAHA... I am writing shit .. and it just make my bad mood worse ... I suck too!

      I've been really stressed lately ... it's like I'm in a good mood then in a second I feel like killing someone..then right after that, I am completely normal... well..never been completely normal :-) Is it normal to be on pms every day ? I think my mind is really tired ..or how can I say? I feel like my mind is full .. I just wanted to stay away of people..vacation..be by myself..with nothing to think about..nothing to worry about..just rest... I was at home for 2 weeks after I quit my sucky job but I couldn't really rest since I was looking for jobs..I think I should have waited a little more before starting in this new place.. I just can't wait for a vacation ... even right now that I am just writing here.. It's hard to explain and I know it is even harder to understand but .. too many things in my mind .. sometimes I think I am listening to voices.. I am not crazy! I'm just... stressed! I can't stop smoking ..thinking about drinking.. the best feeling lately is when I am buzzed.. it's like all the things in mind ..all the thoughts are not "running " as usual and I don't feel like I am in labyrinth.

      drink gin tonic and smoke in my balcony looking at the sea... long nails when you have coceira (an irritating cutaneous sensation that produces a desire to scratch.. I decided to be more cultural&nbsp; :-) ... sleep inside the train without any sucky children screaming or fat people sleeping in your shoulder... listen to "Turn me on - Kevin Lyttle" inside clubs... finish work and being able to leave work earlier.. being able to sit down without having to open the panths ( I know this is nasty) ...use the tanning machine and have a nice tan without having to fry under the sun for hours...laying down&nbsp;on the sofa with the air-conditioning on and watch tv all day ( remote control power...which I don't have..shit) ...&nbsp;fire-works ( I&nbsp;watched fire works last Sunday in a park with 500.000 people, I was using my cute&nbsp;yukata&nbsp;and I didn't get in a bad mood just because that thing is hot like hell)... I'm sleepy.. I had to wake up at 5:30am to go to work..yawn ...

      ..since I wrote here last time ... I'm surprised but I think I ... I think I ... I like to work with Japanese people ! It can be really interesting.. I am learning&nbsp;a lot and my co-workers have patience to teach me Japanese... so if I don't learn Japanese this time.. I will be sure I have mental problems.. actually it's becoming an commun excuse.. I mean .. that person acts this way because he has problems.. he doing that because he has problems .. everybody has problems!! What I was talking about ? hunnn ... yeah.. the job is still kinda difficult but I am enjoying ;-) There's a fucking BABA on the B1 floor.. she is always complaining about something but I just look at her with my "I'm gaijin face" and she just give up to keep talking..&nbsp; There is a party next Fri in the building .. not a party party but some comedians are coming and the bank is gonna pay dinner and alcohol.. I'm not going because I think the comedy is gonna suck... I would rather go clubbing .. AGAIN! Wow .. after all D is not getting that old! K has just started a new job too so we are drinking a lot together..you know.. after a tough week of work, relaxing drinks !

      Anthophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of flowers. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize they face no threat from flowers. Any genus or species of flowers can instill fear, as can any flower part, such as a petal or stem.   "Anthophobia" is derived from the Greek "anthos" (flower) and "phobos" (fear).(from MedicineNet, medical dictionary)   PS: I just want to try to explain why I am afraid of flowers.. hummm .. even though I've tried to explain to some people and they laughed!  well ... flowers, plants in general are alive !!!!!!!! but they usually don't move... just stay there.. watching... the worst one is the sun-flower!!! it moves following the sun ... so it can move towards people! Ahhhhhhhh .... I give up!! I know you are laughing .....  rrrr

      What a week ! I had forgotten how it is to be the "new one" at work... after working 4.5 years in my last job, I'm the one who has to learn everything now... and there are so many things ! Sometimes I just want to leave the office and never go back but then I realize how lucky I am because they could have given the job to a Japanese person who doesn't have problems talking, reading and writing in Japanese but instead they gave me a chance and my co-workers are really kind, always teaching me how to do things, answer the phone properly, calling other departments, reading the documents, taking me to eat out ( I ate sushi at a really nice restaurant in Otemachi today! ),helping me to learn Japanese, etc ...   They treat me like an equal there .. I mean .. they could just say I don't have to do everything they do because I am "gaijin" but instead they help me to do some works that I never thought I would be able to .. It's being a really good experience ! If you ask me if it is difficult.. YEAH .. it's pretty difficult sometimes ... but good things never come that easy and after I get used to the work, I'm sure ... not so sure ..hehe.. I would enjoy the place :-)

      The Mitsubishi Bank building has 12 floors, the 9th floor is for eating, break time and smoke ( there's a restaurant and a combini! ) ... I work on the 6th ... it's huge .. the whole building is huge and there are sooo many people working there! so many tables and computers .. so many ugly people ! it's scary!!!  The first day at work was not bad but I realized I had a LOT of things to learn.. countries code for sending documents ( is it possible to memorize all the countries code in the world ????????) ... how to use their damn computer programs ... the names of all the departments I have to go everyday to pick up documents... they all sound the same .. I can only understand the end .. which is gyomu ..hahaha ... is doesn't help much ..hehe ... I have never worked only with Japanese people and talking only in Japanese and in my first time I see myself in the middle of a Japanese Bank which is super hyper consevative! I can't use "normal" clothes... I have to close all the bottons of my shirt.. no strong make-up ... colorful nail polish.. I'm a nun !!! haha.. Sister D from now on.. and another thing: I have to answer the department telephone... they all use that formal Japanese and sometimes I can't understand anything, I try to speak very loud then they can realize my Jap sucks but I finished my third day and I still have to answer phones..hunnnn .. shit! There are so many rules that sometimes I'm afraid to breath too deep and an alarm start ringing or something .. haha.. Does it sound a bad place to work ? hunnn ... sometimes I think so but ... it will be good for my Japanese since I'm being kinda forced to learn ( the manuals are all in Japanese too!) and a good experience ( Jap bank and stuff ) to put in my resume ... AND sometimes I am too tired ( my body is influenced by my mind ) to eat.. then .. in some months I won't look like a white whale anymore!

      Ohhh yeah ! I didn't write about my new job ... I'm gonna start it tomorrow... Mitsubishi Bank!! I still can't believe they gave me the job... I went to the interview because I had nothing to lose and in the same day, they called me and said I could start on Monday..tomorrow!! Hunn ... it's gonna be kinda difficult in the beginning because I will work only with Japanese and people might be really "katai"( I'm going to buy clothes for work today, I can only wear really formal clothes... this is gonna suck) but if I can stay there for a while, at least my Japanese is gonna be decent ! hehe... no pain no gain!

      Yesterday was K&B wedding!! It was sooooo beautiful! I was the maid of honor... can you believe ?? I got inside the church after the 2 brides maid and stood in the altar close to K and kept her bouquet during the ceremony ! okay... I am afraid of flowers so I didn't look at them ... it was a mental work... I kept my focus on the priest nose and totally forgot about the flowers.. it worked!   They had a really nice party afterwards.. lots of food, alcohol and presents for the guests! It was perfect!! They thought about every detail .. napkins with their names in it... everything just perfect!! And I am really happy for being able to be part of their wedding... I can just think about a word to describe yesterday .. PERFECT !

      I was going to work today when I remembered something I read in Angels and Demons ( Dan Brown ) ... I wrote here before, I mean .. I asked why God let some us suffer sometimes instead of helping us .. and in that book when a Swiss guard asked the camerlengo the same thing, the priest just answered him with a question.. I am not good at explaining things so it was something like this : if your son wants to skate board, would you let him do it even if you know that he might get hurt or would you let him do it, feel the pleasure of it and learn by his mistakes ?

      I was talking to Ky some days ago ...  about the thing I wrote here.. about destiny and how good it would be if we all knew what is going to happen and stuff ... we are always wondering why things happens this or that way ... she told me that everything that happens in our lives has a meaning and even if we don't know it right now, one day we will find it out because nothing remains without an answer .. she also told me the meaning of the bananas written by Paulo Coelho.. I am gonna write it in my way ... a guy met a monk and he ( the monk) was laughing by himself ..the guy asked him why and he said that he was happy cos he found out the meaning of the bananas ... he took a spoiled banana from his bag and said : this is a wasted life , it time has passed and now it is too late  ..so he threw it away ... then he took an unseasoned banana and said : this is the life that haven't happen yet, we need to wait for the right time ...he put the banana back in the bag ...finally he took a mature banana and started eating, saying this is the life in its better time, the present ...  eat it without fear and without guilt ... So ... I am trying to live today without thinking about future or past .. it is so fucking difficult but it is better...

      I started to read books again .. I haven't been reading for a while ... I forgot how good it is .. it is like .. I forget everything when I read ... that's why I like fiction better than non-fiction books or biographies... When I was young .. hunn .. I am still young so .. when I was YOUNGER I wanted to be a lawyer then I wanted to study marketing ... but now my dream is to be a writer when I grow up ;-) .. I might be wonderful to know that thousands of people are reading something that I wrote ... that they are imagining themselves doing the things like in the book ... that they discuss the things written there ... Writer ... I think it is the most difficult profession in the world ... I mean of course GOOD writers like Agatha Christie ( she is my idol !!!) ..I think I read almost all her books,most of them in Br so it is difficult to buy her books here since I am not sure if I have it in Br or not. She wrote 79 novels and she is outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare... isn't she great ?? well ..we have to think that Shakespeare started to write in 1594 ?? and people still buyhis books ...so .. in 400 years she might be 2nd on the list ..hehe .. am I talking shit ?? anyway .. I was writing that I would like to be a writer one day .. pretty difficult dream I can say ... not that I consider myself totally retarded but I am not the smartest person in the world either .. I am reading Angel and Demons by Dan Brown in the moment ... the guy is brilliant, he writes about art, history, physics, etc ... if I was going to write a book, what would I write about ? 1.000 ways to stay at home and do nothing ? how to eat a large pizza by yourself and stay alive ? D, biography of a vinegar drinker ? The refrigerator code ? ahh ... I am hungry and I have to go to the gym now ...

      I decided to make another blog .. secret one .. so why am I talking about it here ? hunn ... because I am stupid ... anyway ... I like to write .. and since I know some people read this thing from time to time I don't feel comfortable to write everything here .. sometimes we are not the way people think we are ... or the image we make of ourselves to the others .. not that we are lying but we would feel too vulnerable to show everything .. our deepest desires.. our past .. our secret plans for the future ... we don't want people to think we are weak ... I think that's it .

      Sometimes I think people can't understand me ...sometimes I think I don't understand people ...am I so different ? I really try not to lose control but ... things just ..get .. so ... messed up.... Sometimes I think : is this what I really want ? sometimes I am sure but other times .. I just want to disappear ... the hole on the ground thing again ... if destiny really exists .. I mean .. if we have all the things that are going to happen in our lives written somewhere, it wouldn't be much easier if we could just read it and wait for those things to happen ? maybe it would be boring but .. much easier ... some people believe that we are here now to pay for something we did in our other life ... but again, it wouldn't be so much easier if we knew what we have done before and just accept what it is happen in this life ? I watched that movie with Jim Carey where he plays God .. in the movie, God can hear all our prays and decide if he should help us or not ... I wonder if he can listen to me sometimes ... if he can ... why can't he help me ? When I was a kid I remember I always asked him the same thing ... in my prays...or when I was sad... it was always happiness ... Maybe we have a certain amount of happiness in our lives ... I mean there is a limit ...that's why we never live in total happiness or we are going to use everything too fast .. I miss my dogs ... I always liked to talked to them .. they didn't judge me ... just look at me and I felt that they could understand me and I didn't have to worry about what they would think about me ... they just loved me no matter how much shit I was talking to them .. I am in my sad day today ...I wrote happy things ...crazy things ...stupid things ...angry things ... and very stupid things here too .... today is just this ... or it is just hormones problems ... THE END.

      We tried to get tickets for the game ( Real Madrid x Tokyo Verdy ) but since we were going to try to buy tickets in front of the stadium and we got there after the game started, it was kinda difficult ... I mean... we found 2 tickets but we needed 3 so .... we were there ... in front of the stadium .. we could hear the people inside having a good time .. we saw people getting there late with tickets ... they got there around the half time and they didn't want to sell the damn tickets!! Yummi and his friend were even on tv ..hehehehe ... they were trying to make some kids sell the tickets when the camera came and asked what it was going on ..one kid said that we were trying to buy the tickets and he said NO but we didn't leave him alone ...hahahahaha.. Yummi and his friend didn't understand what the gyus were saying and they were just waving ...making "peace" sign to the camera ..OF COURSE I wasn't there ... I was busy trying to find a hole on the ground to put my head ;-) anyway ...... then we went to the other entrance and they decided to get into the stadium ...yeah poor ME was with them when they tried to pass the security guy ..who couldn't understand English and since they showed their job ID ...he just let us in ... 2nd security guy : SAFE too !!... VOILA ! we were inside the VIP party for Real Madrid !! hahahahaha .... we saw the field ..some players ... until they got us ... poor ME was looking for another hole on the ground ... well ...after all ... it was not so humiliating ... but it would be funny to see Yummi on tv :-)
