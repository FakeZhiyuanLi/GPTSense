      So yesterday did not feel like a humpday, the first Wednesday in a while to actually not do so. Wednesdays, as it turns out, are also shaping up to be the regular visits with Dr. P., whose cognitive based therapy is a welcome addition at this point. (I had some pretty interesting conversations with my mom about Dr. P., or rather the need to visit Dr. P., and the stigma associated with seeking professional help. Something about can of worms, crazytalk, etc.) Case in point (or so it would appear to her): I talked to Dr. P. today about this idea that's shackled me for a while now, and we tracked it down to a couple of things: Catholicism, my grandfather's death and how that day was the best day I had ever spend with my dad growing up, and how these good and bad events were mashed together inside me to produce a really janked-up karmic explanation for the occurence of things. And I mean I know better than to parcel or simple things out as such: good followed by bad, or bad followed by more bad. But it's still a nagging gadfly to this day, that feeling, that idea that crikey! as soon as I'm aware of having a good day, something's going to come along and ruin it or check reality for me. Preposterous! exclaimed Dr. P. as he chugged on his pipe (or so, I gather, my mom imagines... and no I don't lie down on the couch, while I'm at it). I understand this, and it does help to talk it through with an impartial observer in the person of Dr. P. Still and all, it's pretty bizarre that after leaving the session and feeling pretty good for a change (work's going fairly well, life overall is going very well too), I come home and get a cold bucket shower. So I try not to dwell and not associate events as such (noticing birds chirping, followed by possible infidelity). Nah, not this time!

       "He married a Texas girl, I want you to know... A West Texas girl, just like me. We both married above ourselves, didn't we, Senator?"    -  George W. Bush  , referring to Senator Bill Frist (May 27, 2004)   I wish I would've been there (Me? Well, it wasn't a Republican fundraiser, so calm down y'all). You know I would've been that one person that they had to drag out for laughing my ass off and interrupting the speech.

      So I'm currently enjoying the Charlatans "Us and Us Only," a very underappreciated set of songs in my opinion. The band moved from being trendy to being something else, for sure, but trendy in and of itself gets old quickly too. The Tim Burgess of UAUO is a particularly engaging one, moreso than on earlier sets I think. But oh well.  Today the post's an afternoon quickie between things to do here at work. (Thing before: tweaking population estimate formulae. Thing after: solar cars and Lego robot kits.) Please kiddies don't crowd around; one of you'll have this job someday...  Things going well. Good quiet weekend. The homefront's fairly stable. The weather never ceases to amaze (rain in July??? Is this the end of the world?) Dealing with the pre-birthday dizzies (oh shit 26, 26, 26, 26, 26... and I still haven't bitchslapped any of the Bush twins). Well at least I can scratch some of those items off the Things To Do Before I'm 30 list:  (as of this morning) 29. (Re-)Learn how to drive stick-shifty (sorry about your truck, Abdiel) 37. Meet Rita Moreno 45. Cup some celebrity ass (thank you, Jeff. Thank you. Sigh.) 78. Invent my own dish involving eggs, to be eaten at any time of the day and with the optional use of Splenda and/or huitlacoche (the quite tastarrific Uovomos... say that sounds like a trendy eatery...) 92. Spit off the top of the Torre Latinoamericana (I'd actually never done this before; I've had this something in the past about spitting in public, much like I do grabbing my crotch in public... that one's #93, by the way)  Not too bad of a year, I'd say.

      Why in the world does shit like  urlLink this  not happen to me?  It's always the down-and-out, downtrodden, deserving ones whose lives get flipped through the sudden infusion of luck-induced millions. Don't get me wrong: I'm happy for old Geraldine and all, but c'mon now Hermes, I've scratched enough tickets and played my numbers faithfully. I'm not asking (outright) for $294 million: I don't want to have more dinero than most South American countries. Just enough to kick into high gear the work of my fledgling student aid foundation. And early retirement isn't such a bad thing, I hear. $10? Okay $5's good. A mate of mine mentioned once that we're all statistically going to get lucky only once, lottery-wise. That would suck, cos my luck came shortly after I turned 18, when I won $1,000 on a California scratch-off and quickly splurged it all on clothes that suit  urlLink Graham Norton  better than they ever did me.  So yeah, congratulations Geraldine. But if I may offer some advice there, old girl: take up Karate. You'll need it to defend yourself against the hordes of prying septuagenarian goldmilkers. Now, I know that nowadays anyone with a dollop of Trivial Pursuit-like intellect immediately thinks of Ralph Macchio's crane stance at the mere mention of the word Karate. But it's more than wipe on, wipe off! So much more! It is, I gather, a sure way to strengthen one's self-confidence and improve one's power of concentration while at the same time getting all lethal and shit with your body. Just a thought, Ger. Never too old, I say.  So remember... mae’r  urlLink Karate  ‘n anodd a egniol ond mae’n hwyl hefyd. Mae’n hwyl fawr i gyd!

      "He had challenged my integrity. And I didn't like that. But most of all I didn't like the fact that after he had done so, then he wanted to act like everything's peaches and cream. And I informed him of my view of his conduct in no uncertain terms. And, as I say, I felt better afterwards." -- Vice President Dick Cheney  And by "informing him of my view," the Shadow President meant, of course, to offer a euphemism for "fuck off." Yeah, I can see how it makes one feel better afterwards... cos by informing both him and the "Real" President of my views in November, I'll be telling them both to fuck off. Hell, they can pop a nut also. Or two. And yeah, it'll make me feel better afterwards. :-)  And now for the not-so-random yet slightly tangential passage:  From a  urlLink Slate  article, referencing Niall Ferguson (the Britempirologist) -  On the eve of independence for the colony of South Yemen, the last British governor hosted a dinner party attended by Denis Healey, then the minister for defense. Over the final sundown cocktail, as the flag was about to be lowered over the capital of Aden, the governor turned to Healey and said, "You know, Minister, I believe that in the long view of history, the British Empire will be remembered only for two things." What, Healey was interested to know, were these imperishable aspects? "The game of soccer. And the expression 'fuck off.' "  Bloody hell yeah. But okay, Completely Asinine Me says that I'd also add Jennifer Saunders, and anyone that knows me knows I'm not an AbFab whore. It's that, *shrugs* I'm just in love with her right now. That voice... It'll pass, I know this. Erm, um, on the other hand, Brow Furrowed Me would like to add to the list the lessons of empire for current and potential hegemonies so that the path to modernity can be less bloody, more sustainable, all the while flexible enough to include everyone's definition of modernity without the all-encompassing silver gleam and mass-market flavor. Vote?
