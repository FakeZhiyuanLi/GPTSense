      This Booty Call Contract (hereinafter referred to as the Contract) is entered into on the _____ day of __________, 2004, by _______________, between _____________ and ___________.  THIS CONTRACT SHALL COVER THE FOLLOWING RULES AND PRINCIPLES:  1. No sleeping over--unless it is very good and we need to repeat it in the morning. 2. No meeting in public except for dinner or drinks before the events of the evening. 3. No calls before 9 PM--we don't have shit to talk about. 4. None of that "lovemaking" shit--only mind-blowing sex allowed. 5. No emotional discussions-- Ex.: Where are we heading with this? Do you love me? The answer is no, so don't ask. 6. No plans made in advance--that is why you are called the "back-up," unless you are from out-of-town, then it's only a one-time, advanced-arrangement. 7. All gifts accepted--money is always good. 8. No baby talk--however, dirty talk is encouraged. 9. No asking for comparisons with former lovers--it's really none of your damn business. 10. No calling each other "friends with privileges"--we are not friends, just sex buddies. 11. Calling out the wrong name during sex is OK--don't be offended. 12. No extra clothing--I don't want your ass leaving anything behind when you leave. 13. No falling asleep right after sex--it's over, so get your ass up and go home. 14. Don't be offended if I don't ask if you enjoyed it--I don't care. 15. You cannot borrow my car for any reason. 16. If anyone asks who you are, the standard response will be: "My roommate's girlfriend/boyfriend." 17. Doggie style preferred--just hit it hard and right or get the hell out. 18. Reason for doggie style: the less eye contact the better. I don't want to look at you, just fuck you. 19. We hook up absolutely whenever the mood strikes ME--so don't keep calling.  *** EXTRA TIP FOR SUCCESSFUL BOOTY CALLS***  The aforementioned rules may be altered by the holder of the contract. If the other party attempts to change or alter any terms of this contract, it will automatically become null and void and you will then be removed from the BOOTY CALL LIST and deleted from phone memory and email list, BLOCKED from all communications until your silly ass understands the rules.  Participating partners: Signature: ______________________ Date:

      1. If you are over 30 and you have a washboard stomach, you're gay. It means you haven't sucked back enough beer with the boys and rather you've been sucking-off the boys and have spent the rest of your free time doing sit-ups, aerobics, and doing the Oprah diet.  2. If you have a cat, you are a Flaaaayming Fag. A cat is like a dog, but Gay: it grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch except when it uses its nails, and whines to be fed. And just think about how you call a dog..."Killer, come here! I said get your ass over here!" Now think about how you call a cat..."Bun-bun, come to daddy, snookums!" Jeeezus, you're the poster boy for GAY.  3. If you suck on lollipops, Ring-Pops, baby-dummies, boiled lollies or any such nonsense, rest assured, you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks stubbies, shots, bar-b-q ribs, crab-claws, raw oysters, cray-fish guts, pickled eggs, or titties. Anything else and you are in training to suck El-Dicko and undeniably a Fag.  4. If you refuse to have a shit in a public toilet or piss in a parking lot, you're in a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his toilet; he defecates and urinates where he pleases. A real man will shoot, shit, sleep where ever he likes.  5. If you drink decaf coffee with skim milk, you like a high hard one in the poop-chute. Coffee has to be had strong, black (or with thick, wholesome milk) and full-aroma. A pussy-eating man will never be heard ordering a "Decaf Cafe Latte with Skim or with a twist of lemon" and he will never, ever know what artificial sweetener tastes like. If you've had NutraSweet in your mouth, you've had a dick in there too.  6. If you know more than six names of colours or four different types of dessert, you might as well be handing out a free pass to your arse. A real man doesn't have memory space in his brain to remember all of that crap as well as all the names of all the players in the NFL, NBA, NHL and Nascar. If you can pick out chartreuse or you know what a "fresier" is, you're gay. And if you can name ANY type of textile other than denim, you are faggadocious!  7. If you drive with both hands on the wheel, forget it... you're hungry for man sausage. A man only puts both hands on the wheel to honk at slow-arse drivers or to cut the motherfucker off. The rest of the time he needs that hand to change the radio station, eat his hamburger, hold his beer, finger the bitch in the passenger seat (whoever she happens to be), or talk on his cell phone.  8. If you enjoy romantic comedies or French films, mon-frere, vous sonnez le Gay, oui? The only time it is acceptable to watch one of those is with a woman who knows how to reward her man. Watching any of the above films by yourself or with another man is likely to result in SHC (spontaneous homosexual combustion), which is what happens to fags when they flame out too quickly. So follow the rules and beware. Or keep that shit to yourself, you flaming faggot!  9. If your name is Neil, Dallas, Gavin, Gregory, Brett, Bruce, Craig, Kyle, Andrew, Robert, Laurie/Larry/Lawrence, Aaron, James, Howie, Phil, Jeffrey, Miser, Damian, Terry, Matthew or Luke, then stop living in denial. You're a dung punching arse bandit from way back and everyone knows it.

      Finished watching Big Brother 5 a little while ago.  Looks like it's gonna be a very good season, btw.  Anyways, I decide to celebrate the excellent season opener by having a great big crap.  All went well, thankyouforasking.  But... now the smell is permeating throughout the house.  Cripes.  Now it's a known fact that people don't mind, nay, enjoy their own brand of odor.  But this stench takes the cake.  I can't take it.  Now I know what others go through when I let one rip... Woe is me...  Psst.  Wanna see my desktop?   urlLink Check it out...   I'm kinda hungry.... What to eat,  urlLink what to eat .... Hey! Stay away from my  urlLink noodles!   Hey, it's a  urlLink parade!   Yay!  Well, I'm tired.   urlLink Time for bed.   Ciao for now.

      So, it's my  urlLink birthday  Friday, right?   urlLink Payday , I might add.  I tell the boys at work, and of course, that means  urlLink party time .  So before I know it, they got it allll planned out.  After work, say around 7 pm or so, they're coming over.  Bringing with them  urlLink plenty o' booze , and loads of  urlLink Kentucky Fried Chicken .  A stripper was mentioned by someone, but I mean come on, 200 bucks for 20 minutes of teasing?  I think not.  For 200 bucks I could get me a high quality call girl for an hour (like that would happen, so don't even think it).  So anyways, they figure  urlLink porn  and poker are the way to go.  I ask myself, is this a birthday bash or a bachelor party?  Cripes.    What ever happened to the days of  urlLink cake  and presents and the celebration of one's birth?  Does that end when you turn  urlLink 18 years of age ?  When you're a kid, you're all happy that you're one year older.  But once you hit the big one-eight, it's time to hit the bottle... You're  urlLink getting old ... You've hit that peak and your body begins it's long journey to  urlLink death ... It's your birthday?  Drink up my friend.  Have one on me.  I'm so sorry...  ANYwho, anyone and everyone is invited to come Friday night, if you read this.  The night is not set in stone.  We may just go out as well.  Who knows.  All you gotta know is there's  urlLink gonna be booze .  Nuff Said.

      I'm serious. The governments of the world should forget about the cheesy war in Iraq and talk about something that actually matters - declaring Earth a non-smoking planet. Why? Because cancer and an angry ozone layer fail to create a delightful combination, let alone all the other reasons why smoking is stupid - trash, smelly people, and self esteem (for people who smoke to fit in [fucking dorks]).  Think about it. You've been smoking for several years and you've finally been diagnosed with  urlLink cancer  and the smog index is high in your area. What do you think is going to happen? You got it. You're a dead motherfucker now Leroy. According to  urlLink The Truth web site , “smoking kills more people than AIDS, murder, suicide, fires, alcohol and all  urlLink illegal drugs  combined.” Calculate the numbers yourself then add one, because you have to make sure you count yourself...if you're a smoker. Subtract one if you're a non smoker.  I don’t understand why people smoke because it’s  urlLink disgusting . I decided I wasn’t going to smoke once I read what the Surgeon General had to say about how cigarette smoking causes cancer. If that isn’t enough to scare one away from a pathetic habit, I don’t know what is. Maybe people can’t comprehend the seriousness of a disease that  urlLink eats humans alive.   Cigarette smoke resembles the smell of symbolic  urlLink diarrhea.  I hate when people smoke just moments before entering work or class because they smell terrible. The stale, foul odor lingers disgustingly across the horizon of the room and ruins the air previously known as clean. Yes, smokers, you reek like mad.  The fact that you reek isn’t the worst thing about you. Your lack of consideration for others is, and you're forever known as a  urlLink retard  for smoking. IQ scores don’t matter if you can’t comprehend the seriousness of cancer.  Smokers are also rude. They nonchalantly drop cigarette  urlLink butts  on the ground, out the window, and anywhere else they choose. They're littering. Even if ashtrays are provided in public places, the majority of the smoking fools still litter. If only smokers would be fined for this ridiculous amount of littering. For example, Bobby lung cancer smokes 20 cigs a day and throws them all on the ground or out his car window. The average littering penalty is a $300.00 fine. Do the math and tell me if you're health and bankroll can handle it.  On top of the fines I wish would occur, I can't even walk into a work/class building without having to venture through a cloud of airy phlegm. Even worse, I can't walk from one building to another without being Nascar'ed behind an  urlLink overweight  smoker that's too damn fat for me to take the inside lane.  Another concept about smoking I can never grasp is the fact that there’s an image behind it that supposedly makes  urlLink smokers look cool , yet it only makes them look like bumbling idiots with emphysema sticks bopping up and down on tainted lips.   urlLink Girls  who smoke are the worst. I’ve seen a few girls who were drop-dead gorgeous, but at the spark of a cheap lighter, they became  urlLink "butt-ugly".  And I’m sure their personality wasn’t spectacular enough to puff about either, because if they were that great of a person, they would never smoke in the first place.  In sophomoric conclusion, you're an  urlLink idiot  if you smoke.

I am married to a beautiful young woman named Jackie.  We have a gorgeous baby girl who we've named Celeste (I picked the name).  Right now they're both in Missouri visiting Jackie's folks, thus the time to type down crap for whoever the hell would read this.  Anyways, when I think of anything else for this, I'll be sure to put it in.  Ciao for now.  Steven aka cRaZySoB

      That's right.  Today is MY Friday, as I have taken tomorrow as a holiday, Monday too, so that I could pick up my girls at the airport.  Finally.  After 2 whole months.  Cripes.  So I have got to clean this place.  For 2 months, I've lived as a bachelor.  So you can imagine how much cleaning I've done in that time.  So let's get right to some good stuff, shall we?  Here is  urlLink something  that I want so bad.  And no, you pervs, I don't mean sex.   urlLink Although...    Give the  urlLink little shit  his motherfuckin change already.  For the schoes that work at a desk all day.  I give you... wastebasketball  urlLink I  and  urlLink II .   urlLink XP Lite?   You gotta be kidding.  Well, I'm a waste like you, with nothing else to do.  May I  urlLink waste your time  too?  Just out of curiousity, how do YOU pop your  urlLink zits ?  This is  urlLink something  the female readers will really enjoy.  ;)  Now this is fun.   urlLink Kill  your opponent.  May the best hunter win.

      Bonjourno.  Howdy.  What's up.  Just two more sleeps until my girls come home.  I am very excited.  Ecstatic is the word, methinks.  It has been two whole months since they left for the great state of Missouri.  Two very long, and often very depressing months.  Don't get me wrong, having the queen size bed all to myself was pretty sweet.  But having a woman in the same bed is far better.  I'm tired of throwing my hand in bed and raping it.  The computer nerds/geeks of the world know what I'm talkin bout.  ANYwho, in two days my little monkey baby Celeste will run and give her daddy a great big hug.  Just thinkin about it is makin me feel ferklempt... Talk amongst yourselves... I'll give you a topic... The  urlLink George Bush's daughters  VS  urlLink John Kerry's daughter .  Who's hotter?  Discuss.  Okay.  I'm alright now.  Well, obviously there's nothing on TV or this may or may not be much shorter.  But I've some good links for y'all.  First up, let me ask you, how do you know when you should lose weight?  Maybe it's when you become  urlLink ATTACHED TO YOUR COUCH .  Just when I thought I was king of bringing girls to  urlLink orgasm...    urlLink This guy  must have parked a la Austin Power style.  There's some guys who think  urlLink Britney Spears  is the bomb.  I'm of the opinio that her face just ain't right.  Her eyes seem too far apart.  Mebbe it's just me...  Jackie would probably say that I should get  urlLink one of these  for myself...  Yeah.  As if.  Then I wouldn't get to bask in it.  Everyone loves their own brand, dontchaknow.  Time to  urlLink find the faces!   I found 11.  I am extremely observer.  haha.  American Muscle cars VS Japanese Ricers.  A funny lil  urlLink video.   There's a website for every type of fetish known to man.  I give you...  urlLink AmpuLove.   This is my pick of the day.  Spiderman... reviews crayons.   urlLink Awesome possum .  Nothin can top Spidey.  So I won't try. Think I'll go have a goodnight dump before bed.  Goodnight.

      Way.  A couple people, and by that I mean one, mentioned that I haven't updated in awhile.  Yeah well, I was tired, and lazy.  Mostly lazy.  But actually today, I am quite tired.  I worked until 6 pm.  Making 2 hours overtime.  Now I feel so beat, my muscles so wasted... Bah.  No one cares.  Not one person in the world.  Honestly, do you care?  No.  You're sitting there, thinking to yourself, "You're right, I don't care".  I know that I wouldn't give a rats ass.  What a world.  Now I see that I'm just blathering on and on.  Bite me.  I have no coke in the house, and I haven't had any all day.  Fuck.  So anyways, how's about some good stuff to check out?  Click away mon ami's.
