Then my mother left for genting yesterday and we have to do the housechores..... Damn lazy to do somemore because i have to iron and wash the clothes which the amount is alot.... Then got art to do somemore but i am very lazy to do now..... Tomorrow have this concert because got this guy from a monk turn to a singer is coming... Name is Daniel Zhag and he looks terrible man..... Wonder why some girls in my school like him like Chelsia Leong... Oh well,typical of her to like Chinese singers... FINALLY!!!! WE got back our Geo Ca and Maths Ca!!!!! Maths CA didnt get top.... Because i know i am lousy at graphs but i was very happy with my Geo CA!!!!!
