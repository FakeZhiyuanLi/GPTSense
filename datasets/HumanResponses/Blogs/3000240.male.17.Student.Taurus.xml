						   Wooo finally I have a free house, and do you know what this really cool guy does when it happens, he SLEEPS!! God if I had a pound for every time I've done something boring when the chance came to do something even remotely funky, I guess I could pay for Roman Abramovich to kiss my ass. Anyway, I've had someone mock me today for not including them in this blog, or well at least the past about what townies are acceptable in society from my standpoint, namely a girl from college named Jess. So I've decided this whole thing needs a list of acceptable orgasmic townies, so here they are:  Ian Griffiths Jessica Diggle Lauren Coulten Maryanne Cook Ali Ross (your a closet townie and you know it) and Daniel Kesslar (an in the closet wannabe townie)  One day I will all make you realise anyway, what fools you are for your ignorance in true music, the English Language and in (all except Ali) the greatest football team is. Anyhoo I'm of for a korma, a bath and msn so I'll see you bubbers later . . . xBuBzx

						   Well today didn't go as badly as I thought it would, made all the more better, by a consistently constant barrage of abuse I hurled at my dearly beloved mathematics teacher - Jon Hart. I was desperate, and I mean of the highest most amazingly vital necessity, to take a piss (if not I assure you there would have been a puddle on the floor if I had held the tide in me any longer), and he tried to grab hold of me literally, and have one of these chats he seems to solely give to myself and NO ONE ELSE!!. So I replied "SHUT UP YOU IDIOT" to which he replied "WHAT!", as I ran as fast as I could to the nearest lavatory. He tried (the poor thing bless him) in the lesson there on in, but thus, it was no use to himself, as I continued to mock and down right dissolve his self esteem right to the lessons end. It was a fabuloussite to behold . . . xBuBzx

						   Here's an interesting article from my favorite nine inch nails website   urlLink www.sickamongthepure.com  about a responce to a previous article made in the last months edition of the website made, by an overly concerned fellow NIN fan; and how everyone is capitalist in the music business these days. If you've got the patience to read it, then in my opinion its greatly worth it as an honest insight into popular music today:      Everyone is a Capitalist in the Music Biz: But They're Not All In It For the Cash    The term immediately hurled at a band that has become popular is the evil little title of "sell out".  This term is so easily shoveled out when a single from a long time underground success becomes a regular on the radio.  Now, though it may be fun to say mean bits about bands we don't like, what happens when it's a band you truly respect?  What if you still like the new stuff?  [Gasp]  Does that mean your band has dragged you down into the realm of "crappy music"?  Worse yet, what if you hate the new single from your long time favorite band?  Have they sold their soul for a bit of fame? NO!  I was perusing the "From the Masses" section of this magazine a while back and came across a very, well shall we say honest, reaction to an article regarding the song "Deep".  Well, I went back through the article that spawned such a very "emotional" response from a reader.  The article was a writer's opinion on the apparent lack of musicianship on the track.  Now, I will admit I did not think that "Deep" was Reznor's finest hour but, it had a certain simple quality I was not used to from Nine Inch Nails.  It got me to thinking about the intention behind the song.  Did Reznor really lend his music to an album just to cash in?  Not necessarily.   Yes, this track was a departure from what we have come to know and love about Nine Inch Nails, but I think it is that very thing which leads to Nine Inch Nails to be such an interesting band.  The sound they have produced has never been the same regurgitation, over and over, again re-packaged and re-released (for reference please see: Creed.)  They have not found a set formula for each album and become stagnant with the comfort of a working system of creation (see also: Limp Bizkit.).  I think variation and a constant evolution is essential to the progression of music.  Not every facet of the evolution process is going to be pretty.  All Darwinist's, I think, would agree that some of our post monkey, pre-modern human stages were a little less than beautiful. My point being, yes "Deep" did not exhibit the usual musical power previously wielded by Reznor.  However, this does not mean "Deep" is the end all be all of Nine Inch Nails.  It was not meant to be the culmination of the efforts of those involved with the project.  It was a song that Reznor was likely comfortable with releasing because he felt it would accomplish the one thing he set out to do: make music.  Not every song is going to be a paramount piece of work.  If there were a way to accomplish that, the music world would never change.  Music is a system of trial and error.  If everything had been completely sussed out then the production of new music would be redundant and, well, pointless.   It is ridiculous to fault a musician for making a song you don't like.  For most people good music is not something easily defined.  We will like music depending on how it connects with us.  We all have a song we may not admit to liking in public but secretly do nonetheless because it holds some sort of special memory or emotion for us.  The goal of creating good music is to create music that envelops the listener in a world of pure emotion through the shaping of sound waves and the manipulation of visual images projected from the writer, either through lyrics or through pure musical expression.  I do think "Deep" accomplished that, though maybe, as I said, not to the same level as, let's say, "Something I Can Never Have".  Reznor probably just wanted to vent and it came out as "Deep".   The reader who responded to the article, Mr. Self Destruct, also pointed out a very honest fact: "The song "Deep" is simply just a spur-of-the-moment-to-make-some-fucking-money-song.  If it took you five years every time to record a brilliant album, I'm pretty sure you'd want to release a bullshit pop song every once in a while too.  What use is a mind made for making music if you can't afford to eat Ramen noodles?"  We all often forget music is a business as well.  You have to have money to be able to sustain yourself for five years so you can put together a fantastic album. While I do not agree "Deep" was a "spur-of-the-moment-to-make-some-fucking-money-song", I do think that putting it on the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider soundtrack may have been a way to generate a bit of revenue.  But also look at the greater scheme of things.  By putting the song on a more popular venue Reznor was able to share his feelings with people who may have NEVER dreamt of even listening to Nine Inch Nails.  Yes, is was shocking to have a NIN song share an album with a Missy Elliot song but does doing this invalidate all Trent Reznor has done in the past?  Does this mean he now only wants to make money?  Is Tapeworm only going to be a CD of "Deep" remixed 12 "new" ways?  No.   As far as the claim that the release of halos with re releases of songs we have already heard were done for the mere purpose of making money, again look at the bigger picture. Most of the halos with re-releases on them weren't released in America.  The "We're In This Together" singles (which is my guess as to which albums Curtis Westman was referring to) were released in Sweden, again exposing a new fan base to the music of Nine Inch Nails.   This isn't to say there are not bands out there that do in fact make music solely for the money and fame aspects of the endeavor, but just because a band makes a song that might be more palatable to a new realm of fans does not mean the band has sold out or is now just in it for the money.  That only happens when a band finds a sound that works and beats the particular horse until it bleeds a painful death (refer again to: Limp Bizkit).  Innovation and variation have to be balanced with a business sense.  Though Reznor may not have sold his soul to Carson Daley or whatever tool hosts TRL now, he did take advantage of MTV when he saw it could get his music to the masses.  He sat and talked with his share of VJs.  The one constant, though, has been everything he has produced has been a new experience for him.  If it leads a parallel with your life or mindset and you further enjoy the song, great, if not you'll just have to see what lies over the next hill.  Music is not a level path easily navigated.  It is rather a varied plethora of artistic expression and as long the music is constantly following that path; it is a brilliant artist behind the music.  It is only when music finds a comfortable spot on the path and sets up shop there that makes for awful mind-numbing music.  So yes, there are people making money with music.  Music can be a product used for financial gain, just as a painter may do a commissioned piece.  But there are also those who just wish to capitalize on the chance to share a glimpse of their emotion at the time.  Andy Worhol painted portraits with the same pattern on the same size canvas for money to fund his studio, but the portraits were also being produced on the same size canvas because he planned to put them together to form a giant mosaic made up of all the people he had painted.  He had a greater vision.  I think that just because Reznor made something with a more pop sensibility, it does not make him a sell-out; there is still a library of work to come.  "Deep" may just be the small piece, the single tile, in a much larger mosaic of artistic expression, a single step upon a very long road we have not come to the end of yet.            xBuBzx

						   I woke up rather well today (well being where I don't oversleep), Got all my college stuff together, and I turned on my phone, only to open a message accusing me of spreading bull about one of my oldest friends *who going to remain nameless hence forth* in Esher. I replied "so what have I been saying then?"  So abruptly he told me it was to do with personal information to do with him from which I've denied to the fullest thing I can deny stuff. From previous fallouts that I've been through with this type of circumstance, and knowing this bloke for a fair time, I wouldn't blame him if he decided to despise the ground in which I walked on. I'll be the 1st to admit that, in the past, I've done some God awful sh-it things, which I'd hasten to add that anyone who reads this blog isn't aware of, and won't be in the foreseeable future. Still though Since I've gone to college, I've grown up immeasurably, and this isn't me being egotistical, I have been told by quite a few people, on quite a few occasions in the recent past. Also virtually no-one in Esher knows this guy who I'm talking about anyway (who will be referred to as erm hmmmm . . . Mr X), and the people who do I hate with a passion and don't talk to anyway. I have nothing to spread about Mr X anyway, so why would people be so callust and as cold as they are at the moment even just to spite me.   Anyway this hasn't been the best of start to the day, as I'm sure your well aware of, but the day is still young, and there's a lot of things to be cheerful about I guess. Meh so I'll tell you later about the day. xBuBzx

						   Ok I'm really soberly subdued, finding it particularly difficult to concentrate on anything other than this blog at the moment, and not work, and yes I know, that obviously it should be the reverse, I know, but work I find is an impossible chore at this time during the day, or any time of the day for that matter. Jesus knows I'd like an admirable ethic in relation to working, I've been praying on my knees for decades (3 to be exact), but it never seems to be able to pay of. So I've come to the two most sensible conclusions I can think of:  God must really hate me, or i'm just a lazy bugger, Personally I think both hypothesis are quite plausable.    I'm listening to a weird trippy poppy/techno/rock kind of song by the dissociatives and called the thinking in reverse, and from my opinion, its quite a fresh outlook on how to try to construct a decent song. Any of you who are bothered to listen go to  urlLink http://www.thedissociatives.com/music/audio/audio.htm . Wait for it to kick in it takes a while for the initial intro to finish.  Anyhoo, Ian and myself have decided to go house hunting in the little hamlet of Mitcham this Easter. It's becoming increasingly evident to myself that I can't stand living with my parents (an obvious cliche for people my age as I'm sure you're all too well aware of) however, I'm really quite excited by the prospect with living with completely different people, in utterly unfamilier circumstances. I know where I live is comfortable, well of, where people love and respect me (I hope), and money is never an issue really. Life however I know is one great big lord-of-the-rings-est journey and I'm more than curious and ready to find out the difficult circumstances that lie ahead, whatever they may be. As the saying goes (from the great Homer Simpson): "I WANT TO LIVE MARGE, I WANT TO LIVE!". xBuBzx urlLink

						   I thought slowly as time drifts by, I’d need sleep less and less. I mean why waste you life with unconsciousness unless you actually desperately need it. There's other far more interesting and important schools of thought to consider i.e. breathing.   Anyhow, I'm also finding out how wrong I was as I found for yet another "overslept" excuse given to my old decrepit excuse for parents, for me not turning up to college yet again. Oh well This seems to affect my college work (I am infact a self-confessed lazy asshole) and I fail to hardly do any work which means I have to work outside the confides of the college, as I recently got god awful mock exam marks in both sociology and psychology, and as for philosophy . . . Well I haven't even done it yet gulps. Well I feel kind of null anyway not just because of the sleep; I just really miss my friends like Anna I guess and a whole load of other issues which, most probably are left deep in my subconscious somewhere.  I had my nephew over today, and he was being an obnoxious fucker as usual, so I stuck him in the oven and cooked him (lol only joking), but it's been a boring day nether the less. Mum is annoyed at me again, I guess her ego got bruised again or something, no idea why though. Anyhoo meh i'm bored. So 'm gunna try to define youth into strict categories later. Keep my mind sane . . . xBuBzx

						   Okies this an article from one of my favourite sites in the world www.sickamongthepure.com (don't bother visiting it if your not a nine inch nails fan like myself). Otherwise enjoy the article:    Letter from a disgruntled human being to the state of everything     If I have to sit on hold for one more minute, I will, I swear, lose my mind.  It won't be pretty.  Not only will you not allow me to speak with your manager, you also will not satisfactorily rectify my situation, make good on your promise to me.  And it isn't because doing so would be terribly difficult, or even against policy; you simply won't, because you know you don't have to. Isn't that the wonderful thing about free will?  You don't have to do one iota more than you wish to, and yet there is nothing to prevent you from complaining about it for time untold.  You don't have to have an opinion about anything, or a foundation for the ones you do have, yet you are allowed to fault others for theirs.  You never have to do one kind act for another human being your entire life, yet you can request, nay, demand it, of others.  All of the laws and rituals we have in place to maintain order; in the end they really have very little to do with justice, don't they? So if I have to sit here at this insane gathering, and listen to one more of you prattle on about your back pain, your indigestion, and your headaches, while you are stuffing your faces with french fries, sitting in front of your computer and sucking back coffee and pop, I will, in fact, lose it altogether.  Another promising mind disappears into the chaos of evermore.  Another scream lost in the white noise of industry.  I must say, Everything, while I'm still capable of saying it: you've lost control of your state.  You've succumbed to what you are. I am writing you this letter to tell you I want my subscription cancelled immediately.  I no longer want to turn on my television to watch the news and see these pitiful levels of "corruption" in my government, in their government, in all of them.  I no longer want to read excuses from my favourite musicians for not putting out another album, nor do I want to watch people's freaky fans demand things from other people they were lucky to get to begin with.  I no longer want to hear these well-groomed masses reiterating over and over again just how successful they are, in the hopes they themselves will believe it.  I no longer want to see one nation even try to justify going to war with another in this day and age.  I don't want to see your dominion looking to another source of power rather than working for themselves.  I would also like my money back for the time I did subscribe to your organization.  However, I realize this will be next to impossible, for I've seen the way your people keep their books, and since they can barely differentiate between a fur coat, a tank, a taxpayer, and a nourishing meal, I don't expect they would be even capable of finding my file, much less gleaning any worthwhile information from it if they did. Furthermore, I would like an all-expenses paid one-way trip from The State of Everything to Somewhere Better, or, if that deems too expensive, Somewhere Else.  I am told in Somewhere Better, people don't destroy every single thing they touch.  I have heard they treat people with the reverence we give our possessions, that the people who have devoted their lives to leading them have done so because they are good and intelligent, and because they are capable of making their world a better place. Even in Somewhere Else, the laws are very clear on what is Granted, so clear in fact that nothing is ever taken for it.  Because they have been able to make this important distinction, the people there are no longer mired in the religious or secular teachings of the State of Everything, whose greatest of failed motives were to instill an appreciation for that very big difference and act accordingly.  The people there aren't paralyzed by our inability to think or act of our own accord without first placing someone or something clearly in the path of our progress, whom we can then blame and receive reparations from.  In Somewhere Else, people are smart.  Which is more than I can say for your customer service team.    Sincerely,  Disgruntled Human Being.   xBuBzx

						   I promised you people some background information on myself which some random people emailed me asking me for, when they strangely stumbled on this site during their boredom, and I hasten to tell you and them, I almost forgot so I apologise. Well; whoever you are who reads this more than perculiar site, this is a short history lesson in my self-procclaimed bubzification . . . My full name is Matthew Edwin Jack Smith, I'm 16 (17 in 3 weeks yay), I live in West Molesey, Surrey in the UK. Im a rather disproportionately shaped looking bloke (ie ugly to non politically correct/normal folk). I go to Esher College which is about a mile away from Hampton Court where I study sociology, philosophy and psychology at as-level. I hope to be a counselor one day. My interests include sport (Chelsea fc especially) and alternative industrial, metal music. I have 1 brother (Andrew 30) and one sister (Joanne 32) and a five year old nephew called Harry. My parents (John and Carol) are both 57 and should be retiring (and die slowly in my opinion) this year. Any hoo that's all I really have to say for myself. Anything else you want know you'd have to ask to me personally. Anyone wants to get in contact with me my msn is matthewsmith157@hotmail.com xBuBzx

						     The Teenage Sell-out    There you walk, With your self-governing esteem held high, Flicking your cliché bleached hair, Drawing the wondering eyes of the evanescent primitive male, Masticating your gum as quickly as the inhalation from the cheap tobacco. Your vocabulary makes quantum physics, As straightforward as subtraction, Whilst your whole feeble-minded body, Yields to the nauseating tackiness of the whore image, In which you embrace upon yourself with blinded faith.  Ah your stubborn nature is the comedic notion to my ears. The limited thought perspective, Has transparently corrupted the link between your words and brain. The ineptitude of your moral standards,  Would indeed turn Plato in his grave.  Thank God that you exist in the parabola of your own universe, At least the clear minded ones can view your glass galaxy, Each time they flow past your laughable “individuality“, With righteous pity.  xBuBzx

						   College is a funny thing. When there's nothing to (as there invariably isn't) I sit and people watch usually from the confides of my music in the LRC. I see people who used to have their rebellious streak fade to dust and turn to the sellouts I like to call townies. Now I'm not saying all townies are bad people (take my friend Ian for example) but I'd say, whilst yes I'm horribly generalising here, that most are shallow, big headed, narrow minded individuals who have a warped view of what the modern day English language. What's more many few see to evade the evil clutches of the repo men or seem to navigate there way around a decent roofing company (bad attempt at a joke I know). I can't say i'd like to force my views upon others on this matter, but surely there is another way to live out the "most important years of your life" for sure.  Anyhoo, they seemed to have found a new planet today, the 1st for 73 years. I'm sad I know I view this as an important day in my life, but it's amazing what science finds nowadays. College was ok but I'm increasingly finding even with people for compay at lunch, there's fuck all to do most of the time, unless you sleep on the couches, or go to Wimbledon or Surbiton at lunch, which can cost loads . . .

						   Omost of the time as I get bored from time to time, i'm gunna blog some literature in here always entitled literature and this is my 1st entry. Hope you enjoy it:  One Of Them  Oh how I wish to be someone else: To walk along the corridor with my head held high To be looked up to on my own actions To have my time completely filled. To experience what I have always naturally craved- Not to be patronised. That is what I have always longed for.  Once I was close, but never close enough, I was amongst them, smiled and laughed with them But never really there. Then one day, the whispers came Apparently I was not “all” man And with that, all smiles stopped Striking me down like a punch to the solaplexus  From which I never got up.  Having sold my secret soul to Damien Time, growth, life came to a hollow stop I existed inside the hell of my own Pandora’s Box. As my pain grew, their anger intensified; Small demons poked their fiery sticks through my bars As if they were never going to let me leave- Even heavenly intervention could not break their walls.  But over time, I was flung into memory Forever seen as an obsolete “faggot” at the back of the class. From time to time, their brimstone torched my body Until its casing hardened, formed a cast Inside which died my longing to be one of them.

						   This has been one odd weekend. After the rave, I've just been thinking and contemplating about everything I can at the moment, like where in the hell is my life going. Im glad for the solidarity and consistently after school, but now I'm just waiting for something big to happen once again. I'm still in some parallel random sorting thought zone, trying to sort my whole group of friends into groups, and you know what, I think I'm almost there at last.  Anyhoo, was a relatively average day at work, although I'm getting increasingly pissed of with my new "boss" Becky, she's just become incredibly patronising and now should officially die - slowly - in her own filth. Apart from that it was ok and I came home to the great news that Manure (Man U) had lost 4-1 to City. Wrestlemania tonight (yer I know I'm sad but who cares). I guess I'll post later on about more important stuff when anything happens to come to light in this ever increasingly warped mind of mine - BuBz

						   I think it's going to be a rather kick ass weekend again as my weekends are slowly but surely becoming of late, as I'm of to a rave with my friend Anna and going to an obscure but funky film festival on Saturday. I think also I'm gathering some decent work ethic. I've almost done my coursework for maths and I'm beginning to work quite hard in the three as-levels I'm taking, well all be it not at home and only in the college library, but hey it's a start at least, and is ten times better than what I could have managed say a month ago. Well have a good weekend whoever you are, I'm of to do some psychology - whoooo me I'm working.  xBuBzx

						     Article:  Suicide    This is why I value every day and every second of breathing now.  I'm so happy at college, I realise that. Happy as I am now, and as inappropriate as it is to post this on a public site, it shivers me to remember what my mental state was like a mere 8 months ago. Imagine what it is like to walk into a room and fall victim to the unrepentant and systematic torment that is the locusts of your class "mates"; and just maybe you could see a glimmer of what my life was like. You hasten and begin to think that the people you inhabit school are the archetype of humanity, forgetting the fresh breeze of multicultural, such is the rigor and stiffness of the regime and people, that is Halliford.  I was young in every sense of the word there. Maybe I was never naturally inclined to be a private school boy, or maybe I'm just stubborn I'm never quite sure, but I hated the 6 years I spent in the abyss there. I have my limits, and I'm not going to ever tell too much information about my implosion into excrement within the dying embers of my time there, however if you would like a clue: I trusted people I shouldn't, and provoked flames in people who had been looking for the excuse against me for years. I can't say I'm completely fault-ridden I've done some and made some God awful catastrophe's, but even in my mind, what I went through was largely unjust. I've learnt not to dwell on the past, but I'll never relieve myself of the bitter taste that pollutes my saliva whenever the thoughts of them come to mind.  I came very close to ending it all. Maybe none of you realise it and never will, but luck, my nephews envisaged crying face, and the bottom of my mental stability saved me. Standing on top of the block of flats near the precinct, thinking jump and realising that it can't get lower than being on top of here where so many other people have jumped from in the past.  I built a fortress and I became rather bedridden the preceding summer, but at least there was a genuine look at short term hope. I went to Esher and the rest is history. It's not worth saying any more, I just get resentful and bitter at everything. The whole thing taught me that you have to be happy through life and keep your head up whatever your going through there is always the horrible cliche of light at the end of the tunnel.  xBuBzx

						   There is a match for the ages as it would be said in pro-wrestling tonight as the 1st leg of the 2003/04 Champions league quarter finals is played between the 2 English clubs left in the competition - Chelsea and Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. This game is absolutely huge from my point of view, as, quite usually from my prospective, I'm outspoken as I feel this will be the absolute making of Ranieri as Chelsea manager. If he, like I hope to God he will, lead us to our first victory over them since 99' in the League Cup, then he will be well and truly be taking us up another level, however if we lose over the tie then I'd rightly say his time is up. The guy has with the team during in the course of the season, despite the constant close-knit victories, only a handful of absolutely decent performances (i.e. Newcastle at home), the rest of the time we were lucky and at the right place at the right time. True, I believe whoever leads the team next season, we will improve on this one, but shouldn't a manager who can play attacking football and still better the results Ranieri's getting be in charge? His style, baffling tactics, lack of understanding what even his best team is, surely stifling the gelling of the team, and causing already reported public unrest within squad. I have thought however he is a decent man, with morals and dignity, especially throughout the constant barrage of pressure he's faced this season, and I do want him to do well, but oh well at the moment we can get any manager in the world who's mind would be swayed by money (which is practically all of them) so why stay with Ranieri, a pretty average-good manager, just for the fact of being just and that there's no absolute must-have reason to get rid of him, when we can get a world class manager i.e Arsene Wenger clone, which Ranieri I'm afraid to say isn't. Roman Abramovich as I'm sure your all well aware of didn't get to the top of the business world by not being absolutely ruthless and in the words of old Santa-Claus Ken Bates, he is an absolutely brilliant business man, so what chance does Ranieri have anyway?  Anyway, we have been beaten by them for years. I can remember stretching back to junior school that I used to come home on a Sunday from one occasion or another, that we had - inevitably - been defeated well by them once again. My theory (like the one's why Tottenham can't beat us nor we beating Blackburn at home) is that every team has a style that never well and truly changes over the years, and we are a lesser form of Arsenals, and always have. Any team who plays the same style or one less efficient than Arsenals 99/100 will be beaten, and Chelsea have never been the 1/100 via fate and God I guess. Arsenal are without a doubt, like AC Milan at the moment, awesome. If they had a decent Right back, which (like I think they will in the summer if they lure Hasem Trabelsi from our grasp when his contract runs out at Ajax) they'd be perfect. The only way in which we will beat them will either be a 0-0 at the Bridge and a 1-1 at Highbury, which lets face it is highly unlikely considering that Arsenal will score tonight whatever defence we put out, they always do, and can shut out shop at Highbury, which they've never really had to do too much, but they would defend there by attacking and inevitably score, which is by far the best form of defence; or by nullifying Viera and dominating the midfield, which lets face it is the hardest job in football. We'll have to be on top of our game no doubt about it, and they'd have to have a rare off day. I live in pessimism and hope rather than expectation, and lets face it tonight, most Chelsea fans are after the 3 2-1 defeats to them already this season. Despite also Arsenal showing signs of fatigue, I think they're an intelligent enough team to know that once they recently annihilated Bolton et al recently, to let of the pedal to reserve energy for the 4 major ties that lay ahead of them, and beside they have a well-documented history of being able to raise their game and staying calm when the going gets tough.  Fear will hold us prisoner, hope will let Arsenal score. In my opinion it's a no win situation for Chelsea, but wouldn't it be sweet if . . . . . . . . . make sure you watch it tonight, whatever happens it will be one hell of a match.  xBuBzx

						   I've been at home all day, chewing the fat mainly, pretty average by anyone's standards. I have a mountain to work to do but I can never really get round to doing it, takes too much thinking and my beloved blog is far more interesting. It's Chelsea v Arsenal in the quarter finals of the champions league, and we haven't got a snowballs chance in hell even over 2 legs, even I know that deep down, but come on Chelsea lets kick some gooner arse for once.  Also discovered I've inspired the 1st person I know (Jon from work) to begin a blog, so it's like having a blog child I guess, or inspiring one, meh I'm weird I know. Thought of me moving out are still as intense as ever, I still have to think about the whole situation a lot more though which is something I'm gradually getting better at after years of mental-to-action effect, if you understand anything of what that meant . . .  xBuBzx

						   Well whether it be the over exposure to them, or this silly little traffic lights party, I've had it, and now I'm focused here on venting my anger on the most vigorous of diseases also known as townies. Well first I guess a definition - or better yet, let me link to you to a survey of definitions  urlLink http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=townies&f=1 . Well apart from the fact that my college is infested with the little fuckers, the sell-out craze as I like to call it (when townies in an area increases) is in full throttle there. I have a messed little theory that pre-townie, the devil (ie older teens who are already townies) tempt them just like Jesus was in the desert, and the majority of the time they give in (the girls especially think they look more attractive putting themselves across as good time girls rather than people with any sense of morals or values).   Anyway at college at the moment there is this party coming up, (which I think my friend Rachael is going to i'm not sure) and as always the townies have made it an R'n'B infected event, with no sense of real or decent music involved I'm afraid, but they seem to be ecstatic about the whole cherade, and are weeks into there preparations for it. Anyway, I'll discuss this issue tomorrow in more detail . . . xBuBzx

						   So the anti-humans (who I will refer to from here on in as my parents) returned form they're pilgrimage to see the oracle (who shall be known as my dear grandmother) all bitchy and with a fresh incentive to cause grief upon myself and strangely but characteristically not to others. Nehoo, I went to Roehampton university for there open day, and I was quite pleasantly surprised at how big and unlike college, clean the whole area. I mean I'm quite surprised that in greater London there's actually a large a space that there is there, I mean there's parks and ducks and everything to awaken the senses for when you become bored with the pressure of university work.   I went to this odd party in Molesey on Saturday night, and being in Molesey there were quite a few people inevitably from work present (work being Tesco's for people who don't know) and I'm yet to make up my mind whether it was good or bad. I guess when I heard my friend say "if your initial reaction to a party isn't good, then it never was", he was most probably right, and anyway the guys whos party it was was an adultaring up his own arsehole anyway, so that just about has tipped the balance into the bad side of the court.  I hope to get tickets for Chelsea next week, just heard some more have been made available, but it seems doubtful, but hopefully it will all come of anyway I'll post later. xBuBzx

						   Oh great, let me jump for joy its my day in two days.  I think something must be horribly wrong.  I really can't stand the whole thing this year, it all seems pretty pointless, and I guess it's going to be this way until I'm 80 and in a wheelchair whilst valuing every day I continue to breath.  The individual who had been backstabbing me to "Mr X" never owned up, so I must take it that they were rather cowardly and quite falsely angry at me for some reason. So whoever you are you anully retentive fool, I hope you die slowly in your own filth as the devil castrate's you.  The silent treatment I'm handing out to my Mother is working a charm, as, after only three days she has cracked already. Little does she know of how long I can extend this epic feud with her until she eventually breaks well and truly; more so than she's ever known. I know it may seem harsh of me for doing such a thing against my own mother, however I feel quite betrayed by what she's done, which Is a bit too personal to post on the internet even for me, but believe me when I say you'd feel just as angry if it had happened to yourself. So I came to the conclusion after such a brilliantly monumental start, that I might use these mind games to its full effect for a little while longer - my next plan being to refuse to see her at all during my birthday, which I know to most of you doesn't seem like a harsh thing, but considering how much I know she values spending the day with me, and the fact that there's no college, this opportunity seems priceless. Oh how I love being cold . . . xBuBzx

						   Why is it that when I talk to my brother that I should feel like I'm talking to a complete stranger (and I don't mean in the metaphorical sense). I mean I've know the man for 17 years on Monday, and it really worries me to say I feel I know him, and I would feel comfortable talking to him as I would if a random hobo walked up to me on the street. I'm not saying he's a horrible person, he's a nice guy and an awesome father, but we never really seemed to click as people. Oh well clash of personalities I guess.  Nehoo I went to a looong philosophy lecture today at Goldalming college, and it felt like hell honestly, all apart from the Aprils fools joke that happened at the beginning.   I'm knackered though so I'll see you later xBuBzx

						   I've had enough from Philosophy, my Christian friends and strangely the other day Daniel Kesselaar and so I feel I have to clear a subject up in my mind - religion.  I believe when you die you die. Simple as that. People will say "but you have to believe in something otherwise life isn't really worth living" but it is what I believe because I feel you can't just believe in anything purely on blind faith. Like for say in a court of law you have to prove an incident happened within all reasonable doubt, and that in my opinion is exactly what you should apply for religion as well.  There hasn't (beside a few debatable cult religious books which attracted many followers, due to the fairy tale and "overly accurate" story lines of miracles and coincidences which according to them couldn't have happened without God's "divine intervention" e.g. the Koran and bible) ever been any conclusive evidence for God's existence, despite many fair and well put arguments i.e. ontological and teleological.  I don't think I've got the time to go into the suffering issue, however you must admit it's almost a solid and firm argument against the Deity (God).  So I might as well leave you with a question - if we found intelligent life on another planet (which is probably likely one day considering how absolutely huge the Universe is) - what would you religious believers think then?  xBuBzx

						   Wow they over react so easily. I over slept again as I always seem to do on a Tuesday and she came home to me in my PJ's on the couch and she freaked. We then had a massive war with her using mind games and me throwing grapefruit, and now in the end I'll be the one in the dog house probably by Dad so if I don't happen to post on here for the next few days, it's because I've been banned form the computer et al. Mum does this all the time, using her "trump card" as my sister once called it to invoke sympathy. It was her and Dad which made me decide about quitting education two weeks ago, but I think now I might be going to turn on that decision. It would all mean I'd get to move out quicker and move in with Ian, which would be pretty cool considering what I live with in this house. Oh well *sigh* xBuBzx

						   I'm counting down not just the seven days left until my birthday, but also the five short one's until the two week Easter break, which will mean an enormous amount of overtime at work which will hopefully help to sooth my already stretched bank balance. Also it will (although unlike what my Dad thinks, if I take the overtime at work) the opportunity to work quite a bit towards my exams, which are only a few weeks away. Judging from my profiling last week, I need to work my ass of to get the c's I really need. Oh well, I must be getting on with this work with some Psychology, so ciao for now. xBuBzx

						   Friday was one gooood looong stress reliever of a night at the electric ballroom in Camden at "sin city" with Anna, Jade and there respective lovers who seem like cool people. Went funkily although it seemed to last forever in there. Anyway when we left it was about 4 in the morning and we all drifted around Camden (not as dangerous as I had thought it would have been) until daylight and the first buses came. Anyway got to Hammersmith about 7 and then got home via the tubes and whats not. Once I slept it all of I called Anna about the obscure film festival we were planning to go to on the Saturday night, but she never turned up, and that's when my bad luck started. Well it's a lot easier for me to list it so her you go:  1. Couldn't get change a 10 pound note to call Anna from anyone 2. When I eventually did the phone booth didn't work 3. Train delayed back to Waterloo 4. When it started I learnt I was on the wrong train 5. Then cunningly (I thought) I'd get of at bank and get on the waterloo and city line but as soon as I got to the platform I learnt it was shut. 6. Got to Kennignton but missed train just and had to wait 3 quarters of an hour for the next one 7. Got to Waterloo, and called Anna but she didn't pick up 8. Had to wait for 3 quarters of an hour for the train to Kingston 9. When I eventually got to Kingston I had to wait for an hour for the 411 10. Eventually got home to a bollocking from my parents.  Hooray gave me new hope for suicide.  xBuBzx

						   I've found to my discomfort that the only thing in life I crave I food. Forget drugs, alcohol and tobacco, food is the curse of my life. It's going to surely get exceedingly worse as the Easter holiday approaches, as the capitalist advertising temptation also known as Easter comes into full throttle. God knows how I'm going to survive this Friday, Sunday and Monday at work with the mountain of Easter eggs at my disposal *sighs*. I guess my will power will have to be on full alert and my eyesight somewhat temporarily afflicted with some tropical infection to survive the war against the flab - but I'm determined to do it.  Oh and by the way . . .  thanks Jen for the birthday mention, made me feel all warm inside, even if the hot chocolate at the time didn't.  xBuBzx

						   Well I've spent the last few days in Mitcham at my sisters flat, trying to get away from it all for a few days holiday I guess, so I'm sorry I haven't posted much recently, however I promise I'll change that in the indefinite future.  So where to begin - first of it wasn't such a bad birthday after all I saw the Christ movie and I have to say for such an overtold story, such as the crucifixion, it was done wonderfully. The fact they used subtitles, only added to the reality of the whole situation, and every character (apart from unfortunately Jesus I hasten to say) was cast to perfection. Maybe Mel Gibson could have tried it although I doubt the results would have been greatly different. I saw the movie with Jo and her mate Wendy who is the funniest large lady in the world - bar none. The morning was spent with the continuation of the minimal dialogue epic between me and my mother, with Harry there to ease the tension somewhat. The presents were pretty average for my birthday, not that I'm complaining mind you, I'm always pretty contempt with any present anyone ever gives me.  Anyway the day after was most definitely, more than previous days I'd used the example, bitter-sweet. My sister woke up and I was left there watching Harry Potter for a couple of hours. The as a delivery came, I forgot to putt the lock on the latch and it slammed shut behind me and I was left there with only my baggy PJ's on for a couple of hours. The once I managed to gather the strength and knocked on some one's door to use the phone. I was greeted by a lovely large Caribbean lady (whose name sadly evades me) who gave me tea and somewhere to warm my frost bitten feet. Once Mum had come with the keys I hyped myself up for the football. I take back that big speech I made just a couple of weeks ago about how we couldn't beat Arsenal, well, WE DID IT, WE BEAT ARSENAL DAMMIT, and it was well and truly brilliant in every sense of the word. Now we face Monaco in the semis, after unbelievably (well not really considering what there defense is like) they beat Real Madrid, and I really now can see a Chelsea v Milan final, which we would have an outside, but decent chance of winning *dreams*. Well I'll see you lot later then . . . xBuBzx

						     Escape . . .    It's astounding how much of our world is based upon avoiding our problems.  You would think that in our fast-paced and efficiency-driven society, solving problems and achieving goals quickly and efficiently would be one of our top priorities.  On the contrary, it seems that following through with our thoughts to their final completion has a very low priority for most modern people.  This difficulty appears in the workplace, where there are so many layers of management that any problem simply exists forever in the pool of unfinished tasks, shunted from executive to executive, until eventually it is a moot point. But primarily it appears in people's day-to-day lives, where they avoid dealing with unfinished thoughts, unpleasant ideas, and unwanted consequences.   As I look inside my mind, I'm unsure what to call what I see.  In a childish way I wish to give it a childish label:  "A Swirling Vortex of Doom!!!"  However juvenile the term may be, I believe it has some merit.  My mind is definitely a swirling vortex.  Unfinished thoughts, ideas, and emotions tumble on without end.  Nothing is ever resolved.  In our modern and busy life, you never have time to actually resolve an issue: everything is given a Band-Aid-style fix, and then you move on to the next item.  Unfortunately, every unfinished thought stays in your poor mind, polluting your consciousness and buzzing with unfulfilled desires.  It might be easy to say you can go about your everyday life, not really needing to have a truly clean and fresh mind.  You might want to leave such luxuries to philosophers or other thinkers, since you believe your life has not been adversely affected by these stray thoughts.  However, I know a good many people who suffer from some of the symptoms of having too many unfinished thoughts floating around their mind.  An inability to fall, or stay, asleep is a prominent one.  I've heard many people complaining on buses, subways, or restaurants, about having been unable to sleep last night because they couldn't clear their mind, or being woken up in the middle of the night and being unable to get back to sleep for one or two hours, due to some persistent thought they couldn't dismiss.  One major cause of this?  Your mind is trying to resolve these contentious and polluting issues, while you refuse to give it the chance to do so.  It is unable to achieve the necessary level of clarity required for sleep.  A lack of focus in the workplace is another common symptom of having an occupied mind.  How many times have you been sitting at work, trying to focus on your daily tasks, when your mind keeps wandering off towards other concerns?  It is extremely difficult to dedicate your undivided attention to a topic when your subconscious mind wants to give your attention to other thoughts.  However, most frequently, you simply try to brush aside those other subconscious thoughts for later consideration, focusing solely on your work-related tasks.  You have deemed clearing your mind of unwanted ideas to be unworthy of your time, even though dealing with those extraneous thoughts before turning to the task at hand will lead to greater productivity and a more efficient use of your time.  Modern society seems to encourage leaving thoughts unresolved.  People, on some subconscious level, know they need to have clear minds.  They know in order to truly relax, they need to be working with an empty slate.  However, most people don't know how to achieve this state.  So, they turn to the answers society provides: drugs, alcohol, sex, vacations.  These classic things are the goals of most men's recreation.  But you look at these goals, and what they do for your mind.  Do they help you deal with the issues at hand?  No.  Do they help permanently push them out of your mind?  Not a chance.  What they do is temporarily alleviate the stresses on your soul.  They help you forget about the woes of everyday life; they don’t actually deal with them, but merely allow you to put them out of your mind for a very short time.  There are more permanent and productive alternatives out there.  Meditation, talking out your problems with friends, or analytically dealing with these issues, are just a few of the simpler and more available ones.  And upper management is slowly latching onto these ideas, with therapists and psychologists abounding to listen to your problems, many mini-retreats with courses on how to solve problems and achieve your goals, and ever popular self-help books offering to teach you how to center yourself and calm your mind.  But there are still millions of middlemen out there who haven't worked a problem through to satisfactory completion in many years.  The only time they ever achieve silence of the mind is while on a beach in the Caribbean or drunk out of their minds.  I think people need to deal with their problems.  It's a hard process to begin, but once begun, the clarity you've achieved will help you deal with more and more problems, until eventually you're walking through everyday life with the same relaxed mentality as most people only achieve in a drunken stupor.  People need to focus their lives less on drink and on vacation and focus their lives more on personal development of the mind, and dealing with their own internal issues.  This may not be the key to eternal happiness, but it may be a helpful and simple step towards that elusive goal. xBuBzx

						   Looking threw my blog, and thinking about anything in particular I've never discussed on here, and it came to me that I've never really talked about the whole love epic in great detail. So this is my theory in my current thinking climate (which let it be known changes on a daily basis).  I see many really quite attractive people at college. There's only a few I'd safely say that I fancy as such. Take one person for example, they're not pwahhhh and they don't like to flaunt what they don't genuinely think they have, which is a refreshing feature for me to find attraction in, as it safely delves away from what I'd usually be attracted to. The person too is also quiet and anyone could tell, if they met them, that they sway away from attention full stop. They are really "pretty" or "cute" and go around they're daily ramblings with a certain elegance and style mainly associated with the majority of people the same age as them. This is something I have always really quite respected in a person.  Shame my end of the bargain will never be nearly up to scratch. Shame. It's not like they're someone I can't stop talking to about absolutely everything, and they don't particularly blow my mind as such, however it would have be nice to have something stable, or just something for that matter. It's been so long since, if ever, that I've had an exclusive relationship with anyone. Sad I know, but esteem, confidence and attraction et al is never anything or will never be something that I'll have in abundance, so I'll just have to lie in my cave, contempt with my lot, until I drag myself to reach the phone book looking for a decent counselor to "re-enlighten me" and give me a "re-birth" in life.  There must be a million people out there just like me (my sister most definitely included there . . . . . . HA), waiting for just something at least, and I guess we find at least someone who is the great love of your existence, but God its a long time waiting, a very long time indeed. xBuBzx

						   What in hell were Chelsea doing last night. We were comfortable,  very  comfortable at 1-1 and we had to throw it away. I heard on one of the fan sites that we got "caught out" and I think this is true in many senses. 3-1 isn't the worst result in the world, but God dammit, we have play out of our Caracas' to win it in the second leg. It can be done, it's possible most certainly, and still we are only 90 minutes away from a date in Germany. I pray to God that we get there, and lets have hope instead of cliche pessimism. xBuBzx

						   Good God the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI -FINALS!!! So how on Earth (and no disrespect to Chelsea but . . .) has the European Cup become so easy to win. Oh well who fucking cares. Well we play Monaco tonight which can only be described as huge. I feel that this match will be significant and ponders a couple of questions for a couple of reasons: isn't this just a little above the station for Chelsea, but we will well and truly never have a better chance of lifting the trophy than we will do in foreseeable evolutionary future. It's a shame that Gallas and Duff are out otherwise I think Ambrosio apart we would have has the strongest 11 available. I think we will be able to do it, but our defense needs to be on top of its game to stop Europe's most prolific goal scoring machine of the year. If we sneak a 1-1 or a 0-1 or even a 2-1 to Monaco I'll be happy, just as long as we score . . . May God be with us tonight. xBuBzx

						   So I've finally dragged myself back to the  shit-hole  of a place that, I love to digress to your good selves about the mishaps and novelties about life - yes you guessed it in one . . . . the LRC at college. Well I fully understand that I failed to posted anything remotely worthwhile during Easter and this was for a number of reasons:  1. I was ill 2. I couldn't be bothered 3. Chewing the fat seemed a more than viable alternative 4. There was a wart on my shin which needed annihilating with a hefty pair of garden shears.    Anyhoo   I did get the sense of incredible loneliness and so I felt it was justly time for an ounce of soul searching and a slow but solid ponder about the view you get when you stand on the edge of cliffs or high storey flats and how it would truly feel to kick the bucket.  OOOOOOOOOh also I think I've really opened up about something, which sadly I won't go into, but has helped enormously, and I cried, REALLY cried away about everything, probably because it was a more genuine emotion than I usually have over things ( If you understand me on that one, your a better man than I, I apologise for its waffling ). However the whole thing has kind of helped me sort a few lingering problems and stamp some labels on unclear things (or maybe get me nearer finally doing them), and now I'm sure that I'll have a sudden new zest for things and I'll hopefully be able to take on things more full on, without the usual side-tracking I feel I have to do. So I promise a lot more wonderful pointless posting which I can well and truly excel at. Yay xBuBzx

						   Here's part one of a net biography of my favorite band Nine Inch Nails:    Swimming In The Haze: Part One - Nine Inch Nails And The Pretty Hate Machine Years    Trent Reznor was born Michael Trent Reznor on May 17, 1965, in the sleepy rural town of New Castle, Pennsylvania.  Reznor's sister, Tera, was born in 1971, and was to be the last child of Mike and Nancy Reznor.  Reznor's parents soon split up.  Tera went to live with her mother, while Trent was shipped off to be raised by his maternal grandparents in the tiny hamlet of Mercer, Pennsylvania.  By Reznor's own description, Mercer was "a nice little picturesque one-horse, one McDonald's kind of town."  By all accounts, Trent Reznor was the typical American youngster raised in the typical American fashion, participating in Boy Scouts, building model airplanes, and skate boarding.  His grandparents would also later put him through the typical childhood nightmare of piano lessons.  Reznor's piano teacher, Rita Beglin, has allegedly compared his playing to the likes of Harry Connick, Jr., though this 'fact' was difficult to verify over the Internet.  In the later high school years, Reznor has been described as being clean cut, handsome, and popular.  Reznor was also in the high school jazz and marching bands, where he played both tenor sax and keyboards.  He was also voted 'Best in Drama' by his peers and classmates.  Actually, Reznor was the absolute modicum of popularity he would later rebel so violently against in the not-so-distant future.  After graduation, Trent Reznor moved to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Allegheny College and majored in Computer Engineering.  After one year of spinning his wheels, Reznor soon realized that programming computers for the rest of his life wasn't his calling.  So, Reznor unknowingly engaged in the tired cliche of dropping out to pursue a career in music, and relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, to chase the rock and roll dream.  During the early and mid-1980s, Trent Reznor was involved in several small-time, Flock of Seagulls-type bands, including The Exotic Birds (where he would meet his future drummer, Chris Vrenna) and 1000 Homo DJs, which involved Al Jourgensen of future Ministry fame.  Said bands were a continual disappointment to Reznor, however, and he found himself leaving these acts more often than not, his as yet unknown creative outlet left unfulfilled.  During these turbulent times, young Reznor found work programming synthesizers and MIDI in a small Cleveland studio, and it was here that Nine Inch Nails first began to take shape.  A twenty-something Reznor toiled by day at the controls of the studio, but was given free reign at night by the studio owner.  Reznor slowly taught himself the complicated MIDI applications that would allow him to sample, mix, and develop various sounds.  Being free of the typical collaborating (see 'meddling') band mates, Reznor took his time and immersed himself utterly in his work, preferring the isolation.  He was free to express his feelings through an electronic format that was soothing and grating, soft and hard, quiet and raucous.  Being only an amateur musician at the time, Trent Reznor approached his work from the listeners point of view, and developed a work that allowed the listener to hear someone else express their innermost emotions and pain, but in an entirely unique and unusual way.  The result was a collection of raw, turbulent and brutally honest tracks.  The origin of the name Nine Inch Nails has been widely speculated over the years.  Some argue it refers to the length of a coffin nail, while more imaginative souls liken it to the size of Trent Reznor's phallus.  Rather boringly, however, it has no profound meaning.  After tossing around 200 monikers for several weeks, Reznor found that Nine Inch Nails kept ringing in his head.  He has also quipped that it looked great in print, was easy to abbreviate, and "it's a lot cooler name than Trent Reznor."  "It's a curse trying to come up with band names," says Reznor.  It was about this time that Trent Reznor began to shop his demo out to some smaller independent labels.  The 80's were coming to a close, and the music industry was undergoing a subtle shift in trends.  In the summer of 1988, Reznor cautiously sent out about ten, three-track demos to small, independent labels, simply looking for a single 12-inch deal so that he might hone his craft.  He was not yet fully aware of what Nine Inch Nails was, or what direction it was going to take, and he was reluctant to get involved with a label that would want to smooth out his sound into a polished, more palatable brand of pop.  So it was with surprise and some trepidation no doubt, when Reznor received offers from virtually every one of the labels he had approached.  It was at this point that Reznor realized he was on to something.  Trent Reznor settled on TVT records, a record label more commonly known to market albums consisting of TV jingles rather than avant-garde, pseudo-Industrial music.  Nevertheless, Reznor immersed himself in the deal, working with a number of producers on what would be Nine Inch Nails' debut album.  One notable producer included Adrian Sherwood (Depeche Mode, Ministry, KMFDM), who mixed the lead single "Down in It" for the as-yet unreleased Pretty Hate Machine.  Sherwood and Reznor communicated solely over the phone and Sherwood actually mixed the track in London.  The two would never actually meet face to face.  It was this mix that would find its way onto Pretty Hate Machine, as opposed to Reznor's original version, despite Reznor's protests.  While Reznor appreciated Sherwood's mix, it was radically different from his own version, and he protested in vain with TVT to have it kept off the album, but the label would not relent.  This was perhaps the first sign of sour times ahead for TVT and Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor also worked with the legendary Flood, whom he had originally wanted to produce Pretty Hate Machine in its entirety, but due to scheduling constraints and prior commitments, this had become impossible.  "I liked Flood because he's the opposite of Sherwood. He's very transparent. You don't say, 'Hey, that sounds like Flood,'" says Reznor of the legendary producer.  Flood, of Depeche Mode and U2's Achtung Baby fame, was nevertheless able to contribute in a small way.  Several other producers were also added to a growing list, including John Fryer (Love & Rockets, Cocteau Twins) and Keith LeBlanc (Tackhead, Maffia).  It was time that Nine Inch Nails took their act on the road.  Trent Reznor was faced with an obstacle, however.  Because he had recorded Pretty Hate Machine entirely alone ("Nine Inch Nails is Trent Reznor" the album jacket flatly proclaims), Reznor had to assemble a cast of characters to bring Nine Inch Nails' music alive on stage.  So, Reznor gathered some musicians about him, and ambitiously played a few dates opening for the legendary Skinny Puppy.  It was an intimidating time by Reznor's own account.  He felt they weren't nearly as intense live as he wanted them, so after the small tour, he ushered his live band out the door, and collected a new crew around him.  He intentionally looked for young, malleable musicians who would be less likely to voice their artistic opinion and more likely to bow to young Reznor's direction.  And so, Reznor was joined by Chris Vrenna on drums, Richard Patrick (whose brother is Robert Patrick, who played the T-1000 on Terminator 2: Judgement Day) on guitar, and David Haymes on keyboards.  In the spring of 1989, Nine Inch Nails embarked on a tour in support of Pretty Hate Machine, opening for the Jesus and Mary Chain, and quickly followed it up with a spring tour opening for Peter Murphy.  While NIN were moderately well received for fans of Jesus and Mary Chain, Murphy fans were not so forgiving.  Playing small theatres and college auditoriums, the steroid-pumping jocks and Bauhaus-fanatics did not take well to NIN and their angst-ridden set.  It was not until an Atlanta show when Reznor pelted the audience with cold pizza before they actually received some semblance of acceptance.  After throwing corn starch on the audience, smashing a guitar, toppling the drum set, and storming offstage, Reznor was amazed to find the gathered Georgia crowd loved them.  "Forget the music, as soon as they got abused, that was it.  We outsold Peter Murphy on T-shirts," Reznor has said about the show.  Nine Inch Nails would also go on to release their first music video at about this time, the lead track "Down in It."  Produced by H-Gun, the Chicago group who were also responsible for Al Jourgensen-related projects like Ministry and the Revolting Cocks, the video did not initially pass MTV standards and was edited.  Towards the end of the video, Trent Reznor is simply lying on the ground, covered in corn starch, supposedly dead.  One does not see how Reznor 'dies,' nor are there any gruesome details indicating how he might have died, but it was still too much for MTV.  "That implies suicide, and we can't have that on MTV," Reznor has said sarcastically about the cut-job on the video, "but we can have Cher's naked ass."  With the breaking success of Pretty Hate Machine, supported by the albeit edited video rotation on MTV, as well as the underground success of their second single and video, "Head Like A Hole," Nine Inch Nails were beginning to gain steam and gain some notoriety.  So much so, in fact, that NIN were approached by Perry Farrell of Jane's Addition, who was putting together a very eclectic cast of characters for a festival tour labeled Lollapalooza.  Lollapalooza was the brainchild of Farrell, and consisted of a touring package of a wide variety of musical styles, while at the same time offering a venue and voice for political debate.  And so it was that Nine Inch Nails, now joined by James Woolley on keyboards, were squeezed into the middle of a seven-band bill, immediately followed by Ice-T and preceding Living Color.  Nine Inch Nails proved to be a wildcard on the tour, and touring with Lollapalooza undoubtedly set the main foundation for Nine Inch Nails' huge success.  Fans who had never heard of NIN became immediately enraptured when a corn-starch coated Trent Reznor took the stage, smashing guitars, keyboards, and band mates alike.  Rather than banking the pay checks that they were receiving for their performances, Nine Inch Nails instead put aside only a small kitty and invested the rest into ten guitars per performance.  Ten guitars scheduled strictly for destruction.  And so, each night when Nine Inch Nails took the stage before an audience of people who had never heard of them, Reznor would do his best to destroy each and everyone said instruments, whether it be by smashing them over the stage or his own band mates.  James Woolley found this out the hard way at the performance in San Francisco, California, when a piece of keyboard, destroyed by Reznor, flew up and hit him in the head, drawing a torrent of blood.  Oblivious, Reznor played/thrashed on, until a stage hand alerted him to the fact that medics were on the way to tend to the injured Woolley.  Guitarist Richard Patrick suffered a similar fate in Boston, Massachusetts, where Reznor tackled him over some monitors, leaving Patrick writhing in agony.  This was just after Reznor had soaked the amps, cables, and monitors in water, of course.  Fans at Lollapalooza had no idea what they were witnessing, but they damn well knew an exciting act when they saw it.  Nine Inch Nails' and Trent Reznor's antics went so far as to draw the attention of then mega-rock star Axl Rose, frontman for Guns N' Roses.  He invited Reznor and mates to open for them on the European leg of their tour, including an opening slot at the legendary Wembley Stadium.  NIN accepted, though they would grow to regret it.  Reznor went full-tilt in their first performance, "but by the second one my tail was between my legs," Reznor says.  Greasy-haired, mullet-wearing metal heads apparently could not digest Nine Inch Nails so-called 'synth' sound, and Reznor and company found themselves ducking cheap whiskey and beer bottles thrown at NIN in appreciation.  "It's one of those things when you think it might be a funny idea then you realize, when you're up there, maybe this ain't so great," said Reznor.  Needless to say, Reznor turned down Rose's offer to open for the final American leg of the Gunners tour.  After nearly three years of touring, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails finally decided to take a break.  Reznor wanted to begin recording anew, working solely with Flood, but he had come to realize that Nine Inch Nails' relationship with TVT Records head Steve Gottlieb and the label was at an impasse.  The next several years would find Reznor engaged in a bitter legal dispute to free himself from the constraint of the absolute antithesis of artistic freedom, while at the same time recording new, even more angst-ridden music in secret.  Nine Inch Nails had been born and unleashed upon an unsuspecting world mired in musical mediocrity; but at the same time, their future was shaky at best. xBuBzx

						   My   Esteem   Problem   Part One   When I was little, and from what I can remember, I really quite hated myself. I used to think that If I didn't exist that: "who the fuck is gunna care about me?". I think I must have only been around 6 or 7 at the time and I've only just in the last week or so managed to figure out that it was this and other factors that has caused my problems through all stages of school and life I have been through. This could have been down to a couple of things I guess:  1. No siblings of my own age, 2. How hard it was for me to make friends in general when I was little, 3. The spoiling, lack of true discipline by Mum and Dad, 4. Or I could just be making a rash over judgment on the whole thing, and it could all be in my head.  I tend (or am trying to do more so) to disagree strongly with the latter as It has no relevance or evidence, and personally I think that the answer could be a mixture of all the other 3 alternatives on offer as they are all reliable, viable et al to everything about me. Both my sibling are over 30 and left home when I was 6 and the time they were living at home, weren't here much at all anyway. Being as my parents are quite  old  for parents aswell, I was quite lonely at an early age, and never really encouraged to go out and make friends much either. Because of this perhaps, or possibly because of some obscure biological reason, making friends was never really an easy thing for me. Sure I had some. I wasn't Billy no friends definitely, but I had a nack for over-reacting and being a selfish brat.    Part Two Tomorrow   xBuBzx

						   So finally, after two quarreling, mouth ulcer infested, blood skewing years of this mechanical animal inhabiting the large majority or my mouth against its will, suddenly, with a mighty desperation it must be said, let go of its reign in a Saddam-Hussein-esque fashion.  Good riddance I most definitely say. When the bloody thing actually came out and the concrete shaver had done its job, my tentative tongue checked the damage and possible remains. I must say that the thing did its job ok. It's got more of a "semi-circular" feel to it than ever before and eating the ultimate orgasmic cookies from the canteen was a taste, sight, well just general experience to behold for the ages (in my view at least).On bad side I can see thus far is that I'm going to have to start brushing regularly again, but that's not worries for what I've got back - a fully natural, non-war infested set of teeth, WOOOO!!!  So nehoo, I was in quite a lot of boredom last night, and as the Net seemed to be less than the time filling source that it usually is, I sat down and watched a program about ANGRY PISSED OF CHEF Gordon Ramsey, and watch him try to turn a young, awful, obnoxious chef from Yorkshire into something that can produce half edible food, and the program made for pretty good viewing to be honest, helped somewhat by my liking all things where the central character gets his finger yanked out of his own arse.  The Universities also came out to play yesterday at college and just for the hell of it, I managed to pick up certain prospectus' on Oxford, Cambridge and Thames Valley et al. The day, although on the very long side, came out to be very useful and some things  were really interesting, like the gap year presentation, and most things there made me open my eyes to the advantages of them in the long term. xBuBzx

						     Korn - Seed    Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away. I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay. I feel so lost within - pressured, I'm headed for that day. Just one thought in my head, really. Do I need this fame?   Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be. Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be. Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak, Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way? It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame.   Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be. Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be. Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried, something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine. So I see this face and I realize it's mine.   I feel the rattle...   So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine. So I see this face and I realize it's mine.   I feel the rattle...   Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be. Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.

						   Even though its been one hell of a week already, God thank weekends. Should be extended by an extra day no question. Well of to a party in Molesey with Jen, Rach and possibly Dan. Should be good, last time I went to a party there I came home with hickeys and I can vividly remember the elaborate pulling between Rachael and Frances (Never laughed so much in my life apart from when Paul tried to chat up a 90 year old woman in the swan once I suppose). Saturday is still a blur really apart from Chelsea playing Manure at Old Trafford. Quite confident that we will be pissed of and lay the final nail in United's season. Well a good end to the week in football terms would be gladly welcome.   Have fun wHeReVeR yOuR gOiNg. xBuBzx

						   After yesterdays abysmal event (which we shall never again utter) I'm feeling in a relaxed mood and quite tranquil. Maybe because there's no agitation or nerves (well except tonight maybe as the mighty Tooting and Mitcham are in some obscure cup final which I'm going to with Ian - COME ON YOU TOOTS YEH!!) about football anymore and the fact I've decided that my Christian theories are fairly useless and so I'll stop relying on signs from God (read into what I would have done if Chelsea beat Monaco last night) and just go for things on my own terms and accord. Hopefully it will work; hopefully.  Was also thinking as you may have gathered I tend to do it quite a fair bit, to try to sway every open minded music lovers, if they don't already, onto Nine Inch Nails. I copied a while back, one almighty CD with 12 of there best tracks on them and it tingles my spine every time I listen to it. Just marvelous. Ciao children. xBuBzx

						   We lost but, I think on the whole I knew we were going to lose form the start after what happened in the 1st leg. Anyway got home and was in a thoroughly depressed and suicidal mood (like every other Chelsea fan) but got speaking to Jen and I managed to utter some laughter (Jen often seems to make me laugh). So of to bed now to decipher the next phase of the Chelsea world domination plan. Hoorah. xBuBzx

As sad as this looks as well, this is what I think the team will (or should) be tonight:                                                              Cudicini  Johnson                 Terry                                                       Gallas                                    Bridge         Geremi                   Parker                                                                                                  Cole                                                                                            Lampard                                 Gudjohnson                                                                                            Crespo   I think we will snatch it, but overall I'm not sure. It can be done and if we play to our maximum (like I hope and expect), we'll do it. I'm probably going to the Shed bar at Stamford Bridge and be very drunk, so I won't remember if we loose. Hoooorahhh. I also plan to call quite a few people strangely and have a wonderful drink fuelled celebration over the wireless with them. I've also decided that (as odd as this sounds also) if we win, it will be a sign, and that I should take a few more risks than I usually do on a few things. Don't know why but I've decided to stop hating myself and appreciate life and stop presuming that others will not be there for me and wouldn't take a chance with me.  Oh and revise also lol.  I was thinking last night also, how above virtually anything, football rallies the emotions. Forget life, depression et al; a game where 22 men try to kick a small synthetic ball into a rectangular goal can evoke the strongest of emotions in people. Chelsea is my only religion, and when times haven't been so good for me I've always known, however well they're doing, that I can rely on them unquestionably for some relief. This is why I love them so dearly as I do. The love I have for them is like the one you give to your children, and as over-exaggerated as this sounds, it's the only way I can describe it, and in the most truest form. xBuBzx

						   I had a truly memorable and marvelous argument with someone on the Heatham boards, something which I try to steer clear of to be honest, but it was against someone with gladly a more than adequate knowledge of how to express his language, so I was more than glad to be part of it :  urlLink Easily the best net argument of my life  (my nickname being matty . . . . of course (-: ).  Anyway I had a loooooong sociology conference at College and I'm getting more and more nervous about the match on Wednesday as the match ebbs ever closer *sigh*.  Also, you must agree the Weather is having one almighty period isn't it? God rain one minute, sunshine the next, what the hells next - snow with sun and tornados in the mix? xBuBzx

						     Swimming In The Haze: Part Two - The Broken Phase    Here's part two of a net biography of my favorite band Nine Inch Nails:  Rock superstardom: the tired cliche that is the very crux and irony that confronts rock stars on the verge of greatness. To write, compose, and perform music that defies the establishment in order to gain greater notoriety and eventually become part of said establishment which you must intrinsically scorn, this is the vicious circle that despite their greatest efforts, all stars and starlets with even a scintilla of a conscience must struggle to come to terms with. So it was in 1991 when Trent Reznor found himself precariously balanced on the edge of greatness.  Having recently released arguably the biggest selling Industrial album of all time (for the time), Pretty Hate Machine, and having wrapped up the hugely successful stint on the now legendary Lollapalooza tour, Reznor found himself wondering what the next move was to take his fledgling Nine Inch Nails to higher levels, despite the fact that they were already hurtling along with new momentum.  Prior to embarking on the Lollapalooza tour, Reznor had made it clear to TVT Records, his first record label which released NIN's debut album and subsequent singles, that Nine Inch Nails would not release another record under their watch.  Their meddling with Reznor's musical artistry on Pretty Hate Machine had enraged Reznor so much that he could no longer fathom working with anyone who would compromise the quality of his art without his say in the matter.  In addition, Pretty Hate Machine's success had made Reznor a producer in demand, and TVT resented and often attempted to thwart Reznor's numerous side-projects with bands such as Pigface and 1000 Homo DJs.  TVT, smelling the green resulting from the critical acclaim and widespread success of Nine Inch Nails' electric performances on Lollapalooza, was not ready to allow their budding star to walk away so easily, despite the fact that then TVT Records chief Steve Gottlieb admitted to causing the rift.  "Our relationship got dysfunctional.  I obviously let Trent down.  We're talking about the guy who wrote the lyric, "I'd rather die, than give you control!"  John Malm, Jr., Reznor's long-time manager, has said of that period, "Trent would have mowed lawns rather than make another record for TVT."  And so began a several years-long legal battle that is nearly legendary in the recording industry.  The chess match and legalmaneuveringg caused by Nine Inch Nails attempting to break away from TVT forced Reznor to actually record in secret.  Along with renowned producer Flood, Reznor fled to Miami Beach, among other locations, where he and Flood worked guardedly and secretly on the follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine.  Reznor had become bitterly jaded and disillusioned with the music industry, and admits to adopting a "snotty, elitist mentality, you're not cool enough to like my band, don't buy my records."  He "wanted to make a 'fuck you' record" to prove that he wasn't a sell-out, and also to reflect his general animosity towards life during the TVT fiasco.  Two years after it had begun, Nine Inch Nails' feud with TVT Records concluded with Jimmy Iovine, president of Interscope Records, actually buying out TVT in order to acquire NIN.  At first, Reznor was furious, seeing Nine Inch Nails' sale akin to being traded on a slave market, and has referenced it as such in past interviews.  Part of the deal, however, was the set-up of Reznor's own label independent of Interscope, to be called Nothing, that would allow Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails total artistic freedom.  Nothing Records' inaugural release was Broken, a harsh and angry six-track mini-record that was the result of Reznor's clandestine recording sessions during Nine Inch Nails' break from TVT Records.  While Reznor expected the switch to a major label would be perceived as a sell-out, thus alienating much of NIN's fans, Broken, which was intended as nothing more than a middle finger to pretty much everyone, garnered critical and commercial success.  So much so, that Broken was awarded no less than two Grammy's, to the surprise of both the recording industry in general and Reznor himself.  Broken was immediately followed up by Fixed, an allegorical indication of his transition from one record label to another.  Fixed was another six-track mini-album, which was comprised of the re-mixed and re-worked tracks from Broken.  Reznor took full advantage of his newfound freedom to work with other artists on Fixed, and Peter Christopherson of Coil and J.G. Thirwell, a.k.a. Clint Ruin, contributed their own unique interpretations of Nine Inch Nails' songs.  Fixed would mark the first Nine Inch Nails re-mix album, and this fondness for releasing re-mixed and varied interpretations, both by himself and other contributors, would continue throughout Reznor's career.  While Reznor's new Nothing Records set up official shop in Cleveland, Reznor found himself spending more and more time in New Orleans, a city fast becoming a retreat for extreme rockers looking to get off the radar for a brief respite.  Being so far removed from the West Coast, Hollywood intensity and fast-paced, urban sprawl of New York, New Orleans was a place where up and coming rock stars could go relatively unnoticed.  After a period of recuperation and reflection, getting used to the new freedom being enjoyed under Interscope, and the satisfaction of knowing the commercial success from Broken and Fixed, made on his own terms, Reznor was ready to begin work on the next, full-length Nine Inch Nails record.  He had a lot to live up to.  Nine Inch Nails' raucous tours, eclectic sound, and maelstrom of rumours and interesting 'pickles' that Reznor seemed to always land himself in had spawned a devout, cult-like following of fans.  Pretty Hate Machine was fast-approaching more than a million copies in sales in the USA, and the album was now consistently garnering favourable review and acclaim across the pond in the UK.  Having a solid idea for the direction of Nine Inch Nails, Reznor went shopping for a location in which he could hibernate while giving birth to his next musical creation.  After checking out several properties in the Los Angeles region, Reznor selected a big, beautiful home with a spectacular view of Los Angeles, and with a very reasonable price tag.  Reznor signed the deal and began to move in.  It would later be spectacularly revealed that said house was actually the location of the famous Charles Manson murders where Sharon Tate, wife of director Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby), and four guests were gruesomely butchered in a bizarre, cult act the likes of which shocked America as badly as Hiroshima or President John F. Kennedy's assassination.  After finding out about his new, albeit temporary residence's history, Reznor remained unfazed, and elected to remain, even warming up to the place for the added, spookily cool aura it cast over recording sessions.  At least this is what we are led to believe.  This amazing revelation would have to be based on the assumption that Reznor, his agents, friends, and family did not clue into the history of said property during the course of acquiring it.  In addition, Trent Reznor would have been four years old when the Manson murders occurred.  Again, this was a murder/media event that was totally unprecedented in American history, and was the focal point of the media for months, years, and now even decades after the fact.  Further, the trials went on for years, and given ReznorÂs documented and rather obvious penchant for an interest in all things spooky, the odds are very good that Reznor knew exactly what property he was buying.  But why hide that fact?  First of all, perhaps no one denied anything.  The media would undoubtedly have attempted to contact Reznor's management or Reznor himself, but a lack of confirmation would have been at the mercy of the journalist's creative whim, and simply added to the larger myth.  Additionally, perhaps Reznor simply found it easier not having to explain why someone could possibly have an interest in such a place from a personal point of view, as the media would undoubtedly have twisted and perceived the explanation as nothing more than a publicity stunt; better to remain mysterious and dark, albeit ignorant, rather than an attention-seeking wannabe.  Rumours also dictate that the walls of one particular room still bore the infamous blood stained word "pig" scrawled on it.  This is simply not true.  While the word "pig" was written in blood, it was not inside the room that Reznor would in fact make the brains of his recording operation, and affectionately nickname Le Pig, or even in the house at all, for that matter.  In actuality, the word "pig" was on the front door of the house.  And even putting that fact aside, is it really plausible to believe that after all the investigation and trials, and subsequent renovations of the house to restore it to a condition suitable for sale, that the word "pig" would be left, in blood no less, on the wall/door of the house?  Highly unlikely, dear reader.  But it sure makes for more interesting journalism, doesn't it?  So, while Reznor claimed that the house's history did not bother him, it undoubtedly affected the mood and atmosphere of the recording sessions.  Reznor again exercised his freedom under Interscope and Nothing by calling on select musicians.  Notwithstanding his now staple producer, Flood, Reznor also called on Adrian Belew, the guitar legend behind many David Bowie masterpieces.  Stephen Perkins, drummer for Jane's Addiction laid down some percussion, and Alan Moulder was brought in to lend his considerable expertise at the mixing board.  Reznor recognized that a pattern had begun to emerge with Nine Inch Nails, and he "didn't want to box NIN into a corner, where everything had to be faster and harder than the last record."  Instead, Reznor wanted the next album "to be a departure from Broken...one ultra-fast chunk of death...This time I wanted to make an album that went in ten different directions, but was all united somehow."  Reznor had decided on somewhat of a concept album, where the record would have a unifying theme.  Where Pretty Hate Machine laid bare raw emotion, and where Broken and Fixed focused specifically on anger, Reznor turned inwards on himself once again, and dug deeper into his own psyche.  The theme of the record would follow the descent of an individual through their own inner revelations as they strip away every aspect of their very selves, and scrutinize the basic moral code that makes up society as a whole today: love, hate, religion, relationships, sex, violence, and vices as seen under a psychological microscope.  Examining every aspect to the finest detail, Reznor wrought a bleak, wallowing descent into introspection that would become the title for Nine Inch Nails' newest opus: The Downward Spiral.    Never had Reznor delved so deeply into his personal life, and The Downward Spiral represents a thorough purging for Reznor, to the point where Reznor has openly admitted he "out-bleaked" even himself and hopes to never again reach that point of despair.  Rather than the all-out aural assault that was Broken, The Downward Spiral was a haunting project that deftly combined texture and mood to evoke nerve-wrenching emotion.  Always one to admire full-bodied albums such as Pink Floyd's The Wall, Reznor attempted to create a record that required the listener sit down and absorb the album front to back, several times, before they began to come to the revelations behind the seeming caterwaul of sound.  He admired albums that slowly revealed themselves, and in the long run contributed to one's "musical vocabulary."  Reznor also recognized that he may aled the very un-radio friendly lyric "I want to fuck you like an animal" would, surprisingly, become their biggest single ever.  The track, edited to a friendlier, profanity-free version, received heavy rotation on the airwaves and huge underground success in clubs all over the world.  The accompanying video, directed by auteur Mark Romanek, closely paralleled the shocking content of "Closer" and hit the viewer hard with images of decapitated pigs' heads, crucified monkeys, naked flesh, and Reznor spinning maniacally out of control.  An extended version, "Closer to God" would later be released featuring various interpretations and some additional tracks.  Nine Inch Nails were a permanent success.  Trent Reznor had toiled and worked his way up from gopher at a local recording studio to a mainstream artist garnering critical acclaim from both established and newfound fans, and critics the world over.  The Downward Spiral represented a pinnacle of achievement in both Reznor's life, and in the history of music.  By looking into himself and laying bare all the deep and darkest secrets of his soul, Reznor had inadvertently connected with millions of others who exist on a common emotional plane.  The connection had to once again become physical.  After a three-year hiatus from touring, it was time for Trent Reznor to assemble hiser", a haunting piece of music that featured the very un-radio friendly lyric "I want to fuck you like an animal" would, surprisingly, become their biggest single ever.

Garnering a great deal of their initial attention and subsequent reputation from the live Nine Inch Nails experience, and now boasting a massive new fan base, Reznor's next challenge would be delivering that now legendary stage show to Nine Inch Nails' new and rabid fans worldwide. xBuBzx

						     The Ego, The Id, And the Ænema    The primary role of art has always been not just as an outlet for the artist, but to comment on society, its people, and its values.  Whether said art comments on the society in which it is displayed or an alternate society in order to bring enlightenment, artists typically have something to say, and their art is their voice.  Music is certainly no exception to this rule, and the fundamental tenet of the more alternative vein of music which we, dear reader, typically align ourselves with, is most definitely to comment on society.  But what is the basis for this commentary?  Without question, psychology.  It is the basis of the artist's voice, and psychology often works not only in predictable ways, but also in lesser known ways.  Most of us who have opposable thumbs and the ability to read have heard of Dr. Sigmund Freud, who postulated and theorized quite literally the basis of most of modern-day psychology as we know it.  One core theory of Freud's concerns the Id, the Superego, and the Ego.  These widely accepted psychological models are more prevalent in modern-day music than one might realize, as they together are more or less present in each and every one of us.  Freud tells us the Id is the primitive unconscious consisting of fundamental drives.  The Id is irrational, impulsive, and seeks immediate gratification with no consideration for what is realistically possible, socially desirable, or morally acceptable.  It is governed by the pleasure principle – the unregulated search for gratification, especially sexual, physical, and emotional pleasures – to be experienced here and now without concern for the consequences.  The Id is self-centered, and looks inward only.  Certainly, much of modern day music has sexual, physical, and emotional overtones, but most of the modern, bubble-gum pop music heard on Top 40 radio lacks the intensity that one would imagine is involved in 'primitive' and 'impulsive' decisions.  More alternative artists such as Nine Inch Nails, however, certainly embody the Id, and go so far as to embrace it.  Nine Inch Nails' abrasive and eclectic sound, searing vocals, and indisputably raw emotion, both recorded and live, most definitely make tangible Freud’s theory of the Id.  And much of the lyrical content of Nine Inch Nails is certainly inwardly focused, centering on one's journey through self-exploration.  With the yin, there must always be a yang.  Freud also postulated the Superego, or storehouse of one's values, including moral attitudes learned from society.  The Superego is one's conscience, consisting of that inner voice of 'oughts' and 'should nots'.  The Superego also includes the Ego Ideal – an individual's view of the kind of person one should strive to become.  The Superego is often in conflict with Id – while the Id wants to do what feels good, the Superego operates on the morality principle and insists on doing what is right.  The Superego looks not towards the inner self, as the Id does, but instead focuses on the outer world and its morality.  The Superego is most definitely present in standard pop music, but to a much lesser extent in the more hardcore veins.  While Britney Spears is happy to package her ass for sale on the cover of her records, yet wouldn't be caught dead in the nude anywhere, at anytime (despite what those alluring pop-up ads tell you), Raymond Watts (of Pig/Watts/KMFDM fame) goes the extra mile and pulls his cock out onstage (I know...sadly, I was front row and witness to it).  One could certainly attribute Watts' dick tricks to the Id's victory over the Superego, and Britney's reluctance to bare all, despite the fact 90% has been bared already, indicates instead the triumph of the Superego.  This unconscious factor theorized by Freud is present in everyone, but in artists such as Britney, it is simply more dominant.  To round out Freud's theory nicely, he also theorized the Ego – the reality-based aspect that arbitrates conflict between Id impulses and Superego demands.  The Ego, Freud says, consist of one's beliefs about the causes and consequences of behaviour.  Governed by the reality principle, which puts reasonable choices before pleasurable demands, the Ego arranges compromise between the conflicting Id and Superego.  Thus, the Ego is the arbitrator, or seeker of common ground.  Marilyn Manson, anyone?  While Nine Inch Nails' typically brutal, all-out aural assault is influenced primarily by the Id, and Britney Spears unwillingness to shows us every square inch of her breasts is controlled by the Superego, Manson's music adheres more to the Ego.  Marilyn Manson take their role as artists seriously, and as such have a lot to say about society.  But rather than simply focus on the pleasure-based principles (rap's continuous yearning for 'booty'), or rather than play it safe by performing easily digestible, zero-to-say music (pop's continuous yearning for um...erm...bright lights, tight pants, and a Pepsi sponsorship?), Marilyn Manson analyze society, and comment on it by providing solutions, albeit rather extreme and unusual alternatives ("light a candle for the sinners / set the world on fire").  Thus, Manson embrace their Ego, rather than letting their Id or Superego dominate, and as a result enjoy more controversy and media attention than artists who allow their Id and Superego to hold the reins.  Beyond Freud's basic structure of personality, several post-Freudian descendants expanded on his basic theories of the unconscious.  One such psychologist is Carl Jung, a student of Freud.  He greatly expanded on the conception of the unconscious.  For Jung, the unconscious was not limited to an individual's life experiences, but was also filled with fundamental psychological truths shared by the entire human race.  Jung believed the concept of collective unconscious predisposes us all to react to certain stimuli in the same way and consists of archetypes associated with an instinctive tendency to feel and think about it or experience it in a special way.  These archetypes, known as animus in the case of male archetypes, and anima in the case of female archetypes, are primitive symbolic representations of a particular experience or object.  And these archetypes, both male and female, are present in each and every one of us, and guide us daily in our actions, says Jung.  Now these are relatively big words and theories for the general population, and you would have a hard time convincing this author of evidence of this concept to a great degree in Christina Aguilera's latest offering.  Attend a Tool concert, however, and it's a completely different story.  Tool’s heavy, prog-rock sound, laced with complex lyrics, undulating imagery, and surreal art suggests just the opposite: these are well-read believers in psychology and Jung's basic tenets, and their live show is evidence of this even more than their deliciously intricate records.  Large screens typically overhanging the stage continually bombard the audience with imagery naturally encouraging the audience to unconsciously reach deeper into the collective unconscious in seek of wisdom and fundamental truths.  Spoken word clips from Timothy Leary and other avant-garde artists emulate the collective unconscious.  And might I remind the reader of one of Tool's more popular records, Ænima?  A cross-breed of the psychological term 'anima' and the considerably less pleasant (at least for most) 'enema', Ænima is Tool’s humorous play on words that parallels the anima’s continual presence in all of us in conjunction with a collective mindfuck.  While each and every individual on the planet have in theory all of the aforementioned psychological factors at work in their subconscious, the artists described above simply lean towards one or another more directly.  Yet they all are present in our thought processes, the Id and Superego engaged in an eternal tug-of-war, while the Ego maintains balance.  And hovering above all of these processes, says Jung, are the male and female archetypes in every one of us guiding us all in a similar fashion.  So, the next time you're spinning a disc, look past the glitzy album cover and the latex encased body, and inwardly challenge the musician to speak to you on these basic psychological planes.  You might be surprised at what you hear, or perhaps what you don't. xBuBzx

						   Interesting new feature on blog world I found (as most of you who have a blog probably have) is the link box you can put at the top. So I decided to treat you wonderful people to a piece of renaissance art, which can be magnificently viewed upon clicking the link on the "Oh there your mates!!!" part (another of Ian's random sayings encase your wondering). Thinking of Ian as well, he said he would start a Blog of his own soon which I look forward to in mesmeric anticipation.  I'm yet to find out how to do the links to interesting and wonderful links although hopefully tonight they'll be sorted (Jen  WILL  help/do that for me [Danke LOVE YOU!!! lol]).  Nehoo Been an average so so sort of day except this morning when I was having my eyes tested (6 month check up, and nothing to do with the *ahem*  mowing down of a child incident ) and discovered these amazing set of geeky old retro type of glasses (yer you know they're cool   really  ) were - wait for it - Â£120!!!!!!!! They're begged and swayed me though with they're powerful methods of persuasion (well just a cookie really) and now I await the ultimate-cool retro geek eyesight YAY.  Besides that I'm loudly annoying the townies (always one of my favorite past times with my excessively loud Metallica and my even more excessive ignorance to there complaints. Hoorah: now where's some food I'm hungry. Well must be of to Psychology soon enough so ciao for now my little one's. xBuBzx

						   Well all in all I haven't quite figured out how to work out the new blog layout - but I guess I'll figure it out eventually.  Well it was a really shitty type of week which gradually got worse as the week went on and on. Never the less - this is not last week and I really think things are on the up. I have a spontaneous confidence streak to do with my esteem (I'll write the second part to  the esteem thing  soon I promise) and I reckon, despite some odd setbacks that it's going rather well and better than expected. Maybe (in my warped imagination) it will lead to some kinkual shenanigans if that makes any sense with this one person I must have loved and liked, on and of for God knows how many years. Well I hope so anyway, as does the ensuing draw which will be evidently present. OOh I'm definetely going to write some erotica about that one mwahahahahahahaha. Ciao xBuBzx

						   Yesterday I was in a spontaneous (crazy) sort of way so I decided to castrate my hair (on my head  not  my  pubic area  *rolls eyes*). I guess I was in need of something to just "spark" or "happen", and so I decided my hair was the perfect compromise. Nethertheless, it's amazing what unwanted attention the "anti-follicle" receive. As much as people like to rub and poke my head, I found disturbingly, a new strange (and hopefully not mental) side to my friend Suzanne. SHE DREW A NAZI SIGN ON MY TEMPLE |-:. So I'm not sure quite what to make of that or any of the other strange behaviour I have come across today (will get considering It's only  half past FUCKING 1 )  Neho, I think I've officially got fed up of the love torment friends decide that I actually like to hear, about their girlfriends and boyfriends "  problems  ". It's hard enough being a permanently celibate as I am, without having to hear other people's un-gratitude about the fact, despite the problems et al, that they actually have someone in there life that is actually prepared to call them their own. Maybe, I don't know, they should decide to think the whole relationship through before deciding to interrupt my sad but contempt bond with the official Chelsea management *sigh*. Oh well I know they don't have bad intentions, well  most  of them anyway, so, well, hmmm, I'm of to the shitter.... xBuBzx

Well If you've ever seen what pictures I keep (non-pornographic I assure you) on my PC then you will know what oddities I'll be displaying in the coming month. Think of the last two as a tame introduction mon ami.  Neho, it's the oracle's 91st birthday on the weekend, which means somebody going to have to either buy 91 candles (heaven above) or one hell of a present (which will probably be me judging on the family's prejudices against the young members of it, namely me and Harry exploitation). Poor little Ethel (who solely endorses the Granny Smith apples lol) won't know what to do with all the generosity and gifts. Will she   drown   (literally) in them? Will she think due to her ever (  bless her  ) deteriorating brain, think that the gift rap paper is  in fact  the present? Wow it sounds like a roller coaster ride of emotional shocks and shenanigans; and I  only  wish I was there to see it that's all *rolls eyes*.  Happy birthday Gran, and have a good day. xBuBzx

						   Well seeing as I haven't really posted anything on here on any real literal meaning to do with the daily ramblings of my life recently, I thought it just time I gave a visit to you poor neglected souls.  Life's really been in tandem with the weather recently, and not much could make me feel any more contempt at things. I hit the ground running exam wise, and I've finally got the will power to believe I can achieve things this summer i.e. lose weight, work vast quantities of overtime, and gain some confidence. Getting into revision really started this whole thing of, and now, safe in the knowledge that I'll be of to Cardiff to witness the great war between Ian and Dan (Palace and West Ham to you and I respectively), everything's just feels like yayish excitement.  I'm just really keen to do well this year, and explore hopefully new cultures et al, however, that may not be possible considering the furthest I'll probably get from home is work. Nevertheless, this won't dampen my spirits.  Hell I even feel like doing a jog some-time soon. Oh no wait . . . The sofa is still vastly more appealing *sigh*. Hmmmm wonder what's on the box tonight? xBuBzx

						   I wouldn't say bitter/sweet weekend as such but it was more like norm/sensual if that awakens any sense in your mind of what I'm waffling on about.  Friday basically I slept.  Rare  Very rare. Not many people know it but I'm an insomniac. So it was a good thing really.  Saturday was beautiful though. I stayed over at Annas (heya my gorgeous German darling of a scandal) and watched this kick ass film called basketball diaries with Leonardo Di Caprio, who I know gets much flack for his lack of presence, but God he played it well. Anyway after that spent the time until about 5 in the morning talking, hugging and "foot fondling" (yay we inventned it) and I told her I loved her, which I still do, right to this day. I'd die for that girl if I had to, and I just wish one day she was mine. Maybe one day.  nehoo - just a message to the rival hell like enemy blog from Mortlake - I'll get you back dammit grrrrr with a wonderfully god liek plague of net locusts onto your blog (-:

						   "I do apologise about the over rash generalisations there, but it was fun in all senses, and I stand by what I say. It's not your right either to say who can post what and what about. Even when Dean was being an ass on this site, he still had the right to speak his mind, and no one could deny him that.   I realize I'm not Gods gift, unlike yourself "luv", and If I thought I was then I'd be a million times more different to what I am.  Now I'm not saying that I totally agree with either being a townie or a grundger on here, but I would not call grundgers cowards, just because they won't fight other people. Fighting has never been a way to earn respect, its only ruling by fear and intimidation, and as townies are for no reasons what so ever picking on grundgers etc, what is there crime by speaking there mind on here about it and for sake of argument even if it was, would that be a worse crime than violence against anyone?   Surely if your as open minded and non-judgmental as your coming across there, then you would have realized what I was saying by now was true, and you would now give up arguing with your pitiful grammar, go away, and of this site."

						   Mother, Dad and the oracle left in the first part of the mass family excursion to Dorset. All that will be left will be me, Big Brother, food, revision (well attempting), and Laura who I guess will be just down in dear old Brixton shagging her lover. So I'm on my own, with no Cardiff in site and just a little pub treck before even the great Ian goes on holiday also. So I really might from Monday force myself into philosophy revision. I know I've basically fucked up my other two subjects so I've really just got to just pass this subject if I have any chance of going to Uni next year *sigh* xBuBzx

						   Part 3 of the history of my favorite band - nine inch nails    Swimming in the haze: spirals, games, and soundtracks    Growth.  It is a basic principle in life.  All things grow and mature as they span their life from birth to infancy, adolescence, maturity, old age, and ultimately the final absolute in life, death.  So it is with artists, and those inclined to the musical side of the artistic element.  And so it was with Nine Inch Nails in 1994, who found themselves at the adolescent stage of their musical lifetime.  The past several years had been tumultuous for Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails, and consisted of a great deal of firsts for them.  Nine Inch Nails had signed their first record deal, released their first album, toured as a live show that turned more than a few heads, won several Grammy's, and successfully parted ways with the aforementioned label, TVT, in favour of more artistic freedom under Interscope.  Reznor had also formed his own personal label, Nothing Records, and caused yet more controversy when he purchased and moved into the infamous Tate mansion, site of the infamous Charlie Manson murders, to record Nine Inch Nails' next studio album.  By March of 1994, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails had completed work on their latest record, The Downward Spiral, and released Halo 9, "Closer".  The single and accompanying video by director Mark Romanek began to gain notoriety from an audience of fans who had been caught up in the tempestuous maelstrom that was the Grunge rock movement.  For the past several years, while Reznor remained holed up in "Pig" Studios in Beverly Hills, quite literally amidst a genuine American nightmare (or at least the site of), grunge had taken sway as the reigning King of Genres, and had eradicated virtually every hair metal band in the world.  Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and of course Nirvana held court now, and very few alternative (no pun intended) genres were holding steady against the Grunge movement.  And so, Nine Inch Nails was reborn into the media mainstream.  Three years had passed since the release of their last full album, Pretty Hate Machine, and while they had made an impression in the early stages of Grunge's uprising on tours such as Lollapalooza, most music fans' attentions were focused on the Alternative movement.  But few could easily dismiss the stark sights and sounds that were "Closer".  Pulsating beats, warbling effects and no-holds barred lyrics were justification for the great deal of attention the single garnered.  Critics began to simultaneously praise its brilliance and dismiss Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor fort 'sell-outs' the more popular the single became.  In the UK, top BBC Radio One DJ Bruno Brookes accidentally (yah, right) played the full, unedited album version of "Closer", rather than the typical, edited version distributed to radio stations free of obscenities.  Thousands of British listeners were treated to "I want to fuck you like an animal" over the airwaves, and thousands jammed the switchboards at the BBC lodging their complaints.  Reznor followed up on the success of the single with "Closer to God", an additional single that featured mixes of several other tracks including "Heresy", "March of the Pigs", and "Memorabilia", a song originally recorded by Soft Cell.  And just as quickly as Grunge fans were taking notice of Nine Inch Nails' return to rock, their limited attention spans were abruptly yanked bank to Grunge, and Trent Reznor found himself standing in the shadows yet again.  On April 8, 1994, the world was stunned to hear that Nirvana founder and frontman, the Godfather of Grunge, Kurt Cobain had taken his life the evening before with a shotgun.  Cobain had long since been painted the poster boy for the troubled, drug-addled rock star, and he had finally succumbed to the stress subjected upon him by the media, his art, drugs, and other various elements.  Trent Reznor, who had been often targeted as this same persona given his penchant for the darker side in life, did not succumb to these pressures, but rather poured them out through his art, much like Cobain had, yet had lived to tell the tale. In many ways, Cobain and Reznor were alike and several parallels can be drawn betwixt them.  Both came from broken homes.  Both had been raised in Small Town, USA.  Both had expressed obvious dissatisfaction with society.  And both felt pain and expressed it more acutely than the average bi-pedaled Homo sapiens.  Nevertheless, Reznor had survived, and with the grunge movement in an uncertain place with their leaders Nirvana dethroned, Nine Inch Nails embarked on what would be the most important tour of the band's career. From the spring through the late summer of 1994, Nine Inch Nails toured relentlessly throughout North America and Europe on their Self Destruct tour.  It would be their first major, headlining tour, and Reznor and company, now consisting of Robin Finck, Charlie Clouser, Danny Lohner, and Chris Vrenna, were making a serious impression.  The Downward Spiral was garnering critical acclaim, "Closer" had become a regular in radio and video rotation, and Nine Inch Nails were being championed as rock's future saviours as the Grunge movement did not stumble, so much as it wavered uncertainly, as if hesitant as to where to go next.  On August 13, 1994, Nine Inch Nails took the stage at Woodstock '94, alongside top acts such as Henry Rollins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash, to name but a few.  Nine Inch Nails' bombastic, frenzied, and mud-soaked performance nearly stole the show, as it were, despite the fact that there were many acts to follow.  The crowd that had assembled for Woodstock '94 were not expecting the electric hellfire that was Nine Inch Nails' live show, and the performance was heralded as nothing short of phenomenal.  Nine Inch Nails had officially arrived.  After a brief two-week break, Reznor took his Nine Inch Nails out across North America on part two of the Self Destruct tour.  Prior to setting out on tour in the spring, Trent Reznor had relatively recently discovered a band by the name of Marilyn Manson in Florida, and immediately took advantage of his newly formed Nothing label by signing them.  After producing their premier release, Portrait of an American Family, and in an ingenious move afforded him by his newfound freedom under Interscope, Reznor elected to take Marilyn Manson along as the supporting act on the Self Destruct tour, as well as a circus freak show known as The Jim Rose Circus.  Fans of Nine Inch Nails' hair-raising performances were also treated to brutal displays and horrific stunts by The Jim Rose Circus, and as well as a whole new genre of rock that they simply could not classify in Marilyn Manson.  Manson’s antics would become infamous, and the combined power of the opening acts fed the voracious craze that was rising up as more and more people were being converted into Nine Inch Nails fans.  As the year progressed and Nine Inch Nails were becoming a household rock name, Trent Reznor found himself with various opportunities that he had never been privy to before.  Tori Amos invited Reznor to sing back-up vocals on "Past the Mission" off her Under the Pink album.  He accepted and invited her to the Tate mansion for the recording process.  They quickly struck up a friendship and rumoured romance that would later mellow for widely debated reasons, though Courtney Love, widow to Kurt Cobain, has received the most popular vote as the cause of their split, and Reznor himself has indicated as such, though he has never specified.  Reznor was also invited to contribute a track to the soundtrack for the movie The Crow.  Again exercising newfound freedom muscles he didn't realize he possessed, Reznor consented and laid down another cover in the form of "Dead Souls", originally recorded by Joy Division.  Joy Division's lead singer Ian Curtis was yet another rock n' roll suicide, and the connection was downright eerie when Brandon Lee, only son to famous martial artist Bruce Lee, died making The Crow in a stunt gone horribly wrong, and on his first major motion picture, no less.  Trent Reznor was inadvertently (or ingeniously) falling under a dark and sombre umbrella that would come to envelop his career and mark his persona. Early in 1995, Nine Inch Nails would again set out in support of The Downward Spiral, joined again by The Jim Rose Circus, but this time the short leg featured another newly signed act to the Nothing label, Pop Will Eat Itself, as Marilyn Manson had embarked on smaller solo shows and set to work on future material.  Reznor was approached for another project heretofore foreign to his artistic meanderings, when Oliver Stone asked him to produce the soundtrack for the upcoming film Natural Born Killers.  Reznor took the offer as a welcome relief from touring, and he and the production crew packed up studio, flew to Europe in early 1995, and holed up to assemble the soundtrack.  The album would feature a very eclectic line-up, including the doomsday musings of Leonard Cohen, angst-heavy L7, snappy and smooth rappings of Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg, Jane's Addiction, Patti Smith, and Bob Dylan, among others, thus demonstrating Reznor's wide-ranging tastes and fearlessness when manipulating and combining various genres.  Nine Inch Nails also contributed several tracks to the effort, including a version of "Something I can Never Have" from Pretty Hate Machine, and a new song entitled "Burn", which paired with the violent, rage-infested theme of the movie perfectly.  Natural Born Killers, the film, was a smash for a number of reasons, not the least of which was director auteur Oliver Stone's name stamped on it.  In addition, the apocalyptic, serial killer ramblings had been adapted from a Quentin Tarantino screenplay, and it now had the sonic backdrop put together by the deft touch of Reznor.  After receiving critical acclaim and praise yet again, Reznor said of the experience that he would "...like to do a real soundtrack.  I'm interested in composing, whereas basically this was just editing.  I made a little souvenir of the movie but I don't really feel I've created anything.  That, I would like to do... if we ever manage to stop touring."  Nine Inch Nails would go on to Australia, where they played just a handful of festival shows, before returning to the US.  Those who would accuse Trent Reznor of resting on his laurels during that period of Nine Inch Nails' life would be horribly mistaken.  Immediately after returning from Australia, Reznor set to work producing Marilyn Manson's remix EP, Smells Like Children, which featured a cover of the Eurhythmics' "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".  The single hit the airwaves in 1995 and would arguably be Manson's biggest track both then and now, and it catapulted Marilyn Manson into the spotlight once and for all.  Reznor also set to work remixing and reworking his own material from The Downward Spiral, and these prolific remix sessions would result in Halo Ten, Further Down the Spiral, also released in 1995.  Reznor further displayed his uncanny production and mixing prowess by creating completely reinterpreted songs.  His sessions were so prolific, in fact, that Halo Ten was followed closely by Halo Ten v2, the lesser known little brother, containing a slightly different line-up than its predecessor and alternative mixes. After months occupied by these various side projects, Reznor was presented with a truly golden opportunity.  His success thus far had earned him the attention of one David Bowie, who extended an invitation to Nine Inch Nails to open during a fall tour of North America.  Needless to say, Reznor readily accepted.  So it was in the fall of 1995 that Nine Inch Nails once more struck out on tour, this time with David Bowie, giving them exposure to entirely new generations of fans that had not yet heard of them.  Nine Inch Nails' now renowned stage show, including the grand finale of "Hurt", which would occasionally feature Bowie on stage alongside Trent Reznor singing alternative choruses, garnered Nine Inch Nails respect and awe in places that Reznor had likely never dared dream of believing possible.  Nine Inch Nails would then follow this highly successful stint with yet another few months of touring North America on their own, this time opting for smaller venues and playing with Helmut.  Finally, in December of 1995, several months shy of nearly two solid years of copious touring and production, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails concluded their support of The Downward Spiral and took a break. Of course, 'taking a break' seems to be a relative expression to Trent Reznor.  Building upon the incredible momentum of Marilyn Manson's newfound success with their supporting performances of Nine Inch Nails and the "Sweet Dreams" single, Reznor and Marilyn Manson retreated to Reznor's new home at Nothing Studios, which was housed in New Orleans, Louisiana. Reznor had purchased an old mansion, located just blocks away from vampire author extraordinaire, Anne Rice, and refurbished the property to house both his own personal studio and his new residence.  His former "Pig" Studio and the Tate mansion would eventually be demolished.  Reznor retained the front door of the Tate mansion, which once bore the infamous "pig" scrawled by the real Manson cult in blood, as a souvenir.  Nearly twelve months involved Reznor and Marilyn Manson himself forging a friendship and a professional team in the production of Manson's upcoming album.  Their recording sessions are the stuff of rock and roll legend, with tales rumours of rampant drug use, excessive alcohol abuse, and other tales of debauchery.  The result, however, was nothing short of sensational.  The fall of 1996 saw the release of Marilyn Manson's sophomore studio album, Antichrist Superstar, and much like Nine Inch Nails' second album, it would mark the dawning of a new era for Marilyn Manson, both the band and the man.  Reznor's technical expertise was plainly evident on Superstar, and the singles from the album were both astounding and plentiful, including "The Beautiful People" and "Tourniquet".  Later that same year, Reznor was yet again approached by a director to work his magic on a soundtrack.  This time around it was David Lynch, who offered Reznor the production job on his upcoming film, Lost Highway.  Trent Reznor accepted, and gathered an eclectic, but viable collection of music for the piece, including newfound friend David Bowie, Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks' theme), The Smashing Pumpkins, and the German-born Rammstein.  Nine Inch Nails, of course, contributed three tracks to the album.  "The Perfect Drug" was the primary of the three, and the obligatory Halo (Eleven) was also released containing five alternate versions of the song.  Reznor would again team up with "Closer" video director Mark Romanek for a vivid and image-heavy, visceral video version of "The Perfect Drug".  Also included on Lost Highway were the tracks "Videodrones; Questions" and "Driver Down", both of which were not earmarked as Nine Inch Nails songs, but rather as "Trent Reznor", thereby marking the first time Reznor had ever 'released' a track under his personal name, as opposed to his band's name, despite the fact that most of us know that "Trent Reznor is Nine Inch Nails".  Marilyn Manson, now at the height of his fame thanks in large part to Trent Reznor, also contributed several tracks, including a bloodcurdling cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkin's "I Put a Spell On You" and an original track, "Apple of Sodom".  Marilyn Manson himself and Manson's bassist, Twiggy Ramirez, even appear in cameos in Lost Highway as porn stars.  This was also the first indication of a divide between Trent Reznor and Marilyn Manson himself and would foreshadow events yet to unfold.  Manson had allegedly wanted to produce the album, and was apparently livid that Lynch had handed the reins to Reznor.  Marilyn Manson went on to a sensational and controversy-laden world tour in support of Antichrist Superstar, and would later move on to Hollywood as the rift between Reznor and Manson grew.  Reznor continued on his workaholic regimen, and yet again got his fingers into unexplored territory when he was tapped to do the soundtrack for a video game.  Reznor would spend months in isolation writing the mood music to Quake, the sequel to the immensely popular game, Doom.  "I would do something like that mainly because it's a hobby of mine, I appreciate the technology, and it's fun to work outside Nine Inch Nails once in a while.  Quake was fun because they didn't want hard-rock goofy music going through the game," explains Reznor, "it was all about atmosphere at the time."  Quake's creator, John Carmack tipped his hat to Reznor's efforts by placing the NIN logo in the video game itself in the form of a logo imprinted on ammunition boxes.    In 1997, Trent Reznor again teamed up with David Bowie, this time to remix Bowie's single "I'm Afraid of Americans" from Bowie's album, Earthling.  Reznor, along with the now staple production crew of Charlie Clouser, Keith Hillebrandt, Dave "Rave" Ogilvie, and Danny Lohner, set to work interpreting Bowie's music.  Again thinking outside of the box that the media would love so dearly to paint for him, Reznor called upon rapper Ice Cube to lend his vocal styling to one version of the single.  Reznor would also be featured prominently as the antagonist in the video for "I'm Afraid of Americans", ostensibly appearing as said "American", replete with military style jacket and menacing glare, who stalks David Bowie through city streets throughout the video.  Thinking his production efforts for others at a halt, Reznor began the process of gathering his thoughts and artistic subconsciousness in preparation for Nine Inch Nails' third studio album.  His work had yet to get off the ground, however, for Reznor was to receive yet one more call from an infamous musician requesting his talents.  Rob Halford, former lead screamer for '80s metal giant Judas Priest and now openly gay, happened to be in New Orleans for Mardi Gras in 1997 with some friends, and when Reznor's studio was pointed out to him, he quite literally showed up knocking on Reznor's doorstep, requesting that he lend his ear to a demo Halford had.  Reznor accepted the demo, and after listening to it several months later, called Halford up and offered to produce and release the project on his Nothing label.  Reznor "told me [Halford] that he had been listening to the music and he had a vision.  He could hear them in a different way.  And could we take them and break them down and build them up again, with his interpretation?"  Halford agreed, as he "knew that this was somebody who was a visionary, an incredible talent, and he was in his own exclusive world."  The result was 1998's Voyeurs by Halford's new band, called simply Two.  While the album did not garner critical acclaim or much commercial success, many hail it as yet another production masterpiece from Trent Reznor, who once more called upon Dave "Rave" Ogilvie to aid him at the mixing desk. Reznor had had enough of production and side projects that had too long distracted him from work dedicated solely to Nine Inch Nails.  Aside from the few songs recorded for various soundtracks, Nine Inch Nails had not fashioned any new material, and it was nearly four years since the release of The Downward Spiral, more than eclipsing the typical two-year window between most musical acts' studio releases.  The time had come for Reznor to honestly buckle down and begin work on Nine Inch Nails' next record.  Having learned in several years what many artists do not in their lifetimes, Reznor began the arduous process of applying this newfound knowledge and success to the task of recording Nine Inch Nails music once again.  The progression would be long and extensive, and Nine Inch Nails fans waited impatiently for their hero to come forth with new material.  Their patience would be tested indeed, as it took Reznor nearly two more years to create his next record, a double-album opus that would attempt to sate the now ravenous appetite of his fans. xBuBzx

						   I never, EVER want to hear what my sociology exam result is, I think if I did, I'd go in to some psychotic fit. Anyway less said, soonest mended, as the dear oracle would say.  Anyway, I had a dream last night, I guess well because of what I was talking about with Justine after Troy about her life being one big mess until she found Jesus. I said fair enough and that it was good for her to vent her emotions at something if it meant that her mental well-being would remain sound, because I know If I went through what she went through, well from what I can vaguely anticipate, I doubt my brain could stomach it and just carry on as usual, and this is coming from a social fuck-up who's achieved more mistakes than is countable. I also guess that that's why I want to be part of her life, to understand these things and just to share and un-repress some things lurking around in the deepest unconscious, in both her and me. She's also really fun to be with as far, funny, un-repetitive and spontaneous (something which I adore in magnitude).  I'm still though trying to get my head around Troy. Was it good or bad I'm not sure. Usually after films I can tell straight of whether it was worth the ÃÂ£5 or not, but I'm swaying towards a thumbs up at the moment, my only concern was that Brad Pitt was cast wrong, maybe an actor with more of a prescence would have been suitable, although you can't really fault his effort in it all, he played it to his best ability and fair enough to him. Orlando Bloom was cast so so but also played it well and as for the rest of the actors/actresses (eg Helen of Troy), they all played it superbly. The only reason I'm undecided about the film is the start and the length of it all. At 2 3/4 hours, It's alot to take in at one go and a 2nd viewing wouldn't go a miss. The start seemed to have a lack of a background somewhat with the ideas of Hericles being this awesome fantastico warrior man dude, just coming straight into it like a newcome dictator without much history explained to you, and it was evident on many other features about the film. Oh well maybe I think about this stuff too much, but not really a bad effort on the part of the film-makers. Ciao for now. xBuBzx

						   Granny Smith came down to Molesey for the 1st time in 2 years yesterday and the instant she laid eyes upon me, she growled "what the fuck have you done with your hair you stupid bugger" which burst me into hysterics. What also is great about her is that she beats the living crap out of my dad (argument wise) with such truthful grace, which must be astronomically hard for a 91 year old.

So, tonight at 10, with me and my Mum minding our own business watching CSI (a rarity considering I hate CSI and "TV with Mother activities")I hear that she had collapsed from a rather sordid night of, from what I'm told "alcoholic blood transfusion" I got quite concerned for  the old lump .  Ahh well, after much transparent activity, me and Mother decided that Morden accident and emergency was far too much of a distance to reasonably give a 2nd thought about, as we had came to the conclusion that: 1. She shouldn't be drinking at that age 2. The police cell was a far more viable alternative for her.  Anyway been a boring weekend so far, apart from I met someone new who I like sort of, and I might ask her out sometime soon I guess. Well I hope I get the courage anyway. Ciao. xBuBzx

						   I must be going through a backward 1 step then forward 2 steps kind of day or week, or if you want to be mischievous, life.  No; life would be something only depressed 14 year olds do (i.e. me a couple of years ago).  I really can't be bothered to clean out the flea ridden litter until the motivation returns - which suffice to say shouldn't be too quick in its glorious return.  Weekend is shaping up to be funky - I'm meeting this ultra-cool girl and we're going to SEGAWORLD woo!!!!! I always remember that place from when I was little and it was so awesome that I thought it due time for a revisit, and if all doesn't go to plan, then we'll be of to the pub. I really like this one, she's so unlike her age lol - if that makes any sense. On Saturday I'm going for a 8-3 shift at work and then traxlover has a big super-extreme happy/hippy party planned which she's asked me to grace with a tenner for the lovely drug bloke. He seems so sweet with the guns and death threats and all I bet he dishes out with regular consistency to all his "chums". Aha me and my warped soap box of complex opinionated bullshit. xBuBzx

						   If you know me fantastically well or not, the fact whether you know or judge me is really quite irrelevant, I've decided from this weekend that I'm going to sort out the whole sexuality issue once and for all. It's been manifesting itself (for want of a better term) for near on 6 years with boyfriends and girlfriends, flings and other stuff. I know I won't truly know what I am until I'm say 20, but I can't stand the constant change of opinion, so I have to deal with this whole thing once and for all. Think of it as a never ending isle of sweets with unsupervised children, and waiting for them to hence reach a conclusion of true nirvana, and you understand my longitudinal dilema.  I don't think I love a girl I thought I did once. I guess if the weekend had a moral - that would be it. Well really it's been a 3 day weekend with the bank holiday and all, saw Anna and others, went to green fair and saw loads of folk I haven't seen in ages like Nikki and Tom and Bronwen. Was fun. Today however I've done a 7-4 shift and tomorrow I have a 9-6 shit planned YAY.  Well I guess I'll just have to trust a lot more people with the whole sexuality stuff. Well the one poor sole who from what I gather regularly visits this blog is in for a strange literary sensation tonight when finishing this sentence which I'm going to make you suffer by not stopping haha askdfjaskfafshaf *hides in embarrassment* xBuBzx

						   Not even properly Saturday yet and this 7 day weekend marathon preview to the 6 week/3 months/42 day weekend - is well under swing.  Thursday saw me try to get a grip on my deepest and darkest fear at the Greyhorse, and upon my immediate arrival, hearing the initial "QUEER" chant, brought me back to what I know and love - ignoring Ewan. If there is such a staunch ravage fucker as him, I have, and probably will never find one. This all bought me into deep, inhumanely pleasurable fantasies of a cigarette facial dis-figuation of the young chap, and his petite manhood. Alas I managed to control my urges enough to amuse myself on the image of the refusal of entry of over half of the parasites, and to enjoy an old acquaintance - Rowan's extremely funky quartet of funk and rock to its maximum. I also have to say that if Law ever decides to return for good, then this would be a greatly appreciated thing - good luck with Rachael and life down under in Fiery Dorset, and I can only hope you appreciate this overly korny paraphrase. Jen was also good for being there, I had to close the whole book on that school, and well The book was well and truly singed as far as I'm concerned, and her being there helped no end, whether the whole ting was done indirectly or not, I've never before managed to make friends with these kind of non-gothic wonders, before, and actually realizing how funky they all are, since joining Esher. Hell I even managed a half decent conversation with Chris Hodgson for crying out loud.  Anyway, tonight I went to another rock show with Jen, Law and Dan this time, in Richmond to see a band with such an exceptionally gorgeous lead singer, one who even Jens eyes were firmly planted upon. She can really sing, and after seeing her and the band, If only in a few gigs of late, they will definitely go somewhere if they keep working hard and go the way they are at the moment.  Tomorrow I'm of to Camden to meet with Anna, and more importantly Jo, of which I'm spine razor tingling nervous over. I guess if I just keep it cool and not drink or take too much and just do what I also am extremely good at, which is keeping quiet around large crowds, and so therefore lowering the scientific chance that I will make a twat out of myself, all should be dandy. Ah well, It's quarter to 3 now so I have by all accounts been speaking to you at this time for far a far too considerable time compared to a normal person, So I bid you - adjeu. xBuBzx

						   Work was for once, of a bearable standard, with Becky not being that sadistic (although her traits will not die!). Hell even Katherine seemed quite funky for the most part, which I can't say is the norm for her from what I've known, and I'd love to get to know both of the better, but its just the way, that not only them, but myself come across towards each other which is the possible reason for the feeling of nausea we all experience when we encounter the joint presence of each other. I'm sure they're lovely and all, but anyway . . .  God how I was scared at 2 am this morning when I thought it was the philosophy exam at 9, and to my utter relief, and utter adoration of Emaan from here on in - it was only the 3rd attempt to get a GCSE in mathematics and nothing of a more sinister persuasion.  I'm getting quite girlishly excited about seeing Jo on Saturday now, (with mentions from my friends of bout's of giggling and skipping amongst other things lol) and I am NOT going to ruing the 1st opportunity with a girl in 2 years out of esteem naivete. I like her. She's so funky, and anyone who talks to her would utter the same warm friendly gestures as I would about her. Anyway - I'm fairly tired now, so I must be of. Ciao. xBuBzx

						   I feel quite the fool at the moment, and in some sense utterly betrayed by myself and Jo about how the last few days have turned out.   Myself because well, I put all my eggs in her basket so to speak. I know I shouldn't have done, but it's been so long, I guess anyone would have done the same wouldn't they?   Why though would she have done certain things after the things and excuses she's used? What exactly is it about me that has suddenly make her act like this all of a sudden. I'm beginning to understand why some men can never understand women. Us men do indeed have our flaws, but women are hardly innocent parties in it all.  Well, I guess there's a lot more time and people out there who are more suitable.   One thing that bothers me deeply is not to do with Jo, but I gave up men for quite a while because I lost faith in them, and now after the events of the last few days, I seem to have lost faith in women as well.   So who am I supposed to trust?   My friends have had a sordid history of letting me down so to speak, and I could tell by Frances' actions that she was hardly going to see that Argentinean film out of the pleasure of my company, merely as pay back for me doing a few of those shifts. I happened to have figured that out just before I turned into central avenue bus stop to see her waiting there, "tired". She's is sweet, my gosh yes, but I couldn't bare to look at her because I knew that the whole evening was just fake. Anna for instance, called me from Spain of all places, not to ask how I was, but to pathetically beg for me to add to her phone credit, because she couldn't get of her backside to find a job of her own. I mean I love Frances and Anna to pieces, but they are not my true friends.  I even called up the one person today who I really (like Jen) thought that about a year ago I would never befriend his kind of people, Ian, to see if I could drown my pitiful sorrows with him. Alas even he couldn't show me how much of a "best friend" he claimed to be but a fortnight ago. No, I can't take things out on old E, the thought of him just makes me giggle, and I know he's just about the most genuine person I know anyway.  No one ever seems to make a great effort to see more of me because they enjoy my presence, they never have, and they never will; I accept this yes, but what other contenders are there?  I still don't trust either of my parents after the coming-outgate, where once upon a time, my Dad was my hero, and I don't see or care enough of my siblings to even try with them. Harry is too young, and making new friends at college wouldn't be worth it as I figure they'll all just be replicas of the one's I have at the moment.  Bah, maybe I'm just too cynical, and my trust issues after Halliford were damaged irreversibly I guess, but I hate this waiting for a mutual loving companion, even at 17. My wish for a while now has been to settle down permanently, to properly help me recover from school. The parasites still haunt my dreams, which goes to show that they'll never leave me properly, so I put 2 + 2 together and a companion made 4. When will the confidence gamble ever pay of? xBuBzx

						   I post to you at this most vivid and peaceful time, to show you to the extent to which insomnia has griped my epicenter over the past year.  I haven't slept properly from earlier than 11 at night until past half 8 in the morning for longer than I can remember, and things gradually seem to be taking me down with it. Bad news, motivation and concentration all seem to have suffered somewhat, to which I am seriously considering going to the doctor about. I doubt it is total insomnia, just maybe a partial nocturnal situation, a fear of the night per say.  So I won't drag this out upon you poor souls any longer, I just thought I might address this situation to what I feel is the truest thing in my life at the moment - this blog. I don't think it's all that sad to be honest, my ego needs a good kick up the posterior to get it going. xBuBzx

						   If there were no blond teenage girls in the world - would there be half as much stereotypical comments made about women in 20th century as there has been?  Just a thought . . .  Anyway, It's Friday night and I have absolutely nothing planned except writing offensive comments in an e-forum and maybe contributing to one if I feel especially productive. Gives me a good chance to get a bath and get the driver on my ignamous parasite of a home PC sorted. Well not  me  technically but John from work. However I figure that the ÃÂ£10 payment should buy the claiming rights to that one and make me look and feel just grand.  College feels particularly strange at the moment - especially now I'm a 6.2 whereas last week I was just a mere tiny 6.1 midget. The place too seems petite in comparison, and I guess that could be to do with the fact that, half the people aren't here; possibly because they've realised they're too blond et al for college, or, in my opinion, they have been abducted or eaten by some mass government conspiracy. Well this is how much time I have on my hands these days that I actually formulate these premises/ denoumons .  Thankfully England, or Rooney beat Switzerland last night and so we're still in the competition thus far. Next up if the green room with Ian on Monday for the Croatia game (wherever the "green room" is I have no Idea, It's Ian's fault like most things in life). I guess we'll win narrowly and France will beat the Switz by even less and be given far more credit than us for there "champion spirit". Wasn't the world cup 2 years ago, and the limited victories over minnow nations in the Euro qualifiers enough indication, that this team, despite its great individual talent, has:  1. Got and over-rated manager, who will do worse than Pleat did at Spurs next season. 2. Become two years past its sell-by date?  Oh well, what do I know, I'm only 17 and small and my opinions are worthless compared to people who are so unbelievably over-paid to play, manage, and analyze this game. I guess so. Has anyone noticed however, how absolutely vile the ITV football commentators were last night, messers Tlysdley and Robson? One, Robson (as my Dad would say) is the most boring man on Earth at the best of times when in the 50's; and Tylsdley . . . *huffs and scowls vigorously* Tylsdley just one doesn't shut up, and his over-emphasised cliche's and the mention of Manchester United on over 25 occasions in every match (including the Botswana v Zimbabwe womens friendly reserve match more recently) is just placing in some mental trauma for the 120 minutes I am forced to sit through his "commentary".  Anyway, enough of my ranting, I can see (yes through my wonderful internet remote viewing) that you are asleep by now, so I hope you, all have a funky weekend, and I most certainly will on Saturday with Jo Jo hehe. Ciao mon ami. xBuBzx

						   Here's the final part of the history of my favorite band Nine Inch Nails:    Swimming In The Haze: Evolution and the consummate perfectionist    Evolution, a fundamental tenet of the world as we know it, affects but is not necessarily grasped by everyone and everything.  Plants and animals continually adapt and evolve to meet the changing environment and all of the chemicals and pollution we pump into it daily, or they perish.  Popular media and art must evolve to mirror, embrace, or comment on our current state of social relevance is vital to art's very survival, or a disdainful audience will surely banish the unwanted art to velvet canvas and garage sale grab bags.  Darwin would have us believe even we as human beings have evolved from the most basic of life forms initially springing up from nothing at some point in the very distant past, or else our simian cousins might be surfing the Internet in our place, happily munching on a banana.  And as you no doubt have witnessed, dear reader, Nine Inch Nails, thankfully, has grasped the concept of evolution, though not so easily.  While many artists evolve as easily as one changes their clothing and thus remain in the public eye (see: David Bowie), and still others refuse to evolve and thus perish (see: hair metal), some artists struggle with altering their mindset in an effort to continue down the path of making genuinely meaningful and relevant music.  Following the enormous success of The Downward Spiral, its several singles and shocking videos that catapulted Nine Inch Nails into the mainstream (if their touring on Lollapallooza hadn't already), all of the live shows, soundtrack production, and umpteen interviews later, Trent Reznor found himself at a curious place.  Reznor does not pull punches when he describes Nine Inch Nails and himself following their last round of touring in support of The Downward Spiral, as a "bloated, stupid thing that had become a parody of itself."  Reznor was becoming the very thing he had so long rallied against...just "another retarded rock guy."  After viewing videotapes of himself and his band, and taking a personal inventory as a person, Reznor realized he "was shitty to people, shitty to old friends and new people [he] met."  He had become what he had never wanted to be when he set out to be successful musician.  "It didn't work," Reznor says of his state at the time.  "I could pretend I fit into that role onstage every night Â the antics and nonsense.  But alone I had a kind of bottoming out.  I was losing friends; I had the woman who raised me die.  Nothing seemed to matter.  The last thing I wanted to do was write an album."  And so Reznor was forced to take stock of his values, self, and the project called Nine Inch Nails, in an attempt to evolve and move forward.  In 1997, when Trent Reznor began working on Nine Inch Nails' third studio album The Fragile, he lost the grandmother who had raised him.  He had recently produced three Marilyn Manson albums, personally guiding the shock rocker to stardom and the top of the charts, only to then be snubbed by the jealousy of the Reverend Manson not long after.  Reznor found himself alone, without close family and friends, and ashamed of what he had become.  So the early stages of The Fragile and the writing involved did not come easily.  "I just didn't want to sit down with a notebook and see what was in there," Reznor says.  "I didn't want to uncap the fuckin' cauldron and see what came out."  After speaking with several friends, including producer Rick Rubin, Reznor temporarily left New Orleans in favour of a cozy house at one of America's most visually stunning locations Â Big Sur, California.  With its majestic cliffs and awe-inspiring views, advisors touted the magical quality of the scenery, which might help lift Reznor from the depths of his depression and break his self-imposed writer's block.  "That was terrifying," Reznor says of his time there.  "I went insane and almost killed myself sitting at a piano trying to write like Tom Petty does.  I think Petty's great.  I also realize that when I sit down and do that it starts to sound like Billy Joel's The Stranger."  The several months spent there alone with a piano proved largely unfruitful for the troubled musician, but the venture was not a total write-off.  Of the one solitary track that Big Sur yielded and would eventually find itself onto The Fragile, Left's "La Mer", Reznor remembers "sitting down and playing the piano and thinking 'How did I ever forget that this is what brought me joy?'  How the fuck did that get lost in the mess?  How did I let that happen?'  It's not doing interviews, it's not fucking live shows, not backstage passes and bank accounts of all that shit doesn't matter.  I did this because I love music."  Which is precisely the type of musician Reznor is Â a true composer.  While many artists, be they musically inclined or in favour of other artistic mediums, fail to cope and wrestle with their inner demons, Reznor would overcome his by simply making music. Several storied musicians helped Reznor with his writer's block, and coached him on how to battle the funk he was in.  David Bowie offered his advice even before Reznor fell into his dark slump, while Nine Inch Nails was still opening for Bowie in the late nineties.  "We had long talks when we were on tour together.  He said to me at one point...'try writing in the third person, because you'll find that you'll get yourself out of a hole that I was once in.'"  While Reznor wrestled with this suggestion, finding it difficult to do, he also considered the relevancy of how big Nine Inch Nails had become, and dealt with the personal demons that came with going from a cool, underground band to being well-known and successful, which possibly alienated many fans who didn't think such a band would be cool anymore.  "I could relate to that," Reznor comments.  "I didn't go to see the Jesus and Mary Chain after they got big.  So, I had to ask myself whether I should be trying to make my music more inaccessible, or should I just do what I think is true to myself."  It was actually Bono of U2 who offered the sage advice "fuck those people.  Don't ever think that what you do is so elite that it's only for certain people."  And so Reznor soldiered on, the core of his very self slowly evolving. Reznor accepted the fact he had become emotionally compromised, and set out to do something about it.  He flirted with psychiatry (now that would make for an interesting file to read), but quickly found it unsuccessful.  Reznor also flirted with medication, sampling Effexor and Paxil, but discovered antidepressants and Nine Inch Nails did not exactly go hand in hand. "I was in an abnormally positive mood all the time," Reznor states.  "Everything was like, 'It's okay.  We'll get to that.  Whatever.'  Part of what drives my personality got removed."   In the fall of 1997, Reznor decided the best course of action for battling his depression was to throw himself wholeheartedly into writing and recording The Fragile.  Returning to New Orleans and Nothing Studios, Reznor and producer Alan Moulder retreated to the confines of the Nothing compound for nearly two years.  Remaining almost totally aloof from the outside world, stepping out of the shelter of Nothing Studios only occasionally for the odd CD or to acquire an instrument, Reznor remained happily removed and ambivalent to the goings-on of the everyday world.  Instead, he turned his energies inward and simply tried to put all of the "mouldy, decaying" sounds in his head on tape.  Reznor poured himself into his music.  While many artists watch the clock, keeping tally of the costly hours involved studio time; Reznor knew no such troubles, situated as he was in his very own studio.  So he could focus on the music, without the typical distractions that might hinder the creative process.  And Reznor wasn't quick to dismiss the opportunity.  "...We would try things that I would've taken short cuts to arrive at in the past," Reznor says of the long hours spent in the studio.  "Like, instead of a background noise off a movie which was what Downward Spiral was all about we'd go find the original place and mic it.  Instead of a sample of a cello, it was like, 'Let's borrow one from down the street and see what happens if you put the wrong strings on it.  Whoa!  Check this sound out!'  We had space and time to try that kinda stuff." As Reznor and Moulder neared completion of the album, they found themselves with over forty tracks, and the revelation the music they had made in their self-imposed exile from the outside world might not be at all like anything the public currently considered palatable.  In an industry churning out bubblegum, midriff-baring pop music, The Fragile, Reznor realised, did not resemble anything being produced at the time.  Further, Reznor and Moulder both believed that after being holed up with the same music for such an excruciatingly long recording process, objectivity had been compromised.  "...'La Mer' was one of our favourites, and it was gonna be the first song on disc one.  Then it was 'Nah, let's make it the first song on disc two.'  Then 'Nah, let's make it the first single!'  'No, wait!  Let's call the album La Mer!'  And you approach a song like that with reverence you cherish it so much, you're not being objective about where it should go," Reznor stated as they came to the end of The Fragile's sessions.  Sensing yet another tailspin into countless obsessive-compulsive tangents, the duo put in a call to producer Bob Ezrin, mastermind behind one of Reznor's long-time favourites, Pink Floyd's The Wall.  After convincing the legendary producer to come and spend a week in New Orleans, Ezrin disappeared into the depths of Nothing Studios and three days later, he emerged with reams of notes.  In a very businesslike manner, he proceeded to tell Reznor what the weak spots on the album were, the highlights, and basically, the type of record Reznor had just made.  Excitedly, Reznor put on the compilation made by Ezrin, and found it to be..."terrible!  Halfway through the first side I was daydreaming, I was looking out the window," as he says of the first attempt at finalizing The Fragile.  Needless to say, it wasn't easy for Reznor to tell someone like Bob Ezrin that he had failed and his track order just did not suffice.  Further, Reznor began to doubt himself, wondering if the past two years spent in isolation had all been for naught.  Ezrin took the feedback in stride, however, and returned to the drawing board.  On the final day of Ezrin's visit, Reznor came into the studio in the morning to find some new discs sitting on his desk.  Of the morning, Reznor says "I wasn't particularly in a bad mood, but I sure wasn't in a good mood.  And I wasn't very optimistic about what I was gonna hear.  So I sat down right here and I put it on.  I didn't have a list of songs, so I didn't know what was coming.  And halfway through the first CD was when it hit me, when I started crying.  And I was thinking, 'if it ends now, it'd be perfect.'  Then I immediately put the second CD on thinking, 'Well, this can't be good because all of my favourite songs are on the first CD.  I uhhhh, think what else could be left?'  But it finished and I was stunned like, 'Fuckin-A!  Alright!' I couldnt believe it!  I had goosebumps!"  Poker-faced, Reznor called his last minute hope into his office, and had Ezrin sit down on his huge leather couch.  With a straight face, Reznor told him that he had done it, and Ezrin replied simply, "I know."  Reznor responded: "Well, why did you fucking well wait 'til the last day then, smartass?"  And they quickly embraced, for it was good.  It was very good, indeed.  In the fall of 1999, Nine Inch Nails and their new album, The Fragile, were quickly back in the limelight.  Debuting at Number One on the Billboard charts, Halo Fourteen moved 250,000 units in its debut week, before beginning to slip back down the charts.  Accompanied by the first single, "We're In This Together", The Fragile was a huge success with fans of all respects, but the album never quite achieved the success that its predecessor, 1994's The Downward Spiral did.  Speculation looked to several reasons, including The Fragile's length, or its not-so-radio friendly singles such as "Into the Void", and "Starfuckers, Inc."  Still, The Fragile was heralded as sonic mastery, and everyone clamoured to lift its mastermind, Trent Reznor, to their shoulders as the saviour of music.  Numerous publications put Reznor's scowling visage back on their covers, including Rolling Stone and Raygun, and Spin magazine went so far as to rank The Fragile as "Album of the Year".  While The Fragile did not enjoy the commercial success of the typical pop thoroughfare, the musical community happily embraced it, injected as they were with the newfound sense of hope and vitality that came with Reznor's double-album opus. The next step was a logical one.  Tour.  And so, slightly evolved and still inwardly smarting from his behaviour during The Downward Spiral touring years, Trent Reznor gathered together his long-time band mates, plus or minus a few members.  Keyboardist Charlie Clouser and bassist Danny Lohner returned to the NIN camp, and Robin Finck was re-called from his brief stint with Axl Rose and Guns N' Roses' long-awaited Chinese Democracy.  Former drummer Chris Vrenna had parted ways with Nine Inch Nails in favour of his new personal project, Tweaker, so in his stead Reznor recruited the relatively unknown Jerome Dillon.  After four years away from the stage, Reznor wisely planned several warm-up gigs in and around the world, including locations such as New Orleans, New York City, the Bahamas, as well as a memorable Grammy performance.  After a few private and small-audience sessions, Nine Inch Nails were back in shape, practiced on the new material, and they set out to assault the world with their unique slice of sonic boom.  Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails would go on to tour the world once over, including an Eastern global tour dubbed Fragility v1.0 and a Western hemisphere stint entitled, logically, Fragility v2.0.  As per usual, the visual act that was Nine Inch Nails was almost ridiculously impressive, and the tour was consistently ranked as one of the best live shows of the year, and even received said nod from Rolling Stone.  Reznor had taken the angst, intensity, and spectacle of Nine Inch Nails' live trademark, and further morphed it into a more eye-enticing display.  Fragility became the live manifestation of the Nine Inch Nails experience, and where the music had evolved and taken on a more mature and sombre attitude, so too, did the live concert.  Three large LCD displays majestically dropped from above the band early on in the show, and distorted, beautifully simple images flashed across the screen behind a slightly more subdued band.  While hardcore favourites such as "Head Like A Hole" and "Wish", as well as newcomers like "Starfuckers, Inc.", continued to whip the crowd and band into a frenzy, more restrained pieces such as "La Mer" and "The Great Below" were thrown into the mix to provide a more all-encompassing musical experience that truly ran the gamut of emotion.  The Fragile would see several singles and videos released, though only two would actually become official Halos.  Halo Thirteen, the single for "The Day the World Went Away", predecessor to the actual release of The Fragile, saw the ravenous appetite of Nine Inch Nails fans whetted by just three tracks.  Two tracks were actually pulled directly from the upcoming record, including the title track and "Starfuckers, Inc.".  Unusually, the release carried only one "Quiet" mix of "The Day the World Went Away".  Halo Fifteen, released after The Fragile, was the single for "We're In This Together", and numerous versions of the Halo were released internationally.  Some contained further remixes of "The Day the World Went Away", while still others carried two bonus tracks previously available only on the vinyl release of The Fragile, "10 Miles High" and "The New Flesh".  After the Fragility tour, as is tradition, Reznor returned to the studio and revisited his masterpiece, and emerged with Halo Sixteen, Things Falling Apart.  The obligatory Nine Inch Nails remix album saw Reznor hand over the reins primarily to those close to him, rather than complete all the reworking himself.  Old collaborators such as Keith Hillebrandt and Dave Ogilvie were recruited yet again, and band mates Charlie Clouser and Danny Lohner also contributed, among others.  A remix of Gary Numan's "Metal" was also thrown in as a tidbit of new material.  This hugely successful period of Nine Inch Nails life also brought with it Trent Reznor's official foray into the Internet.  Both nin.com and nothingrecords.com were launched, not to mention various other sites, such as objectmerch.com, carrying Nothing's official merchandise, and sub-sites for NIN releases, including andallthatcouldhavebeen.com.  Always the consummate perfectionist, Reznor's web sites were visually stunning and completely engrossing, and many hidden links and gems were cleverly disguised therein.  Always committed to the fans, Reznor also allowed the download of exclusive, Internet-only available material, including remixed tracks, live sequences from the Fragility tours, and pics.  In short, the Internet versions of Nine Inch Nails and Nothing Records were just what you expected from Trent Reznor. Following on the success of the Fragility tours, Reznor readied for the release of the first live material available from Nine Inch Nails.  Whilst touring, Reznor had had the foresight to plan the release of the material, and Reznor and crew routinely handed out camcorders to crew and fans in an effort to obtain more raw and true to life live experiences that aren't typically captured by the highly-polished, sweeping cameras of big budget live music.  Upon returning to New Orleans, Reznor and team set to work at their trusty Macs to put together and attempt to capture the live Nine Inch Nails experience on both CD and DVD.  To be the first DVD released by Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor wanted to ensure that if it was going to be done, it would be done right.  Halo Seventeen, And All That Could Have  Been, was just that.  After various delays, it was released in early 2002 to much fanfare.  Both the CD and DVD release truly captured the essence of Nine Inch Nails live, and further reinforced their reputation as possibly one of the world's greatest live bands.  Chock full of hidden 'Easter eggs', including unreleased videos and the live segment showing Trent Reznor and estranged friend Marilyn Manson reuniting on stage in triumphant renditions of "The Beautiful People" and "Starfuckers, Inc.", And All The Could Have Been truly showcased the magnificence of the live performances given by Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor.  As is typical with Nine Inch Nails, several different versions of Halo Seventeen were released, including a deluxe CD package containing a bonus disc entitled Still.  Also previously available individually via nin.com, Still featured a very stripped-down, raw musical version of the Nine Inch Nails product.  Months earlier, whilst on the North American tour of Fragility, Reznor and Nails stopped into a Chicago radio station and played an unplugged set to a very small and no doubt dumbfounded audience.  While the CRC Sessions, as they have so been dubbed, were never officially released, Reznor did revisit the concept following the tour, and Still is the result.  Free of the countless samples and harsh electronica that defines Nine Inch Nails' sound, Still featured just Reznor with a piano and guitar, along with several band mates equally as unplugged.  Haunting, raw, and viscerally beautiful, Still took many fans by surprise, showcasing the musical talent of a man often hidden behind a wall of cacophonous sound.  And now, years later, Reznor has retreated yet again into oblivion.  Since the release of And All That Could Have Been in 2002, Nine Inch Nails has not released anything, nor has much been seen or heard from the NIN camp.  Rampant speculation and the always churning rumour mill that is the NINternet have led to suppositions as to possibilities for the future of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.  For years, the Tapeworm project, involving any number of musicians including Maynard James Keenan of Tool and A Perfect Circle fame, Atticus Ross of 12 Rounds, Zach de la Rocha formerly of Rage Against the Machine, and Trent Reznor himself, continues to remain mired in obscurity and legal battles between the various artists' record companies.  While band mates of Reznor have moved on to side projects, such as Danny Lohner's recent production of the soundtrack to the film Underworld, nothing seems to be stemming from Trent Reznor's corner.  Nin.com has remained virtually unchanged for several years now, with the exception of very muddled, mysterious images and quotes loosely centered primarily on Ursula K. Le Guin's novel The Lathe of Heaven, that slowly appeared (and subsequently disappeared) over the course of several weeks in the fall of 2003, until nin.com finally closed its 'doors' several months ago in favour of a single graphic that prevents entry to the site.  Nothing Records has been equally unproductive, with little to no releases from long overdue artists like 12 Rounds, and the website, previously interactive and relatively interesting, has advertised the same upcoming releases for, quite literally, years.  What will the future of Nine Inch Nails hold?  With Reznor fast approaching his forties, he is not the young man full of piss and vinegar, unbridled hatred and animosity, and confusion and self-loathing that he was nearly two decades ago when he threw his hat into the musical ring.  Reznor will soon be negotiating middle-age, and with that comes a whole new host of inner speculation and soul searching.  The typical collection of thoughts on society, religion, life and death,  blah, blah, blah, undoubtedly still exist in Reznor's innermost being, but a new faction of concerns have no doubt surfaced, including love, family, and the possibility of children.  How will this new, older and wiser Trent Reznor interpret the world?  And more importantly, how will he choose to comment on it via the medium of music?  While unfounded rumours continue to spread, magazine articles become fewer and far between, and all but the most dedicated fan sites dwindle into obscurity, NIN fans now in the know as to typical periods of downtime between releases yet again patiently await the next album to, ahem, bleed through. xBuBzx

						   Things with Jo are going pretty swell and slowish which are really good. I'm glad I've got something stable finally - and we're of to the Imax cinema near Waterloo this weekend for some grade A geek eye wear movie viewing and Grade A* company with each other I guess if that makes any sense.  Anyway, It's England v Switzerland tonight, and I'm of to Wimbledon probably with Kate for and hour and a half of getting to know her/whilst drinking/innocent flirting with her I guess before some very graphic and audible swearing at the plasma screen - oh YAY. IF we lose this game, anything at all like the last game then I may go into some psychotic manic depression and alloy a knife to my wrist. Surprisingly, I haven't got bored of any of the football games yet - must be an indication as to what the state of my social life these day . . .  Well I'm back at college at the moment, and It's a "back to work" day, just some PC nonsense. Been ok I guess and It's no work and no pressure of exams on my mind (all be it apart from the last maths one). This week should be ok, nothing major is planned too much apart from seeing Jo which is more major I guess apart from an average movie trip. Speaking of movie trips - I went to see a film called imagining Argentina with the amazingly sweet Frances from work. It was so much better that I thought it would be, and Antonio Banderas played it really well. Anyway must be of. xBuBzx

						   Well any need for MAJOR revision is not thankfully at an end. Well It's not like it I did much anyway. Philosophy was three hours of laughing at amazing suspense at how little I actually know about philosophy. Half of the time I was staring at Ed beside me -happily completing the 6 pages for each paper - and I was happy too, staring at him was lovely considering just how awesomely cute he is (-:  Anyway, Saturday went well. Well I say well but this poor guy I know got stabbed in the back literally by Somalians - and he looked like the guy you can see if you go to the link in my name. I felt really sorry. Mind you if you throw huge black townies into Camden Lock - it is highly unlikely that you would come out in the long run un-scaved. Anyway the guy is now in hospital as far as I know and won't die at least . . .  Jo seemed funky, quite lively; but funky . . . . . . . . . . . erm oooh weathers nice hehe. Well if exurberance is your forte, then she's your type of lady. Ahh what am I saying, she's lovely really, and I can't wait to come see her again. I'm back into my favorite blogging place at the moment with the nicest keyboard your ever going to meet, and so I'm not making half as many errors whilst typing to you here. Hmmmmm maybe I could thieve it perhaps. It's just so soft and cleansing on my fingers, which could I guess be used for a nasty analogy if you have my two track mind - taboo's and sexual orientation (more than just one track eh Tammy).  Oh my as well, that football match almost destroyed my mental wellbeing yesterday. God how can anyone (never mind England) lose it after 92 minutes I'll never know. Well it's Switzerland on Thursday which we basically have to win to stay in it. Hopefully it will be a walk in the park but you never know with these things.  Not much really to do for the rest of the week except do some overtime if any were available to me, so I guess I'll just have to attempt a diet or something to keep my mind in full lubrication as it were. Well that or write. Or figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life once I discover the trio of E's in August. Well my dream career would being well paid to do this blog everyday. If only blogger cared enough to give me the chance - God knows how I'd love to entertain/piss of the masses. As my good friend Ian would say, it would be pretty "cool" - with an uninterested Daria type facial expression.  Currently the LRC is bare empty (for the love of good I couldn't think of a non-townieish term other than bare - I do apologize sincerely) with most people just on here to stare at the porn because they can't afford a home PC i.e pikeys  Anyway, unless something comes up in the next 10 seconds remotely meaningful to write, I'll have to say ciao. Oh darn it I can't think of diddle squat *sigh* xBuBzx

						   She really should have just held on to the cap in that mank chamber of a vagina in 1986, and not have let go so easily to the ogre's advances. Well my justified view anyway.  I try my hardest to give that child some discipline, anyone in there right mind would see he gets his posterior kissed on a regular, guilty conscience's basis. Also that he, even for a 5 year old, is one of the most cocky, self righteous, obnoxious, temperamental drama queens walking around.   So the argument started with me doing what regular people do and show Harry up and tell him of in the  proper  way, and I get "disciplined" for it. They then come steaming up when I was first attempting to manuscript this blog, and of we went. Ones really brought from deep inside the closet were thrown in all directions, me with my mind games, them with there pitiful double act of "official ownership regulations Ltd" and it boiled down to both parties telling each other where the other could stick it, if they didn't like the opposing proposition. All got rather tense, violence planned, but, fortunately for my mental well being and my psychotic nature with that cliche hypocrite, it failed to materialize.  Anyway, I need some rest-bite from that tomfoolery, so I'll probably be of to see Shrek earlier than planned at Wimbledon with Ian. He really makes me put things into prospectus, well them anyway, and I need a good rat about things and he is the ultimate agony aunt. God bless his soul. xBuBzx

						   England blew out on the important occasion yet again last night, 6-5 on penalties to the hosts Portugal. I dare not go into too much detail, I'll just ruin that new pacemaker of mine into extreme anguish, as well as my syntax. Just, well, I don't think the goal shouldn't have been allowed, and I can't wait for Shaun Wright-Phillips to take over the reigns at right midfield when David Beckham retires, he was abysmal, and his 2 penalty misses in the competition would, if have been taken properly, have seen us through.  Anyway, quite a few people are out of the local area at the moment, including Thomas and Jen and Frances and Anna to name a few. So tonight I guess I'll just be at home watching the start of Glastonbury on TV (whilst trying to spot gorgeous Thomas hehe) and mulling over who Chelsea should buy in the remaining close season now that the players are available to talk transfers, as the come hither in drips and drabs. My bet is Rooney and Joaquin, and if not Joaquin like expected, then Shaun Wright-Phillips.  Apart from those couple of things or so, there hasn't really been much going on at my life at the moment, well for this week anyway; I had enough time last to make the blog even more professional with even more links (well this happening after I destroyed the HTML language yet again trying to add extortionist links in my crazy way). Now my plan is just to pester Blogger until they allow free funky "splash introductions" like the one's you get for accomplished rock bands or the Chelsea FC web page (click link in my name). Ooooh I guess I do have another plan to do this weekend, to go and see Ian and get pissed, and think long and hard about coursework for all three subjects (bar philosophy who can't get the finger out and just  GIVE  it to us) and finally to see whether I can broaden the style/vocabulary and general literary verity in the blog writing, and so I envisage quite a few more literature issues coming, one's which will be a just and deserved carry on from the  Swimming In The Haze  series. Well this and in addition too - official Chelsea management game 2003/2004, and convincing the football faithful that (yes this guy's name being mentioned again) Shaun Wright-Phillips is worth buying as a right-midfielder. Sure to be a roller-coaster ride *sobs* . . . xBuBzx

						   With my hand nerves ever deteriorating, I came to contemplate some rather twisted demeaning denoumons on the till last evening. The majority included how to destroy Katherine and Becky in one swift execution, the other, which was the far more horrific of the two, involved me extensively analyzing what I would do If the shingles in my wrist got worse and I developed a motor neuroneish disorder, or worse, a limb castration. You can see how my life's priorities are just  swell  at the present time.  Anyway on a lighter note, I've changed the format in the blog in the past week, with the help of Jen, to, in my opinion, give it a touch more professional appeal. It's more defined, colorful, with more links than before. Well it is my eyes only, even if they are more corrupted than patients on prosaic . . .  Finally got round to purchasing a new £30 (ooh BuBz really splashed out there hasn't he) "JanSport" hiker/skater bag. It's something I always quite craved when I was around the age of 14, and, I just decided to see whether those dreams of a "funkier look" would be more justified even at a later age ofadolescencee.  The new NIN album "bleedthrough" has been playing on my mind somewhat. It came upon me during an Eminem sing-along near the couches (a.k.a the sofa crew), and I'm really desperate for Trent to show pop music for what it really is - meh I can't be bothered to go into it now; only 3 years until I die slowly from terminal illness, and not nearly enough time to divulge into great detail. Well, must be of now for Psychology so . . . xBuBzx

						   Something came up to me today, of I felt it more like, which has been manifesting itself over the past week; and it's rather worrying to be honest.  When I clench my fist or strecth my fingers to a certain parabola, the seem to lose all feeling literally. I mean it's scary. It's been getting progressively more apparent and hence far more noticeable and of a far greater degree of concern has succumb due to it. I don't really ever like going to the doctors about things, but if things keep going narrating themselves in this consistent fashion, then I may have no other alternative.  What worries me most is that, today especially, if someone would have asked me to carry something, I would most probably have dropped it, or not even clench it in the first place. At least it's something not typical I need worry about now, and not tiresome emotional issues. Good to be back *gulps* xBuBzx

						     Celebrity "Woodstock" Deathmatch     This time at Woodstock . . .  Johnny Gomez: Ladies and Gentlemen, Nick Diamond and myself are right in front of the set and we're live at Woodstock where a scheduled Celebrity Deathmatch is to take place anytime now between Nine Inch Nails' Reznor Reznor and limpbizkit's frontman Durst Durst.  Nick Diamond: No one's performing at the moment on the stage, but the fans are all pumped up for the fight.  It looks like Reznor and Durst are going to determine everything tonight.  And we can hear the music being played... It's "Hot Dog".  And Durst comes out from the side and the crowd goes wild.  Apparently, he looks exhausted from a performance he might have had earlier, but he's never too tired for a good fight!  Johnny: What's this we're hearing?  A techno tune, only increasing in sound... it's "Starfuckers, Inc."!  And that's Reznor Reznor.  The people are fanatical, roaring "Nine-Inch-Nails! Nine-Inch-Nails!"   Nick: We've come to know that this is his first public appearance in almost four years!  Johnny: Both of them onstage together for the very first time!  The lights are flashing and the music still audible, but where's Mills Lane?  Oh, there goes the referee right by us, and he's getting up onstage.   Mills Lane: Now you two, you obviously know the rules, so look around you and take notice of all the instruments lying around.  Ready or not, let's get it on!  : And it has begun.  Nick, this going to awesome, I haven't scene a Deathmatch venue of this kind before!  Nick: Yeah.  This sure is going to be one good fight, and because of their experience onstage they'll know exactly how to use the tools!  It's time to go stage side!  Reznor, wearing his trademark 'Evil Inside' t-shirt and khaki shorts, walks around the stage; it looks like he's thinking about something.  Maybe it's nostalgia that’s getting to him.  Or maybe he's just familiarizing himself with the set for more serious reasons.  On the other side, Durst seems to be signing autographs?!  But now he sees Reznor glaring at him so he goes towards Reznor with a mic.  Durst: Reznor 'Nine Inch Nails' Reznor, we finally meet to end this stupid feud of yours. And it's time to show everyone who's the best man at Interscope Records!  Reznor takes the mic away from Durst and kicks him in the midsection.  Reznor: You wanna fuck me like an animal, eh?  You like to burn me on the inside?  You like to think that I'm a perfect drug!?  Reznor tosses the mic aside, picks Durst up and throws him across the stage and into the drum kit.  Nick: There's some action!  Reznor's infamous habit of thrashing his own instruments onstage may very well prove useful tonight!  But look at Durst... he's up already but what's he taking out there...it's some sort of a slimy substance and it's star shaped?  Durst throws the object at Reznor and it automatically sticks onto Reznor's face.  With Reznor's face now covered with that slimy object, he can't see anything and he's screaming and running around in circles.  Johnny: Oh my God, it's a poisonous starfish!  What a move by Durst!  Nick: What's Reznor feeling right now, Johnny?  Johnny: Well, it appears that Reznor is currently in great pain due to the venom released right on his face by the starfish.  With great swelling and redden areas of skin, the one-man-band member requires serious medical attention right now if he's to even survive!  Reznor is found falling over instruments and scraping his face against the stage amplifiers.  Durst, on the other hand, starts taunting and posing before the crowd in triumph.  Nick: Look at Reznor...he's got the starfish off of his face!  Reznor can be seen holding the remains of the starfish.  But his face looks quite ugly, or rather it's just got the pink slime and/or colour of the obliterated starfish; Reznor's still trying to gain visual consciousness.  Most of the crowd are in awe, but some are chanting unknown verses of various limpbizkit songs while cheering for Durst.  Johnny: What is Reznor thinking?  He should just go and push Durst off the stage!  Reznor takes out a double barrelled gun.  By the time Durst gets back to Reznor, Reznor is found pointing the gun at Durst, and loading the gun with large nails.  Nick: What's that? It's a huge gun and look what he's putting in it!  Johnny: Apparently they are nine inch nails, quite literally, and he's holding a nail gun!  And the nails have some sort of sticky material all over them.  Nick: Oh, he must have used those nails to scrape off that starfish!  Johnny: As messy as the match has already been, with these two it seems like there can only be room for more!  Reznor, having loaded the double barreled machine of a gun, starts aiming all over Durst's body while Durst, with his legs crossed, tries to move in different directions only to find out that there's no way to escape Reznor onstage.  Johnny: Reznor can play on like this throughout the night; he's got Durst scared straight.  But where's Mills, Nick?  Nick: Good question, where is he?!  Johnny: There he is, right at the end of Durst's side of the stage... and he's lying unconscious!  Out of nowhere, Richard Patrick appears, jumps on stage, and kicks Reznor in the back.  Reznor falls but, luckily, is still holding the gun.  Patrick kicks the gun away from Reznor and takes it into his possession.  Now holding the gun, he points to the centre of the stage.  Patrick: You and your stupid sets!  It's not even worth taking a picture!  And Patrick starts shooting nails at the instruments.  The nails only ricochet and deflect back onto him.  He's fairly injured but not out, yet.  Nick: Johnny, this is quite the occurrence.  But who's going to benefit from all of this!  Johnny: I don't know, but look over there! It's limpbizkit's ex-guitarist, Wes Borland!  Borland jumps onto the stage from amongst the crowd, holding a guitar of his own make.  He slams the guitar on Durst's head, who had been staring at Borland in disbelief.  Borland then grabs Durst and drags him off the side of the stage.  Reznor, now up, runs over and past Patrick's body and jumps at Borland.  Reznor: Durst's mine!  Borland takes a shot at Reznor with the guitar, but misses.  And in return Reznor quickly picks up a keyboard that was fortunately laying next to him and breaks it over Borland's head.  Johnny: Oh, did you hear the crowd as Borland's head exploded?  Nick: Indeed, Johnny... that was nasty!  With Borland out of the scene, Reznor drags Durst to the centre where Patrick is apparently stuck to the floor.  Patrick: Ah, Reznor!  Help me out man!  Reznor throws Durst over Patrick's body, pins Durst down with his leg, and picks up the nail gun.  Nick: Reznor just won't answer Richard Patrick's screams for help!  Filter's singer is in serious pain!  Reznor points the nail gun at the two helpless opponents and shoots, only to find that the gun lacks ammo.  Reznor: Damn it, Richard! You wasted all the nails...  Johnny: Nick look, Mills is up and he's going straight at Reznor!  Mills: Now what's going on here? You wanna finish off Durst with that gun?  Johnny: And the crowd goes silent...  Mills: I'll allow it!  From behind referee Mills, a box of nails comes sliding over to Reznor.  Reznor starts staring at Mills, trying to look around him to determine where the nails came from.  And out of nowhere appears Marilyn Manson.  The crowd grows even louder.  Johnny: What else could a crowd ask for?  They've seen it all!  Nick: Look at Reznor smile and nod at Manson.  Reznor reloads the gun and holds it up.  Durst: Reznor you...!  Before Durst can even complete his sentence, Reznor fires shots at Durst, and even finishes off Patrick.  Reznor hands the gun over to Mills.  Mills: Hmm... nice gun.  And the winner is... Trent Reznor!  With "Starfuckers, Inc." playing again, Reznor and Manson leave the stage and walk off into the crowd.  Johnny: What a night this has been.  With interferences from three other artists and Mills unknowingly falling unconscious, this has truly been a whole different Deathmatch altogether!  Reznor was deservedly victorious at the end.  Nick: Yes, Johnny.  It looks like Reznor can start concentrating on making music again.  And who knows, maybe Reznor and Manson are headed to Reznor's recording studio right now!  Johnny: Who knows?  But we do know that this concludes a rather incredible edition of Celebrity Deathmatch. Live from Woodstock, I'm Johnny Gomez.  Nick: And I'm Nick Diamond.  Johnny: Good fight...good night! xBuBzx

						   College seems fun now I'm a big old 6.2. Not like anyone else being in my shoes feels different either but . . .  England was really good last night, at the home of football (Stamford bridge of course) with me and Ian making the shed bar's faithful howl in laughter on regular occasions, without my knowledge it must be said (I had downed several large beverages by this point) was grand. It was great to hear them say "FUCK OF TO THE BOG MATE THEY SCORE WHEN YOUR NOT HERE" where upon everyone attuned into raptuous laughter.  Now we play Portugal, with even more booze flowing between me and Ian, at hopefully, a considerably larger volume of noise, even compared to last night.  Speaking of Ian, form what he tells me last night, He and Tracy (his girlfriend no less) and a camp fellow by the name of Jon are going to move into a little apartment in Mitcham somewhere, and Ian wants me to come stay there, to back up the presence of "hetro masculinity" (why can't he open his eyes and just see I'm hardly that stereotype am I?!?!). This has all come about due to Tracy's family are moving to Brighton, and I've wanted to meet her and talk to her about young Ian for quite a while now (as has everyone Ian, if you'd just trust us poor folk). So I'm caught up at a crossroads to see whether I want to grow up overnight (in Mitcham of all places), or to just stay in the tried and trusted Molesey. I just have to mull intensely for the next few days me thinks.  Thomas seems to be getting more and more adorable by the day, and I think I really like this one, so I might play it not as casual with him from now on. I really want it to work,  even  God must know this by now.  There is sweet FA to do for the next half an hour until 2 and a half hours of super duper Keith man philosopher takes us on another adventure of deep thought and provocation, so I guess I'll just read the times until then. Ciao. xBuBzx

						   My head is not that much dislike the poor soul in my title link . . .  I had the first controversial on this blog late last night, from Erd (Jo's "boyfriend"), which I was greatly amused over. I mean firstly, who calls there child Erd, and secondly, who doesn't run to the nearest deed-poll station when they finally realize how stupid it is. Anyway, Jo from what she told me, despises this guys carcass anyway, which makes it all the more surprising that he is still so into her, you'd have thought he would have got the message by now but hey, what are you going to do, he is a guy after all, just innately stupid.  On a lighter not, the second week of the block time table has started, with me losing the third copy of the timetable, and coming in 2 hours early for everything, which isn't a great start to the week by all admission, but It's England tonight with Ian, Dan and Ali (maybe) in "the blue room" opposite the shed bar in Chelsea. I'm looking forward to it to be honest after such a dreadful weekend.  Well the weekend wasn't that bad anyway, I've been talking to this extremely attractive guy in every sense called Thomas (not Tom thank God, that name conjures bad memories of Halliford), who is friends of Pippa, who I just want to say "awww" and "hehe" like a giggling school girl, every time I think about him, as well as fuck him senseless, but I guess that goes without saying when you meet a new guy.  It's psychology for like the first time in a month at quarter past one, which should give me a good chance to catch up with Messrs, Amicia, Sarah and Suzanne etc which should be cool considering I need a long chat with them about men and Jo and how much Steve looks like a chipmunk every time we see him. LRC seems to be bursting with people, so I'll be of, I guess I'll just mull over a broad sheet, or whatever the smaller version of them are called these days. xBuBzx

						   Work was quite bearable for a fathers day and the evident attachment of paternal ass kissing that all children must endure amidst these most tormenting of hours.  I actually discovered a friend who fitted into none of the several categories I put forward to you yesterday - Rachel. Although she has the same flaws as the others, just in different ways. I think she knows like Frances and Anna that she is indeed one of the stunningly beautiful people and that could have twisted her imagination, not that she or anyone else would be consciously aware of it if they were in her situation. She just never seems to be up for going out, or ever asks even whether we could meet for a drink or something outside college and work. Well I decided after a long and hard think during till service that it's not worth really trusting anything, Or D.T.A as one famous wrestler would say.  I also got thinking as I often do in my day dreaming there, about what qualities would I like to have perfected by the time I'm as old as the oracle, and well I still need to think about it for a while. Meh, I'll tell all when the football's finished xBuBzx

						     Rock's endangered species - why alternative needs your help    "...bowing out early is one of the best things that can happen to a Cultural Icon.  He or she will be deemed "Voice of a Generation," and grief-stricken fans will hold candlelight vigils and anniversary memorials for years to come."  Above:  Michael Abernethy, "The Real Significance of Kurt Cobain "  Every April, the floodgates are opened; millions of enduring Nirvana (especially Kurt Cobain) devotees privately and publicly express their equally enduring gratitude for the late pioneer of not only the grunge genre but an altogether unique approach to musicianship, rock performance, and dare I say, life itself.  But the clichés have been reported since 1994 (perhaps earlier), and each year the response is the same: Kurt Cobain was indeed an icon, a visionary, a heroin addict, and a scrawny 20-something-year-old.  Where does that leave the passionately loyal, if diminished, audience still bent on maintaining his legacy?  According to Michael Abernethy, author of the aforementioned PopMatters column, "The Real Significance of Kurt Cobain," a cycle of icons will continue with each generation: "[L]egacies change over time.  When one icon passes, someone else steps in to fill the void, even as music buyers of one generation grow up, and the next generation finds someone new to represent their particular concerns."  The unfortunate reality is that Nirvana was part of a finite generation, one that would either fade with the band's unexpected dissolution or the natural passage of time and fickle music fans.  Nevertheless, the grunge era was indeed cut short.  Now, only one day of the year is specifically dedicated to an artist and human being who struggled, survived, and even died on a daily basis.  Why have we disengaged ourselves from his life?  Is it the fragmentation of the current late teens to mid-20s generation, the supposed need to fit oneself into a "distinct" community, whether it be based on fashion, music, or crack?  Is it the decayed state of alternative music, molded in part by the increasingly popular hipster sub-culture of independent music?  Or is it just laziness on the part of young eyes and ears, an audience corrupted by a bite-size attention span and a lust for whatever might be cool?  A disease usually has multiple symptoms, and this diagnosis is no different, but my particular concerns of alternative decay, unconscious fans, and divisive sub-culturalism are the primary ailments.  In a post-MACHINA II interview, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Zwan, and now just himself laments the loss of the alternative community: "The idea of the integrity, the idea of what it means to be in a band, the idea that you have to walk right and be right because you got to stand up not just for yourself but for your community — that's all gone, that’s just out the window."  In the fallout of such noteworthy acts as the Pumpkins, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, and Soundgarden, a trend within the alternative circle cropped up as certain members of the aforementioned bands joined together to continue the march: A Perfect Circle and Audioslave are two of the recent media-termed supergroups to include hallmark musicians.  Additionally, current acts Radiohead and Tool continue to create.  With such bands recording and touring on a relatively consistent basis, one would consider modern (or rather postmodern) music to be more than just alive and breathing.  Yet, it is undeniable that Audioslave is no where near the significance (yet?) of its two predecessors.  Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters may be a solid enough group for popular listeners, but there is no doubt that his previous role casts far too big a shadow upon any future projects.  And the Pixies' recent touring and newly released material?  While the nostalgic sensibilities of 80s and 90s alt-fans are already roused, what is the band returning to?  Certainly not the musical climate of their prime years.  Same goes for Fountain of Youth drinkers, Sonic Youth, who are impressively looming upon twenty albums.  Nevertheless, Sonic Nurse is preparing us for their approaching finale.  It comes down to an observation of the past two decades and, more importantly, the past few years.  Yes, Morrissey's You Are the Quarry is incredible, but much like Sonic Youth, the Smiths vocalist is no sapling (he's hitting 50 in a few years).  Although it is not too late — nor is it ever — to begin buying past records of vital artists, the surrounding community is no longer together.  When Tool releases their next album in 2005, it will be one of the few important reminders of just how high alternative music was a decade ago and how low it has sunk since.  Alternative music's slow decay cannot be simply attributed to aging artists however; the other side of the equation — the audience — is an equally necessary component.  Enter cultural fragmentation: musical genres have long served as tangible indicators of personality, as well as carvers of popular trends.  MTV's video countdowns are essentially indoctrinations of cool, the popular music the popular people are downlo... or rather buying, since online file-sharing is an extinct beast (sure, RIAA). Even the sub-culture of hipster-independent music is being dug up by MTV's Advance Warning; the underground caverns are seeing much more light these days (Pitchfork Media receives 80,000 visitors a day and 500,000 a month).  Hip music listeners have discovered that TRL attendance is not as necessary as owning that indie debut no one else has even heard of.  Knowledge is cool, right?  As much as sub-cultures shift and re-align, fragmentation and division will continue to permeate youth generations.  Specifically, independent music has long been regarded as an inherently exclusive club, its members pompous know-it-alls of those bands far outside the mainstream.  After all, it is cool to own The Notwist's Neon Golden — that is, until your neighbors start listening as well.  Is this musical superiority complex justified for those ardent fans who do research a band's cryptic metaphors, memorize the lyrics, attend multiple shows on the same tour (and perhaps help load the band's amplifiers into what could be called a piece of abstract metal art with wheels), and attempt to actually understand and utilize the aforementioned band as a potential source of inspiration for their own lifestyles, whether it be in painting, politics, or just moseying around?  The distinction lies in both the artist and the audience, and this is where alternative begins to shine more brilliantly than any rock genre.  Nevermind.  The commercial apex of Nirvana's career.  On one hand, an expansive opportunity for millions of people to experience what the grunge underground had already discovered since the band's 1989 debut, Bleach.  On another, the boiling point of Nirvana's publicity and mainstream popularity, fueled by a single millions moshed to but barely understood.  But who really cared anyway?  Kurt Cobain was onstage smashing his guitar and huddling into a corner!  Cool, right?  There is performance art and there is suffering; both appeal to an audience, but only one stops when the lights return.  An audience's interaction with an artist's output is an emotive exchange between the two parties, one determining the extent of the artist's significance and the depth to which the audience attempts to honestly see the artist.  It is easy to simply idolize and adore, perhaps too easy.  The current realization of fandom is based on a hierarchy, the artist situated above the audience as opposed to on an equal plain, an equal level of exchange.  Imagine if the original intention of a fan was not to be entertained, roused, or disturbed but simply inspired to tangibly apply the energy of the art to the fan’s own work.  If a generation's premier artists are considered links in a larger historical chain, the audience will realize its role in perpetuating that chain.  Alternative music has historically constructed itself as a sequence of diverse links, from British post-punk to American guitar rock.  There's a signature style to alternative, an awareness of the importance and responsibility invested by being in a band and writing certain songs.  Ian Curtis knew it, Kurt Cobain knew it, and Maynard James Keenan knows it today.  While none of those artists stuck to their underground scenes, each carried an undeniable significance; independent is by no means a determinant of alternative.  A dozen vague notions can be used to describe the worth of alternative, but it simply boils down to an altogether different way of approaching music: not just as a career, or even a lifestyle; just about every popular band claims to "do it all for the music."  It is the depth to which one will go to achieve an ordinary life amidst extraordinary circumstances: fan idolization, millions of dollars, and tours across the globe.  It is the sincerity and consistency of communication one is willing to make with his/her audience — an exchange as opposed to a lecture.  It is art-centric as opposed to artist-centric or even audience-centric.  It is art for art's sake, a form characterized by distinct aesthetics and particular ideals — music as a tool of consciousness, a method of living, playing, and working — and those ideals are what define alternative as a music genre, a mindset, and a worldview.  Where has independent music gone wrong then?  As with many genres — including alternative — images of the typical artist and fan emerge.  A list of ways to be "alternative" is compiled.  It becomes more of a societal decision than a personal one, and cultural division inevitably erupts over who is truly "alternative."  The same thing has happened to gothic and punk ethics; the question of sincerity is raised, and no one is willing to compromise.  While punk is historically rooted in its earliest pioneers, independent music essentially has no roots; it is literally defined by the band being on an independent label.  It is only through modern characterizations that indie music has taken on cutting edge connotations and rebel art aesthetics: "Yes, we are on an independent label, and because of that we are inherently better than that major label artist."  It is part of the often fragile youth resistance to corporate control and multinationals; not only is it difficult for any kid to grow up in America without tapping into the capitalist vein, but it is ridiculous to claim that independent labels somehow fight the already-present conglomerates (offer frequently more liberating contracts, yes, but not fight).  Because "indie" has become a misguided synonym for "brilliant" to many similarly misguided listeners, alternative music is at a loss: is it possible to express that integrity discussed by Billy Corgan when on a major label?  Obviously so, and assuming a band takes complete creative control — which it should — over its music, artwork, and tours, the label has nothing to do with a band's ability.  While independent labels are important caretakers of emerging artists, the unfortunate disadvantage is one of access.  The indie underground is an infamously private sector, and many fans are simply unaware of promising bands working towards greater exposure.  The fight should not be one of fan access but rather artistic control under a major label; if a Capitol Records band — such as Radiohead — can retain total authority over its output, their statement can be made to a broader audience.  True, the fan base will increase, inevitably pooling in trendy fans who appreciate a band (take MTV's alternative pet, Coldplay) as long as it is hip, but indie music as an exclusive genre as opposed to a stepping stone is only a divisive example of generational fragmentation.  Many of the premier alt-rock artists of the 80s and 90s were by no means indie bands throughout their careers.  They often began in underground scenes, drawing from their respective cities, but an honest band understands the natural diffusion of music, the locomotive quality of expanding art and not restricting it to an audience based solely on geographic or socio-economic access.  Before I step off my soapbox, I want to clarify something: I by no means hate independent music or its role within popular culture.  I just know that in 1993 Siamese Dream was released, and I had no idea.  Yes, I was eight years old, but still... there's something remarkably sad knowing that I was alive when Billy Corgan was striving for that fabled integrity, but I was just a grade-schooler, unaware and uncaring.  Kurt Cobain died the following year, and once again, I was in a classroom at St. Michael School, unaware and uncaring.  I have no doubt that alternative music meant something more during the late 80s to mid 90s, and I am hoping that the cliché of history repeating itself does in fact hold some truth.  Alternative, much like punk, is an ethic all by itself, a lens of perception, a way of thinking, and a general understanding.  It is not just a music genre, and my hope is that more bands understand that broader connotation of rock n' roll.  I sincerely believe it is worth it. xBuBzx

						   I'm a little less drained than I was last time I blogged, but I'm still struggling to keep the eye lids from ceasing up permanently, so I'll keep it short and sweet. It's the last day of college and I've just had the most nightmarishly horrible key skills presentation (God knows how you can call it a presentation when Steve is interrupting you on a second-ly basis) but I managed to come out in one piece so now I'm happy and looking forward to Thomas, summer and a bit less one way criticism from Dad about work. Oh, but alas, that can't be since Mother decided to do a "Rachael" (and no I don't mean turn into a closet lesbian) and cry over the littlest thing, which obviously, as everyone knows,  WILL  be my fault, even if it was because she can't handle menopause, like an achoholic lightweight can't handle 10 pints in a minute.  I presume that this will be my last ever blog from the LRC, which is sad considering I actually like the solitude in here, if not the slowness of the broadband.  Eraser  is gently screaming through my ear lobes, so I guess It's of to read what Giles Smith has to say in  The Times , or was it the guy with the beard? I'm not sure; anyway, many things to discuss tonight once my brain is in a farther wider frame of contemplation xBuBzx

One bad thing would be that I don't get to spend my lessons thinking about the gorgeous Anna beside me *meh*. However now I guess I'm really stuck as what to do with the rest of my life.

						     Nine Inch Nails: We're In This Together    I've become impossible, holding on to when, when everything seemed to matter more, the two of us, all used and beaten up, watching fate as it flow down the path we, have chose.  You and me, we're in this together now, none of them can stop us now, we will make it through somehow, you and me, if the world should break in two, until the very end of me, until the very end of you.  Awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin, they pick and they pull, trying to get their fingers in, well they've got to kill what we've found, well they've got to hate what we fear, well they've got to make it go away, well they've got to make it disappear.  The farther I fall I'm beside you, as lost as I get I will find you, the deeper the wound I'm inside you, for ever and ever I'm a part of.  You and me, we're in this together now, none of them can stop us now, we will make it through somehow, you and me, if the world should break in two, until the very end of me, until the very end of you.  All that we were is gone we have to hold on, all that we were is gone we have to hold on, when all our hope is gone we have to hold on, all that we were is gone but we can hold on.  You and me, we're in this together now, none of them can stop us now, we will make it through somehow, you and me, even after everything, you're the queen and I'm the king, nothing else means anything. xBuBzx

Anyway, my gig whore returned late last night thank God, and enough said really on how I began to feel amidst the dying embers of the weekend, after I returned from viewing Muse's stunning performance of the pyramid stage at Glastonbury, too see my little traxlover online (-:.  Feeling have definitely cooled back at home, we're basically talking on a normal playing feel, although it will never be happy families incarnate there, that's for sure.  I'm supposed to have this sociology key skills and coursework done and dusted by Thursday morning, however it all seems quite pointless doing any of it really considering I won't even be there next year anyway.

						   I took the step up in my manual self-IT education today and completely assembled this computer from scratch after the Mother got in a hissy fit and  tried  to take away my PC. I mean, what on God's green Earth would I do if the internet suddenly disappeared one day, write a book, talk to myself - or worse a sock-puppet?  I am due to go to a gig with Jen tomorrow, but I'm not sure since she would have only just returned from the business trip to Paris to engage in the mass cocaine transportation shenanigan. Alas I may just be stuck in doors again, much like this weekend, after a huge blow out from a wide verity of friends and an argument with Mother; you would have thought by now that my spirits would be down and grounded into minuscule fractions, but I just put things into prospectus and everything seemed a little calm and more relaxed/peaceful, which was a good self-emotion/reaction if I can repeat it again on countless occasions coming up over the next year.  Ian is asking me for a deposit of $250 if I want in on the place in Mitcham, and I've been thinking long and hard at work and afterwards If It's a good idea to take it or not, and at the moment I'm quite keen, but it really depends on a number of factors and seeing whether they fall through or anything, which I'll discuss in detail tomorrow probably.

						   10.30 am - The polyphonic trumpet ring-tone on my god awful Samsung goes with "Kate" buzzing on and of.   "Oh God" I said. "I'm so sorry I've got a throbbing headache and I've only just woken up - I'm really sorry."  Then with my eardrums barely awake, they shudder at the Canning town accent, reminiscent of the girls that Barron hangs around with - "uurr ly-in".  "I'm really sorry Kate, I'll try and make it up to yo . . . " - the line crackles and she has hung up in her arrogant - I'm fitter than you because I've got died blond hair, and fake gold jewelry and £1.20 foundation with classy vocabulary in everything I say, and I'm of to suck Michaels cock so he'll beat up this boy who's been giving me "beef" kind of way.  So the previous evening, Dad had come marching in to the study proclaiming "BE HERE AND WE'LL HAVE LUNCH AT ONE!", which obviously bought a large grin upon his several chin-ridden face.  So anyway, last night was rather a bore, with the German being ill, It was spent in, and a extreme early night, especially for me of 7 o'clock. Although I did awake suddenly as I got a call from an old friend - Lauren, who no is living with a new bad boy and thankfully out of that shithole of a home of hers, and so should sometime meet up with her somewhere.  Tonight should be better however, as the German is feeling rather better and we plan to go mass drinking for the first official day of summer. HOORAH! xBuBzx

						   I can safely say I've grasped the notion of "dead end job" and all of it's little PC additives, which in many aspects intensify the unbearability of it. However the Covent Gardenesque area is quite contemporary and most definitely my cup of tea, even if the accent and taste in clothes shop of my partner in crime, Kate, isn't as such.  So why dead end you say? Well, frankly I've never been a huge fanatic of the the postal slave labour trade, however there have been occasional moments of joy - such as serving tea and biscuits to the junior school teachers, and the staff all seem rather friendly and polite and in full awareness of there 200+ IQs, which can come in handy if they had a mischievous side to them including money laundering and transportation of illegal immigrants and alike. Alas they are all law abiding citizens, and lovely one's really. However, if there has been some advantage to the whole experience, which I value the most, is seeing how I can improve my overall poetry (well sex poetry) and general literary skills I reckon.  I feel I've gotten to know Kate somewhat, and I've changed my opinion on her somewhat from the stagnate blond townie from TL at Esher, to someone who has somewhere, an inner beauty about her. Well I did say somewhere - didn't I? Other things which come to mind about the place - I shall most definitely rant/bitch upon tonight.  Since days have lasted from 10/10:30 - 5:30/6 respectively, maintaining a consistent social/blogging life hasn't been the easiest of things, however I did manage to live up to my promise for Rowan, and see his ever improving band and band support (even though half of them are pretentious in the closet twats) -  Lunatic Crash  at the  Half Moon  in Putney. The drum/guitar/vocal-screeching solos seem to be gathering improving speed, and volume and, well class to be honest. If there's anyone from school who's going to make it in the music industry, it will be Rowan, and I should suspect, in Lunatic Crash.  I discovered, as did Erd, what Jo is really like a couple of days ago, so we are deciding to give as good as we got, and raise the volume on the compliment so to speak - I'll update you on that later.  I have no idea what is going on between me and Thomas, and to my joy (and probably his as well) neither do I care as much as the days haul on, I really hate things ceasing before they've even really begun which is apparently what seems to be happening again, which strangely enough, the title of this webpage should sum up in an instant. My friends like E and more recently Jen are far more important to me, especially at the moment, and God knows I want to know these lovelies until I have hair growing from my ear lobes. Sentimental I'm sure. It was quite fascinating to see, from my point of view, when seeing both the friends I've got since joining Esher, and the Halliford patheticos, and really seeing how much more I value the new regime in my life. Take for instance talking to Richard. Now conversation has never been that boys strong point, much like myself, but seeing his weak feeble attempt at humor amidst his " Nawberry " and his lackluster conversational skills (worse than when he was 11 for crying out loud), I could finally, once and for all (well close enough but not 100% there I guess) put those 5 years to rest. Lets see when the time passes, that night really tipped the scales between recovery and happiness. xBuBzx

						   I promised that I'd return and post something LoVeLy about squabbo hunny, and I will, however a small rant may just be needed before breath is drawn.  I have the feeling, or I know that I'm really nervous about telling Ian whenever I see him sometime this week, and you know what  it is  so I shaln't divulge any more upon you poor soles.  Well, where to begin?  Ah yes, when Dan and  "Wadan"  Jess Law and Ali decided to stay at mine that strange night. It was all dandy really and I managed to have a proper chat with jess for a bit, well I say proper but it was more of an information bitch about stuff I've never really opened up to her about before. Then the "white wannabe rudies" she so glamorously denounced them all (except Law) decided it was a grand ol'plan to hide my keys, which enticed Father into all sorts of emotionally charged cliches (blaming myself for it a.s.a.p) and so I had to foot the £7 for there faults as human beings. It's not just the £7, it's the principle of it, and Dan decided against re-embersing me with the sterling, electing instead, to use the sly-alternative and blame me for a Kessalar self-inflicted loss of a couple of quid.  Anyway the day later was the final exam in Maths which went rather swell, and then to Sutton with E to search for jobs what'shats not. We counted an average - slag per 10 seconds, which curiously was backed in the claim by a kind gentleman who was maticulous in his examination of the McDonalds branch in the high street and came to pretty much the same conclusion we arrived at, which was rather fun to discover. Clink  urlLink here  to discover more.  The Friday night wasn't all that great, Thomas was in the end, busy with his kittens and so, me and Anna waited to greet her new lover; BB5 Stuart wannabe Carl to arrive at Paddington, no later than 2 AND A HALf HOURS LATE! So no sin city and certainly no threesome. I ended up In Barbara's bed (Anna's Mum) which was quite a shock at 10 the following morning. It was however nice to see a certain  Chris Tarrent  at the breakfast table, discussing all thing television and alike with Barbara, and as it turned out, he was a rather down-to-earth bloke from start to finish.  Saturday was a night for me and Ian to engage in our extremely unique conversation, in which absolutely no-one apart from me and Ian would ever appreciate fully, which is just swell for the time being, not when, or if I ever move to SW8. We then upon leaving the German, saw Shrek 2, which despite it's brilliant prequel, was an outstanding film, easily outstanding its elder from start to finish.  Sunday involved me thinking of Thomas (oh shit I'll just do the post about him tomorrow evening  I SWEAR ) and strangely of school, and blank empty insomniac periods of null.  The poetry society beckons for this weeks adventure . . . xBuBzx

						   This week has drained my mental capacity and motivation for writing in this blog, so I'll just leave it a bit short.  As I've been recovering somewhat in all areas, I tend to become terribly reflective and subdued, so I've spent most of my time thinking of Thomas, and how I can tell Ian that I'm bi. It's really important I just get it out of the way, I hate being so late out of the closet it just ripes me apart. Perhaps school would have been bearable if I did it in year 10 and not have given two flying fu . . . well you get the picture. I Promise as God is my whitness I'll post something meaningful and lengthy about him tomorrow - he deserves it because he's been overly nice and lovely to me, and I want him badly now. xBuBzx

						   A man is lying in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young nurse enters his room to sponge his face and hands. "Nurse," he mumbles from behind the mask, "Are my testicles black?" Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know Mr. Jones, I'm only here to wash your face and hands." He struggles again to ask, "Nurse, are my testicles black?" Again the nurse replies, "I can't tell. I'm only here to wash your face and hands." The head nurse walks by and sees the man getting a little distraught, so she marches over to find out what's wrong. "Nurse," he mumbles, "are my testicles black?" The head nurse whips back the sheets, pulls down the man's pajamas, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas and says, "There's nothing wrong with them." Frustrated at this, the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again, "I said, are my test results back?!" xBuBzx

						     BuBz Diet Update  : today was OK, however I did feel quite bored with nothing to do at home, however waking at 3 in the afternoon did the whol thing a world of good. I had a big soup and 2 glasses of fizzy flavoured water and a chili from Mother and afterwards a yogurt and several microwaved pieced of plain brown bread (which actually tasted rather better than you might expect).  I felt rather out of energy today, and I hither to guess that it was a combination of a lack of binge eating, and work last night. Nothing else radical to report, apart from I'm trying to think of what filsm to bring to Jen and myself film whoring tomorrow evening. I fancy something epic/horror fuelled. This could involve that Sam Neill film I saw once when I was half asleep which was just AWESOME (so after this a half hours research to get the title and availability of this beauty). Wel that and fight club and american history x and HELLRAISER!!! MwAh. xBuBzx

						   After months of self-aggressive-negotiations, well about a years worth of gradual weight gain, it's time to get back to something in the last 2 years I have excelled at - starvatio-anorexomanialysing (and what a word you must agree). I was talking with Tony (the resident Tesco security guard) about my swelling balloon tummy, and I have to lose this waist-line and appetite and overall consumption - it's not fair on me, Mother and Father, or my bank balance for that matter.  So, this will be my devilish concoct, well in a draft stage at least, commencing as of 7pm yesterday evening once wise old Tony gave me his personalised diet  plan pack , amidst some personal input I must admit:  - Nothing fizzy (Tony) - Nothing fatty at tesco breaks (Me) - Cycle to work this summer (Tony) - No sugary/salty food (Tony) - More worthwhile occupying activities i.e drugs (E's especially) and work (Me obviously) - Attempt to use household workout gear like the rowing machine (Me) - 3 meals a day (Tony and Me).  So there done, this blog will end if I fail it . . .  A punishment of the highest order.  On another topic, I'm ready for a holiday - the easy part there - saying it. Now going on it will be a completely separate issue. I want somewhere sunny to get a tan and alike, a weekend or a few days in Europe is something I've done and done again and again with Mother and Father, so Ian's timeshare could come in handy. Although I feel as though there isn't nearly enough time to get a proper holiday organised, so I will have to make do with Reading again as my solitary vacation. Alas, despite 3 years since my last holiday, something will work itself out nearer Christmas time. I mean I have plenty on my plate here to keep me occupied and busy until the time where I'm in absolute desperation for a plane trip.  Work was OKish tonight I guess, although Becky's claws still hadn't smoothed of completely, I still loved mentally kicking her ass in my mind, when the customers passing through. You really should see the world I delve of into when I'm there. Makes Heaven look like a shrinking violet. xBuBzx

						    Words, phrases and overall sentences may be dramaticised by your truly for self-comical purposes, and hopefully to piss you of.     Saturday 2.00pm    The evil Samsung vibrates with "Anna Home" shining into my eyes.  "Hewwo my little gorgeous German, what's up?" "I have a dilemma - I need some help" "Sure what's up?" "Well (in a vulnerable considerate voice), could you for a start not keep calling me German please, I'm not even fully German, only 3 quarters, you know that" "I'll take it into consideration; anyway, what  really  bothering you my dear" About ten seconds worth of awkward silence followed, eventually with it being broken by - "Jade's stuck in Marseilles with no money - can she have 140 euros from  your  debit card Mat, you'd be really helping her out." "Well I don't have a debit card for a start" "Well can you get your Dads, and like not let him know?" My eyes begin to roll and my lips start a long drawn out "PFFFF" down the phone to her to say "you know I can't do that, or lend her 140 euros anyway, it's her fault she's got herself into that situation anyway; anyho, do you want to go clubbing tonight? "Sure!"  So we did.  Up on arriving at Highbury and Isslington,  had a drunken hobo keep calling me fat Matty Matty fat, to which people really just wanted to there and then spit at this parasite of society, and so I stumped a menthol cigarette into his hand, which felt devilishly fabulous. Then me Anna, Fluffy, and  the guy who lived above the station at Highbury and Isslington  went to Slimelight and clubbed it hard electronic Goth style hard for 9 hours straight.  Anyway *giggles to himself* beside that most of the night sped by as I mixed the industrial and dark wave room and Monsters inc, in the cinema hall, which even, at my great fucked stage of the night, was pretty fucking cool damn it.  I've really missed the days of trying to sneak into that place at 14, through the back door, without the security noticing. It's really got better in the last few years, and for once, I felt at home with a cute guy near me, a non-judgmental/remotely townie crowd surrounding that with me in my old Goth clothes, cherished immensely.  I guess I feel quite sentimental at this moment, so I guess I must, If I don't ay it enough that I love you Anna so much, no matter how much I tease you or come of so weird, I could just hold you in my arms until sunrise everyday I was alive hehe.   Anyway, I was knackered by 7:30, so I headed back for a 2 hour journey to home . . .  Only to get ready for a 6 HOUR DRAG AT WORK, where Becky sniffed out my fatigue as soon as her fat arse walked through the automatic doors and made sure, with much more precision than usual, to punish with an ECOH warning (each customer offered help bullshit/PC thing i.e pointless, pathetic pompus notion) and to which, she stressed, meant that if I received a further two, I would have to be re-trained; (most probably by her no less) which (she forgets) would be the easiest 4 hours paid work of my life. Stupid bitch. xBuBzx

						   Spiderman 2 was rather better than I thought, and with Amy falling asleep in my arms, it felt rather like comfort viewing.  However, I was feeling most pleased with how the day was going until Mother pranced in after a short conversation with Andrew on the phone. Now despite me not having seen Harry for a month, the little tiger bless him has been complaining to his school teacher that I have been hitting him in the last few days, which brought a whale of tear drenched emotion from Mothers eyes for near on 45 minutes. Why 45 minutes you say; well because everytime we delve into some heated exchange of "words", everything seems to go pearshaped and digress into other areas of my life, one's which should have been (in her mind) put to bed. She often suggests the notion that I should see a counselor, and if not that a psychiatrist, and if not that a psychologist, and if not that, well heavens above, Father *sarcastic gulp*.  Well with my daily ranting over, it's been a good day to be honest, met a swell guy called Wayne who was Amy's friend and had a childish/fun day in Kingston, and tomorrow I travel to see the German, and I think I might ask her out now or once she's single. I don't mean by any stretch of the imagination, to sound cocky or arrogant, but I think for sure she'd say yes considering I know her really well these days; and 3 quarters of the time I can complete her sentences. Well wooopdedoo I'll digress my life to you all later on . . . xBuBzx

						   Why you ask, am I going to somewhere nice, without such as much as a physical location? Well mon ami (quite a fitting phrase for this paragraph at least) apart from it's similar audible qualities, which are true to life and to the eyes from what the very metaphorical travel agent "Susan" said, the seaside town in the south of France is where I will be relaxing, sun bathing and writing some predictable angst ridden articles/poetry/scorn which will hopefully re-juvinate me to my full senses, and a browner shade of skin.    BuBz Diet Update   Going fairly well. It's travelling at a much slower pace than last time but, I feel far more comfortable, and in less need to whitness its effect, so this will definetely be managable for the next few months at least. Next update in the coming days, where I will speed things up, a tad, even for this slowish flab burn( Sexual thoughts are obviously screaming there way through you at this minute I'm sure).  God I miss the old people strangely. I miss the fight of fearing for my mental stability at 8:15am every time I paraded into B2 to *cough - queer* chants, which repetitised (yes word of the day) as the 45 minutes approaching Crosby's large backside waddled itself in between the swingdoor ledged, only for the returning door to give it the much needed whack it needed to make the full transition from hall to classroom. It's the first time I can safely say I've missed that place, in that place I had aggression, an attitude, a moral high ground, and a worthwhile war to fight. Yes, I know; it's hard to win the war, (which in the end I didn't coincidentally as the vast majority of you who read this blog are aware) when it's 49/1 against you, but I loved being the  true  outspoken open minded martyr. I could go on, even more than I am at the moment, but it seems I may have repressed some thing after spending the 6 days sleeping without wake I did, which strangely, many of you like to call a coma, where it SHOULD have been called a mental holiday, to erm, MENTAL FLORIDA! I wish I would have stumbled across the world of blog in say, year 10, not only to have got an A in English the following year, but just for some help, I used to be able to handle a great deal of stress and trauma on my plate with easiness as its middle name, but since year 11, I swell up at the sight of pressure. In many senses what happened there won't ever be repaired completely, but like I stated yesterday, I'm ready to find inner peace, and a fit man to boot, (if I can).   I'm not a strong person. The chance of me being one died last January. So if strength is something I'll never posses in adundance, then maybe dignity, pride, an adequate esteem and a lovely companion for eternity would possibly fill the void? Well something has to or I'll never get anywhere in life.   I don't expect anyone to ever comment on these things, or even read there way through all of it, this "thing" is a self-help system, but just writing about it helps, little by little. There's not much more to say on things in school which I'd like people to have open access to, even my old or newish friends, So I'll just leave you beautiful people pondering what it is,  or  gossiping on what an "attention seeking gossiping queen" I am. Whilst you do that, I shall earn money from Tesco. Ciao  xBuBzx

						   Well with Jen finding her inner peace, I'm ready to find mine.   Although mine is a whole other kettle/ocean of fish in it's own right. God at least that girl can get her a stable guy, and quite rightly, she's an amazing girl in all aspects.   Last week went rather well, I got in some overtime and saw a good gig in view to the left, who are by far the best local band I've witnessed, one which the gig whore will have to accompany me to next time; and had an enlightening chatter with a skinhead about "the streets", and no, I don't mean Mike Skinner.   Well this weeks going well, me and Father calmed down after our heated phone conversation, and we most probably will be setting of on the 31st somewhere sunny FINALLY!   The other thing I've been really thinking of in  till time  is what would happen If I got a terminal illness, and I reckon I'd be ok with it, well more than others would be, and that is saying a lot about others appreciation for a wanker such as myself. Personally I'd choose the cancer option because it always has that lovely  right to withdraw if you early enough  clause in it. My whole family seems to have been stricken upon at some point in there life, so it wouldn't be a great shame If I got it anyway. I doubt anyone would kick up a great fuss about me anyway. Well it would piss me of more if people I haven't seen say fro a year from the Kingston/Halliford days started  "mourning"  me, and saying how much I meant to them and visa versa; like  you  would have made the effort to stay in touch if you cared wouldn't you - Anisha et al.  Ian's work interview went swimmingly from what I gathered, and so now he will probably be designing pickey buildings in a place  near you  at a close point in the future. Hoorah, I bet everyone will appreciate the dildo shaped buildings and cock shaped rooves, as it drugingly becomes the archetypical  fashion  for 2004. This all calmed him down from yesterday, where Dan once again showed his true colors with "oh I'm too knackered to take part in football in 5 hours after my devastating 4 hour shift I've just come of" routine. Some people will never change their  slyness . xBuBzx

Take for example Rachael in Minorca or Frances in New York - both god damn free!&nbsp;I've worked my arse of for the chance of some sun for the first time in 3 years, and for what? &nbsp; "Oh Matthew, your Father will pay . . . GOD DAMMIT THIS IS MY HOLIDAY WHICH YOU KNOW I'VE SAVED UP FOR, STOP KISSING MY ARSE YOU IGNARAMOUS!" &nbsp; Well I'm ready to get back in to the writing groove again, but after work mon ami.

						    Goodness, the people at blogger sure do like to test the odd frightful soul for the limits of there sanity - with all the mod cons and expansional net gimmicks flurrying in on greater validity and numericy. Enough with the commenting on the corporate influence -   this   is what they intended amidst their devious ploying:  gossip and more gossip  within there gospel.  &nbsp;  Why however, am I talking to you&nbsp;upon such an early hour, within a vast&nbsp;dry writing season personally speaking. Well, sleeping never really got back to basics, so here I am.  &nbsp;    BuBz Diet Update      Moderate/good since our last dialogue, need to curb the nocturnal munching somewhat, and I reckon that with the array of cuisine shrinking by the day, this diet won't be as hard as I presumed it would have been.    &nbsp;  I think in the last few days, I must have pataken in more high/hippy/with a large transparent townie front drugs session. I've done bong, week, skunk and after a while of doing it, as usual with activities I join in with when I gather a certain confidence in myself, I take a huge liking to it, and so that's why at 3am on Saturday, I could just barely catch a glimmer of coud 9 as it sailed past Jen's living room window. Anyway, I shall reveal more of recent happenings at a more excessive/mentally accesable&nbsp;period. Ciao . . .

						   I won't be blogging for an entire week, which in terms of this site, is a pretty distant period in between.  So I shall try to conjure up something remotely worthwhile to ponder over in the short forthcoming absence we shall encounter.  Hmm, well it appears hard just to create something earth shattering at the first attempt, amidst the first minute - let me think for a while.  I have been thinking of Reading, and more directly, the people associated with going, well the old people. Rarely I think about them, but I wish I saw them more. If your by some freak coincidence reading any of this, and it applies to you in any significant relevance, then I hope you appreciate the sentiment.  Anyway, the kick ass polo shirt I paid homage to yesterday has been BuBzified - meaning it now has embraced sweat alloyed into it, but still, or even more so it's funky and always will be.  As for the entertainment I promised -  urlLink enjoy  xBuBzx

						   Caught back up with the Blues in the lovely town of Pittsburg so let's get started straight away! 25317 on hand for this one with the total looking evenly split once again. No place for Mutu tonight, or Tiago. Couldn't tell if it was Tiago or Carvalho running sprints after the game (think it was Tiago) but clearly they need a bit more fitness.  You've by now seen the lineup, with much the same as the second half of the Celtic game. Kez and GudJ had a go at their chemistry; Cole, Parker, Maka, and Geremi in the middle; Terry and Johnson (again) in central defense with Baba and Ferriera out wide. Once again absent was any presence on the left of midfield, especially going forward. Cole was left to roam and gave Roma quite a time, as he popped up here, there and everywhere. He went forward any chance given, and hassled any white shirt stupid enough to hold on to the ball too long. A tenacious bulldog would be a great description. The first goal was due to his persistence as he battled the ball free, dropped it off to Geremi who returned it through for Joe to score a quick low shot ... 1-0 Chelsea. Geremi's involvement was bound to be there as he was excellent throughout; great switch-field passing, two excellent threaded, weighted passes through to Kez, and the one-two with Cole all showed Geremi what appears to be JM's choice for right midfield. He's played both games on the right and tonight was better than against Celtic. Nothing from the left of midfield however and it seems that when Robben or Duff are not in the side, the play is dominated from the other side of the field. Not one cross, as Cole moved in too many other circles in different areas of the pitch. GJ ran into space on the left a couple of times, but wasn't able to cause any trouble for Roma. He went missing for quite a while also and probably didn't have his best game. Parker and Maka were both solid but not spectacular and both appeared to defend more than attack. Parker linked very well but passed forward much more than press up into anything remotely offensive. I found the two in central midfield an odd mix frankly, and were it not for Cole, it may have remained 0-0.   All the back four were solid. JT was outstanding, Ferriera quite comfortable, and Johnson and Baba played very good as well. Good forward movement from both the right and left. Up front, like I said, GJ was not a factor, but Kezman was every bit the 30+ goals the Dutch league got out of him last season. While the calls for offsides were numerous, I think the total in the first half alone was five, what can you expect against the Italian's defense. They absolutely had no attack and marked our movements fairly well. They had the off-side trap down, that much is for sure. But Kez is very scappy, and very persistent. He does appear to be a bit of a loose cannon also - lots of arm waving at the calls, hasseling around the ball, and moving constantly when off it. He is going to be a handful for any team we face, especially the Arse.   Half-time switches saw Gallas for Johnson and Bridge for Baba to make what more than likely looks like our back four. I see no change in our record shut-outs or goals against. Solid and sure. Not to many set pieces to contend with tonight so the clean sheet should be a boost for sure. JT in particular was fearless and everybit the Captain. Every bit!   Cole made room for Robben on the left, Lamps and Smertin took over duties in the center, and Geremi remained on the right. I can see this also as our starting midfield, especially as Duff works into his fitness. Smertin has really impressed and no one should be afraid of him in place of Maka. He is so controlled and his passing is spot on. Maka tends to run a lot, assasin style, winning balls and breaking up moves forward by the opposition - basically what a good DM should do. Smertin does the same, but then in a flash has linked up with the front for a quick move forward. I didn't rate him last season, but he is on so far. Lamps again went missing for spells, threw a few errant passes out, and all and all did not make his presence known like we know he can.   Up front for the second half was what I believe many have been waiting to see - the partnership of Kezman and Drogba and I for one was impressed with what I saw. They played off each other very very well. While both had great movement and were looking to always score from a midfield assist, they also worked off each other well. There movement is what I enjoyed the best and will just give fits to so many teams. Robben's run down the left produced the second goal as he pulled it back at the last possible moment - Kezman was there to crash it home. The third was from Lamp's hard low shot which couldn't be handled by Roma's keeper, bounced out about a step or so only to have Drogba come crashing in to poke home. Very quick onto the ball he was - a true poacher at work!!   But before that we had the sending off of Kezman. To be fair, he was trying to standup for a teammate, which I like. However, he could have let the ref do his thing and Dacourt would have walked and Chelsea could have gone on to score 5 or 6 goals. Also to be fair, I think Kezman was rushing Dacourt to simply get in his face but as he charged him, Dacourt responded defensively with a punch, Kezman got locked up with him, and the rest is history. Both were ejected and probably rightly so. I hope the red card doesn't effect any Premiership games. Robben limped off a few minutes after and Duff came on. Again, many balls down the left, as they were with Robben. Duff also had a number of cheeky little moves and deft touches. He had a sweet one touch-back heel to Lampard and looked everybit ready for the season to start. He only played 20 minutes but it was fun to watch. Again, Robben or Duff is the hardest question to answer for me.   All and all Chelsea were pure class and out played Roma from the start. I think they had maybe two shots on goal, created very little chances throughout, and never threatened. Totti was the only bright light for them, and then only barely. He went off after 60 minutes with nothing to show for an average night's work. There was something like 8 yelllow cards, compared to just 1 against Celtic, with some nasty tackles from both sides, Dacourt's being the absolute worse. The second half 11 could be the one and I for one could live with it. Believe Cudicini is going the full 90 minutes against Milan. I think it's his spot to lose but Cech sure is not making it very easy for him. This could be the season lads!   MoM - Geremi/Cole first half - Drogba for the second. SongoM - Uh, crickets chirping maybe? No atmosphere sadly to say and the whole game could do with some singing.  WhineroM - Totti for sure. If he spent as much time running as he did complaining and putting his hair behind his ears, he might impress. Never a real factor but hey, HE thinks the ponytail looks good!  Wild man from the hills oM - THE KRAZED KEZMAN! I thought he was gonna pull a Cantona flying drop kick on Dacourt for a second there. No kidding.  FansoM - My two mates who joined me for their first ever soccer match!!! I explained a few things along the way but I think CFC has two more converts. My missionary work is done for the day. xBuBzx

						   Yes, this time tomorrow, I shall be packing for the lovely resort of Nice in southern France.   Can't wait - enough said.   I've just purchased this phonomenal polo shirt for £5 from the  Officers Club  in Walton, which I'm deeply proud of, and another coup in the transfer market (even though everything from the  Officers Club  is basically a coup considering there is a 70% sale virtually 365 days a year) for my ever improving fashion taste (mwah I sound so obnoxious there don't I).   So my preminition/plan for the next couple of days is:   Preparing my clothes and . . .   A&nbsp;new CD for the trip to keep me occupied.    Andrew, Claire and Harry are on there way to Spain anyway tomorrow (damn them they got there before me and Father). I&nbsp;viewed the temperature for Nice and Spain andvarious other&nbsp;destinations&nbsp;for the forthcoming&nbsp;5 days, and it's around 40 degrees&nbsp;God damnit; the first " heatwave " of the summer for Europe is approaching anyway, and August has never really been a great time of year to go on holiday anywhere in Europe -&nbsp;far too hot, as on my return I suspect&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;be a&nbsp;re-invigorated, gangsteresque BLACK MAN; If it gets any hotter at least.   Anyway, I was looking at the brochure for New York, and my&nbsp;goodness there's so many things I want to do in such little time when I'm there, like go to the WWE cafe,&nbsp; Times Square  and  Central Park  and if I play my cards right,&nbsp;the  sex and the city tour  lol, to name just a few.   I've downloaded all these great songs for a new CD, primarily&nbsp;for the plane trip&nbsp;and the daily 9 hour&nbsp;beach session. My personal favorite in the previous 5 minutes having been  Chocolate  by  Snow Patrol  and  Scooby Snacks  by the&nbsp; Fun Loving Criminals . It's looking very indie,&nbsp;however very good; the most convincing, mature, and consistent record/album I've copied to date, and I've copied around 18 in my shot&nbsp;year and a half&nbsp;of illegal download. Half of which I've lost here&nbsp;and there.   Thing are on the up as far as&nbsp;I can&nbsp;reckoned with. All it would take would be to discover some lovely young&nbsp;study in southern France and fuck about with him. Well maybe that's pushing it, but yes, indeed, things are swell and swelling and smelling of VICTORY!!!  xBuBzx

						     Gay Erotic Story - The Pastors Son    I knew I was gay when I was seven years old. That was five years ago. I had experimented with this boy that lived in my apartment complex back then and liked it. Word got around and I became the neighborhood whore, sucking every boy in town and satisfying everyone's dark desires.      So, anyhow, I'm twelve years old, and have had more sex in my life than most thirty year olds. Not that I'm complaining, of course. I just want you to understand me a little bit, a little prelude to the story about me and the pastor's son.      Okay. That's enough. Anyways, me, my dad, and my sister all moved into this new neighborhood and set out finding a new church. We stumbled upon this little tiny church that's services were held in the banquet hall of the pastor's Italian restaurant. It wasn't very big, and there wasn't a big congregation.      But it had David.      David was Pastor Tommy's son. He was the third of four boys born to Tommy and Kelly DeMario, and he was a year younger than I was. He had dirty blonde hair and brown hair. He had a smooth look to him that kept my dick hard all during church service. And the fact that he was supposed to be so holy drove me wild! I couldn't wait to get an opportunity to screw with him, if I could.      So, me and David became good friends and called each other on the phone in between the Sunday and Wednesday church services. Nothing much was said about sex, because he didn't know too much about it, unlike me, but I didn't want to come right out and flirt. That would scare him off.      But, the first sleepover we had changed everything.      He came over with his overnight bag on Saturday. He was scheduled to spend the day with us, sleep over, and then go to church with us the following day, when we'd give him back to his parents.      David and I were too young to go out by ourselves, to my dad took all of us to a movie. Earlier in the week, I had discovered my dad's secret porn stash that had about three movies in it. I already had a VCR in my bedroom because I liked to watch old wrestling videos and my dad hated it, so let me have my own VCR.      So, when we were walking around the mall that the movie theatre was in, my dad and my sister walked ahead while me and David hung back and had our own conversation about wrestling. When I was certain we were out of earshot, I turned to my friend.      "I found my dad's porn videos. Wanna watch them tonight?"      "Uh, okay," he replied. "We won't get caught, will we?"      "No. When my dad's asleep, there's no waking him up. And Gloria is about the same. Plus she don't come into my room anyhow. So we're safe." So we agreed to stay up all night watching pornos.      It was about midnight when everyone in the house was asleep. When we were certain that everyone else was in la la land, David and I snuck out of my room and into the kitchen. Very quietly I got a chair and climbed up to the top of the cabinets above the stove. I grabbed the plastic bag of porn very slowly so the bag didn't rustle and wake my dad up, because he slept in the living room of our two bedroom apartment. When I had the bag and was safely on the ground, we put the chair bag and silently ran back to my bedroom and closed and locked the door.      I turned on the light long enough to see the titles of the movies. We decided to watch the longer one first. So, we sat back and watched the hour long film. It had different scenes of men and women fucking, and one scene of lesbians. I only got hard because I knew that David was horny, and plus I liked looking at the dicks going in and out of the pussies and mouths.      When that movie was finished, I glanced at David's crotch and sure enough, there was a bulge there. I didn't want to make a move just yet, I wanted him to be really horny before I tried anything. The second film we watched was about twenty minutes and was all Chinese lesbians masturbating themselves and fucking their pussies with dildos.      That movie finished and I asked David if he was hard. "Yeah. Very."      "Want to jack off?"      "What's that?" he asked me.      I couldn't believe that at eleven years old he didn't know how to masturbate, but then I realized the he was the pastor's son and shit. "It's a thing you do with your dick to make it feel really good," I told him. "You take it in your hand and move your hand up and down really fast. Wanna try?"      "I don't want you to see my dick, though. That's gay."      "It's okay, David," I assured the innocent boy. "Boys jack off in front of boys all the time."      He reluctantly agreed to do it. So, I pulled down the shorts I wore to bed and took my pulsating penis out of my briefs. He did the same. He kept his eyes glued to me as I started to jack. Then he took his own dick in his hands an mimicked me.      We just laid there and jerked off, watching each other. He suddenly stopped doing it and sighed. I thought he had a dry orgasm, but I didn't see him shake or anything.      "What happened, David?"      "I'm too tired to jack off anymore, Billy."      "I'll do it for you."      I reached over and took his hard cock in my hand. He reached down and slapped my hand off of it.      "Don't touch my dick!"      "It's okay, David," I said. "Nothing wrong with jacking another boy off. I do it all the time. It feels good when another person does it instead of you. Here, jack me off and I'll jack you. Trust me, you'll like it."      So, he reached over with his right hand and clumsily started to jack me. I used my left hand to jerk his big dick. He started to get into it and so did I. Every second it felt better and better. What made it feel the best was knowing that such a hot boy was doing this to me. I never have been with a boy as attractive as David DeMario before, and haven't since. He was gorgeous, and my hand was wrapped around his circumcised holy meat!      Again, the pastor's son stopped. He announced that it was boring. So, not wanting to offend him, I stopped and we trailed off into silence. I lay there, counting the minutes, wondering when would be a good time to go further. After five minutes, I decided it was as good a time as any.      "What do you think dicks taste like, David?"      "I don't know."      "Have you ever tried to lick your own or suck it or something?" I asked him.      "Yeah, once or twice. I couldn't reach it."      "Well, you can lick or suck or do whatever to mine as long as I can do it to you."      "Would that be gay?" he asked me. "Isn't a sin to do this?"      "No, and no. We're just having fun. God likes fun, right?"      "I guess so," he answered.      "Can I taste yours first, please?"      "I guess," he said.      So, I got down on the floor and kneeled on it. My face was hanging over the bed, right near David's crotch. His dick was soft, but mine was rock hard. I darted my tongue out and licked David's head. I felt the boy shudder. I ran my tongue all around his delicious cock head and started to flick it. I felt and saw his dick stiffen. I licked down the length of his semi-hard boy meat and was now at his smooth balls. I took one in my mouth and started to suck on it. I could feel his dick against my cheek, very warm because of all the blood that rushed to his cock.      I rubbed my cheek against this part of his anatomy while I rubbed his balls. I reached my face over and my mouth accepted David's large (well, large to me back then) cock. I took it into my mouth, deep throating that bad boy and sucking for all I was worth. I was sucking so hard that my ears actually popped from the suction. I was having a ball sucking that sexy as fuck boy off.      He had to kill the mood by talking. "You've done this before, haven't you, Billy?"      I made a sound that passed for a yes.      "I can tell. So, you are gay, then?"      Again, I made the noise. I would not take my lips off of this dick. He'd have to kill me first!      "That's okay. I like this a lot, and I really want to know what dick tastes like now. Any way you can keep sucking my dick while I sucked yours?"      So, I showed him the ol' 69 position. We were both laying on my king size bed, my dick in his mouth, his dick in mine. I was sucking him like I'd never suck a cock again. He was sucking me almost like he was afraid to be doing it.      I took his dick out of my mouth long enough just to ask a quick question. "You like how dick tastes?"      "I like how your dick tastes, Billy," he answered me. "I never sucked another dick, so I can't judge them all. But I do like yours, and it does feel so good. But, it feels like I'm about to pee."      I knew he was close, that suddenly that made me close. Now, I just started to make cum. I had been making it for about a month or so. So, after a minute or two of intense cock sucking, I suddenly filled David's mouth with cum. He didn't know what to do at first, but had no choice but to swallow. But, it put him over the edge, because I felt him have his first dry orgasm. He was shaking so hard, and he looked so confused, yet pleased.      When our orgasms slowed down and my cum was devoured, David looked at me.      "Was that white stuff sperm?"      "Cum, David," I told him. "Same stuff, but everyone calls it cum. Good, wasn't it?"      "Yeah. Kinda sweet, but kinda not. Hot and thick. Just good."      "Now, don't tell Pastor Tommy about this. You don't want a whooping do you?"      "No," he said. "But I do want to sleep over again sometime. I liked this a lot."      "So did I, David. So did I." xBuBzx

						   I have just finished watching an enthralling film with the ever so Russian looking Johnny Depp looking GORGEOUS in  The Ninth Gate .  Anyway the day has been quite alright as days go, and as far as days go in the last couple of weeks, its weather refuses to deteorate.  According to Mother and Father, I can being a friend along at new years to  NEW YORK  damnit! I should love to bring Anna or IAN! Yes Ian and myself kicking the yanks arse would be a site to behold.  Anyway that's it as far as today went.  Tomorrow I'm of to the movies with Megan and to get this top I've wanted for ages (God if I don't sound gay there, then I never will *sigh*) - should be fun. xBuBzx

						   Yes, no epic yet I'm afraid (I swear, I'm never traditionally so failatic) as it's only half past one in the morning; however this is just a mere tiny update on GoThIcA LiFe amidst its never ending empirically fallicle eternity.  Last week, before  The German  went of to Alicante for a fortnight, we became closer than ever. We were in the student room of her house (which strangely after so many stayovers, was a room that completely evaded my attention) and be-fittingly for this new room; well we found a new experience to our friendship so to say. After the fondling, kissing, hugging and outright naughtiness, and I was too scared/dubious to try anymore, and I knew I didn't trust myself around her for the foreseeable evening, and so I insisted I disappeared.    That  however wasn't before I learnt I might be meeting the worlds cuuuutest guy - yes that's right - CHARLIE HUNAMM!!! Yes Barbara is fixing a new series with 2 of the cast including blondie and I may be able to come along for the "ride".  After this, Jen put the iceing on the weekly cake, with the fact that I will not be seeing Anna until the  13th Slimelight Townie vs Goth  edition, easily more bareable with the news that she had made contact with Skittles AT LAST, and tonight she had a KICK ARSE haircut - lovely to behold.  Anyway in the last few days I've been to the peel twice and the cinema several times. All films - Spiderman 2, Around The World In 80 Days, and well with the exception of the kids orientated  Thunderbirds , were all fabulous, and the two gigs involving my evil twin, or evil twin, or whatever they are both pronnounced, were wonderful. This even though I hardly saw either of them, as Dan, Ali and tonight Baldwin convinced me that the strip bar behind the peel was far greater value for the evening.  Well naked women must have some appeal, but I haven't really seen it a great deal recently, oh Jesus that probably makes me queer doesn't it. Fuck it's not like anyone who ever reads this blog ever gives a shit and bothers to ever bring this or any subject up with me to help me with my criminalistic issues, so fuck it; I couldn't care less.   Lastly - Ian needs emotional support in the coming weeks/months after some truly traumatic turn of events in his life, and I refuse him a day without checking up o E-Man's mental stability, even in Nice I'll try to manage the feat somehow. It would be rather inappropriate to spill the beans on this blog about the recent happenings with Ian, I mean if he wants to tell you what's happened, then get in contact and friendship with the great man himself, but if you ever read this Ian, then you know I'm here for you whatever. xBuBzx
