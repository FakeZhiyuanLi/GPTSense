       ........why I started watching Big Brother again. It is already sucking away the last couple of days of my holiday.  It's going to be good this year though the contestants are all opposites. I don't really see who is going to get on with who... there is the campest gay man in the world who doesn't like immigrants; the immigrant who doesn't like gay guys; the gay who only beds straight guys; the transexual; the wannabe glamour model; erm the militant lesbian... I think that is enough to keep me watching............. help, I have no life!

       I've just taken Sky's  urlLink How Gay Are You?  test, and surprised myself by being "Under Gay".  Apparently I would disgust women less if I were more gay.  I thought I'd at least be a bit gay, but no.  I bet a certain Take That collector is more gay than me...

       Speaking of public service transport, what is it the invisible force that surrounds taxi / bus drivers which enables them to flout every traffic regulation and ignore the damned decent manners and customs involved in driving? And buses smell. And they emphasise every slight crack in the road. And people sit next to you and talk about the terrible price of fish.

       Has anyone else noticed that Taxi Drivers are turning into Cybermen!!! No?......Well I have and my reasons for this are three fold:  1, They have all started to have small mechanical modifications added to their ears....They claim that they are mobile phone hands free kits but they look more sinister than that!! 2, They act as if this puny world of ours belongs to them. 3, They go about their business with absolutely no regard for human life  All I'm saying is a bag of gold dust in your coat pocket, just in case, may not be a bad idea

        urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Arts features | A charmless, judgmental, hand-wringing harridan : "You Are What You Eat (Tue, 8.30pm, C4), a new 'dietary makeover' show in which a nutrition expert rifles through the shopping basket of a self-confessed blobbo, then tuts and frowns and whines in their face for half an hour. This week's victim is Michelle, a bloated office-bound manatee who spends most evenings shovelling cake into her face in a desperate bid to make life fun again. Her constant diet of crisps, biscuits and microwaveable hermit slop has turned her into a flatulent human waterbed, but fortunately healthy-eating guru Dr Gillian McKeith is on hand to help her mend her ways with a crash diet of organic brown rice, lentils, steamed carrots, tofu, twigs, bracken, soil, and mulch."  I just watched this.  It really was scary what the woman was eating.  Her weekly diet review had no vegetable or fruit, just microwave meals, fizzy pop, crisps and cake.  And, gosh, she was fat.  What a shocker!  How stupid are some people?  "I eat shite, sit on my lardy arse all day and I'm fat!  I need a 'celebrity' nutritionist to tell me what I should be eating."

       Hmmm, I've just realised after having made such a fuss, (well not really so much of a 'fuss' as a muttering.) about having been slighted so from being not initially included as part of this Blogs dynamic quartet...or quintet as it is now, I've not actually posted anything of any real significance...but then having read everyone elses posts here, not saying anything in the first place is perhaps a course of action which might be best suited by some. ;op I do wonder actually how people have the energy to maintain multiple Blogs, and how you distinguish between what is relevant for one and not another, and why you should think you're not only interesting enough but also that your personality is so polarised as to allow for that degree of separation of thought. My 'Passions' site is basically where my brain goes to vomit and let chunks lay where they fall I say...actually this post is starting to be worthy of inclusion in the category of mental hurling. In so much as I have no more clue as to the ultimate destination of this post as I did when I started, other than to say that I thought it best to show my face so to speak. Which is exactly what I shall be doing at my northern homestead this weekend. Ooh that almost looks like a complete circle of consciousness, so perhaps I should end it there before this post exceeds the combined word count for the total of everyone elses contributions...that would be rude of me. Ta-ta!

       Last night Ann had me in absolute hysterics by becoming the first person since 1991 to use the word Duds in the following sense:  Duds - pl.n. A lower undergarment, typically having short or no legs, worn next to the skin under other clothing see Underpants  This made me think that there must be loads of words that have fallen into disuse and so we splendid few should take the responsibility upon ourselves to rescue them....so come on then lets have some more lost words reused on this blog.  I'll start the ball rolling with the following:  Ding - n. A foolish or stupid person....as used in the sentence "You are a proper ding!"  Right your go.....

       Here we go on another rollercoaster of a tournament....and you thought the last one was hard to decide who to vote for!! This one is going to be hell!!!  The groups and fixtures are now on  urlLink Drooster-World   Todays matches are the first in Group A:  CROWDED HOUSE v TRAVIS BON JOVI v GUNS N ROSES  Voting is the same as last time with the exception that you now need to supply more justification for your decision....to quote a GCSE Maths paper, I want you to show your working out!! Even if it is just a certain song or album that swings it one way or the other, or if you have a strong sentimental attachment to a particular band, then let us all know.  The results and next matches will be posted sometime tomorrow (not sure what time cos I'm off all day....hurrah!!)

       OK people, Joll is getting a bit testy!!  I for one don't want to have to try and calm him down so I am issuing a deadline.  All votes for the preliminary round of Droo-rovision 2004 must be in by 8pm tonight.  After that I will count up the votes and put the fixtures and groups onto Drooster-World ready for the first matches in group A to begin tomorrow.  Thank you please

       Well after all the heartache and brain-frying, the result of the first semi-final is:  BOURBON 5-2 CHOCOLATE DIGESTIVE  So the Bourbon takes the first place in&nbsp;Saturday's final, the chocolate digestive has to make do with being the favourite to win Fridays third place play-off.  Todays semi is:  FIG ROLL v JAMMY DODGER.  Going off previous rounds and comments from certain people (Mr Jollie!!) there is a clear favourite but there are no certainties in Droo-ro 2004.  Result at about 5pm tomorrow

       The next two teams through to the quarter finals (from Group B) are Fig Roll and Rich Tea, with Rich Tea just sneaking through with a better goal difference.  The results were:  Group B:  Rich Tea 2-5 Fig Roll Garibaldi 5-2 Wagon Wheel  Who'd have thought the Wagon Wheel would be bottom of that group at the end!! I'm sure Mike will oblige in posting the final table in due course.  Todays matches are:  Group C:  Ginger Nut v Penguin Custard Cream v Chocolate Digestive  The results could effect the final table thus (cool word):  Chocolate Digestive is already through and just needs a point to be group winner All the others could still go through...it's that exciting!!!  I'll post the results shortly after 11am again tommorrow

       As we are now rapidly approaching the knockout stages of Droo-ro 2004 I thought we should sort out what will happen in the event of a draw.  I had thought we could have a golden vote, where the first person to vote after the draw was posted would be the decider...however it has been pointed out that this would favour those people who are online a bit too much...mentioning no names!!  I think a fair way to sort it would be to go back and use the first three votes for a tied match again to decide the result. This would allow more people to have a say in the result.  To ensure I am not accused of cheating, during the knockout matches that this could apply in I would delay my vote until at least 3 votes have been cast so I have no say in deciding the result of a tied match.  Does this seem fair to everyone?  The first match this may apply to is on Saturday 17th July so if you have any opinions on the matter let me know by then, otherwise I will go ahead with this rule..By the way, feel free to say you don't think this is a good system, but I will expect you to supply a better solution.

       So now we know the first quarter finalists!!  Yesterdays results were:  Group A:  Hobnob 1-5 Bourbon Shortbread 3-3 Malted Milk  So both Bourbon and Hobnob go through.  To see the final group table go to  urlLink Drooster-World .  As for today, these are the final fixtures for group B:  Group B:  Rich Tea v Fig Roll Garibaldi v Wagon Wheel  The way the results will effect the table is the same a yesterday:  Fig Roll - Just needs a draw to go through as group winner Garibaldi - Already out but can effect the final table Wagon Wheel and Rich Tea - Which ever team gets the better result will go through. Both can feasibly go through but they would need a massive win to overhaul the Fig Rolls goal difference. Rich Tea has a slight advantage as it has a better goal difference, however it is playing the group leader and Wagon Wheel is playing the bottom team.  Deadline for votes is tommorrow at about 11am again.

       Yesterdays results:  Group D:  Lemon Puff 3-4 Abbey Crunch Digestive 0-7 Jammy Dodger  OK now it starts to get serious....The last set of fixtures for Group A.  Just to help you when you vote, here are a few bits of info about how the results will effect the table:  Hobnob - Just needs a draw to go through as group winner Malted Milk - Already out but can effect the final table Bourbon and Shortbread - Now this is where the drama in this group will be played out.  Which ever team gets the better result will go through.  Both can feasibly go through but they would need a massive win to overhaul the Hobnobs goal difference.  OK so now you know all that, here are the matches:  Group A:  Hobnob v Bourbon Shortbread v Malted Milk  The deadline will be about 11am tomorrow.

       I forgot to mention on the fixtures yesterday that as I am working on late shifts this week, the posting of results and new fixtures will move to the morning...as a result, I need todays votes by  12 noon . The deadline for the rest of the week will be between 11 and 12 in the morning.  Also Mike asked about voting when on holiday...I think that, as the fixture list for the whole of the group stage is on  urlLink Drooster-World  it would be acceptable to email me with all your votes for the period you will be away.  If anyone strongly disagrees let me know.

So my votes are Abbey crunch and Jammy Dodger. Spanks.  -- Posted by Ann to Blog O' The North at 7/9/2004 07:55:42 AM   From James:   From the Scott-house here in Darlington these are the results from the Scott-Peoples.. 2 points goes to Lemmon Puff, 1 point to Jammy Dodger and in the second round 3 points to Abbey Crunch. Thank you and have a great evening, good luck to all the biscuits!  Voting results from 3 people in this one!  -- Posted by James to Blog O' The North at 7/9/2004 09:07:55 AM   From Chris:   I'd have to say Lemon Puff and I don't know what an Abby Crunch is but I doubt it can beat a Digestive with a nice cuppa.  So to clarify Digestive and Lemon Puff from the Sheffield Jury.  -- Posted by Chris to Blog O' The North at 7/9/2004 09:11:45 AM   I'm going to do some research into the comments problems.  Not sure about James voting for three people; if Ann's mam and dad don't think Droo-ro 2004 is important enough for them to vote themselves, I'm not sure their votes should count.  :)

       Thanks to everyone who voted yesterday...unfortunately, probably due to my accidental double post or just a Blogger error, it looks like three votes may have gone missing.  I can only apologise and hope, rather than promise, that it won't happen again.  The results for the first set of matches in Group A were:  HOBNOB 1-2 SHORTBREAD BOURBON 2-1 MALTED MILK  Todays matches are the first set for Group B so we need your votes on the following:  RICH TEA v WAGON WHEEL FIG ROLL v GARIBALDI  Results and next fixtures at about the same time tomorrow (fingers crossed!!)

       ... that there must somewhere be a designer that is paid good money to design clothes for toots (aka charvers). For example today I was shopping and spotted a little pink vest top. Printed on the front was a chihuahua, and underneath it was printed   Pedigree Puppy Hug me Kiss me Love me  That's shit... I'm right aren't I?! Someone has obviously been paid to design it, and this is just one example... there are many other bad clothes that people are being paid to design. Are they given that as the design brief....'design a toot clothing line, the cheapest shit fabric you can get, and the tackier the better really'?  It must have taken some serious time to come up with that pedigree puppy stuff... it would have looked better without it. God damn, that irritates me. Design good clothes, it surely must take about the same length of time.  AND how much does it cost to either make tops in fabric that doesn't shrink in the first wash.. not that much.   And breathe.

       OK here it is...  On Sunday Euro 2004 is over...Tim is out of Wimbledon...the Olympics is ok but I can't get excited about it...as for the tour de france, no thanks....the new premiership season is still 45 days away...I need to fill the hole!!  The solution is Droo-ro 2004, the biscuit championship!!  The set up is identical to Euro 2004 but the 16 football teams have been replaced by biscuits.  At this point, to prevent any controversy, I'd like to say that all the participants have been verified by  urlLink "Nice Cup Of Tea And A Sit Down"  as actually being biscuits. It is for this reason that Penguins and Wagon Wheels are in but the Jaffa Cake is out...I'm sorry but that's the way the cookie crumbles (Pun intended).  OK so the group stages are as follow:  Group A - HOBNOB, SHORTBREAD, BOURBON, MALTED MILK Group B - RICH TEA, WAGON WHEEL, FIG ROLL, GARIBALDI Group C - GINGER NUT, CHOCOLATE DIGESTIVE, PENGUIN, CUSTARD CREAM Group D - LEMON PUFF, JAMMY DODGER, DIGESTIVE, ABBEY CRUNCH  These groups were drawn at random using a random number generator from www.random.org and were overseen by an independent andrewdicator.  So now what I need from you....Each day I will "post" a match on our beloved blog....all you have to do is log on each day and leave a comment on each post to vote for your preferred winner...I will total up the votes and announce the winner the next day with the next fixture...so, for example, the first fixture of the tournament will be Hobnob v Shortbread on Monday 5th of July so you need to leave a comment picking your favourite of these two.  Each biscuit will play the other 3 in their group. Points will be awarded as at Euro 2004...3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw...and these points will decided the final league placings.  The top two from each group will go through to the quarter finals.  OK?  Please feel free to post any questions....don't forget, it all kicks off on Monday!!

       I'm sorry for the delay!! I will have the next Druro-vision 2004 match with you shortly. Unfortunatley I am still at work.... I have been here since 8... I should be paid more!  Anyway it will give those of you who voted for U2 to reconsider your votes before Andrew, Joll and I come and knock some sense into you!!  I'll hopefully update it by 7.  Just got to read through an email, send it and then I can go home.

       Well only one day in and already some people are finding it hard to handle the strain of picking between all-time favourites.......good!! That was the idea!!  Yesterdays results were:  Group A:  CROWDED HOUSE 3-1 TRAVIS BON JOVI 2-2 GUNS N ROSES  Todays fixtures are:  Group B:  ROLLING STONES v U2 AEROSMITH v REM  I think I know how Joll will vote in the second of those fixtures, but he may suprise us all yet!!  Results and next fixtures tomorrow at about 9am.   UPDATE - Ann is going to put the results and fixtures on tomorrow, to allow more people time to vote, so you have until about 5pm-ish to vote on the matches above.
