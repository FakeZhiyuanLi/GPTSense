      Tuesday evening it was , the After glow Bible study at 8. and guess what ? during the study , I was asked to preach for like 10 mins on John 2. Somehow managed to collect three good topics to talk about. But once I took the rostrum , I bungled terribly. I started preaching from the last verse, backwards. Wonder why i did that.. got some reference from Romans which was totally tangential to what i was talking about ..i guess... atleast thts wht was conveyed to me. :( ..bottom line is  I made a mess out of wht i was supposed to advocate. But im glad that I atleast realised where i was wrong. Dint have a chance to figure out where i was right , as i barely was .;)  After the class,  Victor , abhi and I went to coffee day (CD). Victor, a great man of GOD , whom i have very high regards for. More so because of the way he lives his life by faith in Christ Jesus, our LORD. The enthusiasm , the zeal and the commitment that he has for the LORD is so contagious, u wont believe it. You spend a couple of days with him and thats it. You'll be motivated to end up serving the LORD forever !  Such is our leader at Adonai. Abhi and I had the privelege to spend some time with him for some general pep up talk. I wudnt have ever imagined that Vic. wud be comfartable in CD. Took me by surprise. But thts not the point, Vic and abhi were there basically to find out why i was so confused about my career and my future. I shared with them what I really wanted to do in life. Almost every minute i spent with them was so encouraging. At the end of it I was so motivated and focussed and its time for me to implement whtever they both told me. A couple of days more and I'll know for sure ... but for now, i better back to some RT.

      Well It?s a Sunday and one of the busiest days of the week for me. The day begins with spending time at the church, singing along with the worship team giving thanks, glory and Praise to our LORD. Followed by being motivated by an awesome sermon and heading back home. Later in the evening I had to drop my brother to the airport as he was leaving for his second official Singapore visit. When I reached the Airport, I kinda had a real tough time there. I was looking at soooooooooooo many young people at the International Airport entrance. I surmise that at least half of them are going to study either at the ?states? or elsewhere. Was just wondering when on earth I would be able to go through that entrance as a student. Kinda funny as almost all my friends at my workplace and a few others are pretty convinced that there are two things that can never happen in this lifetime, Raghu pursuing his Masters and Raghu pursuing his Masters. My mom read my expressions then and tried to con  vince me by asking me if even I would be carrying such big suitcases when I go to study. I just gave her an assuring smile, btw.. she dreams big things about me that I myself cant think of. She wants me to study, more than I want to. But only I know how confused I was as I drove back home. But on the other hand I have nothing to lose. I really have no inkling about where I am heading, but I am pretty convinced that my LORD definitely has plans for my life that are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay bigger than even what  my Mom or I myself can comprehend. But on second thoughts again.. will I ?
