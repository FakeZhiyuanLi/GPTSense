      once again i feel like shit.. i liked this really really nice guy but it turned out he had a girlfriend and that he was just pretending to like me......soo now i feel like shit...if i had to ask god a ? it would be "what the hell is wrong with me?" his answer would probably be "everything u horrid girl your a slutt whore bitch who has noo purpose!" or something like that... it seems right now the only people that actually give a damn about me or my feelings or w/e is robbie and amanda..i guess i figurted out who my real friends are too oo goody! so now my friend Josh know's i like his brother and he's the one that told me about his gf and shit and i thank him for telling me....so i could realize i dont have a chance.....that sad part of all this is i still like him alot i would do ne thing just to talk to him i would die for him too like me.....o well.. it'll never happen and i probably should just stop liking him all together its too hard liking an older guy ne ways.. never no what they are doin behind your backs..soo yes today is a very depressing day.. i have to leave for camp tommarow saddened by a stupid boy.....at this point i dont wanna go to camp i wanna stay here and try to fix things maybe try to get him to like me.... which wont happen of coutse but yea....i guess ill have fun at camp and ill try not to think about him...for ne reason....i will miss you all soo much speciallly you! &nbsp; another faggot girl, meg &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; please leave me here to rot.....all i want is to go away from all of this...

      everythings wrong...why am i soo sad why cant i be like me? . What I say is wrong, bad. What I do is wrong nothing i do is right so whats the point in trying any more whats the point in trying to be in  a happy place when i know im not in a happy place? Im in Geneva for christs sake.. 48%of Geneva is snobbs 25%are potheads and the rest are like me:(.....     Letters To God:Boxcar racer  Caught off guard  All worked up The air is as dark and cold as night Let me go I'm not done I swear i'll take just one lifetime  (chorus) And I I won't lie I won't sin maybe i don't wanna go can't you wait? maybe i don't wanna go  I should have asked I could have helped At least a fucking thousand times before Will this offer Get me in? Or does this prove that they gave more  And I I won't lie  I won't sin Maybe I don't wanna go Can't you wait? Maybe I don't wanna go  And I I won't lie I won't sin  Maybe I don't wanna go Can't you wait? Maybe I don't wanna go  And I I won't lie I won't sin  Maybe I don't wanna go Can't you wait? Maybe i don't wanna go...   today i think is all about the sad songs..........so this whole page is gonna be lyrics of asd songs    Sing for Absolution-Muse   Lips are turning blue A kiss that can't renew I only dream of you My beautiful Tiptoe to your room A starlight in the gloom I only dream of you And you never knew  Sing for absolution I will be singing Falling from your grace  There's nowhere left to hide In no one to confide The truth burns deep inside And will never die  Lips are turning blue A kiss that can't renew I only dream of you My beautiful  Sing for absolution I will be singing Falling from your grace  Sing for absolution I will be singing Falling from your grace  I won't remain unrectified And our souls won't be exhumed  no one gets what this song is really about but once ya think about it u understand it all....

Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah no no nooo  Yeah, you will suck the life out of me  Bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  But our time is running out But our time is running out You can't push it underground You can't stop it screaming out  How did it come to this?

Will you sleep tonight will you think of me? Will I shake this off...pretend its all okay? That there's someone out there who feels just like me There is  Those notes you wrote me I've kept them all I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall With every single letter in every single word  There will be a hidden message About a boy that loves a girl  Do you care if I don't know what to say?

       Last  night i was up thinking of all my the hard times this summer soo far.. i remember a whole shit load.... >my cousin is leaving....shes like my BIG sister(shannon). >my brother and his problems. >my family falling apart.. >2 of my Best friends fighting and in the end not being friends for awhile. >my boyfriend and i breaking up but getting back together. >fighting with a GREAT friend of mine over who he was going out w/. >losing 2 friends over an other friend. >fighting w/theo everyday. >almost losing someone forever. >thinking i could be friends with ppl 4ever... >my friends wanna go away for highschool.  thats all i can think of right now....   im such a loser...   Guster-Either way-*Lost and Gone Forever*  You were almost kind, you were almost true Don't let me see that other side of you You have learned in time that you must be cruel I'll have to wait to get the best of you Poison in everything you said Don't you, don't you? Wonder what difference does it make......Either way You were almost kind, you were almost true Why give away that other side of you Happens every time, so it must be true Step on a kid, he'll grow up hating you Poison in everything you said Don't you, don't you Wonder what difference does it make....Either way Were you ever kind, were you always cruel? Who's ever seen that other side of you? Happened every time, so it must be true? Where did you learn it's either him or you? You were almost kind, you were almost true Don't let me see that other side of you You have learned in time that you must be cruel I'll have to wait to get the best of you Poison in everything you said Don't you, don't you? Wonder what difference does it make......Either way(2x)

      If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.  When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.        -Thank you\Led Zeppelin  The day will come when you'll be mine But I'll just wait till that time If I have to wait forever, thats what I'll do Cause I cant live my life, without you           Although you may not love me, although you may not care, if you should ever need me, you know I'll always be there. Your heart may not be broken, Your heart my not be free, but if you ever need someone, you can always count on me  ~~Thinking of u brings a smile to my face dreaming of u makes my heart race talking to u makes me want u even more but being with you is wut i live for!~~   Never give up if u still wanna try Never wipe your tears if u still  wanna cry Never settle for the answer if u still want to know Never say u don't like him if u cant let him go  It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  I'd give my happiness to never see u blue I'd give up eternity to always be with u I'd give up my lyfe so that yours would be new I would give up on everything--everything but u  My friends always told me That you would make me cry My friends always told me That you would always lie My friends always told me That I will find some one new But my friends never told me My heart will always want you.  U have no idea who i am, what i've been threw, or whats goin on in this head of mine...so don't talk about me as u may do..u have no idea about the person i wanna be, the people i admire, or what i'm thinkin next..u think i'm happy, but i'm cryin inside..u think i'm strong, but my heart is weak..u have no idea about who i am n some times i'm not even sure..but, for once, stop analyzing the faults i have n give me a chance for me to just be me  A smile can turn the greyness blue A smile can say i love you too A smile can melt a young girls heart Then how come your smile still tears me apart?  I wish u could see the way I love you The way your in my dreams at night The way I smile when your around The way I sparkle when I hear your sound I wish u could see the way I love u The way your in my every thought The way I long to be yours all the time… I wish I just wish that u could be mine.. :-

       when ever i feel like complete shit these 2 guys are always their for me....lately ive been listening to them ALOT lately...i absolutely love them..they make me feel happy their songs are brilliant...i think the reason i feel like shit is bcuz things arent going soo great at home.....with friends....etc. Well yeah right now im listenin to Bridge over Troubled Water soo i guess ill leave w/a few songs by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel       Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon And Garfunkel  When you're weary Feeling small When tears are near your eyes I will dry them off I'm on your side When times get rough And friends just can't be found Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay thee down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay thee down When you're down and out When you're on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you I'll take your part When darkness comes And pain is all around Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay thee down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay thee down Sail on Silver Girl, Sail on by Your time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way See how they shine If you need a friend I'm sailing right behind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind      America by Simon And Garfunkel  "Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together" "I've got some real estate here in my bag" So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies And we walked off to look for America "Kathy" I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh "Michigan seems like a dream to me now" It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw I've come to look for America Laughing on the bus Playing games with the faces She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy I said "Be careful, his bowtie is really a camera" "Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat" "We smoked the last one an hour ago" So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine And the moon rose over an open field "Kathy, I'm lost" I said, though I knew she was sleeping I'm empty and aching and I don't know why Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike They've all come to look for America All come to look for America All come to look for America       Cecelia by Simon And Garfunkel  Cecilia, You're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Awww... Cecilia, you're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Come on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia Up in my bedroom (makin' love) I got up to wash my face, When I come back to bed Someone's taken my place Cecilia, you're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Come on home Jubilation She loves me again I fall on the floor and I'm laughing Jubilation She loves me again I fall on the floor and I'm laughing wo-oh-ooooh-oh, wo-oh-oh-oh-oh wo-oh-oh-oh-oh,oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...     Bookends by Simon And Garfunkel  Time it was and what a time it was it was A time of innocence a time of confidences. Long ago it must be I have a photograph preserve your memories they're all that's left you.     El Condor Pasa by Simon And Garfunkel  I’d rather be a sparrow than a snail Yes, I would If I could I surely would I’d rather be a hammer than a nail Yes, I would If i only could I surely would Away, I’d rather sail away Like a swan that’s here and gone A man gets tied up to the ground He gives the world Its saddest sound Its saddest sound I’d rather be a forest than a street Yes, I would If I could I surely would I’d rather feel the earth beneath my feet Yes, I would If I only could I surely would     For Emily,Whenever I May Find Her by Simon And Garfunkel  What a dream I had Dressed in Organdy Clothed in crinoline Of smoky burgundy Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets down Past the shop displays I heard cathedral bells Tripping down the alleyways As I walked on And when you ran to me Your cheeks flushed with the night We walked on frosted fields Of juniper and lamplight I held your hand And when I awoke And felt you warm and near I kissed your honey hair With my grateful tears Oh, I love you girl Oh, I love you     Homeward Bound by Simon And Garfunkel  I'm sitting in the railway station. Got a ticket for my destination. On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band. Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Ev'ry day's an endless stream Of cigarettes and magazines. And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping, Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Tonight I'll sing my songs again, I'll play the game and pretend. But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping, Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Silently for me.    I Am A Rock by Simon And Garfunkel  A winter's day In a deep and dark December; I am alone, Gazing from my window to the streets below On (a) freshly fallen silent shroud of snow. I am a rock, I am an island. I've built walls, A fortress deep and mighty, That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain. I am a rock, I am an island. Don't talk of love, But I've heard the words before; It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved I never would have cried. I am a rock, I am an island. I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor, Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock, I am an island. And a rock feels no pain; And an island never cries.     Mrs Robinson by Simon And Garfunkel  And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. (Wo wo wo). God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray (Hey hey hey, hey hey hey). We'd like to know A little bit about you For our files. We'd like to help you learn To help yourself. Look around you. All you see Are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds Until you feel at home. And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. Wo wo wo. God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray Hey hey hey, hey hey hey. Hide it in a hiding place Where no one ever goes. Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes. It's a little secret, Just the Robinsons' affair. Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids. Coo coo ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo wo wo. God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray Hey hey hey, hey hey hey. Sitting on a sofa On a Sunday afternoon, Going to the candidates' debate, Laugh about it, Shout about it, When you've got to choose, Every way you look at it you lose. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Woo woo woo. What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson? "Joltin' Joe has left and gone away" Hey hey hey, hey hey hey.     The Boxer by Simon And Garfunkel  I am just a poor boy. Though my story's seldom told, I have squandered my resistance For a pocket full of mumbles, Such are promises All lies and jest Still, a man hears what he wants to hear And disregards the rest When I left my home And my family, I was no more than a boy In the company of strangers In the quiet of the railway station, Running scared, Laying low, Seeking out the poorer quarters Where the ragged people go, Looking for the places Only they would know Lie-la-lie... Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job, But I get no offers. Just a come-on from the war zone On Seventh Avenue I do declare, There were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there. Lie-la-lie... Then I'm laying out my winter clothes And wishing I was gone, Going home Where the New York City winters Aren't bleeding me, Leading me, Going home In the clearing stands a boxer, And a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders Of ev'ry glove that laid him down Or cut him till he cried out In his anger and shame, "I am leaving, I am leaving." But the fighter still remains Lie-la-lie...       Scarborough Fair-Canticle by Simon And Garfunkel  Are you going to Scarborough Fair... Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme Remember me to one who lives there; She once was a true love of mine. Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (On the side of a hill in the deep forest green) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground) Without no seams nor needlework (Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain) Then she'll be a true love of mine (Sleeps unaware of the clarion call) Tell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Washes the ground with silvery tears) Between the salt water and the sea strand (A soldier cleans and polishes a gun) Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather (War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Generals order their soldiers to kill) And to gather it all in a bunch of heather (And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten) Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme Remember me to one who lives there; She once was a true love of mine.     omg soo many more GREAT songs im just tired.....ill write more later...if i wanna talk about my feelings or w/e
