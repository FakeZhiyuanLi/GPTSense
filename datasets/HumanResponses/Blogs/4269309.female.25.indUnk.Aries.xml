       i've heard that a punky brewster dvd has been   urlLink  released   . talk about modern-day miracles! my roommate and i carpool to work each morning, it's roughly a 20 minute commute, and in the car we recounted all of the episodes. by memory alone! how amazing that show must have been. especially because it taught me how to knife-fight, a skill that i thought i knew from watching a westside story, but learned how wrong i was by watching punky. the details of the episode are hazy, but what goes on is that punky is back in the orphanage - probably because henry, that's right, warnimont is in the hospital with an ulcer - and there's a troubled youth in the orphanage with her. he doesn't want to be there, no sir, and so he pulls a knife. punky is rescued by her mentor-turned-teacher who wraps some sort of cloth around his hand to grab the knife from the youth. who knew? and here i thought that knife-fighting was set to music! punky taught me how to just say no, for sure, but even more punky taught me how to protect myself on the mean cruel streets of life.  that show was amazing, everyone remembers the challenger episode, or the time when she went camping and got lost in that cave (a three parter!). or, when cherie gets locked in the refrigerator and we all had to learn basic first aid. um, or the time when punky became brandon and brandon became punky. the lists goes on and on, i can name them all...

      i've got a fever.  for the olympics.  it's ridiculous, i know, but i can't help myself when it comes to the running of the xxviii (that's 28th) olympiad. the sports showcased are insane and i only give thought to them once every four years. mens synchronized diving? where did this come from? what happened to one guy standing up on a platform of tremendous height and flipping and twirlling until he hits the water at just the perfect angle to create no splash?! i haven't seen this so-called normal diving at all so far. are we too advanced to do things individually? i think so, yes. we're a co-dependent society, hell bent on working cooperatively to make a better world.  i've heard that they're making a sequel to 'baby geniuses' - again, how is this possible? the twisted logic here must have gone something like this: 'baby geniuses. now  there  was a film. babies talking and doing shit; that's what the people like. what about part 2, what happened to these baby geniuses? we're all wondering. maybe there are  new  baby geniuses out there, we'll call it, um,   urlLink super babies   - why we didn't think of this four years ago is beyond me - write up the script, we're going to turn this mother out.' yup, this is america, baby geniuses - i shit you not. now i'd have absolutely no problem if we created a movie called baby olympics. or maybe even baby synchronized men's diving.

       three weeks ago at a bar my roommate and i decided to start a web site of all of the interesting ideas we've had or will have in the future. of course this never happened. but we decided to call it imyselfamstrangeandunusual.com - if you can name where that line is from, i salute you, if you can't, i don't. salute you. that night was a crazy one, for sure. we were at the northstar bar, watching  urlLink eugene mirman  and friends performing what i think is now termed 'indie comedy'. the night was wrecked by a heckler and some hysterically cruel comments from both parties. my roommate and i had been drinking martinis and then stoli-vanil and cokes throughout night because we hadn't gone out together in quite a long time. as such, we started writing up our ideas on dirty napkins that i have saved somewhere for safe-keeping, but can't remember where it is that's so safe.
