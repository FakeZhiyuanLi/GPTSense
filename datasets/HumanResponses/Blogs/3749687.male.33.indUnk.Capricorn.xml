      The Houston's guy called back - wants to meet me tomorrow sometime when he flies in from Miami.  Only thing is that if I go into their training program, I have to move.  I don't really want to move.  Stephanie definately doesn't.  I like Dallas - would prefer to stay here.  If I were single it wouldn't be such a big deal.  This Houston's thing means I'd have to move right away for 6 months for training, then after that maybe move again, and again, and again.  I think I'm going to have to reject their offer if they do offer me a job.  Gay.  Doesn't look like I can go to Ryan's wedding either.  No job, no passport, no green card, no money.  Double gay.  Stephanie & I are going down to the county clerk's office Friday to get our marriage license.  Don't know where & when to ceremony is going to be.  Froehle proposed to Becky today.  I'm assuming she said yes - I didn't actually talk to him.  Just heard all the hoopla in the background as I was defrosting the walk-in freezer like a minimum wage worker.  Yeehah.

      Spent today and yesterday cleaning up the disaster area Earls was in.  After the party Friday night/Saturday morning, it looked like a bomb had gone off.  Some jackpot was trying to break into the place later around 5:30 pm.  Nothing there to steal anymore - idiot.  Cleaning up that place sucks ass.  Crap everywhere, my fingers are all cut up from moving these metal shelving things.... If I wasn't getting paid to do it - I would not be doing it.  Getting lots of free food & wine - but it's white wine.  I don't really drink it and either does Stephanie or her parents.  Told everybody on my side of the family about the wedding and what's going down (unemployed/green card/wedding details).  No big surprise to anyone.  Mom wants to do some wedding thing up in BC, but the workability of that doesn't seem too likely.  Talked to an immigration lawyer.  $1500 to do the legal paperwork.  I could file all the junk myself, but the interview thing sounds a little more tricky, plus I might fill out the forms wrong.  It would be way cheaper though.  Got a loan today for $2G, but the interest rate is retarded.  Damn green card.  Houston's hasn't called back yet.

      Last night was the final Earls night.  Lots of beer and shots.  Blakey made a CD with the "Cheers" theme song as well as some other songs on it.  The lounge there was pretty much like Cheers with all the regulars that drank there.  I gave Bones the "How To Be A Canadian" book.  There was a bunch of crying but I left before the real waterworks started.  Chicks.  I'm still pissed about the whole situation but my head is throbbing right now from the last bit of my hangover.    Now all I have to do is be unemployed.  Actually going to be cleaning up the restaurant next week to make some extra cash while I have no job.  Hopefully I won't be a bum for long.

      Today's the last day that Dallas will have an Earls Restaurant.  I have probably worked for the last time for Earls as well.  Earl can kiss my ass as far as I'm concerned.  Got sat down for having a pissy attitude at work yesterday.  Like I'm gonna be in a good mood.  I came back from a vacation only to find out I won't have a job in 2 weeks.  I wouldn't have gone on any damn vacation blowing money going to baseball games & gas if I knew I wouldn't have a job when I got back.  I bust my ass for almost 5 yrs at a piece of sh!t Earls that looks nothing like what an "Earls" would be like up in Canada.  What do I have to show for it all?  "Earls" - wise? Jack squat.  I did meet the girl I'm going to marry by coming down to Texas, which probably never would have happened if I stayed in Edmonton.  I have a Neon that was stolen by a bunch of punk Mexicans, but is virtually undrivable because of the high speed chase/crash they got into being chased by the cops.  Right now the Neon is a big green pylon in the parking lot near my apartment.  The bank can have it back if they want to come all the way down here from Edmonton to get it - but that's unlikely.  I'm not going to pay for it anymore.  I did save a bunch of money on the insurance I never bothered to get for it down here.  Ironically when it was stolen was the only time I did have insurance on it - just not theft insurance.  My Durango was a pretty good aquistion, but it's overheating right now.  I have to drive with the windows down & the defrost cranked to high heat to avoid conking out on the freeway.  Not a fun thing to do in a Dallas summer.  Tonight is going to be a gong show.  Everybody's going to be drinking & crying and all that crap.  I only have two emotions regarding the restaurant being shut down: pissed & really pissed.

      Tomorrow is the day Stephanie & I go down to the Justice of the Peace and get married.&nbsp; We're going to the one in Irving because it isn't as crowded, isn't in a scummy area of town and looks a lot better from the outside. The grounds surrounding it aren't quite so depressing&nbsp; either.&nbsp; There's a fountain and Irving City Hall is right beside it.&nbsp; All the other ones were total city office bomb shelter looking places where people goto re-new their vehicle registrations and driver's licenses.&nbsp; This one seems the best out of the few to choose from.&nbsp; That way we can take some pictures outside afterwards and not look like they were taken in the 1950's.  Nothing like leaving it until the last possible moment either.&nbsp; The marriage license expires 30 days after you get it if it isn't signed by a judge after the ceremony.&nbsp; Friday is the last possible day for us to do it before the end of the month.&nbsp; Wasn't really procrastination - just waiting on a ring to arrive at the jewlery shop.  Stephanie's out having a semi-bachelorette party tonight.&nbsp; I'm not going to go do that tonight because my friends would get me so plastered that I'd probably be puking all day tomorrow.&nbsp; I'll wait until we go to Vegas for the "ceremony" to have that - then more people that can't be here tomorrow will be able to attend as well.&nbsp; We're doing the Vegas thing because; 1.)&nbsp; Stephanie wants to have the walking down the isle thing in a dress, and the parents want it to be done in a chapel/church.&nbsp; Certain parents are getting all bent out of shape that we aren't getting married in a church to start with.&nbsp; 2.)&nbsp; We just don't have the time or money to set something like that up right now.&nbsp; That's why we're going to have that in Vegas later.&nbsp; 3.)&nbsp; It's also easier for everyone we both know to be able to afford to fly down and attend because Vegas is pretty easy to get to airfare-wise.&nbsp; 4.)&nbsp; Afterwards, instead of blowing a whole wad of cash on a reception, we can all go out to the casinos and probably have more fun that just being stuck in a hall somewhere dancing to a bad DJ playing music from the 80's that maybe 20% of the people there would like, and sitting around at tables with everyone getting boozed up and pigging out..  I was going to go on a tirade about the church thing, but I won't right now....

       I finally got a job - maybe.&nbsp; It's with a company I used to work with in Canada.&nbsp; I have to get around the fact I'm technically not legal to work here in the USA at a place other than Earls just yet.&nbsp; I started the whole "Application for Permanent Residency" legal paper work with my immigration lawyer.&nbsp; He said that while I can probably get away with working right away, the place offering me the job is trying to make sure they won't get in trouble for hiring me earlier than they legally should.&nbsp; Unauthorized work by me is "overlooked" if I am married to a US citizen, but the company doesn't have that same luxury.&nbsp; I just can't falsify any documents saying that I am already a citizen because that will gimp up my application for residency.     &nbsp;   I have to call the Justice of the Peace to set up a date for the marriage ceremony to officially be married, and get the certificate signed and copied to give to the lawyer.&nbsp; Tried to find one that wasn't a complete dump like most of the old ass government offices built in the 50's tend to be.&nbsp; The one out in Irving is where we're going to try an get an appointment.&nbsp; The line up didn't seem too long, and there weren't too many gomers hanging out there.

      Clemens got lit up last night.  I think Piazza was telling the batters the pitch that was going to be thrown. Houston's ballpark is pretty small so that didn't help him for the two homeruns he gave up.  Ali was cool throwing punches like the old days - especially at Jeter, then doing the two finger thing behind A-Rod's head.  Classic.  Too bad I couldn't go to it.  Even though it was only three hours away, the  "no job/no money to blow on stuff like that"  kind of killed that idea.

      Why do these snapperheads keep asking me to phone them back if they don't know if they want to give me a job or not?  I mean if you don't want to hire me quit telling me to phone you back.  Just do the "we'll call you" bit.  There's 4 places doing that to me.  I had to put the Houston's job on hold until after I get the Green Card.  They kept wanting me to call back, and call back, and call back.  I guess they would've hired me if I were already legal, but Froehle has been flown out to two different places by them and he still doesn't know if Houston's has hired him or not yet.  I'm gonna have to go door to door and mow lawns pretty quick.

       urlLink "Freak Hailstorm and Floods Hit Edmonton." - Edmonton Journal     The only reason I wouldn't move back to Edmonton - the weather there is way too goofy.  I hated winter there.  Minus 30/40 C with windchills putting it at -75 C sometimes is bullsh!t.  The summer there is too short, and then you get crap like this happening in the middle of July. Sure am glad I'm down here in Dallas where the weather is approaching 100 F today.  Oh yeah - I still don't have a job.

      Why doesn't anyone decide whether or not to hire you after one, maybe two interviews?  I've been talking to this guy from Houston's for about 2 weeks now, the guy from Pappas Bros., wants me to call him back again next week... is it like this everywhere here?  I've got another interview tomorrow at Palomino, and Truluck's is going to call me as well.  Hopefully it isn't going to take forever to get a job.  Especially when eye exams cost $89.  I have to stop wearing my contact lenses so much.  My eyeballs are drying out and the blood vessels in my eyes are getting bigger in an attempt to get more oxygen.  Sounds worse than it actually is.  Just have really red eyes.  My right eye is the worst.  Went to the eye doctor.  He told me to try out these more oxygen allowing lenses and to get some glasses to wear around the house.  I haven't really worn glasses since grade 11 (or  eleventh grade  for the Yanks)...

      Yesterday I had to inflate the tires on my doorstop of a Neon because it would have been towed away otherwise.  Why don't I just don't let them tow it? I don't know.  I never drive it - the battery is completely dead after sitting there for two years in the same spot.  Taking off the tires and driving down to the gas station with them in the back of my Durango to inflate them seemed kind of stupid - but it gave my unemployed ass something to do.  They put some stupid sticker on the window saying that they'd (Northbridge) tow it away for having uninflated tires.  Some sort or blemish on the community I guess.  There might be another sticker on there today because I didn't inflate all the tires - just the most obvious ones.  They might have even just towed away the Neon because they said I had until the 3rd to fix it or they'd tow it.

      Today Stephanie and I went down to the County Clerk's office and got our marriage certificate.  We have to wait 72 hours before we can get "married".  If we aren't married and have the license signed by the end of the month, the license expires.  We also picked up her ring and picked out the one I'm going to get. She wanted to wear hers, but I wouldn't let her have it.  I finally did the whole official "proposal", and now she's wearing it.  The circumstances of the whole situation are a bit abnormal and not the way such a set of events would usually take place.  We both knew we wanted to get married, but the job loss, work visa/illegal alien thing just hurried things along.  The end result is the same, just the path to get there was abbreviated.  So while everything didn't happen in the usual fashion - the end result is what we both wanted.  We're both happy.  Now I just need a job...

      I'm now a married man.   The ceremony went well.  Wearing a ring now.  That is taking some getting used to.  I never wore a ring before.  The ceremony was in the judges chambers at the JP in Irving.  The guy had some kind of thing for elephants, because there were elephant pictures and statues everywhere.  I didn't know if the actual ceremony was going to be at the front of a courtroom or something.  Then we went and took some pictures afterwards in the courtyard at the Crescent Hotel.  After that we went and had a drink at the new Hotel ZaZa in the Dragonfly Lounge, then dinner at Javier's.  Stephanie cleaned up with gifts from her shower - got lots of stuff.  So all in all it was a very good day.  July 30th-2004.  I just have to finish this INS crap so I can work legally in the USA.  The next thing I need to do is get a doctor's exam.  That is going to cost another $200+ dollars.  This immigration crap isn't cheap.  Going to probably get a whole bunch of shots, because I haven't been to a doctor in about 15 years, and haven't had a shot since highschool.  Our passport photos we had taken for the AOS application make us look like Bonnie & Clyde after getting arrested.  Then all I need is the letter from Earls stating my salary history and the birth certificate copy which got screwed up because I put the wrong maiden name for my mother on the application for a new B/C.  It asked for "mother's maiden name at birth".  I assumed that meant at my birth, but nooooo - it meant at her birth.  So they mailed me a regular mail letter saying that I put the wrong name down.  Why didn't they just email me that?  They had my email address - I applied for the B/C online.  Stupid government B.S.

      Nobody is forcing people to eat at McDonald's/Burger King/Jack in the Box/Taco Bell.  People bitch about being obese and blame it on fast food.  There are no bad foods, just bad food habits. If I’m fat (and anyone who knows me knows that there is no way I'd be mistaken for a fat-ass) it’s not Ronald McDonald’s fault, or ConAgra’s fault or Ben & Jerry’s fault, or my mom’s fault or anyone’s fault but my own. I don’t support lawsuits against fast food any more than I support lawsuits against cigarette companies. Anyone who doesn’t know cigarettes are bad for you is an idiot. Anyone who doesn’t know that eating too much fast food will make you fat…ditto. In fact I think I may organize a class action lawsuit against people who stage lawsuits against corporations who they think should take responsibility for them. Most corporations can barely take responsibility for themselves much less others. If I’m fat it’s because I’ve shoved to many calories down my pie hole. I don’t need to chat with Oprah about it and I sure don’t need to consult that “Dr” Phil. I just need to stop eating so much and exercise more. Duh.  Ronald McDonald doesn’t give a damn about you. Neither does that Wendy or any of the other fast food joints . And you know what, they’re not supposed to. They’re businesses doing what businesses do. They don’t love you. They won’t be with you when you graduate, when your children are born or when you die. You will be with you and your family and friends will be with you. And, if you’re any kind of human being, you will be there for them. We are fat and sick and dying because we have handed a basic, fundamental and intimate function of life over to corporations. We choose to value our nourishment so little that we entrust it to strangers. We hand our lives over to big companies and then drag them to court when the deal goes bad.  Burgers don’t kill people. People kill people.  Even the part about poor people not being able to afford anything else to eat, and there are no grocery stores nearby - that's a crock.  I'm pretty poor right now.  I  could  go down to McDonald's and get 2 cheeseburgers for 99 cents or whatever, but I could also go to the grocery store and get a bag of pasta that would last 2-3 meals for the same 99 cents.  Just because there isn't a grocery store a block away from you doesn't mean you can't walk/drive to it.  Quit being lazy.
