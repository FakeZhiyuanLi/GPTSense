       isn't it strange how we are unwilling to share our innermost feelings and thoughts with our loved ones, but we openly write about them for complete strangers to read?

      i love Bible school.  1. because i love God.  2. because i love children.  i am helping teach as few as 6 and as many as 12 (last night) 4 & 5 year olds about God, Jesus, and the Bible.  i like the younger children much better than older kids; S used to help with the teens and it was more like a room full of crapy attitudes.  it amazes me what these children retain!  we have some of the same ones from last year and they actually remember what we learned last year!   they're not perfect and they all act up.  but generally, they're just great.  especially at 9pm when their parents come to scoop them up.  M email yesterday and wants to go to the beach.  she asked when a good time for us was....i wanted to say when you get over yourself and grow up, but i didn't think that was an appropriate response so i didn't reply.  maybe during this pregnancy, she will grow up and something will click in her brain that she's not #1 anymore.  i certainly hope so.

      my first is of course, my husband, S.  my second, is my kitty, Vada.  she is black on top and white on bottom...white feet, belly, and chin.  she has this white stripe down the backs of her legs which gives the illusion that she's wearing black stockings with white seams.  what makes her adorable is that she's so overweight; she's pushing 25lbs.  her body looks like a big fat pillow with a little bitty pea sized head attached.  she's so fat, her baby-soft pink belly drags the floor when she walks.  and she's just like a woman, she's very self-concious about her weight.  she hides in a corner while she bathes.  but maybe this is the only way she can bathe...she literally props herself up against the wall and uses her front paw to pull her stomach up so she can clean it.  a funny sight. she loves fuzzy mice, feathers, and apples.  she knows that when i walk to the drawer to get the apple slicer that she's getting a treat.  she likes to play under rugs and runs back and forth, scooting underneath each one.  she sleeps in a tyson chicken box...how appropriate.  we shopped at sam's one day and brought the box home.  she hasn't left it yet.   she is terrified of thunder but will lay on the vacuum cleaner.  she loves to nuzzle our ears and have her nose tickled by our eyelashes.  my husband comes up with crazy nicknames for her...my favorites are "velvada cheese" & "livin' la vada loca".  he has the habit of dancing with and singing to her in the morning.  what a priceless picture to have of a 6'5" 250lb man (in his underwear, no less) spinning around with a cream-puff like kitty singing "my girl".  two of the sweetest things in my life.

      what a great day.  early morning workout.  quick dash to my massage.  ramble through my favorite stores.  relax and watch the tail end of "cocktails".  wash my truck.  not a person to answer to.  not anything to do if i don't want to do it.  S is on his way home right now from a golf game with my dad & M.  M called today.  she sounded so lonely.  my heart still breaks for her and M for their loss. (i know a lot of Ms)  J just died recently from cancer.  it ate his body up and he couldn't last any longer.  mama was there the last week.  i can't even think about what it would be like to watch someone die.  let alone my husband of almost 30 yrs.  i know i would make it alone, but i don't think i would want to.  M has lost her dad...her daddy.  his death really has me thinking about what is important in my life.  i see myself day after day...so into what is important to me, not stopping to think about my mom and dad and how they are aging right before my eyes.  my mom has really gotten older in the past year.  i can see it in her eyes, not just her body.  but i think she is enjoying life more now than ever.  didn't go to pottery barn today, C just wasn't feeling up to it.  blah, blah, blah.

      has there ever been anyone else pregnant?  if so, i don't believe you!  C is the only woman to have ever gone through the horrors of pregnancy and eventually, childbirth.  maybe it's a little jealousy, but mostly it's just plain annoyance.  we used to have a friendship where we could talk about anything...now it's all about trimesters, morning sickness, preggie pops, nursery colors, who will be there for the birth, blah, blah, blah.  C is married to M.  M's motto should be "hold on a moment while i raise my wife and child".  i know i'm selfish (which is the main reason why we don't have children yet) but she's beyond the selfish mark.  M was complaining last night that C is just taking advantage of her "state".  i know she is sick and not feeling well, but geez,  everything  has a story about how she was not feeling well, sweaty, has diarrhea, or almost passed out in someone's office. she was telling me she got sick yesterday in her office and was gagging over the garbage can...probably only when someone was walking by!!! so here's some advice from a selfish, childless, know-it-all:  grow up!!!!  it's not going to be all about you in a few months, you better get used to the idea!  i feel sorry for M the most since his life will only consist of washing clothes, dishes, cleaning, and raising a princess and HER child (not his).

      there is a turtle on our office doorstep.  this morning we had a cat.  yesterday, we had 2 deer and a coyote in the back yard.  we are infested with crickets.  what is this, swiss family robinson?  my husband says it's a cooter, not a turtle.  cooter, what a funny word!  who came up with that?

      We'll see how this works.  I don't have a clue what I will write about, my life is not at all interesting.  Happy, but not interesting
