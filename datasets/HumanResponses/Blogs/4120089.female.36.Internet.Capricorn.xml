      I have a friend who is sad. Sad and lonely. She didn't even feel like sewing. So I thought I would try an exercise with her with color -- colored pencils and paper to be exact. I find with this particular friend, she thinks better in images than words.  I had her pick colors and then draw an object. We concluded that with the imagery she drew she was telling of what she was going through. I think it was successful.

      Every day it has been raining. Now, I knew it was going to rain when we moved here. I suppose it is still the residuals from Hurricane Alex. Just the sky is so dark. Makes it for such a brooding day. The rain coming down so hard it looks like a fire hose is on.  A new development! My son lost another tooth today! :) That is always exciting. He said a carrot got it out. LOL. He has all these theories about how things work, how things are, how things come to be. Quite amazing actually. Little mad scientist. Well back to work.

       It's blogging time! That magical time of night when everyone has gone to sleep and I get a moment's peace to unwind and write. I have been keeping journals since I was 15. In my sophmore year in high school I had a teacher named Sophie Raven. Ms. Raven was Czechosolavkian and as an exercise had us keep a journal to record all our feelings, wants, desires, pretty much anything that came to mind to use for the poetry we had to compose in the class. I got published in the high school literary magazine and have continued to be published online and continue my writing to this day. I have over 9 volumes of journals that are hand-written and then I've started this blog. Being able to type in my thoughts and not worry about having to read my writing later has its benefits.  Today, my mood emulated the storms and weather today. Hurricane Alex is off the Carolina's and we're getting these residual storms. The rain comes in fast and furious and then leaves again -- so to my moods, in and out fast. I spent most of the day listening to Sheila Chandra, an Indian artist that fuses trip-hop with melodic tunes and deep lyrics. She is very soothing. If you'd like to read more about Sheila Chandra,  urlLink click here .  As I sit in the dark, writing, my mind wanders again, my heart yearning to be close, to feel, to explore. I am melancholy but blissful with my memories. I feel like I am in a world of limbo -- not sure really where to go next. This move has left me feeling disjointed and lost, the support I had back in California gone, replaced with family, which isn't horrible, but it just isn't the same. The peers that I enjoyed are now three hours behind me and by the time I am ready to go to bed they are just getting started with their evening. This adjustment will take time getting used to.  I feel like the lightening that ebbs and flows in the clouds -- darting about, making light and then vanishing. Over and over again, darting, looking, and then touching ground. Will I find my feet again? Will I find peers that are satisfying and worth hanging around with? I feel comfy on the East coast, more comfy than I have felt in a long time but I am lonely. And all I can think about is the Sun and how it feels on my skin, and driving by Stinson, and traipsing through Muir Woods, and hanging out at Laguna Beach, watching the surfers at Huntington riding the waves...I miss it. I think I just need to go out and explore the beauty that is around me and I will feel better. I wish my friend was here though with me, so that we could explore it together.  Well, as they say, tomorrow is another day.

      This song by Sheila Chandra exemplifies how I am feeling right now for that special someone who is on my mind...   Ever So Lonely, Sheila Chandra    Ever so lonely Ever so lonely without you Ever so lonely   Sink into your eyes and all I see Love is an ocean And you for me   Sink into your eyes your eyes are all I see Your love is an ocean   An ocean refuses no river Ever so lonely An ocean refuses no river Waiting for the time when we can be alone together   Alone together Eternally   The ocean, the ocean  refuses no river   The ocean, your ocean refuses no river   ever so lonely ever so lonely without you   your ocean your ocean refuses no river

       It is like that Beetles song, "Fixing a hole..." says:   I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering where it will go  I'm filling the cracks that ran though the door and kept my mind from wandering where it will go  And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right where I belong I'm right where I belong  See the people standing there who disagree and never win and wonder why they don't get in my door   I'm painting my room in a colorful way, and when my mind is wandering there I will go  And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right where I belong I'm right where I belong  Silly people run around they worry me and never ask me why they don't get past my door   I'm taking my time for a number of things that weren't important yesterday and I still go  I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering where it will go where it will go  I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering where it will go     Seems that no matter how hard I try to concentrate, my mind wanders. It wanders to past experiences that I long for, it wanders to wishful thinking, it wanders to daydreams, it wanders to the special people in my heart. I miss them so much. I guess today I am really missing my friends. Especially some of them who know who they are. It would be nice to be able to see them, and give hugs and see smiles. That was perhaps the hardest part of leaving California, was leaving some of these folks behind and not knowing when I'd see them again, other than email and the occasional phone call.  It is one of those days where you wish they'd invent a teleportation device already so that it would send you instantly to the location of your choice.

       I thought I would give some background of who I am and where I come from. God, where to start...I guess I should start at the beginning -- but it seems so damn boring. I was born in Illinois in one of the worst blizzard's in Chicago's history, January 1968. My mom almost didn't make it to the hospital. I grew up on the North Shore of Chicago until I was 12. Lofts were a big thing in 1979 and my parents decided they wanted to be city pioneers and get one in the South Loop. After a year of building we moved to downtown Chicago. This was actually a great move for me. I was able to be who I wanted without being judged, I had Chicago as my whole backyard and was really ready to explore who I was. I had many experiences that I loved, hated and vowed I would never repeat again.  When I finally turned 18, I didn't want to stay at home anymore, I simply couldn't deal with my parents and some of the other crap I was going through. So I moved out. I ended up moving to Minnesota in 1987 and realized I should have gone straight to California. But it would be Minnesota where I would meet my husband (of 16 years), and give birth to my amazing kid, whom I adore more than anything else in my life. I married at 21 (going on 22) and my life began to "normalize" -- the person whom I had been diminished and set aside...but always there, this dark and weird side looming, always wanting to be out. It is this side of myself that often gets me into the most trouble. It seems to feed on lack of control, hedonism, and self-serving. There is always a time and place for everything.  In December of 97, we had the opportunity to move to California. My son was 15 months and we were to hit Northern California at the beginning of the internet bubble. We did the internet thing, but never really considered ourselves "dotcommers" in fact we detest that label. We consider ourselves web pioneers. We started our web building journey back in 94, when Yahoo was nothing but a place to list your homepage and Netscape was still in beta. We enjoyed Northern California immensely but then job opportunities took us south to Orange county -- Irvine where we spent 3 years. It was a mighty interesting 3 years too. Met some incredible people, some of whom I miss intensely, others not so much. Not sure if I will get used to the fact that I am no longer a "Californian..." but rather a "Floridian" which in itself is a foreign concept still.  So the big move to Florida. The weirdest thing is that I don't "miss" California, in fact I barely think about it....but I still feel lonely. I want to meet people, and feel like I belong somehow. But when you live among Boca Babes and Alligators, the future isn't always certain but it can be judged by who did your pedicure. Giggles.  Well I am exhausted. I am going to tie up some loose ends and get some sleep.

       In the middle of the night, my DH who normally isn't a mean person, turns to me and just got bloody angry. Saying how ungrateful I am of how hard he works and how I do nothing but chat and play with people. Well, gentle readers, I actually run my own company, Pregnancy.org ( urlLink http://www.pregnancy.org/ ) and I do my best to work hard every day. What prompted this was a benign comment I had made. He said that he works and works for me. I said no you work for all of us, to which he took offense because in his mind, he's making some huge sacrifice by working for the company he does now because he says, "You don't work..." I wonder some days if I just got some job as a secretary somewhere on top of doing this it would get him to not wig...but who knows.  In any case, DH's eye (which apparently has cysts on it that we're treating) started to bug out at about 4 in the morning. Whenever this man is sick or hurting he just lashes out. Oh did I mention that his parents moved 9 houses away on the same street? I think part of his crankiness is coming from that. But for one reason or another it is getting triggered by me. I am not sure what I am doing to him that makes him so resentful of me all the time. I cook, clean and try to take care of him the best I can. I try to make home peaceful and loving as best I can but instead I get insulted, told I am not good enough and that I am not doing anything. His mom says I should get a blue ribbon. I just want him to be happy. I don't even cheat on him or do anything that is unappropriate. I am sick of being chastised. I wish he'd just be happy. I think he's the one that needs Paxil not me. Oh well. Perhaps after he closes the project at work and doesn't have to deal with the unmentionable one (that is a separate entry all on its own...) then hopefully things will be better.  So now I am tired because I was up in the middle of the night taking care of him, rubbing his back, getting him a warm compress for his eye even after all the horrible crap that spewed from his mouth.  Okay it is now the end of the day, and whatever was bothering DH is gone now. So that's good. Whew. I hate it when he gets all wigged out. It is like having to walk on eggshells which sucks the big one.  Was an interesting day full of tears but also full of resolve. We even got to meet a neighbor tonight, who has the cutest, tiniest terrier named Jazzi. Totally a purse dog.  Okay enough for today.

      So what is a middle-aged (well 36) married female doing writing a blog? Being an insomniac that's what. Every night when everyone else is alseep, I seem to be the only one still awake at 1 am. Such is life. So this is me. These are my thoughts. Writing has always been cathartic. Like a painter, words have meant so much to me, helping me to describe my life, chaotic at times and dull and boring at others. My experiences have varied so much. Some of which I can share here and some I dare not. Well if I did, I might get into trouble.  Blogging. I really dig this. Rambling to no one, pouring my thoughts out for anyone to read. Is it reverse voyeurism? Seems like it in a way.  Today was productive. I seem to be able to focus on things and not drift off aimlessly somewhere...I am officially a Floridian now. Hard to believe having spent the last seven years in California. I miss California...something so magical about it. Guess it will always be that way. So now I am living La Vida Boca...."Rat's mouth" -- lovely. Actually West Boca Raton, where we live isn't really that bad. In fact, we're in a gorgeous house on a lake. It really could be worse. I am lonely though. Guess I will meet people soon enough. Not that I don't mind my own company but would be nice to have friends.  I haven't had much time for exploring but that will come too. And I better get exercising again. Holy crap, the weight is creeping back...ack! My continual battle with bulge. I have 30 pounds to go. Was 15 but gained it back while we were moving. Ugh. I feel like a beached whale. And to make matters worse, DH keeps buying goodies....ahhhhhhhhh run away...  Okay going to try and get some sleep. Goodnight my new blog. Such a cute pet.

       Charley -- third hurricane of the season, slams into Florida. Figures, we move from California and Florida gets the worst hurricane season in years. Apparently this year has been predicted to have more active tropical cyclones than previous years. Here is more information about Charley:   The Associated Press Updated: 5:08 p.m. ET Aug. 14, 2004 PUNTA GORDA, Fla. - Rescuers rummaged through a chaotic landscape of pulverized homes and twisted metal Saturday, racing to tally Hurricane Charley’s “significant loss of life” and help thousands left homeless by its vicious winds and rain. At least 15 people were confirmed dead.  As a weakened Charley churned into the Carolinas and was downgraded to a tropical storm, newly sunny skies revealed its destruction in Florida, where emergency officials pronounced it the worst to wallop the state since Hurricane Andrew tore through in 1992. Twenty-six deaths were directly linked to Andrew, which caused $19.9 billion in damage.  “Our worst fears have come true,” said Gov. Jeb Bush, who surveyed the devastation by helicopter. The Category 4 storm was expected to cost Florida “at least several billion dollars,” said Loretta Worters, spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute.  Ten deaths had been confirmed in Charlotte County, said Wayne Sallade, the county’s director of emergency management, but no exact death toll was available. “It’s Andrew all over again,” Sallade said.  “We believe there’s significant loss of life, he said, adding later: “I would hope that it would be limited to dozens, if that.”  He said “thousands upon thousands of people” lost their homes. Hundreds were unaccounted for in the county, which includes Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte, the apparent hardest-hit areas. Extensive damage was also reported on exclusive Captiva Island, a narrow strip of sand west of Fort Myers.       One can't help feeling relief that our area wasn't hard hit. But what about what others went through? Their hurt, devastation and anguish? What can we do to help those in need? Give to the Red Cross? The Salvation Army? We are left feeling helpless by these intense "acts of god" -- the acts that are out of our control.  As I watched the clouds roll in, the sky grow dark and menacing, the wind grew still...and not a drop of rain came. We had walked down nine houses to go to dinner at my in-laws. The night was a little breezy, but otherwise calm. You'd never know that 4 hours due West utter destruction was happening. It makes you remember how small you are and how huge this planet really is. I put the plants inside, stacked the patio furniture, and prayed a lot. I can only pray for those now who are homeless and suffering. Think we all should.

      Today is Ezra's first day of school. Thinking we'd have plenty of time to park and leisurely walk in we left the house at 7:35. Wrong! OMG between the crossing guards, hundreds of cars and the parking nazis he was almost late to school. So, I dropped him at the corner, told him to wait, I parked and then sprinted to catch up to him and help him carry all his junk in. Good grief they make them get a lot of supplies.  So we walk to his class watching everyone in their little uniforms (So cute!) and he sits down, I give him a "quick-nobody-can-see-kiss" and head back to the car, hoping I don't get a ticket. I think tomorrow we're walking or riding bikes. We're not that far but it's hot out! After walking 5 blocks ya get all sweaty. Hm. Perhaps I could work that into my daily workout. Now there is an idea. But that car/parking situation was horrible. They didn't make the lots big enough. Granted it was the first day of school but OMG what a zoo.  Enough complaining about that. I hope that the day goes well, he remembers to bring home his lunchbox and backpack and starts to make friends.  In other news, I will start to be HAIR FREE!!!! Finally gonna get all that lovely extra facial hair taken care of. Lasered right off. SSssssssssssssizzle. Actually it isn't a laser, it is an IPL system (http://www.bocabodylight.com) and won't hurt like the ruby laser I had four years ago. Friday is my first appointment and I can't wait! Ahhhh to be rid of it is dreamy. Will take a few months but sooooooooo worth it. Smoooth skin. Noooo bumps. No stubble. No feeling like a man 'cause I have to shave. Ugh. Okay back to your regular scheduled program. And I have to go get my munchkin. Leaving early this time. And as if on cue there is the thunder. Sigh.

      What a great morning! Today was open house at Ezra's new school. So we drove over to school to meet his teacher and get acquainted with the school a bit.   It is a really well-maintained school, with freshly painted murals of the ocean and its creatures, like killer whales, manatees and fish. The classrooms are shiny, bright and welcoming. I think that Ez will be in really good shape -- and he's so excited!  Ezra's teacher is named Ms. Davis -- a very nice middle-aged who appears to be hands-on teacher. Very enthusiastic. I am going to volunteer in class again, this time for Math (Sunshine math). I really enjoy volunteering and getting to meet all the kids.  We also had such a pleasant surprise today. Turns out that Ezra's friend from karate, Skye, is there in his class! Lisa, her mom came walking in and I was like, "HI!" and she smiled so widely as I think she was just as happy to see me. It was so cool. Ez was thrilled that he has someone in both his karate and regular class that he knows now. Skye is a purple belt, so as long as she stays at the studio those guys could become pretty good friends!  So tomorrow is the big day -- school at last, school at last! :)

      I have hurt a dear friend of mine very badly. How do I ever make up to them? How can I get them to feel better about a decision that affects them so deeply? Do I say you can hate my guys? Be angry? Hurl stuff at me? Beat me up? I don't know what else to say to make them feel better. I know that this friend will eventually learn to let go of those hurt and angry feelings, but it is going to take some time. In the meantime how do I let them know I love them very much and only wish them the utmost happiness in their life? I keep telling her this over and over and over but she doesn't hear me. It saddens me that she can't "hear" me and will only dwell on the negative feelings in her heart. Please hear me if you're reading this and know I love you and only want the best for you.

      Many members have asked over the years what the official story of Pregnancy.org might be; how we started, where we came from and what we’re really all about.  A couple of months ago, I posted the story on our bulletin boards. But in honor of our third anniversary, I’ve gone ahead and turned this into an article so that all members can read this at their own convenience. Way back in 1995, I got pregnant with my son Ezra (who is almost 8!). Back then as you can recall, the web was in its infancy. Netscape existed as a beta version and yahoo was for posting your homepage. I was getting sick and tired of going through book after book, trying to get information about my pregnancy. Most of the books were dry and boring, using scare tactics and didn’t have any feel of peer mentoring at all.   One Sunday morning, Minnesota, at the Golden Dome restaurant in St. Paul, our friends and I were discussing this very dilemma. Michael and Ted came up with the idea to create a  urlLink pregnancy calendar  that had a bit of information each day. Thus, the Olen Interactive Pregnancy Calendar was born. This calendar that we created doesn’t exist at Olen.com anymore, but it does as a part of iVillage. By the time Ezra was born, the site was doing well (for back then) and we even made it on CNN as a cool web site of the day. They did that in 1996 -- because well, the web was still pretty cool and new. We actually have our 15 minutes of fame on video. We ended up being written up in magazines like Yahoo! Internet Life, the Wall Street Journal, various newspapers and parenting rags.   So now we return to 1996. In the parenting and pregnancy space there were a couple of competitors—these being iVillage and ParentsPlace. Our friend Sabrina had her site as well as Robin Weiss, the creator of Childbirth.org (she now heads up the pregnancy section at About.com). Parentsplace wanted to mirror our pregnancy calendar and so we let them. In 1997 iVillage was on an acquiring binge and ate up Parentsplace. iVillage realized after that purchase that the calendar wasn't theirs and asked to purchase our site to get full rights to it. So, begrudgingly, in October of 1997, iVillage purchased the calendar and it is still one of iVillage's top draws.   Well, with that purchase, we moved to California in December of 1997. I stayed home with Ez and Michael went to go work for a startup. This was just the beginning of the internet boom. We landed first in San Jose, and then Sausalito, and later Mill Valley in the Bay area.   When Ez was 19 months, BabyCenter called Michael. They wanted him for his tech expertise. While I was there with Ez hanging out (this is 1998 already) the then editor-in-chief Clare Ellis asked me if I wanted to head up and start their community part time. Well, I said yes. Thus, BabyCenter's community was born. I was employee number 20 or there about. This was when BabyCenter only had 4 million page views a month (btw – we’re at 5 million). I eventually became full-time and worked there for 3.5 years. That is where I met some of you and my best friend Julie Snyder. Julie has been with me for over 7 years and if it wasn't for her, we wouldn't have most of the things you see on the site on a daily basis.   Michael did not end up working for BabyCenter, instead did the corporate thing and eventually got hired at a fortune 500 in Southern California (thus our move down to Southern California).   Fast forward to July 2001, we are in southern California—I left BabyCenter after weathering 2 layoffs and acquisitions. I was telecommuting and that was hard on me. After seeing all my friends let go and no one left that was innovative I did not want to be part of a corporate arm (Johnson and Johnson owns them now). I split that July (it was very political—BabyCenter still pretends we don't exist) and on September 10, 2001, launched Pregnancy.org. I never wanted our site to be a "me-too" site—with Michael, and some others who helped build and support us, we launched and here we are, almost 3 years later, growing very quickly and actually in the black and making money. This is our third company and I think third time is the charm.   So here I sit in beautiful Boca Raton, Florida. We moved our family and company to the East Coast in June. Pregnancy.org is thriving and we have all kinds of exciting plans for the site, including two expansion sites that will help round out the experience.  And that's the end of the story! For anyone that wants more information, you are always welcome to  urlLink email me directly . To all of you who make this site what it is, thank you, for all of you who help us on a daily basis double kudos to you. As the proverbial saying goes, ‘You are what you eat.’ Apply that to us, we are what we make of it.

      We went and saw the Manchurian Candidate remake today. I thought it was an excellent redoing of a very poignant topic -- the influencing of politics for personal gain.   We've seen nothing but this for the last 3.5 years under King George. Why do I say King George? Because he's acting like it. Not only was this moran appointed to the Presidency by the Supreme Court but he's ruined this country.  So, back to the Manchurian Candidate. Fascinating idea that some corporation would control the world including politicians. Well we're really not all that far off with Dick Cheney and his 7.5 million dollar SEC Fine. For god's sake, what is wrong with this country when we put away petty dope dealers and yet the Vice President gets away with anything? It saddens me immensely because no one seems to give a rat's ass. Not that a rat has much of an ass to give in the first place.  Can this country survive another four years of Bush? No, I don't think the world can sustain that. So in the Manchurian Candidate, without spoiling it for the rest of you, some big corporation covertly controls heads of state by using hypnosis and implants (no not the boobie kind either). Far fetched? Not really. Think about it. Obviously in the remake Manchurian is Halliburton. The whole thing with Bush and Cheney disgusts me. I don't see how folks can't see through it and what the situation really is. We have a man, who'd rather party, who is a moron, running this country and its reputation into the ground. And no one is doing a damn thing about it. Not the media, not our justice system, no one. Hopefully if Kerry gets in the first thing he'll do is appoint a special counsel and let these fuckers burn. Burn motherfuckers burn.
