Played softball..I busted myself up on field,slipping alot..1st cause Jackshen hit a grouner 2me..I was taking 1st base but from I got the ball,I couldnt see the base so I had to turn around and make a small semi circle and I snowplowed into him..ouch..then Debby hit a a little flar which I amazingly dropped and and fumbled to pick it up but still got the out..then En. Ramsah,my Physics teacher(who test i`ll be thankful if I even get a mark!or even half!)pitcehjd to me..he said not to nail him but I was like 'kalau saya pukul cigke,tak payah belajar physics lagi'!hahaahaha...then I smakced his pitch from abt 5feet away from the drain til like he handball court and sent 20 or 30 ppl running 4their lives...there was no home run rule since 'Cenpaka got their own rules'so I risked like getting thrown out cause I didnt run cause I stopped to admire and see how far my hit went..but easily scored..then game over..ugh lost..dumb teamates!

      Ok from now on im,putting those quiz results which identify me as a sadistic bastard or so..and this is no.2 now!Is this alarming or?     Sadist    urlLink   The ULTIMATE personality test     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     You're as dark as can get. You like to laugh at people, make fun of them, hurt their feelings. You're in so deep, you'll never get out, and you probably don't want to get out too. You make the world a darker place. Better get my flashlight...   Anger dominates you, you like to hurt things, animals, people, yourself? You find no other way to express yourself then through anger, or pain. Being alone for you can be a bad thing, then on the other hand it could be good. Please don't kill me.  src="http://images.quizilla.com/X/xdeadxstarx/1044037678_turesBlack.jpg" border="0" alt="Info Black"> Your Heart is Black    urlLink   What Color is Your Heart?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    You are a Twisted Angel. You are a strange one. Your path is unclear, and you often do strange things for the fun of it. No one can really discribe you, you are just too odd.  It makes my day seeing more things calling me dark,evil,whicked,sadistic bastard or worse..hehe  I feel like a lsoer putting these but its really 'entertaining' cause it says the truth abt me..im not like the angel im potrayed as...  Heh im remember eysterday that me and Afandi were laughing goin down like 3flights of stairs laughing like jackasses cause I told that during days that he didnt come,1 teacher pronounced Idzmil`s name as  'Cocksmil'!!!LMAO!ROFLMAO!!!  anyway thats it!later!

         My life has been rated:     urlLink        urlLink See what your rating is!      Personality quiz Your score is 36/50 what does that mean?  Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.    About your score... The closer to fifty that the number is, the stronger your personality is. The closer to zero that the number is, the weaker your personality. The best scores to have are between 25 and 40.  Your are(me) 75% in control of your life.  what does that mean?  You have a healthy mix of internal drive and belief in external forces (fate, your friends, coworkers, luck). You know when something is your job, and if you want it to turn out good, you will work on it. You also know when something is beyond your control, and you're usually OK with that.   Im like an ectascy drug ;-)..parties 2 much!oh yeah!and when I can party I party 2death!over doing at times(what drug are u quiz)  Woohhoo!Im like Zack from Saved By The Bell!I miss that show!(which saved yb the bell charatcer are u)  and im like 75% exciting!wohoo!Now lets invite me,spend me and have fun!(I have fun..I dont care abt u!hahah!)  Yeah so just go to Michelles blog(its on the sidebar) and all those links and more are inside there..id paste it here,but the html is giving problems and trying to link things using this blog is terrible!   Hmm the links to the place are  on  'Michelle`s Blog'link(the links inside her diary/journal/blog/whatever u call it)(thnx Mich!)...id put it here but I cant figure out why the html codes are giving problems..

        Solitude  Your lyrics  How many times have you told me you love her? As many times as I wanted to tell you the truth. How long have I stood here beside you? I lived through you, you looked through me.  Ooo, Solitude Still with me is only you Ooo, Solitude I can't stay away from you  How many times have I done this to myself? How long will it take before I see? When will this hole in my heart be mended? Who now is left alone but me?  Ooo, Solitude Forever me and forever you Ooo, Solitude Only you, Only true  Everyone leaves me stranded, forgotten, abandoned left behind. I can't stay her another night  Your secret admirer, who could it be?  Can't you you see all along it was me? How can you be so blind as to see right through me?  Solitude Still with me is only you Ooo, solitude I can't stay away from you  Solitude Forever me and forever you Ooo, Solitude Only you, Only true    urlLink   What Evanescence song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      dunno if done this but fuck it..though I think I have but lets see what it says this time..

      I've been searching for you I heard a cry within my soul I've never had a yearning quite like this before Now that you are walking right through my door.  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again  A sacred gift of heaven For better, worse, wherever And I would never let somebody break you down. Or take your crown... never  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again  At every time, I' ve always known That you were there, upon your throne A lonely queen, without her king I longed for you, my love forever  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I' ll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I' ll ever see you again  All of my life... repeat  two times All of my life where have you been I wonder if I' ll ever see you again I wonder if I' ll ever see you again I wonder if I' ll ever see you again I wonder if I' ll ever see you again  I wonder if I' ll ever see you again I wonder if I' ll ever see you again I wonder if I' ll ever see you again

        You are a moon shadow. With the moon as your source you are a being of great mystery. Constantly drifting, you descend into darkness to conceal your brokenness.  You have come to believe that you are the only one you can rely upon for constancy and safety that you need.  But those who know how to see you find enchanting beauty in your wistfulness and fragility.  It is to them that you should flee, for their arms are an open haven where your true light can finally thrive..(please rate my quiz cuz it took me for freaking ever to create)    urlLink   What Kind of Shadow Are You?

      Yeah you heard it went babe!Went for Saturday night fever!Though on a Thursday night hehehe..anyway 1st lets see what I did that certain day before seeing probably the best musical or show/perfomance ive seen before or in a long time!  1.  Played soccer today man...it was bloody nasty...Beruangs and Helangites vs those Seladangs and Harimaus...damn nasty la the game...lost 4-3..damn haha..some Beruang guy kept handballing!haha..I had an AWFULLY EMBARASSING GAME!Always had trouble clearing,couldnt connect with the ball properly..and always let it slip thru..terrible..violent oso...I got runned over by Wai Luen and sufferd some pretty nasty cut on my left palm..Hafiz legs collided with mine really hard to him...Zainul ended up with some nasty cuts to after some huge collisian with some guy..after a while I got frustrated defending and left it to Ian Jim and Gavin at the back and I pushed foward heheh..started playing along the right wing with Chris and also has a central midfielder...almost turned into a Guily but nah..dumb Wei Jay Sern..my PERFECT LEFT FOOTED cross(how odd!got the ball up in the air with my left foot!)ok fine took a deflection off Wai Luen and went to him and the idiot sent it over the bar!hahahah dumb!  2. Ok slept during Thiru`s class...hahahahaahahahaha he said I was the only guy in the class who made it by sejarah the moment I woke up from sleeping and he didnt notice...what a STONER!then did nothing..played that hahaha kinda weird but filled with sick perverted influences murderd and detective..damn sick..got sexual abuse man,gig,pros,masturXXXXXXxx,damn sick man.Then ciaoed off...oh yeah lotta ppl went for BEP but I didnt!Why waste my money on a group i`m not a big fan of?Unless someone paid for me...  3. Wanted to go get my haircut but my aunty came by to give some fish thing her daughters boyfriend got fishing..and when she left it rained like crap!Worse rain and traffic jams in Kuala Lumpur this year at least!took my dad 2hours 2get home from the offcie..more even and he left at *gulp* 6pm????wtf????  4. So he finally got home and we left..thank god my driver was driving so he was faster thna my parents would ever have gone..made alot of detours cause of traffics jams caused my u know la the rain,rising river water levels...got there at 9:30pm!fuck!Luckily started late so missed the 1st HaLF HOUR!Bitch!!  5. Oh yeah now for the biggest thing almost!The perfomance!Had the rm227 thatwere like 5 or 6rows away from the stage on the left side of the hall..  Ok dunno what happens 1st half hour but its abt Tony Manero,a Brooklyn or something..yeah..painter living a humble life but spending all high dough on clothes and stuff and becomes a different on the dance floor basically..always at 2001 Odyssey knwona s the best dancer around...He appears or is at least in his parents eyes as someone with no hope and dispite getting a raise on his job for 4dollars,he is still laughed at..and in the meantime,his brother Frank decided to return home leaving the church as a priest and all..  He dumps almost his old dancing partner Annette pretty much as he eyes for Stephanie a good looking blonde dancer who as like him,is sought after as a dancer and bla but with no real education..he pretty much then gets her and gets her to take part in the 2001 Odyssey dance competion..they won it cause his friends rigged the vote but he gave the trophy to the 2nd placed Puerto Ricans who deserved it more than them...he feels like hes let everyone down..  His friend Bobby C. whos gotten his girlfriend pregnant climbs up the Brooklyn bridge and all and falls off after trying to show he wasnt a coward like everyone said he was cause u know..he bakced out of the gangs fight with some other guys..the ambulance sirens sounded and the next scene was him sitting at the park under the bridge thinking..Stephanie who he had a fight with on the 2001 night consoles him..finding him there after he said he goes there to think..with him quiting from his job to help her move to Manhattan,his best friend dying,losing the dance competion and his parents deeming him a failure hes broken just as was Bobby C singing 'Tragedy' earlier after no1 seemed to care for and about him..So they start singing and it seems to get better for him who then decided he will move to Manhattan as well!  Its then ended with like 3 or 4dances and then asking the crowd to stand up and started dancing..haha..MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!Then my driver came..we went home..wow..the view of KL from those elevated highways..very nice and Ampang-gy hehe..  Then went to Pelita for supper at like past midnight..met Francis..had of course Nasi Kandar ler..ehe..then balik at like 1am..hehehe then went online mocked Wei Ning and then had a bath at like 2am or so and slept at 3am..hehe..

      Woah today was a possbaly violent or but definately different day.  Its really cause of this zainul and Benjamin thing..  I think it started from before but it didnt erupt til today..Aperently Ben has been going through ppls bags 4no reason WITHOUT their consent...appearently Divyesh lost his tie and he saw Ben goin thru his bag..hes reporting it 2moro and I heard mine was gone through..though nothing missing im bringing it up..  Anyway back to it.  Zainul during art had gone to the toilet and guess what!he came back to class,he saw Ben goin through Haziqah(his girlfriend)`s bag..and he scolded Ben abt goin thru ppls bags and they started arguing...Ben seemed not to care..Zai was bloody pissed..  Then during break or at the end of it,Zai was shouting away at Ben who then started becoming a racist and started mocking Zai..I was the closest 2 Zainul pretty much..I was throwing away some trash I had and my head turned upwards and bam!Arguing man..I could see Zai`s veins popping out of his neck and he really wanted to punch ben which wasnt a good idea..Bens like fucking huge and zai is tall but thin u know..and b4 he did anything stupid i pulled Zainul away before he did something stupid and/or something he would regret...we got into a little shoving match..he pushed me away a bit but I pushed him back and he stormed off and disappeared..  Turns out he went to the office...2report this  Anyway during math Miss Tok came by and wanted 2 see Ben..*the moment kind of music*..then some form1 or 2guys came by 2get bens belongings which me and Alex Wung fixed up...anyway maths 2dya was easy...and hahaha Afandi wasnt here(absent)so class was generally much more peaceful..haha..Then saw zai writing something on a peice of paper outside class after math but every1 generally left him alone..  Then passing by the office..Ben at almost perfect timing 'has a migrain headache'..I wonder if its real..hardly anyone belives its real...bastard..His father was there..damn his dad`s alot smaller than him!  Then Zai returned in the middle of BM class crying kinda..dunno why..anyway he thanked me during lunch for restraining him..I felt like I had to do something..And I think ben could finally get expelled..every year got some problems like this..But fear a bit for Zainul..in school Ben can just be expelled but outside?You know what kinda person Ben is..  hahaha pity Farouq who could hardly breathe during chemistry cause Pn farah was at the back and scared because he`s together with her daughter..damn..haha..  hmm damn Jon Lee has a new phone..dman chun...ugh that tomboyish girl was being a big ass pest 2 Cheryl and also getting on my nerves as I was talkin 2her....next time happens..im gonna give her a tounge lashing..ppl these days..hahaha I crossed the street not to get 2my car but to 'get away from Cheryl'hahaha!  shit Thomas Cup on..big ass fight now!g2g see it!ciao!  Riz.

Talking about money..according to the newspapers,with the number of people migrating from all over the place eg...outside of the city from other states and even Indonesia,KL`s becoming poorer and could be like  NYC  (New York City) by 2009...could the financial situation be that bad?But certainly crime could possably be..with all these coming in..dunno who they are and what kinda characters...and damn damn damn...  Once again lazing here in my room all day on the laptop bugging ppl to come here with the new template and all..

Ok so read Mu 1-1 against Chelsea..nm next year Mu will rise atop english football!And hey,they still got the FA cup final against Millwall to salvage something from this relatively awful year..though i`m sure Denise Wise and co.wont let Mu have it just like that!He`s an ex-Chelsea captain and a battler!  So ok did some pic fixing up for Wei Ning..took a bit time after I found the programs to get it work and bla and editing,it was a peice of cake!

Then after school was talking to Alia and Zia and like those guys called or referred to as 'the twins' that are from Cempaka are actually from Cempaka Cheras...their names are Shaznin and Shazli or something..appearently the word 'cute' and 'hot' or something are associated with them by girls there so seem to be following them all over!But according to Alia,they aren`t cute and are dumb!haha..And she says they are like 'posers'.But a different version.A version of a poser except that they are nerdy and geeky looking fags with their pants pulled up to immpossable heights!Haha!So I told Yii Ping and she was like maybe were just jealous and I told her that girls said that and shes like 'aiks!'.haha...  Then had to go to Ampang and pick up mom and dad from the doctors palce since its my moms monthly check-up cause she has high blood pressure and stuff now...So it took like fucking long to get there!Jammed like crap...500 meters away oso can take like 15 minutes to get to!Anyway picked em up and avoided the jams and went back through Damansara..  my brother Jal came..and brought lotta stuff from grandma`s house in Taiping..and had nasi briyani for dinner..heh...the paper thats used to bungkus the nasi briyani plastic packet had the thing about the YKLS singing that Rodgers and Hammerstien..was thinking about finding Cheryl in the picture..and I think I found her and conteng her :P :P :P.Lmao.Decided dinner sounds better.Lmao.Oh yeah it was the Malay Mail even..now what date I dunno..maybe i`ll put it up later...

Then went out to the pasar malam but just grabbed a Cranberry Tea Frap from Starbucks..a Grande sized one..A drink flavour which I hadn`t had since PMR Results day 2003!Although much cooler,a grande didnt even last a quarter of how long it lasted last time!Despite all the walking!But my blood my hot so had to cool down..sigh...was thinking of something hot to sizzle myself up but thought its best I cool down instead..sigh sigh sigh..!Cooled down though...  Turns out Wei Ning is NOT going to acc on Fridays..no!!!How could she!!!!lol..  grabbed pelita on the go and met Shu Yong on the way back..  ate.bathed.did homework.Blargh.  Riz.

NOW.Stuff came up and I missed Rodgers and Hammerstein!Gurhg.Then another thing came up which left my blood boiling and sizzling more than the sizziling steaks at the Collesium!  Then!.Impatientness.Urgh.No point in writing it out.I`ll just be a bigger bitch.  Then I scolded away at the Jahiliyah fella.called a guy a bastard is public and regret NOT saying it out LOUDER than I already did.Gurgh.  Gurgh.So much high BP and so little cures.Gurgh.Much more here done but i`ll leave so it aint bring em back to my mind.And I grabbed my gloves and busted away at everything I can..punching bag,rolled up carpers..Yikes.Sounds like I need help.I have a burning spot on my right elbow and a slight wound on my right ring finger knuckle and I was wearing gloves!but gloves were alright..haha..  *HISSSSSEEESSSSSS AT THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!*

       Hmm you know something?I think the way the title is written is damn nice.Perhaps I shall write my titles in this way from now on.What do you people think?  And yes.Report card day was yesterday.I got so fucking screwd!Anyway England lost to Portugal!muahaha!David Beckham should go and play rugby and replace the currently injured Johnny Wilkinson and take kicks!David James should be playing in Division 1!And yay.I now have officlaly beaten Afandi 5 times in a row.Now I tadak untung or rugi.Not bad eh?Can I make it 6 in a row babY?  Well Farouqs parents werent coming but they knew his results.Afandi`s excuse was damn funny.He said he told him mom only that morning in the car as she was sending him to school.He very well knew she had a function and said nevermind,she can come and collect his report card the next report card day.and she asked when is it and he replied "after the year end exams" and she asked when is that,he said "in a few months".Walaumak!What a fucker wei!And his results were awful.Haha.When he tells it,its like so funny.Aheheh.  So Div said hes screwd.Zainul as well.Mughni said his dad turned red and pissed.Haziqah decided not to stick around for hers.Wei Hoong kena tiu by Mr. Ashwin for missing his exams.Alex Loh oso kena ka0-kao.And so did I.Constance so lucky.Pn.Sharifah said she didn`t have to call her parents to come.What a lucky girl!  So we played bottlecap football in class.Haha.All the games I played,my team won!And I rarely play.Hehe.Everytime got open goal a three hundred poudner in Afandi will come from behind and give a sliding tackle.crazyLingesht oso join in.mad.How to score?Haha Farouq kena injrued like mad and Afandi started laughing and we all were laughing at Afandi`s laugh.Heh.  anyway,I talked to haziqah and she perhaps could be lucky.But she was scared and so was I.Yikes!And dad came at 11 am or was it 11:30 am..and then had to wait a while as Idzmil mom was there and he kena fuck as well.and Pn Sharifah talked shit abt me.Damn her!And my ccr was the opposite of what she said about me!  So went home and kena like mad from my parents!die man...ugh...then went Mid Valley..jammed all the way man..didn`t expect that..then went my Best Dengki looking for a new DVD player..lookin 4 samsung so itll work ni tandum with muh TV..then MPH and got some books..  Yay!Wei Ning is now going for Francis acc tuition on Fridays!Wee!and haha she called me and wnated 2 meet up but I said I was late for class and wanted go anyway.Hehe.and she skipped cause she was tired cause she just finished her exams.And heard Wen-Di was stuck in the Mid Valley jam.Muahaha.  So I was late for tuition by 10mins and was still early!Francis came in jsut after I did and so did Gb and Ju Ean wa slate by 20mins!haha at 1st iw as the only one at the abck which Marcus was 'special'.Heh.then he joined cause couldnt see from the side.then the girls came and stuff...so after tuition waited for Ju Ean to leave so talked with her 4 a while...then when she left went to Bk and got dinner...tlaking to her caused alotta time 2go by so put off Starbucks and saved my money :D :D :D :D!!!!WEEEEE!  Anyway went home and did the same routine and stuff...go online..sleep at 3am...watched begginging of France and Greece quaterfinal match..anyway thats all I did..  Riz.

        Well I finaly have turned my streak against Afandi to 4 in a row with my victories in  group D! Muahaha.  Didn`t have PE as Pn Sharifah was teaching commerce...and I doubt we`ll have PE for the next few weeks as no one wants to go for the swimming test :p.Oddly the school has a swimming pool and yet many people (including me) don`t know how to swim!Actually a lot of people (also including myself) can swim but we just arent interesting in swimming in front of everyone else.heh.Just something we all don`t like doing!By the way,I can swim good enough so I don`t drow.heh.A dog paddle master.Haha.  Aside a boring day and once again laughing in Sejarah class while Mr.Tiru was going about with his 'hardcore students' thing and stuff...In Physics I started scolding the class`s orang jahiliyah yang datang dari Zaman batu terawal (?) or lets jsut Wei Hoong.He`s is so annoying!I had to calm myself down and cool down so I wouldnt lose it and start yelling at him.There was no teacher and the class was noisy so other classes were complaining and everyone was keeping quiet because the office threatened to make us stay back til 5pm...so I had to keep calm which thankfully I did...  Divyesh himself said Wei Hoong is likely the most annoying person he has ever met before.Constance almost said the same thing and she was laughing when she heard Div say what he did.She was doing a little bit of the jahiliyah fella`s work and then she felt lazy and decided he`s not worth her effort.Haha.Serves him right.  And I went home...then went out and grabbed a whopper over 1  can of coke and before that finishing a half opened pepsi in the fridge..and got that L'oreal Invisi gel..ugh..turns out the extra strength isnt on sale and the normal strength was the one on sale and four bucks less!Anyway screw it..ill just claim back from my dad :D :P ..hehe..  Then slept all the way!Hehe.til like 7 pm before mom woke me up and scolded me like shit...then ironed my uniforms..2 of them somemore..took forever...and not exactly that..had nasi kandar from Pelita as usuall.and slept at err dunno la 2am?haha..  Riz.

        Everyone though or because of Afandi la...that the advertisement was for Cempaka cause Datin Freida went by the studio earlier...turns out that was for something else and not anything to do with us..Turns out we were recording an advetisement for MAA..that errr Malaysian Automobile association?I dunno la!But I think thats what it was!  So I followed Divyesh there as his mom was sending him..and went to Afandi`s uncle`s office along Jln Maarof..met Idzmil and Jamal there who were there to record the advertisement as well..and Imran..Fendi`a cute 7 or 8 year old cousin was there.               So basically what we had to do was to say YES and YA!Its like backround voices for the ad so you cant quite tell our voices :p.so we were like 1-2-3 yes!..the 1st three were like loud but not as loud as the last one!and the same for 'YA!'.Haha.They had the girl voice version of it.They just needed the guys version and they new who to look for :D.Anyway we didn`t get paid but got fresh hot pizza from Pizza Hut to make up for it :D.  anyway it was damn fun..Afandi wa showing us his cheap card tricks and his cheap coin tricks which he claim were 'magic'.haha.Damn cheap man.  So like the 1-2-3 part we took turns saying..each time wit idzmil or Jamal we got it wrong..so under my leadership..we got it all perfect wei!Cehlamak!They called it 'American Leadership'.Haha.Damn funny la...afandi`s uncle came in the recording room when Idzmil and Jamal were pretending to be pro singers.Heh.Oh yeah Afandi`s tricks or so called skills with Imran`s magnetic toys were damn funnyily fake.And when saying YA...Afandi said.."I thought Divyesh said yuck".What and idiot!  Anyway it took 5 minutes in all to it all..Fendi`s uncle kept the whole thing running so when we heard the playback damn funny cause it recorded all our rants in the middle of the recording.Lol.  So like one day were planning to record our own album man...then distribute all over school..cehlamak!Famous then man..so then Afandi sent all us back and me 1st..  Ok please forgive me for such imcomplete details and a weird blogging style thats simliar to my old style..just that I aint got much of a mood to blog..sorry!  Riz.Now thats still there!

         Oh crap I just dropped my sun case with my sunshades in em.Yikes.Blh haha.  Despite my hope of staying up to watch Euro2004,it was in vain..couldn`t wake up..oh grr..alarm rang at 3am but I told it to go to hell so I think you get the picture...anyway muahaha!Italy (although they were partly my favourites to win Euro 2004) are eliminated!Haha! Serves them right!They may cry foul over the Sweden Denmark match drawing 2-2 which eliminates them and with Sweden getting a last minute equaliser and them Italians celebrating Antonio Cassano`s injury time winner when Sweden scored.Muahaha!They have the best players in the world at every position yet they couldn`t beat Denmark and drew to Sweden thanks to Giovanni`s Trappatonni`s idiotic substitutions bringing off strikers for defenders!He is so defence minded!..I mena..why be so when hey let in a goal,you have the fire power to score another 2 or 3?Stupid if you ask me...  Despite acheiving like almost 6 or is it 7? hours of sleep,I was once again walking around perpetually stoned as usuall at school..And it was relatively a normal day..rather boring but actually not!Afandi`s antics in Math kept me ,Ck and Shahril all laughing to death and left Mr.Lee staring weirdly...and haha..Au Yong and his insulted times from Mr.Lee.haha.And Fendi`s dumb 'magic' tricks which were cheap and fake and down right stupid and funny when you laugh when something goes wrong and he stumbles and fumbles to recover his composure and make it all seem correct again and yes.Mughni or 'Mugini' as by our acc teacher,is at his sick best.Lol.wOHOO!I got 70 for agama!Amazing!Who woulda thought Id get so high!? Certainly not me!  So I got home,and slept til about 6pm..then went for that MAA advetisment recording..which i`ll descrbie in my next entry after I do some homework but should be in a few hours!

       I stayed up the whole dman night and watched flipping in between France vs Switzerland and England vs Croatia..ok so I won the bet with Afandi so now I owe him like rm30 instead of rm40 though I payed him back 10rm now I owe him rm20 .Now my bets are going my way!hehe!Maybe my luck can continue :D    Haha..So there was an english test today which I think I handled pretty well...and then BM had a test as well but not so simple..it was based on a picture so I hentam write about the picture 1 or 2 paragraphs then write the kesan cause the tittle was kesan buruk permainan video kepada remaja remaja dan kanak kanak I think..  Then me and half the class got scolded like shit for not doing econs notes..moody bitch...then sejarah was another funny time..."dont be stupid".Lol.I`m just to lazy to write everything man..Then computer abt 10 or more fellas kena sound like fuck my ashwin for not doing their practicals or is it theorys..hahaha then he told them to get out so it was nice and peaceful while he explained about and how Adobe Photoshop works...interesting...sounds like fun!For once computer class is something to look foward to :D!  Then after school talked with Alia,Nick Q,Zia..and demonstrated our 'special skills'.lmao..for more on that..just ask me!It may sound weird but its funny.And yes Nick Q has plenty of reasons why he cant be blamed for taking a chainsaw and cutting off my head :p.lmao...funny character..  Then came home..ate..slept all the way til 7 something pm..hehe..my eldest bro`s in town and stuff...  Ok I still dunno when im going for Cheryl`s Rodgers and Hammerstein....going for Black Light Theatre on the 6th of July 2004 and then tommorow or pretty much today going to record some advertisement for Cempaka at Afandi`s uncles studio along Jalan Maarof..  so Thats all..maybe will wake up and watch a bit of the Euro 2004 matches..we`ll have to see..later..

        Yesterday was better than it had looked at first.They gave out the Games Carnival Awards trophy and stuff..I sadly didn`t get anything this time unlike the Big Splash 2004 time when I received my MSSKL Handball medal back..so heh.When Afandi went up on stage to collect his Rugby awards,like some group namely me,Aaron,Yong How,Divyesh,Hoong Zhang and other who were sitting in the Seladang & Helang area were yelling 'Fundiii'Haha..now thats rather embarassing isn`t it?A few people yelling your name like that.Hehe.Well it ultimately took over one hour so we missed BM!Wee!  Heh..during english Mrs.Rama started yelling at Zainul and told to get outta class..so when he got up she got the wrong person..actually was saying to Mughni in front of class but called him Zainul by mistake :p .Math was perhaps boring a little bit but all fine..Slept in agama as well..so bloody tired now these days..now I am truly becoming a sleep lover though I need coffee now these days very often at very short intervals of time :X .  Anyway didn`t do much when I got home from school..dad`s gone off to Penang on bussiness...so not much food in the house...and Mr.Chang was here for ours just to get interior designing slightly verified :X .So at like 9:30pm or so he left and I was able to go to Burger King and grab dinner for me and my mom...whopper..chicken royale and large fries..yum!  And wow!Portugal have made it through!Hahaha..I say it serves Spain right for dropping Morientes with Fernando Torres when its clear Raul should make way...Valeron didn`t play enough and Xavi didnt play and he was so on form this year for Barcalona!Well to bad for Spain!hahah!Nuno Gomes was a culprit last time wasnt he?Well revenge I guess!And very interestingly Greece is through.I now owe Afandi rm40 instead.If I had bet matches which I didnt...I woulda won through the odds...mother..haha..And like I said I created an LJ for commenting at other people`s sites...ill add the link later along with some other new links.

       Woke up at like 8am and headed off to school to do my computer project..Divyes followed as well..our good Jahiliyah friend from zaman Mesoloitik Au Yong Wei Hoong was there already and was at his annoying best god..grr..So basically messed around with my project..Divyesh was going through my wallet for logos and showed Chen my Killer Loops.Hehe.And Mr.Ashwin was even on the phone scolding Afandi..haha..Farouqs handpone battery went out on him and he lost his reference for his and Idzmil`s drawing of Calvin from Calvin & Hobbes..but he`s lucky Zainul got the same phone so he took his battery :p.So my project is fucking shit..bastard fuck Ashwin..he said he`ll give me 50%just so I could pass and then said he had to discuss with Dr.Rizal just cause I barely used handtools and used symbols and brushes.HELLO.He didn`t say I couldn`t fully symbolize almsot then..fucking fat whore..now he says he wants to give me 20 or 30 marks which sure la confirm i`ll be lowest in the god damn form.After messing around with the gradients and making layer after layer which was like 17 in all,I though finish.I added stars and what not and the silverish light was like the moon on a black skyline..everyone else said it was quite nice..but he and my project can go to hell..So what if I used symbols?If he didn`t want them he shoulda SAID SO.In fact he said I used almost nothing but symbols and then bitched about using so littles that he could count.But fuck it.I had to leave and go outta town.So I told him thats my final save.and if I knew about some of those things even earlier,then hell,id make one even nicer than it already is City Skyline at Night!  So got home at like 11am and started getting the car ready and stuff...Wan Chor was following and stuff cause alot of her stuff is still at Tok Mak`s hse in Taiping and bla..So dad drove and I got to sit in front!wee!And I programmed the radios sound to go only to me so even better!We like left at 12pm past and needed or hoped to get there by 4pm so we could give the Kuala Kangsar House keys to the real estate agent..So the car was just serviced and the car was generally quite light and stuff..so the car was quite smooth..at times my dad was going at like 150 kph at times and he didn`t notice..in fact his average was 120 or 130kph..and even at 150 kph mad drivers are still tail gating..crazy..So got there in time!Didn`t even take 3hours to get to the place..then went for lunch at Yut Sun.  Then went to the house and stuff..and took down the curtains and bla..god..the hse is so dusty and so termitish...hehe I know have lotsa small change :p.  So stayed up til like 5am to watch Czech Republic take on Holland..I bet with Afandi 10bucks..after 19mins Holland up 2-0..I was dancing all over the place but the Czechs who is one of my favourites to win the whole thing proved their dark horseness and took advantage of Phillip Cocu`s horrendous mistake and dumb tactical changes and an opponent getting sent off..babi I owe him rm50 now :p..shit it was damn scary..all sorts of noises through out the house..walked around to see what was the noises but there was ..gulp..nothing!I was already planning to take some of those knives on the table and arm myself and attack anything except my family of course :p..Maybe it was mice that made all those noises?I dunno..but it was s a c a r y !  So then woke up at like 10am..did more stuff..then went out with dad to get garbage bags and drinks...and some bastard took our parking space so I yelled 'BASTARD' at the guy when he was exiting his car..Serves the fucker right..people were staring even..lol..then got the stuff..  Then went back to the house and like got all the damn stuff ready..bathed and I had to get the 'For Sale' sign off the fence!And I heard that there was a snake at the house before but didn`t know wether if it was inside or outside the house so like I tip toed across the grass and jumped on the fence and inched along the thing holding it up and what not...then had to spend like half a minute trying to rip the sign off..thankfully dman windy..heh and I had sunglasses on baby :D..then I ran across the grass faster than I had ran lately...no snake though but why take the risk?If there was a snake,id grab the sulfur on the floor and throw it at it and say "EAT SOME SULFUR BITCH!!!" and runaway..hehe..  So got all the motherfishing stuff in the car and left for Kuala Kangsar..front seat again..yay..dropped by the house...and then ate by the river and what not..then left..  So reached home at like 10pm or so...had nasi kandar from Pelita and slept at 1am..had been sms-sing with Steffi for like the last 24 or so plus hours..I musta sent like 60 or 70 sms with maybe 50 to her hehe ;-)..heh..anyway not much else more for here...ciao ciao..

So sejarah I got only 60%!I could I?And I got 78/100 for paper 2!Only missed out on 11 marks for the structure questions!And also 11 marks looking at it for essay!So good eh ;-)?Hehe..but damn..my bad part was the objective paper...only 22/40 correct!But the objective paper is memang damn hard...I feel its the hardest part of the paper!The essays so simple cause I can remember it from form 3 studying for PMR that time and all last year..hehehe..So I didn`t study that much except for the begging hehe...But Somehow I think there`s been a miscalculation of my marks for history..when I go to school tommorow,I`m so gonna double check my paper and how the marks are totalled up!I cant belive got just that much for all that?Hmm..interesting eh?  So that problem Shaun has kinda happened after school..I`m not gonna say what it is..find it out for yourselves..he can be said to have escaped this time perhaps.Hmm I think that now perhaps there`s gonna be an emergancy assembly about this.I`m sure someone would complain about like five guys in street clothes talking to a student in a quiet corner on the lower ground floor..damn..hope not!  So betting with Afandi Holland vs Germany..i`m Holland..square game...haha..  Sarah want`s me to get her a coffee maker :P.hahaha..maybe I will?hehe!But I need money 1st though!haha..And Eric got Farouq that new Nokia N-Gage QD or is it QPD?Oh whatever!From Japan!Bugger!Cheaper there though it seems..not surprised..with the technology they have over there,it should be cheap but not over here with the standard of technology here :p.  Ok anyway i`m crapping..gonna sleep now..then wake up for the Germany and Holland game!Later!  Riz.

So went home..ate like a hog..then slept til about 6pm..then went out..mom was off to the dentist so she wanted me to follow so I followed her up the place and then went to Starbucks and got a Coffee of the Day (COD) which was a Cafe Verona..tall...I needed something hot to wake my senses up..and ugh...had to stuff sugar like mad..couldn`t find creamer..must ask them about it whenever I get that kinda drink again..So like sat down and let myself slowly wake up..sat at the same table as Saturday..the furthest out table..sat for like 75 minutes and left at 7:15pm..called Chaman and talked..and walked around Bangsar slowly..my hood man!I should know what happens there baby!Then went home at about 8:20pm..  Then went out for dinner at Mahbub..had naan and tandoori..did a small bit for charity..then went home at like 10pm..  Then couldn`t sleep man!Or still can`t and its like almost 4am..originally planned to wake up at 3am and do homework (eg sejarah and commerce) but nah..just got outta bed..took me about an hour or so..not long..then went downstairs and had a grape donut I think eh no wait!It`s blueberry!haha!I didn`t know!What a moron I am =p .Ate that and drank milk and had Cappucino ice cream while watching the first half of the the Sweden vs Bulgaria match...balls damn accurate...the Bulgarians looked dangerous specially Berbatov and Martin Petrov...damn..but Sweden scored after Zlatan Ibrahimovic beat the offsides trap and unselfishly passed of to Ljungberg to tapped it in home.. for 1-0..left at halftime..wanted to blog a bit and hopefully sleep...gonna need a nice coffee to stay up tommorow man!Or today.Heheh.  Oh yeah turns out parents complained at SMBB that they said they went by the school and saw students there kissing and bla..and hugging and now the schools trying to clamp down on couples in school I belive.Hello?? WHATS WRONG WITH HUGGING??Tadak keperimanusiaan (did I get that right) betul la..Come Ssc means gone..everyone will kena for hugging :D :D.Hehe.So I think that puts a few certain 'friends' of mine over there in a fix.Muahaha.I wonder how they are gonna 'make it through this' and work things out.Hahaha.I need to see a doctor about my sadism really!It`s worrying..but not to me..!hehe!And Alia thinks I have a 'sardonic' laugh.Muahaha.Ok fine its true!its true!

        Well this entry will be a long entry...this one is gonna contain all sorts of rants,rambles,muses,views,thoughts,news,flashbacks,dream and other crap that I feel I can share with whoever reads my blog though I doubt anyone does..and in the end...it wont be as long as the entry in my mind..cause in my mind..is where all the personal stuff shall be posted and kept forever..  Well what to start off with...i`m going on emotions right now..and whats on my mind right now most importantly.Sigh.I`m homesick.Yeah I miss home..Kent,Ohio is still home to me..it has a special place in my heart...Now its summer holidays there...schools out for three months for everyone there...sigh and here is schoolling time and year end holidays are only 2months..sigh..its summer over there..and the weather beautiful.It may be hot but hell its baseball season baby!The flowers have grown..waiting to be plucked and blown or given to someone has a nice,friendly,loving gesture..the sprinklers are on...perfect time to go swimming or grab a tan...go on vacation...go outside and play with your friends...or relax and saviour the moment..and catch up on a book..visit the nearest mall..sales..shopping or go out and eat...roadtrips...or even summer classes for those who want to graduate early or catch up or revise what they have learnt or are gonna learn in the next schoolling year..no more waking up early to catch the bus to school...no more bringing around bag full of school books but bringing a bag of clothes to wear when you sleep over at your best friends place..the movies right now are hot..and definately benefitting from modern technology which is making them evem more and more exciting..or in fact get a job?paper boy?run the ice cream stall?why not get some extra pocket money and cash?And did I forget to mention ice cream...?Oh so many flavours to choose from...and all are nice in their own special way..Klondikes...Popsicals..Creamsicals..so many..why not attend a baseball game with dad or ur friends sigh..so much to do...and more time than we people over here in M`sia get...an endless ammount of activities to do and take part in!!!  I look back at my Walls Elementry yearbooks.(I haven`t in a long time and don`t want to)Or when I look back at them.So saddening.Depressing even...but well things change..times..places..people..maybe its better that i`m back here now?I wonder..and with all this terrorism and at times racial war-fare....I guess its better here man..  Now the next one: Ive been out everyday!Look at my previous entries...ive gone out every single day..and to have fun?Rarely.Much less compared to everyone else.Only lunch with Cheryl and Eugene..Klgcc with Raimie,Syamir and Loong and then the party at Stefan`s place.Never once have I gotten to go to the mall and have fun or watch a movie.I only went for maybe a few minutes on a few occasions to attend to problems with my computer and my printer.and I have yet to go shopping :'( ...Was in Sunway but parents didnt wanna go!And my last Saturday didnt go!Thats why I was so moody as well..sad even..no 1utama or Pyramid..I will NOT GO to Mid Valley to shop these holidays and will try to now these days.Thanks so much Sarah!Made me feel better..lighten up..:D and for everyone out there..Sarah is a special friend to me!Makes me feel better..wuv u hun!  Money Matters: Been spending a bit on drinks at Starbucks..sigh..it`ll never change though.I`m owed rm100..not that its a big deal to me..i`m financially fine for my needs and stuff.  School :? My holiday homework isn`t done...my sej project is in shambles...and not even 1 bit to being done but what to do and how to do is a complete mystery..oh well..I likely fucked my exams..am so gonna get it from my parents..oh well..whats done is done..just hope I can make up for my mistakes..  Friends: Never got to get Sarah that coffee =p..oh well..I guess ill spent her in some way..looks like I wont see Eugene for a while..nice guy..saw Cheryl for the 1st time in 2weeks and bla..Chaman...old friend...been reliving times so similiar to last year..new problems but same people involved..sigh..will things ever change?Screw Raimie the fucking smoker...and to everyone else...hope you enjoyed the holidays...and Mich:Sadly couldnt make it for that coffee..sad..your perhaps the only person (?) that I miss...sigh..And hmm that bickering between Jen,Chaman and Mich..?Could it just fucking end already??!!??I dunno man...  Well my holidays started like perhaps a day earlier cause I didnt go to school on the last Friday of the first school term year:.The night before or Thursday night was at Saturday night fever!that so rocked.Then lunch with cheryl and Eugene...talked alot.and Klgcc with they guys.Those are like my only fun moments in addtition to meeting up Chaman and remembering the old days..yet the same problem still exists..and lets say in more ways than one!  Euro 2004 is starting.I`m up waiting and praying for a game to be telecasted.Its now 3:11am at this point of time and i`m not a single bit tired.Maybe perhaps the night owl right now.Can`t wait to see the matches!I`m so gonna go jump into a cafe or a restaurant showing a game with the guys or whoever wants to!But this is Bangsar...it won`t be quiet (yaay!) and will be packed and seats will be hard to get but lets go for it! :>)!!  Looking back at the moment for now..I guess I can say my holidays are fun or have been fun.And not to many worries..for instance look at Brendan and Wei Ning(Michelle Ren) at Stella Maries have to worry about.Their exams are in like 10 days or so from this very moment as I type.Sure they can take a break and relax but they have to study kinda of course (but so do I but didn`t :p) but they have something immenent to worry about and not be happy...The downside of not exams at the same time as everyone else but later.Same goes for Zhen Cui and the rest of those CHS people I know..exams after holidays..oh so glad i`m in a school that has exams before the holidays.Sadly standards here are high and the questions are tough..the paper formats are forever constantly changing and always cause less time ultimately for a paper and yet plenty for another subject or paper which isn`t so time needin as another.To bad it can`t be added up and donated to a time when you really need it.Anywayz enough on this part of this blogging!Good luck to them in their exams..  Now moving on to something else..looks like cant spike up hair anymore in the morning..hopefully no1 will notice my copper air :p.They didn`t last time or they did or Nikki did and it took 3 or 4weeks.Even people across the canteen were asking ppl who knew me were like "did he dye his hair"..its obvious!Just a pic of me and Chen on rehersal day I belive?My hair had been cut but the front part of my hair still had dye on it and it was so bloody different than the naturally black parts of my hair!Shocking that the prefects were so stoned,blur or just oblivious to it!!  Ive this weird blogging habit now during the holidays!Its just so..wanna blog man!Like the papers say!Online diarys/journals or weblogs or blogs are becoming popular amongst Malaysians.Being one,I say it like lets me let out my feelings,frustrations and what not and emotions and ugh as well let me voice out anything and everything!Look at Mich`s blog.Or its comments.*shrugs* oh well...not everything is perfect..as you can see..ive realised backround music is perhaps rather irritating so ive gotten rid of it unless I can find a sombre mood tune to play...And ive also changed the colours of certain parts of my blog to let it be distinctively different from the other parts and let it be know as the other part of the blog or another section or something thats not just quite related to eachother though they are related to eachother in a way.Damn I need to learn more HTML.Ok dammit my laptops 'H' letter or key is sometimes being a pain in the ass...you think??  Now for a rather touchy subject that I would rather avoid but I just can`t now could I ;)?This entry wouldn`t be complete without it.But this entry will never be complete as said.Now here goes for this:  Well hmm..even Nik`s had a gf before me and he`s like some whack0..heh..but hmm...still something ive yet to experience but happy to leave it alone..though it at times is tearing away at me and memories.I still try to keep my heart burried deep down inside and unable to be accessed from the surface..but more deep down...which means perhaps only people Ive known for a long time and most importantly CLOSELY will be told of whats in that clouded or strangely worked heart of mine.Though they themselves will never find out whats there.Thats for me to know and for you to NOT ever find out.Yes thats right.But it does suck kinda to be lonely and what not..I honestly don`t feel loved.I just don`t!And if I actually think someone does appriciate me,I always feel so paranoid of losing them or doing something which will ultimately end it or something.Yes..thats why in my friendster profile I say i`m paranoid.And to some people,these facts would be like confidential to themselves and trusted ones..although here the whole damn world can view em,I doubt anyone does..and if they do..would they care?Bet not!And care about me or anything??Even bigger NO!Sigh...oh well..i`ll just have to do without this for a long time or forever as it seems to be...Maybe that someone will pop-up one day..oh well..but as who for now perhaps...I aint saying 'who'.  Im having a sandwhich..gonna go down and wash the plate..grab a drink and wash my face,brush my teeth and come back here...its like 3:40am now..  Its Three minutes later.I`m back...but only washed my plate and had a drink..RC Cola in fact..reminds me of Stefans party..over 30 bottles of soda...and mine were the more popular ones!RC Cola baby!And now ive grabbed a York.Its a circular peppermint patty with mint inside.My favourite candy.Asked my dad tog et it for me while he was in the USA almost 3months ago.Yes.It`s a long time ago but hell...its still great :D.At 1st resisting it was a problem..now as time passed and the less and less they were..I could so easily pass like passing up having dinner at a mamak restaurant.Wanted to save some for these holidays to saviour.And save em I have!Still only ate a few during the holidays...sad though..me that is..heheh :'(....  At least my braces are in place and what not.And theres a bright side of things to look foward to...can see my friends when school starts again...will be getting my sunglasses soon..and as for 2moro.or now today.Going out.Have some things to attend to other than a function which I don`t know if i`m going and theres still that faint hope I`m still going shopping!  Wow.Its not 3:50am...im talking to Juan(hmm actually hes left 2 eat =p),Ming (but she aint replied in an hour but not that I care) and Wei Ning...I guess they are just like me..in the same club...sad school is starting and is all sad and depressed and dreading Monday and feel that sleeping on the last available 'fun' hours of the holidays is a waste..Mm this York is good.  And omg!Im missed the beggining of Euro 2004!I said hi to Wei Ning and she said the things on and like "omg!"!Portugal lost 2-1 to Greece!Shocking!And just watched Spains match...they looked good near the end..Valeron scored on the hour mark..1st touch coming on as a substitute!!Omg!Heh.My Pick is still err Italy baby!Oh and thanks so much Wei Ning :D :D :D ..hehehehehe.  an nows it almost 5am...I My Heart Will Go On (Instrumental) By Kenny G is on..over and over..sad eh?But hey!My mood is up!Not so depressed now!Hehehe.Ya think?5 am on the dot!Took three hours on and off for this entry!And don`t worry..nothing suicidal.Theres much more to say but i`m afraid thats personal to all you people out there!Sorry!And it shall forever remain that way..unless something or someone happens and/or comes along hehe.  Luv,  Riz!

        Sigh...its the last considerably 'fun' day left of these holidays..its 1:50am at the moment..and for this entry im gonna say what I did on Saturday 12th June 2004.....  Woke up at 11am which is now becoming a habit for these holidays or will soon be the past holidays..sigh...Didn`t do much today..wanted to go out but mom was sick and bla...and dad was busy sorting out his stuff in his study room..and as for me..my bloody wifi wasnt up during the daytime so I was sadly stuck with N64 and eating,walking around and what not..real sad..really upset...I got invited to see Troy by Rizal like 30mins before it started cause he bought 9 tickets and there was only like 8 of them..but couldn`t or actually didn`t want to cause Eu Git (CCL) Was there..ugh I don`t liek him very much...Rizal`s like he and CCL are the only 2 guys there..if you ask me..there are no guys there!:p ..sigh..Oh well...I would like to see it..not that I would really care if I didn`t..I don`t care much for movies now and never really have..maybe Star Wars is an exception...but other than that..I aint give a damn...everytime I wanna watch one..sure end up forgetting about it and praying Astro will show it again next month..sigh...  So yeah was extremely moody all day...then went to Starbucks....grabbed a Lemon Passion ice-shaken tea...not bad..quite nice..tried calling Mich but I she wasn`t home..guess she wasn`t back yet from Mid Valley..So well called Sarah..talked for half an hour..felt so much better!Wasn`t moody anymore :D love u hun!  ..Then left at like 7pm or so..also dropped by Guardian and got some stuff and got a whopper from BK for dinner...  Wifi came back at 10 pm or so...bathed..chatted and am here..my next entry will be right after this babes!  Riz.

Not much happened during tuition..just did that test paper but dunno if its the actual test.It is the test paper but I didnt have to do it under test like conditions thankfully.:p .Oh my god!That Chee Yong and his twin Chee Seng were like studying history at the end of class when they finished their work and were just waiting for 6pm!Good grief!They are like so bloody hell smart!For the test they got like 50/50!Jeesh.And they were making fun that they are further in the book than the other guy whichever is them and what not.!Blh!Haha..Eugene`s stopped...leaves me as the only guy who doesn`t do work left :p .He`s got some home tuition and like Francis was saying his mom said he`ll be back next year.But he made fun he wants to wait til he`s on par with the twins. :p.lmao.So the thing I got like 5/10 for objective..and finished putting everything into the journals :p .Haven`t put in lejar yet or imbangkan!Oh dear.Hahahahaha.Maybe ill do it at home? :p .Bet not.  So talked with Meng Kwong after school..told him abt 'Velayutham.Keblackan,Ravi and last years 3cekal attendence book.'Muahaha.Damn funny.LMAO LMAO.Damn funny.

      Josh Groban - Per Te  "Per Te"  Sento nell'aria profumo di te Piccoli sogni vissuti con me Ora lo so Non voglio perderti Quella dolcezza così senza età La tua bellezza rivali non ha Il cuore mio vuole soltanto te  Per te, per te, vivrò L'amore vincerà Con te, con te avrò Mille giorni di felicità Mille notti di serenità Farò quello che mi chiederai Andrò sempre dovunque tu andrai Darò tutto l'amore che ho per te  Dimmi che tu già il futuro lo sai Dimmi che questo non finirà mai Senza di te non voglio esistere  Per te, per te, vivrò L'amore vincerà Con te, con te, avrò Mille giorni di felicità Mille notti di serenità Farò quello che mi chiederai Andrò sempre dovunque tu andrai Darò tutto l'amore che ho per te  Non devo dirtelo Ormai già lo sai Che morirei senza di te  Per te, per te, vivrò L'amore vincerà Con te, con te, farò Tutto quello che mi chiederai Andrò sempre dovunque tu andrai Darò tutto l'amore che ho per te  I`ll get the english translation one of these days..

       So went for that thing that Raimie invited me for...ugh that night before I slept at almost 4am..dunno what I was doing..musta gotten lost again in my mind and didn`t realise the time..oh well..thats always happening to me..and it musta really drained me up cause I woke up at like 12pm!Thats the latest ive woken up these holidays!I`m getting worried..Not sticking to my plans of waking up early and what not but my being busy crap is working and what not.  So left home at 1pm.Wee Loong tagged along cause he couldn`t get a ride.Ryan was suppose to come but he was at school for drama practise I think and could`nt make it back before we left..and got there within like twenty minutes of leaving home..not as far away as I thought but it was much futher in than I thought it was...So like called Raimie and he wasn`t there yet!I mean what an idiot!You SHOULD be there at the Venue first before those that you invite to go!Anyway me and Wee Loong walked around the place..woah...exclusive man...walked around the pool...found the bowling alley area and the snooker room and what not..then got onto the roof of some place..weird...anyway we went back to that main hall area and sat and waited for Raimie..Loong like practicly fell asleep waiting and after like half an hour or so finaly Raimie and Syamir came...Syamir was over at Raimies place and what not..  So anyway went down to meet them at the snooker and bowling place and played a game of snooker which took like ages to complete...took ages to get the yellow ball out of the way..good grief and I displayed my true suckiness at pool :p .Heh.Raimie and Syamir all nicely smoking there like they own the place and had chewing gum for cover.Haha.How nice.Loong took a puff but he said it was shitty and obviously I wasn`t even interested in trying a single bit.In fact I was moving away from them to get away from the secondary smoke.Pissheads.I mean what kinda ideas smoke in an air-condition room?/Lol there was also a no smoking area sign.Lmao.Disrespect man!Hahaha.  Then went for lunch at the Café there...so like me and Syamir both had chicken chop while Raimie (yuck girls call him Rai..thats so gay!) and Loong had fish and chips and he orderd chicken wings which soon ended having a fight for it :p.  Then went bowling hahahaha damn screwed up la...Hahah I got 3rd the 1st game and 3rd for the second game with 98!and I started it off with a strike!Ugh!hahaha Raimie who WON THE 1st game!Finished last.haha..Damn I screwed up man..really..I did..Anyway hahaha Raimie changed his name or Syamir did to Natasha and like haha he got strikes in two frames in a row so we wanted him to get one more so the screen would go like 'X triple' haha sick man..Hmm hear he`s been going out everyday of the holidays which is like causing his parents or at least his mom to interogate him all the time on where he`s going and with who..And he and Sue are like on the verge of breaking up?cause its like she wants to wait for her SPM to be over..hmm...anyway like Syamir wasn`t suppose to be there cause he`s been grounded like the whole year cause he had to stay back so much at school for Kadet crap..but Raimie sweet talked his mom into letting him out and when she asked Syamir,"you going with Raimie right?" he was like "umm yeah!"..haha..  Ok soon after that me and Loong left...Damn the Sultan of dunno where was there..red carpet and all laid out man..Damn..who will I see next?1st Sheila Majid then Harith Iskandar ,now the Sultan..now who`s next?Kurt Cobain? Eh no wait he`s dead :p.  Then went home and lepak and then later at like 9:30pm went out to collect my Guess Glasses from the shop and its with new lens and all!Wohoo!Then went TMC and got Milk and Ginger Ale!I love ginger ale..somehow I can`t quite really stand and also like ginger beer..  Okay now I have this add-diction to:   The Used - Blue and Yellow Dj Tiesto - Love Comes Again Josh Groban - Per Te  Wow dammit I really want that new Josh Groban album!It`s really good actually..  According to Brendan Otak Tak Center (A play about 2 ppl with different mental problems that still somehow create a bond within eachother and get along and also shows how mental problem patients are like and what not..)which is at the Panggung Bandaraya on Jalan Raja Laut I think,is quite good...but I dunno..its until the 13th which is like this Sunday..the tickets aren`t that expensive..but I dunno the times and who id go with so looks like I wont be going!Maybe..next time perhaps??  Ok hmm onces again im staying up so late to blog..o dear its the 10th of June already!Thursday!What happened to all the beautiful days of the holidays??Damn ive been so busy and I aint got time to do my website!No!!!!!!But i`m not that unhappy about it but I still wish I could make it..and certainly a few days isn`t enough time to make it..  Anyway I think thats all for now..maybe going to 1 utama today to go shopping and stuff..hehe..ok nite people!Oh yeah I put up a very strong comment of opinion on Michelle`s blog just now which is gonna cause some shockwaves I hope and belive!hehe..its funny though I have to say though some wont find it as humourous as I do!

        Heh.Not bad eh?Come challenge me people!Spent it all on lunch even :P .Heh  So went out for lucn today with Cheryl & Eugene..Originally I may not have gone because perhaps I couldn`t quite bite much yet but hmm Cheryl persued me to go and plus my teeth got better so not?The original plan was like to meet at like 12:30pm but as usuall things don`t quite go according to plan and what not!Heh.I got dropped off at Pelita like at 12:40pm or something like that and still I was the first to get there..Called but both of em were still like on the way here and what not so lepak at MPH la for a while..Then at like 1 something pm I think Eugene got there so anyway we decided just sit inside and not outside cause it was so hot or the lounge..haha Eugene quit Francis cause he has private tuition and he`s like theres a test but I act like ah dunno la!No1 told me!  Then Cheryl came and after taking and ice age of figuring out what to order we got like that deep grilled cheese,some chicken thing which eventually was forgotten abt,a 2 person Paella,some mushroom thing in olive oil and potato wedges in aioli..I later orderd a carrot juice..  So as usual talked and what not...the mushroom thing was good...Eugene was all over the wedges and specially the aioli which i`m not a big off and I definately stayed away from that nasty deep grilled cheese thing!Those guysa re nuts if you ask em for liking such a hideous thing!I mean what is it??Anyways the paellas which take abt 30mins to prepare came and I don`t think they took 30mins though..and I kept threatening eugene and his allergy to prawns and I was the only one who can or at least seems to eat prawns though I find getting the shell of a pain in the neck and it takes forever and sometimes you never get it all off or you get very little meat..Wanted to get salad but nah didn`t..haha...the carrot juice was alright..was thinking abt an Espirit but nah just had one the day before and it costs so much that might as well just spend double or so and get a freshly done drink!Billwas like 110 bucks which isnt that bad..we split it like 30 bucks each I think..ah dunno la I oso dun care heheh..Anyway we were so intent on dessert but decided not to get it there...That what ever thats name ice cream parlour (I think) place at the corner of the street or what used to be Piccolo Mondo closed down..they kept talking abt a place and it turns out that was the place..ill get the name of that place later..heh when passing by only I rememberd the name :p  So went to Alexis for dessert and got cake...I got some chocolate truffle,Cheryl got some cheese cake which she kept thinking there was 'mold' in it but I said blue cheese.Muahaha I AM SO FUNNY!Heh.And we also flipped through em weird magazines and stuff...and heh I was paying for Cheryls tea so I kept pound the leaves and stuff with that super chun tea server thing!If you wanna know,just go to Alexis and order tea!I love tea!haha..ok then Eugene went back at like 3:30pm..hmm bill was 46 bucks which was quite a lot to me but I only had to pay like 20 bucks so I dont have any problems..so we left and went to MPH..  Woah Harith Iskandar was at Alexis just now at the time man!I dont belive Eugene didn`t know who he was or recognise him!Damn thats like the 2nd celebrity ive seen in two days!Who else am I gonna see next?I mean I am going to Klgcc on Wednesday so you never know!  So went to MPH and looked at the cd`s there...bought the new Harry Potter soundtrack cd for Cheryl and gave her,her Saturday Night Fever cd...also got a Father`s day card and double-sided tape...Then Cheryl`s sis came to pick her up so then I walked home at ot home at like 4:05pm..She owes me like a hundred bucks now but I won`t hold it against her really..But still ot like rm70...wanna save some for that thing at Klgcc and like some to pay for a fathers treat if my family goes out for dinner and my bro`s not around..  Was planning to go to 1Utama like after that but it was so hot and maybe a bit lazy so i`ll go another day..now its getting more closer to 4months that I aint shopped in like big ammount!  Oh yeah I dyed my hair brown for no reason the other day cause you know brown isnt so easy to see but I didn`t think it was noticable enough so I dyed it copper again and my hairs still quite short so cant quite see it,but its much lighter than it naturally is and its like certainly gonna show when my hair gets longer...  anyway i`m pathetic ehre,sitting in my room on my laptop on wifi blogging here at like 3am past..damn I need to sleep soon..gotta go for that Klgcc thing at like 1pm and what not so yeah that`s all for now guys!Hope you have a nice day!I certainly did! =)  P/S Jianyau rocks man!

       thats right.  So yeah was gonna go to Mid Valley yesterday..needed to get some things and check out those interior decorating showrooms for my other crib..but went and made like two circles around Mid Valley but all the aprking entrances were like all blocked off cause they were all full...Zones G,H,J I don`t think were full yet..but alotta cars trying to get there so decided nah..So went to Bangsar Shopping Center (BSC) instead..cant wait for the under - construction parts of Mid Valley open..there should be lotsa more parking..but then again more people! *gulp!* .yikes.And there was no traffic jam outside Mid Valley even..though maybe lotsa cars..haha..  Ok went there and checked out Bofi which is fittings for a kitchen.Its nice.Very nice.According to mom one set alone is like rm80000...giler ker...but I have to admit its all very beautiful..so hopefully can get??  Then went for lunch...got some Singapore Yee Mee which wasnt bad but can tahan la..got Espirit..hadnt had in ages..its more expensive than I thought! rm6.80!haha but I charged it all to dad so no probs =D .LoL.  Saw Sheila Majid like outside Guardian...Shein is right..she is Sheila Majid`s height!I didn`t belive it at first actually!And she looks so different..not as glamourous or as fair as she is when she`s performing but of course that`s normal isn`t it?Who wants a legion on fans mobbing you while your at the mall?Hey everyone`s human!

       Get the picture from the title?  Ok my day started at like 11 a.m which is like the latest time ive gotten up at these holidays so far!Yikes!Alarming!So I was rushing to get ready and bla cause Connie and Oscar was coming over to do our dumb and screwed up sejarah project which is like Chapter 10 of the syllabus which is err Dasar British dan Kesannya Terhadap Ekonomi Negara..  So Oscar came at like 12pm and we were just lazing around waiting for Constance to come and like turned on music on my laptop and cause the dining table in the front was like didn`t have a stable surface the sound was all screwed up so like Linkin Park - Numb was like going at like /2 according to him which caused him to laugh like a jackass...bloody bastard!And so were all the other songs like Incubus..bloody hell..So moved everything to the main dining table in the dining room..Then finally all the sound was alright!  After waiting for abt 5 ice ages or so Cons came at like 12:50pm!So late...errgh..Haha..she brought her laptop and we started typing up stuff...she was relatively quick on her assignment cause I was like slow in mine cause I had to birng down my radio for them and what now..get sodas for her and go get reference stuff and Adobe Photoshope Deluxe to install on her laptop I think..then after a while the fan blew my sejarah text book`s inside of the back cover with all the stuff needed to be in the scrap book and we realised it was all wrong and I kena in the from Cons..haha so in the end we got lazy and hooked up the internet to our laptops and started having fun hehe..  Took down a microphone which worked well on my laptop but didnt function onCons laptop so we started having fun with it and then Kok Yoong was online!Hehehehe damn funny la...under Cons`s email we started messaging him and he seemed to get pissed off and like Cons then said me and Oscar was here so he was like at 1st wondering why Cons so vulgar...we started insulting hima nd what not..damn fun la!To bad didn`t save the convo!So bloody damn funny...we started taking turns insulting him and like mainly it was that Oscar talking and mocking him with 'Chee Kok Face' 'CB' and more..hehehehe damn funny la...Oh yeah and Cons visited my blog and read the part which I have about her and she was gonna kill me so I ran away and started screaming like some amd dickhead..haha my parents were out so we were noisy like crap..haha OScar was more interested in sleeping instead and bla...  And then Cons started playing around with ym phone,call ppl la and bla and then she asked for more covers and started drawing some new one`s which are pretty nice so if you see my handphone cover and see that its very gay then it`s not my fault!  Then OScar went back at 3pm and soon my parents came home then got ready to go to Vinod`s party or the party for Vinod at Stefan`s hse...dad sent us...it was pot-luck so like I brought 3bottles of RC Cola...  So met alotta ppl there and what not,Nicola,Nishanti,Sithira,Ash& Chong,Ting,Nick,Zyl,Shameer Ali and Abu,U-Waye and lots more la...ok so Cons was a bit bored there and like she and Div taught me how to play cho tai ti which yes I sound like a loser only learning how to play now..U-Waye taught me a few years ago but he explain like 1 dumb guy only...and like 3 or4 guy got beaten by a girl...terrible...then soon Cons went back at 5pm and she went back to ym place to pick up her laptop..but left her books for me to type up stuff in a summary form and bla..so called mom and aske dher to open the gate for her and bla...  Then Sashya came and stuff...played ISS I think on pS2 in Stefan`s room...damn fun..I played Dinni like Brazil vs Italy and it eventually became like 10men on 7 cause I miss timed all my tackles and soon I had to be careful cause one more red card and I lose on forfeit!Damn!I missed a great chance with Vieri but I made the shot to powerful and almost gave away a few penalties...I was desperately defending and stuff and like Dinni imself like messed up like a truckload of chances to put it away and I held out til a penalty shoot-out even!I scored the 1st but Dinii missed but in the end he won 4-3 cause I missed the last penalty!Damn damn damn..!Just move the control stick a little bit oso can go wide arr...pundek betul hahaha but it was dman fun la....I was gonna play Navin but though I wasnt gonna be around by then..and then after that we sang happy birthdya to vinod though his b-day was like during the exams time and Stef insisted they celebrate..hahaha I started losing my voice b4 so I was at the top of my voice singing..haha..  Hahaha I was suppose to leave at 6pm but didnt hehe...just said I was goin back later haha...So soon more and more ppl left and soon like me,Abu,Stef,Sash,Navin and also Karl which he left after a while thankfully!We talked alot abt stuff cartoons and alot..damn nice..haha ate the dessert Navin made...its some hideous but not bad whip cream thing with those canned soup fruit stuff..which turns out that Navin made several improvisions which lead to me making funny remarks abt it..haha...damn it was fun there..turns out everyone else was still in the room playing ISS haha..  So then like went back with Abu..which had me him,Ali and Lam crammed in the back..damn Abu`s Perdana`s pick up and bump handling and general is better than mine..dammit..so sent back Lam 1st to Bangsar Park..damn he looked different..haha all formal shirt tucking in haha..hes a nice guy turns out..I used to think he was like those typical chinese morons but he`s not..also found out that Rai smokes..I heard earlier but this time its confirmed..bloody guy..Also Aizyl has moved to Kota Kemuning and and is like schooling there now...he and Ryan left a lil early cause they were attending some Yamaha Concert at the Putra World Trade Center or PWTC which was featuring some Japanese guy I think according to them...and then like Abu`s dad was going around with a pretty muc empty tank of fuel!The light was already on so had to stop at Mobile to get the gas and like rm50 only made the tank go up to like just above the three quarters full mark..a full is like rm70 or rm75 I belive liek when I 1st got mine..damn that car can load up on fuel like madman!Then finaly got home at like 8:45 pm or so and like mom and dad werent home cause they went to Klang for some wedding..so I just ate swiss rolls and stuff and lepak online and stuff and slept at like 2am as usuall!  And haha my camera has like only 9pics but some are funny hahaha so yeah I gotta go now man!Irs Sunday afternoon as im typing this and like gonna go out..Ive gone out everyday so far these holidays..damn no time to do the damn website!Got more stoner pics!Hehe..haha Navin was like asking forever whats a stoenr..we originally said him but U-Waye said eh wait hes a stoner and saying a stoner is Navin is an insult!Haha..Damn now I ahve this crazy blogging madness crave which is why now all my entries are gonna be long like crap like this entry!Before I was lazy and used to type short summarized entries but now i`m writing everything down!I love my blog!Been reading alot in the papers now abt Malaysians and blogs..for us its like a way to express ourselves since we'are quiet at times in class'..to me its like expressing myself and what I do and like my life as a teenage freak..you know..  Dman gotta catch up movies..heard the new Harry Potter sucked from Ashley..not like i`d go anwyay unless someone paid for my ticket!Damn last I watched was Scooby-Doo2 and like Sashh says The Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen is good so I dunno la!Damn this is like gonna rank amongst my longest bloggings!Damn this day was fun!So this pretty much wraps up 5TH JUNE 2004!!  So yeah as I said thats all for now although when I actually said it,it was like so many bloody lines ago!so yeah bye-bye and have a nice weekend y`all!  As usuall,  Riz.

       Yeah great aint it?  Ok I woke up at like 9am on FRIDAY 4TH JUNE 2004...Ran some laundry and what not..didnt do much..Then met Redz,Shaz and Faris at the Mosque and haha we were like talking abt how Nik was gonna survive in Japan..haha it was funny..making jokes such as 'the guest has to wash the dishes' and you know..stuff...hehehe..  Then went home and just lazed around as usual cause I had Acc later at 4:30pm and I went and like the 1st door opened cause it obviously wasn`t locked so the upstairs room at the Bangsar Gospel Center can be accessed but like the door leading to the hall where like the tuition is like was like locked and it was all dark! So I was like wtf??Not tuition?? Cause like GB said yesterday there was tuition like normal..maybe she got my question wrongly but I think I coulda figured it out myself on common sense but oh well..hahaha..  So I like called Chaman and we had drinks at SFC which I hardly go..but like Coffee Bean is like I dont go often but you know..had quite often previously and the same with Starbucks Coffee..I err had a Lemon-Lime Teez Freez which was very nice..and it was surprisingly brown in colour but tea pretty much is but still thosr thingies are yellow and green...we talked alot abt how things are and other general stuff..found out why some ppl left Smbb Like Gagan who`s dad was uncomfortable with the part alotta ppl think he was a gangster and ppl made jokes abt it to Gagan..I mean his dad does have tattoos and bla but like hes a nice guy I hear..a paramedic even more..so anyway was able to have a drink and bla without even having to go out on that excuse!My mom though I had tuition so why not just stay and lepak?Maybe now I can go for drinks more often and not like get scolded or not allowed out!But ive gone out everyday these holidays man..haven`t really been quite like at home all day unless Wenesday which was kinda shitty cause the braces were hurting...  And Bangsar isnt so safe now man..like Ryan got robbed..although its scayr but afterwards is damn funny..Chaman got an sms from Ryans moms phone and like he said something and asked  2 talk in Malay and was like sapa kamu?Saya perompak.Saya baru tadi rompak member kamu Ryan Lee( LMAO!I was getting ppl staring at me cause I was laughing so loud!) so like he said..saya kesian dia tadi kerana dia nak dia punya IC balik..then the sms`s stopped cause it turns out Ryan only had 1bar...turns out he was walked back from U-Waye`s hse at night and along Jalan Terasek 6 or something he got cornerd against a car by these guys on a motorbike and almost got slashed..he almost ran away but tripped and hurt himself badly and like those guys tripped over im and the knife almost fell on him but like he pleaded for his IC back and bla but dunno la..theres more to this which im a little lazy to type despite the fact I have this mad blogging craze which`ll mean i`ll only make my next entry though a day late like a day late again..oh I dunno im crapping now...heh..just ask me if you wanna know the whole story so in conlussion Bangsar is no longer a safe place anymore!Yikes!  Riz.

        Ok im so getting sunglasses now man!  Ok my morning like started at 8:30am..I got up early as usual or had to a matter of fact..cause had to go like to the eye doctor..but not the regular one..  So ok Dr Tee like made recommended me to Tun Hussein Onn cause she couldnt find anything wrong with my eyes although shes not an eye specialist...  So went there at 9am..the 1st ever time you go its walk in and like those who have appointments which must mean the second time theyve been is like they get more priority...So had to register my name and bla and they had to make some file on me..And fortunately it didnt take that long but that wasnt the long part..  The long part was waiting!Omg what took so bloody long was when they were calling to check my glasses power...jeesh...they like give priority to those whove got appointments and they got called much later than I did!Omg was waiting for ages!Finaly they called me for something which in the end took like 10 minutes cause they also tested my eye and bla..  Then finally got to meet the doctor and after a series of questions and tests he said there was nothing wrong with my eyes and he said if I my problem repeats then I should see a neurosurgoen or a neurologist or something like that..Oh yeah my problem is that I seem to be getting headaches which seems to start throbbing and coming from behind my left eye..the doc said maybe its plaster( i think) headaches or migrains...I wonder..It doesn`t happen to often..maybe every  once or twice a week every like few weeks...Ive noticed that they happen on Thursday afternoon..at almost the same times..gosh..scary..wonder what could it be..  So then went back and slept a bit to get the pain away from my mouth cause I partly as well didnt take the pain killer :p ....  Then went out and had a haircut..it was actually longer originally but I wnated it shorter which im regretting a bit cause its kinda short although not to short although my hairs reminding me of Nizam`s hair..haha..Then went Mega optics my usual optical shop and like got a new pair of lens made for my glasses (used the same frame..yes those Guess frames that Kim Fui said to give him if I didnt wnat em :p..shows they are nice! and not cheap as well!)So ok im using my spare glasses or the ones I was using before I made the Guess pair which were originally a spare but then I realised rimless is nicer...oh yeah making new lenses cause theres like some cracks on the connections on em...so yeah need to get that done and then getting sunglasses baby!Getting these Killerloops which are like also under the same company as Ray-Ban..getting power for em and bla and mercury so you can`t see my eyes from the outside of em..Cool huh!?Its like an orange frame and the lenses are gonna be like err orangy or is it greyish?haha Ive forgotten...gotta power for em or else i`ll be blind with em!Ok then went TMC and got a truckload of stuff..  Ok didnt do much else but blog..  Oh yeah got some gathering invite from Raimie at KLGCC on the 9th which is this Wenesday I belive..  Ok thats all man..night night!I`ll shall write Fridays post after this or later whenever im free..laters..  Riz.

      Heh.Not bad eh?  Well yeah the title is the part of me now having braces...I used to have em a long time ago but then swtiched to a retainer but soon my jaw was the problem..My bottom jaw was like longer than the upper jaw so thats why theres  a problem and also the reason why my face is long..  So went to the dentist at like 12pm...and like hmm haha found out my dentist is an Arsenal fan...it took like an hour or so to get it over with..he asked what colour I wnated and I like choose the darkest shade of black that there was so yeah..hahaha it looks scary to some extent...  So I gotta take this pain killer like everyday for like 3days..and like err my teeth are like super weak..I gotta use a plastic spoon to eat and bla..but in a week or so it should be all right so I can eat solids again!Im sick of this liquids diet..its terrible..Oh well...at least I can eat ice cream like mad and my parents not saying anything about it!

Tuesday:  My Packard Bell desktop was ready to pick-up at Mid Valley...So went and got the latest version of Microsoft Word as well which is err 2003 I think..so went home and put the computer back together but like all the original files were like all gone!But according to the guy who fixed my comp (Yusri),He said all my files were under the administrator username so had to and retrieve everything from there...but gotta reinstall most of my programs to I think like Word,Norton and what not...So I guess we`ll see how it goes...Im not quite sure how to do it so i`ll just leave all the stuff to dad..  Ok so finaly got a new Car! Toyota Vios!Damn chun man...the guy came and took the Wira away which was for trade in.A little sad seeing it goes cause like...when I came from the USA the car was like bigger thna my car which was a Geo Prism..Its like Wira shaped but like the auto version of a Wira 1.3 which was made by Chevrolet and Toyota pretty much so it was a good car..small enough for the 4 of us there so thats why got it..so it was like damn cool to come back and be in a much almost bigger car...it always seemed different to me when I 1st came in 1995 and for good in 1997..I guess it was cause I was young and was still in awe..heh..hmm its a 1.6 so got it off for rm16000...the guys like from Taiping and Assam Kumbang even!So could highly see the car there!All he has to do is just do some works on the car and he can easily sell it for 20000+ cause the cars still in good condition...So then went over to the Toyota Showroom in Bangsar..so picked up the car...damn those guys are like really into making good impressions and bla..the guy was like polishing the car still even on little little waterspots just before got the car!Its quite nice la...the cd players thankfully in the car but only 1 disc but its alright...And the boot needs to be slammed shut to close it..so gonna have to sent it for fixing as its still under warranty so why pay to have it done?But the nearest place is like section 19 so hmm have to do it on a weekend..  Ok then went to the Canon Office in Subang near the old Subang Airport to see abt the printer..and ugh...its costing like rm400 to fix!My god!They say the printer head is busted as well as the paper feeder or maybe the high price is intentional cause they dont wanna really repair things and are interested in selling new items which is less hassle and can save them time and money and get even more money..damn..So just traded it in for some Canon i560 Bubble Jet printer...the old printer trade in was worth like rm150 so paid like rm450 or so to get the printer...should be better cause its much newer than my old one which is like a S600 bubble jet printer which claims to be the fastest in its line but it was a lie I say!My god...when my dad prints stuff for stock market..it takes ages!  I was able to get all that stuff done cause Connie couldnt come over to do the sejarah project..looks like we`ll have to do it another day...Mom made spaghetti!yay!yum yum yum!  Ok so then later than evening,went by Nicola`s place and got the my cd from her and what not..talked a bit...Thats all..woah the walk all the way up Jalan Ara was like super tiring but its ok..I need to get my ass back in shape..then on the way home walking up Jalan Terasek I like met Chow Di who was jogging down the street like some madman cause he said he was going over to Nik`s house to get his brother...like whats up with that man...cant he walk back on his own or something?Weird...haha..  So I guess thats it for this entry and bla for Tuesday 1st June though its like 4days late!Will write the rest later for the following days!  Riz.

After all my usuall 'my fmaily never leaves on time',we left at like err quarter to 1 o`clock..kinda late aint it?Well 1st thing on the agenda was to attend the wedding of my daD`S cousin or something whose son or daughter..entah was getting married..He was the only relative my dad had from so up North that came down to KL for my bro`s wedding in 2001...so the wedding was in Ipoh somewhere..was wearing my Blue-neonish pretty mucn 2toned blue long sleeve shirt..loved it man..damn nice and comfortable..so we got there late 3:15pm only..by then they were all cleaning up..but theres like a park with some land in front of their hse so they had the places for sitting and all there and a normal canopy in front of their House...So since evryone had left,pretty much the host (my dads cousin)was entertaining us..and so were some relatives..damn!I true mixture and mixing around of weird accents from Kedah,Penang,Perak...turns out with the Perak accent, 'awak' actually means 'I' or 'myself'..strange man..my parents can make the accent but not talk like mad in them cause they havent stayed in Perak for ages...So left there at like 4pm cause it was drizzling and was gonna rain soon..  So was planning to stay overnight at the Royal Casuarina but mom wanted to stay in Kuala Kangsar so just went through the rain which was slowwing anyway to Kuala Kangsra and got the very last room at the Resort Safari Sungai Perak..2 1/2 star place..ok la for 1night...nice view of the Sungai Perak at the Bridge to Sayong..hahaha luckily brought some towels cause they said tuala habis and we were joking abt katil habis and haha they gave a normal tilam for the floor which they charge 20rm hahaha!Hahaha its like tilam memang habis..hahah food ok lar..not special or anything...ate quite alot but nothing special..  So in the morning had breakfast which for me wasnt nice..dont know how you ppl (Malaysians who are like this(read on) )can eat Nasi or mee for breakfast!Gawd!I still haven`t gotten used to that kind of thing..And haha had like 4cups of tea and 1 of coffee..watch it Steffi..i`m getting closer to you and your over caffeiness!

So went on to Taiping and like met the real estate agents to like look at the house and value it so they will when they can..gave them a keyset..Wanted to go to my grandma`s hse there but the lady who comes by and jaga the house had balik kampung so couldnt but was able to eat at Yut Sun!Damn long neevr eat there..damn nice..everytime there ah..its closed cause they close at 7pm and arent open on Sundays..useless!So had nasi goreng with inchiban or something chicken..damn nice..crispy..oily almost hehe..  So went back to KK and finalized the hse there and went back to Kuala Lumpur..got home at like 9pm..shit on my way there  to KK ate up 1whole role of mentos..grape..yikes!Sugar content madness and then an apple on the way back!oH dear!  So then unpacked the damn car and like went to Mahbub for dinner..had the usually Naan and tandoori there...ah nice and hot..very nice..then went home and bla and here I am...got a busy day 2moro or actually today now which is Tuesday 1june!Hello June!tralalaaalala...hmm Oscar cant make it 2moro for the Sej project so only Connie (Constance) will be coming over to do the project..likely we`ll ahve to take 2 or3days and do tomorow(2day)and sambung balik next week when Oscar can finaly get a ride cause his moms in Alor Setar and all...

      Hahaha  Saturday was kinda boring..not much really to do..Sarah did something to make her dad angry so couldnt make it for cofee..this Sat I assume or so that we`ll make it..dunno la...  Then like went to Mid Valley for a while..gave the Windows Recovery diskette to Yusri,the uy who`s fixing up my desktop...he says that the hardware seems to be fine..its just that the software is a bit screwd perhaps,so he`s re-installing windows..So gave the computer passwords to him so he could copy the files cause all will be lost of you use the recovery diskette just like that and stuff..I hope only the software is screwed...but it was long due for fixing up soon anyway..so nothing much else for me to say about this subject...  Then went to Pelita for dinner...had err naan & tandoori..not bad..maybe the naan wasnt that nice but boleh tahan la..Woah man..Porto wei on fire man...Carlos Alberto..Deco!,Alenitchev..shit man..my Porto choice team is more like...Baia,Valente,Jorge Costa,Ricardo Carvalho,then Dmitry Alenitchev,Costinha,DEco!,Maniche,McCarthy,Jankaukas and ewrr who eh ah..Ah!Paolo Ferreira..only Jankaukas isnt a regular..just dont like Derlei much...

Then made like 3 eggs into scrambbled eggs for breakfast/lunch....and watched the 1st half of the Asia Cup 1st Quarterfinal which featured Bahrain vs Uzbekistan which was a good game...heard it finished 2-2 and Bahrain won on penalties...  Parents not home...so music`s on loud...  And i`m not at CHS attending that 4-way Installation Day...there`s no need for me to be there I feel.  I have homework to catch up.

      &nbsp;Err well nothing notable in school happened...didn`t need to do my BM presentation because it would take up too much time during BM and appearently aint got enough BM time to teach these days or according so by my BM teacher...Anyway for BM lisan my topic is 'Jenis-jenis permainan tradisional di Malaysia'...so simple!Can copy and paste all the way :D :D :D..haha...  Well as you know, referring to the entry below, I have lotsa&nbsp;craploads worth of&nbsp;homework to do..  But now ive done my Commerce work and the nastiest parts of BM which was to make sure my Karangan 1 and 2 book was updated by copying the stuff in Divyesh`s book..heheh...I shall do Chemistry Peka later...Econs later..Accounts can go fuck off. English isn`t much and perhaps i`ll do it later before I go to bed but I need to be sure of the work...cause last time I answered all the questions for this&nbsp;1 story when I needed to do only maybe 7 outta the 14 I did...aahahaah..rajin at least right hehe ;P  Well anyway ive planned to wake up at 6:30am and work out on the exercise bike and on the abs sculptor and then jog about 20 or 30 laps around the BSC field which isn`t very big comapred to the field at my school. I tried dragging Ryan along but he wanted to sleep instead :p...If I can get a handball sized ball soon, i`ll go and practise my shots and stuff :P...hehe...i`m so outta shape, lacking fitness and weak now...my muslces are losing its strength..and my abs aint at packed as they were though they werent really..haha..  Not going for the ICC Interact Installment crap which has the Installation day of CHS,BBBS,Samad and La Salle PJ which is at CHS which is likely gonna attract people by the truckloads..sorry Zhen! But congrats to  urlLink Zhen Cui  for being err president now I belive of the CHS Interact Club!haha...  oh yeah Afandi so damn fucking stoned didn`t see the oversized and overage written next to his name on the school futsal tournament forms!What an idiot...Shahril wrote it of course..haha...next time must write overweight..haha..  Anyway Ive dropped the idea of buying black trousers...looks like gotta wear uniform..maybe i`ll wear those green trousers I used when I need some pants of some sort to improvise the time at the beggining of the school year when I didn`t have the schools official pant trousers crap ready..just maybe..or maybe i`ll just wear my school pants in the end :p.  No tuition today..went on Tuesday what..hehe...  Anyway thats all for tonight I belive. Have a great ya`ll!

       Ok so this is a short list of things I wish to have..it`s lesser now since I got my thumb drive the other day...  &nbsp;   A pair of black trousers...I have one but they are rather tight and would be nicer if an inch longer...I wanna wear them at Commencements and I don`t give a damn about if I have to wear school pants at the show...my ass is available for kissing to those who would be against this.   My desktop computer`s problems to end..  Haziqah`s blog address...I know you`ll be reading this...you just wait!  I think I wanna get a haircut soon...I think..?  Some snacks!  Try and get back my wifi..though my method is rather risky...  $$$$$$$$$$$$$  Study...exams are on the 9th of August..  Start working out again and train for handball...im so out of favour and by the way, i`m so weak and have no speed to speak of when running and stamina that I need to hop my yella ass on the exercise bike and start cycling and pushing...Those Abs need work as well.   That list was totally useless and jobless!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; =0 !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.!  School consisted of nothing but hardly anyone in class. Appearently Rachel`s birthday party was last night and Aaron & co. went and didn`t come to school...relatively peaceful today...Well anyway school was a bore..accounts is turning into a blackhole for me...and yes I slept in Agama class just now.Heh.  After school I had a dentist appointment and I hear I need a few teeth extracted =0! Yikes...anyway my teeth hurt now...there`s now more brackets on the back teeth and stuff..pretty much like having a ring for all of them back there now. Anyway there was some Listerine cheap-0 price promo and like I ave 3 big bottles of Listerine and like 6 or 8 small bottles and 3 pocket pack mints. Yay!  Then went by err whats that place called...ahh SmartConneXtion in Bangsar..that new clothes shop..like some Giodano copy if you ask me..heh..anyway there was a 30% sale there so got some shirts..heh..and my original purpose was to look for black trousers.haha. got a  Maroon V-Neck   and a   navy blue shirt.   Also got a grey coloured t-shirt since if I spent another rm20, i`d get a free unbrella. Haha..Not that thers none at home but why not :p...   Well I was a good boy when I went home and finished up all my homework..and oh dear!look at the time! its 10:30pm...sounds perfect for catching lots of sleeping time!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding to the part about this entry which has something to do with the title, i`ll give some info on what happened in school today.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the class got back it`s Chemistry PEKA papers and appearently everyone did their`s wrongly...yikes..and those Kementerian fellas could be coming next week!Die! We then did what&nbsp;Mrs. Kalai&nbsp;called the easiest experiment around! Not so simple! No-one exaclty knew what to do and in the end she told everyone to stop cause everyone was doing something wrong. She listed out the mistakes of everyone ranging from having books on the tables, chairs all over, wrong handling of the Bunsen burner and crap...and more...lucky she didn`t write me and Zainul`s name`s down although we turned off the Bunsen burner wrongly...fortunately she didn`t see...but alot of other people kena..who know`s whats she`s gonna do...Crazy...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sejarah test postponed to next week since hardly anyone in school because of Commencements practises and rehersals and crap. During computer class, most guys were asleep or dozing off as Mr. Ashwin was boringly explaining what he was teaching on Adobe Photoshop...yawn..I dozed off several times..Au Yong was the best and stuff...head on the table..sleep!Haha..  Then went home pretty fast...changed and went to Mid Valley to send my desktop for repair...it has problems starting up and booting...now it looks like that the Windows XP is the problem and Yusri is suggesting that the computer should be rolled back to Windows 98 rather than XP, but I had little problems with Windows 2000 Professional and sutff...so maybe i`ll give him a call and tell him..Sadly all the files on it could be gone :(((( And I didn`t make any copies!!!!But he said he`ll do whatever he can to try and save them..Well anyway I got this 128mb thumb drive just now which is extremely small and thin :-) ...also got&nbsp;10cd-rw`s and 25 cd-r`s and stuff...not that they are needed very often but are handy to have around if needed and plus I`m pretty much out of them anyway..Anyway got home from there at 5 pm and ate lunch...  Then did question 12 only of my accounts homework..and anyway went for tuition at 6:25pm...heh late by only 10 minutes!Not bad eh?Anyway met Dharmik there and I amazingly sat in front for once..those twins were at the back with their weird nerd like friends as well although the whole class turned around when one of them mentioned something about his pant`s falling off.Haha.Yuck.Heh. Anyway towards the end of tuition, everyone was tired and stuff and got lost.haha...  Anyway class ended at like 7:45 pm which is should actually!Haha! Anyway waved at Kar Leng and Ben earlier before class,&nbsp; Jahiliyah fortunately was not there and Mughni looked like a gay according to Divyesh. Wow I need to see that. I`ll likely then go buy his waredrobe. Haha.  Anyway after that went to MPH looking for another Ledger Book cause I forgot to while at MPH Mid Valley where I got a g2,g1 refil and a testpad.Yikes..they didnt have any...Bastards..I have an emtpy one, but save it for school since they say I need 2....well anyway tuition wont be until Friday next week so no worries =) . Then went by 7-11 and bought some breadstuff and a Kofta and Large Fries on take out at BK. Then mom picked me up near Pelita.  Anyway I got some school accounts work to do. In addition to that, I need to bathe :p . Toodles.

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah! The title says it all babes...today yielded perhaps one of the shortest ever assembles in history...ya think? All they did was sing Negaraku and the School song and just announce the names of those that were getting awards on the Commencement`s day...but most awards are to be awarded in the morning awards giving ceremony and crap and some at night during the dinner show. Anyway finaly they gave  Cheryl   some&nbsp;award  of some sort  for fencing  and stuff.... They didn`t give anything last time to those who took part in Sukma just cause she didn`t win anything of fare very well...Losuy school..Haha...Okay yikes! Must wear formal attire for the Show! I was so planning what tow ear...fine i`ll wear the Blazer...but I refuse to wear school pants! I shall wear black trousers like I originally planned to! Heh. I hope so about my shirt choice as well. But i`m definately bringing my camera and taking photos like crap. I promise that I truly will take lots of photos! Mark my words you lousy biatches!    &nbsp;  English was funny with Afandi and stuff being scolded like crap and stuff...Heheh.. Mrs. Rama was asking "Who`s Inky?" cause he wrote down 'Inky' on his paper that he and Farouq did. By the way the assignment was to write a summart on the poem we did today which was 'There`s Been a Death In the Opposite House (I think) by Emily Dickinson. Me and Shahril`s paper was the best.&nbsp; Only   three   mistakes! Haha! So she didn`t call us and start scolding us and rapping about anything! We rule.      &nbsp;  Well for some weird reason, the computer (my Packard Bell desktop, not my laptop) has problems connected to the internet when it was fine last week....so brought it to Yusri at Mid Valley who took out the old modem and said it was probably fried...so he sold us an Aztech USB modem which is so cute :-)!!!! So small! You can just slit it into your pocket and stuff! So compact and portable. He even installed it for me and saved me the trouble of having to. Heheh. It cost rm150 since I`m becoming a 'regular customer'. Lol. Damn modern technology!    &nbsp;  So then Tok Su Arif and his wife and Kassim who looks like some Arab kinda guy since his mom`s English and stuff...Think he`s an accountant. So while mom was getting ready refreshments and stuff, I sat down and chatted with them and basically entertained them! They came anyway by the way, to visit my grandma..and she seems to talk alot and smile when relatives and stuff are around which is good. Heh. Found out alot of stuff from em. And they also learned quite a bit from. I`m so different from my brothers. They are relatively quiet and stuff and think a bit. I`m more sponteneous and louder and more talkative! Finally I can make some good use outta all that 'talent' of mine ;p.    &nbsp;  So after they left and stuff at 7 pm, hooked the computer back up and stuff...wiped up all the dust around there and seperated the wires as bets as I could so only the power system wires and the sound system wires will maybe perhaps get tangled up a bit...but things still not co-operating with me. Firstly I belive the system was unstable cause of all that assembling and when it finally started up, the screen and its colours were all screwed up so i`ll have to see about it..    &nbsp;  Anyway I`m going for Francis acc class 2moro....got some undone work..cia0loz!

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well  yesterday  evening, I decided to study for the Sejarah test on Tuesday. Chapter is 8 is coming out...oh dear...haven`t paid much attention is class these days or the last few months i`ll bet. Last test on chapter 7, I got away with not studying and got a  66 . Not bad considering I didn`t think I could do that well in my book.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So mom and dad were still away outta town, so there was a nice spot in the driveway to sit..I made iced tea with my Crabtree & Evelyn teabags...I think i`ll use cheaper teabags next time..1 1/2 - 2 cups takes up the whole bag pretty much!I think it`s alot although it`s likely measured up as the same ammount in total if I put it in&nbsp; a mug :p . So I put my tea on the Vios. Haha..Then grabbed a deckchair and put it in a nice spot under the shade and stuff...Since it was so bright out there, I took my sunglasses and wore them while reading...and yes the words could be seen properly...Quite productive...was able to study from 4:30pm-6pm..then kacau Sarah :p..    &nbsp;  Well after that I washed the Vios up and stuff...used the car shampoo and not detergent like I did on the old Wira when no one cared. Haha.I did it myself cause the cars like is not even 2 months old so didn`t want the maid to bust the car up or something..anyway had to move the car back a bit anyway and bring up the windows so better suited for me to do. Damn now got  lotsa  mosquito bites from all that outdoor-ness! Hehe!    &nbsp;  Well mom and dad finaly came home at 9pm...thank god I didn`t follow them..they musta did so much work and stuff cause they brought back so much stuff til the car was full....heh...if that brought that ammount of stuff back and I was around, I wouldn`t have anywhere to sit. Well after unloading the car and stuff, got Nasi Goreng Ayam from Darul Ehsan for dinner...I had 1 1/2 packets worth of food...the food was nice though the portions were much less than usuall!   Then I started printing out stuff for people like the maths work for Cons and Farouq`s OET2...Then slept at around about 12am something.

      There's a place off Ocean Avenue  Where I used to sit and talk with you  We were both 16  And it felt so right  Sleeping all day, staying up all night  Staying up all night   There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet  We were both 18  And it felt so right  Sleeping all day, staying up all night  Staying up all night   If I could find you now  Things would get better  We would leave this town  And run forever  Let your waves crash down on me  And take me away, yea   Theres a piece of you that's here with me  Its everywhere I go  It's everything I see  When I sleep  I dream and it gets me by  I can make believe that you're here tonight  That you're here tonight   If I could find you now  Things would get better  We would leave this town  And run forever  I know some where, some how  We'll be together  Let your waves crash down on me  And take me away, yea   I remember that look in your eyes  When I told you this was good bye  You were begging me not tonight  Not here  Not now   When looking up at the same night sky  And keep pretending the sun will not rise  We'll be together for one more night  Some where  Some how   If I could find you now  Things would get better  We would leave this town  And run forever  I know some where, some how  We'll be together  Let your waves crash down on me  And take me away, yea   I just  love  this song!!! Do you??

      &nbsp; Damn the price differences between the two place is huge! Two drinks at Starbucks&nbsp; can cost like rm20++ while Mamak is like err anything from 2 - 4 bucks for two drinks!Insane!But well..thats the price you pay for higher quality stuff and perhaps some class and stuff...haha..    &nbsp;  Woke up pretty early..at around about 8:20 am.spent the next 3 or 4 hours helping mom & dad get ready to go to Ipoh. So in the end they left at about like 12pm so yay!I`m all free!Got the house to myself pretty much...can cause all the havoc I want and go out whenever!Sadly  urlLink Cheryl  wasn`t free so couldn`t go for Paella or something..and Sarah was at a family gathering so no coffee for her!Tried getting  urlLink Michelle &nbsp;to go for that long lost coffee we wanted to get and stuff...but she was to busy with her Chemistry work and stuff which is well too bad..looks like wont be able to get that drink for another month i`ll bet with how my weekends are shaping up unless....    &nbsp;  So called up my old budddy Chaman and we could re-live our glory days or triumph such as last year with all these personal issues. Well he tried calling Mich again and she asked her mom but she couldn`t so there went any chances of her getting to call Jennifer to come or something.Didn`t wanna call  urlLink ZA  cause then there would be a difficulty in talking about rather sensitive issues and subjects.    &nbsp;  So we met up at Starbucks at 4:30 pm or so..Appearently my Starbucks card is all full up so I can redeem now!Actually coulda just now but decided nah...Well anyway I had a Green Tea Frap. I never really liked green tea before this =) . Well we talked about how Smbb was, how Michelle doesn`t deserve a looker such as Rizal or ZA who seems to have something for Joanna?YUCK!!!!!!!!!!THE THOUGHT OF HER CAN MAKE ME PUKE!!!! Also on how Permesh dumped Temmengung and joined Syahbandar so he could get glory and with Syahbandar in the end sweeping up all the events.WTF. No wonder why Jia Liang was so proud of himself leading them to glory and crap. Lotta other stuff mentioned as well.    &nbsp;  Then at like 7pm we got up to ciao but instead kept talking and at 7:30 pm decided to go to Pelita for drinks. rm3 only for 2 drinks! I belanja :p. hahaha..had air limau ais and then started dissing Eu Git. Need to give his phone number to all sorts of characters and stuff...teach that whore a lesson.    &nbsp;  So then ciaoed back at 8pm past and decided to have a nice cool jog home. Turns out my hamstring isn`t troubling me as much as I though I could..Surprised I was running quite smoothly and no problems...Maybe the nagging and pulling pain isnt so severe or anything.    &nbsp;  Anyway had pizza for dinner. Then like Went online and then at like midnight I fell asleep. Woke back up at 1 am but then slept until 5:45 am..haha..and I was still 'online' and not away!Musta gotten disconencted :p. Heh and blogged my previous entries. It says so down there biatch!

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Well now, there seems to just be less and less people in school and specially my class...appearently Commencements and stuff. I guess my choir thing has been cancelled out...its 6 days away and still no sign of anything getting together!Well...no prefects in my class now that they are taking part in Commencements and stuff. Damn. Anyway my plan is to like go at 7 p.m or something and come home at like midnight past and stuff...hehe..Dunno what to wear yet..for shirt its either the  PDI&nbsp; Maroon long-sleeved shirt  or the  John Master   Blue long-sleeveed shirt  where the colours like 2 toned or maybe the  Snails 2-toned Pink elbow length sleeves ?    Oh the possibilities.Lets not even talk about shoes. Yikes..I sound so feminine!Lmao.     &nbsp;   Well, Sashya said the Bookmart was out of stock of the Bio text book...so returned  urlLink Nik  his 70 bucks.Book can be gotten at SBL in Taman SEA Appearently...hmm..     &nbsp;   Well I was taking my time getting ready for tuition and stuff..   Well mom dropped me off the the curb of Eon Bank and when I got out of the car, I saw  urlLink Jenny ,,  urlLink Michelle !, and like two other girls...I so wanted to meet up with Jen and Mich but like I had to get some goreng pisang for mom at the stall over next to Eon Bank, so got like rm3 worth of pisang abu , and gave the thing to mom, grabbed my bag and ran across the street looking for em...I thought they went into Telawi 3 so I went there although I was cause had Francis anyway there...So I stood in front of Coffee Bean and veered inside but didn`t see em...so I was thinking maybe they were going to McD`s so I like ran that way...and like I think GB saw me from the Gospel Centre, like runnin up the street away from the place...shutters quite see thru-able today.heh. Well I then was near Burger King and GB called and she`s like..there`s tuition on now..and I said yeah I know..i`m coming but I have something to attend to in the meantime but was on the way...anyway in the end, I dejectedly gave up looking for em..Maybe they had gone through Telawi 2 and were still on their way there?But i`ll neve knoe..maybe i`ll ask them..just maybe..but i`ll bet not..well I got to tuition at 4:50 pm instead.Heheh.Meng Kwong walked from home so he was late and came same time as me..but Francis was cool about it and stuff..In fact he didnt teach a thing yet!     &nbsp;   Well I was damn sharp during tuition man!Hehe.Francis said so. Its cause I haven`t had much homework during the week so could be relaxed a bit and didn`t study the most..so was quite relaxed and my mind was still sharp and I had totally forgotten about the earlier part of the day and crap.Damn, entering Susut Nilai into the various accounts is quite simple actually!Anyway sat next to GB although my view was like beautifully the ride side of the whiteboard,I`d rather sit there than next to Wei Hong or 'Jahiliyah' and get a proper view though where I sat was quite a nice spot.Heh.I doubt I would be strong enough to lift a table near him anyway, the tables felt so heavy for some reason so suited that I sit near GB and stuff.     &nbsp;   Well after tuition Kar Wai and the whole gang all at Irish Pub so lepak with them..but 1st lepak with GB still she left and stuff...me and Kar Wai talking about Shaun and stuff...said to him that GB is his girl but they are on and off...Kar Wai was like damn good only walking around with a file with tuition stuff put turn it around and there`s a Warcraft cd in the back.Lmao. Me and MK new that he couldn`t have been genuinely studying!haha...talked about the Shaun thing..he`s coming after school on Monday..He said he wants to change school but I told him..with they way he is now..he`ll have difficulty keeping up with the rules and he himself says that he has problems with Smkbb prefects and stuff that he can forget about SSC although he want to go there la and stuff...also met Izuan,Nicholas,Teng,Dede,Yan Wei and the othet guys..all at the 'only foosball table in Bangsar'.Playaz in Hartamas is just to darn far way!At 7pm theyw anted to makan...they ajak me but I was like...if I go..i`ll eat something..and I wanna stay fucking hungry and eat like a hog later at night to ciaoed home...Passed by BSC and Vishnu reminded me that I still haven`t poured Coke over him despite threatening every year for the last 4 or 5 years!Damn!What the heck happened?Met U-Waye as well.     &nbsp;   So mom and dad are outta town over the weekend and mom doesn`t want me going out and all leaving the maid and my grandma all alone..although i`ll still go out anyway..So got Domino`s Pizza for dinner!Yay!Breadsticks as well complimenting my Extravaganza and my Vegie Galore.So i`d have left-overs and stuff so no need to go out and get food and stuff.     &nbsp;   Well, asked Cheryl out but she was gonna be Malacca..so no Paella for us...and Sarah was gonna be at a family gathering so I wouldn`t be able to spend her on her coffee that ive oweed her for the last 8 or 9 months I think..Spanning from November or December last year. Terrible.Anyway lately helping Zhen Cui out with her blog and the template though I think ive done nothing much for her..     &nbsp;   Anyway Im blogging at this time cause like after midnight I was on and off sleeping on my parents bed so every now and then checking on the comp and my name is like online....but ive put it as away now.haha.online for one whole damn night. Aizyl messaged me at 3 am it seems asking why i`m up so late...he too is up what sow hy he asking :p.Heh I see Afantits is online but surprisingly no message sent to me.Goodlord he`s still online.     &nbsp;   Anyway i`m gonna get some sleep...gotta wake up at 9 am or so I think.Toodles.Saturdays entry will be up tommorow along with Link and the Chatterbox.I`ll still blog as usuall while waiting for Blogspot to fix up my problem.All ready written to them!

Lately ive been able to sleep early!yeah!to a point I wake up so often at night now and have trouble sleeping still at 6am...well mainly this is cause of the fact I can like sleep early is that I get my homework done now during the day time and not wait til night time to do it!been sleeping at 11pm or so the last few nights though tonight wont be so on target.More like old times.Hehe.Despite getting almost 8 hours sleep (I wake up at 7am most of the time hehe),I still remain sleepy in school and fall asleep.heh.

       I have not blogged since err sunday morning or the weee hours of sunday morning..quite a thing that aint happen much now these days..but since im not school 2day,I have quite a good mood to blog and stuff...:O) So lets get down to bussiness..about Sunday...  Woke up at like 9am..lepak all morning and finshied some homework...and noticed that Ali cafe drink..that 5 in 1! coffee drink that well has coffee (:P),ginseng,tongkat ali,sugar and creamer is quite nice!Maybe can save money on Strabucks now :P :P :P  So went to some Aneka Daya place in Ulu Klang looking for tiles and bathroom stuff for my new crib..lotsa nice stuff...even some instant water heater with a digital lcd screen which tells time and more crap to!rm1700!crazy...and damn..jaccuzi`s are like rm16000..who could afford that?Hmm likely everyone in school except me :(  ...So hopefully I get to choose the crap in my room and my bathroom...instead of me and my brother sharing one considerably bigger bathroom,we are gonna get our own small ones instead which is fine with me!So I guess that means the total number of bathrooms in the house will be 4 or 5...thats alot for the ammount of space in my house :p ..Although they wont be so big..and i`m taking the bigger room instead..let my brother have the small one..heck hes only around for a few days every few weeks or months!  Then went around Jalan Ipoh looking for tiles shops..all closed man..but its a Sunday so no surprises..hahahaha saw 'The Stone Shop'.Lol.Afandi owns it i`ll bet ..lmao0..  then went home cause it was rainin and crap but stopped by TMC 1st and bought almost rm150 worth of groceries...yay!have banana mania ice cream!:D :D  Finshed up more omework..bet rm20 with Afandi who I heard was betting big man..Finals of course though..  Didnt attend Najats party..had other things on...in fact only Afandi,Adrian and Zaffique came from Cempaka..and Zaffique came on his own..not surprising..since hes form 3 and stuff...  well thats all for that day and stuff...cau-cau..

        Yes...this about that Noritta Samsuddin trial..Hanif Basree as I myself thought was found innocent and sent free.Looking at how he was camera friendly and stuff for the trial,he just had to innocent and he really was.Looking at the evidence and stuff..but looking at it...how could he have been charged?Now the real killer is likely to escape or has and will never be found.  Well,he was accused of committing the murder between 1:30am - 4:30am at a condominium in Sri Hartamas on the 5th of December ,2003.He and Noritta knew eachother BUT he had an albi.An impeccable one.That night he was talking with his wife and sister in-law and her husband..just merely chatting and went to bed at midnight.All albi`s same!And hes been in Custody since December 8 2003.Damn.  The testimony of two security guards were not truthful.Their 1st statement had nothing abt Hanif.But all of a sudden after being thrown into lock-up they made a testimony claiming they last saw Noritta with him talking to people in a White Perodua Kancil.But where is the Kancil?What was the car registration number?They claimed to have forgotten.I think perhaps theyw ere threatened by the police.  But most importantly.The presence of DNA of two unknown males blurred the prosecution`s case.But who are they?They have his DNA but know clue who they are.And her roommate Nur Azora or Azura had seen a man reeking with body odour leaving and looked like an Indian and had long hair tied in a pony tail.Yeah...it does suit an Indian man`s description..  BUT one thing,She knew Hanif and had met him often and could tell the difference between him and the mystery man.Although in the dark,Hanif who must be 6'3 or 6'4 can be easily iddentified in the dark.Thats tall even in European standards!  The Defence claimed that they had shared an intimate relationship and that his DNA was found inside her and that they had sex.But he killed her on the motive of Jealousy as it is claimed he was jealous of Noritta`s close relationship with another man.But it is just a THEORY.In fact it is said he didn`t even know about their relationship and if so,why would he kill her without a motive?That went unanswered by the prosecution.  Well,after committing the crime,surely the mystery person(s) would have done whatever to make them un recognisable such as shaving off hair and blah.He in fact would have probably fled the country.Though they don`t have his name which would mean he can live normally,they have his DNA so should anything arise..that could be it for him..  They said not long after Noritta moved in,the other roommate some man names soemting..had moved out..they wondered did he ever give back the key?Because they found no signs of forced entry and that the killer was known to her.So why didn`t they go after him?If he is guilty..then he likely will not be found.  You have to say..perhaps as part of the media,perhaps they rushed the case.They hurried.They wanted to quickly charge someone to prove that they (the police) can do their job well and that Malaysia is a safe place to go to.While they proudly showed off that they had found the prime suspect,the real guilty person had time to escape and is likely reading the verdict of the trial in the newspapers and will think to himself that he is a good criminal.They never found him.  Do you think that there is a cover-up to protect a VIP or anything?could be possable.The prosecution just seemed to bring up things that would make Hanif look guilty without any reasons for what he did..claiming the injuries on Noritta is of by a big man and Hanif is a big man.But there very well could be a cover-up.The Judge denied there`s one.But possably.The IO at the time of the case,didn`t seem interested in persuing a second suspect.So you wonder..  Although the crime was shocking and caused a big outrage at first,its not like Noritta was a foreign tourist or the daughter of a big-shot of rich person.Yes,it is big news,but certainly not as big as it was made to be.They should also thing about the family of the victim and now also the now acquitted accused.How do they feel about all this?  Well I dont belive ive left anything more interesting or important out.  So my final conclussion is that : The killer will never be found.He`s covered his tracks well and will not re-surface again.

        Yes!Greece have pulled off the odds and eliminated the Czech Republic and reached the Euro 2004 final and will face Portugal in a rematch of the tournements opening game!Wee!Although Portugal will be much stronger and stuff...Well beta Afandi so I owe him no shit but I still aint profitted yet..damn..gurgh.  Well lets skip through what happened at school until Chemistry.So Mrs. Kalai was teaching us how to use the instruments and stuff for experiments!Woohoo!Looks like fun doing but must be careful and not do anything *too* stupid if I do an experiment in front of class :p.Well anyway The Chem Peka is soon I belive now...noooo!!!!That will mean..more..work!!!!Yikes!!!!  So tuition had only 6 ppl today since Ju Ean overslept and didnt come..which left me and GB sitting together at the back...and she thinks ive got something on with Alia after she went through my phone but its not true!Just cause was suppose to meet her for a drink!Hehehe!and I was teasing her about Shaun.Heh.Its obvious theres something between them.They go all over school together!Anyway Pelarasan is now over..yikes..I hate that chapter..so god dman awful..  So turns out Alia wanted to meet at BSC but I told her that I`m not gonna go cause its already like 6pm and stuff..how long am I gonna stay?30 minutes and spend err...5-10bucks on taxi payments?No way Jose!Sigh.If only she could come to Bangsar Baru instead.  So grabbed Swedish Berries at Coffee Bean.Iced Tea.Its not bad.Finally tasting it after ages of temptation.Was thinking highly of Vanilla and whatever stuff is with it.Well its not sweetened unsurprisingly,so 4 packets (!!!!!) Of sugar finaly did some job and made it more decently nice!Reddish even.Smells like Berries.What do you expect you idiot?  Well I now have this unhealthy craving for Prodigy.Specially Mindfields and Narayan.  well the tea is keeping me awake now.from maybe 10pm-midnight,I was lying down on my bed or sleeping on and off and leaving my radio on and the laptop volume of high so could wake uyp if some1 messaged me.Although sadly no one did I was glad so...can sleep..oh yeah..hehe...  anyway this tea is keeping me crazy.I dunno my plans for tommorow.I think i`ll leave to go find some kind of substance or tasty food to eat away at.Catch you guys later.  Oh yeah I watched a replay or a repeat of Real Madrid beating Barcelona 2-1 and winning at the Camp Nou for the first time in 20 years.To bad Overmars could be as consistent as he was in that game...The match was really close...Real Madrid owe alot to Iker Casillas.The players were celebrating like they won a cup final!Joan Laporta was absolutely stunned!

         Anyway last night I went for that KL Fashion Week Fashion show crap-pits in Telawi 3. I met Chaman at MPH and we went by Irish and met Loong,Ryan,Jin Yip, U-Waye,Izwan and a bunch of my old seniors were there...we watched Ganesh and Adrian play foosball...damn mad dickhead that Ganesh..shot so fucking hard til the ball flew outside and landed on the road...crazy..haha...Anyway watched Ryan and Loong play pool...and I played against Chaman..yikes..I ahte hate British pool tables...so sucky..and when I hit all my nice shots, no1 looked...when I messed up,everyone was laughing and watching.Bastards. Anyway we were stuck there since Modesto`s had people still occupying the damn tables. Harlots.  Well then the show had some dances and fashions shows obviously...the dance were pretty good and stuff..buncha nIgGa`s getting high next to us...'Mc`diver' as Ryan calls him, was there as usuall looking like stoned fuck. By the way... 'Mc`diver' is this guy in Bangsar whos like either drunk often and crap...Haha..Interesting characters that we have here in Bangsar...anyway they screened snippets of Putri Gunung Ledang...looks interesting...and the sound at the show was powerful..almost as rumb-blAiY as New Year`s Eve 2001 commin into 2002....  Anyway I went home at midnight...not much..just there for the fun of it...they had free Sprite Ice there so didn`t need to spend cas at Coffee Bean of something...And also cause mom let me out :p ...So why waste the oppurtunity? Anyway I was online from 12:30 am - 3:30 am...nothin g almost nothing happening..sigh...sad.Exams next week and other things are on my mind so can`t really study..yikes..Next week? oh dear the 9th of August that is..

       Well anyway I woke up at 11am today..i`m real tired after those computer work outs....I didn`t have enough strength to go on workout regime.. i`m still feeling the effects of fever. I think my back needs a bit more rest.  My vaccum is busted. Dang nab-bit. Bloody hell.  Good lord i`m hungry. I think i`ll go eat but wait..a little something to say first...  Me, Zainul, Divyesh, Hoong Zhang and Shahril are likely gonna be forming a band to play at Talent-Time. Wont be giving any details yet on what we could be performing as we haven`t gone for any jamming sessions yet. We should be jamming soon during the upcoming holidays or even as soon as the exams which are next week ;'(  end. It seems though that our choice of song to play is made up but we still need to see. I`m not saying anything though. Its gonna be a surprise here... but talk to me and i`ll liekly say it and whatever. Haha.  According to Shahril, it would be adviceable to play something not to heavy since the judge`s liekly wont like it very much. Likely something easy to play and something thats popular and will be liked by the audience although if we perform whatever horrendously, the audience wont love us obviously!  NOW. I shall go have a bite to eat. Spank-ME..I think i`ll go by Telawi and areas for the Loreal KL Fashion Week show here. Now ta-Ta.

       Well..i`m gonan be changing my laptop...for something that has a cd reader / burner and crap and also a floppy disk drive built internally. Since my dad wants to share it kinda, he`s bearing all this costs and crap so its all good for me...Dunno what laptop i`ll be getting though...hopefully it`ll have wifi-capabilities....I desperate need it!!!!  Anyway I got my Aztech USB Modem connected and installed on my Packard Bell...and also reinstalled Norton Internet Security 2004 on it so my computer will be sufficiently secure from viruses and that sortsa crap.   MY COMPUTER SPECS ARE :         2000 megahertz (2ghz)   512 MB RAM  dvd rom/cdr-w combo  60 gigabyte hard disk  wireless Logitech keyboard and mouse  Diamond audio speakers and subwoofer  RADEON VE graphics card  32 MB tv-out  Much more crap   Price   RM6000   What i`m I using it for now?  Listening to music. Sigh. What a waste of power! Its a very powerful system actually! Just gotta work out the kinks and blah though I belive it has been worked out. It sure doesn`t seem to be worth the damn money it cost...anyway its  2 years old only..  It`s suppose to last like another 1 or 2 years according to my beliefs. But I think i`ll make it last five years in total. Just some fixes up and maybe a change in graphics card and i`ll be whipping some serious mutha fUcking Ass!

             Yuck...I went by Bangsar Village yesterday evening..and there`s hardly anything!! The places that interest me most are   Starbucks  Aunty Anne`s Pretzel`s  Cinnabon  Nando`s  Laksa Shack..err ewww?   Other than that, theres a Toys R` Us, some grocery store which looks better than TMC, some Organics food store, buncha nice looking and likely not the cheapest restaurants...and MPH is soon to open but it`s storelot seems to be very small...unless its deep..doubt so...The Starbucks there is damn nice...not any places outside considerably yet, but there`s sofas near the windows and all...quite nice...I wonder what else will open up there..  Err tuition was fine. I little mind-boggled here but i`m A-o-kay! haha..Anyway I grabbed a arlic and also a Cinnamon Pretzel at Auntie Anne`s Pretzels and a Apple Bean with whip cream Frapp at Starbucks..quite nice..maybe a little sweeter and it would be nicer..along with a bit more apple essence...ya think..Anyway i`m gonna charge everything to my dad...nyeh nyeh!  Oooo I love Sarah`s new tetsi on me!I`m actually missed by people? Amazing!

      Well so I got ready to go at like 5:30pm and my parents sent me to the Cempaka Cheras Campus at about 5:50pm and got there around about 6:20pm or so.. First thing almost when I got there, met Chen and she told me Idzmil and all were downstairs at the canteen having dinner..So I went down there and met them! Sat across Zai and Iqah and Chris Wong, Nick Wong, Adrian Voon, Afandi, Lingesht and Idzmil were also at the table and then we got up and went to get dinner at the place..not much in the choice of food...it was obviously catered food..was okalh..not bad actually to say...I had that nasi briyani I think with ayam masak merah I think..haha and some fish..didn`t touch the caramel dessert which everyone else did and said NOT to take it..haha..After retreiving my camera which was abducted by Zainul, me and Idzmil went to the hall...he was actually there to go find chicks and stuff...bloody hash-him! *sneezed* haha...  And then outside the hall they had these really cool small tv screen on those stands they use for speeches...in fact they have water dispensers on the bottom, but they didn`t put any water to give and stuff...and plus cups would be a problem anyway :p ...So on the tv screen,they put the names of those who were getting awards and stuff..and for Handball, Idzmil`s name was put as  Adzmi Hashim ... AHAHAHAHAH!!!!! What made it funnier was that he received School Colours Awards but nobody told him! ahaha! So didn`t go in the morning to collect them at the smaller award ceremony whichw as at like 8 or 9am...nyeh nyeh!  So we went looking for seats upstairs...cause like..sitting downstairs you can`t see any shit for nuts..so we went upstairs..wanted to sit at the very back row at the top..but got shooed off by JY who sai that place is for prefects and crap..mother...Idzmil wanted to around there cause of err 'certain someone' was sitting nearby..haha..So anyway on the left side of the upper deck (in a way) or upper level of the hall, was emtpy spots...so grabbed chairs and sat there with Zainul and Haziqah( their names need to be said in that way)..,Idzmil, Farah .D, and dunno la form 1 fellas whose name`s remain a mystery that Im not interesting in solving to me...And Jamal was up and down but mainly sat there..for much longer period of times.. The seats were the best in the house I say..but...it was in front of all those air-con vents...yeah..they are huge..so it was so cold...wearing blazer and rolled down long sleeves doesn`t help all too much..haha..!But it was damn nice and windy and stuff...so no chance anyone who sat there would complain about to little air or oxygen there...haha...although I do agree with Jamal a bit that it seemed like the air was being sucked up and crap..So anyway had to grab some chairs and stuff...haha..just grabbed some when nobody was looking..hehe..  Well after about waiting for an ice age, eating Haziqah`s snack and stuff...the show finally began which had some opening speeches and the teachers all ushered in wearing graduation robes and stuff to show apprieciation to them and stuff....the teacher who got the biggest roar was Ms Tok who wears only a few different dresses a year and stuff...but tonight she was wearing a spaghetti strap and had make up and glitter and sparkling stuff all over her..whole place errupted...aheheh..Pn Nora also had alot of cheers...  So then Cheryl sang the school song..and now I know why she`s in YKLS and stuff...she`s quite good..And then they gave out special awards for people who`s name`s will go into a book which makes them a true Cempakan for life and stuff cause they`ve made the school proud and stuff...they stand on stage...someone of their choice will read out a short speech about them and their acheivement`s, rank,posts, awards and stuff with curicular and studious stuff...and the projector will show their name and picture...and wow..me and Jamal were thinking and talking...what an honour it is for your name to be inside there...its something thats once in a lifetime..something that`s deserved..something that you work so hard for...its a privilage that not many can and ever will get as a student in their schooling days and stuff people get..Its a thing that you can cherish for the rest of your life...and for them..they will...in that book..wow...sigh..I doubt my name will ever enter it...but most people who`s name`s got isndie have been with the school while they were 1st grade or slightly older..damn damn damn..they have quite a few categories and things, special awards..but well...not easy to be there..its like a club only for those privilaged...a lifetime membership..but something that money doesn`t buy..its the ahrd work put in and made possable by the money paid and stuff for it..all I can say is...wow...  Then the shows started while they were preparing for the main attraction..yikes..all those fellas who booked tables got to eat dinner then and they had nice food and stuff...damn jealous..next year, we have vowed to  book a table  an toast away! And laugh at everyone else! Haha..its only rm500 for a table so rm50 a person with 10 seats at the table would do just nicely..Then we can waylay who else didn`t have get a table and stuff..!And jeesh! There were emtpy tables..if coulda bought them at that time anyway..hahahahahaha..  Anyway them weird Cheras ppl peformed 1 dance..which was quite good..1 guy did that baksetball thingy around the inside ur shirt..damn..he must be into street..Cheryl and Sarah with Sue Ann at the piano sang and danced to 'All that Jazz'..Kent and I think Jinn Cheok and Kah Hon played 'Penny and me'..David,John and err Brandon played 'Valentine' I think..then Shen Jin fella played something as well..there was someother dances and songs as well...quite nice actually..eheh..then came the main show!  It was 'Wizard of Oz'. It started off with Dorothy (played by Anastacia) in her home which was in Kansas and there was a tornado..she had left her hosue but went back in as she left something but she was to late and she blacks out..heh...and then she wakes up in a different land...and is found by I the soceress or Witch of East or West? Err whatever it is played by Andrea who looked hot in that white dress and with that make up on..heheh..and her voice was very fairy godmother like..haha..and she ( Dorothy) was told that Oz (who was played by Hui Jien) had the power to grant wishes and could b ring her back...and btw she was in Munchkin Land..with all those weirdly dressed up 'short' haha...people who were all friendly and dacing and singing and all...ahaha..And sometime soon I belive Dorothy sang err what was it..err...ah! Somewhere over the Rainbow.. Anyway on the way looking for Oz, she encountered a The Scarecrow (played by Nicholas Tan) who was stuck to a pole and suppsoe to scare away crows obviosuly from the fields...but it wasn`t working and he was wishing he had a brain..haha! Well Dorothy then freed him but he had trouble talking and stuff...ahaha...So after being told of what Oz could do for him, he followed Dorothy..and before that The Scarecrow sang some song and stuff.aheheh.. Then I think the next guy they encountered was The Tin Can Man (played by Nigel Ang)..who has well..'rusty parts'...and he then proclaimed he needed a heart...and they made him fixed up somewhat by 'spraying WD40' on him..lmao..and then he sang 'What if I had a heart' changing the lyrics of 'What a Wonderful world' around...AHAHA!!.I like the way he spoke throughout the show and his super shiny silver costume...damn chunted... The the next fella they met (after being told by the Munchkins and crap and the soceress that they had to go through the forest which was full of bears) was the lion...in the forest of course...but the lion (played by Shazzy) was some coward..he only ruled the jungle cause the bears were afraid of his site..but he claimed he was fearing the day that the bears may no longe rbe afraid of him as he had no 'courage'..hahahahaha..and he sang some song about that crap...and yes he followed them to see Oz but eachtime they encountered soemthing new, he tried to err chicken out but they kept pulling him back and yes..he was gonna ask for courage.aehheh.. So err what happened...aha...they err met some ppl la whoever they were and stuff...err aha!Gloria who was played by Cheryl and her dad and stuff who was oddly played by Farah Zuleika...haha..weird..so err whatever it is soon they were on their way to see Oz but were warned not to make them angry..and btw Jackshen..played a..butler!haha!Or was a waiter!WHo cares!haha! Oh yeah the Witch..played by Azra...was the best man..her voice and her laughs were spectacular!Haha..jamal was laughing to death....and she had planned to kill Dorothy although I think Dorothy had some spell but on her by thes soceress so that she couldn`t be harmed..?Err btw during that time was horrendous...dont look left!Bloody hell Zainul and Haziqah 2 much..make out..Idzmil said he saw them frenching..who cares..I dont care abt what I dont see...but fuck you could her the sound effects!Fucker!*MUAH MUAH* yuck! And in the meantime the witch caught Dorothy and Tibia her assistant played by werr Chong Ian were like trying to cook her in a big pot!? like soem sacrifice thing..and haha...the 2 witches (Sarah and Constance) were aguing abt whos better and stuff..and haha..the role Constance was complaining to me abt..she had to flirt with Chong Ian..ahaha..and she was trying to 'take him home' ahahaha..so soon anyway after having some pain from his head, the scarecrow and co found Dorothy and killed the witch and stuff....oh before that they had a skeleton dance..with like all the lights turned off and stuff...and like 15 or 20 ppl dressed in the skeleton suits that glow blue in the dark started dancing to Eminem`s 'The Real Slim Shady'...damn chun..ahaha...   Oh yeah met Oz earlier and he said he`d grant his wishes if they killed the witch and they did anyway so they came back for their wishes...he said he couldnt grant them..then the Lion just all off a sudden rammed into a wall and Oz was revealed as some guy who looks like a waiter or a Butler..haha...he said their wishes didnt need to be granted cause they had all shown all the wishes they wnated by showing courage, a heart, brains...while Dorothy couldn`t et home..but all of a Sudden she was back home in Kansas and thus endth the story..  So after that lepak outside with every1...Afandi and all went back as they were spending the night at his place in Kenny Hills,so met with some ppl and bla..met Allyna out there..then Sarah and like Farah who was looking for her and stuff...then met Cheryl who had all that giesha like make up on her and they all went back with Yu Shen except Sarah and Farah whos parents were there...then talked to Jason (Soh) after calling my parents...and he was like...despite attending Commencents year after year, he still never learns and is one of the last few ppl there..and he was!
