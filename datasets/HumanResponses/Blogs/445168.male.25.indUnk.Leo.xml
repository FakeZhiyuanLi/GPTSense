                         I Don't Care if Nobody Loves Me           After tomorrow night, film history will be made. Perhaps the most violent most sadistic film ever made will hit theaters, and the churches will be there in the thousands. I have followed the production of  The Passion of the Christ  ever since Mel Gibson announced his plans last year.  The buzz around this film is mind-numbing sometimes. It seems like everyone has something to say about it, and I have read at least 300 articles on this thing in the past 5 months.  I think that Mel Gibson has given us a wonderful gift, and God has blessed this production immensely. The biggest question that people seem to wonder about would be : Is the film Anti-Semitic? That's total bullshit! I have only heard that argument once a few years ago, and I found it laughable.  So to even hear the ADL and Mr. Foxman complain about Gibson's movie, it makes me sick to my stomach.  Now, are the Jews responsible for killing Jesus? No, the human race is responsible. The Bible clearly states our depravity and our need for God. Christ willingly let Himself be arrested, scourged, condemned and crucified, all for the sake of mine and your sins.  Now if you want to get technical, the Jewish Sanhedrin conspired to kill Jesus, and Pilate gave the order to crucify Him, however, this does not give anyone right to constitute blame to one, or any specific people group.  I wouldn't blame the Jews as a people group for killing Jesus, any more than I would blame the Germans for the Holocaust.      Now, as of late I have been reading about all these Churches renting out theaters on opening night. It seems at least around my area that if you don't belong to a local church, your shit outta luck in going to see The Passion for the next few days. If you cannot tell, this idea bothers me . Heres why.........this movie, although blatantly Christian, was not made in order for evangelicals to finally get off their asses and go to the movies. It was not made for churches to rent out theaters for their congregations to have a Wednesday night service! It was not made "for us, by us", even though I think every christian should be out there supporting this film. I just don't think renting out movie theaters is the way to go about it. Pay your admission prices and stand in line like everyone else!  By this next statement, many of you will promptly disagree with me, but I do not think that we christians should be trying to claim this film for ourselves.  Here is what I mean by that: Modern christian cinema has given us badly written, candy coated shit like  Left Behind  and  The Omega Code .  They shy away from being realistic for fear of being offensive, or worse...Receiving an "R" rating. And we all know that good christians do not go see R- rated films, beacause they are evil.  (Let's just casually ignore the fact that the Bible is R-rated in some parts, and sex, murder, and violence is  frequently in it's pages) So we have traded realism for a false pharisee-like morality, when it comes to film.  There is no one in the " christian" film industry that would have had the balls to make  The Passion  the way that Gibson has done. I think all the media influences would have shut the project down, God forbid we offend someone.  Maybe I am being too harsh and perhaps even offensive to some, but my view is....someone has to.  I do not like, nor support the idea of modern evangelicals renting out movie theaters and making witnessing packs in conjuction with the release of the film.  Praise the film . Go see the film . Take unsaved people to see the film. But let the power of the Gospel do it's job, you don't have to ease it along.  Gibson's film, from what I can tell, presents  the Gospel in a remarkable way, using one of the most effective mediums in our modern world. No one will leave this film unchanged. Visually, the trailers have given me chills, and I know that this will be the most moving portrayal of Christ that has ever been produced, and I strongly feel like we need to let the Gospel speak for itself.                       The truth is never sexy, so it's not an easy sell                   You can dress her like the culture, and she'll shock em just as well                   She don't need an apology for being who she is                   And she don't need your help making enemies.                                              -Derek Webb

           I Wrecked My Car         I am pleased to announce that my car is totaled. I am ok though, although I think I should be dead right now. I only hurt my shoulder and I have a scrape on my head, so thank God I am fine. If you know anyone giving away a car, or alot of money, let me know.  Since then I have been humming a Dave Matthews tune about a car crash.                       So Damn Lucky     Everything's different  My head in the clouds   I hit this corner  With my foot on the gas  I started sliding, I lose it  Everything's different just like that   Oh my God, wait and see  What will soon become of me?  Frozen heart  Screaming wheels  Does that screaming come from me?   So damn lucky, that you went on ahead  You said, you said  "I'll see you later..." I heard what you said a few minutes later  Now I'm sliding  And everything's different again   Oh my God, wait and see  What will soon become of me?  This frozen heart  Screaming wheels  Does that screaming come from me?  I'm dizzy from all this spinning   Now I'm thinking that you did all you could  When you said "My love  Take it slowly..."  "Ok," is what I said  Oh my God, wait and see  What will soon become of me?   This frozen heart  Screaming wheels  Does that screaming come from me?   Take me back, 'cause just before I was spinning  Take me back, to before I got dizzy  Take me back, amazing what a minute can do  Just like you  So, so, slide, slide, up, around, around, around  Amazing what a minute can do  Around, Around, Around  "Forgive me", "Ok."

        Introduction       I love doing things on a whim.  I retired from my old blog in order to focus on writing a screenplay, and yet here I am again. Quite frankly, I still had alot to say, but I don't think my retirement from To Whom was premature. It was something I needed to do, the site was running very well, and I know I left it in very capable hands.  Now I find myself wanting to head in a new direction with my postings, and I am starting things slow and simple....hence the site name.  The blogging snobs are going to hate me, because I don't have a pretty template, which is fine by me. Links and comments will be up shortly, and hopefully something good will come of this site eventually.  My goal is to be able to express myself and my views in a coherant manner, without holding back on anything. Hopefully I will become bold and controversial, and perhaps even offensive at some points. Don't worry though, there will be some comic relief as well, if for anything else but to make me laugh.   A big focus on here will be artistic expression, especally in the area of film making. I plan on writing quite a few articles on film in the coming weeks.  My tenative list is as follows:                   Oscar Picks                  The Christian and film                  Controversy in Movies                 "Passion of the Christ" film review   Most likely none of these will get written, but it's fun to make lists isn't it?  I am sure there will also be some posts detailing my mundane life, so I am sure there will be something for everyone. (insert evil laughter here)

        My Girlfriend Wrote This     My beautiful and amazing girlfriend Kate wrote this little poem.  I really liked it, and thought it was very beautiful. So here it is.      always look life in the face and accept it for what it is accept its beauty. are you alive?  sometimes we lose ourselves for so long we are no longer living life is hurt and pain, its pictures and glimpses of happiness  but most of all its beautiful.  we never slow down and let the music of life just fill our ears  listen to the amazing words it tells us. you can choose your death or you can choose life.  its a beauty only enhanced by its difficulties to realize it.  all things good or bad, make a piece of living art.

                         Beautiful Brutality      I have sat down many times to write this, and I havent been able to find the words. Last Wednesday night I went to see  The Passion of the Christ . I sat for two emotionally draning hours, watching the most horrifically beautiful film I have ever seen. I was transfixed on the screen, I couldnt physically move, or even cry.  All I did was sit and experince it.  After it was over, I just sat there...trying to digest what I had just seen.  I was silent for about 30 minutes after it was over. I couldnt even talk about the movie, I was so affected by it. Thos images are burned into my brain forever, and I am grateful for it. Christ's love for a horrible person like me.....it amazes me. I don't know why He saw something in me that made all that suffering worth it. I am an unfaithful whore, more focused on what makes ME  happy, than what God would have me do.  I wouldn't have died for somone as ungrateful as I am.   Yet something else resonates beyond all the suffering Christ went through: love. He did all of that..because He loved me, and everyone else in the world. I feel so unworthy of that love, it's something that I take for granted every day I live.  Thankfully, God's grace is unending, and thats how I can continue to go on.  Dispite all my failures (and there are many), He looks beyond all of that and loves me anyways. It's beautiful, and humbling at the same time. Watching  The Passion  really put me in my place, in a sense anyways.  I can still close my eyes and see the blood and hear the whips and the hammers. It was an amazing experince seeing this film, and I do not have the words to discribe it. All I can say is how it has affected me. God's hand was on this movie, and everyone should go see this film. It is bloody, violent and very hard to watch, but go see it.  If this film doesn't move you, and make you re-evaluate things, then your way more stubborn in your ways than I am.  Go see it, and give me some feedback on what your thoughts are.

        Willy Wonka's School of Rock       Lately I have been listening to alot of music, and buying alot of cheap cd's from record stores. In the past month I have gotten over 20 cd's...I think.  Music is so important to me, and it speaks to me in a way that no art form could. People ask me all the time why I am not in a band, or writing music, and to be honest, I didnt always have an answer. I think I have the talnet for it, but I always end up feeling trite or cliche when I write something. I could never mimic the open honesty of Bob Dylan, or be as poignant as U2, and never even come close to the musical virtuosity of the Dave Matthews Band. Lyrically I could never match the deep, brooding lyrics of Pedro the Lion, or the theologically infused songs of Derek Webb.  I would feel like a fish trying to swim upstream, fighting to find my place among the great ones. Maybe thats why I don't push myself to do more musically.    Then theres the music industry......if you can call it that. Over the past 50 or so years that rock has been a form of music, things have changed so much. It seems like something is missing from popular music today. It all seems a little too glamorous, maybe a little too skin happy?   It seems to be alot more about selling a product, than it is about expressing yourself.   Now it seems to be about radio singles and shocking  everyone than it is about getting on stage and playing you heart out. Today's musicians would rather bare their bodies than their souls. Why do I live in a culture where Britney Spears can lip lock Madonna and no one even blinks? Why is it ok for Justin Timberlake to rip of Janet Jackson's clothing and give the FCC a heart attack? What the hell has happened to music? It's not even about the music anymore, it's about the show. MTV  is singlehandedly destroying music, and doesn't even notice.  I guess this is why I have divorced myself from what would be considered popular music. I wanna see artists step up and express themselves. Why doesn't anyone dream anymore?  Where is the John Lennons and Bob Dylans of today?  I want something a little deeper than " I wanna rock your body" but maybe thats just me.  Most of today's culture would not agree with me at all, since the music is so catchy.  It just really saddens me, I wish people would think about the value of music, and become a little deeper in what they listen to.  I wanna see some dreamers again in the world of music.     We are the music makers, we are the dreamers of dreams-                                                           Willy Wonka

             Buy Me a Drink and Let's talk Theology       I have been listening to the new  urlLink Pedro the Lion  cd "Achilles Heel", it's an amazing album. Just wanted to post these lyrics to one of the new songs, it is my favorite song on the album.    Also Pedro is going to play some songs and interview on  urlLink KEXP  Seattle radio on May 25th at 9 am (pt). You can listen to it online, and if you miss the broadcast they will archive it, so you should be able to catch it sometime.                The Fleecing   deep green hills whose shoulders fade into thick grey/ tall wet grass whose flesh makes fools of grazing sheep/ whose fleecing makes a fool of me/ who shall i blame for this sweet and heavy trouble/ for every stupid struggle i don’t know/ i could buy you a drink/ i could tell you all about it/ i could tell you why i doubt it and why i still believe/ i can’t say it like i sing it/ i can’t sing it like i think it/ i can’t think like i feel it/ and i don’t feel a thing/ ...why i still believe it/ why i need it/ and what the pharisees can’t see/ we’d have more drinks/ and speak of so many things / but i don’t know you and you don’t know me        One of the most honest songs about faith I have ever seen. It pretty much discribes me most of the time. Go out and buy the album when it releases May 25th. God bless.

                 Talk to Me Like You don't Know What We ever Fought About     The past few days have been ....well....quite interesting. I have been thinking about what it means to be in love today. In my experince with love, it seems feelings sometimes gets pushed aside and makes way for monotony. First of all, let me say that I am no good at relationships. My track record with women speaks for itself, love seems elusive to me. However, dispite all my shortcomings God had decreed that I meet this amazing girl. This girl has taught me more about love than I ever thought I could learn. I would like to spend the rest of my life repaying her for all she has done for me. Let me go ahead and confess......lately I have been an asshole. I havent been very good about giving her time, and showing affection. She is all the way in Lousiana right now, so I cant excatly spend alot of time with her, except on the phone. So that part is hard for me, and I tend to get wrapped up in other things, things that are not as important to me as she is.  So then by the time I call her, I am dead tired..and my selfishness takes over, and sleep has to ensue. So instead of spending time with my beautiful girlfriend, I opt to fall asleep and dream what it would be like to spend time with her. So this post is my penance,and I am tired of being so neglectful. I have prayed about this today, and spent alot of time turning things over and over in my head. All I do know is that I love this girl, and I want to be with her and make her feel like a queen. I hope I can acocmplish this, because she is an angel to me. Kate, I love you baby.

       It's been a long time since I have posted, and alot of new changes have been happening. I am finally out of Graceville and have moved to Ocala, FL. It's alot different here, and alot less familar to me. Things are going fairly well, I am still searching for a job. I think I may be able to get one at Best Buy, so keep your fingers crossed?   In reediting this post, I have finally found something to talk about.  Jeremy and I have been discussion different ideas about movies.  Did I not tell everyone? We are going  to be big time movie makers!  We have a few ideas for short films, and my ideas for full length movies are finally taking shape.. More news when I have it.

          In my vain attempts to explain myself when it comes to God's sovereignty and the origins of sin, I have been forced to rethink what I have said.  This sermon really helped me out in being able to define what I think.

            Where theres a will theres a....wait a minute        I have a love/hate relationship with theology. I think knowing what and why you believe is very important, and yet I get annoyed at the endless battle with reason. My beliefs have changed alot over the past year, to the dismay of many and the relief of some. My constant struggle with the idea of Predestination, and how it ties into the responsibility of mankind tends to get tiresome. There honestly isn't alot of people I can share my concerns with, cosidering alot of my friends are supporters of the "free will" myth. This is the part of the show where I get into trouble,since my current line of thinking leaves no room for mankind to have any free will. Most people would gasp at the thought, since we all love the idea of having control of our lives. My views are vastly different. I do not think we have any control, and that all we have is God. Our lives exsists because God breathed life into us. Scripture says that we are nothing without Christ, and that every breathe we take is a gift from the Lord. It says out natural inclination is to hate God, and our hearts are evil. The bible says we have a sin nature, which to me says that we sin on instinct. Mankind sins not because we choose to, but because it's our very nature to do so. Some would say that if this is true then God in some way "makes" us sin. To this statement I say: your right. God created us with the ablity to sin, just as he created a cow to eat grass. Is God the author of sin? I do not know. I do know that there is nothing that can happen outside of the will of God. There is no screwing up of God's plan, or doing anything that is outside of His plan for us. So by saying that I could venture to say that God did perhaps create sin. But God hates sin right? Yes He does, but He also created the world, called it good and then decided to destroy it because of all the evil that man had done. You think that happened outside of his will? Does that seem like a God who is not consistant? Is it so far fetched to think that maybe God is all knowing, all controlling, and knows what He is doing a little more than we do? Who are we to even make the claim that we can subvert God's plan. Who are we to even question God? He created us and gave us life, and we have the gall to say what He can and can't do? Are we so pompous to think that we can actually refuse God? How can we think we have a free will that somehow makes us higher than God Himself? I think it stems from mankinds age old desire to be like God. So why not invent a mythical will of our own to make us godlike? Does sound a bit Tower of Babel-iss don't you think?

         I wrote this in class today, since I was bored and needed something more worthwhile to occupy my time. For a long time I have said I was going to write a book called "What I believe". I guess its more of a credo of my theology than anything else.       Since my "conversion" to reformed theology (or the dark side as Jeremy calls it) I have had this renewed boldness to my faith. Last week Jeremy and I got into a discussion about this, and he asked me "How has becoming reformed helped you?" and " How does your views help bring others to know Christ?". I didnt really have a clear answer at the time. I think the only thing I said was that it helped me become bolder in my faith. This is not the only reason however, and I have given this question alot of thought. Why would it be important to have sound doctrine? Is my theology sound? Not completely, considering I have a finite mind and my comprehension only goes so far. I do believe in what the Bible says on things, and I try to take things as literal as I can. I have been trying to be true in my interpretation of scripture and I do believe that there is absolute truth. Have I found it yet, I don't know for sure.      I hate paradoxes, and I hated running into them in the Bible. I never doubted the truth of the Bible, however I did doubt my reasoning when it came to interpretation. I was fighting with the idea of free will for a very long time, and it was killing me. I could not find evidence of man's will being completely free in the Bible. Then I made the mistake of reading Romans, a book with a famous chapter that I overlooked. A better word would be ignored. Thats where I hit my wall. I didnt change my views yet however, I was a stubborn kid. I remember making this statement wuite a few times. I said "I will not serve a God who picks and chooses who goes to heaven." God said " Oh yes you will". Guess I spoke too soon.       I started reading this book called "The Sovereignty of God" by A.W. Pink, which really shattered alot of my presuppositions. I tested it with scripture to make sure Pink's interpretations were sound. I couldnt argue with it, no matter how much my mind wanted to. In alot of ways it was a breath of fresh air.      I've been accused of taking the easy way out theologically. Calvinism is not an easy road to walk on,even when you are convinced you are walking in the light of truth. Try coming to terms with your own depravity and then admit to yourself that you do not have once ounce of control of your destiny. Try understanding that the only reason you breath is because God is powering your lungs. Or that the only reason you exsist is because God willed you into being. You have no choice when it came to breathing or being created, it was an act of God. Thats a hard pill to swallow. Then you start looking into your own role in salvation, and realize you dont have one. The only thing you can do is respond to God's action of drawing you to Himself. Yet another hard pill to take.        After that my world was changed, my views on God were altered. I saw Him alot differently after that. I saw Him as a ruler over every aspect of my life, and I finally truly understood His lordship over us all. Things that I had somehow forgotten about over the years. That is one of the reasons that having doctrine is important, because it affects how you view God.      In a few days I am going to post my thoughts on the origins of evil. This is a tough subject to talk about, and I think I am gonna get called a heretic, but what can you do? So stay tuned.

              This past week was really good. I finished my first month here at Full Sail,and I passed both of my classes,so thank God for that. Thursday night I was blessed to go see the Dave Matthews Band in Tampa, which was incredible. The band was on fire, and played for about 2 hours. They played 4 new songs, which blew me away. This is a band that is in their prime, and you can tell by the passion and the tightness of the band. I honestly feel like they are one of the greatest bands of all time, and they will be around for many more years to come. However, Linkin Park wont be.     I also was able to see the latest movie by M. Night Shyamalan. I loved it. "The Village" is by far my favorite film that M. Night has done. Alot of people tend to pigeon-hole Shyamalan as a film maker, as they keep expecting him to repeat The Sixth Sense over and over. His films are more character driven than cheap scares. The Village does have it's creepy moments, but it is not the main focus. The theme of this film I think, is fear and mythology, and how it affects us. The movie was a few flaws, the main one being the dialogue. Some of it was hokey, but perhaps it was meant to be so, considering how the film turns out. Go see it, and form your own opinion.      I am been delving in the Bible lately. Been going through ths Gospel of John, and my eyes have been opened to alot of things. Its a truly amazing book, and it's been fun to exegete some of the passages to understand what Christ was saying. Thats about it on the homefront, I will update again soon.
