      We had a bit of a tough night last night.  Oliver has been sick and is on antibiotics, and last night he begged to go to bed (highly unusual).  He woke frequently, crying and saying that his head was all jumbled up and that his whole body hurt.  The pediatrician said just to watch him closely.  He finally fell into a restful sleep and this morning seemed to be better.    It is amazing how a child can change your life.  He is the most precious thing in the world and it is so terrifying to think something is wrong that I cannot fix or understand immediately.  So, to all those new parents, the sleepless nights never really end.   Which is not a bad thing.  After all, who would want to sleep through this?

      The family went to the bank and deposited all the change that Oliver has extracted from me and Amy into his account.  Out of the kindness of his heart he also opted to donate $10.00 to the Children's Miracle Foundation of Manitoba.  His donation qualified him for a new stuffed animal he is quite the philanthropist.

      Our lunch yesterday was a Thai salmon salad with a ginger and lemongrass dressing - that sounds much more appetizing than "cold pasta."  I guess the subtleties were lost on the diner.  Or maybe he wrote that to entice me to get involved with the family blog project, which to date I have been largely ignoring.    On another note, I just finished "A complicated kindness" by Miriam Toews.  She has created a character that I couldn't stop thinking about.  Very captivating story, and by a local author, at that!  Also, if you haven't read "Running with Scissors" by Augusten Burroughs and are in the mood for a trainwreck, pick it up.  A tragic and compelling story - available at your local library.

      We went to Minaki for the day.  Things went well, with the exception of a freeze damaged part of the toilet.  luckily it is a cheep part.    Oliver is a bit under the weather so we did not spend the night.  The big news is we picked a site for his Tree Fort, and have contacted Rob to stat building within the next two weeks.

      For the 10% of you who have not yet heard, Oliver is getting a treehouse this year.  It will be built in Minaki by Rob Bennett, and will be NEXT to a tree (not in a tree).  It will be 8' X 12' in total, including the deck and will be 7-8' off the ground.  It will have a ladder onto the deck, and eventually all kinds of neat kid/spy/wizard gadgets and features like peep holes and trap doors and secret compartments.  We were hoping it would be complete by this weekend, June 4, but with all the rain, it may be delayed.  Oliver is completely obsessed with this - he is constantly organizing things for the treehouse, making treehouse art, inviting kids to his treehouse and making requests for special features like an elevator and a microwave.  What fun to be a kid!

      Last night, we were at Home Depot, with most of the rest of Winnipeg.  There were very few cashiers and the lines were long.  I had been chatting with the man in front of me, an early-fifties type, dressed as though his wife selected his casual clothes.  Definitely white collar.  He had a 6-7' tall trellis and a watering can.  We were commiserating about how slow the lines were moving, how they needed to have more registers open, etc.  In fact, our cashier had completely disappeared.   After about 10 minutes, he asked me if I thought anyone would notice if he just walked out.  I ASSUMED he was kidding.  Then he left!  With his (non)purchases!  I really thought that maybe he was joking, or was just putting things in his car, but he never returned!  I keep thinking about the guy.  He is probably a financial planner someone is trusting with their money, or a school administrator Winnipeg is trusting with its children, or an attorney being trusted to keep someone's best interests in mind.   I wonder what he is doing today.

        Last night, I read an article that my friend Jennifer (with son, Luke, in above photo) gave me from the National Post about "Careers Curtailing Children."  It is not necessarily a new topic, but a recent study of Canadian professional women confirmed what we already knew and put it in writing - that women are putting children on hold to focus on careers first.  The article cites workplace practices and governmental policies as reasons, although I would add, that particularly in Winnipeg, the inadequacy of daycare solutions for children under two is certainly a deterrent.  Anyway, what WAS new and interesting, is that Canada's birth rate is currently 1.5 children per couple, which is well below the population replacement level of 2.1 kids per couple, which is being called a "global employment issue" with implications for the labor force, pension plans, immigration policies and Canada's general global competitiveness.   Then, I read a second (and very disturbing article) from the June 10, 2004 Rolling Stone titled "Diary of a Dying Planet."  This is not just another article about global warming, but actually reviews some of the projected and worst case scenarios.  Did you know that 19 of the 20 hottest years on record have occurred since 1980?  Or, that in 15 years, Kilimanjaro's permanent ice cap will have completely melted?  Or that Glacier National Park will no longer have any glaciers by 2030?  Or, that the US emits 25% of the world's CO2 and that the Bush administration withdrew from the Kyoto protocol and implemented voluntary standards and has been openly censoring the EPA reports on global warming?  (You probably knew that one.)  All of this has occurred or will occur within my lifetime, and this is not an act of God, but rather an act of man.  Apparently, one possible scenario is that the extreme heat will result in rapid melting of all the ice, which will in turn impact the Gulf Stream and cause Europe to go into a deep freeze and the rest of the world to sizzle.  The earth's "Carrying Capacity" will significantly decrease.  Which, may be another reason for the decline in birth rates  - mother's intuition, anyone?  Regardless, extensive damage has already been done to the environment, but we can make a difference.  We should all do what we can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Take the bus, carpool, buy a hybrid car, live off the grid, vote against Bush, whatever it takes.

        My first visit to the Superstore was on October 24 or 25, 2000.  We has just immigrated to Winnipeg (October 22), and upon unpacking, I found myself in need of just about every household and grocery item you can imagine.  Not sure what to expect for a "Superstore," but being sold on the idea that it was where we needed to go, Oliver and I set off.  Three hours and several hundred dollars later, we emerged, certainly not with everything we needed, but feeling as though we had been on an adventure.  What a selection!  We had NOTHING like this in the US.  Every ethnicity was represented (some better than others - the Winnipeg selection of authentic Mexican grocery products is still severely deficient), we browsed and we sampled and we dug through bins.  Some brands were familiar; others were very foreign and required some translation.  Grocery items in Canada do not have the same nutritional labeling requirements, so it was hard to compare products.  Also, 50% of the label was in French, which also made my first shopping experience more of a challenge.  We bought all kinds of things, mostly out of excitement and for the sheer experience.  This, in many ways, was the embodiment of our inter-country relocation!  Our grocery shopping habits have settled down; we have a more-or-less established routine and have preferred brands and vendors.  We have met local merchants and try to patronize neighborhood stores.  But, Superstore will always hold a special place in our hearts.

      A woman and her son walk into a Thai restaurant.  (Ok, it's Oliver and me.)  We had stopped by our favorite Thai place (One Night in Bangkok) on our way home from the pediatrician's office last night (Oliver has mono, but is fine) to pick up dinner.  Oliver asks the lovely Asian server her name, and she says "U" (or maybe "You" or "Ewe," but you get the idea).    Oliver IMMEDIATELY goes into a one-man-show with "You?  Wow!  That's really easy to spell!  It's just a "U!"    And was met with a puzzled look.  Then he says "Hey!  If you were lost outside, I could just say 'Hey, U!  Where are U?  Come here, U!' "  And, this time, he got a polite, but confused smile.  "And wouldn't it be CRAZY if my name was 'ME'????  Then we would be 'U' and 'ME'!!!"  To which our lovely Asian server says " You have nice child.  No shy." and walks away.  You should know, and with sincerest apologies to all my friends with names that are difficult to spell or pronounce, that I laughed until I cried.  And, I will have leftover delicious panang curry for my lunch today.

      We are back in Winnipeg, all refreshed from our first real weekend in Minaki.  We have had the worst/coldest/wettest/snowiest May in 97 years (Thanks to Todd S for the statistic).    The highlight of the weekend was putting our new canoe in the water.  We had a great time paddling, although Oliver was a bit bored.  It is so great to be out on the water, venturing close enough to shore to explore.  We also worked hard on the trail maintenance and clearing an area for Oliver's new fort/treehouse, which hopefully will be complete in the next week or so.    Sunday was very rainy and chilly, and we had a nice day, just hanging out inside.  For the first year, Oliver demonstrated an ability to entertain himself a bit and was able to handle being cooped up inside, reading, working puzzles, working on art projects and drinking copious amounts of hot cocoa.  This is such a huge component of why we live in Winnipeg.  While we really enjoy Winnipeg and have made so many friends and feel it is such a great environment in which to raise a child, being able to go to the lake for summer weekends makes those spring snowstorms tolerable.  No television, email, voicemail, or other daily interruptions.  Time to focus on family and what is really important.    Nice weekend!  More to come.

      When my niece, Taylor, was about 7 or 8, she told me that she was intimidated by chapter books.  My response was that if she was able to use the word "intimidated" correctly, chapter books shouldn't pose a problem.    Last night, Oliver and I started reading his first "chapter book" ever - one without pictures.  We read the first chapter of the 3rd Harry Potter book and, except for a few sidebars regarding the definition of such terms as "luminous" and "untrustworthy," he really enjoyed it and seemed to understand it!    One day, he won't need me to read to him, and that will be so sad.

          We had a fabulous day fishing yesterday!  After working for 2 days cleaning around and under the cottage, we set out on a fishing trip - 2 dozen minnows and our new fishing equipment (new because the old stuff was stolen).  Within 45 minutes, we had 8 fish in the live well and had thrown many back.  Oliver was busy with his snack and just being a 4-year old in general, and wasn't really paying that much attention to fishing.  He started saying "Something's pulling on my line!" so we just told him to reel it in, thinking it probably wasn't a fish.  And he was right!  His Doe Doe will be proud!

After the obligatory photo shoot and long discussions about why we couldn't keep him, Marcelo and Oliver rescued the turtle and delivered him back to the shoreline.  A few hours later, when Jason and Frannie were leaving, we discovered that the turtle had climbed the rocky cliff yet again!  This time we let him go on his merry way.

      Will the weather ever improve?  Seven weekends in a row it has rained in Minaki.  No treehouse yet, although Robbie committed last night to having it built before July 16.  Regardless, we were still able to enjoy ourselves.  On Saturday, Uncle Todd took us on a lovely fishing expedition.  We managed to catch enough for lunch and Todd orchestrated a very delicious non-Atkins lunch of fried fish (dipped in corn flakes - he is so domestic!), fried potatoes (or "grease nuggets" as Liz and Mike lovingly call them) and pork & beans.  Yummy!!  Since Marcelo's 39th birthday was on Sunday, July 4, we had a party for him on Saturday night.  We had a few friends over and had a wonderful time.  It was so great to hang out with friends at the cottage, and the weather held out nicely so we didn't melt like we have in the past.

      This guy was fantastic  urlLink His site      I tease Marcelo about having a crush on Jackie Green, but the truth is, the guy is fabulous.&nbsp; He is very young and very talented.&nbsp; And he makes "mirror" rhyme with "hear" in the most lovely way.&nbsp; He even inspired Oliver to get his own harmonica!

         We had a fabulous time at the 31st Annual Winnipeg Folk Fest.  On Friday night, we heard the Buena Vista Social Club, Utah Phillips, Joel Kroeker and the Duhks.  On Saturday, we spent the entire day at the festival and in between visits to the childrens stage (where Oliver enjoyed lots of signing and dancing), we had the opportunity to hear Joel Kroeker again, as well as The Wailin' Jennys, Girlyman, and Marcelo's new favorite musician, Jackie Greene.  Fabulous singer-songwriter, great guitar and harmonica player - blew everyone away.  We had gorgeous weather and managed not to get sunburned and we saw many old friends and enjoyed a wide range of food.

       &nbsp; This is our friend and the best hairdresser in the world, ML Kenneth.&nbsp; I have been going to her since we first moved here in 2000 and she now takes very good care of Oliver as well!&nbsp; Poor Marcelo, still getting sheared in the kitchen while his family enjoys regular salon visits.

      Folklorama is a two-week long event held in Winnipeg where local groups host pavilions to celebrate their heritage.  Oliver very badly wanted to go to the Russian pavilion, along with hundreds of others.  He hated the food, but enjoyed the dancing and the costumes.
