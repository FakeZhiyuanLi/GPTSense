       The poem written below is so sappy, I laughed when I read it today.  Haha!  Random thoughts lately: 1. When watching mice in our experimental animal facility, I've noticed that all they ever do is... (a) eat, (b) copulate, (c) fight.  Which, to me, represents the animalistic side of life... or the Lockean state of nature.  For mice, it's just that simple.  I'm glad that for us, there's more to this life than living and dying, more than just trying to make it though the day (SC Chapman).  2. Male mice force female mice to copulate, and females always run away at first.  Why isn't it the other way around, like, females going after the males? And why don't they both go after each other?  Does it physically hurt the females or what? Hmmm?  3.  The pre-believers in my lab exhibit some similar traits: (a) they swear a lot, (b) they're not truly/madly/deeply loving to one another, (c) and they lie casually.  Part (c) is what completely throws me off because I assume people are always telling me the truth, but they lie about the darndest stuff.  4.  I have this feeling that God is going to do something amazing at my company.  He's placed faithful believers in key areas of the Institute.  We have a believers in maintenance, finance, and dispersed throughout the labs.  Sweet!  5.  Even though I need to use mice for my experiments, I never want to lose compassion for them.  It's easy to do that in this job, and numbing oneself to their pain makes the job easier.  But, I don't want to harden my heart to them ever.  I will definitely do my job well, but I always want to hurt when they hurt.

       Using scripture to steal...  I coworker shared about a family member using Paul's reference of performing good works to take his stuff, like clothes.  They looked back at the scripture about turning the other cheek and giving clothes to those in need to justify taking stuff from my coworkers house.  This was my letter to him later that day:  "Done with business, onto fellowship today.  I felt that your brother using scripture to take things from you stems not from the scripture itself, but your relationship with him.  Perhaps that is the heart of the matter, in the sense that there may be unresolved issues/ hurts/ bitterness from the past.  It's hard to imagine someone using a passage that clearly encourages love as a tool for greed and right out theft except if the scripture is not the issue on hand.  Or perhaps I'm speaking out of place, since I know nothing about your relationship with your brother except for the few words you said today.    Nevertheless, I feel that our witness and relationship with others can be so loving.  I know I'm young and idealistic (and naive), but I'd like people to look at me beyond a "not bad" person and see Christ by our passion/ caring/ love for other brothers and for the lost.  For me, it's not enough for people to not see me as evil, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  The rest is showering them with love.  Most importantly, I write this letter as a word of encouragement because of your heart for your family.  They will be in my prayers as well.  It's a blessing for us to have fellowship like we do every once in a while.  Thank you for your questions and wisdom, my brother.  With you eternally, David An

       Talk is cheap... Two weeks ago I was convicted that talk was cheap.  I had watched a video evangelist speak so eloquently to a group of stoic old people.  He said so many intellectually deep and challenging things, it was hard to take notes of the concepts... which made me realize that it became worthless.  Okay, so worthless is an extreme word to use.  Let's say it became cheapened.  The contrast is my experience in a charismatic church called Shiloh, where a former drug dealer turned pastor spoke about seeking the Lord in the most basic and pure way.  I still remember this sermon from 3 months ago over the video intellectual from 3 weeks ago.  He spoke the word of truth through our circumstances that was so real to us we could taste it.  It was so meaningful, and we were moved to love others as we grew more and more sensitive to the Holy Spirit that night.  So, I conclude that talk is cheap.  Or, more-so, intellectual jargon and mere concepts.  To love others deeply and to seek the Lord unswervingly stems from a passion that moves beyond mere words.  As I heard those intellectual words echo through the silent room that day, I realized that God was moving in a different and real was in our hearts.  So I'm going to quit talking, and start loving and seeking wholeheartedly.  Talk is cheap.

       The Echo... The concept that our prayers are an echo of God's desire.  This was tough for me to grasp last night as Samantha went on her monologue describing the Echo.  This applied to our "shady" prayer requests such as requests that we feel to be selfish.  But perhaps our prayers are God's desires that He is leading us to ask, which is completely in line with His plans and will.  The example last night was praying for someone else's girlfriend/boyfriend, which I'm 100% against doing.  But the idea was that maybe God wants us to ask for things we truly desire, so that He can guide our path and will through the process of seeking.  Even if what we desire is shady, such as someone else's girlfriend.  That in the end He will work through our prayers so that His plans are done.  Hmmm.   I'm still thinking about this one.  But the echo concept sounds amazing.  So I immediately asked Daniel to back it up scripturally, so he referred to Hannah and Samuel's story where she offered to give God her son if God would give her a son.  God did.  She did.  Samuel, one of the greatest prophets was born.  God wanted her to ask Him for something that seemed selfish so that His will would be done.  Amazing...  ~David An

       Lost mouse tail & spleen on the ground...  I snipped small parts of tail off of 49 anesthetized mice yesterday for pcr.  Then, on my way back to the lab, I dropped all of the tubes on the ground.  Luckily they all had snap tops to secure the tail in the tube.  So I looked so strange crawling around on my hands and knees with my face to the ground trying to find a piece of tail.  When people walked by, I'd kneel upright to look more "normal."  Hmmm, sad.  This morning I came at 7 and accidentally caused post doc to drop spleen.  But gotta go.

       Her splinter, my plank  Sat down last night with Christian sister S-- and looked at her resume.  I wanted to help her find a job, which necessitates her knowing God's calling/direction, and motivation.  There wasn't much of either, which made the atmosphere heavy and intimidating.  I was trying to make it lighthearted, but it was one of those deeper/serious issues in life.  But you have to know where I'm coming from...   I have detailed plans for the rest of my life: immuno research next yr or two, M Div from seminary within that time, med school following, meet girl 1st yr med school, married 2nd yr of med school, adopt 3 kids (Hispanic, Af Am, Cauc.), named 4 of my kids (Ester, Cherish, Emmanual, David [after King David]), med missions for several years in China, S. Africa, E Europe, Kosovo.  Retire from med and go into mission field again, where I will pass away.  Detailed eh?  Proverbs: In his heart a man makes his plans, but God directs his path.  Above list is all of my narrow-minded/short-sighted plans.  Especially about meeting the girl in 1st yr med, yeah right I  have any control over that.  So, according to my personality type, I didn't really understand what the problem was.  Why didn't she have it all worked out.  Well, rarely are people as psychotic as myself.  Plus, there is an important lesson for me to learn in all of this.  You see, I cannot budget for the life of me.  I make good money but it disappears miraculously.  I owe people big time, as well.  What the heck!  I don't excessively shop or even go to movies for that matter.  But my sister talks to me with the same tone of voice like I talked to S-- last night.  My sister is a master budgeter.  She can't understand my irresponsibility.  I become a whipped puppy when my sister trashes my financial irresponsibility.  So... as S-- was, so am I.    Last night after coming to this realization, I sat down and wrote down a budget for the first time.  Amazingly my next paycheck disappeared into the redline and expenses owed instantly.  But at least I get to see it before it happened this time, instead of as it's happening.  Though really, I've learned to be more responsible because I've seen my own inadequacy, which makes me more compassionate and understanding when it comes to helping S-- for she is a dear sister to me.

       Human dissection = calling ex.  Almost exactly six months ago I told my ex that we shouldn't call/talk/email/see each other for 6 months so that I could love her as a friend.  I thought it would be enough time.  Plus, she had a new boyfriend so this was a wise decision.  I actually got the idea from A--, a friend from church who tried the same with a guy she had a crush on and it worked for her.  So I gave it a shot.  Six months later was 2 days ago.  Up until that time I was terrified of that day... her birthday, which was the day I promised to call her.  I sent a short/surfacy emails to test the waters and finally gave her a call after praying with non-Christian friends (figured it would be good witness to pray with them).  We talked briefly, I was amazingly calm. It was cool.  We talked more the next day, and that's when I started to get that strange and familiar tug on my heart.  Two strange things she asked me were: "Does this feel strange?" Response: "No." and "Are you mad at me?" Response: "No."  Didn't know why she would think I was mad at her.  Yes, I've been frustrated with her in the past sometimes, but never mad at her.  I don't really get that mad at people in general.  In the three years that we dated, we only argued once on move-out day sophomore year.  Then we hugged/apologized/made up minutes later.  All in all, it was a good conversation, except I have this thing where I need a Christian brother in the room with me when I talk to her so I don't get weird, you know.  But this experience totally reminds me of the time I took at human dissection course at Beijing Medical University.  I've always wanted to be a doctor, but I've only guessed how I'd respond after seeing my first cadaver.  It's one of those things you don't know until it happens to you.  Would I cry? Throw up? Freak out? Eat it (haha!)?  When I saw the cadaver, I was curious, calm, and completely alright as I examined the neural network.  Which reminds of how my talks with Jenn have been... a big mystery, but ultimately good.

       Flying Buddha  Very very disappointed to find a jade buddha of wealth in my mom's room yesterday when I visited.  I told her that I was taking it.  Then I called later to make sure she was ok with me taking it away.  After she said I could have it, I rolled down the window while driving 50 MPH near a canyon and hurled it out the window.  I totally didn't try to do this, but a roadsign was coming up at the last second and the idol smashed into it!  It broke into pieces and made a huge bang!!! Cool!  For those who may think I'm harsh, disrespectful, or extreme, you're right.  Especially when it comes to idolatory.  There are too many times in the OT when people stray from Him, and it is always bad.  But I sat down with my mom the next night and gently shared my reasons for taking her Buddha.  I spoke with truth, and love, as I would to my child, since this issue will inevitably surface in the future.

       Quick summary of the trip so far.  My sister refers to it as the "Mary and David Roadtrip of Joy."  Started in SD on June 22, drove to Utah (BYU) to visit cousin, then to Yosemite (2 misdemeanors, funny story), then slept at a rest stop before visiting Jenny Wu in Minneapolis, then visited Taryn Okuma in Madison, then Tina Yang and uncle in Chicago, then saw Lisa Hsu in Ann Arbor, crossed through Canada (busted again), and arrived in Vermont, then drove to Boston, and trained here.  It's been so much fun, though my sister became a little irritable on the last day.  Busted in Yosemite for illegally swimming in a hot spring called "boiling river" where nerve-destroying thermophilic amoeba live. They enter through the head, so we just had to keep head out of water.  How we got busted by the rangers is a really funny story that I must share personally.  Crossed the border of Canada without a passport, and into sars country.  Canadian border patrol were unhappy that we didn't have proper ID, so these swat team like officers searched our car in detail.  We were really scared.  Now I'm in DC and on my own... pretending he's beside me... all alone, I walk with him 'til morning.  :)  All is well, and I'm meeting great people and having so much fun.  Next steps are intense Foreign Service interview, breakfast with Feinstein, NY fun with Wes Che, and exploring Boston with some random family friends that I've never met before.

       Writing from the Library of Congress in DC.  This place is beautiful.  It's been a dream of mine to just spend a week here studying in the Main Reading Room. It's breathtaking.  Just arrived on a night train this morning from Boston.

       Looking back at my blogs, it seems that I post once in forever.  Since it's been a while, and all of my supervisors are away from the office, I think I'll write a little update.  I'm currently writing from US Senator Dianne Feinstein's office, where I handle Energy and National Security-related legislation.  Basically, I research and call departments in the government.  The Energy legislation is ongoing, where I'm focusing on future LNG (Liguid natural gas) port safety concerns.  DF is coming to town in 8 days, exciting stuff.  I need to take more pipictures with her, Vons messed up my film with her in DC when we had brunch with staff.  But, I'm going back to school next month at UCSD.  I was accepted to the MA in International Politics and Business starting next month!  That school is going to be my new playground.  It'll be fun.  Climbed Mt. St. Helens recently.  That was "pretty neat."  Started the ascent at 4 AM and summitted at noon.  Going to volunteer at an orphanage in Mexico for 3 days/ 2 nights on August 22nd.  Going to Bay Area for IV Super-senior retreat in Tahoe on Sept 1.

       Savannah, of all places...  Guess where I'm writing from?  Georgia!  It's like day 6 of my roadtrip with sister.  The first two days were spent in NY with friends, at the UN plaza sipping cocktails, walking through PS1 (contemporary art space), and checking out the Village.  Good times, good times.  Went to DC after that, familiar ground (3rd time in past year).  Then off through Delaware, Maryland, to Virginia and hung out at Virginia Beach for a night.  Then through Williamsburg, North Carolina, spent night at Chaleston, and now in Georgia.   We'll probably skip Miami, Key West, Bahamas because I only have 5 days to get back to SD for orientation.  Possibly straight through to New Orleans by tonight.  My sister and I bought matching straw cowboy hats, which attracts a lot of attention when we wear it.  I'm also sporting a bandana at the moment, much like the one Ken wore but black.  Roadtripping with sister can be tough, she becomes less than civil after a while.

       Summer plans at State, GS-5 pay!  For the non-DC insiders, State refers to the US Dept of State (DOC = commerce, the fund = IMF, the bank = world bank, etc.)  Ok, I sound pompous so I'll quit it.  Anyways, 3 weeks ago I get a call from EAP (Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs) Director at State saying that I'm one out of four final candidates out of 3 dozen.  Then a week later and after a few more interviews I find out that I am the one person they selected for the paid internship!  Specifically, I will be at the Office Regional Security.  EAP is the umbrella group for all of the Embassies/Consulates along the East Asia and Pacific, which shuffles diplomats and formulates policy.  Exciting!  They say that I have a few tasks, some security related and some economic.  For instance, I'm supposed to help coordinate the ASEAN conference held in Indonesia this year.  ASEAN is the SE Asian counterpart to NAFTA (N. Atlantic Free Trade Agreement) and Mercosur.  My friend Solomon from UCSD will be working on ASEAN from the US Embassy in Indonesia, so I'm excited that we'll be working together on this from HQ and the field.    Then, I will plan "regional dialogues" among foreign officials on the topic of nuclear proliferation, threat of war, which is the security aspect.  This is interesting/exciting since my office oversees China - Taiwan concerns, N. Korea nuclear issues, etc.  Ok, this blog is far too political. But I love this stuff.  It's the reason I left medicine and bio research.  Ironically, I'm currently at TA for undergrad neurobiology even though I'm a Poli Sci grad student.  It kinda fits, I guess...  ~D.An

       Going back to Cal in 3 weeks. 2/12 morning to 2/15!  Posting this for my friend Lisa at U of M who complained that my previous post was too old... and especially for my great Cal IV bros/sisters who keep in touch thru blog.  I can't wait to see my IV friends in a few weeks!  Of course, much of the hanging out will be at Tina's mansion, where Liz, Lisa, and Cindy (half time) live.  Brother Ryan has been nice enough to offer to pick me up... little does he know it's early Tues morning at like 9 something AM, but then there's always AirBart.  There's a really cool Asian Business Convention in SF that weekend, which I hope to attend.  Recruiters from the private sector are there to look for bilingual Chinese/English candidates and I figure it's a great opportunity to network.  But, there's another really AMAZING reason I'm going up that weekend... with a one way ticket.  My former roommate Greg Hulse is has just left to Beijing and he let me borrow his big Harley for 1/2 a year!  I'm riding down 101 baby!  I really pray that it doesn't rain, seeing as I actually don't know how to ride a motorcycle.  But I figure I have a few days in the Bay to figure it out before my big trip.  I'm stoked!  I got a sweet helmet, padded motorcycle jacket, goggles, and CHAPS... haha :).  It's gonna be great.  Understandably, my mom isn't as excited about this as I am, nor are the other women in my life.  But the guys all think it will be cool.  ~D.An

       Yosemite taught me real fear for unreal danger.    I spent 4 days out in the wild, away from people, and I was truly afraid that some bear would maul us or that I would be assaulted by some madman.  Those are the unreal dangers.  But really, I am terribly afraid of situations outside of my control or familiarity.  Specifically, the wilderness.  My reaction was to press on and try to solve problems on my own.  If I had to cross a freezing river with my heavy internal frame backpack, I would strategize and go.  When we were lost in the snow covered 7000+ ft wilderness before dusk I raced around to try to find the snow covered trail, without success.  The whole trip was about me fighting my fears and vulnerabilities... which was tremendously sad because it ignores the one who holds our fears in His hands.   As I drove out of the wilderness on the 4th day, tears streamed down my face.    In my daily urban lifestyle, I solve problems and avoid danger on my own while attributing everything to God's plan.  Is it really God's plan if I lived by my own wits?  When I rely on my own gifts, I still testify to His work in my life, but is it really Him or me?  The wilderness answered this questions and truly tested me, and found me lacking.  It is this realization that brought me to tears.  I felt that I was tested, but failed.  I was filled with grief that when I dug deep within myself when I was seriously challenged instead of dropped on my knees where I belong.  I belong in submission to Him so that my life can truly be a testimony of His work.

       Asia SF + Velvet Lounge = no good.  Tonight we went out to Asia SF and then the Velvet Lounge.  Asia SF was this little basement a little bigger than Alb's condo.  It was no good.  I had high expectations, given that I am Asian and all.  The music was this shrieking techno, and the people were lame.  After 10 minutes, I booked it out of there.  Luckily, there was no cover.  Then we moved on to Velvet Lounge.  It, too, was no good.  I really had high expectations for the place.  (A) because if I have to pay a $10 cover it can't be that bad.  I was wrong.  (B) Johnny Knoxville from Jackass chills at the LA Velvet Lounge.  Johnny Knoxville is cool.  The people at the SF Velvet Lounge were cooler than that Asia SF crowd, but not as cool as Johnny Knoxville.  I made the best of it, put down a Heineken, and danced the night away.    Now it's 3:30 AM and I'm blogging to share this misadventure with you all.  Or as former roommate Andrew Hsia would put it: "Y'all!"  Even "On Broadway" in SD is better than these places.   Next time I'm going out with Jerm, who took us to the upscale Starlight Lounge at the St. Francis Hotel (or Francis Drake?) overlooking Union Square.  That was quality.  Actually, next time is tomorrow night when I will be out with him and a non-Nicky girl after my cooking gig.

       Mission District + past hurt and comfort  First time chillin' at the Mission District in SF today.  It was alright, but I like Castro better... cooler men's clothing stores.  We found a great Mediterranean place and got schwarma.  I had to sacrifice a $2 pint place (your choice of beer), though, but the Meditarranean place was a hole in the wall with cheap awesome Greek food.  (Too many adjectives in the last sentence.)  -----  I decided to spike my hair today into large 1.5 inch pyramids, inspired by my roommate Ben.    -----  Danny and I are talking more and more about the joint business idea.  It's a lot of fun to brainstorm.  He's one of the few brothers I'd fully trust in a venture like this, but it will be hard when I leave SF.  -----  The love songs DJ on KOIT was comforting a broken man today on the radio.  It reminded me of when I was really sad and missing my girlfriend of 4 years after our breakup.  I naively thought that life could not go on.  During that time, the strangest thing happened one day while I was returning to Berkeley from a day of research at NASA Ames.  Everyone noticed that I was melancholy and barely ate, and a two Berkeley astrophysics professors tried to comfort me.    Hoping to gain wisdom,  I asked them if they've ever been hurt after a relationship ended and how they overcame the sadness.  One shared, "I loved her, but my wife was an alcoholic.  One day I asked her to choose: me, or the alcohol.  She chose the alcohol and left.  I never saw her again."  What the!!!  Madness.  Already my troubles were starting to seem trivial relative to this kind of trauma.    Minutes later, the other professor confessed, "I also really loved my wife, but she got involved with a cult.  I found out that she slept with the cult leader.  Then she left me to be with the cult."  What the!!!  Madness, again.    I didn't have problems, THEY had problems.  My self pity was as bad as being prideful, but just in the opposite sense.  What seemed to be my overwhelming pain was not that difficult compared to others.  They're old.  They survived.  Maybe life would go on after all. It has, praise God!  -----  I thank Him for his blessings everyday... even if people think I look like a punk on the outside.  Speaking of being a punk, street people are actually a lot nicer to you when you look like a rebel.  They're either intimidated, or they feel like you're one of them.  Haha!

       Today was even more uneventful.  I pulled an all-nighter for the first time last night for helping some UCSD Chinese friends edit, suggest, and revamp their essays. Believe me, their essays needed a lot of work.  The friend who asked me to help was a good friend of mine, like a brother to me, so how could I refuse?  The three papers were a 6 page soundscape, 6 page sociology Maxim / Cosmopolitan essay, and 3 pages on art topics.  It took forever, and they were due today so I worked on it until 5 AM when the sun was coming out.  It's my first all-nighter, and it wasn't even for my own classes!  If it were for myself, I think I wouldn't have worked as hard... which is bad.  I decided to give the Cosmo to Alb as a gift for letting me stay over.  He'll probably say "whatever..." and toss it on my bags, haha, Bobe.    I was joking about Danny becoming a motorcycle racer, so I deleted it altogether.  Inside joke.  It would be cool, though, if he was.  Just researched all day today for the essays and went swimming + jacuzzi!  All by myself, sad. :(  But good, 'cause I get to pray and spend time with God then.  I watched this guy at Berkeley's Hearst Pool do a mellow version of the butterfly a while ago.  I'm working on it and it's looking good.  Now I can go fly non-stop for like 75 meters.  Then I resort to my freestyle and breast, my competition strokes in high school.

       Uneventful day + shaving  Today was a normal day, nothing too exciting to share.  I edited the sound structure essay for a UCSD friend this morning.  Then Lisa and I went to watch Harry Potter at the huge screen IMAX in the Metreon SF.  Tickets were $15.50 each and it wasn't that much greater than a regular theater.  Lisa really loved the movie, since she read all the books.  I'm a little less into children's fantasy, but I ate so much buttered popcorn and snickers there, nice.  I got home late and spontaneously decided to shave most of my body.  After talking to Albert for a bit, I disappeared into the bathroom and started on my arms.  I rarely do this, but I just feel more clean cut when my body hair is managed. It all started with that ridiculous body building tournament story when I was first forced to shave it all, but that's a whole other chapter in my life.  Ok, I wasn't forced, but I thought it would be funny if I did it.  I feel that it's best to dry shave with the grain (not against), so the hair doesn't clog up my razor as easily.  The first time I shaved at the tournament was with wet nair all over my body, and I could only get a square inch at a time.  How slow and annoying it was then, plus I nicked a nipple and also had blood running down my legs.  Hey, it was my first time :(.  Also, please pray for Jenn H as she recovers from her running / repetitive stress injuries.  I think Jenn is very focused, disciplined, and determined, which gets her good grades but also repetitive stress injuries.  I don't think I'll ever suffer from those because I'm too easily distracted.  I'll never get carpal tunnel because I type for a few minutes, get up and wander around, and repeat throughout the day.  It wastes a lot of my time, though.  I don't think I have glasses because I just read / study for half an hour at a time and then do other stuff like guitar / exercise / swim / cook.  It's hard for me to sit still for too long, making lack of discipline my downfall that apparently has it's advantages.  Haha!

       Filet Mignon, Hors d'oeurves...  Today we cooked for biotech execs at the SF MOMA (Museum of Modern Art).  It was really classy, and we made the best food.    Lisa and I worked on the hors d'oeurves and made (1) dungeness crab (mixed with lemon butter sauce, plus fresh lemon juice) in a fresh endive leaf sprinkled with parsley and topped with a line of caviar; (2) duck foie gras on a criscrossed potato crisp; (3) baked scallop skewers; (4) goat cheese, with a dab of honey to secure a whole roasted almond, and then a dab of honey to secure the colorful flower garnish on top of the almond; plus 2 more.  Before the main dish was an "intermezzo" of sorbet with blackberry and mint garnish.  The main dish was hectic, as we worked to get filet mignon, skewered prawns, asparagus, and golden potatoes out.  Dessert was chocolate cake drizzled with raspberry sauce around the plate, with whole raspberries placed strategically.  ---------  Aside from that, I'm helping some UCSD friends out with 3 final exam essays this week.  I'm super stressed.  The essays are on art, sociology, and movie soundscapes and essays need a lot of work!  I also need to check up on that security clearance that I still don't have from the State Dept.  I've decided to still go to DC on June 18th regardless because I feel that is leading me there and that He will provide.

       "I'm just a cook" (Under Siege)  Steven Seagal says, "I'm just a cook,"  right before single-handedly killing a group of terrorists that have taken his navy ship hostage.  Non-sequitur...  What to do in SF between my Masters in Int'l Politics and my summer research position with the State Dept?  I like cooking.  I always wanted to be a chef.  Why not just work as a cook?  After being brutally rejected by several local French restaurants, I was finally hired part time by Global Gourmet catering.  This was a month and a half ago.  The excitement begins.  Tonight we cooked for literally 3000 people at the Genentech Bio Conference.  I was the "mu-shu chicken" guy, responsible for wok frying bins of chicken.  I worked 2 woks simultaneously.  First boiled the oil, then added ginger and garlic, then chicken, vegetables (with water to steam), and Mu-Shu black bean sauce.  It was crazy with waiters in the "front house" hounding me for food.  I literally made 40 pounds of mu-shu over 7.5 hours.  The brocolli was tricky because it took longer to soften.  It was high stress and fun!    As "back house," people treat me like I'm in culinary school and under-educated.  Most of the other cooks never attended college and this is their trade.  It's understandable that our bosses and clients can easily look down on us because they're I-Bankers and we're cooks.  That's what I love!  I love that excitement of experiencing something new, even if it's a whole different identity in which people have a very narrow-minded view of who I am.  In the kitchen, my knowledge of international politics and strategy doesn't matter; nor anyone care about my business degree, molecular biology bachelors, work in the Embassy, or student leadership.    It's like I'm a living William Faulkner novel, where the narrative changes as the perspectives of his characters shift.  Even so, these days, I'm just a cook.

       A particular verse that has been on my heart since my QT yesterday has been 2 Tim 2:11...  11Here is a trustworthy saying:     If we died with him,         we will also live with him;      12if we endure,         we will also reign with him.     If we disown him,         he will also disown us;      13if we are faithless,         he will remain faithful,         for he cannot disown himself.   In particular, I struggled with the last two verses because they seem so contradictory at face value.  If we disown him, he will disown us; but if we are faithless, he will still remain faithful!?  It would make more superficial sense if disowning was mutual along with faithlessness or vice versa, but it's not.  I realized that it's because of the issue of ownership, which is so different than faithfulness.  The difference between the two concepts is what Hosea is all about when he married an unfaithful wife as an analogy to Israel's rebellion.  Hosea continued to love her because she belonged to him.  Just like that, I see how God loves us no matter what.  I claim to be an imperfect Christian, lacking in my faith and challenged by sins often.  However, God's ownership over me is something I can never deny.  Therefore, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself for I belong to Him and He is a part of me (or within, or completely...).  This is profound because the heart of my struggles are often how I project a view myself in my rebellion translated into God's disapproval of me.  I couldn't have been more wrong.

       Half Moon Bay Beckons  Danny came up with this great idea to camp out in his van on the beach last night.  It was great... most of the time.  We went to Fisherman's Whart together that evening and ate crab ($14 for a the biggest one, but a little undercooked), then shared a banana split romantically in Ghirardelli Square, then off to Half Moon Bay.  (Note: I like to hang out at the Castro, but unlike a pendulum I don't swing both ways; unfortunate for Danny's schemes)  At Half moon Bay we found a nice spot near the beach and walked around at 1 AM briefly before we slept.  I was tired by then, and tossed and turned a bit before falling asleep.  Next thing I know the sun is up and Danny is chilling in the car trying to get me up.  It was 6:45 AM!  What the heck, I was still so tired, so I laid there like a log as he bummed around.  It was steamy in the van and we felt unclean when we woke up, but at least his legs weren't wrapped around me or anything.  Haha!  He gave up on getting me to move so he just drove off with me still sleeping in the back.  Then I finally got up to eat at Burger King.  After that we went to the Ritz Carlton there, and came up with this business idea where we would market cool stuff.  I'm a thinker / strategizer, and he is a do-er, so I figure it will work out perfectly.  Earlier we talked about buying a house together to get our foot into the real estate door.  First start the business, then buy a house together, then we'll get married and have kids... so the joke goes.  We ended our adventure with worship at a cemetary.  We both busted out our guitars and chilled at empty gravesites and jammed for a while.  It was sweet.  After that, he left for worship practice and I left to meet some FICB people for dinner in Daly City.

       Biggest crab ever!  I'm a Fisherman's Wharf self-declared crab connoisseur.  Today I went and asked for the biggest Dungeness crab they have.  In the past I've only had $14 dollar large crabs ($8.95 / lb), usually in the middle of a Berkeley Physiology class that was easily ditchable.  But today they went to secret reserve bin and pulled out a $21 behemoth!  It was so huge and cool!  After a boiling and a good smashing, there was so much meat.  It was maximum meat for the same effort!  Nice, nice.

       Malachi on my mind.  "For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My name will be great among the nations.  (Malachi 1:11)."  The imagery behind the rising and setting sun is so powerful and beautiful.  It only serves as a glimpse of God's true power and glory.  Amazing!   -----  "My covenant with him (Levi) was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me, and stood in awe of My name.  True instruction was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found on his lips, he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity."  (Malachi 2:5-6)    Above reproach.  I admire the description of the Levite's faith so much.  Josh Chien used to train GMG (Godly Men's Group, high school) to be above reproach.  It had stuck with me since, but in many ways it contradicts a lot of the craziness in my life and in the previous blogs.  Being exposed to the harsh world is like playing "hardball."  It takes real heart preparation, and a strong walk with God.  When I'm not careful, it easily enflames a battle that rages within.  -----  "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statues, and have not kept them.  Return to Me, and I will return to you." (Malachi 3:7)  The last line blows me away, for His mercy is so great... and his arms are open to receive.

       I love my sister so much!  Mary just returned to SD from Guadalajara today after 4 months in Central America, mostly Guatemala and Honduras.  I would give anything to sit down with her at our favorite coffee shop in La Jolla and just share adventures until late early in the morning.  She has much wilder one's than me.  She's wild, in general.  I'm so proud of her.  It's ok, we're planning on hanging out in New York or Vermont in a few weeks.    As an illustration of her life, here's a taste of her day so far.  She was fine all of the time alone in Central America, only to return to the US and find a man masturbating at her on the empty trolly car.  She was furious and just told him how pathetic he was.  I feel sorry for the guy who tries to take advantage of her, she's not the kind of girl to mess with.  I'm so proud of her.    -----  My naysaying backfired!  Ok, so I'm often a naysayer to my closest friends because it can be funnier to see them devastated, in a good joking way (if that's possible).  One of my closest friends had a rough breakup with his ex a while ago, followed by a lot of drama.  We were told over dinner that she was going to his house today.  He ate less, and his anxiety was so intense his eyes were glazed over.  I was making fun of him all night, but I had decided to protect my brother as his "wingman" tonight.  I was so amused at his misfortune, and totally deserve what happened next.    We go back to his place and see his ex.  Then from the livingroom comes MY ex (the one from the June 11th story of trauma).  What the?!  I thought she was 500+ to 2000+ miles away!  The wingman was going down in flames... it was an ambush for the both of us.  I was surprised, shocked, and taken aback for a few minutes.  Then it was fine... actually it was great.  Over the months, my rose-colored glasses had slipped off and she was just an old friend again.  Sa-weet!  But I hear that she's dating again and I wish her the very best!         -----  Choir boys with British accents  We went to watch my little cousin Michael sing in a boys choir today.  They were so cute!  It was, like, all falsetto.  Cool!

       Rouge + Jeff from LSF  Today I woke up at noon, watched a movie "The One" with good ol' Albert and talked / joked / made fun of it the whole time like we always did back in high school / college.  It felt like great times again!  Then I rushed off to work, and cooked for a wedding.  NY Strip steak was on the menu, along with other hard to pronounce French words.  Tonight, we used lemon aioli (sauce) to top the crab cakes.  My cooking partner Matt (culinary grad) mentioned that it is also used to top empanadas, which was on my mind since reading Annie Tran's blog about her empanada lunch.  I asked him what they were, and he said they were like apple turnovers with meat instead of apple.  Being a carnivore, I thought: Hook it up!  It also unraveled the mystery behind Annie's empanada story.  My eight hour shift ended at 11:30 pm, and immediately Jerm and Niki picked us up to go clubbing at the Rouge.  It didn't end up being a non-Niki girl after all (inside joke).  There were a total of 7 of us there: Me, Lisa (IV), Tina Chiang (IV), Merm, Niki, Jeff (LSF), and Jeff's friend.  Going with a big group made it infinitely better than last nights experience.  Unfortunately, cover was $20 a person.  But you really get what you pay for, and this place was nice.  There were 3 simulataneous bachelorette parties happening, and the place was mainly full of wild girls dancing on the bar... which is enough to make Ken Kong jealous that he didn't come :).  We had a great time, but the best part was spending time to get to know our friends in a different context (ex. dancing with Tina, slight drama with Lisa, dancing with some random bachelorette (causing slight drama), letting Jerm turn my shirt into a bikini top while people stuffed cash into my pants as I danced).  But on a deeper interpersonal level, I'll explain...  I've been impressed with Jeff (half Korean, half white) ever since I met him.  At first, I think it was his confidence, sincerity, supportiveness of others, and faith in the Lord.  I sensed those things about him right off.  Plus he's super athletic.  Over time, I've found that we have similar tastes: We split a bottle of Mondavi cabernet sauvignon (our favorite) in Napa, we dress similarly, and he sipped Jack Daniels tonight in a cognac glass (which I would do).  Only, I feel that in all of these things mentioned above, he's a step ahead of me.  That's why even though I rarely hang out with him (total of 4 times), I admire him a lot.  Disclaimer:  I include the antics and details in my life and stopped being afraid of what my friends think.  Even so, all of the craziness at the club was really just superficial "razzle dazzle."  The best moments were the experiences of being goofy together, as brothers and sisters.  There may be those who will read my stories and scoff.  I don't need to write this stuff, it could just be about sunshine and butterflies in my walk with the Lord.  I just feel that I get so much judgemental, conservative flack from my Christian friends, which is ironic because I used to be so uptight and critical of anything "worldly."  I've come to realize that it's always easier to stand on the side and shake our heads, yet harder to truly live in the world... but not of it.  I've since stopped isolating and insulating myself, and that has been the most powerful witness of all.

       In San Diego  My plans for dC had suddenly changed after talking with Ryan last week.  He shared some advice to go home and let God open and close doors without forcing it myself.  Returning to SD would be a financially wise decision.    It has been several days since I've last blogged.  Since then, I've fixed up my room in SD (wallpaper border, 2 wall mount shelves, new lighting, plants, curtains) and it looks much more homey than before.  I'm planning to find some temp work until my clearance comes through, which they say should be soon.  If not, they have offered me the same position in DC for January to March if I choose to take more time away from school.  All is well.  It's nice to see old friends in SD, and to binge on carne asada burritos on a daily basis.

       Heavenly Man  It has been a while since I've posted, so I'll try to include pics above of what's been happening.  I went to the "Heavenly Man" testimony revival of Brother Yun over the past 2 days.  He had amazing testimonies of fasting for 70 days or miraculously escaping from jail in China.  It was easy for me to be skeptical of his claims on an intellectual level until he prayed for me.  He asked us to kneel down as he placed his hands on Ben and my head.  I experienced his passion for the Lord and a contagious fire in his heart as he spoke.  I still don't know if the outlandish claims in his book are true, but I was impacted and changed.  No matter what, his book is an encouragement to me and what helped make me depressed last night.  ----  So happily depressed  I generally have this happy-go-lucky attitude in life where nothing really bothers me.  But if I don't let myself ever feel hurt, then it becomes hard to experience joy.    God had brought me to a place last night where so many externalities in my life were going wrong.  I made a list: (1) I had felt like he was leading me to DC to a sweet job, but I'm stuck in SD.  My classmates will all have meaningful summer internships and I would be embarrased to have nothing.  (2) I have girl issues.  (3) I don't even have a temp job these days, and I bum around bored. (4) I had a strange night last night where a few good friends and I got into a skirmish ending with a bit of damaged pride. (5) I still live with my mom.  (6) I'm in major school and credit card debt.  That list may not sound like much to the reader, but items (1) and (2) are falling apart and they are a really big deal to me these days. I felt like such a loser, and normally I just brush it off and I'm totally fine.    I let myself feel this frustration and hurt and placed it before God.  I realized that those closest to God's heart are often the broken prophets not the "perfect" Christians.  Brother Yu, the girl in China who wrote Canaan songs, and my Beijing house church pastor usually seemed pained by this world, their sin, and persecution.  But they found hope in Christ, and not in worldly circumstances.  I laid down my self-confidence (that I have a lot of) for God-confidence and it was hard, but beautiful, because I was happily depressed.

       Toyed by Diplomatic Security  &nbsp;  Why is the State Dept toying with my feelings?&nbsp; I only want to work there like a humble grad student.&nbsp; Don't they see that my summer is slipping away?&nbsp; Sad, sad, sad.&nbsp; I got another call this morning from them, asking more questions about my background from more agency forms they've acquired.&nbsp; This translates into more delays.&nbsp; Oh well.  &nbsp;  -----  &nbsp;  I'm hitting Pacific Beach today!  &nbsp;  This morning I randomly woke up at 5 AM and went lap swimming at 6AM.&nbsp; Strange.

Ok, I'm about to mention the biggest bio-related hookups in the world!&nbsp; If any one of my friends reading this is about to graduate soon in bio or want to switch jobs from public to private sector, this is for you.&nbsp;   A friend of mine is leaving Pfizer (so hard to get a job there), and he needs to hand off his "research associate" position in La Jolla, San Diego.&nbsp; It's entry level (not much experience required), he says his coworkers are so professional and nice, and the pay is roughly $50K / year with excellent benefits.&nbsp; They&nbsp;have their own unlimited business credit cards and stuff too!&nbsp; What the heck!&nbsp; I was only paid $30K out of college to do the same work.  He's leaving in a week, so get back to me soon if you're interested.&nbsp; This is golden!

       Colin Powell, Tuesday  The second day I was at work, there was this huge commotion in the C St lobby when I heard over the radio: "He is arriving now."  Doors were propped open wide, and security become extra tight for those few moments.  I stood near the doors waiting for my security badge when suddenly a stretch limo pulled up and Colin Powell walked in!  I tried to act non-chalant, as if I didn't notice or care while all other eyes were fixed on his entry.  Should I shake his hand?  Try to meet him?  Yeah right, not with the crazy security detail and special forces outside.  He walks by me, passing within 5 feet of me in a relatively empty lobby.  A woman civil servant crossing his path stops out of respect for him to pass first.  He freezes before getting to her, motions her across his path, and says, "Come on now, we all have work to do," in a gentle manner.  By now the whole room is smiling, especially her, as he reaches her hand out and embraces hers.  Then he disappears behind security gates, leaving a room full of smiling security and staff.  Colin Powell is definitely my favorite American public figure of all time!  -----  Friday Night Out  My friends here in DC have been here for 2 months, so the novelty of going out has already worn off.  That's unfortunate, because now it's hard to find people to hang out with on weekends.  Last night directly after work, I went to an going away party at a martini bar in Georgetown.  Then after that, the group of 8 people went to Cafe Asia for dinner.  Then my friend Jon from State (who I just met that day) and I met up with some UCDC girls for a night of dancing at Adams Morgan.  We finished at 3AM and walked home.  I don't have a key to the place I'm staying and I didn't want to wake my roommate when it was so late.  I asked my guy friend if I could just crash on his floor for the rest of the night, but he was so mean about it.  He said cheesy stuff like, "Listen, I only met you today," or, "that's not the way I roll," or "don't make me be an a**hole."  I was so offended that he was being like that.   When I went home early this morning, my roommate was so worried.  My roommate stayed up until 4AM waiting and worrying, and even watched the news all morning to make sure I didn't get hurt.  That was so nice and loving.   -----  Pictures  I really want to take pictures of my office and my daily life at the State Dept to show you.  However, diplomatic security warns that "imint" (image intelligence) is just was dangerous as "humint" (human intel, spies).  Plus, I don't take any chances with security in my office.  I get a daily reading folder full of cable transmissions in a folder marked "secret."  It is lined in red, and there are government warnings everywhere.  The cover itself is UNCLASSIFIED (in case DS is reading this), and I wanted to take a picture of the cover for my blog, but that may still be risky.  So I decided not to.  :(

       Free internet at the Library of Congress  The main reading room in the Library of Congress is so beautiful!  I'm sitting under the rotunda now, writing this email.  -----  First day at the State Dept  I am so blessed!  My boss is the nicest and most compassionate woman.  She took me out to lunch, paid for me, and she is so supportive of my work in her office.  She's also the chief of the entire regional security program office.  Needless to say, I'm having the best time at work.  I sit and read "secret" documents about East Asian security for hours at a time, and I love it.  I'm like a kid in a candy shop!  They already gave me my first project, which I can't talk about but it's really cool.  On Wednesday, I need to go to a press conference on new visa policy to take notes on behalf of all of the Asia desks (Bureaus overseeing Embassy policy).  The work may be intimidating to an outsider, but it's so exciting to me!  The best thing is that I work in the main State Dept compound, in the same building as Colin Powell, but 4 floors below him!

       Chinese Christian Church  Nancy from CFC Berkeley brought me to her church in the area. It was pretty cool and I met a lot of great people. We just make fun of each other the whole time, which is strange because they see her as this nice, quiet girl. I'm dispelling that myth. Haha!  I ran into a guy, Rob, at CCC that went to China and did missions. It turns out the we both volunteered at the same orphanage. What's crazier is that he was there hanging out at that orphanage with Steven Curtis Chapman! Cool! He's also friends with the youth pastor of my church in SD. Random.  -----  Shopping in DC  It is so incredibly hard to buy stuff in DC without a car. I need to take the metro to Pentagon Square or walk 8 blocks to M St. For the past 2 days I went everywhere looking for shirts and dress socks. The exciting thing is that I bought my first "Club Monaco" button down shirt! I was so excited because it was $65 marked down to $19! It is so cool, bec the front has cool lavender stitching on a white and gray background. You'll have to have a queer eye to appreciate it, which I do.  -----  Apparently I'm "gorgeous"  I stood outside of Cafe Asia (trendy restaurant / bar) on Friday night near Dupont Circle (gay area) trying to talk on the phone with my mom. As was on the phone, some small, thin, homeless man tried to talk to me. He sounded really affeminate, but I gave him some change. Then he looks at me and says in a girly voice, "You're gorgeous," as he looked me up and down. I felt like a piece of meat on display for him, which was funny.  My response, "Too bad girls don't think so!" Haha.  Then he says, "What are you? Korean? Japanese? I like Korean." Imagine this all spoken with the most sexy voice a homeless man can muster up.  "No, I'm Chinese," I responded.  "Oh, well, you don't have to tell people that! You can just say that you're Korean. I like Korean." He asserted.  Okay, that was interesting. But I actually wasn't uncomfortable at all. I thought he was really nice, so I said my goodbyes and joined my friends for dinner. It was the dinner after the Martini happy hour, before Adams Morgan, and much before my friends disowned me later that night. Sad. :(
