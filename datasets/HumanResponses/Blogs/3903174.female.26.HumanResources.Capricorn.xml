						     Let's start with the engagement, shall&nbsp;we? &nbsp;This is what happend last July 18,2004, Sunday (Manila Time) &nbsp;   urlLink   He said      and    urlLink   She said     &nbsp;:)       I'd like to thank all of our friends who kept this secret from me, without you guys.. I woundn't&nbsp;be surprised. Special mention to Maya, who all along knew Adrian already got the ring from the jeweler and never made any signals not even via mental telepathy. To Eric, whom I always ask about what he knew everytime I get the chance to grill him about it. To Erwin, who is  urlLink 7443 nautical miles  away from us ( that's according to the link Erwin sent to me) and still&nbsp;kept his silence after Adrian&nbsp;sent&nbsp;him the picture of the ring and didn't mention a word when we chat online. And to all the others who knew about it but I was not able to interrogate... (you lucky you!)

						     I have created this blog to share with you the blow by blow accounts on our upcoming wedding. From the engagement to the preparation &nbsp;to the day itself&nbsp; even until the honeymoon. That is why I named this The True Wedding Story - inspired by the show E! The True Hollywood Story. I hope you get to enjoy the ride with us. Wish us Luck!  &nbsp;  Feel free to give your comments or suggestions.. we need all that we can get.

						    I envisage my wedding to be simple yet elegant, small and private with nature’s natural beauty surrounds my groom, our guests and me. And that is why we’ve decided to have our wedding vows in The Chapel of the Transfiguration, Caleruega, Batulao, Batangas. And the reception will be somewhere in Tagaytay (most probably).     I didn’t exactly plan to have my wedding outside the metropolis but as Ezra have carefully conveyed her plan for my wedding; I was so excited that I’ve decided right there and then that Caleruega it is! We talked about almost everything, from the motif to the centerpieces, to the flower and plants for the chapel, the cake, the gown, the entourage, the flower girls, the place to stay, the giveaways for principal sponsors and guests, the reception…Gosh, there are so many things to do! And may I not forget the church’s requirements (birth certificate, confirmation, counseling) Thank God for Wedding Coordinators!  Though we have not visited the place yet, and have not made any deposit or reservations, I’d say this would definitely be it…we’re schedule to make an ocular visit on Aug 14 (hope it pushes through). I won’t be sharing in detail what the plans will be for the big day ( so that there will be an element of surprise)… just as a teaser, I’d say my wedding will have a Nature Spring Theme. :)
