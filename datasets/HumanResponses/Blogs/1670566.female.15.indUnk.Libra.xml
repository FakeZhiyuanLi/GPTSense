Associated sa buddhist religion kaya ang raming sayings courtesy of Chow Yun Fat. The grade that I can give to this movie is A.  FORMULA ONE RACING-- they had the qualifying 2 hours ago. Kimi is in 4th place thanks to Montoya here... at least he's ahead of the Leader [of the moment] of the Driver's Championship, M.

      hokei.... to tell yar the truth matees: I fell asleep yesterday.... not in my bed but in the classroom, at the theatre... almost everywhere..! I slept while Noli Me Tangere was played.. not because it's boring [well slight..] but it's because that I didn't sleep very well last thursday night. It was horrible... I woke up at exaclty 12 in the evening... or morning... or hating-gabi... and after that, I can't sleep.... so I decided to watch the television. It was 4 straight hours.... my head was totally aching and my eyes were wide awake. My brain was telling me to sleep but my soul kept telling me to stay awake! guess what, I did... it was so stupid of me.... Well when it was 5:00am I decided to take a bath ahead of my siblings.... I thought it'll help me stay awake but i guess my plan backfired. At school, my eyes were shuting down like crazy, my head was extremely aching and my hands were too tired to write. I did survive the first 2 periods. I was lucky because yesterday was Noli Me Tangere day... meaning, we watched Noli Me tangere yesterday at the AFP theatre. On the way, my world was all wriggly and i can't see clearly and then i realized that i want to barf.... i want to barf right now! hehehe, like i said I was lucky. I didn't barf... i burped but the dizziness inside my head was still waltzing inside. Thankfully, we got off the bus and I felt alright.... not until we entered the theatre! Inside the threatre, it was darn hot! Really really REALLY hot... to tell ya the truth, it was the first time that i sweat inside a theatre. Halfway the play, my eyes were beginning to shut down.... I can barely understand what the characters are saying... and then i snoozed.... haha since it was my lucky day, I didn't drool to whoever or to myself. If i did, I'll be soooooooOOOOoooOoOo humiliated. Well.. when it was intermission time, i asked my brother what's the latest about the F1 qualifying [see, everywhere i go, i still think about formula one!] and he said that kimi was in 5th....I was a little bit frustrated, the show continued... i fell asleep as the lights went out... but i didn't slept all the time! Sometimes I open my eye and see what's happening... when the play was over i was psyched! time to go home. When i arrived at home, i lie down... and sleep.. for a second. I went to my brother and I saw he was playing FF tactics. Then at 7:00pm, I fell asleep on the couch... and then somebody woke me up b/c it was time to eat. Between 9:30-10:00pm, i fell asleep on my parents' bed... i was waiting for Takuma Sato to qualify but i missed it... Then, our guardian [my parents are in Malaysia right now] woke me up at 11:00pm... i was drooling and my mouth was wide-open, darn allergy! So I brushed my teeth and went to my bed to sleep again. So... yesterday was sleeping day!  Saturday were not Kimi and Schuey's day. Kimi's position was 8 while Schuey was 14th... Hehehehehe This sport is so unpredictable which makes me an avid fan! RAGAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!  So that's it... Lots of luck to Kimi and Schuey tomorrow... may the best man win! hahahaha!  As for me, im going to study tomorrow... trigo... its test days AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Wish me luck too!  Take a break people of the World!  Quote of the day: "YEY! PANG14th si SCHUMACHER!! May KAUNTIng pag-asa pa si Kimi!"

      Wala lang.... feeling ko ansama sama ngayong araw na'to. First, ang aga-aga kong nagising... hinde ko alam kng bakit maaga ako nagising. Tas pagktapos nun, nagmass kami tas hinde ko alam na ang jolog-jolog ng suot ko kasi mejo lumilipad ung utak ko kasi nga soooOOOoooper inaantok ako! hahahahahaha! Naku, kung may nakakita sa akin, pagtatawanan siguro ako ng malakas! hahahahaha syete.... an sama talaga! Pagdating ko sa bahay, sumakit yung chan ko kaya an tagal ko sa banyo! [hehehehe, darn that pizza last night! pizza nanaman kinain namin nung lunch!]  After ko i-check kung there's something new sa "Friendster", nanuod ako ng CSI tas kinamot ko yung mata ko and it turned bloody red! Feeling ko wala na kong mata... feel ko its covered with blood! Tas, nilagyan ko ng eye drops tas nagviolin ako with one eye closed para kumalat yung gamot sa mata ko. Pagkatapos ng isang oras na nakakangawit na pagtugtog ng violin [at iisang piyesa lang ang tinutugtog ko... dahil hinde ko masundan yung tape... well that's another story..], an sakit paren ng mata ko, feel ko pa rin wala na akong left eye... luckily, dumating yung mommy ko and praised me sa pagtutugtog ko ng violin at sinabing gumagaling na raw ako! [hahahaha!] tas napansin nya na nakapikit yung mata ko tas sinabi ko na masakit yung mata ko. Since my mom is an optalmologist, tinignan nya yung "bloody" left eye ko tas sabi nya namamaga yung mata ko and warned me for the last time na: "wag na wag mong kakamutin yung mata mo!" Aion, nilagyan niya ng ibang klaseng eye drops and closed my eye for another hour and i feel much better now. Pero namumula parin. Sinisisi ko yung allergies ko na namana ko sa tatay ko. Lahat ata namana ko sa tatay ko: asthma, allergicrhinitis, sungking ngipin [same tooth and same side] yung shape ng big toe namin, yung nose bridge namin, yung mukha [girl version raw ako ng tatay ko] eyes and yellow teeth! Kaasar, hinde ko nakuha ang katalinuhan nya sa chemistry! heheheh... well, we still have our differences like I'm a good swimmer/athlete/violinist [kinakareer na!]! Hinde makasabay yung tatay ko sa technology. He doesn't even know how to send emails or use the internet for crying out loud! Ginagamit lang nya yung computer kapag maglalaro ng freecell at microsoft powerpoint. Ang rami rami nyang high tech stuff-> laptop, palmtop, digi cam [yan lang ata ang nagagamit nya ng matino!... pati rin pala yung laptop!], dvd player... ang rami! Yung palmtop nya binigay nalang nya sa akin pero natanggal lahat ng games kaya nakastore lang jan! Kabibili pa lang nya ng 2 maliit na digi cam pero meron pa naman shang isa pang digi cam na pwedeng gamitin! even his cellphone has a built-in-camera so 4 na yung digi cams nya! hehehehe bumili sha ng isa pang dvd player kasi kala nya sira na yung isa so 3 dvd players yung nandto sa bahay... hay naku... gastador talaga yang tatay ko... pero ok lang, love ko pa ren sha!  Aion... sana bumili si daddy ng maliit na video cam at sana pagsawaan nya para saakin mapadpad yun.... yun ang wish ko eh! hehehehe, pangarap kong magkaroon ng video cam na maliit... hehehe, nag-iipon na nga ako eh!

Ang nagsasalita lang e yung guidance councillor or yung mga class officers! 2)Pag may nakaupo na sa tabi mo, automatic to: Anong pangalan mo? Shempre... DUH! hahahahahahahahahah! 3)Nagiging giraffe yung mga tao...humahaba yung leeg eh. Hinahanap ang mga class cuties no doubt... 4)Pag nakita na ang class cutie, ayaw mo nang kausapin yung katabi mo kasi gusto mong katabi eh yung class cutie. 5)Hinde mawawala ang human bingo sa interaction. ewan ko nga ba kung bakit human bingo, ang rami naman jang laro deba? Trip to Jerusalem...HAHAHAHAHA! 6)Pag nag group activity, sigurado yan.... tinatawag ang lahat ng santo para lang ihingi ang kanilang gusto: Maging ka-group yung class cutie. 7)Pag kumakain na kayo at lahat ng lalaki ay nasa labas... [halos] sigurado yan, lalapitan yung babaeng nakapartner yung class cutie at maraming itatanong yan sa yo... maniwala kayo sakin.... yung partner ko considered as class cutie...or heartthrob...or something. Basta.... 8)Pagkainan na ren, tahimik... shempre sarap kumain eh... hahahahah! 7)Pag may group activity, hinde maiiwasan na may makikita kang hinde mo sinasadyang makita... take it from me, 2 beses nang nangyari sa akin yan eh! hahahaha! 10)Bago umalis, hinde rin maiiwasan ang kunin ang number ng partner mo... para maycontact ka deba? pero ako...? Hinde ko kinuha... HAHAHAHAHA! 11)Parating may graffiti board... lahat magssign dun... I swear, kahit pangalan lang ang malagay dun kasi 1/8 lang ang gamit na illustration board eh. Kahit nga smiley face, ipagpipilitan pa eh, basta makasulat dun!  After ng interaction: 1)Pag wala na sila sa venue place, sigurado, mag-uusap usap ang mga tao about dun sa katabi mo or partner. At ang unang itatanong sa yo ay: Nakuha mo yung number ni _____? 2)May maaasar dun sa taong nakatabi or nakapartner ang class cutie or ang kanilang crush. Hinde mawawala yan! Kulang na lang ihagis ka na sa bintana eh. 3)Pagdating sa classroom, sisigaw at kikiligin ang mga tao. OO lalu na yung mga taong an lakas ng tama sa kanila nung "crush" or di kaya'y class cutie [usually kasi yung class cutie ang may pinakamaraming admirers...]. 4)Eto, certified 'to! Hinde naging masaya at exciting ang interaction nyo pag hinde kayo pinagalitan ng teacher. Oo.. teacher. Maingay kasi sa loob ng classroom eh.

Inagaw nga eh, pero ok lang... as if it makes any difference.. kahit hinawakan nya yun mas marami akong fingerprints dun kaysa sa kanya. HAHAHAHAHA! Pero mabait sya kaso pa-cute [kung mabasa man nya to.. no offense pero... MABAIT KA TALAGA! HAHAHAH! sipsip ba?:)]. Oh well, basta iisa lang ang sinabi ko sa mga tao tungkol sa kanya: Mabait sha....

Oo nga pala, pupunta rin dito at magcoconcert yung A.S.O.S- yung banda ni Barbie sa MG, Si Vic at si Jerry sa November 29, pero guests lang sila. Marami sigurong pupunta katulad nung sa Stars and Cars na  organized by Mercedes-Benz na 40,000 fans ang pumunta para makita yung McLaren Drivers nung November 8 na naalala ko na isa sa mga McLaren Drivers na si Kimi Raikkonen ay pumunta sa Las Vegas para sa isang conference with Michelin na bigla kong naalala ang Limo Car na sinakyan namin sa Las Veags na kinuhanan pa kami ng picture sa loob ng car na yung picture na yun nakalagay sa Friendster!

Nakakatuwa basahin yung mga libro niya kasi tungkol yun sa mga karanasan nya na hinde makakalimutan [not to mention really funny!].  Nalaman ko ren na pag-athlete ka.... kailangan may sarili kang diet kahet ba F1 driver ka lang. Kahit siguro professional skateboarder ka kaialangan may diet ka pa ren. Nyahahahahahahahahaha.

      Bukash, tesht namin... kinakabahan na ako, hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko.... kanina pa ako nag-aaral, pero feeling ko, hindi pumapasok sa utak ko... kaya magbabasa pa ulit ako.... kahit.... ahhhhh never mind...  sana nga pumasa ako sa mga tests ko bukash, sobrang nagmememorize ako: ANg paghahalal sa Kapitan at Maria Makiling-- komediya yan na pino-propose ng mga Liberal [sharks, hinde pumapasok yung word na Liberal at conservador sa utak kO!]. Ang freaky at halatang-halata naman na may gusto si Slavi kay Maria Clara. Nakapatay si Ibarra ng buwaya. Kumanta si Maria Clara ng Kundiman ng Pag-iisang dibdib. Maraming suliranin ang hinaharap ng guro: kailangan ng paaralan, nawawalan ng respeto sa kanya, sinubukang tigilan ang pamamalo, ang mga libro ay wikang kastila kaya mahirap intindihin ng mga estujante etc. Freaky talaga si Salvi at nawala na ng tuluyan si Crispin at Basilio. Nabaliw na si Sisa, nahuli ng guwardiya sibil pero napakawalan din naman ng alperes.  Marami-rami yan... hinde ko pa nasasabi  lahat![duh!]  Anyways... magbabasa pa ako ng pinoi........ gusto ko mataas ako dun! EHEHEHEHEEH! TALASALITAAN GALOREEEEE!!!!

      Friday was our day! We had our FIELD TRIP in ENCHANTED KINGDOM!_ It's like the Disneyland of the Philippines! We rode ALMOST ever ride available at Enchanted Kingdom: The Flying Fiesta, The Wheel of Fate, The Rolerblade [or skates... whatever], ANCHORS AWAY!, SPACE SHUTTLE, 4D- DIscovery Theatre: Escape from Bane Manor and of course Rio Grande Rapids! Ahhhhhh yes.....  When we rode the Flying fiesta... wewere screaming... we were having fun being thrown in the air sitting on a seat  which made me very dizzy [I didn't tell anyone I wanted to Barf]. Well anyways, we headed to the wheel of fate and I tell you, I was figgin scared sitting on top of that wheel. But of course, I still didn't tell my friends i was scared. When we decided to ride on the rollerblade [or skate... whatever] we met up with some dinosaur mascots and we took some pictures!  After the rollerblade [or skate...whatever....] ride, we saw the ANCHORS AWAY! We rode on it like 2 times! It was friggin amazing because it was my first time to ride the Anchors Away. Anyways, after the 2nd ride of the Anchors away, I felt dizzy and I decided to drink some water and sit down. While I was resting, my pals rode on this ride called the bump and splash! So while they were riding the bump and splash, i saw this ride called the space shuttle. seeing that ride, it made me barf. really... my pals wanted to ride that ride and of course, i can't back out because they'll call me: KJ! so... with some few  bola-bolas  from the attendants of the sapce shuttle, I decided to ride it. I was screaming my head as I heard the click [long story] and after the ride, I wanted to ride it again. So I rode the Space Shuttle three times. After the 3rd time, my world was blurry and i realized, I WAS DIZZY! hahaahahahahaha SO after an hour, we went to this theatre and it was in 3D! The movie was so scary I was screaming inside the theatre house... It was fun.. and scary. After watching that cool movie, we went to Rio Grande Rapids and it was my first time to get wet on that ride. The 2nd time we went to Enchanted Kingdom, i was barely wet in that ride. So, I was happy I got wet in that ride for the first time.  The time given to us was short.... Oh well at least on April 6 I get to ride them all! HAHAHAHAHA... HAPPY!  *woooo-paaah!

      Its a sleepy saturday... want to know why?  Last Night we had our promenade. Yup... everybody [hmm... ALMOST everybody] was talking about it since monday, january 12... They were excited [hmm... well, i was not excited..] because of their gowns, their dates and... their dates. Everywhere you go, you'll here a third year student talking about her date. I find it irritating. Those names... boy names keep ringing in my head like my mother screaming at me because I did something wrong [hey, im not a boy hater but it's kind of irritating hearing the same 'ol stories about their dates]! One thing's for sure, I like listening to the people who talks about their wonderful gowns. So for one whole WEEK.. PROM GALORE! heehee... Well I liked it because if there are ANY announcements regarding the prom, they take a subject just to tell us the announcements...  Anyways, Thursday night...no biggie... but i stayed late at night just to watch some stupid tv show, thus I became sleepy around 2 pm, Friday afternoon. When Friday night came, HAH! People are "matured" as we speak [probably because of the gowns]. But for me, my stomach ached because I drank coke around 3:30 that day. hehehehe, my burping was uncontrollable... I hated it, man!  My mom was even more excited than I am... especially when me and my date were posing for a picture. For a second there, I guess my mom feels tingly inside.... but that's just a hunch...   When we arrived there, it was cold and then it became hot! Gosh, are the aircons on?! hehehehe...  my date, namely mike, was a weird BUT funny guy...? yeah I guess so. Dancing king would be the appropriate title for this guy. so he's a weird/ funny/dancing king guy. hehehehe... bah, just ask my friends or even better, just ask her sister of what kind of guy he is... [hahahahah as if you know them...]  FOOD WAS AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! I only liked the noodles under the pork roulade. everything else, they are AWFUL! Blegh! RAGAHHHHHH!!! What kind of food do they serve in those hotels??!?!?!?!  It was a short night.. the dance time... it was short, there was only one slow dance [KATHLYN!!! SORRY!! d ka nakaslow dance ni mike! SOrry SOrry!] and then the awarding was kind of loooooong, it took 30 mins to announce the winners. By 11:30, IM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPY!! SLEEPY SLEEPY SLEEPY SLEEPY SLEEPY SLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Gosh, I think my pictures are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay ugly! DARN YOU, PHOTOGRAPHER GUY! YOU ARE THE MOST IRRITATING PERSON I HAVE EVER SEEN, its a LOOOOOOOOONG story! [good thing he doesn't know me because I don't know him either!]I really don't like to look at my pictures... please burn them! Kidding... HAHAHAHA  Prom was okei, well... slightly okei. DANCING TIME WAS LIKE 2 FRIGGIN HOURS! [or less...] hehehehehe the giveaways were cute and nicely done. Manila Hotel's FOod sucks and I went home 2:30 in the morning because there was only ONE PHOTOGRAPHER and Liza had their barkada pic and they were the last in line, thus a sleepy saturday...  ......TAKE A NAP, JUNIORS OF SHSQC! hehehe:]  *woooo-paaah!

No really, im so serious! -> our report cards will be given to our parents some time in January. -> I really haven't decided on what will I write on my research paper. As a matter of fact, I don't have A TOPIC, HOW THE HECK AM I GONNA WRITE A RESEARCH PAPER??? -> Last but not the least, the never ending projects to be submitted sometime between feb and march.

Anyways... new year so.... lets start off really happy!  Well, I had a good christmas with my family.

      as of now: confusion takes over my mind and body. As the third year is coming to an end, I still don't know what course to take it college. My friends, parents as well as my teachers don't know how much pressure and stressed out I am just thinking what course I will take.  We had our career talk and there are a BUNCH of professionals ranging from teachers, nurses, pedias, producers, attorneys and so on. Yes. I was confused. They were always saying that I should take a course that is related somehow to my interests. I have tons of interests to choose from: sports, Tv, movies, Books, Radio, Dogs.... MANY! Very broad. Oh God, please give me a sign: a bluebird!   Actually, Food Technology is what im thinking. Although my chemistry grade is in a very wrong position, I like FOOD. Except japanese but the point here is that FooD is what i want therefore, Food Technology is what I want to take. Its a non quota and I think I can survive. I know there's no MONEY or no assured JOBS, at least im surrounded of what I REALLY LIKE!  The second is MassCommunication with a major in Films. I like watching movies. Its my hobby. It relaxes me when Im stresses and it makes me feel calm and steady so, I can see myself working as an editor or something or a producer.   The third is Nursing...yes I know, I can be richer and have a SURE Job and I can work 3 a week, but is it really what I want? Do I want to go to work and see those people in pain? See those people who pay thousands of money just to survive. Yes, it might be exciting when you're an ER nurse but do I feel comfortable seeing people in pain? Im I in it for the money of do I  really want it because I want to see hearts/lungs/stomachs/nerves of the people makes my life "thrilling?"   Yes, I'm looking for "thrills" but seeing the body organs inside is not so thrilling to me....  Oh man...help me dear Lord, I hope that the course I will take up will be the right choice because I don't want to shift no more..  Dear Lord, I hope that I will pass UP.... I know Im a smart kid so please help me in my studies today. Thanks so much!  Thanks so much for the people who prays [if there are any] for me for my college course or something. Thank you so much. No words can express the gratitude Im giving to you!  *woooo-paaah! Take a break once in a while... Quote of the day:"chismax? ano yun?" [babs] Food of the day: Fishballs! Color of the day: Green!

      Last February 19... it was THE dreaded day of my life... well, not exactly. You see, we have this annual Student's TakeOver at our school and after that day, we will have the educator's day where teachers will go have some fun! Our AP teacher assigned me and my friend, Catherine to be her substitute for the student's take over. It was our first time so our initial reaction was: YEHEY! WE'RE GONNA BE STUDENT TEACHERS WOOOOO-PAAA! The lesson to be taught: Industrial Revolution. Oh yeah, the time where the machines were born...like the telephone...radio....sewing machine. So we thought... oh yeah, what a piece of cake. It was a big mistake... So, along came feb 19 and it was my first time to wear a skirt at school.... a SKIRT...NOT A DRESS. haahahahaha. Oh yes, we thought it was going to be easy....but noooooooo. Our batch..oh our bitch mates were so noisy. yeah.... they don't want to copy notes, don't want to listen... they just want to talk  CHISMIS!  [chismis: rumors] oh yes.. know I know how it feels like standing there and no one's listening. It must be really hard being a darn teacher huh?  So anyways, before I end our class, we gave a quiz! So, as i was taking off the notes from the board [the notes were written in a manila paper], the manila paper touched my right eyeball. YES...MY  RIGHT EYEBALL. I tell ya, the manila paper can be very dangerous.... I was just happy my classmates got perfects scores... probably they were cheating. Oh well.. im a kid not a teacher. HAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Teacher or not... I still believe that I should enjoy my high school life.... although it's really hard.... hahhahahahah! I can DO IT! *say it with me!* I CAN DO IT! I CAN DO IT! CAN I DO IT???? hahahaha, wish me luck, viewers!  *woooo-paaah! Take a break once in a while... Quote of the day: "Formula One Fever!"

      uhm yeah...it's been a longggg time since I've updated this journal but I must confess, I thought this journal is gone.... I've switched to LJ because I can understand the tags used to modify the layout of the journal. Well...I'm trying to understand how to modify my "template" so that It'll be unique and all...  while I'm fixing this journal, check out my other  urlLink journal   so check it out...there are a lot of things I've written there since my last post here at blogger. do hope you enjoy my LJ...  *woooo-paaah!
