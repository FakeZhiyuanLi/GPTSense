       ahh, nighttime, how wonderful it is, yes, wonderful indeed. it seems to me that it's morning, yet i should know otherwise, i prefer to be awake at night because it's so much quieter than the daytime hours. and yet there are still so many things going on that i never feel bored. the internet knows no night or day. well that's my bit of phylosophy for now.  now, on to the master plan, the total and undeniable defeat of microsoft. now i don't propose to destroy the company directly, that would be too difficult and just a bit ilegal. no, i propose a different route. if you will join me, in my quest to build the greatest OS of all time, then you shall be part of the future, for microsoft's days are numbered, even though i am unsure of how many, because miss gabby's the psychic in our special team, not me. however we shall have to work quickly, for soon their tyrany shall be complete, but when i seel programs, i will not add an XP to the end of the name and tell you that you have to pay me more money, no     no no, i will provide the OS with all of the updates that i can make, and they will not be there to patch big, gaping holes, but to make it more stable and user freindly within itself, and  though it will be easy to use for the technophobes around us, the unfearing will find many things that can be done through more advanced options, and it will seem as though a new world had opened up before them. I shall keep you informed of my progress.

       so yeah, i got this book, "key of solomon the king," and it's pretty interesting, but also deadly, but that's what makes it fun. anyways, i was thinking about summoning a demon to make sure people don't get into my locker during school, or maybe my room when i'm not in it, but i don't think i want trespassers to be killed instantly for going where they're not supposed to be, too messy. well, i'm sure there's somethin in here i can use, maybe this portal to hell thing is worth trying, well, yeah, so, done now.

       So yeah, my cell fone broke, but i got a new, but now i have no $, but yeah, so i have a new one, and i need ppl's #'s, so i can feel like i'm significant. But i am, i am. u see, whilst i am but a child, i am but a smarty pants. yes, a smarty pants. i also can't spell or anything like that. but i know html, which is kind of funny if u think about it. so my dream is to be a quantum physicist and do stuff like that, i even made a ppt presentation about it, several, if i recall. i even have a side dream about destroying microsoft, but that's not important, they'll destroy themselves eventually. yeah, so right now, i'm really tires and it's a miracle i haven't made this into anincoherent rant-type thing, although maybe i have... ne ways, back to it. global warming - how do we stop it? the answer= i dunno. well, that leads us into angela lansberry, she is so hot, i would date her if i wasn't gay. but i am, so that' doesn't help her any, too bad. so yeah brad pitt, he's hot. really HOT!!! but i woulsn't go out with him. he has too much $. if u have a yacht, i say: gimme that, and then i'll leave u alone. and yeah, i also think i like tim allen for some reason, but i dunno. wee oh wee oh wee tiger birdy sumthin somethin yeah

       ok not really, but i was at one point today, and i think y'all should know about it. it was a little while, about 6 or 7 hours, ago, that my good friend gabby told me about her day in drivers ed. not that it was good or anything, but it did give me an idea. you see, they were told to write and essay about something, i don't know what anymore, and to draw a picture to represent it. i decided to do the same, my essay is entitled:  -~happiness is like....~-  happiness is like garlic salt. because garlic salt makes things taste good, expecially dr. thingder, which is a really good soft drink that you would buy if we actually made it. happiness is also like having the volume all the way up on your speakers. bucause even though you you have to buy more and have to pay that 'disturbance' fine, you got to cover up the noise from your porn flik, but u get arrested for that too, because you're in the state of denial, where only those aged 90 or above can legally own porn.  happiness is like a watch. because you can cut off circulation to your hand and scare people when it falls off in your glass of non-alchoholic beverage. Ok, because i'm poor, and yahoo's stupid about it, the pic to go with this story is  urlLink here

        so yeah, i tried to make myself diurnal, instead of nocturnal, and it didn't work. so that's what took away my time to write stuff in here, that and my extremely forgetful nature. but well, i do have stuffens to write about, for rizzel, and it's important, world-changing stuff too. well, the first part is that my team, the spelwerks team, has succesfully had two meetings, while these meetings accomplished absolutely nothing, they did demonstrate our abililty to.. to... have meetings? well, it's a start. also, two days ago, in a mall not too far from here, i found a book, a magical book, full of the keys of all things computational, and it could tell the future. yes, it was C++ for beginners. well, this is important because i will use it to begin my empire, my e-empire, which will start out to cost me so much money that i'll have to live in a trash bag, but one of those with triple-layering, and drawstrings, because if i'm gunna live in a trashbag, i'm gunna live in a  fancy  trashbag. well, after i have my super-powers, which is to say my super-powerful programming skills, i will save the universe from the oppression of microsoft! which i may have mentioned before now, but i feel it's worth mentioning again. anyways, back to the present. also important: miss gabby's psychic hotline is up and running, so if you want to get your questions of the future answered, then you should get in line, and have your credit cards ready! that's about it, so's if you want me to know just exactly how smart i am compared to you, drop me a line.

       so yeah, i am reminded now of my young-un days, though it seems to me that they are not even over yet. but yes, i am reminded of them by my old spell-book. some people would call this my "book of shadows", but i find it dificult to read or write without light. what are you gonna do? well, the time i am reminded of is the time when my best friend told me her darkest secret, no she's not a lesbian, but she is a vampire. what i liked most about those few weeks was trying to catch up with her "maker". the way she described him was so, umm, how do i say this, mmmmmm nummy. actually, all she really said was that he was hot and had red eyes, but i could see where she was going with it. i was so mesmerized and hypnotized by the face i had constructed for the one i was to wed - in massachusetts, of course - that i was trying to find him long before i knew i was doing so. so, i contacted my friends on the astral plane, and they put me in contact with Belsarreck, who told me to go to the caves of Meshnareem, where i found this scary-lookin shaman fellow by the name of Bob, who set me on the path by telling me to go home and dance around a bonfire naked with wreaths of blood-stained flowers all about me, whilst shouting out the name of the one i seeked. so, when i got home, i, of course, called up Gabrille Mickeele, in whittermin wisconson, so that she could tell me the name of this dark-haired fellow, she said it was a name that only i could pronounce, cuz i smart like that, and spelled it out to me. so i went about preparing everything, i milked the bulls til they bled, so as to not harm anything too much, and i started up the bonfire with the mystical words, "starter uperrum!" and thus a new flame was born. i drenched my wreaths in the strange, milky-bloody substance, whilst draping them over the polyester animal skins i thought would add to the mood. so i then stripped dowm, and lubed up, seeing as how i might incur his "wrath" by summoning him to me, i crossed my fingers to that end. may the force be with me. i then started my shouting: "snazkaratoppenheimersmat!", i repeat: "snazkaratoppenheimersmat!", again: "snazkaratoppenheimersmat!", and once more: "snazkaratoppenheimersmat!". but now, all of a sudden, thefire burnt itself out, and i couldn't see worth a darn, but i did hear something, something BIG, or perhaps small, my hearing's not that good, but then i could see him, i could see him well.... return heer nest weak to no wat happens, tootles.

       wouldn't it be cool.... if you could point your finger at someone you don't like and fire tubes of chap stick at them? if you could scream so loudly and high-pitched that your head explodes and gets all over your enemies? if you could turn money into pencils just by invoking the dark lord ineminem? if arnold schwarzenegger could be president? but nooooo, that would be unconstitutional, and we couldn't have THAT, now could we? if microsoft went bankrupt a long time ago like it was supposed to? if scientists could go back in time, kill one of their ancestors, and finally stop arguing about it? if all of out keyboards glowed so we could stare at them to pass the time? if The Sound Of Music was played on at least one channel at  least  once a week? if magnets actually  did  lengthen our lifespans? if my cell fone could turn my kitty cat into a rather large rampaging beast-thing(with armor and a horn of course)? if i could invite dracula to one of my parties? if i had parties? if all dentists were required to wear clown noses? if i had more of these?  no really, i wanna know.
