      Dear Friendship Troubles,     Give your friend the weekend to calm down, and you should too. Think of what you might have said wrong to her. On Monday, try and talk to her again. Don't talk to her and bother too much. If she tells you to leave her alone, leave her alone. But just say to her, I understand that you are mad at me, but I really think you should listen to what I have to say. Then, if she lets you, explian to her that you are sorry, and you don't like not talking to her. If she doesn't let you explain, resort to the next step. Write her a note. Write down everything you would say to her if you were talking face to face. Tell her to write back, or talk to you. It might just take one appology, but if it doesn't don't keep bothering her. If she doesn't talk to you for more than a month, maybe this friendship wasn't meant to be. If you have any more problems, don't be afraid to tell me about them.

      Ask Kait is my new website for the troubled... Got some problems you need help with?   Step One: Drop me a note in the comments section.  Step Two: I will check my comments daily, so expect a response by the next day.   Notes: - If you do not want any one to know your e-mail or problems, just use a pen-name, such as Troubled. I will use that name when writing your response.  - I am sorry, but I cannot give out my e-mail adress, so all problems must be posted on the comments section of this website.
