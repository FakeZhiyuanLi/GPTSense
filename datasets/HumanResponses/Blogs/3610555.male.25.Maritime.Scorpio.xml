      "So how did that deal with the dead bum work out?" Andrew asked, referring to a story I recently wrapped up on police brutality, culminating in a week spent masquerading as a homeless person.  "Homeless person," I corrected. Bums are people, too: most of 'em. "Yeah. The dead guy." In the last three days of my assignment I had stumbled upon a homeless man who had evidently decided to exit by the fire escape; he was still cooling when I found him and made the call to 911, only to be flatly refused help by the cops. Turned out the city didn't want to be tying up precious taxpayer money and time with some nobody druggie, or so I was told. Two days after my story went to press three cops resigned in controversy over a post mortem that revealed one hundred thirty-two bruises on the lower torso 'by blunt, heavy object'-- read baton-- and no prior history of drug use. Even a newbie cokehead would've known better than to snort an eightball in fifteen to twenty-five minutes, let alone the managing editor of the Homeless Times; a homeless man by choice for ten years whom it turns out was onto the same trail of copshop slight-of-deed that I had been sniffing out. Rodney King eat your heart out.  "Pick up the paper every now and then, maybe you'll learn something." I don't slave away at my job to go unnoticed, even by someone who considers fortune cookies heavy reading. "I just wanted the inside scoop; you know, the shit you left out of the paper." "Oh." So he had read it. Maybe I should feel bad.  "I let them have both barrels; what you see is what you get." The truck made an abrupt about-face into the convenience store parking lot just in time to save me from having to flog a dead bum. I'd been answering questions for a week and a half; the giddy feeling had worn off precisly thirty seconds into the first barrage of inquires. I always heard what fame does to a person; my name next to a frontpage spread barely constituted notoriety and already I was tired of the heckling I got everywhere I went. Always ask the questions, I repeated to myself.  "Two cases, and a tall boy or two if they have them." Andrew reminded me as I slid out into the rain. I found the cases alright, but no tall boys. I smiled to myself for the first time in two weeks. There were two homeless people in line behind me at the register, gearing up for another night of boozy desolation. When I first joined their ranks, it broke my heart to see homeless men throw away what little they had on alchohol every night; by the time I left the streets I could hold my own with the best of 'em. The party's the same regardless of what circle you rub shoulders in, I thought as I listened to the two bums argue over pocket change. Only matters where you wake up in the morning.          "Hey, you're that anti cop guy at the newspaper, aren't you?", the store clerk asked as I ponied up for one case of light beer and a sixpack of good stuff. "I seen your picture on the news."  "Yeah, I'm the guy that wrote that article." I contemplated grabbing the beer and making a break for it before the inquistion started when the cashier asked the two bums behind me,  "How's it like getting attention from the papers?"  That's it, I thought. I grabbed my beer and started for the door, thinking to nip this interview in the bud, but only got one leg shaking before the world began to resemble a merry-go-round on a Scott Weiland acid trip and I was forced to make an emergency exit by the fire escape.

      I hate the rain.      Nothing serious, its just that with three straight days of the stuff I start to sympathize with Noah and that ark situation-- the inlaws, the smell. And I don't even own a cat.      While the rain drummed incessantly on the window overlooking 31st Street, I looked over my shoulder and took a medicinal shot of Jameson. Life is hard enough without sobriety.  Never look back, Samantha used to say; tonight though, forward visibility is zero and the radar's in the corner, quietly becoming inebriated.  Samantha had obviously never read Peter Egan-- hell, I didn't remember her reading anything but astrology, a tactic I thought odd for a law school hopeful. Forward visibility was never that great, I mused, or else perhaps I would have seen the animal's gaping maw before it ripped out my heart.        "Hair of the dog that bit me," I said as I poured a shot into the old flagon, but got no response. Probably a good thing, considering I was the only person in the room. Sanity? Check. Another shot of Jameson? Check and check. The old flagon refills quickly on a rainy night, I noted with dry wit; the corollary being that the old bottle empties disproportionately faster. Maybe the Jameson bottle is still running on Dublin time and thus empties itself four hours early; maybe the distillers forgot to set this particular bottle for Texas time and it was still humming Greensleeves, unaware that we eat our meals on Central Standard around here. Maybe the bottle wasn't water resistant to fifty meters. As I was turning over this little-studied piece of Irish engineering, the kitchen table started shaking violently. I hit the ceiling. Collecting myself, I grabbed the cell phone and, making a mental note to never again use vibrate, calmly answered,        "Mule barn. Head ass speaking."      "What time is it?" Fate rears its ugly head.      "I was just mulling over the idea of transatlantic time zone malfunctions--" I was unceremoniously interrupted by the drawl on the other end before I could finish my discourse on the mathematics of Irish whiskey drinking,       "--beer thirty!" Unused to horn conversations lasting this long, I felt diplomatic relations on the air waves becoming increasingly strained.         "I'm downstairs; get your ass down here before my truck floats away." I didn't have time to look out the rain spattered window before I heard a click and was left holding the empty line. In a moment of questionable clarity I threw on my coat and grabbed a medicinal shot for the road, thinking that if I didn't get my ass downstairs the phone wouldn't be the only empty line I'd be left holding tonight. And besides, according to the Jameson bottle it was getting pretty late.       Only after I had climbed into my brother's party barge on wheels did I remember my promise to buy him beer tonight.      "How late does this taxi run?" I asked as we launched from the curb into modest traffic. The Jameson started to kick in just as we careened past a moving van that didn't seem to be moving at all.       "Store's gonna close we need a coupla cases." Came the hurried reply.       "Shit! How many alcoholics you planning on feeding?" I tried to keep the waver out of my voice as we pulled into the oncoming lane to pass a slow moving Cadillac.       "Just you and me, bro."      "Great. And I was hoping to masturbate in peace tonight." The thought of throwing 'em back with my brother wasn't my first choice for a rain drenched Thursday; I really  was  looking forward to a little peace and quiet after recent events.

						   ONE MONTH: In the Lives of Tony and Samantha  I was alone but attentive in Dolloff’s class, Until you walked in and stared at my ass.  I was shy but you made me smile; Flirtatious glances for a while.  Then it was off to the coffee shop, A long conversation I didn’t want to stop!  Soon approaching was Valentine’s Day, And that night I was swept away.  Every day from then was just me and you; It all seemed too good to be true.  A six hour-long phone conversation Left both of us filled with fascination.   Only three weeks, Florida, and the sun; An “I love you” and my heart was won.  One month, nine months, ten years from now, Beside my love always, I eternally vow.

						      The Office  Prepares to Pontificate    The first week in November means two things for college football fans: time to decide how many birds to barbeque for Thanksgiving, and time to ask a blessing for that dressing of NCAA football turkey—bowl games.  How is my team doing this year? How can I get into the game?  Fortunately,  The Office  has answered the most important of these questions at  The Office  website-- the only resource for the consummate college fan. In a scant three weeks, Universities and fans alike will be preparing themselves for the cornucopia of football feasting:  2003 Rose Bowl Champions; 2003 Cotton Bowl Champs.  ‘Bowl Game Champions’ is a mouthful every fan loves to say, and every team loves to hear.  Cold weather, cold beverages and hot football are the bread and butter of college fans, and this season  The Office  is catering the party.  With bowl games already listed in  The Office's  inventory, fans can purchase their happiness now without the hassle of freezing lines at the stadium, or half hour phone calls, or last minute nail-biting.  When it comes down to brass tacks no fan should be left out in the cold; and no fan will be, after a quick stop by  The Office's  award winning website.   R,  The Office  CEO and all around live wire, has been larking about the office chanting, “It’s Bowl Game time, boys and girls.”  Ever the avid fan, he added that, “If we have to, we’ll sell every ticket we have-- except mine!”   The Office  already does brisk bowl game sales, with current figures hovering around $100,000 per bowl; at this rate, it looks to be another record breaking month in the millions for the Basement Crew.     The Office  also serves pre-bowlgame needs with a complete listing on their live online ticket buffet.  There are scads of football games left to be seen, and the easiest way to grab a slice of the pie is a quick stop at the  The Office's  homepage.  After all, those games aren’t going to watch themselves.   --Press Release, 2003

						    Unexpected Sales Numbers for Rugby World Cup have Fans Scrambling  With a Month and a Half ‘til Kickoff,  The Office  Sells over a $ Quarter Million   With a little over a month ‘til Rugby World Cup 2003 kicks off in Sydney, fans worldwide are jumping on open seats for their favourite matches: the October 18th match, England v. S. Africa, is selling especially well as die-hard fans in the UK snap up tickets ranging anywhere from a $215 USD category B seat to the $350 USD category A spots.  The stadium in Perth, Australia is filled to capacity nigh two months out due to the popularity of the Club from England.  Who would have guessed such vigorous response so early in the year, but it has become obvious that now is the time to grab your favorite matches- before tickets disappear.   Match #38, Australia v. Ireland, is a red-hot match at  The Office , as the two clubs are expected to pitch a voracious battle-- and at an average $200 USD per seat who wouldn’t fancy seeing these boys play.  This match is one in a long line of reasons Australia runs a close second to the UK in daily traffic across  The Office's  busy storefront.   In a shining example of faith and dedication many a Britisher have purchased Finals tickets, in expectation of England carrying the Cup.  The November 15th semi’s match is going for an average $475 USD, while those astute enough to grab their premium Finals tickets now, are only paying anywhere from $500 to $1000 USD.  	 R,  The Office  CEO, was caught saying that, “Fan response this year is unprecedented,” to the extent that, “no one can afford to wait long as the rush for premium seating has turned into a full-on stampede of drooling, eager rugby Fans.”  And the largest part of those eager fans calls the United Kingdom home; the rest of  The Office's  10,000 visitors a day hail from Australia, the Africas, and America.  With the unprecedented number of tickets sold, to the demographically largest fan base in the world, only one thing is certain: a rivalry on this order will make for the most exciting Rugby World Cup in living memory.        --Press Release, 2003

						   I am close to getting what I want right now if only I could resist the pressure of cracking, of trying to mend broken dreams simply because I have learned to live always holding on to someone else; so that when the time comes to stand on my own a little while I deteriorate to emotional horseshit and cast about for whatever life preserver might be found, which always happens to be the latest in a long line of failed relationships.  That the new-- the mist shrouded mount afar off, the tug on my heart strings, the Challenge and the Glory-- will sustain and nurture my otherwise horseshit doesn’t matter where my acquired dependency on third party emotions is concerned.  My life struggle, insofar as the term applies to this early breaking news sensation, seems to be finding the will power to move from one relationship to another. The only consolation I have in this particular case is the fact that though I am presently regressing, as is my manner, the relationship I'm moving into isn't a tried and failed one rather, it's one that was tried and then given a raincheck for more pressing matters.  In other words, the glimmer of half a chance awaits me at the end of this monotone rainbow, which makes for a far better shower than any I've previously endured. At this point I commence to dribbling on in broken english about the qualities of my current heart-lust and just what justifies us being together. Break out the violin, my friend.   --Originally penned Halloween Night, 2001; three minutes past Midnight.

						   S  There's something I've always wondered, and now one of my close friends is in the position to let me in on the answer. What exactly do married women with children do on Friday nights? I'm going to go out on a limb and suppose it's the same thing unmarried, twenty-five year old guys do-- try to tie up all the loose ends we call life. Twenty-five year old guys named Tony, that is-- Mea culpa. The nice man in the white jacket didn't feed me my vitamins this morning so I may come off as a wee bit wound up. I must admit, before we get much further, that I am an uninhibited email junkie of the free-love school when it comes to letter writing. That is to say, you're not the only one lucky enough to receive an email from Super T tonight. And although it doesn't make up for the social hole I've dug myself into, I am kinda starting to get into this editorially obtuse writing spree. Too bad a masculine version of The Vagina Monologues would never catch on. Oh wait, that's my day to day. It wouldn't be fair to say I'm a mysogynist, as I spread my angst and apathy fairly between the sexes. Misanthropic, sometimes, I admit-- but I'm working on it. I met a girl with whom it would never work out. I went out last night and talked in an Irish accent the whole night. Again. It's getting old (already) but let me tell you, hiding behind an accent does wonders for my social security. Really fills up the ol' chutzpah tank. The ability to create and use a character in public- Irish or otherwise- provides a certain element of security, a mask if you will, that allows one to do and say that which would otherwise be impossible. Tony could never be the boyishly charming, handsome devil that Irish-Tony-from-Dublin is. Well, everything but the handsome part. I have opened my eyes by shutting them.  Yes, I'm sober. Somber, even. And no, these guns aren't loaded. Guess you've realized by now that I'm playing Oedipus to your Oracle, and if you read this booger 'til the end you probably deserve a medal. There's a medal shortage on right now though, so I'll give you the next best thing: and end to this helter skelter email. Si quando in hic mundo bellam puellam invenit...Gloriem diam! Well, not sure about that last part. I was a lousy Latin student. You took Italian so you can probably get the gist of it, or at least the jest of it.    Arrivederci mi angelo,  T

						   Ed.'s note: The following is from a letter written by a good friend, Stacy. Being a Woman Herself, she should know what she's talking about. It has been edited for punctuation but otherwise left verbatum.   Girls are all the same. Give her just a little bit of fun and attention and then pull back again. Keep her wanting more and not getting it. That drives girls wild. Then when you know she is ready to have you and sacrifice for you, give her the whole thing. That is a girl's weakness. She needs to be wanted and when she feels she isn't getting that she will strive to earn it. If she is already wanted she will wander off to find someone else to want her. We are evil. We all want something new and exciting, something we can't have, and something everyone else wants. That is the bottom line of the good guys finish last scenario. You can get a good guy, but it is harder to get a player and it seems like the player has a lot of other people wanting him. Now that doesn't mean a girl wants a jerk. She wants a challenge that will then melt in her hands and let her feel like she has some power. Ok, so we are complicated creatures that play a few more games then men do. Men are a little easier, they want someone that will be a lady and look like a trophy and is fun to do a lot of activities with that will then go home behind closed doors and be a total slut. So, I guess if a girl can accomplish all of that she would be a catch. Unfortunately a lady is never a slut and a slut can't pretend to be a lady for very long.

						   Sadness o'er the sea of change                 Looks out towards the fiery fog; 	                            Roses spies he 'mongst the pain		 Whispering their hopeful dialogue.    	  Stepping out for the imposing peak		 Traversing the vast and friendless plain;         Echoing that voice that he hears speak            Of good and gloom in long refrain.                    	 	At the foot for to size 	Up the mount with weary eyes; 	Troubled is he by Wind that cries 	"Turn ye back, word to the wise"!                   Strength's been depleted by ceaseless gale Toiling against rock has made him weak; Deafened by distraction's constant wail Unable to find the soft spot he seeks.  Sadness unchanged tho' sorely dogged Yet stays his soul against the strain; Many more difficulties must be logged Before the peak he hopes to gain. 	 	Looks ahead- is demonstriz'd 	By bully Rock that belies 	What trouble beyond lies 	In the path to paradise.  Turning 'round there is nothing to see 'Tween heaven almighty and earth so frail; Neither rose nor red bends listening ear To what news of hardship his journey entails.             				  The mount, afar, bred hollow determination In a heart youthful and callously unfear'd; Now bravery's dethroned by resignation To lonely despair and it's manifest tear. 	 	Heart now sterilized 	Rose thought crystallized 	The truth, come to realize 	Is looking up at the skies!  No recourse but push on towards a dream For dying alone brings not salvation; Even goodness, sometimes, is not what it seems When heading for the land of re’onciliation.  Down to tall earth on still wind snow sails Lends to the silence an imperial theme; Drowsy, a tired traveler might hear it say "Now sing you a lullaby- sing I your requiem."				  	Hope is bent 	Soul is spent 	Curtain is rent 	Let me repent!  Sight gone with snow's soft silent regale On and on the path trips, winds its way; Rosy hope struggling- will it prevail? Against desperation's callous foray.  Presently the peak no longer daunts Across thick mist he barely can see Rocks, whose form on the shore haunt And past that his everbless'd salt sea!  	It's apparent 	He was sent 	With intent 	Most fervent 	 As ocean, salt tears roll down his face Never a sight more joyous could be; Love lead to that which is now embrace'd The sight of his everbless'd salt sea.  In seas of change is Sadness epilogue'd First life, now death, each joyously faced Roses were right, in their dialogue Whispering pain, but speaking of grace.

						   When the fair wind blows In spring, I'm carried wherever it goes; I sing. To see what the open road Will bring Is my consolation, my Only thing.   Free as the leaves, don't bother me Restless spirit wandering  When I feel the urge to cast A-way And head for the horizon, no Delay When I'm content at last I pray To find my journey's o'er Today  Free as the leaves, don't bother me Restless spirit wandering.   Something's tugging at my heartstrings Voiceless instinct, as in a dream Walking, running, I search for this thing That burns in my soul, my everything   Walking the roads alone  I see All to whom I have spoken, Believe Kindness in spirit is prone To be In those who are the Forsaken And Free  So long as I tramp I am Happy Ne'er overstaying my time, I flee; To find what the open road Will bring Is my consolation, my Only thing  Free as the leaves don’t bother me Restless spirit wandering  Someday I'll find what I'm looking for When that day comes, life will be o'er Against that time my hope's in store Peace at last, searching no more.  Free as the leaves, don’t bother me Restless spirit wandering.

						   Rain softly spatters the pavement two stories below, beating a quiet, steady rhythm that is at once inspiring and depressing; how good it feels to see the world washed of its sin, to accept the tranquility imminently offered by nature's downpour and the heart's consequent outpour. But as the breast swells to the rinsing of the rain, what wasted chances in sunny days past are remembered!  The trickle, the stream, the rushing and gushing as soft silent drizzle drowns the floodgates of a memory burdened with its task of forgetting too slowly.  Love is a master of his craft, changing faces even with the changing faces of nature; the giddy child of this morning's bright-hot sunrise, the wizened elder that just this evening came knocking at your conscience; beating a quiet, steady rhythm- let me in, let me in- as you sit and listen to the rain.

						   Sitting alone, I have naught to do But take it in stride and think of you. Raven's hair, tight with curls Bluest eyes, that's my girl; Sunset cheeks on freckled face Her heart with mine is interlaced.  Death, if ever our bond is broken! Upon that oath I pledge my token Of love. At times it may not show So I tell you now, that you may know I plan to hold you all my days Your heart and mine are interlaced.  Solitude had been my friend- He and I to the bitter end. Then I left him for another Remember me, Oh my Brother; Forgive me but I've found my place Her heart and mine are interlaced.  Mindy I want to apologize For falling short in your eyes All the times a piece of your heart I've torn off and shredded apart. I have them here: 'twasn't a waste Because our hearts are interlaced.  If you'll have me, take my hand I'll show you life, all that I can I want you to find in me All the things in you I see Together we'll journey to that place You and I-- we're interlaced.

						   S,  I love how this world works if one allows it to. It's a quarter of eleven Sunday night and I checked my email thinking that I should write you because it's been so long since we've talked, I shouldn't neglect friends like that, and I know you don't write unless it's your turn. Well guess who shows up in my inbox. I am more than a little moved, as well as awestruck. Since we've been off of our daily routine, let me bring you up to speed: I spent four days worriedly cramming for my real estate exam, which I sat for and passed with flying colors last Tuesday morning; I've been engrossed in applications and interviews the past two weeks; in the middle of last week, after zero success in the job hunt, I came very, very near to selling everything I own to buy a sailboat in San Diego, move to Southern Cali maybe build houses for awhile to make money, then take off for Hawaii by way of Cabo San Lucas, where I have a contact. Well Thursday I scored an interview and an hour into it they made an offer I couldn't refuse. So as of Friday I work for the biggest real estate company in central Texas. Now that may sound like a lot, but my life has felt surprisingly slow these past couple days, which makes me wonder if it's the whole life-passing-before-my-eyes routine and I'm dying slowly-- maybe I shouldn't have postponed the dream just to stick my hand in the cookie jar. Considering in the last year and a half I've turned into a worrier extraordinaire, that kind of doubt makes for good bedtime contemplation. Oh and I got a cat. Named Cat. Or kitty-kitty, or stinkin' cat, or blackstuff, or whatever comes to mind when it goes to nibbling on my toes expecting breakfast at five. So you get a new schedule, an extra day off to work on the house and really put down roots, grow, whatever you want to call it, and 250 miles and a lifetime away, I pick up the slack and start working six days a week full time. There is a rhythm to this world-- you just have to stop listening so hard in order to hear it. Well Sunday is the day of rest and that's just what I've done. I don't feel particulary rich in the coin of the spirit, nor particulary poor. I'm not sure yet if I've done the right thing, but I've done something and that, when your name is Tony West, is most of the time all that you can ask. I Can't tell you, babe, how fine it is to hear from you, and I was honestly about to write! Now that you have more time, you should visit; and when I come to my senses and pull stakes for parts unknown I'll be sure to stop by and see you on my way out. Kinda like agreeing to get married at 25 if nothing else comes along. It was Herman Melville who said, "Do not forsake the dreams of thy youth." When I was young I had a new dream every week; happiness was doing it all. These days I wish I could do something- anything- productive, since happiness tends to be fleeting at best. And I may get the chance yet: all anyone has to do is stop listening so hard and let things happen. I promise I'll write more often.  Yours,  Tony

						   Like teardrops in the wind I'm cold and I don't know why The silence seems to testify That I'll never see you again

						   Dull, aching pain has wrought its woe Throughout the deeds of my life; I have embraced the slippery foe And for it I get the knife.  Long did I stand By the works of my hands And now those hands, they stab me.  The world I met was full of strife Sheltered though I may have been; In my youth my mind was rife With thoughts of how I might sin. Long have I stood On hill and in wood And now those woods won't have me.  From the outset I have looked for the end But the end, it is elusive; My life as it were, has been a condemned One of a search most fruitless. Heaven or Hell? The which I guessed well Because Hell is where you've found me.

						   You cannot draw wrath  From me, a wrath- less being in your presence: You in my mind with; Go away.

						   I avoid you now, since The aura is lost. You Provide nothing; in fact Defile the memory of us. Insult me-- &nbsp;I take it.

						   You make me feel unwanted  I am an intruder, and  Hospitality is an euphemism  for guilt? Memory.   &nbsp;
