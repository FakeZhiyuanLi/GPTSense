       Whew! Sorry guys, haven't been writing in a while...Things just got so crazy, ya know? I got two CCAs and they constantly clash so that I have to miss one CCA and the hardest part is choosing..because I enjoy St. John and I enjoy choir, so I don't like missing out on either one...That sucks..Like what happened today...They were having a rehearsal for choir, you know, because we're performing at some concert or other...it's from 2pm - 4pm. There is a rehearsal for the parade next Friday, and I have to do public duty (That means I stand around with a First-Aid bag and wait for somebody to faint so I can go save them), and that starts at 3.15pm. Ends around 5. OK. So this means I have to either miss my choir and leave at 3pm so I can fall in on time, or I can miss St. John and rehearse with the choir. I picked St. John, 'cause that's better than dancing. NOT! They said I have to stand in senang diri (is that how you spell it?) position THROUGHOUT my duty. Duty being standing there watching to see if any of the Girl Guides isn't feeling well (It's a parade, all the uniformed groups are taking part, including the band). Now, the thing ya gotta know about the heels of my SJ boots is that they are hard. And that sole is a piece of fabric,&nbsp;y'all.&nbsp;It's like wood. Imagine standing on wood for half an hour non-stop, without moving. Barefoot. Now your feet are going to hurt if you stand on that wood too long. WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, GOTDAMMIT!!!!! How the fuck do they expect us to stand there for almost half an hour without moving, talking, or drinking water? Fuck them (our NCOs)!! Both of them are gay, y'all. They  catwalk  up to us and scream at us when we don't respond when they're screaming. Fuckers.

       Hi yall..I am starting a brand new bloggie. I hate my old one, it totally sucks, all about me complaining. Well all right I complain in like every bloggie/diary I ever had but this is The New Bloggie. The Nats Page. The beginning of the end. The end of the old Nats. A new blog, a new day, a new Nats. I don't think I'll be able to keep my bloggie for long, not like Van. Van writes almost daily. I am the sort of person who is too fucking lazy to keep a bloggie or a diary. You would not believe how many times I have tried. Really. Countless.  Countless.  I only write when something really memorable happens, something that upset me or hurt me, or if I upset someone else. Or just when I feel like writing. I usually write loads, when I do. Note that I said write, not type, because I meant literally. I find writing easier, because I can write any time I want to, whereas if I were to be a bloggie person, I wouldn't be able to write every day, not only because my mother has got the password thing going again, but also because I don't always have something to say. I am not like that bitch Valencia. She is so tactless. Anyway. I bought four new books from Kino. Spend like almost all of my savings. I got the Prince DVD, Rave Un2 The Year 2000. It was this new year thing...I want to get all of his albums and all of his concert DVDs. I don't care how much money I have to spend, how many days I have to starve at school, how many arguments I might have with my mother. It'll be worth it. I seriously enjoy every one of his songs that I've heard so far. That's a first. I have never enjoyed all of the songs on anybody's album before. I thought Stacie Orrico was good, which is she is, but she only has one album, and although I did like all of the songs on it, there is no one like Prince. I love him. You know how people throw that word around so much, until it's lost its meaning? Well..I think Prince is the only singer I've ever really loved. The only one with all the albums with all the songs that I like. All. I did not say I was IN love with him, I said I love him. You can love anybody. Prince is a genius. I can't believe the people he's worked with. Except Carmen Electra, formerly known as Tara Patrick. I&nbsp;like his choice of names, when he gave her hers. He's so talented and so hot. And SUCH a genius. There are no words, yall...there are no words.    Some people think I'm a lesbian. Because my old man brought me up not to be afraid to display affection in public, I think I sort of thought everybody felt the same way, so on Tuesday when I went to Cine with Van, and she had to go and I was gonna stay and watch a movie with my mother, and I hugged her and kissed her goodbye. (On the cheek, of course! Ugh..) OK like I hugged and kissed her a lot of times, and on the way home my mother said to me, next time don't do that, people will think you're a lesbian. And that was it. She just dropped it. Like I used to drop the nuggets at McDonald's when I was younger, because it was hot. God..well. It don't mean nothin to me. It's just...a hug. In America girls hug their girlfriends. And just because I hug mine don't mean I'm a homo. Lord..

       How does Oprah talk to so many people and not get bored after a while? How does any body interview any body and not get bored? I mean it's like one question leads to another one, and you totally sidetrack and it drags on and on and on. Wow. I think people who do this, especially on TV, have to..um..sort of edit their laugh until it's just right. I don't think anyone really notices laughs. Is it really so insignificant? Like, it's so hard to decide on a laugh. I have millions of them. OK...why did I just run out of things to say? God...I wish I could just be honest about myself, like other people can. But this isn't a diary, this is a bloggie. It's on the Internet. Anyone can read it. It's not private any more. Maybe I shouldn't write about me in this bloggie. I went to a bloggie by this woman living in Egypt and stuff...see there are so many other things I could be writing about, instead of my life.
