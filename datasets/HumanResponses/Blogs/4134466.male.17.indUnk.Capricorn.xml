       is touching.   Catched sg idol just now... I think tt damm well explain why my work is behind time. Haa.. anyway, today's esp. of singapore idol is touching. I bet those who catch it too will understand my feeling. Unless that dude is heartless!!! I personally like the part where the guy with speech defect challenged himself, to prove to the whole world that impossible is nothing. His ego, confidence n courage is something i admire.  ... I did not catch the banana man in action ... =(  Ah.. amazing race is right at 10. nvm, i not watching le.

       err.. shit! i'm lagging behind with my work. Behind time already. Damm.. and i still have thousand and one undone things waiting for me to finish. Haa.. is it really that bad?? No, i don really think so!! I'm slacking la.. and i have slack too much. Gotta find back my motivation. I think i need a studying partner, to keep myself focus. And i am still jealous that secondary school kids don needa attend school on tuesday. To hell with those kids.. =X       Spent good weekend spent in the mountains, tress n waterfall.. Berkelah is quite a nice place, expect the fact tt u see too much rubbish around.. When u arrive at any camp site, u see rubbish, rubbish and still rubbish... and it is quite a turn off for me.. I never got to try the confidence jump.. the ard 2 story height one i mean.. due to the fact tt e SPA says it is too dangerous.. which i think is a bunch of crap!! Well, i do admit tt SPA has lots of crappy rules..      Perhaps, i shld try and understand the position the of the committee. they are partly responsible for our safety too.. But one thing for sure is that their crappy rules and the style of their formal way of doing things has decrease the fun-ness throughout the trek.. But nevertheless, i like the way they play icebreaker games before the trip and the camp songs we sang.      Each club has it own pro n cons, I am happy to experience a different way another club organise and carry out their trip.       My entries r boring, yeah... i know
