      This weekend we received news that our peeper is a real, real psycho. He's been trying to get into our apartment through our front door -- NO JOKE. Apparently he's been jiggling our doorknob at night and only really on weekends, but of course our door can't be monitored 24/7 so Lord knows if he's done it more. Also, he only does it when we're home, meaning he knows our cars and he keeps tabs on us during the day. To what extent, we don't know, but this is seriously sick. Our front door is lit up like a Christmas tree since it is a thoroughfare to other apartments on our floor. We're talking those really, really ugly fluorescent lights that make every flaw stick out times ten. Also, our apartment is close to the leasing office at the front of the complex. You would think we're safe, right?!?! The guys upstairs caught him jiggling the doorknob before and shoo'd him away. They also think that they know who the guy is -- well, sort of. He lives across the courtyard -- they think -- and they have seen him driving around. We're going to at least get a car description, but what if it isn't him and just some other guy? We don't want to harass some guy because he drives a certain car and happens to be a Black man -- no, that's wrong. So my roommate and I are stuck -- we're honestly stuck. He tries to get in when we're home in our illuminated hallway and Lord knows what he wants to do if he gets in. We can't live like this! We're going to the police station tomorrow and looking into what we can do. Also, we want to talk to the neighbors to see if we can get more of a description. What do we do? Honestly, what the heck do we do?

      Um, yeah, if I was a Laker, I would be embarrassed. You know that a game is bad when fans such as myself are saying, "I wonder if we can make it a 30-point lead!" The Lakers really had no chance -- we played with more unity, more heart, with a coach that cares (is Phil Jackson ever in the game?), and in the end we proved that a full house ALWAYS beats two pair. :) The Lakers may have good players on their team, but when they were up against a team that can play both offense AND defense and isn't afraid to tackle the toughest players in the game, the Pistons proved to have the best combination this year (and hopefully) in years to come. There really isn't more that can be said except for "the Motor City Bad Boys are back and badder than ever!"   Oh, and one final note -- what was with Aretha lip syncing the National Anthem? She didn't even do it well! I mean, duh, she obviously recorded it at one time, but lip syncing your own rendition of the National Anthem and not being able to keep up with the highs and lows and carried notes? Maybe Miss Aretha should take some lessons from the finest lip syncers of our time -- Britney Spears and Milli Vanilli, anyone?

      While in line at Taco Bell today -- I went inside, the drive-thru was snaking around the building clogging up the parking lot. Nice planning on the part of Taco Bell. Anyway, the couple in front of me with their granddaughter was remarking that the service was slow. Listening to the orders of everyone I figured out why -- most orders were insanely specialized! This one guy ordered two bean burritos with no cheese, extra sauce, and lettuce. Another guy ordered two of those Ranchero Chicken Tacos, both done in two different ways. Then, this gal walks up asking if she could have her salad "fixed" because there was some sort of sauce on it. Fixed? You mean thrown out and a new one prepared, right? So anyway, the couple is remarking that it's slow and what do they order? A Ranchero Chicken Taco with the sauce on the side, a salad made this-a-way and that-a-way with sauce on the side and none of something-or-other, and then two of some burrito minus onions and beans. Now comes the part where I roll my eyes. Fast food is supposed to be fast! Anything that strays from routine with fast food causes a few seconds to be added onto the final preparation time and no wonder people complain. Once the non-specialized orders made it through, orders were being completed at lightning speed. Anyway, I'm just griping because I had to wait for a simple order because some people are too damn picky about their fast food. Seriously, if you want food the way you want it, go someplace where you sit down and pay more for that kind of thing. Don't cause a bottleneck at my Taco Bell!

      Hey, y'all! Everyone always says to "appreciate the simple things in life." What do I view as simple? Washing my car, or should I say detailing my car (I guess that's the proper terminology when you clean the heck out of the car inside and out). I spent almost 3 hours washing, vacuuming, windexing, carpet shampooing, and even Rain-Xing (which rocks, by the way). I did all of this at my dad's house back in E'ville. I can't wait until I have a driveway and a garage so I can do all of this at home, but until then it's mooching off of my parents' houses/garages/driveways. :)   I'm slightly bummed because no one is home tonight. My friends back at home are all out of town, but that's okay. It's just me and my dog tonight (who is sleeping right now, by the way, he'd better wake up because I'm bored). I did bring a book home and I can always go out and buy a smut magazine. I think there is a new InStyle out, hmm.   So my boyfriend told me a new term for those people who love the UofM Wolverines and flank themselves in everything blue and gold, yet never attended the school, nor ever had the intention. These are also the same people that flagrantly throw out phrases, like, "MSU sucks! Green blows!" and "UofM is a real school!" Umm, yeah, so what college did you attend? You didn't attend UofM? Oh, that's right, living in the state is good enough. I forgot that rule! Silly, silly me. I love college sport bandwagoning. Anyway, he told me that these people can be referred to as "Wal-Mart Wolverines." I know, cute huh? I had a pair of these WW's giving me the finger and pointing at me saying, "State sucks!" as I was driving back to Lansing a few months ago. Yeah, two winners driving in a beat-up F-150 with NASCAR and, go figure, UofM crap all over the car. Since then I have been really noticing a lot of WW's. I'm shocked that they are football fans given their hockey-haircut of choice. :) Interesting, those of us who did attend large universities or have a tame appreciation for the schools don't plaster their vehicles with stickers, flags, and more stickers, but maybe have one thing regarding our alma mater posted. We also own only a few articles of clothing with the school, not a whole closet full. If anyone should go bucknutty it should be us, but no, we're not that overt.   Anyway, my dog just woke up so we're going for a walk. I feel so bad for him sometimes -- he's an arthritic lapdog with thinning fur, yet he still likes power walks in the backyard. :)

      The lead-in article on CNN.com today was for former-President Ronald Reagan's wake. At this hour (12a) if I were to pull up CNN.com I would see an image of Nancy Reagan and the priest who was present at the service they held earlier. However, if I were to have visited the site, saaaaaaay around 6p I would have seen these total backwoods mullet shorn males in procession around Reagan's casket. No joke! Out of the 2000+ people/hour projected to proceed past that casket today they had to post the image of two mulletted guys and another guy who I suspect has a mullet hidden under his hat. If that isn't a wahoo-how-ya-doin' to middle America and a big, fat "SCORE"! to hockey-hair, I don't know what is. All that was missing was the Canadian tuxedo, aka denim jacket and matching jeans, but would that have been appropriate? No, apparently the t-shirt and ripped jeans selected for the occasion were, though. :(

      Okay, so I have a great idea in dealing with our peeper -- my website. :) Whaaaat!?!? Here's my idea ... my dad has a few X10 cameras at home. No, my dad isn't into peeping or stalking, but a few months ago he was going to place the X10 cameras in my grandpa's house so he could keep an eye on him during the day. As a bit of background, my grandpa has dementia and is showing early signs of Alzheimer's, if he isn't there already. My grandma died a few years ago and since then it's been my dad and grandpa. He said to me, "He took care of me for 20 years, the least I can do is take care of him now." Okay, back to my dad and the cameras at grandpa's house. He was going to use them to setup a site so that he could monitor grandpa in possible dangerous places in the house -- the stairway from the garage to the house, kitchen, living room, etc. He just wanted to make sure grandpa was safe and didn't fall and hurt himself. The site would also be secure (no peeping on the Grandpa Cam!). Anyway, that plan was short lived because it was a lot of work, but I think it was a great idea if it would have worked. Okay, seriously, I'm making a connection now. So my dad has a few of these cameras. I was thinking of snagging one the next time I was home and putting it up in a window of our apartment. I believe that they function with motion so any detected motion would be caught on camera -- voila, we have the Peeper Cam. Good idea, eh?  So my roommate found out that we're not the only ones getting peeped upon. Our neighbor was at the pool the other day and overheard two gals talking about a peeper. He said that they weren't alone and mentioned our apartment. Our neighbor is dead-set on catching this yahoo and I think it's awesome. Our neighbors all around us are looking out for us -- aww! :)   My final talking point for the night -- what on earth is that sicko thinking peeping into our apartment? I mean, seriously -- right now I'm at my computer in front of a window (blinds drawn) and my hair is all over the place, no makeup, Crest Whitestrips in my mouth, and I have the same stinky t-shirt and shorts that I walked in yesterday morning. How is that hot!?! :) It's not like my roommate and I are STREAKING! Hahaha -- maybe later, jk. Or, I know, maybe the guy has a cat fetish. My roommates kitties are adorable and rather fun to watch, especially when they try to be all rough-and-tough and beat each other up. All out of love, I tell ya. Anyway, my point is -- how are chicks like us appealing when we're just schleping around the apartment? So that ends my thought for the day. Outtie!

      My roommate found out from some of our neighbors upstairs (three guys, thankfully all police officers or officers-in-training) that we have a Peeping Tom. Every few nights at 1-2a this guy creeps around our apartment windows trying to look in. My roommate and I have yet to see this -- thankfully since we would probably crap ourselves -- but we are really scared now. The guys upstairs have scared him away a few times. Since they are police officers or soon-to-be, they know the law and really there isn't anything that we can do since the Peeper hasn't really done anything yet aside from peering into our windows. My roommate's dad is also a retired police officer. The guys upstairs have told a few neighbors around us so that someone could snag a description -- right now apparently it is just a big, African-American man which doesn't really get us very far.  What scares us most is that my roommate and I feel really safe in our new apartment. The corridors between apartment are well lit (four apartments on a floor, two floors, corridors are outside) and the parking lots are well lit and we see police cars patroling once in awhile. However, now that I look at it, the back of our building faces the backs of other buildings and it's dark. There are a few picnic tables back there and some trees, but that's it. It's a recreational area where neighbors kids play so it's kind of big. Anyway, the guys upstairs said that the Peeper sits out on the picnic table and stares at our apartment sometimes.   So we're stuck. What do we do? What can we do? Probably nothing unless the guy attempts something, but still, we don't want it to come to that. Also, it's hard to sleep knowing that you may see a shadow walking around outside. I'm half-tempted to put up those cardboard cut-outs of Boba Fett and Marilyn Monroe in our windows so that he gets a surprised when he looks in. Or, post a sign that says, "Stop looking at us, you psycho!" or "Hey asshole, quit your peepin'!" As it gets warmer outside, it's nice to keep our windows open at night, but now I don't think we'll be doing that. We are scared because we're two innocent girls that could scrap if we needed to, but not against some big guy who is how sick in the head or determined to get into our apartment to do Lord knows what. It's one thing to have an Internet stalker -- a totally different one to have someone appearing in your windows in the middle of the night.

      A few years ago I setup my friend and my now roommate on a blind date. Early on during the date they were talking when he said, and to this day I'm not sure what he was thinking, but he says, "You need to treat the good girls like sluts, and the sluts like good girls!" Needless to say, Date #2 never happened. Anyway, I was just thinking about that and I had to share! :)  So this afternoon I went to do my duty in the bathroom. I didn't drop the kids off a the pool or anything, but as I walked into the bathroom did it ever smell like there was a party in the pool! Gross! Okay, so I suck it up and go in stall #2 which just happened to be where the pool with the stinky kids was located. No no no, the kids still weren't in the pool -- they went down the waterslide -- but you just knew. Anyway, I do my business and leave, but just as I walk out of the stall to the sink to wash my hands (those of you who don't, especially in public bathrooms, may all of the germs left on your hands come back to haunt you), a lady from another office comes into the bathroom, makes a face, and goes into a stall. She thought that I dropped the kids off at the pool and destroyed the precious air circulating within the bathroom! NOOOOOO! Okay, now honestly, how do I recover from that? I am nearly 99% sure that the person dropping off the kids was the elderly lady who destroys the bathroom everyday between 1p and 2p -- good God, what is that woman eating? Leftover Chi-Chi's from 1992? Anyway, I know that this lady is in the same office as the elderly lady so I just want to laydown the law and say, "Yeah, it's the old codger with the fluffy hair and the pea-green CTS in the parking lot. She's destroys the bathroom everyday and you know it!" but yeah, like I can do that. If I did, I would be the snotty young girl from the software company who thinks that she is soooo perfect when it comes to proper bathroom etiquette. Oh, meow meow meow, at least sewage doesn't come out of my body in a public restroom causing the rest of the public to suffer. So I left the bathroom being labeled as "that girl." Fan-frickin'-tastic.

      Today's entry is a snotty rant that I pared down a bit as to not sound so mean, but you can probably sense the hoity-toity undertone.   My roommate and I just moved into a new apartment -- it's cute, safe, well-run, and before we moved in the place was spotless and had really nice Berber carpet freshly installed. However, the more we live here, the more we come to find out that we live in Kid Central. Everyday when we get home from work (5p-6p, approximately) there are always kids running around outside. They are chucking footballs at our building (boom! boom!), running through the corridors between the apartments, up and down stairs, through the parking lots -- anywhere you can place a foot, they are there. Wow, and loud -- I don't think that my neighbors and I were that loud when we were kids. What is even more annoying is the one gal, one of the mom's. She blasts Celine Dion every Saturday morning and it's bad. I mean, seriously, have a little respect. Then one morning she comes out of her apartment just as my friend and I were leaving and she asks, "Did you have the wild party last night? If so, my kid was up all night." First of all, it was the guys above us and given that we have balconies and they are the only other apartment in back besides the people above her, you would think she could have figured this out on her own that night and called the cops or went up there and said something. Secondly, you don't hear the rest of us complaining about your choice of adult contemporary music and kids on crack, do you? Geeeez, maybe we should throw in the fact that her kids plus others treat the parking lot like a playground and that any dings made to my car will be highly suspect if a foot or two high off the ground. Or mention the mom and daughter who have yelling matches every morning at 730am as the daughter is going to school and the mom is hollering, "Keep your mouth shut and don't piss off your teacher!" Aye carumba. Now I don't mind kids entirely -- the well-behaved ones that know better than to wander because a child of age 7 shouldn't have to be tethered, or not to disrupt the peace because karma is a bitch -- and I know that they can't control where they live, but even when the parents are outside they think it's funny. I know that the summer will only get worse as school is out of session. I don't expect these parents to put their kids in swim lessons, tennis clinics, community education courses, take vacations, or even give them chores to do during the day -- we're in an apartment complex, you can't expect many people to have the means -- I just hope that I'm not awakened at 7a on a Saturday to the sound of little feet and the Titanic theme song. We also live close to the pool which is always a homing beacon for kids. I already told my friend Ali that I plan on sunning myself by her pool since she lives in a condo community with elderly women and their cats. :) I'm not very tolerant, I'm not very accomodating, but I'm not going to disrupt the peace -- I have a feeling I'm going to snap one day, though. I'll probably make some snotty comment about children being brought up in a barn or say that I have a friend who eats children and they better beware, the latter being the more amusing one. I can put up with a little bit of hell until winter comes around again. I'm just adding some future requirements before I have any kids -- a house, a big yard, and summer swimming and tennis lessons. :)

      Welcome to my first step in my blogging journey. I'm not sure that this will fly with me since I get pretty flaky when it comes to committing to something like a blog, but I figure that I've kept up with my website this long that I should be able to do this -- yeah right. :) Anyway, we'll see!  Well how exciting is this ... the Pistons just won the Eastern Conference! Sweet! :) I remember the last time (well, few times) that the Pistons won the NBA Championship. My brother had, like, every t-shirt you could buy with John Salley, Joe Dumars, and Bill Laimbeer emblazoned on the front. I also remember going to the training camps at SVSU as a kid. Wow, that was a crazy long time ago. Now I can say, where was I when the Pistons won the Eastern Conference in 2004? Writing my blog. Good lord, how ridiculous does that sound? Well, you're reading it so I guess that speaks heaps for the both of us -- haha.   I really don't have much to talk about right now, so let's talk about Target. Target is my favorite store not because of the couture (haha, that's a joke -- Target couture?), but you can get everything cool at Target! Today I picked up allergy meds, a few girl products that I will not disclose, indoor tanning lotion (because I believe in getting skin cancer, 'natch), and a two-piece bathing suit for $30. $30, I tell you! Also, the store provides what I will now refer to as "perusal entertainment" since I like to go to Target to peruse the aisles in search of, well, whatever I feel like buying on a whim. I also have my boyfriend loving Target. My greatest Target purchase of recent? Two garden stones with the word "Paradise" on each. I gave them to my parents for their gardens at home and they were only $3 apiece. Finally, my last Target accolade -- the clientele isn't as sketchy as the clientele at Wal-Mart. Yeah, don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about because you know that you do. I am convinced that there is a group of people who hangout solely at Wal-Mart 24/7 and their only purposes in life are to freak the heck out of anyone who enters the store who isn't one of them. I have learned quite a bit about Wal-Mart politics in the last few months I'm really not a fan of the store anyway, but I figure if I at least go there and walk around, I shouldn't hear for my well-being.   Well, that's about it for me today! Maybe I'll write more later this evening, but I'm thinking this is it for entry #1. Thanks for reading! I hope that you found it entertaining -- hey you in the back, if you're going to sleep at least close your browser, thanks.
