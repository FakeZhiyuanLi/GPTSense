       Wow, after 11 years of mandatory school, I have now finished it all.  Only my final GCSE's to go and then I can do what I want and not what I HAVE to.  I'm going to college, going to do a National Diploma in media, so it should be good.  I'm looking forward to meeting new people, although weary and nervous at the same time.  It should be fun.  I'm hoping everything turns out great for everyone that went to West Leeds, and I hope everyone gets what they worked so hard for.  I will especially miss my 'group', and it's been a great experience to meet such different people.  It's been an eye opener and I won't ever forget High School -- it's been great and I won't ever deny that.

       Me and fallen (from #model_design), have decided to join the competition over at  urlLink CGChat  this month.  The competition requires a base model (1200), and two varients, with different polycounts (I believe 1420, and 1600).  Fallen has drawn the concept, and I've been working on the model.  Hopefully we can get it done :).  Today I managed to make a head, because I still can't do the fucking arms (Not sure why, just a big stumbling block, aka a wall).  I also worked on the  urlLink smoothing groups  because I got bored and couldn't be arsed even trying with the arms ;)  I've uploaded some pictures in a browsable so any people can see;  urlLink here .   GCSE's :  So far I've done 4 exams; IT (Higher), German (Foundation, Speaking & Listening), along with English (Higher, Literature).  IT:  This went quite well, only a small segment on sensors got me, but I feel I did enough.  German:  I struggle with German anyway, but I feel I've done okay with them, and the best to my ability.  English:  This was tough and I feel I could have done better, although I'm hoping it will be okay in the long run :)

       The other day I decided I want to play some console fun.  In the house we have both the PS2 and the Gamecube.  The PS2 isn't chipped, so I'd be paying for legit games for either, so the choice wasn't decided in price.  I then decided I love the gamecube controller (I don't care what anyobe says, it beats the PS2), and I think the console is cute and a great gaming system.  So I decided to splash some money out on it (We had: Spiderman, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and Bomberman).  I like spiderman, but it's annoying.  Crash Bandicoot was probably the best thing we had, the rest suck completly. I was bored of crash, as it wasn't my type of game really, I just played it as it was the next best thing.  I took £20 to Toys'R'Us, seeing WWE Wrestling X8 for £5 (Bargain!), and anything else they had there, that was £15 or less.  Got down there with the thought of buying either Metroid Prime (!!), or XIII.  They had MP at £20 :/ and XIII at £13 :)  On a side-note I went halves on a memory card with my mum, and she got Formula F1 2002 (£5) for my brother and my dad.  XIII is a rocking game and I am thoroughly enjoying it, as I thought I would.  Wrestling is also a good game and well worth £5.  I'm now scrounging on Ebay trying to pick Metroid Prime up for cheap ;)

       I've been watching BigBrother recently, and I quite like it this year.  Varied people, with some hotties such as Vanessa and Shell.  I'm so glad kitten is gone, she gave arguments but never listened to peoples response, and when she did - disliked the fact that it wasn't the same opinion as herself.  Now Ahmed, recently they were on about Home, and what he calls home (Just so you know, he's an asylum seeker).  He said "Home is where you feel home, and I feel at home in England".  Now Ahmed is NOT English/British, whatever.  He's an import in my eyes and will be for the forseeable future.  He's only been here 8 years, and still CAN'T speak English with confidence.  Ok,  he speaks better English than I can his country, but I aren't in his country claiming money off the government.  In my eyes, people like him shouldn't be given a vote.  If they're getting money that's still not fine, but I'll let it rest.  A vote shouldn't be given to every Tom, Dick & Harry, and their dogs.  My exams are going alright, English was probably my best so far with Maths being the hardest exam I've ever sat.

       Bring it on.  I've got one more GCSE to go, and after that I'm done with mandatory school.  Doesn't really affect me as I'm going to college, but none the less, the feel of not HAVING to go is cool :)  England are through to the Quarter-Finals with a 4-2 victory over Croatia, with Rooney bagging 2.  We're now going to play Portugal, and what a game it should be, looking forward to it.  Off to Disneyland with school on the 23rd or something, and I'm looking forward to it.  It's gonna be my first time on a ferry :)

       My higher tier schooling has finished, and mandatory education for me is over... for good :D  I've got to go in tomorrow for my record of achievement, but that'll be the last day.    Got a TV a little over an hour ago too, my old one popped, so we went out and go a 20", with a remote!! :)  I didn't get back in time to watch all of CSI though, but I watched most of it.  Was interesting, as always really, and I found out about some rare condition where you have two 'DNAs' in your body, because you're two people, and they died 'in you'.  Odd I know, and hard to explain.  France is a little over 2 weeks away, and I should be getting my camera tomorrow!  Rock on!
