      This is my first blog so if it sucks I am sorry. Finals are over school on the other hand is not. I have to go to summer school cause I need to have two years of P.E. I have only taken one. Over the weekend I just hung out with my boyfriend will and some friends. Last night was graduation it was fun seeing my friends off. My brother on the other hand lck himself out of his car. I tried to help butwas unable to and he got mad. me and all my friends had planed on going to the movies to see harry potter, my brother thought they were going but they wern't wanted and nobody said they could go. He was mad cause liz's mom called and wanted her home and she thought she was going to the movies. Thought will had told her mom that she was going to the movies so chris got mad at me cause she had to go home. Oh well the movie was ok the first two I say were better today I thik we are going bowling later but I am not sure. Oh ya my brother says he will never give me a ride again cause of that.

      It has been a while since I have posted anything. This weekend I went camping with my brother, will, Liz, Jackie, and Sal. It was fun but I got in trouble because my mom found out that will went and my punishment has not yet been decided. I am scared to know what it is, but it was worth it I had a great time. Our camp site was great it had a space under the tree's to set up the tents. There was this dog there that was lost I think and followed us were ever we went. To much drama going on. Tyler (cousin) went to a party this weekend and got fucked up, and his brother Jordan made out with Tyler's ex, not something you do Tyler was pissed. Why dose everything have to go down this way. On the way back from camping me and will both got car sick because we were in the back with a whole bunch of blankets. Well that's it for now I hate being in trouble.

      This Saturday my mom and stepdad are going camping, so I will be home by myself which is good because I am grounded so I am going to have will come over. My mom has not yet told me how long I am grounded for but I am not going to bug her about it cause she will get mad at me and it might turn into a longer time. I have not seen will in 4 days now and I miss him. All I hope is that my brother Chris dose not tell on me cause he will be home this weekend to. Well I have to get back to work now. Till next time whenever that is.

       Yea I am so bored lately because I am still grounded and that sucks my mom might let me off this fri but I don't know. I hope she dose so do something. But she says I will be off before the fair so that's good. In about 2 months I am moving out with will and my brother cause I cant stand getting in trouble any more and a stupid curfew. I cant wait until I get off grounded so I can hang out with will and all my friends, I miss seeing them all. Well I got to get back to work.

Done I hope it looks good. Next tues. Is orientation Why does school have to start so soon. I will be at the fair the whole week because I have family doing 4-H down there. Will got his LICENSE!!!! It is about time if I do say so myself. His car though is a stick and he does not know how to drive a stick so he wants me to teach him how. I don't know if I am going to be good at teaching him but we will see if not Chris can teach him cause he thought me how to drive a stick. On sat. The 28 I am going to marine world unless will got the days mixed up, then we cant cause I got school. Well I got to get back to work and do nothing and be bored.
