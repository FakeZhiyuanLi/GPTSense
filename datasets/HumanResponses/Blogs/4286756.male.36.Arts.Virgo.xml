      music creates order out of chaos,for rhythum imposes humanity upon the divergent,melody imposescontinuity upon the disjointed,and harmony imposes compatability upon the incongruous, this is confusion surrendering to order ,and noise to music. we through music attain that greater universal order whitch reasts upon fundimental relationships of geometrical and mathmatical  proportions, music influences the rhythems of mans thoughts,the melody of mans emotions,and the harmony of his bodily health and mannor of movment,(as in music so in life) music magnatizes sociaty intointo conformaty ,music is the bassis for everything ,wean music is altered sociaty itself is altered,music is a tangible force that can be applied to create change, do you get it know ,
