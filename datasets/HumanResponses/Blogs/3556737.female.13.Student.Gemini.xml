      prince i'm looking forward of meeting you, but i don't know you, please give me a clue. you may be mr. right, but not mr. perfect, i'll always remember our love i will not wreck.  oh my prince, please show me your presence, or maybe i'll smell your beautiful essence. i don't know if your far or near, i just really hope you're here my dear.  even though you have a  masculine body, your attitude must not be like shady. he's like a dorky boy, who hates his mother, he treats his parents like "the other"  the end....

      it's rainy season here. It's really good to just lay in bed and sleep. For me, that's first on my boring list. I'm not use to sleeping in afternoon. I have a lot of things to do, sleeping is like as important as playing. Well, sleeping is really good for us, but i don't like doing it. Really boring here. I wish i have my own internet, so everyday i will surf the net. Woohoo. But i only dream of it.   Bu-bye, dessa

      Today, we watched catch that kid in video, but i already watched it in theatres, anyways. My dad thought that me and vj didn't watched it yet, so he rented it. I wanna watch Pirates of the Carribeans (i'm not sure if this is the right spelling of "carribeans", but what the heck). It's a humorous and action film, (i guess). I wanted to watch Shrek 2, too. But i have the feeling we have to wait for it's dvd release, lol. It's okay. DUH!  that's all bu-bye! ...dessa...

      I know. It's not really right the way i watched all the Potter movies. Well, the first movie i watched was the Sorcerer's Stone in dvd. Then, i watched Prisoner of Azkaban in theatres. Finally, i watched Chamber of Secrets in video/vcr. Is there something wrong with me? Nope, as far as i know i'm still normal.   Well, i think that the second movie of Harry Potter was the coolest. It's because of his face. He was more cuter than before.  More experience than before. And gained more talent than before. So cute. How did he do that? Well, i know one thing. He is really handsome....

      Today, we watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It was so cool. I love Dan's movie, he was more mature, taller, and braver in the third movie compared to the first movie. This movie was the best, i hoped it never ended. His voice was much more darker than before. Puberty....   I believe in the forth movie he (Daniel Radcliffe) will have a romantic story with Cho Chang. But i dont know her. I guess i just have to wait for the forth movie. I'm excited.  I watched the movie with my mom and dad, vj, kayla, and my friend AnnShelley.

      Man, if you were there you would really have a lot of fun. Today, we went to the carnaval, because it's Liberation Day. Okay i wouldn't spoil the story.  First, we went to Jollibee. Actually, we weren't planning to go there, only, we were too early in the carnival. We went there exactly 5:00 p.m., but the carnival started 6:00 p.m. So what we did was, we went to Jollibee to eat (of course), because it was the closest restaurant there, and we were so hungry. Actually, my dad just drinked beer, because he loves it.  Next, when the carnaval started, we rode the "SUPER TWISTER". It's a ride that turns around while it's turning around. But it was fun. Then Veejay and Makayla, (my brother and sister)rode the "CATTERPILLAR". Veejay hold Makayla, then sudenly she cried. We were expecting that because it was her first ride, (except the time when my mom,dad, and me rode the "OCTOPUS" in the Philippines, and my mom was pregnant with Makayla).  Finally, we rode the "OCTOPUS" (me, Veejay, And dad) here in Saipan. At first, me And Veejay was scared, because when we saw the operator turned on the "OCTOPUS", we thought that it was so scary. But dad asked us to ride it because we already had the tokens. So we agreed to him. We don't want to waste the money. Then when we rode the "OCTOPUS", we were really having a great time with the ride...

      Tonight was a wonderful night. It might not be night to some other places, but i know,if sunsets, it's a beautiful thing to watch. Actually, sunset is more dramatic to watch than any other drama movies. It's a one-of-a-kind experience. It's like, if sunsets, sun wouldn't rise anymore. Had you ever felt that?  I don't know, but if i'm talking about night, how did i end up talking about sunset and sunrise?  Whatever! All i know is i'm so happy if i watch the sunset... "All i know is i'm so happy when you're dancing there... I'm a slave for You!!!" (JOKE)

      Today is not really an exciting day. I just, uhm, watched T.V., took care of my little sis, and ate delicious food. I think that was fun. It's kinda immature, but we watched "scooby-doo". My lil' sis slept, then play again. I'm starting to realize that today was, well, fun. I thought wrong. Well, i'm not perfect you know.  But anyways, I'm happy to be with my siblings, and play to with them.  That's all...

      Sorry i forgot to "introduce myself".  I'm a teenage girl that you can call "LUVLUV". I know, i know, that's not really a name that's good for a teenage. That was my childhood nickname which i still find cute and childish. Well, that's me. I have to be true to myself, ya know, and because none of you know me!  I have a sister, and brothers.  You know, i'm a type of person that if i meet someone new, i'm like a statue that cannot move nor talk. I'm a shy person, but once you get to know me, i'm loud (well, that's what my mom said), sassy, and sometimes entertaining if you're sad. I'm like a clown to my friends, but i don't really talk much in our house because, i'm shy.  Well anyways, i don't really want to "expose" myself because i just don't want.  (IF YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR ME, JUST WRITE IN COMMENTS! BUT I'M NOT ASSURING YOU THAT I WILL ANSWER THEM ALL, BECAUSE I CAN'T USE THE INTERNET IN THE MORNING...)

      Oh, what a tiring day it is. Today, we went to my grandma's house because both of my parents were working. They have to really work hard because school is coming up and vacation's over (well, almost over...). Actually, we do still have 2 months left to cool off, but i don't think that's enough. For ten months we were at school, now only 2 months vacation? Anyone want to join me in a strike-something-whatever? Well, you can join me once i know how to strike-something-whatever. I don't really know a lot of stuff in life because i'm just a teenkid? Or something like a kid turning teen.  Well, i hope a lot of "teenkid" like me relates to what i'm saying right now, or some adult who went pass by my experiences right now understands me.  That was a very tiring day for me... Hope to get some comments from you....

      well, its really weird what happened today. there's this 11 year old boy, named Arturo, he was stalking me in the chatroom. i don't really know why. he's freaky. he said he lives in Washington, not D.C.. lol he kept on asking me what's my name, but i ignored him, anyways. that actually happened to me many times before. but now i have my friends. they are bob, daniel, zero, liss, kitty, virus, and lizzy, liss's sister. they always hang out in the same room everyday. i like talking to them. bob is 13, daniel is 15, zero is 16, liss is 14, kitty is 14, virus is 14, and lizzy is 12, just like me. well, that's awhat they told me. but i can't judge them. i can't tell if they are actually lying or telling the truth. what's really funny is all of them have the same time zones, except for me. if its like 10 pm here, its 8 am there. but they all sleep in the morning. and i don't. i sleep at night. so if they are sleeping in the morning, im sleeping too, because if it's morning there, its night here. so i can deal with it. all of them lives in states. well, im not. but i want to try schooling there for college.

      mtv i always watch mtv. and now i watched road rules, and they failed to complete their mission. and that mean they have to vote one of their team mates out. and if they vote someone out, the person that they vote out will go home without any prize, which is really sad because all of them are relly good friends. i saw the emotion in them. it was really sad. and i hate it. i wish all of them can just be together to complete the mission. there were six of them. kina, derrick, patrick, ibis, jodi, and danny. all five of them, voted out danny. and danny is gay. so now, danny is thinking that they voted him out because of his gender. and it hurts him. a lot. ..... oh well that's life! you gotta be a fighter.

      hello! its really nice to write on my blog again. our computer broke and we didnt have internet, so, i lost track of my blog again. and oh yeah, my sister's birthday is on wednesday, july 21.  she will be 1 year old, so everyone is really busy for the stuff that we need for her party. i don't even know what to give her, i don't even have money to start with. oh well, i can give her a lot of present not using money. i can use my creativity to write her a card. she couldn't even read it, but she can when she grows up. toys break fast, so a card will be perfect, like a souvenir from her first birthday from her older sis. that's cool. &nbsp; i really love ashlee simpsons' new sitcom, "the ashlee simpson show". she is so awesome, and she's not like her sister jessica. i think jessica is just, not immature, but kind of, a baby. and i think that's cool, because she's being the real her. she's not a fraud. she's herself. and her husband, nick lachey, they are like, the perfect couple for each other. but nick have to adjust for his wife jessica. they are just so sweet to each other. and that's s-w-e-e-t. &nbsp; okay that's all for now. my hands and fingers are tired. and my brain hurts. not litterally. goodnight! &nbsp;

      virus for two days our computer was infected by this "i have no idea what kind of virus is", and that's why i didn't have the chance to write on my blog. my dad said it's something that i have downloaded without knowing. DUH!. we've tried two virus protections but didn't work. so today he brought it to his work to fix, and now when he came home, well it was fixed. and i'm so happy. i was most feeling guilty because i was the one who stayed with this computer for a long time than my brother does. i may have no idea what this virus is called but i'm sure i'll be a lot careful than how i use to be.

      magicland i swear to whoever. "i will not ride the rock o plane anymore". it killed me. well, not really killed me, but it, i don't know, it changed me life. now i don't want to ride any of the carnival rides anymore. i don't want rock o plane, no more. like spider man2, "i want to have my own life, not spiderman, no more". L.O.L. my brother even said "it's like gonna make your stomach fly". and i said, "it's like gonna cut your body in half". and my dad said, "that's the purpose of the carnival. it make you feel like s..t".but i don't think i will have a wonderful July 4th. goodnight!

      well, i lost track of my blog because of the typhoon. we didn't have power for three days, i guess?! the first day of the typhoon, which i think was monday, we slept in P.I.C. it's a very well-known hotel. well, not to brag anything, but it was $100 bucks per day. we're not rich, so we only slept there for a day. i slept with my grandmom, dad, mom, and siblings. "it was a nasty storm", my dad said. "holy cow, man", my mom said. "why can't you just sleep in our house, it's expensive here. you people will be really broke", my grandmom said.   then the next day, we went home, hoping that we have power. but we were so absolutely, incredibly, wrong. we still didn't have power, so, we slept in a hotel called "bianca". nothing special, it was $40 dollars, though. i hoped we just slept to "stanford", another $40 dollars, but in my opinion, more better than bianca, no offense. but it was okay, they have channel 15, 16, 17, 18, & 19. those channels have great movies. but, we can't afford it in our house, because there's so much bills to pay every month. i watched "chicago" that night. i watched "pirates of the carribean: the curse of the black pearl", in the morning, after my mom and brother watched this, i don't know what's the title show.  i was still sleeping, because that night, when i was about to sleep, my brother filled the whole space that there was nothing left for me. coz, we slept in the same bed, which was so small. then after that, he kept on snoring. well, enough of that. then 12:00 pm we went back home hoping to have power, but again, we were wrong. our water was together with the power. good thing, we had a big tank for everyone in the whole apartment to share. but when we tried to get some more water, it was empty, finish, done. so my grandmom decided for the four of us to go sleep at her house, and so we did. i called my uncle marvin to pick us up. then when we got there, my dad told us that we have to sleep there because there's still no power. so we slept there. my mom asked my grandmom to lend them some, i mean a fan, electric fan, because my dad brought a generator not big enough for an aircon. then when we slept vj, of course, kicked me again. and that's when i draw the line. whenever he kicked me, i pushed his leg back.  then now, which is thursday, july 1, we had power and went back home tonight, coz our parents had works.  bu-bye,  dessa

      my first week in junior high was so cool. except running in p.e. well that's why there's p.e. to help us be physically fit. but today mr. harmsen told us to run like four laps, and it was like approximately a mile per lap. it was very hard. when he was explaining us what to do, i thought only go around in circle for less than 10 minutes. and i was like, very easy. then when he told us, four laps, i was like, holy mother gracious i cant i'll die. and then when i start, i was like one of the people that was in the front, then after a while i got very tired.  and after like 2 more laps it was very dark, like my eyesight got dark and i was dizzy, and my legs was numb i cant feel it. and i was like im not doing this again, next week. after 4 laps i couldnt catch my breath, i needed to open my mouth very wide just to gasp for air. holy, just so hard. and im guessing tomorrow morning i wouldnt be able to get up from my bed. well, its okay because there's no school tomorrow... YAY i dont have to walk for two days.

      well, today is my 4th day in junior high. there are ups and down, but really fun... the first day, well, we have met our homeroom teacher, Mr. Joe Connolly. He is such a very active person. He has one son, and a chinese wife, i think. He talks FRENCH, and everyday he talks, not really talk, but like tell us something in FRENCH, which is so cool. and on the first day, he taught us the rules and regulations of his class and the whole school. he taught us to RESPECT girls, no profanity words or language, and more rules that i forgot. and oh yeah, his class is about SPEECH. everyday he will write proverbs on the board not biblical proverbs, but like saying, and we have to write about the time that it was a fact to us. like `all's well that ends well'. then my second period class is Mr. Douglas, he teach us LANGUAGE ARTS. He is not that much. He ask us if we can follow his rules and we're like YES, so no problem. then my third period is Mr. Harmsen, my PHYSICAL EDUCATION teacher. oh gosh... i remember yesterday in p.e. class, we did curl ups, push ups. but i actually did 16 curl ups in a minute. i would have had more if my classmate ELDRID, didn't fart. it was disgusting. and well, i did laugh and i lost focus. that was stupid. and so unfair. i must have did like, 30 or something if it wasn't for eldrid. moving on people.... my 4th period is Ms. Black, our Life Skills teacher. She's not very mean, but my first impression was that. Seriously, i thought she was black american, but she's not. i guess its just her last name. now my 5th period teacher is Mr. Wertz, my SCIENCE teacher. He is a very big fan of Directions. He wants you to follow directions, or else. my 6th period teacher is Mr. Douglas, again. then my 7th period is Ms. Manahane, social studies teacher. not much... and 8th period teacher, Ms. Torres, Math teacher.
