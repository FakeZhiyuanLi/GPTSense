                  A horse is a horse, of course, of course,  And no one can talk to a horse of course  That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mister Ed.    Go right to the source and ask the horse  He’ll give you the answer that you’ll endorse.  He’s always on a steady course.  Talk to Mister Ed.    People yakkity yak a streak and waste your time of day  But Mr. Ed will never speak unless he has something to say    A horse is a horse, of course, of course,  And this one’ll talk ‘til his voice is hoarse.  You never heard of a talking horse?    Well listen to this: "I'm Mister Ed."

      Hi if you read my first post you probably realized that i have a pie club if you're interested in joining this club or attending one of these events read on..... The Pie Club was started by Earny Green in 1989. Since then he has sadly moved on to other things and gave the ownership to me. The Pie club meets every Sunday from 4-6 p.m. at wherehouse 50 on Peir 50 (it's near the baseball feild) We have many discussions and do other interesting things related to pie. If you would like to join it costs $7 and $3 for every month you are part of it. We also have special pie club events which are open to the public. These events are $5 for non-members and free for members. Here are some of the events and their dates. July 18th Pie History Day( a presentation will be made on the history of pie) July 25th-Pie Eating Contest August 20th-Pie themed birthday party for our special friend maggie August 27th-Learn how to make 5 different kinds of pies Note anyone planning to join or attend any of these events must contact me before hand -Maxine

      See, I ate food today and it was quite good. sooooooo...... this is fun........I like pressing the button that putts dots on the screen...... I think I spelled my title wrong oh well, isn't this interesting? I went to Europe for those of u hoo didn't know!!!!!!Hey, its Ariana here to spuce things up because Maxine doesnt know what to say!!!!!!Well okay back to Maxine.... I hope that little commentary inspired you to spruce up boreing stuff.(oops spelled it wrong, oh well) If you like pies u can join my pie club its quite fun, we eat pies not that that has anything to do with pies or anything. okay ariana has somthing to say-Okay Maxine I say SCREW YOUR PIE CLUB!!!!!!!!!!but that wasnt very nice.....what is a pie club anyway. Before we can say that it is bad we need to understand it more deeply. Nuclear wars are started by the word "hate" so I suggest you never say that you HATE Maxine's pie club OR ELSE (there will be a nuclear war)!!!!- back to maxine- I hope you enjoyed arianas "speach" about maxine's non-existent pie club
