      Hura was born on a cloudless night. It was so very calm that one could hear the leaves outside. Inside that small hut a midwife was trying to deliver the child. Inishia was in a lots of pain and was cursing everyone she knew. Outside the hut Hakulla was pacing up and down with a couple of vilagers. He knew that bad was going to happen. Finally the midwife came out running and said something in Hakulla's ear, he had lost Inishia. Hura came to the world and was branded as a devil -- thee devil who killed his mother and started growing up like one.  There was not a single day when Hakulla wonk beat him up. When Hura was 6 years old he learnt that in order to survive the world he has to cut throats. His world at that time was his family of a ever drunk father and 10 other brothers and sister. Hura learned his surviving skill very early and proved his skills at the age of 10 when he sold his eldest sister for 20 dollers. It was a big sum of money those days.  Growing up wasnt easy but he did very well. By the time he was 19 he had 19 brutal murders and a couple of espionage under his name and had gathered enough money to escape to Russia.  I met Hura on one of my missions, i had to hire and train one *out-of-the-agency* and *expendable* agents and he seemed to be best suited for the job. He had a passion inside him -- a passion to find things out and kill!! He had those clear eyes and there was one thing very clear in those eyes -- he meant business -- he was the best natural killer that i ever met.

      Friday, 21 May, 11:45 PM Karachi,Pakistan  I tried her number in vain a couple of times. I got so sick of her answering machine that i poured myself a very large vodka, sitting and dragging on to my cigeratte i was thinking about the day that went so well. The Mole field is very big. It is a very planned and organized operation and i have my doubts that it is not one organization that is running it. It has to be a combined effort of KGB, CIA may be ISI too. The roots go very deep and are very well hidden. It is not going to be as easy as i thought. I was shaken from my deep thought by the constant ring of the phone. It must have been ringing for some time now.  "Who is it" i barked. There was a silence on the other side, i could hear the person lighting a cigerrate. "So you are the one.. huh?" He said in a heavy hungarian accent. "Listen to me very carefully coz i wont repeat. That girl is going to die a very slow death. Tell her to stop nosying around my business" The click on the other side was heavy. It was a Beretta 105, after 12 years of field job i knew the weapon by its sound. "Who is this? What girl?" I said.  The phone went dead. The first thought that came to my mind was that it was some drunk who was playing midnight pranks, but there was a certainity about his voice. Then it hit me i have to reach to Tequila. I dialed her number again but was greeted by the same machine "I am out leave me your number and i shall call". I had to do something.. i cannot let her go waste like this.  Tring!!  The doorbell. God they still have those old fashioned bell in Pakistan. Ha!! I collected my Beretta and opened the door it was her looking exactly the way she looks. Time never seem to have any effect on her. She was wearing a pink evening gown. Gosh she looks so good in Pink, she always has. She pushed me inside with the same primitive laugh and said gear up it is going to be one long night.

      Friday, 21 May, 4:45 PM Pakistan  Here i am standing, in the worst downpour of my life, waiting for my contact to deliver the package. This mission is a Mole Hunt. I was tipped by my contact in KGB about a potential and widely spread mole activity happenning right inside the CIA. We have lost men - good men. The director briefed me about the gravity of this mission. I have to be very careful.  Deja Vu!! There goes the same Red Ambassador  again (Why red!! Ha!!)  This cannot be a coincidence!! "When you are in the field remember one thing there are no coincidences. A coincidence means that your position is compromised" said the director during one of the training sessions.  Suddenly the Red Ambassador passed me again and stopped a little ahead of me. I was already ready with my Beretta 66. Ready to confront whatever steps out.  It was Tequila suddenly i started feeling the same "Weak-knees" syndrome. So she was a KGB afterall. I havent been wrong. She approached me, she was wearing the most alluring smile (ofcourse apart from that shear Red Gown!! Ha!!) She came very close to me, i could smell her cigerrate. So she hasnt changed. "Can you smell the rats?" she said in a whisper. "The rats are all over" i said. The packets changed hands and she turned away and walked towards the Car.  I wanted to stop her, ask her where she had been all these years. She turned and threw something towards me. I ducked. She let out a primitive laugh. "If i wanted to kill you then i would have done that long time back" she said. She was gone.  Bingo!! i have her number now.

      Friday, 21 May, 3:45 PM Pakistan  Here i am on yet another mission. Outwardly this mission is no different than any of the earlier ones. This life has always facinated me but it has  its drawbacks too. I never understood what Tequila wanted, i always thought she was a KGB operative. Ha!!  Looking back i realise that she was actually as innocent as Hura (thats another story - shall write about it in detail someday) now i wonder that all the time while i was thinking that she is looking for my gun, trying to disarm me, what was on her mind?  She was actually looking for thee Gun. She was actually trying hard to disarm me.. Ha!! But that was a different time - a different era.

      Sorry guys i hadnt posted for some time. I have been running places to get *something* done. It is a "classified P4453$R" project so cant tell you a  lot about it. All i can tell you is that there are some agents that need to be straightened up. I know you will be worried about a lots of things (the extermination of the entire human race for example) but dont worry "Mai hu na" * "Mai Hu na" is a hindi phrase that means "i will be there"

      Friday, 13 January, Munich  Waiting for Tequila. Don't know whether my contact in  Korea has passed on the correct information to me. These damned CIA guys messed up Langley too. Waited for long...no sign. I have already called Tequila through the scrambler phone in Zurich to get past the taps by KGB. See a tall girl furtively making her way towards me. The British intelligence was right. She had big boobs...I hope she is not hiding a transmitter in them. She whispered, " The evening feels great". I whispered back, "My underwear feels brown". You have to whisper when your underwear is brown. Those years as a mole at ISI were not in vain. Contact established. We made our way past the thick crowds in the even thicker darkness towards a coffee rendezvous.  Saturday, 14 January, Vienna  Could not write more last night as I think I was being followed. Tequila quickly briefed me on my assignment. I was to make sure I charmed her. This looked difficult. The last time I charmed a person, she turned out to be a “he”. Tequila gave me the inside information on the BAR (must find out what it stands for). The BAR was fabulously organised. Wasn't sure how I was going to get past. Her sources were impeccable said she as she quickly tried to pass me some files under the table. I think she was just testing me. It was just her foot making its way up on my thigh. Think she was looking for my Beretta Magnum 33. Luckily, I have kept it in a place where she will not find it. Ha! Even I cannot find it. I have been looking for it for almost 3 months now. Tequila said that she was in the loop for 6 months but her cover as a waitress won't fool me.  I had a coffee ...black...just like my future seemed to me given the task at hand at breaking in BAR. Damn, I should have got my Mauser along. The BAR had a front. It turned out to be some place where they serve drinks. (Still don’t know what BAR stands for). There were 2 very muscular men at the front. Things did not look good. Tequila just smiled at them and unbuttoned the top of her low cut blouse and walked past the bouncers swaying her hips. I too did exactly the same. Must do that to blend in. Don't want to attract too much attention.  Sunday, 15 January, London  Sorry ….I had to leave the adventure halfway yesterday too. I suspected some bugs. So where was I, yeah Tequila went to the bar table and ordered a Screwdriver. She said she liked long hard things and winked. I think she knows about my rifle, the Telescopic Gewehr 45. Damn, she was good. Things don't look good. The dance floor was alight with people. She took my hand and led me to the dance floor. I checked the ceiling strobes, it was difficult as Tequila was trying to French kiss me so I had to dance with my back towards her. Ha, I am good too. The strobes looked good…no cameras.  Suddenly Tequila slid close to me and asked me whether I wanted to go to some place alone. Ha!!! She was obviously thinking of disarming me with unarmed combat. I slid back. I was pretty sure that the KGB had tipped her off. It was time to make my move. I pretended to take a call on my hand phone and told her I had to leave. She said she would call me. Nice girl, I look forward to our next date.  Thursday, 19 June, Paris  Tequila never called. I wonder why.

      There's a hole in the world tonight There's a cloud of fear and sorrow There's a hole in the world tonight Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow  They say that anger is just love disappointed They say that love is just a state of mind. But all this fighting over who is anointed, Oh, how can people be so blind?  Oh, they tell me there's a place over yonder Cool water running through the burning sand Until we learn to love one another,  We will never reach the Promised Land  There's a hole in the world tonight,  There's a cloud of fear and sorrow There's a hole in the world tonight Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

      Dont know what to write today!!!  Ever tried to hold on to something only to realize that it is slipping away from your hands??? They say the more you hold on to something the more difficult it will be to actually keep it in your hands. It is like holding sand in your hands.. if you keep your grip tight then the sand will seep out of your hand. Keep it loose and it will stay in your hand. But human mind looks for control!! We try to hold on to our loved ones close and tight. Should we let them go?  Something inside me told me that i should let her and her thoughts go away.. and this thought made me so sick. I thought that i can never let her go. But then all of a sudden it was so simple. I just have to kill something inside me.. this slaugher needs to be slow. It will resist but it will eventually die. So let it be (dead).

      The first time i saw her i thought she is preety, but so are almost all the girls around the globe. We didnt talk to each other for a long time, i was afraid that i will start liking her and a romantic relationship is the last thing i would want to do at office. But i always admired her, she was beautiful, simple, elegant. She is the most soft-spoken girl that i have ever seen and has those big eyes that poets talk about.  And then i thought what is the harm in having a simple friendship, i was decieving myself. Things were great those days, we used to chat so much, we used to meet up for coffee and would just chat and chat. It was like a dream - a beautiful one. Somewhere in the middle of those innocent chats she make her way into my mind. And then soemthing happened, something that has never happened to me before, something that was totally alien to me. I would think about her all the time just remembering what she said, how she looked at me, how she laughed. I would run to my cell phone as soon as it beeps thinking that probably its her and for the first time in my life i felt what it was to be in love.  The more i thought about her the more i realized that she is *thee one* for me.  I started giving her subtle hints about how i feel and was on top of the world when she didnt tried to stop me or push me away.   Ok so you read it till here.. $ 100 to the person who suggest an ending to this love story :)  Please leave your names in the comments so that i can add a note of acknowledgement.  Happy thinking!! :)

      Someone asked me define pain? Pain!!! Imagine this... it is Friday 4:35 PM and you are sitting in ur cubicle and trying hard to pretend that you are a busy man... trying hard to keep those eyelids open.  Imagine that she is not talking to you.. actually she is clearly avoiding you coz you again said something (she doesnt want to hear) and she is lamely pretending that she didnt understood. Imagine that you have checked you mails zillion times with the hope to see a new mail.. but looks like it is a dead world.   Do i need to say more?

      What now!!! This is one BIG question that haunts me since the day i joined HCLT. There is just not enough work to do. Well there is a lots actually but who wants to write word docs on how to do quality work and implement CMM practices when actually no REAL (!!) work is being done. Just did what i love doing at office. Lunch time with her is something i look forward to everyday. But now she is back to her seat and talking on Realpop is not that attractive.  Anyways captain is on the deck so lets start pretending that i am very very busy :D Cya later folks i have docs to fight.
