       Ok this is to ALL my video game friends......there are a lot of sites that have free, yes FREE games.    Newgrounds.com is a good one for flash games, but its definently made for the older croud, so if u go there dont do it with the rents around!!!!    Then there's ebaumsworld.com which is the same as newgrounds, but has more variety, but the same deal here..    The best place to go for clean games is addictinggames.com!!!!! tons of games and all of them are clean...i think    there are a couple other places but im tired of typin this so have fun!!!
