      Tonight was a good night Mario.  Do you see what you are losing.  We went out to dinner.  It was very nice.  Pizza and cheese sticks.  Talking and laughing.  The kids and I got you your graduation present.  A watch.  It looks very good on you.  I'm here alone.  Marissa and Brittany are at the pool.  You and Mario have gone to Walmart for you to get a few last minute things.  *sigh*

      Dear Mario,   We have two days left living together as husband and wife. You will be leaving on the 14th to start your new life in Los Angeles, less a wife and two children. We went today and got you your portion of the house money.  I know you think that I am screwing you, but I think that I am being more than fair with what you got.    I've kept my mouth shut about your graduation and you going to party with your four girlfriends from school after the graduation ceremony. I don't even want to go to the graduation now. I've worked so hard trying to make things up to you for my affairs. For destroying our marriage. I wanted you to get through school. I'm so proud of you. You have essentially slapped me in the face, by not allowing your family that has suffered so much so that you could get through school, share this moment with you.   There is so much that I want to say to you.  I still love you, not as a wife, but someone that has cared for you, suffered for you and been there when you needed me, helped you become a citizen, helped your family and because you have given me the most wonderful gift of all, our children.  We had 17 pretty good years together.  My affairs are not the only reason for our marriage breaking up.  I was so very angry with you when you came back to go to school, but refused to get a job to help out during the summer or even through a temp agency when you had spring and winter break.  Instead you allowed me to work seven days a week at my 40 hour job and the furniture company.  I missed so much because of that, but I need to keep our heads above water.  It was a struggle.  When I was laid off from the second job we started the paper-route.  The extra $500 that it brought in a month was very helpful.  I was so stupid thinking things would work out.  I should never have allowed you back in our lives two years ago.  NEVER.  You didn’t come back for me or the kids.  You came back to complete your education as all costs.  It cost you all right, it has now cost you your kids.  I know they are going to be with you for three weeks, but I also suspect you will be calling me to come and get them.    You have not been the best of fathers.  I’ve made excuses for you.  Oh, he works swing, he hasn’t been around when the kids were growing up so he hasn’t been able to see be a father to them.  Do you remember that I would get up every Saturday morning and take the kids out of the house until noon or later so that you could sleep.  They only saw you on Saturday afternoons, Sunday and Monday nights.  I always told them to be on their best behavior.  It didn’t do any good though.  Their behavior is never up to what you believe it should be.    Now, you tease them both unmercifully until they are in tears.  Even when they tell you to stop and get mad and yell at you, you still do it.  Then you turn around and say they don’t love you and that you are not a part of the family.  That I isolate them from you.  This is not true.  Stop means stop, but you don’t stop, you continue on.  Calling Mario stupid and lazy is not good. A parents job is to nurture their child not ridicule them.  That is what you do.   I know that you love them both, but it still hurts them.  You have always done this, like starting an agrument so that you do not feel guilty about what you are doing.  You justify it.  The other day when Marissa was crying and told you she didn’t want you to leave, when she was out of earshot, you said to me, “I hope you feel guilty every time she cries for her daddy.”  You know what?  I don’t feel one bit of guilt.  You are the one moving 1000 miles from them.  You are the one that has decided to do this.  You are the one that does not want to be here.  You are leaving me, not your children, but you are leaving them, aren’t you?     So, you are shirking your responsibility and moving away.  I know that you do not have a job.  I know that I probably will never see a cent of child support.  You are checking out of my life, I pray that you don’t check out of theirs.  You are going to miss so much because of your selfishness.  Marissa’s first date, prom, graduation.  Mario’s football career.  You will go down there and your girlfriend will join you.  Yes, I know that you have a girlfriend.  Marissa saw you online with her.  Telling her you love her.  She probably has her visa all ready.    So Mario, you are the one that is being selfish.  Leave me, but don’t leave your kids.  Face up to the reality that you had some responsibility to the demise of our marriage as well.  I’m sorry you have turned into a self-centered, selfish, vindictive man.  Maybe the kids are better off with you gone.
