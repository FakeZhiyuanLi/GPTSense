        Matchmaker, matchmaker ... As promised, I have a Jessica Cutler themed posting. The reason for my delay in uploading it, though -- and, please, remember: NPI -- is, my thoughts on the matter were a bit garbled, knotted, and self-contradicting. 

 See, many of those whom I admire, including Hunter S. Thompson, Axl Rose, and Allan Iverson, have been guilty of worse than whatever Ms. Cutler might have done. Moreso, I revel in the exploits of the initial three. For Ms. Cutler, though, I reserved... It was not "nothing but scorn", though close. 

 At this moment, though, I have an explanation for why, in the case of Hunter Thompson indulging in an ether binge at Circus Circus, Axl Rose hurling long-necks at a concert-crowd in St. Louis, and A.I. bemoaning the need for giving one-hundred percent in not just games (where he does give 100%),  but practice , I do not question the foresight and integrity of the perpetrators, while, in the case of Ms Cutler "giving [sic] anal to a married Bush appointee", for $400 per performance, I do. 

 Simply, in the roles that the first three have chosen either to play or design, an outlaw character and wide rebellious streak is not just preferred, but expected. Those lend the colour to the entertainments in which Msrs Thompson, Rose, and Iverson involve themselves; so, they draw the spectators in, and hold them 'til the denoument of the performance. A former Nickelodeon intern and present Senator staff does not. She neither has the audience nor the title to be Capitol jester. 

 Rather, Ms Cutler is (was) a pencil-pushing call-screener, though certainly flitting in a better resume plum than I am in my own, non-blogging life, but nonetheless: she was a gleek. A  horny  gleek, yes, but I knew plenty of those in high-school: we called them the jazz-band, and/or theatre-club. Bookish, "big-tittied" (though often, but not always, from being generally fat), pleasant enough floes that would allow anything to hit them for fear of not, eventually, having anything willing to hit them. (Terminal acne suffering, teenage, male tuba-players and math-team stars, I am looking at you... I know you liked hitting that sh*t, their names being [completion deleted].) They JUST HAD TO get while the getting was going to be good for... quite... possibly... the... only... time... in... their... life. 

 And, so, Ms Cutler. Though, in her case, since she is a decade advanced in age from those of the high-school back-benchers I knew, she was getting with a slightly more affluent nerd class, and as well one with a bit more people, and more important people, from whom they would need to secret the lunch-time shagging and hundreds-dollars anal. So, where the sixteen-years-old second-chair oboist at [high-school deleted] carrying about forty pounds too many and an overbite beside, only has herpes simplex b to show for her dalliance, young Jessica of Syracuse/D.C./Random House/Playboy has that, and probably gonorrhea, and certainly a few thousand dollars to show. Huzzah! 

 Also, Ms Cutler's reputation as a prim lady is ruined. Sure, people still talk about her, plenty -- say, I, here --, and she will be seen about in polite circles in D.C. and NY (why, describing the then-governor's willy with such grotesquerie back in '95 earned Paula Jones a correspondents' dinner invite), but she will be not an equal partner in the conversation, and, instead, a cautionary tale not unlike the infamous  Signal 30  film-strip of drivers' education classes gone-by. 

 With this in mind, I propose, we, as a nation, set Jessica Cutler up on a date with someone with whom she can settle down, now that she has gotten (most of) her sodomite desire out her system, while still being about to be living comfortably. Therefore: let's schedule a dinner-and-movie for Ms Cutler and one Stephen Glass. I am sure they would hit it off. She, in the process of outlining her semi-fictionalized account and defense of indiscreet Beltway coitus amongst inconsequential personages with a less than ethical background, could ideate with Msr Glass, author of  Shattered... , the semi-fictionalized account and defense of one journalist's patent front-of-book deception, and following that, a bit down the road, go off with their shared publishers' advances and sales' proceeds and continue thinking themselves so superior, while we're inferior, while living in a "quaint" seaside colonial off Hatteras. 

 I am sure that is what each, Ms Cutler and Msr Glass, had in mind anyway. Maybe not exactly... But, come to think of it.... I mean, they did each doubtless want to play us, and play us they did; maybe even like a pimp. Who knows, then? Perchance five or six years from now, when Ice-T leaves  Special Victims Unit , the two District charlatan could replace him. Fitting that as well.

        Unreliable sources ... Harrumph. Mr Nader has presented his choice for Kerry's running-mate -- unprecedented really, since rare is it that an opponent for office can determine what someone will do as regards such an integral decision, let alone influence it, by direct (or even indirect, or "subjunctive") command (Who knows, though. Maybe Nader, as well as being the flush-master for reliability examination of each 10000 Flushes (TM) disc, is a hypnotist. Quick, somebody get Flansburgh and Linnell on the case!) -- and, lo, I cannot agree. Not in the slightest. 

 To begin, though, I have to admit something. I am not so cool to an Edwards pick as a Gephardt pick, as the North Carolinian's boni fidi verdi (don't worry: I never took Latin, so the phrasing is a guess, and probably a poor one... I am not really that stupid, as the case might appear, in dead languages; more likely, jus' ig'nant) are not so strong, and his reticence toward Clintoniana not pronounced at all. Or even extant. But, there is the matter of Edwards a Senator, and a Senator-Senator match, save for Kerry-McCain (or, as the ever erudite Nobrain O'Donnell witticized on Chris Matthews Weekend, "McCain-Kerry"), would be a death-knell. To pair two (Democrats) from the upper chamber would crystallize every impression that the Bush team wants to propose: the Democrats are aloof, ivory-tower elites, and the resulting tin-ear to popular -- read: blue-collar -- read: Reagan Democrat -- opinion of a Kerry-Heinz-Edwards administration would produce an effete America not suited to the post-11 September reality, and war on terror. 

 So, Edwards,  still , right out. 

 As to Gephardt: Kerry's selection of the Missourian populist-opportunist would strike me, in fact the thought of it strikes me, as a reprise of Dole's pick of Kemp. A bland, war-veteran, opposition nominee chose a shiny, supposed down-with-the-base party functionary, hoping to capitalize on that running-mate's contemporary right-wing stridency to prevent any peel from the essential voters to the rank of the stay-at-home, and maybe get some Reagan Dems. and otherwise, given Kemp's history as a pro footballer, beside. So too, I suppose Dole might have. He won forty-two percent, as memory serves, which would have been five percent greater than G. H. W. Bush pulled in '92. (Oh, damn you, Ross!...  Snicker. ) Even so, that still put the Dole one down on the Bill's pull in '92; as well, Clinton's '96 percentage rose five, to forty-eight. Thus, while Kemp preserved the tally of party regulars from four years before, he did not pull anymore "swingers" than could have been expected. (Perot's tally fell ten-percent, but that difference split down the middle, half to Dole, half to Clinton.... This fact also rains water on the truth of the ubiquitous fender-adhesive: Don't Blame Me -- I Voted for Bush.) 

 Gephardt would bring much the same buzzards' luck to Kerry. Sure, but a few Gore voters would jump to Bush, or Nader, but so too would few "swingers" swoop to Kerry. And on a state-by-state basis, if such as was the 2000 roll remained, Kerry would still finish second enough that Bush would take the electoral college. And this time, in pretty much what could only be called a walk. (As I recall from updated "Bush Country" maps I have seen, Bush winning the same states nets 293 electors to 245 for Kerry.) 

 Of course, Kerry would draw, even for the loss, and the lesser electoral votes than the inept Gore campaign, as well maybe one percent more of the national popular vote. Oh, what a night! Fifty-point-two percent!!... And Gore only took forty-nine-point-two percent! Wooooo!!! 

 Gephardt, then? No. Nononononononononononononono.... I would rather the  urlLink "Chin"  pick Ferraro. Or, why not?  Mondale.  Would serve just as well. 

 P.S. The other thing: Nader says he would be right pleased if Kerry took Gephardt or Edwards to the November Sweethearts' Dance. Presumably, then, this also implies: I, meaning Nader, might go easier on you on the trail, encouraging fewer, say, wine-and-whine-and-cheese Dems., to mark their ballots for me. But, what is Nader's word? The word that went, I won't campaign in swing-states, or the one that campaigned rigourously in Tennessee in the week before the election and that took one hundred thousand votes in Florida? I go with the latter. Remember also: Nader is a lawyer, and is a snake for that. Don't, don't, don't believe the Corvair-hater's hype, then.

        I make a funny ... I will have more to say, though maybe I shouldn't since probably it is mere distraction, about Ms Cutler and the Six "Johns", but for now, I leave it at a quip. 

 The reason for the one-time staff-ass' many-sided coitalism was that she interned in Sen. Lieberman's office before joing DeWine's staff as a salaried employee, and, eh, once you capture Joementum, there is no way to break it. The laws of thermodynamics do not work on it. You just keep going, going, going. And, as it relates to Ms Cutler's sex life, where pre-Lieberman internship she just might have been in a sexual relationship with ONE boyfriend and, mayhaps, engaged in rare, but awesome, one-night-standing, post-Lieberman internship, she needed six boyfriends just to feed the monkey at a clip even with its metabolic rate. So, I blame all this on Joe.

        He shows his  face, and it is good. Zinni appeared on  Sixty Minutes  this evening, and shined. He documented his distaste for the sitting administration's Iraq policy. As well, he detailed how we should go about an exit. Not with a dramatic, right-out withdraw, leaving Iraq to the Iraqis, but with an eye -- several, really -- to addressing the matter as the world did Bosnia and Kosova, but did not Rwanda. (We learned, I hope, from that last (lack of) exercise.) It is incumbent that we internationalized this effort, and with that, get more boots, many more boots, on the ground. (By my own estimation, a nice target would be similar the five hundred thousand we had in Saudi Arabia in '90-'91 in preparation for a POTENTIAL Iraq invasion.) 

 Of course, what we cannot do is assume the Kucinichian position: walking away. Though this would be nice, and would assure no further U.S. casualties and death, plus no Iraqi deaths at our hand or responsibility (though dubious as it is that the ONLY natural impulse for anybody, terrorist or not, whose family member has died by us is to kill us is all that second rests on), what I think we must recall is our own experience in Afghanistan I, and Vietnam, and, to a lesser extent, Korea. We left each of those battles unfinished, and/or with our hearts beaten down and our minds warped. So, too, at least in the first and third, we allowed an insurgence to fester. From those, we have fifty years of separation on the Peninsula, the most mined area in the world, and strained relations with China and Japan (see  initiative, strategic defense ), and a ruined manse between Iran and Pakistan taken over by a billionaire and his private club (mission statement: Death to the Western Infidel -- but please, allow my daughter admission at university in London; she will not get anything like that here... Sha'ria, y'know?) who scored their largest coup yet with the 11 September attack. 

 We can only hope we should imagine what could come, then, of a failed state with overflowing petro-wealth, abundant water, a well-trained professional class (perchance the only good product of Saddam's rule), and proximity to Iran and Israel, with an openness toward the latter that is  alarming . 

 The time to run is not nigh, nor should it ever arise. Instead, we must change course, but in, not out. We must entrench ourselves, as part of a multinational  security  force, in the infrastructure, and do likewise within the committee-rooms. But in the latter, not to abet the installation of a puppet regime a la the Platt policy of the first half of the past century as regarded a lush preserve where presently we detain Talib, but to offer lessons in transparency and efficiency (each not being a strong-suit of Stalinism, and the former not a strong-suit of the current overseers of what should be the operation). 

 So it is we need Bush, and moreso Cheney, Wolfowitz, Feith, out. Plus, Perle, Woolsey, and Ahmed Halabi (the C is silent, anyway; plainly, same as Chanukkah). Out with thee!

        Antiwar General , but don't call him generally antiwar. Oh, a little Safiric "word-power" humour to tide you over for my lack of posting. 

 So, I found this nugget on  urlLink Mr Drum 's once-but-not-future Calpundit. (KD got a blogger's promotion, from his own site to the  Washington Monthly . His mama must be proud. Doubly, in fact, since usually blogging is the path of the damned. Just look at Easterb*tch. Dumped from high-profile column -- really, it could be viewed as a once-weekly weblog -- gig at ESPN for remarks made at a second blog, and could only be redeemed by running to the trepidatious arms of the establishment (NFL.com, about whose product Easterb*tch writes; no conflict there, brah). Way to go  urlLink Donnie ,... I mean, oh, so tastefully named  urlLink Gregg .) 

 But I blather parenthetic enough. Here, from  Sixty Minutes , it appears, to Prof. Drum, to lowly ol' me: 

  General Anthony Zinni, 1997-2000: He believes the neocons, including Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith, the undersecretary of defense, have hijacked U.S. foreign policy: "In the lead-up to the Iraq war and its later conduct, I saw, at minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility; at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption."  

 How 'bout dem apples, Naderians? No difference between Bush, and Gore, and Kerry? Think a new Dunkey administration would keep on, say, a Feith, and maybe even elevate within the Pentagon?... 

 Didn't think so, b*tches.

        Will the real number two  please stand up... please stand up... please stand up?  
 Some days have passed since my blogger's devirginizing. But, I did not take this extended leave to ruminate on what I had planned already as my second post. That is, I know the only two names that should be  seriously  considered as Kerry's v.p. nom.  
 These are the nominees to be nominee: 
  General Anthony M. Zinni (USMC, RET.).  Thirty-years officer in Marine Corps, from Vietnam to opening of post-Cold War period. Later, special envoy to the Middle East Peace Negotiations, the years following from the Oslo Accord, and under both Clinton, and Bush II. Then, let go by Bush for expressing displeasure at build-up to Iraq war, and its adverse impact on the Israel-Palestinian resolution. 
 So, what has Zinni going? Military credentials, and Marine at that (though Rove may be able to spin Kerry's  NAVY  experience as the premier example of the Senator's pussiness, he won't be able to tar thus Zinni; you can't impugn a leatherneck so easily); expertise in the Middle East, inclusive a desire for moderation and resolution by other means than war; executive branch experience; from Pennsylvania, originally at least, with PA a swing-state. Further, he is ethnic. And, though I don't mean that as a slur, for the entire history of our country such has been a slur, and in our presidency-vice presidency we have always had Anglo-Saxons (save for van Buren, each Roosevelt, and Eisenhower, with the first three being Dutch stock from New York, which would not exactly have put them in the same position as Poles in Cleveland, Ukrainians in Pittsburgh, and (even) Italians in Boston, and Eisenhower -- damn if he wasn't a war hero, which trumps a lot (just look at Grant)), and by my unestimable estimation, before we can ever have a black or Latino or Asian president/v.p., we will need a stepping-stone from the lilly face of England to the the sepia-tone of our ever-expanding immigrant and urban community. We came close... er, not close, but at least he was on a major-party general election ticket, with Dukakis -- Greek, and Orthodox, even more "obscure/obscurantist" than an Italian Catholic --, and sixteen years later, we can push it over the top. 
 That said, and I acknowledge its potential to be viewed as racialism (then again, I don't have quite so great a way with words in the "real time" of blogheria), if only Harold Ford, Jr., were six months older than he is. A Blue-dog,  Southern  Democrat, with good looks and political pedigree (elected to father's former seat), and African-American. Would be as good for Democrats in '04 as McCain could have been for Republicans in '00... That is, Ford would be the dream candidate, playing the Sun Belt maverick to Kerry's establishmentarian New Englander. 
  Jeanette Napolitano.  Governor of Arizona since '03, and state attorney-general for a four-years term immediate before that. Also, appointed by Clinton as federal prosecutor, serving from '94-'99. From those, has executive experience -- something Kerry does not (Lt. Gov. for a two-years' span is not sufficient) --, and, almost more importantly courtroom experience (should play well to potential Democratic tack in war on terror, with the battle fought 90% in the courtroom instead of the battlefield, just like the war on drugs (we could make bin Laden the new Noriega)).
As well, native New Yorker -- golly, another ethnic, like Zinni -- who moved to southwest (New Mexico) with family and studied university there. So, has a certain regional appeal, the same as Richardson, but without the baggage of being at the helm during an embarrassing breakdown in Energy Dept. protocol. (Of course, it was not Richardson's watch under which the security breaches occurred; in fact, he was brought in from UN Ambassadorship to clean-up and care-take Energy.) The Southwest could be for twenty-first century Dems. what the Southeast was for Goldwater-Nixon-Reagan: an as-yet-untapped resource of copious electoral votes, with environmentalism, a fair notion, as the pull, and not racial purity, an unfair one, as was the case with the Southern Strategy. 
 So, the choice is Kerry's. Go Gephardt, or (even) Edwards, or Vilsack, and burn on re-entry like Mondale, or go (ever-so-slightly) unconventional and pull in enough new voters/non-voters/2000Greens -- Zinni, to be honest, would help with the last, even though he is career military, since he would add teeth to Kerry's Iraq exit strategy (where Kerry supported the war resolution, Zinni opposed) -- to take the election in, if not a walk, then solidly, at least. Maybe a margin same as '88, 54-46, or even 52-46-2 (if Nader can be on enough ballots, and get enough stoner collegians with trust funds to party-build for the Greens (though of course Nader's run is not Green this time)), y'know?

        Who should be number two? ... There exists no consensus, with even just a month prior to the announcement, as to whom Kerry's VP nod will go. But, from insider reports (from insiders who wish to remain anonymous ( typical )), Rep. Gephardt has received four in-person interviews, Gen. Clark and Sen. Edwards have had one each, and Bill Richardson has received no consideration at all (of course, being a convention chair ain' easy). 

 Now, allow us to examine why the four so-named are leading a rather dismal pack. With positives first: 

 Gephardt: from Missouri, a bellwether; twenty-six years of House service, including eight as Minority Leader. 

 Clark: four-star general, including one-time head of NATO command during its first, AND SUCCESSFUL, foray into combat (Bosnia '99); nominally a Southerner (though who in the army, navy, air-force... marines is not?); an elective-office outsider. 

 Edwards: Southerner; young,  and  cute; well-spoken; soft touch with the proverbial "Reagan Democrats". 

 Richardson: from the Southwest, and Latino; executive experience (Energy Sec'y, '97-'01; Gov. NM, '03-present); foreign-affairs experience (US Amb to UN, '93-'97). 

 And, negatives: 

 Gephardt: could not carry his backyard (Iowa), and you have to consider  it was his or Dean's 'til seventy-two hours before ; twenty-six years in the House, AND WHAT?; oversaw Democrat massacre at '02 polls. 

 Clark: "reputation" as a "Republican" (from where? but, no matter; it's a distraction); "questions" about his "conduct" as NATO High Commander, and namely toward Army OC subordinates. 

 Edwards: Southerner that cannot win his own state for Dems. in general election; legislative nubility (only one term, and done, in Senate); trial lawyer (a distraction,  not  substantial (character) flaw, but still...). 

 Richardson: led Clinton Energy Dept.,... following the Wen Ho Lee break, which means they brought him in to right the ship, and de-louse its decks, but the connection, however weak, to scandal is still there (but is the connection as weak the Iraq-Qaeda link?); not even under consideration by the Kerry campaign. 

 So, who is the presumptive leader, as the field "narrows"? 

 Considering that Gephardt lost Iowa -- in fact, took fifth, and thus forced himself from the race before the proverbial "start" of the primary season in New Hampshire --, and that Ohio (another bellwether) sits 49-42 for Kerry,  and that set includes a Naderian presence , I think Gephardt's chance is toast. The Kerry reps may have interviewed Gep four times, but no matter. 

 Similarly, Richardson is a non-factor. Not under consideration, busying himself planning the Boston DNCC. 

 These leave Clark and Edwards. Edwards has "fewer" "negatives", and is a bona fide Southerner (has lived in SC or NC his whole life; Clark was military, and so never got any real hold on a region he could call his own), so he has the edge. But, a Senator-Senator ticket has not come to pass since Kennedy-Johnson -- though, yes, another New England-Deep South combination platter --, and a Senator has not won the White House DIRECT FROM THE SENATE since Kennedy. 

 Thankfully, there will be other, BETTER choices, including some that meet two of my key credits (Southwestern or Western, or military). (Golly, I wonder who those could be?)
 MORE TO COME.

        I imagine he doesn't go  to  urlLink South of the Border , either... That said, racism has a new face in the CSA. Of course, not because  urlLink Robinson's  a self-loathing black, either -- oh, he probably isn't --, or some kind of  urlLink Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartment  Republican (that being a potential name for a  cafe sin leche  arm of the GOP, with similarity to the gaybos Log Cabin Republicanism). Instead, as the CSA has become more integrated, but no less insular -- the promise of the New South, and Georgia specifically, with its influx of Northern capitalists, is nil; the nouveau carpet-baggers have become indoctrinated in the culture of their new surrounding, while bringing little of their own to bear (as an example, NASCAR over open-wheel racing, what? I don't fancy either, at all, but I take the latter over the former, if I have to take either)--, the target has shifted. No longer is it a matter of caucasians dominating blacks; blacks are on a generally equal footing (as equal, say, as the much-touted, but probably misleading, data-point that female workers earn seventy-seven cents to male workers' every dollar). Today, it is a matter of colonial purity.... 

 Or, "If we cannot keep our children from miscegenating, at least have them only miscegenating with people whose gran'pappies' gran'pappies' gran'pappies were here when Betsy Ross sewed our standard, and George Washington was whupping some Jerry ass." 

  Yes.  

 Now, then: have a look-see at  urlLink this : 

   What does it mean to be a black Jesse Helms, in Robinson's view? Robinson's rhetoric is so poisonous it has made national headlines, the campaign site proudly admits. His latest anti-immigration ad says it all. Cue the theme to the Twilight Zone, and the announcer begins: "The aliens are here, but they didn't come in a spaceship. They've filled our criminal courtrooms and clogged our schools ... They sponge off the American taxpayer ... they've even taken over the DMV. These aliens commit heinous crimes ... You walk into a McDonald's restaurant to order a Big Mac, and find to your horror that the employees don't speak English." Twilight Zone, indeed.  

 The ad made headlines when a station pulled it over Memorial Day weekend because the required disclaimer at the end telling listeners who paid for the spot is in Spanish. Actually, it starts with "Yo, Gringo," then continues on in Espanol. A station manager explained that the ad was pulled because most listeners wouldn't understand who paid for it. (It has since been put back on the air with an English discaimer.) The "Yo Gringo" touch, the campaign explained, was intended to make the point that when people speak Spanish, lots of non-Spanish speakers don't understand them. "In so doing we make our case why English should be the official language of the United States," Robinson told a local paper.   

 Indeed: he rocks, this Vern. And to think, who is working the fields, oft-times, at his fair state's  urlLink fecund tobacco farms ? (Scroll to page seven, please.)  Imagino que gringos componen la mayoria del personal, pero... Piensa el que tambien hay muchos no documentados trabajando casi como esclavos en esas granjas?  

 Plus, as a Republican, his principal constituency is business. And those businessmen who hire illegals, and more than likely underpay them (i.e. pay them less, considerably less, than the native-son black and white workforce), make more money than those businessmen who hire strictly native-born applicants. And in turn, it is more money to potentially feed to Vern's campaign. So, illegals  really  benefit  him.  Huh? 

 Quit mixing messages then, baiting-and-switching, I say. He shovels the pablum of the  meztizo menace  oh, so earnestly to the blue-collar, still-maybe-but-probably-not mug-wump North Carolinian voters, but in Cohiba-scented, sealed rooms, he flirts shamelessly, a wink and an exchange of a cash-filled briefcase (oh, that Washingtonienne, i.e. whore, wannabe, he), with the executives who won't hire those same blue-collar, native North Carolinian plebes if they don't have to. 

 Yes..? 

 Also, and lastly, I present to my dear reader(s), as way of rejoinder, this: 

 "Frijolero", by  urlLink Molotov  

  Yo ya estoy hasta la madre de que me pongan sombrero 
 Escucha entonces cuando digo no me llames frijolero 
 Y aunque exista algun respeto y no metamos las narices 
 Nunca inflamos la moneda haciendo guerra a otros paises 
 Te pagamos con petroleo e intereses nuestra deuda  
 Mientras tanto no sabemos quien se queda con la feria 
 Aunque nos hagan la fama de que somos vendedores  
 De la drogra que sembramos ustedes son consumidores  

   CHORUS:  
  Don't call me gringo, you fuckin beaner 
 Stay on your side of that goddamn river 
 Don't call me gringo, you beaner 
 No me digas beaner, Mr Punetero 
 Te sacare un susto por racista y culero 
 No me llames beaner, pinche gringo punetero   

 Chingao.... 

  Now I wish I had a dime for every single time 
 I've gotten stared down for being in the wrong side of town 
 And a rich man I'd be if I had that kind of chips 
 Lately I wanna smack the mouths of these racists 
 Podras imaginarte desde afuera 
 Ser un mexicano cruzando la frontera. 
 Pensando en tu familia mientras que pasas, 
 Dejando todo lo que conoces atras. 
 Si tuvieras tu que esquivar las balas? 
 De unos cuantos gringos rancheros? 
 Les seguiras diciendo good for nothing wetbacks? 
 Si tuvieras tu que empezar de cero? 
 Now why don't you look down to  
 Where your feet is planted 
 That U.S. soil that makes you take shit for granted 
 If not for Santa Ana, just to let you know 
 That where you feet are planted would be Mexico 
 Correcto!  

  CHORUS 2x 

  
 .... That about says it, eh?

        I see that  Janet Napolitano has the second-headlining speaking slot on the second evening of the DNCC. So, while my hope proved entirely fruitless, and it appears my conjecture -- that we need either prosecutorial experience or military prowess to win, since this year, bad economy or good, gay weddings or torchings, the presidency will be won and lost on terrorism -- may show groundless, I was leading toward the vision of a Kerry administration. Certainly, I think Napolitano will (should) get consideration for attorney-general in a shadow cabinet for the campaign and/or the real thing come transition in November and December, into January '05. 

 As for Zinni, I am sure he could be up for Defense, or Central Intelligence, but now is not the time or place for that. We still have to give Cheney the ultimate fuck-you: a ticket back to Wyoming. Oh, whatever is there to do in Wyoming!? 

 But, my question is: where are the speaking slots for Gen. Clark, and Rep. Kucinich, and Rev. Sharpton?... I do know, of course, that Mr Lieberman's slot has been booked already for night three of the RNCC. (How 'bout him to replace Cheney?)
