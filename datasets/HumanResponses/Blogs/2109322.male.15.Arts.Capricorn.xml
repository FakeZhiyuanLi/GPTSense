      I'm having a good day. Started out at school, I didnt do horrible on the test, so I was happy. It was mostly mediocracy all day, but I had a good time in band, mostly because I might, MIGHT be able to play Bari Sax. That's enough hope for my day. But it was good anyway. After school I went to rehearsal, and since it was later, I just hung out there until it started with Kristin and everyone else. It was nice. Anyhow, then we did our difficult scene, but Doug was sick, so Aaron had to be Doug. I had a nice conversation with Mrs. Francis about computers. She's still doing Enrichment, you know. I miss enrichment... Anyhow, after that we did regular stuff, and then I went to the church and we had this craptacular halloween party. Ian acted like a goat. Then I came home. I had a good time walking home with Kristin, we made jokes and talked about the bony skeleton. I  still have to fix that... Anyhow, I an came over for for a while, and then he went home.

      My eyes are brown. THat's nice, isn't it? But my hair was blue today. Blue blue. Bluey blue blue blue. And I danced. Yes, I danced. And I get to draw pictures of Giant robots for this thing about... well, I dont remember, but I like giant robots. And another thing, my shoes are odd. I enjoy holding people. ofttimes they will be soft, but when they are hard, they must just need warming up. but then it's good. I like chicken  Yes, I know I'm being quite random, that's just my current mood!  Song of the Day: Cotton Eyed Joe, tEcHnO rEmIXiMeR

      Sorry it's been so long, been busy. I've had school, friends, the play, and god knows what else. I'm really tired and I have a sore throat. I think I'll be going to bed now. Besides today, I've had a good weekend. Went to Toledo, Kat's party, The game, all kinds of things. I figured I'd better write this before I forgot tomorrow. My hair might be blue tomorrow, or maybe tuesday. Havent decided yet. I surely hope I've done all my homework, I cant remember. I hope I dont get too sick, I might be unable to act correctly in the play. That would be really bad. I must be going, good bye blog man.

      I don't like my parents. They're annoying. First I get yelled at for not doing my homework soon enough, then for wanting to stay out past nine. Oh no, I'll be tired tomorrow. And I can't feed Ian anymore, and I can't have girls over if my parents aren't home--But guys are okay! That's just total sexist shit, right? I mean, I could be gay, for all she knows. Maybe I should just tell them I am so I can have girls over. Nah, that wouldnt be good, then I couldnt have guys over. then they say that maybe sometime this week they'll be willing to go on a "double date" with me and kristin to the theatre. Oh yay, going to the movies with a date and my parents. Maybe, just because, but I won't want to go with my parents. You see, when they wonder why I never hang around them, it's not because I'm just being an antisocial teen. It's because I don't like being yelled at. The yelling at of me usually takes place whenever I'm around them. They're just really high strung lately, I don't know why. It's really irritating. I just dont like being around them. That's why I'm always either out, or in my room. Not near them. I dont like it how they're always right. For god's sake, I got yelled at yesterday for doing something for Drama club before cleaning the yard.  Song of the Day: Brain Damage, Pink Floyd, Dark Side Of The Moon

      Church group is boring. I don't like it this year. Ian's there, so that's cool, but it's otherwise boring. I really don't want to be home right now. My dad threw a hissy fit about me giving Ian cheese. Apparently it was "His cheese". He apparently took it from each bag of cheese and specially made it. I just made sure to take the one farthest back, that was probably the least wanted. Freakin psycho.

      Hey, I had a really great night. the day was mediocre, and I felt similarly bad at school. We didn't do much at rehearsal, and I really need to remember my lines... Anyway, it's all good. After school I rushed home, changed into band clothes, and went for pictures. A bunch of the saxes went to KFC and bought stuff. That popcorn chicken's really good... We got back, changed quickly, and went out for practice. I hung out with Kristin most of the night, had a good time. we sat together. Apparently I'm quite warm. Ian was a lot less hyper than usual. I think he might have been cold. He's crazy. I'm crazier. Tyler mauled us, took Kristin and Ian down. Carolyn and I just kinda laughed and helped them up. I ran a lot, caught my jacket, and was nearly late to the stands. I would have done something tonight, but nobody else was, so I just came back.  I had a really good time. I have a lot to do tomorrow. There's drama things, but I don't think I can do them tomorrow, I have yardwork and homework until it's all done.  It should be okay, I might go to proproom cleanout. I dunno, it's just across the street, shouldn't be hard. Well, I think I'm going to go get to sleep. Will make entry tomorrow

      Well, obviously we did. So the day started out with me Waking up late, but I was okay. At school, I just hung out and febrezed things before first period. Kristin used me as a pillow again, which was fine, because I like it when she does that, because she's soft.  Anyhow, sometime in the middle of first period I went off to the orthodontist, I don't know why. He put rubberbands on my teeth. I think I'm going to play with this video camera a lot now, It's fun. Ian and I found it, and we worked it, but it's not very portable. the battery is nigh dead, just old, and it doesnt charge well. But it's mine, and I like it. I then went to practice, which was boring. Some peole are  total idiots, as shown by tonight. I just dont like others. anyhow, I think I'm going to go do my homework right now, as I'm not sure I'll have enough time to do it later. Ta ta! I hope I have a better day after this one.

      Sometimes I feel as if the whole world's against me. I try to be nice, I try to make friends, but there are those people that seem not to like me, even a bit. Is it too much just to ask for love? That's all I really want... Or need. It's in my nature to want people to love me, but there are a lot who don't, whether they don't like my behavior, my appearance, or my overall personality. But I still believe that there is someone who likes me for who I am. And I hope that person can also help me figure out who I am. It's understandable to want friends, it's human nature. But why do I crave love so much? Why can't I be like all of the introverted, indifferent idiots in my grade? Is it a problem of myself? I thought I had identified all of those. By far the worst is the one that makes me not tell anybody any of my problems. I don't know why I don't, It just seems right? Maybe I'm just afraid of what people will say... Maybe what they'll think. Will they think I'm not good enough? Will they believe me to be a fake? I don't want them to think what I don't want them to think... I suppose I'm being sort of manipulative, which I also don't want. It's coming along a lot like I hate myself, isn't it? I'm beginning to think I do... I mean, I don't like nearly anyone in my grade, I hang out mostly with seniors and juniors, and I don't want to be too good of friends with them because they'll be gone past this year, and that will make everything that much more difficult. Now I think I may address love. I really need it in my life. I love women, I love being with women... Unfortunately, on the rare occasion someone shares that occasion with me, guess what? They just happen to live in Maryland, or New York, or somewhere else nigh unreachable. Should I just give up?  There doesn't seem to be anything rewarding in it, beside the fact that I know about twenty girls who apparently think I'm a "great guy" and believes that I make a terrific friend. See, I won't voice any of this out to anyone.  I don't tell people things like this unless they drag it out of me. I never have. Am I that messed up?  This is my only release. I enjoy writing these things down, but ofttimes I get scared to death people will read it and judge me. That's why I'm doing this. Maybe I'll get stronger. Maybe this will make me happier. This is me. Welcome to my conflict of conscience.

      It's a boring day, I dont have anything to do so I'm posting here. I had a dentist appt. It was horrible. I dont like the dentist. Anyhow, I think I'll just watch a movie or something, I dont know what's happening now. Not even any homework. I cant draw, not in an artistic enough mood. Left my book at school. Broke the palm pilot. Dad was horribly pissed. Doesn't he get it that I dont wish it broken either? Idiot. Terrible mood I'm in. Well, I finally get to play Bari. It's good, it's got a nice low sound, unlike those annoying altos. It's cold in my room. I think I'll keep my pants on today, It'll be less chilled. I want to do things this weekend, but there's not going to be anybody here. Everyone's away for Thanksgiving. It sucks. I guess it'll just be me, on my own. Maybe I'll not be bored. Or Maybe Ben will come back before Monday. Anyway, I wont have much to do. Stupid Mr. Mulgrew gave us homework that requires money. Jerk. If I could drive, I'd go to Canada and ride mooses. Dont know why. Maybe I wouldnt, getting back would be a bitch. I think I just need to go and do something stimulating, I have at least three hours before I'll even be remotely tired. And I'm HELLA bored. You dont get how bored that makes me. Anyhoe, Harvest Moon isnt that fun, but It's good anyway. I think I'll watch the end of The Two Towers. Sometimes I think a lot of things would be easier if I didnt care. But I do care, and I cant stop that. Maybe I need a life. I hate Econ Finance. It's horrible, I had to revise Thirty fucking sheets. LAST NIGHT! And guess what! HE DIDNT COLLECT IT! Stupid bastard, giving us an assignment... I hate it. I'm going to call 104.7 and tell how much I hate All this crap. I can, the guy'll let you at 10 or so. I'm bored and tired. And I've listened to Pink Floyd too much. Which I didnt believe possible. Hello, I'm Alex and I like to be called Dimitri. I need a hug. Hardcore. So that doesnt matter. Maybe I should just go outside and freeze my ass off for a little bit, that'll take up time. I really dont have anything to do. Okay, I think I'll draw something. Like, this is taking up time, very slowly. I think this post has now become more of a rant of sorts. I think I want to go hang out with my friends. I just realized how differently my circle of friends has become since last year. It used to be me, ben, clemons, and a few others. Ben stuck around, but It's a bunch of seniors mostly now. I dont know, it's difficult to discern friends from people I know. I dont know a lot of things, I'm feeling a bit frosty. I think the machine needs to turn up, it's not warm enough. I'm going to go draw. It's one of the few things I'm good at. And I think I suck, but everyone says it's very good. I know it sucks. I'm good at it only at times, and techniques. Otherwise I suck. I cant draw worth anything. Yeah, you might like it, but it sucks. I dont have anything to do. I'm done ranting, I'm going to go draw. Fo rizzle.   -Song of the Day: Money, Pink Floyd

      Yes, I havent posted in a while. I've been doing a lot, mostly the play, which I've finished. Finally. I have Donned my Pedro for the LAST time. Thank you. And Kristin has pneumonia. WHich sucks. So anyhow, I'm getting along okay, I like to play with monet, tossing it around. I watched the wall, at Ian's. I liked it. It was very powerful. Anyhow, the lava lamp is now forverely different. I want to do things this weekend. LIke, party, movies, party with movies That sort. Anyhow, I like to play with my soul, like a rubber ball. It's fun. I think it needs a hug.  1 10|/3 j0o |

      It's been a great week. No complaints, besides the library one. Well, I'm sure there were a few, but since I dont remember them, they mustn't have been important. Had a good date today. We hung out at the mall. I saw Joe. Joe's a big man. So I got a new book. It's the sequel to the one I read. I hate yardwork. I just realized that a waffle sandwich would be somewhat of a threesome.  AHEM, anyhow... so I have a vendetta against yards now. Yes, I know the leaves give me oxygen, but no man should have to do these things. I think I may go jump into a pile of them. Just, right now. I dunno, I'm in a weird mood right now. Like I'm a pile of nothingness, something that nobody cares about. But I know it's not true, I really do. But still, I feel like that, dont know why or how. Probably some escaped unchannelled testosterone or something. Anyhow, I'm good, although I'm angry.  Song of the day- Rumor in St. Petersburg, Anastasia soundtrack

      Another good day. I got to sleep in, which made me so happy. I slept in as much as I could, and then went to school. It wasnt even that bad. I just hung out and didnt do that much for the first four classes. Fifth period (which is never unlong) was a bore, just writing about my book. I think I need to get another one by the same author. He's really good. Anyhow, day went off without a kick, and the pep rally was cool, so was walking with Kristin. Army of Darkness is a fun movie. Rehearsal was nice today, I only forgot a few lines. I'm better than Rob. I finally got my sandwich too. I hope we have another delay tomorrow. And a sammich. Or some waffles. No, wait! A WAFFLE SANDWICH! That would be sweet. I think I'll have to have some. Irealized that when I'm with Kristin, I feel better than when I'm with anyone else, except maybe Ian. No, definitely better than Ian. I don't know, I think we just go very nicely together. I think It's a good thing. A very good thing.  By the way, I never want to be alone anymore. It's just not fun.

      Woah, last night was awesome. So was the night before.  The night before was (obviously) Halloween. I went to Kevin's house after school, and just hung out for a while, me and him and Kristin and Andy and (door)Matt. We had fun with silly string. Then I went to Miss Saigon, which was a really cool play. It wasnt as good as Phantom of the Opera, but still good. Then I went to Kevin's again, and watched some movies. Sleepy Hollow had some icky scenes. Andy and Matt had to go, so it was just me with Kristin and Kevin.  Kristin is very soft and warm. Anyhow, it went on for a while and I went home the next day, where I slept, painted my shoes, and went to a movie. After the movie, I went to the dance, which was one of the most amazing experiences I've had for at least a few years. There was dancing, bands, and so much...It was awesome. I danced with Kristin. A lot. Also asked her out. I got a yes, which made me feel quite euphoric. I don't know exactly what that means, but it felt really good and I was happy. So then we all went to Waffle house, and had waffles. The real kind. Kristin likes her waffles sopping, completely soaked with syrup. It made me giggle. Yeah, it's been a superfly weekend.

      It's been a week or so. I think I should've updated, but I've been busy. Last week of schooooool of this year, savvy? Well, I spent two hours ringing bells with Kristin. It was kinda cold, but I wasnt nearly as cold as Kristin. She's perpetually cold. And I'm perpetually warm. I suppose it balances out. I had that party. It was good. And there was fun. I dont have much else to say, so Ithink I'll just write a paragraph or two of Metroid Fanfic.  Upon stepping through the door, Samus heard a strange noise, like a squelching. She looked around, pointing her blaster in front of her. After her inspection, she warily lowered her blaster, stepping forward toward the door at the end of the hall. But as she raised her arm to open the door, an explosion rattled the hall. She spun around, to find herself face to face with the SA-X. A chill ran down her spine. She'd been dreading this ever since Adam warned her. The SA-X was a mindless killing maching, one that was out to destroy Samus. The SA-X raised it's arm, and shot a wave of ice straight for Samus. Although the SA-X had all of Samus skills (and probably more), it hadnt had the years of practice. Samus flattened against a wall, wincing as the air around her froze. She kicked off, and launched an ice missile at the SA-X, watching as the ice enveloped her doppelganger, punching a button on her wrist and switching to her charge beam. Charging up a shot as fast as possible, She let it loose just as the SA-X broke free from his frozen prison, sending it back into a wall. Samus stopped for a second, taking a few steps toward the SA-X. Mistake. From the rubble of the broken wall came a blindingly blue ice beam, which came tearing through Samus's leg. She collapsed to the ground, and quickly switched into her morph ball form. Samus let a power bomb down, and sped away intothe next room, bombing a place in a nearby pipe, rolling through it, and into the safety of a distant room. She unmorphed, and set herself against the wall, tearing her helmet off and taking many deep breaths She swung her long blonde hair back, anc closed her eyes, looking at the semi-frozen gash on her leg. Wincing and looking at her armor, she heard a scuffling. She looked up to see a small beetle, which she shot very quickly. it's X-parasite floated wildly around, then down and into her leg. Instantly, it began to cauterize, and her armor began to seal itself back. "Wow.. the metroid did so much..." Samus thought, looking around. She stood, and replaced her helmet. She sighed, and wished she could just be off of this dismal, X infested ship, and get back to at least SOME planet. She blasted open a wall, getting back to a hallway, and checking her map. The nearest navigation room was a few rooms later. She had her diffusion missile upgrade; he was ready for her next objective briefing. She shot open the door, and began to walk into the darkness, her blaster raised and her senses keen...  To be continued!

      I think this one will work. I'm going to have a christmas party on saturday the 20th. Or friday. Nonetheless, it should be fun. Kristin's sick again. It seems to come and go with the utmost frequency. I think the party wont have too many people, just Ian and Kristin and Jon and some other people. I think this weekend is going to be odd. I've got from 7 to 11 or so to hang out, and I have to set up DJ stuff during that time. I need sam feet. I think I'll have to add fake hair to them. that could be good. I think I need more sleep than I'm getting. but I'm good. So I think Christmas will be cool, because christmas is fun. Just because of friends. No, not that show, the ones I've got. Lots of fun. and stuff.  Song of the Day: Split Level Head: Artist unknown

      I've been trying to write this freakin' entry for, like, three days now. It didnt work any of the five times! I think I'm going ot go hit a croquette ball through a pool full of jello. Kristin made pie and I ate some and it was quite good. It's been weird. Ian was really sad on the weekend. He just stayed at my house for most of it. The floor's cold, but it's a lot warmer when you're there to comfort your crying friend. I was a little freaked out earlier about Stuff.. I got over it. pretty fast too. I like chocolate whipped cream. good stuff. HOLY CRAP, It's shelob! I'm going as sam. I've got sam clothes mostly, but I need sam supplies. I need camping stuff, and ROPE and a backpack. yep. but I can be good, I think I can do it. With OLD BOY SCOUT SUPPLIES!!! Ahaha, exactly. I love Kristin. She's so fun to be with. Anyhow, I think my ring isnt there. I've been looking and looking. I think it must be in the bushes. I think that I can find it with my grandpa's metal detector. I'm hungry. So, I'll update this every day if possible, and every other day otherwise. Alrizzle? Why did I say that? I love you Kristin. Song of the Day: Behind Blue Eyes, LImp Bizkit/the Who

      Is it me that ruins everything, or what? I wish to think it's not me. I seem to make people sad, and happy, and sad on seperate occasions. I suppose everyone does. You know, I think it's kinda sweet, but it's probably just silly... Last night, I couldn't sleep, and I just grabbed my stuffed animal that I'd had since the day I was born, I held it, and thought about the future. I hoped to have a son, I' d probably name him Jake, because although I like the name Dimitri, Jake is more normal. And I know it probably wont happen, but I kinda wished I could marry Kristin. I could only imagine how wonderful she'd look in a wedding dress, how great of a mother she'd be. Yeah, I'm only 15, but still, I wish I could stay with her that long, or at least be able to meet somebody as kind, as good as her. It would be wonderful if possible. I could just think about how beautiful she is, how much she loves me... I fell asleep at about that point. It seemed like anything little to bicker about, any little fights didn't matter. Just some of the wonderful little things to let each other know we love each other. I feel bad I make her sad, but I know I make her happy as much as she does me, or at least I hope so...

      Hello, my name is Alex. I'm 15, corpulent, and caucasian. I like food but I can't eat it because I dont have much of a metabolism. metabilism? Metabalism? It doesn't matter. Just get the gist of it. I like to draw, but I know I'll never be as good as I want to be. I don't much like reading, and video games have lost most of their interest. I have a few friends that are really good but I still disagree with them a lot. I can do alright at school but I dont always because I'm sloppy, unorganized, and dont realize that it matters. People tell me I'm smart because I know things that are interesting, but few times are they relevant to school. I like to talk a lot and make a spectacle of myself because I'm lonely and I like attention. Sometimes people will go along with it, but I assume it's just to ease my feelings. I like to talk to myself, because I'm about the only one that quite gets my "feelings." I dont understand a lot of things. Oh, and I ABSOLUTELY HATE being led on. I like definite answers. I dislike indecisiveness. I like my coat. I need to go on a diet, but when I'm depressed, I eat, and when I eat, I'm depressed because I want to look nice, and I know I cant. I wish I could, like Ian or somebody, but I cant. I'm an idiot. I dislike artsy "modern" plays. I believe that plays mostly went downhill after about 1950. Cats? "Working?" Rent? Why? Cant we all ike the classics like Shakespeare, The Music Man, and, y'know, stuff that doesn't suck? Idiots. I appreciate actors. I dont appreciate many plays. I hate myself. I feel like a loser most of the time. When I dont, it's either because of my friends. But even they can make me feel like that.

      Mother made me work at the church. I think I still smell like Green Beans and Chicken. But that's alright. I need something that makes me smell good. I might have to look for it at the FP mall. THe Hot Topic has nice things. Scary, scary things too, but nice things.  Yep, I smell totally like beans. I hated the beans too. And that weird, weird tomato thing... It made me afraid. So, so afraid. I hope next meal doesn't scare the crap out of me too. It wont!

The feeling this night with you asleep in my arms, watching some show about some old decrepid rock band... It felt absolutely magical. I love you.Beaing mad at you is terrible. This, what we had tonight, I loved this... Everything was amazing. It was wonderous. I cant wait until tomorrow, because you'll be there. I didn't want you to leave tonight, and I still want to be with you I love you! Song of the day: Wonderful tonight, Eric Clapton

Say "It was an accident, mom". She won't buy it. But who the fuck cares!?! I need to break someone. Fuck that, I'm madder than that. I think I'm needing to hear screams. I'm fucking pissed off. I swear I'm going to break whatever I can. I might go to CR exchange and buy that little monitor just for the sick pleasure of seeing it's insides crawl out as I smash it.  I dont care with what. A hammer, TWO hammers, a fucking boulder if I have to. Hell, I'll do it with my fucking hands. I'm going to a PLAY tonight! Whoopdie fucking doo!! I dont care one way or another. Maybe the COMEDIC aspects will make me a little happier! I FUCKING DOUBT IT!!! I know I'm not going to like it as much as I should. And NO, I'm not mad, I'm just PISSED OFF!!! And I sure as hell wasn't MAD before, but fuck, I might be now!!!! If I had a black shirt and tie, I'd so be wearing them. But do I? NO, So I'll use what I HAVE!!! Leaving at seven, gotta eat!!! GOTTA FUCKING EAT, DONT I!?!?!?! GAHHH!!!!

      Tomorrow I have to see a play. Isn't that supposed to be happy, Dimi? Wont it be, Alex? No, not at all. I really don't think I'll even like it. Not because of the play, I love plays. I love acting. Pretending I'm someone else is why you're here, isn't it Dimi? Yes, I suppose, but I can't be you all the time, Alex.

      I swear, I'm going to punch right through the fucking window. And break the phone agaisnt the computer screen. Then can they contact me? Shut up Alex, you dont know what you're thinking. Moron. You should just stop it. Break the fucking Ice, stop acting like this. You can't stand her like this. Neither can I. I dont know, Dimi, it's all too  hard.

      Wow. I suck. I think I'm not taking this as I should be. I feel insensitive and like I'm one of the stupidest people there is. I should be doing something. Why aren't I? I dont know. I can't answer these questions, Dimi. You have to answer some of them. Can you? No? Well, okay, I suppose we're out of luck. At least you, Alex. You really can't, can you? Just say you're sorry, even though you weren't sure why you were mad in the first place. And of course you put the blame on someone else. Shut up Dimi. You don't know anything. You're wrong Alex. She doesn't even love you. It's all me. It's not the unintelligent, socially inept  you   that ANYBODY likes, much less has feelings of "love" for. And you're right, Dimi. I'm a failure. If I wasn't, I'd go to her and tell her I'm sorry, and hold her and love her, but I can't. I suck too much. I know you do Alex. That's why I'm here. Shut up Dimi.

      Is it that none of the songs are right, or just that they don't like  me ? Stupid little bastards.  So dad got some movies for me. A late birthday present. they're pretty good. History of the World, Young Frankenstein.. gotta love Mel Brooks, right? Or Gene Wilder. Marty Feldman's pretty cool too. but that's besides the point. The point is: Sure, he may be charming, he may be nice, but he's just a moron that doesn't know when to quit that needs to go into a pit of despair and seperate himself from everyone else. Take a guess who. No hints.

      Yay, yay, a thousand times yay. It's great. I have church to go to now. I technically missed church, but I can still go to Sunday School. But I have to go NOW! So I need to go eat and leave. Dine and dash? I think I'll have to talk to Kristin today. Ian's at school, I need to talk to him too.l

      It's all alright now. It's all worth it. love is wonderful. I know that it is. Sure, there are ups and downs, but more ups than downs. And God, do the good times make you feel so good... Just to be holding her in your arms, knowing that she loves you as much as you do to her... it's euphoric. Everything's good.   Little darling the smile's returning to their faces  Little darling it seems like years since it's been here  Here comes the sun, here comes the sun  And I say it's AMAZING!!!  Song of the while: Here Comes the Sun, Harrison, Beatles, Abbey Road.

      I'd like to say I'm sorry. But I dont think I can. I dont think that there's anything to say that hasn't already been said. It wasn't the greatest feeling last night to sit alone in the dark of Ian's basement,  but I think it was better than having to sit up there with the crowd of people that either I like a lot or despise. Sometimes you can't even tell the difference.

      Is it me, or not? Why does this always happen? Why do I only bring hurt, and pain? Is the fact that people like me just for the facade I put up why? I doubt that people really care for me, at least the me that the REAL me. I think they just like the outside character I put up when I'm trying to make friends, or imptess someone. Sure, I'm happy sometimes, but whenever I act spur of the moment or anything, IT always makes things worse. I think everything might be better if I didnt ever speak, if I just kept my mouth shut and stayed in the background. Then I'd be sad all the time, but at least everybody else would be fine. I think that sounds like a good idea. But I'll never be able to do that. My personality wouldn't allow it. Am I just a failure at life? Or just at any sort of a relationship with another person? Sometimes I wish I could be invisible, so people wouldn't always be asking "What's wrong?". It's annoying, and the only people that need to know already do. Will they do something about it? No. At least not for a while. People suck. Sometimes they're alright, but then their colors show and they're complete assholes. Sometimes I think that it would be a good idea just to seperate myself entirely from everybody. Some people are just annoying all the time. Some are just idiots. I hate it when people seem appealing, nice, and whatnot, but then once you show that you are indeed an idiot, they suddenly become what you  like the least.  What a happy year. Especially my birthday. Hoo-rah for that.

      Well, it's my birthday. I'm 17. Yessum, that's FIFTEEN! Ignore the seven. FFX-2 involves skimpy bikinis. I got some CDs, like the new beatles one. Let it be... naked. Sounds like something I'd say. I was playing all day. IT was fun. And yesterday I played at the Red Lobster. By played I mean ate. It was good. Ian and Steven took me stalking. I somehow got roped into a burger, a sub, and a milkshake. I love milkshakes. we pranked the drive thrus. it was good  then there was the stalking. Anyhow, after that, I slept. I'm fifteen. This many *holds up both hands and one foot*. Yay, now Kristin can't make fun of me because of my age! At last.. I need black clothing. better for stalkering. the hair dye is seeping out. and the roof is leaking. I think I'll leave, happy Birthday Alex! (happy birthday Alex)

      Dont you just hate it when people are being hippocritical? Sure, you can love them more than anybody else, but they can still do things that make you angry. I dont quite know  why  I'm angry like this, it seems rather insignificant. It's just better when you know what's going on, you know? Is it just that I overthink things? Maybe it's sometimes just stupid how I think, but forget it.  I shouldn't worry about this, it's probably nobody's fault, mostly just me, overthinking  it.  I hate it when I dont know what to do. I dont know who to blame, but most likely it's myself. But so often people say "Don't place the blame on anyone." But you have to.  It's quite the annoying-as-hell situation. Hot damn, am I ever pissed. But still I dont know why. Sometimes those little things make you mad, but it's not them that makes you REALLY mad. So a little thing made me mad, alright. THEN I suppose that I just got overly pissed because I'm being paranoid. Not knowing what to do in situations like this is the real pisser. Yeah, yeah, "Learn from past experiences" and all that shit. But I'd sometimes rather know. Although not knowing makes it all exciting. But it fucks you up too. Sometimes you just want to take your guitar and throw it through the window and hope it breaks something else, anything. My friends are so fucking boring. I wasn't in the best mood, so I decided that hanging out with Jon would make it better, which it did, until the mall, wherein I got severely bored. It's boring there. This whole fucking town is boring, especially when you dont know what the hell you did or how you can fix it, or even if you CAN.  Semitemos uoy tnod wonk yhw uoy era dam. bUT YOU STILL HAVE TO TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT. nObOdY cAn FiGuRe OuT wHy YoU hAvE tO eVeN cArE sO mUcH. But then you realize that you just have to, because you're human. Doesnt it bother you when you try to understand and comprehend why it's happening, but the only other person/s involved wont tell you what's going on?  I didn't mean to hurt you, ever. I love you too much to. I'm just stupid in my thinking, and I need to talk more openly, if possible. Now I think I can cope, at least... but I still wont feel good. I hope you see this.

      This is what we call a shitty, shitty day. A few days ago, I had my adnoids removed. Dont ask what they are, but they're in my throat. Hell, I didn't even know what they did. Anyway, I'm still feeling bad about that. So then I'm trying to recouperate, and I get my midterm. Some of my worst grades ever. Another blow to the shitty factor. And on top of that, my neck hurts, my nose is quite stuffed, and I have an umpteen page report on pirates due  last thursday . So I'm working on that right now. At least I HAVE all of my cards and my outline. God, I'm such a loser... I hope I can do it alright, and in time. So I'm off to do that, but I'd like to give the world a big FUCK YOU.

In fact, I hate school so much that I think I might do as fucking much as I can to get into TSA. Maybe I can find someone who'd take me there every day. It would be brilliant. I hear it's easy, and you get to act. I hate our school so much... I want to go to TSA SO BAD! PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ME ESCAPE FROM THIS HELLHOLE! I DONT CARE IF I'LL BE AWAY FROM MY FRIENDS, I CANT STAND THIS SCHOOL!!! SOMEBODY TAKE ME AWAY!!! I WANT TO BE AN ARTIST!!! I DONT FUCKING CARE ABOUT AESTHETICS!!!! I hate Mulgrew. Papers enough to fill a fucking bear. I'm being overworked... I might just not be able to continue it. Maybe I can get voted out of the class. None of my teachers like me. Honestly, I'm NOT joking. They all yell at me. I know it. I've gotta straight up, I've gotta do this. And right now I HAVE TO DO MY OUTLINE!!!

      The fourth one, however, might be enough to get your space-blood pumping - imagine if you will a seven dimensional penis which can project beyond time, and even through solid matter. This metadong can be everywhere and nowhere at once, its exact physical state is constantly in flux. You might think of this scenario as somewhat emasculating, because if someone asks you (for example) if you have the balls to do something, you have to very earnestly reply that you might or you might not, it's kind of a quantum thing. On the other hand, ask that motherfucker if he can have sex with anyone who ever existed, ever, even if they were trapped inside a safe. See what I'm talking about? With an infinite wang, this and much more is possible. Well, I guess I should say probable. It's kind of a quantum thing.

      Oh what a wonderful night! The whole day was brilliant. I was sickly yesterday, but I perevered through, and today was absolutely brilliant. First, I woke up and got ready to go as if there was a delay, but we were CLOSED!! And then I had to shovel, but it was warmish out, so I was fine! And then Ian came over, and we went over to Squeekers. We hung out, met this crazy, crazy girl, and Tyler and Misty came. Misty's pretty cool, I didn't really like her apartment though. Then I came and hung for a bit, and then went to Amber's party. Rob took me. We were there for a bit, and we did the present thang, I got my nips tweeked a few times by some diff'rent folks, and we chilled. Kristin's amazing. I could just sit and hold her, and talk with her for hours. She's so brilliant, so vibrant, energetic. I wish that car ride never ended. I wish we could've just sat in the back seat of Tracy's car, not making out, just holding each other... It was brilliant.

      Ach, It's been a while. So there's not much to say. But it's been three months. Wow, I think my contacts are killing me. Today's been long. I cleaned, then ate more than I should've, and watched a shload of Monty Python with the guys. Then Rob and I hung out and Ian was being all thoughtful and stuff, which really conflicted with Rob's and my moods. And hen I came home. I have a secret mission that none of you can know about. Ha! And I figured out the puzzle. So I had to eat. I'm tired and my eyes hurt. Super bowl tomorrow. I love you Kristin, and I wish I was sleeping with you right now.

      Okay, I need to clarify things, for me, for you, for somebody who cares. I was mad last night because I was trying to be myself, and it apparently didn't agree with you. I'm sorry. I apologized, I tried to make things to do, I like it when you act like yourself But you didn't want to play with me.

      I tried to make it better. I really fucking did. I know I screwed up, but I can't go back and fix that. I can't talk to Ian; he's off doing something with an unknown chica. I had more chocolate than I should've, I'm pondering what more I can do for the situation. I think there's nothing more. I've tried everything I can think of. I'm going to go shoot things, hopefully the game I rented shows realistic blood. I'm sorry, Kristin. I thought of all I can do, and It hasnt helped. James Bond is my favorite action hero of all time. Of all of the twenty films he's been in, either the earliest or the newest ones are my favorite. The earliest have great acting by Sean Connery, and cheesy special effects. The new ones have decent acting and brilliant explosions. I believe I prefer the newer ones, simply because I enjoy explosions. James Bond--if real--would be a knight in Britain. I wish I was as cool as James Bond. Too fucking bad I'm not, nor will I ever be anywhere half as cool as James Bond, in any of his incarnations.

      I'm not sad. I'm not feeling sorry for myself. I'm just angry. I dont like the way things happen. All of the systems are righteously fucked up. Is that it? I dont know. I just dont trust people. Sometimes I feel underappreciated, sometimes overappreciated. I dont like stereotypes. I'm not going to write a rebuttal, hell, it probably won't even be in the damn paper, which comes out what, every three months? Anyway, I dont know when I'll be less mad, maybe when I can actually have a conversation about it without somebody just trying to either A) Change the subject, B) Shoo me away, or C) reject everything I say. Boy, that Dylan Thompson's a bitch. I DONT HAVE TWELVE DOLLARS. And fuck your seniority. Ian's a senior, I treat him like an equal. I don't even want a fucking T-shirt. Technically I did have the money, but apparently dimes isn't good enough for people. Nobody actually sits down and talks to me. Well, my parents do, but Mom's sick and dad's overworked so they're about useless, and Ian does... I suppose that's why he's my best friend. I'm about to get grounded further in umpteen ways, partially because I think some of my grades actually got lower... fuck it. I think I'll just do an easy job and get by, if I can't be an actor. Lockers hurt when you punch them.  I tried to be nice today. Some people were nice to me, like that weird chick who kept groping my hair, the people at the tables around tyler, and Ian, and John and matt (They gave me cookie cash). I have to pay them back. I have money for them. I hope dimes work.  Technically I'm poor as shit. I pay for emergencies in dimes and I get everything else from the 'rents. things too expensive. And I will be a fucking thespian by the end of the year. Tom Sawyer, Much Ado, all of those plays I saw at the Stranahan and all of the Drama meetings, States, and the Talent show should be enough. I DID do crew on Tom Sawyer. And moving a wall is MOVING A WALL. It's a fucking wall! Crew's crew! Why the fuck should it matter where it's done?!!? Stupid ignorant bitch. Isn't it funny how you try to be nice, and try not to be angry, but being avoided DOESNT HELP THE PROBLEM. People ofttimes DONT LIKE to be avoided. Fuck it, I'm going to bed. Talk to me if you want. If you dont, go right ahead with that too.

      Between the groundings and everything, I think I've managed to hold together pretty well. Whatever happens, I take it with a smile. Usually. Otherwise I just feel all..hm... not good, like this. I just try to help people. Usually. Ofttimes it doesn't work. like now. Sorry I tried. I'll just leave you alone until you feel like talking to me, let you cool off, and then...aw hell, I dont know. I think I'll stop being helpful to people. It usually doesn't end up well for me. I dont want to be a bully; I like being nice, but people are suspicious, cruel, and untrusting. I  understand   nothing    about     what      is       going        on I think I'll just try to shut up more often, and learn to take hints before I allow the shit to hit the fan. no; I think I'll just listen better and talk less. That could help. and if it doesn't, then maybe I should rethink it all and be meaner than usual. I know I can. But I wont; I like being nice. I like helping people. But I'm bad at it... Thus negating the help, and making me feel bad. I think I'm angry and need to break a window with some part of myself, feel the sheer satisfaction of the shattering glass, the tears in your skin... it's a good feeling. painful as all hell, but it's a rush to the soul.  Isn't it good to feel pain sometimes? Not all the time. I'm Perpetual Romeo. Because I'm the only fucking person in that class that can act right off the bat; Improv, fucking improv. I know Ed can act, but he's terrible at it. Fucking monotone...  So, recap; like to help people, bad at it, perpetual romeo, will be less active and write more. Sounds fucking delicious.

      First of all, you dont make any fucking sense. Why are you mad? I dont fucking know. I didn't try to fight, I just avoided you because you seemed like you wanted to be alone, get attention, etc. I dont know! But anyway, I was trying to be nice or whatever, but apparently I can't fucking succeed. get over it, I dont know why you're still mad, and I don't know why you won't stop. Just calm down and stop being mad. I was a little overwhelmed this morning. I didn't know you were going to act like you did, and I was trying to avoid you so I didn't get in deep shit.  Second, I hugged Rob because he was there, and he just walked in. I was going to hug you when you left, assuming you wanted it. Then I tried to hug you, but Kevin intercepted and I hugged him. So? Then I tried to hug you, but you wouldn't let me. I'm sorry, really.

      Yo, I'm Alex. How goes this? Wait, that's my question. I'm the Phantom. Apparently there's bowling tonight w/Amber, but meh. I wasn't invited, nor do I  care . Ian's coming over, Liz is staying fo a few days (yes, it IS fo.), and it's me they hear. Damm! Too many operatic phantoms! Nonetheless, it shall be good, for I enjoy being in moods of the good persuasion. Tracy came over last night, and we hung out, played pool and talked. It was nice, having another good friend to talk to. But Maggie called, and that was weird. She calls the weirdest times. Meh, let it go! Talea and Rachel invited me over today, and they, Ian and I all sewed, for some reason, and hung out with the dogs, while putting the magnetic monkeys in precarious positions. Oh, and I'm tired of changing myself, and kissing everybody's ass all the time just to please them, and sometimes getting little or nothing in return. The new philosophy is "If you dont like it, then F U C K  Y O U!!!" I think it's a decent way of thinking. Well, Ben should be coming soon for his CD, and Ian should be over sometime. I hope he does come, he's my buddy. And a good buddy! iTunes is perhaps the greatest program ever, I must say. Yeah, it's been a good day. Saw Hellboy, that was quite good. Really, really cool stuff, like this dude named Abe Sapien, and he was like a frogman! It was sweet. Hellboy himself was pretty cool too, but ABE! Man oh man, it reminded me of a certain Gonzales. So, mom needs to finish cleaning this place.  "She's not allowed to spend all her time in the shower! And if she does shower, it WILL be with ME!" I'm not sure the person who said that would enjoy his name being stated. So Woo! Freebird? Ja.

      Now I know! And I will dance forever in the sunset! Or will I? With my mighty spoon of justice, with which I will destroy the evil one with!... Which is That who's name shant be spake! ...okay, just this once. EMILY ZIMMERMAN Evil of evils, bitch of bitches, whore of whores ANd Talea and Rachel Frokedanced with her! I despise that. I liked states, I saw plays, at states.  Liberty, Justice, and the pursuit of Porn is all that matters in life. Right, Abe?

      Still dont know.  Do you have the time to listen to me whine About nothing and everything.. all of it. I am one of those Melodramatic fools Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid? I'm just stoned.  Everybody tells me to do it. But it's so hard. I dont know. I dont know if I can handle it, but on the other side, I dont know if I can take this happenning over and over again. Grr.

      I had a weekend  Okay, I have no Idea what to do. I figure I have two options that are rational. But I dont know which one. I dont want to hurt anyone, but I dont want to be hurt either. I'm so lost, I need help! Anybody!   Call me...anybody.

      Okay, so it was my fault. I'll get over it.  So this weekend is cool so far. It started out as kinda boring, went to the place, saw Talea and Rachel presumably stoned and walked home with Ian. Then I played some DDR. It was good. Matt says we'll teach me how to play so I can then school those little kids and James. Ooh! Then I went to Kat's house. I was the first one there, so Travis (Kat's father figure) was talking to me. Kinda creeped me out at first, but he's a pretty nice guy. Likes to talk. Then Will and Brett come over and We're hanging out, eating chips, and then we find the  lighter fluid . WOW was that cool. We were having the best time, and people just kept yelling at us! Whatever, it was all worth it. And that dog was awesome, and I mean AWESOME. That little beast never tired! I want it to come over and play with my dogs, tire my dogs out. That would be cool. Ian played me some old tyme pianney on the piano. So altogether, it wa sneat. all kinda meat. no, neat. Righto.So on goes life, I'm going to find some friends and do something before night. Los byeos!

      *sigh* Hi. I haven't written in a while, I guess I just haven't been in the mood. So much has happened. Anyway, school's almost over and I'm about ready to give up. My brain is fried, and I mean fried. I can't think right. I can't remember anything. Like, nothing at all. It's hard to just think. I would've forgot about that band concert if it weren't for my dad. Lord... It's not right. I SHOULD know. I mean, I've always known stuff.  Known more than a lot of people. But I just can't anymore. I didn't even get Thespian. I saw them being walked around... Yeah, I should be there too. But no; something was wrong. I could feel it. It wasn't there; I know it's all my fault. I must've forgotten to turn in Tom Sawyer's points. It sucks. I was looking forward to this. But Oh well... It's my fault anyway. Damn, I really wanted that. Oh well. I'll get it next year... I was hoping not to have to wait that long though... Maybe if I talked to G... No, she probably wouldn't care. I don't know, I'll do it anyway. I really wanted that. I knew I had enough Much Ado: 3 Tom Sawyer: 3 plus 1(crew) States: 3 One Acts: 2 or 3 Festival of the Arts: 1 or 2 All together: 13 to 15 And you only need 10... WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!  Even WITHOUT Tom Sawyer I had enough! But NOOOOO, I need a fucking Crew point! That's shit. I went to STATES, pait $100 for that and I took workshops and saw a lot of things! SHOULDN'T THAT COUNT AS SOMETHING ELSE?! God, stupid rules, I should be a fucking thespian! Watch, I'll find out later today that I AM one. Then this'll all be for naught. Stupid Alex. It's all my fault. It has to be. Well, I'm off to do that damn powerpoint for EF class... GOD! I hate this. I want to go away.  I don't want to be here. I dont want this. I want to go away. I don't want to be here. I'm thinking of leaving, seriouslyu this time. I'm tired of it, I'm just tired of it. I want to go away...

      "I went to the dance, which was one of the most amazing experiences I've had for at least a few years. There was dancing, bands, and so much...It was awesome. I danced with Kristin. A lot. Also asked her out. I got a yes, which made me feel quite euphoric. I don't know exactly what that means, but it felt really good and I was happy. So then we all went to Waffle house, and had waffles. The real kind. Kristin likes her waffles sopping, completely soaked with syrup. It made me giggle. Yeah, it's been a superfly weekend."   "Irealized that when I'm with Kristin, I feel better than when I'm with anyone else, except maybe Ian. No, definitely better than Ian. I don't know, I think we just go very nicely together. I think It's a good thing. A very good thing. By the way, I never want to be alone anymore. It's just not fun."  the end.

      I've always worried about myself. And besides, I dont like getting yelled at. I'm trying to get it stopped with whatever means necessary. No haircut, maybe some other changes. I'm thinking tied in back, but also I could wear nice shirts all the time with shorts. Maybe a tie. So anyhow, I'm tired of being mad, and this is more infuriating than anything, so I think it's best for me to do my homework. I'm going to take a lock of Ian's hair.

      And even though I'm pretty sure that post will get you mad Kristin, I'm being open. I guess you have a right to know. I needed to get the rage out, and that was how I chose. You deserve to read it, I dont know why I'd hide it. I know it'll probably get you pissed, and I won't be mad at all tomorrow (probably). But still, it had to be posted. It had to be. Sorry.

      Gah! I never know what the fuck I do. I try to be nice, but I ALSO try to get some of the fucking things that I want. Is that wrong? IS THAT FUCKING WRONG?! I was trying to be nice!!! And because I  didnt know  that I was doing something wrong, I get punished? WHAT THE FUCK!? God! I'm fucking changing myself right now. I'm getting a haircut tomorrow, I'm working on Anthem well enough to attempt to get a good grade, and I'm going to hang out with Ian. FUCK, maybe I'll attempt being gay! I'm tired of being punished like this, for THINGS I DIDNT KNOW WERE WRONG!!! What the fuck?! Gah! I dont deserve this! I dont deserve this! DONT FUCKING DO THIS TO ME!!! GAH!!! FUCK!!! I dont need this! I fucking try to be nice, and this is how I'm fucking treated? I know it was a nice gesture, I thanked you greatly! I'm being nice! I'm SORRY if you thought otherwise! IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT THAT CHICK WAS HOT!!! I'm a fucking teenage boy, what do you expect me to think!?!?!? THE FUCKING SKETCH was about her being hot! I'm SORRY!! It was on my fucking mind!!! SORRY!!! GaH!!!!!! I was trying to be very grateful, which I WAS, those were fucking delicious ribs! But i dont know if I want to be, if I'm just going to be fucking treated like this!!! I'm SORRY!!! You wouldn't tell me what's wrong, that's NOT MY FAULT!!!! AND WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?!?! If it didn't matter, you should have fucking told me! GAH!!! WHY THE FUCK DO yOU DO THIS!!! GAH!!! FUCK!!! THIS ISN't RIGHT!!! I never meant to do anything offensive, I fucking swear! I didn't mean to try to "get under your skin", maybe those things happen when we're both in weird moods!!! I DONT FUCKING KNOW!!! But dont fucking punish me like this when I dont even know what the fuck's wrong!!! FUCKING TALK TO ME!!! GAH!!! Stop doing this!! STOP!!! I was trying to be nice!! I  wanted  to be nice!! It's not my fucking  fault  that I wasn't good enough! BUT DONT PUNISH ME LIKE THIS!!! Talk to me!! THat's all I wanted! I didn't want to yell or anything, it's not like it's my fucking fault if it comes out by accident!! I didn't know you were hurt by it!! I'M FUCKING SORRY, BUT STOP DOING THIS!!! ANd normally, I probably would push it off, but you were nice to me so I'm trying to make htis better! Stop being so bitter, I was only kidding, and it's not my fucking fault! God! Stop doing this to me! I love you ,but this has to NOT HAPPEN. It's horrible for my brain, my body, my FUCKING MENTAL STATEwhich isn't getting a fucking smidgeon better. I'm sorry I'm YELLING, but I cant fucking help it. I'm not that happy. you were mean to me. It wasn't meant for me to be mean to you,  I didn't mean it  . Look, I'm sorry I hurt you, but you didn't have to go right around and return the favor, on purpose nonetheless. SERIOUSLY, it's not right. If it was hurting you, or making you mad, TELL ME, I would listen, I fucking swear! Don't I usually listen if it's really something serious like that? And even if it seems like I dont, I do. So at least fucking talk to me, that's the least that can be done. I won't probably be mad tomorrow, but likely after reading this you will, so I'm sorry. Thanks again for the food, even though right now I'm fumingly.. well, not mad, so much as irritated, or possibly just irate. I'm not in a good mood, let's fucking put it that way. I never tried to be mean; you did. I'm sorry, I  know  it's what you always do when you're tired, but please try to refrain, and instead try to get me not to be mad at you. I think I'm going to get a haircut tomorrow or the day after, maybe try to get colored contacts and some new clothes, or at least new ways to wear the ones I have. I'm tired of me, I get yelled at too fucking much. I figure if I can figure out how to change my outer appearance, It'll be easier to change my inner self as well. And it's a shame, but maybe new alex won't get yelled at as much. Maybe he'll be Alexander, or just Lex. I dont know, but he'll get yelled at a fucking lot less. I'm sorry for yelling, I didn't mean to yell on the phone if I even did, but again I  just wanted to talk.  You have to be blunt with me, I dont get things, so just tell me! I need to know things, so I dont get yelled at as much. Maybe Lex will know how not to get yelled at. only time will tell. Right? So fuck it, he's gonna be different. I hope.

      Someday, Somewhere, I'll walk out of a building. And all of my friends, everyone I know... They'll all be there. And you know what? They'll be clapping. Not just clapping, screaming, applausing.. They'll be so loud that I won't know what's going on! I'll saunter down the steps, thanking people as I go. Everyone will be congratulating me as I go.  They'll be throwing things, crying, just being happy. I'll go down to a vehicle, and enter. Then I'll drive away, and everybody will continue cheering. We'll drive away until it's just a scream in the distance. But I'll still know what's going on. At that point... I would lie down. Because when something that incredible happens? It'll probably be my funeral. I'm sick. Not coughcough sick, sick in the brain. I'd give so much just to have people love me. That's creepy. I can't stop it, so I'll go with it. I'd do almost anything if I could get everyone to love me. That's why I act. I can't just be a face in the crowd. I have to do something with my life, but I'm always afraid that I won't be good enough. I need to get over that. I've dreamt countless times about this. Bowing after a great play, everybody clapping for me, everybody crying because they loved me so much. I'm a freak, aren't I? I refuse to be a face in the crowd.

      *sigh* It's hopeless. I figure now I might as well be as nice as I can. Try to get over it. Maybe things will eventually work out for me, maybe they wont. I'm sure it'll get better in time. I only hope I'm not a victim of bad timing at a later point in time again. I'm trying to look at this as brightly as possible. There's nothing I can do elsewise. I know I'm going to cry, I know I'm going to be crushed, but I'm going to try and stop getting everybody else down. I apologize. I'm very tired. I need something to get my mind off of it. White Castle, here I come.

      "Just wait, Alex. Maybe when she goes away she'll find herself like you did."  "Yeah, maybe when she comes back she'll want to be with you."   No, you stupid fucking gullible morons. Why the fuck would she choose ME? I have nothing to offer; Steven, on the other hand, is better looking, nicer, and will probably be better for her. She'll just spend two weeks thinking about him and how she misses him. And I'm just an annoyance that happens to be in love. My mom says to have two guys in love with you is a terrific ego boost... but the guys will feel like shit. Oh, wait, maybe just the one who's devoting himself completely that's just wanted on the side as a friend.&nbsp; Good feeling, that.&nbsp;

      I shouldnt be doing this. I should stay away for my own benefit. Am I being selfish? I dont think so... I talked to Jessica and she made sense out of it for me, if only just a little bit. Ian says wait. My mom says to get over it. Matt says that he warned me. And he did. He warned me that this would happen. I'm sorry I didnt listen to you, Matt. I wish I did. My other friends say wait. They say that school wil lbe better. I'll be with people again. Sure. I think that might just make it worse. On the bright side, I'll probably get in less trouble (I'll be much more mellow). I cant do anything on Saturday because my cousins are coming. I think. My uncle's a bit flaky, but I think they'll be here. Maybe time alone is what I need. NO, that wont work, I need to be around people. I need to give Amber&nbsp;a present. I need to convince Ian to change his clothes. I need to go to White Castle with George. Grandma is almost done with my room. Then the carpet will come in, they'll put the tape up, and then we can put the bed in, and the computer; tv, clothes, foosball table, the whole shebang. *sigh* I miss happiness. Even when I'm having a good time, I still feel bogged down and empty. I'm probably rambling now. So it goes. I need to finish my book. I need to sleep more. I need to mow the lawn. Life goes on without me. I dont like matt and Dan's apartment. It's smoky, and there's a lot of stupid people *coughmaggieandherfriendscough* at any given time. Ian and I are going to mostly stay here or his house. I've not been having much fun, though, which makes me even more depressed. A cycle, if you will. I should write songs. Y'know, those emo songs that are really sad that you can identify with. Something like that. I'll try to act regular. This is going to hurt.

I hate it all, I hate it! Why me?! Why did I have to be too LATE?! I wish I could just not care. That would be fucking brilliant. But as it is, I dont have any reason to hope.

      This is a story about a boy. This boy was your basic, everyday boy. he lived his life one day at a time, going on and on. Nothing was especially awful. One day, this boy got a ticket. He didnt know what this ticket was for. So he ripped it up, and went on with his life. A few weeks later, he realized what that ticket was for. He ran to the train, trying to get to his destination, but he wasnt allowed on. it was a private train. So he sighed, and retreated for a long time to his room, all alone. He hoped as much as he could that someday, maybe there would be another ticket; another train.  That's the last I'm going to speak of it.

      Well, I had a week. I was away in Indiana at a church convention. I've had better. The beginning was absolutely horrible, but it was Okay by the end. Again, I've had better. I was just really sad the whole week. Hell, I'm sad now. I can't say I'm completely hopeless, but I'm not the happiest.&nbsp; I finally got my hair cut. It's short and un-mullet-esque. See, on the bright side I'll be much calmer during school especially. It's definitely not the worst for anyone but me. I think it's fine for anyone but me. Whatever, though. I need sleep. Nevermind, just beat me up when you see me (that's for anyone). Toodlez

      I loathe myself. She still loves me, she still wants to hold me and kiss me, but she CANT!! And now I'm going away for a week! WHO'S DOING THIS TO ME?!!? Why the hell do I deserve this!?&nbsp; I can barely stand this as it is...there's this feeling in my chest that is just terrible... It makes me feel as if I cant live anymore... I wish I had somebody to blame this on, someTHING, but I simply cant. There is this one guy, though... He's tall, like 6' or so, has some brown hair... Nice eyes. Man, I hate that kid. That damn Alex Nader. he's ruined it all. IF I WAS ONLY A LITTLE EARLIER!!!! Kristin, I'm so so so so sorry that I ever, EVER made you feel like this! You dont deserve it, and you never did. I just want to be with you, Kristin... I hope to god that it gets better. I cant live like this. I need you, Kristin. I need you more than anything else. I hate myself. I hate myself more than anything else. If I was only a little earlier, if only I didnt yell at you... You kissed me on the hand.&nbsp; I've been staring at it, wishing it was my lips, wishing you could be with me... There's no chance. Steven won't break up with you. He really likes you. But I hope that he does. I hope he does before it gets too serious. Because I love you, Kristin Elisabeth Rakas. I love you more than anything I've ever loved before. I'm glad you know it.

WHY DO I ACT THIS WAY?! I cant do this anymore, I fucking cant DO this anymore!!!! I dont even have anybody that I can tell everything to! I need somebody! HELP ME!! HELP!!!!! I cant do this, I CANT DO THIS!!!! Gah, I'm such a fucking loser! I CANT STOP MY FEELINGS!! Why did I be an asshole!? WHY DID I HAVE TO GO ON THAT STUPID FUCKING TRIP?! I'm seriously going to go cry; I cant take this, I cant take this, I can't take this... WHY ME?! WHY ME?!?! Fuck!

      I wrote a big long post yesterday about a lot of crap I was feeling; unfortunately, it was on my dad's laptop, which the internet stopped on RIGHT before I could post. I dont even remember much of it. I was basically feeling craptasticular. I'm much better now; I realized that some things are meant to be unobtained. Somehow I'll be helped by an outside source; It happened. I'm better now. Still a little bad-feeling, but I still think that I'm much better now. Break your dreams with reality. Shatter them. Destroy them. So, now I'm going to help Ian with his Eagle. Don't look into that one.

      So we watched the Butterfly effect today. Ian was a little snappy, but I'm not blaming him. it's a shame, I dont think he can come on the mission trip. It's going to be okay anyway. Will and Dylan are still going.  So back to the movie; it was good, but really sad. Tracy cried, and I felt bad that I couldn't do anything. Rob hadn't taken his medicine, so he was a little hyper-er than usual. Then Rob left, and Ian left, and Tracy and I went to the movies with Mark. Kristin was supposed to come, but she didn't. Oh well. King Arthur was good, even though Tracy was nibbling on my shoulder for some reason. Keira Knightley is hot. Anyway, that gets over and we break into Rob's house again. We hid his Bionicles this time. He and Kevin looked for them, while Tracy ran around hyper and Mark and I just wandered. I made rob bleed, but it was an accident. We all acted odd. Oh well, it's over now. It was a fun time anyway. I just feel kinda pathetic right now, but that's to be expected. From just simply knowing what people want, I can piece together everything and figure out that I'm not it. I mean, sure, people like me and all, I'm usually pretty nice and funny. But I dont think there's any room for long-term companionship in it. You always see the animes where the girls all like the annoying stupid boy, but that never ever happens. If you're really annoying and all, they wont like you. You have to be cool, you have to work harder than it's worth. Or is it? Anyway, Ian's coming over tomorrow, then I'm probably doing something on friday and saturday. Then I'm gone for a week, back for a few days, then gone again. Yay for church.

      Back to the thing. I actually had a good time yesterday. My lesson was some fine cantering, and then I had to mow the lawn. It wasnt too bad, but it was bright, so my eyes hurt. I was in one of those moods like Edward Norton in Fight Club when he was beating the shit out of that blonde dude. Then I went to Ian's house, cooled off, and we went downtown. I stole a sign from a yard and used the stick for my own evil purposes. Then we were at the Grounds for a while, reading and eavesdropping, and Tracy came over. We visited with these people I didnt know outside of Grounds, and then we came back here and watched some Star Warz. Yes, with the Z. Tracy and Ian are coming back today to hang out again. Good times happen. Life's kinda like a teenage romance right now, ain't it? Well, things will be sorted out. I'll be fine. Mission trip on sunday. The only kids going are Ian, Will, Dylan Bielen and myself. I think it'll be awesome, even though everything in that damn town closes at 7 at night Except the Creamery! That's a great place with a lot of Ice cream. i like it. It's open til NINE! We'll hang out outside until then. w0o+ s3z +3h @13x!!11!!!1!!11111!

      Havent done this in a while; been gone. Camp was decent, though I've had better. I think it was the endless sermons, two, three, five times a day. (Yay...?) Anyway, I got past it and really bonded with that horse I was riding. Better than people, I say. People expect you to know so much about them; when if you're like me, you dont. I'm not going to sway the truth or anything; I do the same thing. People are altogether broken. Always have been, probably always will be. I'll write more when I get back, but now I've a lesson to go to.

      I think I'm dying. I'm pretty sure the amount of funnel cake and slushie that I've consumed is enough to kill a smaller man. Ugh... remind me to never nosh like that again.I think I'm sick. Seriously. George is so smart. And now we've got a pact. I hope I dont die first. I need to go work out. I'm going back though. I'm going back! Dammit, back! Ugh... I need to draw and take some tums.
