      Bonjour.  You know what I had for breakfast? I had 2 (big) bowls of cereal and then a chocolate biscuit, and now I feel really really sick and I don't think I'll ever eat again. But the cereal was good...come to think of it so was the biscuit.  I was trying to tidy my bedroom - the room is beyond belief, seriously. It's like becoming disgusting. I think that tomorrow I'll spend all day tidying it to make it spick and span!  I start my new job today. I am going to be one of those really annoying telephone folks, y'know who phone you up at dinner time, or just as That 70s show is starting and ask to speak to the home owner etc etc...yeah that's me now. But it's Â£5 an hour...and seeing as I'm such a capitalist I need money.   Prom is really really soon, I had like this plan. Before prom I was going to like work out...so I'd look good in my dress which is absolutely stunning, and I was gonna like get a tan, and do all this other stuff and now I'm just like 'meh'. I don't suppose it really matters, does it?! I mean knowing my year at school, we're just going to get really drunk and I'm certain we'll all have K.Od by around 2a.m. so nae danger, I guess.   I've kinda stopped thinking about Dan, I guess it really is over - I always thought we'd have a thing forever but perhaps not. Kirsty must be good to him! She's really very pretty so I guess he's like head over heels...not as I had hoped - on the rocks!  I convinced Amy to get a job at space kitchens too, so she's gonna start tonight too (I hope) which is good cause I was feeling a little scared...but Amy makes it all better! She broke up with Danny (my very good looking ex, who I introduced her to) yesterday and said that he took it hard so I may phone him later, I feel sorry for him...this keeps happening to him!  However for now, I have an untidy bedroom and a shower both calling out my name *sigh*

      You're better off without him Don't call him He's breaking your heart.  He's hanging with your best friend And you're waiting there It's tearing you apart.  He lied to you a thousand times, When I was there he kept you waiting.  And I'm still here waiting there To catch you if you fall. I don't know why I care so much When I shouldn't care at all.  Finally got the nerve to tell you How much you mean to me You said that I was your best friend, A real sweet guy But that's all I'd ever be.  I think that if we changed all the he's to she's and hims to hers, this song would reflect my current 'love' situation perfectly. Me and Dan have always had a thing for each other but something always gets in the way...like me having a boyfriend and now him having a girlfriend, but I think that with us both moving away soon and going in seperate directions for uni and stuff, I am just a bit like "ohhh I wish I had done something about him" so I went to his house one day, and it was cool, I wanted to tell him but I know that he's in love (or something like it) with Kirsty and I'm scared. And now Steven's come along, and he just seems so much cooler than Dan, and he's so lovely and like...alternative and he works in that cool music shop but there's just something about Dan that I want.   *~just because I don't believe in Marxism~*  I feel like I should talk to Dan, well actually I feel like I should get Dan drunk THEN talk to him...ha ha ha...If only. I dunno...he basically told me at a party a few weeks ago that it wasn't fair for me to tell him that I like him because he can't do anything about it. However if the rumours are to be believed then Dan and Kirsty are kind of on the rocks anyway!  But Steven is so so so freakin' hot!!!  arg. enough!

      Yesterday was definitely one of 'those' days.  You know the ones, where everything goes wrong.  I now need to find a new job, I quit because I couldn't be bothered anymore and when i told my boss that I was going to be leaving he got really angry because apparently "I'm leaving them in the busy period which puts them in the lurch" and told me not to come to him for a reference because I have just shown him that I am unreliable...good one Trev...I can't say I didn't always know that he was a bit of a twat.  However yesterday wasn't all bad - it was beautiful and all sunshiney, so after handing my keys back (I got becca to do it while I crouched down in the back of thecar - v classy!)we went and bought lots of alcohol then went and had an ace barbeque. We met becca's mums new boyfriend, and all got drunk and stuffed our faces...then went to the park and played lots of fun games...so I guess it wasn't all bad - although I had a bad feeling in my stomach all day and I only realised what it was this morning...  I haven't told my mum that I quit - so I'm going to have to pretend to go to work and that, to be honest makes me feel, well, like an idiot! But I can't tell her that I quit because she'll only be angry because she'll think that I'm not being serious about going to canada so basically I am screwed!  Last night was horrible too because we were out playing Badminton in the garden, and I had to act like I was having fun too, even though inside I was thinking "shit! what the fuck will I do?!"   Basically inbetween now and uni/canada I need to get a full time job...but doing what?!
