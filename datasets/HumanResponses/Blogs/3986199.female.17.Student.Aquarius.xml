      My dad had the maintenance guy come up to fix our a/c(then left me alone with the creepy fucker).We're not supposed to have cats,so I'm hoping none of our three little furballs(whom are all closed up in my dad's room)scratches at the door or meows anytime soon.It's making me nervous.

      Yeah, doing the whole waiting thing again. This time though, I have a time at which to just give up and go ahead and sleep. I was gonna go paintball tomorrow, but now it looks like we're gonna wait till monday because of the rain and all going on. We might still go tomorrow if it ain't raining around 11 or so, but more than likely it's gonna be monday sometime. Well anyways, I might be back a little later, right now I've got some tv to go watching. Yay! TV! Anyways, whatever, peace out yo. I'm just kididng, have a good time ok kiddos?

      Yay, it's late at night. Been waiting up for someone who I don't think will show, and I'm basically asleep in my chair. I'm in the middle of reading Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank, and I have&nbsp;to say it's damn good. The concept of the book is what the world would've been like in the 1970's-1980's had the Russians ever decided to nuke us, and the afteraffects of it in a small Florida town isolated in a contaminated zone that is set off from the rest of the country. I have to say that the book really brings out a lot of things that when you think about it would happen all at once. First, the complete and utter breakdown of everything civil in the world. The complete panic of people as they realize that the world they knew is now gone. Money has suddenly become worthless, and poeple rush out to buy things before any stores or dealers realize that anything anyone brings in is worthless except for trade. Like I mentioned ealier, I'm here waiting for Kristina to get on, but I'm not sure if she'll be getting on. She said she would be on around 10, and here I am an hour later falling asleep. Probably doesn't help that I haven't been getting enough sleep lately. Well, now I should be going cause I've got some eyelids that need some careful watching tonight.

      Well just woke up like an hour ago...lot of fun that was. Lord I don't think I've ever been more tired than that. Well anyways, last night was kinda interesting. I left and went to go and see about getting some sleep around 1. Of course, people felt the need to come downstairs and wake me up around 3 because the power went out and they couldn't get back on my computer. You know, there is a reason for me having it password protected and all, so don't even start with me on how important it is you get back on my computer. If I'm asleep, damnit leave me like that. Don't be going and waking me up just so that way you can get back on to talk to your girlfriend. You could always go home and just talk to her at your house. But no, of course you're here and always arguing with me about MY COMPUTER. Don't go telling me what I can and can't do on my own computer. Go home and mess with yours, my computer is my computer. You can't keep me from going and wanting to shut it down, or wanting to stop some programs just cause they're making the computer slow as hell. Just cause you want the program running doesn't mean that I do, so when I say it gets shut off, shut it off, don't argue with how important it is. I want it off. Deal with it. Some people.

      Alrighty people, here we are for the maiden voyage of this new blog area.&nbsp; Just wanting to say hey to you all out there who might one day be reading this, and wanted to say that hey, I hope you might decide to stick around for all the good things I'll have for you, stuff like parties, and cookies with ice cream and cake.  &nbsp; Well ok, maybe no parties, cookies, ice cream or cake, but I can still bring you a look into my mind, and what goes on in the life of a suburbian 14 year old who has nothing better to do with his time than sit here and type to all the people out there who know absolutly nothing about him.  &nbsp; Time for a little bit about me &nbsp; My names Chris, I'm 14, living in San Antonio. I go to William Howard Taft High. I have a small circle of friends, none of whom as of yet have decided to help share this blog with me. I know, I feel so sad. Anyways, I've got a girlfriend, named Kristina, who lives all the way in Sacramento, California. I know it sounds weird to have a long distance relationship like that, and that she's 17 and all, but you know what, deal with it ok?  &nbsp; Anyways, thats all for now, peace out yall.

      I think what I'm going to start doing is something along the lines of a once a week update, like update it every sunday or something. I don't know yet, or maybe even longer between updates. I don't really have alot to say about the past week. I went do DHOS yesterday, and it was lots of fun. Got some new anime, but the only problem is the only thing that can play them, my computer, is currently soundless. Quite the problem if you ask me. So here I am, 2 anime series, and no sound. I tried to use my mom's computer, but I'm not sure if that would work or not. I'll ask her about it later. Also, I'm one week closer to getting to see Kristina, which is a big plus. Come on time, start flying. I've got to wait until March or later, and it ain't fun. Anyways, maybe this next week will be full of cool, fun stuff that will happen to me, or it's gonna suck. I don't know yet, but time will tell. Also, anyone want to buy me a new cd player? Just wondering.

      Hey everybody, I haven't really posted anything in a while, of course it's not like it matters cause not a whole lot has really happened since I last decided to pester you people about my life. Let us see...ummm...I don't get to go paintball again till my birthday, which is september 15th for those of you keeping score, which kinda sucks. I guess on a good note my mom has agreed to buy me about $100 worth of stuff I've been wanting for my gun, which is pretty kick ass if you ask me. It's also been decided by my girlfriend that I'm gonna move to portland with her, her best friend, and her best friends boy. It's gonna make for some great fun don't you think? I guess my only problem would be how I'm gonna go about doing the whole high school thing you know. I kinda want to stay here till I finish high school, but I'm not sure when we're all gonna be moving out to portland. Hopefully I won't have to go through the trouble of having to get through my mom and everything about me wanting to withdraw from school here, move out and have a life a thousand miles from here. I think she'll pull the whole I'm only 15-16 thing and therefore since I'm not an adult I can't be able to make my own choices and I have to stay here until I'm 18. I guess there is one thing about moving away from here I'm really gonna miss, and that is Tex-mex. God I don't know if I could live without some home cooked fajitas, no real tacos, all the queso I could shake a stick at. Maybe I'll have my mom send me some food every month so that way I don't have to deal with the cheap imitation stuff that they'll have up there, seeing as I don't think any real mexican cooks can afford or want to live all the way up there, too far from the motherland and all. Well I guess I'm done for now, so I'll leave you all with this.  Don't eat plastic doughnuts. You wanna know why? Cause it just ain't a good idea is why, trust me.
