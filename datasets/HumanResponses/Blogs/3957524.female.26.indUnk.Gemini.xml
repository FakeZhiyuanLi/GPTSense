						   Shabbat is over, and WHOO HOOO for SHABBAT!!!!  I really missed Shabbat.  I really missed rest, I really missed shul, I really missed prayer.  And it was so amazing, that by deciding to bring this ONE Shabbat back into my life, little by little, I found comfort in today's prayers.  One comfort was in a prayer said  daily, the other from this week's parshah.    Rob and I haven't been able to find a shul in CT that suits both of us, so today we tried a new shul.  It turned out that it's not for us, the congregation, the attitude, and the style, but thats ok.  We'll find something....  I found my spirit there today.  The first thing that comforted me was in a prayer said on a daily basis, three times a day.  The last part of the silent Amidah.  I'm going to give the translation, as that's what I was reading this morning, and besides, my Hebrew isn't so good.   "... Open my heart to your Torah, so that I may pursue your mitzvot.  Frustrate the designs of those who plot evil against me.  Make nothing of their schemes.  Do so because of Your compassion, Your power, Your holiness, and Your Torah.  Answer my prayer for the deliverance of my people.  May the words of my mouth and the medidations of my heart be acceptable to you..."   And I was awestruck.  Words I had recited over and over for ages and ages, all the times I prayed the Amidah, suddenly the words came alight for me.  It's exactly what I have been feeling, open my heart to Torah, make nothing of all the things in my life pulling me away from my Judaism, give me the strength to pray and observe and be happy with my spirituality.  Accept my words of prayer and my heartfelt spirit.  And it was all right there in fromt of me all along.    And in the Sim Shalom prayerbook I was using, there was an alternate translation, which I have always ignored, never read it, but today I took the time to read it.     "...Grant me the privilege of the liberating joy of Shabbat, the privilege of truly tasting the delight of Shabbat.  May I be undisturbed by saddness, by sorrw, or by sighing during the holy hours of Shabbat.  FIll Your servant's heart with joy, for to You, oh Lrd, I offer my entire being.  Let me hear joy and jubilation.  Help me to expand the dimensions of all Shabbat delights.  Help me to extend the joy of Shabbat to the other days of the week, until I attain the goal of deep joy always.  Show me the path of light, the full joy of your Presence, th bliss of being close to You forever..."     And again, it was all right there in fromt of me, prayer to keep the joy of the Shabbat spirit with me, what I've been wanting in my recent life, what I've been missing.   And of that weren't enough, todays parsha was the second telling of the Ten Commandments.  Standing there, listening, I felt as if I were standing receiving them from Moses himself.  But it was when I was sitting and reading through the parsha, that I found this   "But if you search for the Lrd your Gd, you will find him, if only you will seek Him with all your heart and soul when you are in distress because all these things have befallen you and, in the end, return to the Lrd your Gd and obey Him.  For the Lrd your Gd is a compassionate Gd:  he will not fail you nor will He let you perish;  He will not forget the covenant which he made with you fathers..."   And I felt like some of my prayers were immediately answered.  All I have to do is pray, and look, and believe, and that lost spirit will be there for me.  I liked that.  A lot.    It didn't matter that the Rabbi was chacking his beeper, or that the person reading Torah wasn't actually reading from the Torah, but was reading from the chumash, and the congregation wasn't really my type...  none of it mattered.  Thats just one shul, I can find another, what matters is I found part of my answer, found some help and solace in one single shabbat service.    It made me feel that I can do it again, fit it all back into my life.  I'm not sure how, I'm not ready to quit the job I have, nor am I ready to tell my cousin,   sorry, I can't go to your engagement party  , or my friend   sorry I can't go to your wedding  , because it's on Saturday.  But I can start again with the little things: candles, reading, learning, prayer, Kosher....  I'll go to shul when I can, if not, I'll find a way to pray on my own.  I did it once, I can try again, and maybe one day I'll be able to find that job with Saturdays off.  For now, its ok, I'm doing my best.  I'm just glad I feel spirit again.  Rob commented on a previous post that Gd was closer to me than I thought.  He was right.  Thank you Rob.   After shul I took my Shabbat nap, and then Rob and I did our own thing the rest of the day.  It was a very nice Shabbat, a very meaningful Shabbat, and I am very thankful.

						   It's Friday and the evening is winding down, the sun will soon be setting.  Shabbat is upon us, the first Shabbat that I will have appreciated in a long time.  I am thankful for this opportunity to relax, pray, spend quality time with Rob, not worry about work, or anything, just spend time resting and being together.  Have taht quiet spiritual time that I so desperately need.  It's funny that you don't always appreciate the little things in life, I took my weekends for granted until half of them were gone.  Now I'm beyond excited to have a weekend off, and have no other obligations such that I can rest and relax and enjoy the Shabbat Spirit.    Shabbt Shalom everyone, I will post more when Shabbat is over.  Until then I wish you a peaceful, loving, and spiritual Shabbat.

						   Today is Friday and my weekend off is here!  YAY!!!!!  Today is Friday and tonight is Shabbat!!!!  DOUBLE YAY!!!  YAY!!!!  I'm just glad that I have a weekend, and I hope that I'll have a good weekend, as my weekends are so important to me.  Hopefully I'll be able to go to Shul this Shabbat, and if not, while disappointing, I plan to have Shabbat's spirit in my heart. To try to re-add some small thing in my journey back.  To enjoy Rob's company this weekend, spend time just relaxing together, being together.  So today is Friday, and I have to go to work now, but this morning I feel hopeful and spiritual.  I feel stronger going into my day, that I will have a good day, with Shabbat to look forward to tonight.  I wish everyone a good, peaceful and strong day as well.   WHOO HOO FOR FRIDAYS!!!!!

						   One of my patients was discharged today.    Well, you might think, you work in a hospital, one of your patients might be discharged EVERY DAY, and well how often do you REALLY see a patient more than once anyway?   And those are good points.  People are in and out of the Acute Care hospital all the time, patients I evaluate today are often gone tomorrow, if not sooner.  And I rarely see the same patient twice because I do evaluations a lot and often not so many treatments.    Well, my answer is this.  I work on the burn unit.  I am, for the most part, the primary therapist on the burn unit.  And because I am the primary therapist there, not only do I get to treat the patients I evaluate, but I also get to follow them through to  discharge to home or to rehab.  So I get to know a lot of my patients.  And when you have patients with large body surface area burns, you see them a few days a week for often months at a time before they go to rehab.  The particular patient I refer to, was a relatively young man, I believe, in his late 40's/early 50's.  You may have heard about him on the news.  He was homeless, and was sleeping behind a supermarket, when he woke up on fire, with kids laughing at him.  WOW, I thought when I first read the chart, how cruel can kids be....   And they NEVER found the kids/persons who did it to him...  Anyway, this happened in April.  He was burned over 60% of his body, was on the ventilator for ages, had enough surgeries for about 50 people, and was in the burn unit a looooooooooong time.  Its interesting to see the progression, when patients with those serious burns come in they're on  the ventilator for awhile, and you only worry about maintaining their ranges of motion, and then when they start to wake up and be able to get out of bed, you get to see their personalities and really get to know them as you follow their treatments.  And it's odd because you know about a period of their lives that they have no clue or memory of.  Anyway... I digress.  I do that a lot.  My patient was on the ventilator for awhile because of an inhalation injury, had tons of surgery and I really started to get to know the really great person he is when he woke up and I got to work with him on mobility.  And he was such a great guy, really personable, humorous, motivated, and just a genuinely nice guy.  And FINALLY in the beginning of July, I passed off to the rehab unit.  And when he was there, I got updates from the other therapists, and got to follow his progress and pop in and say hi from time to time.  And today he went home.  YAY!  Well, I'll miss him, but I'm so happy that he's done so well.      "Success of therapy is not measured in monetary gains, but in human spirit."    Its so rewarding to know the difference I made, the human spirit I passed, and it makes me love my job more.  This man was SO sick, had a SERIOUS injury and will be disfigured, and disabled for a long time, if not forever.  But he's leaving the hospital, going home to his parents home, walking, communicating, performing his activities of daily living, and happy, just to be able to breathe fresh air and eat home-made food, not hospital food.  The little things which he appreciates so much more.  And I'm happy for him.  And I just wanted to share, because this why I like therapy so much.  The spirit that was elicited in this therapist/patient relationship, the fact that I KNOW I made a difference in this mans life, and I KNOW how precious the small things that we take for granted in life are, and I KNOW I can change the little things that make BIG things happen.  If I didn't range his joints all those months, work on his initial mobility, get him up and moving, stretch his arms and legs, he wouldn't be walking today.  He wouldn't be going home in the healthy state he is in.  And I'm so proud to have made that difference.  A friend recently told me to "  Leave the world different from how you found it.  "  And what I do as a therapist, that spirit, helps create that difference in the world.  I love that.

						   Evening has come and I'm feeling a bit betterer.  I had my watercolors class tonight and somehow focusing on the painting made me feel calmer, and more peaceful.  I  worked on several versions of one painting which was fulfilling to see and fix it all, and there was some good give and take in the class, the professor helped me out more this time and I got a lot of good feedback  from him and from classmates on some of my technique.   I've never painted before but I seem to have a good feel for it.   Apparantly all I need with it is time to grow with the technique.  But I guess all anything needs to imporve is time.  And then I can sell my paintings for tousands of dollars each and I can pay off all my school loans!  WOO HOO!!!  Anyway....  Time made me feel better today.  Well, that and some food and water. :)  I did break the fast early becasue I was feeling ill, and I did have a full supper prior to sundown, but I feel better now that the day is done.  I feel a bit upset still about my spirit, but its better.    I'm glad I went to my class tonight, I wasn't going to but it really helped to calm my spirit.  And thank you Rob for your beautiful comments to my last post, I truly appreciate them, and I know I can just walk into the other room and hug you and tell you in person, But I wanted to share the semtiment with the world.  I love you as well.  Very much.    So, feeling betterer, I know I can do a little more soul searching for my balance in Judiasm.  I love Judaism, I love its practice and I love its spirit.  I WILL find it and fit it all back into my life again.  Thank you all for listening, for those of you in the internet world reading this.  Have a good night, and may your dreams be sweet. :)

						   Oh well...  So much for fasting.  I was doing pretty well.......    and then I almost fainted.  It was my own fault.  There's a reason that you're not supposed to shower on a fast day.  But I was feeling SO yucky, and so sweaty and dirty that I needed to.  I knew it was one of the things besides not eat that you weren't supposed to do.  But I figured I'd feel better afterwards.   I was wrong.  It made me feel worse, and I almost fainted in the shower.  But I came out ok, I turned off the water and sat down, opened the curtain and just sat until the feeling passed me.  And then I ate something because I was still feeling so shaky.  And I felt so much better after I ate. And I know you're not supposed to fast to the point of being ill.  But I feel guilty and bad.  So much for observance to feel more connected and to pray for easier observance.  Like the spirit I was looking for is saying HAH!  YOU CAN'T HAVE ME!!!    All I can say, and hope to feel is that I did my best, and my heart and spirit was, and still is in the right place and frame of mind that it was when I started this fast.   I still want to fix my observance, and find my spirit.  I couldn't make it through the fast but instead of meaning that maybe the spirit isn't out there, maybe it means that I just need to look a little bit harder.  I hope so.

						   Today is Tisha B'Av.  Tisha B'Av, is the ninth day of the month of Av.  It is a day of mourning to commemorate the tragedies that have happened on this date, most notabley the destruction of the First Temple in 586 BC, and Second Temple in 70 CE, in Jerusalem.    However, other tragedies have happened on this day...   In the year 1095 the First Crusade was declared by Pope Urban II. 10,000 Jews were killed in first month of Crusade. The Crusades brought death and destruction to thousands of Jews, thousands of non-Jews, and totally obliterated many communities in Rhineland and France.  In 1492 the Jews were expulsed from Spain as part of the Spanish Inquisition.  In 1914, Britian and France declared war on Germany starting the First World War. in 1942, Hitler started the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the deportation of Jews to the death camp Treblinka.  In 1989 Iraq walked out of talks with Kuwait.  And in 1994 the deadly bombing of the  AMIA building (the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina) killed 86 people and wounded some 300 others.  Tisha B'Av is the culmination of a three week period of mourning, and it is a fast day.  It is a 25 hour fast, one of only two on the Jewish calandar, the other being Yom Kippur.  So from sundown last night to sundown tonight, no food, no water, no brushing my teeth, no showering, no leather shoes.  Some people refrain from sitting on comfortable chairs and couches, they sleep on the floor, as one would in mourning.  All to mourn the loss of the temple.    And I believe in all of this, it is a meaningful day, I, as do many Jews, mourn the loss of the temple, and await the coming of Moshiach.  I'm not so sure how I feel about the whole animal sacrifice thing, but I do know that the world will be a much more peaceful, tolerant, happier place to live once Moshiach comes. I like that idea a lot, but that is another discussion for another day.   And when Moshiach comes, the Holy Temple will be rebuilt in Jerusalem.   And I've tried to think about how I feel about the subject, and I've done some reading.  One source basically said, that the Temple was one one place in the world where one could feel and see Gds presence and miracles.  And after its destruction, it became much harder to feel and see that presence.  Now, the small things, keeping Kosher, having Shabbat, lighting candles, going to shul, celebrating holidays,  all those little rituals give you Gds presence and spirit.  But that's hard in this modern world and so we should strive for those little Jewish miracles in our lives, and we on Tisha B'Av should mourn the loss of the ever present presence and ease in which it could be felt with the Holy Temple.    And I liked that.  Because thats how I've been feeling, that its SO HARD for me to keep my Jewishness and observe the rituals that at one point in my life seemed so easy. Now my life is different and there is working on Saturdays, Kashrut though not feeling it, not being able to go to shul as much as I want to, not celebrating holidays in the ways I used to or really want to.  These are all decisions and comprimises I've had to make.  I couldn't find a job where I could have Saturday's off.  So I comprimised, and said ok, I'll work Saturdays, so I could find a job.  And I love my job.  But i miss my saturdays.  I work every other weekend, and the Saturdays I'm off, there are so  many other things that need to be done, so i really don't get to shul.  I haven't been since Passover!  I keep a Kosher home, but it doesn't feel like it because I find it so hard to do anything else Jewish.  I feel guilty lighting candles on Friday night if I'm going to be working on Saturday.  I often feel as if that presence of Gd is eluding me in my day to day world, when it all used to be so much easier.    And so I fast.  I fast even though I'm hungry, and thirsty, and have a headache, and I'm not feeling as Jewish as I once did, and not really so happy about it.  I fast to mourn the tragedies of this day but I also fast for that lost spirit that I miss.  I pray to regain that spirit, that spirituality, that feeling and presence of Faith and Love and Gd.  Whether that be with the coming of Moshiach and the temple, or a resolution in my day to day observance, I hope that this fast brings about Peace and Spirit for me and for the world.

						   Weekend here! Well, sort of. I'm working this weekend. As you can see, because who gets up at 6AM on a Saturday to BLOG? I DO I DO!!! Although this Saturday feels more like Monday. I was off Thursday, and I was sick yesterday, so I had 2 days to sit around and sleep. Oh yeah and runnnnnn to the lavatory. I did pretty much 2 things yesterday, sleep and run. The sleep felt good, I feel betterer today. not perfect, but betterer.   BUT, Even though my tummy isn't feeling 100% I must go to work. One because I felt guilty enough taking one day off, not that I should have felt guilty, I needed to take the day, I wouldn't have been functional as a PT. But I DID leave the hopsital short ond a Friday, so I do feel a little bad, BAD TUMMY!!!  Two, and more importantly, this is the weekend, and if I don't show, there aren't many to cover for me, PLUS I'm doing scheduling today, and will PROBABLY carry the PT pager(unless someone else is DYING for it.) So if I don't go in there won't be a schedule, and there won't be any therapists to eval. all the patients I would have eval'ed yesterday, PLUS all the new patients for today! So today I will eat bagels and jello and drink tea and get through my day.   And I'll get through tomorrow and Monday so I can have off Tuesday to fast. (Tuesday is the 9th of Av)(More another time)  Although I must say, that while its stinky to get up on a weekend morning at 5:30 and lose you weekend to work, once you're actually IN the hospital, it's actually a pleasant day to work. The hospital is much quieter on the weekends. Yeah there are Dr's and Nurses there, but somehow fewer, and fewer therapists, case managers, administrative peoples, etc. You don't get squashed in the elevators on the weekend, you can go from the 8th floor to the 2nd floor directly and not stop at every floor in betweeen because people are too lazy to take the stairs one floor, DOWN ONE FLOOR!!! The cafeteria is quiet, there are usually less patients to be seen unless you're backed up from the week, the pager doesn't go off every 2 seconds, it's just plain quieter and you can get more patients seen, because it's quieter. Not so bad.   Anyways,  I hope all out there have pleasant weekends, and that your tummies are feeling well. For me, time for work! :)  PPPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!

						   Just got an email from the photo peoples at Snapfish , they posted my latest pictures!  I wanted to share a couple of my favorites from the hike Rob and I did at Killington Peak in VT about a month ago. It was a great hike, though the mountain KICKED MY REAR END!!!!    It was a really hard hike for me, but I perservered and kept going, and Rob was awesome, letting me hike at my own pace, not pushing me to go faster.  And the climb was worth it, the day was beautiful you could see for miles and miles due to the clear weather, the clouds were amazing, the whole view was amazing.  I don't think I've seen a view like that since I was on Massada in Israel.  I'm really glad that I didn't quit, and I kept going because that view was beyond worth all that pain.  I learned a lot about pushing my limits that day, and what you can achieve when you just slowly and steadily push instead of giving up and hiking back.  I would have missed the view of a lifetime.   As a hiker once wrote,  "Give your heart to the path, and beauty will come"   Now that quote can be used in multiple ways, but that day I trusted the path, I trusted the hike, I kept pushing forward, and I not only received beauty, but also wisdom in return.  So here are two of my favorite pictures.    urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     Rob and I at the top!  The guy who took the picture asked us where we wanted to stand to get the best view behind us.  My comment was just take the picture, wherever we stand there will be an amazing view!   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink      This one is of some of the clouds, The clouds were so beautiful that day.  More of them showed up as the day went on but mostly they were of the type that you might find on a child's bedroom ceiling.  Again, totally worth the climb to see that view.    Just wanted to share.  If you'd like to see more of the Killington pictures (I have a roll and  half of them) lemme know and I'll either post more or send you the Snapfish link.  ENJOY!

						   I am disliking my stomach right now.  I dislike tummyaches, and I dislike them when they make me feel unable to deal with daily life.  Unable to enjoy a friend's event, unable to spend time with family, or friends, unable to spend time with Rob, unable to go to work.   According to the doctor nothing is seriously wrong, so that's good, but it's frustrating to deal with when you're running off "you know where" so often.  And it comes and then goes away and feels better and then comes back again, with no regular pattern.  Sometimes it stays for days and weeks and sometimes it doesn't.    And today it kept me home from work.  I HATE THAT.  I hate feeling like I have to call in sick and I hate feeling so ureliable, but how can I treat patients in the hospital when I don't know when my stomach is going to tie itself in a knot?  What am I going to do tell an unsteady patient to wait here, just a minute, while I run off to the ladies room?  And I KNOW we're so short staffed, so I hate to leave them down a therapist, ESPECIALLY on a Friday which is ALWAYS the craziest day.  But here I am, sitting on my couch, stomach in a semi-knot, blogging, instead of stretching a burn patients ankles, or teaching an elderly lady not to leave the walker by the wall and then walk to the bed, because that's a great way to fall.  But I know this was the right thing for my body today, to let it clean itself out, and to rest, which I think it needed. But I feel a bit guilty.  I guess my perfectionism is showing through, my desire to be good at whatever I do go to work even though I may have a tummyache and not let anyone down.  But I'm working this weekend, and I guess I can do that then, work extra hard or something, despite what I may be feeling, because the patients in the hospital are, inarguably, feeling worse.  So if they can work with me to get out of bed, I can get myself out of the bathroom...  Well, out enough to walk a patient or two.  :)

						   In the hospital, patients wear hospital gowns.  In CT, they call them " Johnny Coat's ."  I've never heard of that before. And I've never found out where the name  "Johnny Coat"  came from.  I've always called it a hospital gown.  If anyone does know the origin of the Johnny Coat, I'd love to hear it.  ANYWAY, I digress...  As you all know, hospital gowns are famous, or infamous rather, for being WIDE OPEN in the back.  They do tie, but when in bed, it's usually easier to keep them untied so you don't get all twisted around and mummified in them, especially as moving around is often hard for my patients.    So, when I stand a patient up and take them for a walk, I always tie the back of the gown.  And often I joke with my patients that I'm tieing the gown closed,  "I don't want you to flash anyone."   Or I'll tell them " No free shows today ."  I've gotten some good responses.  One woman, as we were going out into the hallway asked if there were any men around.  Thinking she was concerned about being exposed, I looked and told her no one was there, and her gown was closed anyway.  Her response was  "Darn it!"    One guy told me that by closing the gown when he went in the hallway I was  "taking all the excitement out of life."     But my very favorite response was from a little 90-something year old lady.  I tied her gown and told her,  "No free shows today!"   Her response was,   "Yeah, because if I'm going to give anyone a show, I want to get paid for it!"    I was ROLLING.  It was so funny.  That's one of my favorite hospital stories.  Hope y'all enjoyed it!!  Have a good night!!

						   Neural What?  in the Lower What? in Patients with WHAT?!?!?!  Ok, lemme explain.  First, this was the title of the Master's Research Project that I did with 3 of my classmates, Nick, Bryan, and Gary.  That's us here the day we presented to our classmates and professors.      urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     Thats Bryan in the blue shirt, Gary behind me, and Nick on my other side.  I hope they wont mind me posting them on the net but with the good news I'm about to spill to the universe I don't think they'll care.  :)  Good guys, I really enjoyed working with them on this project.  Anyway so what in the world did we study?    "Neural Conduction Velocities in the Lower Extremity in Patients with Raynaud's Phenomenon"  Ok, so let's pick the title apart in English, not PTese.  The body has nerves, nerves "run on electricity" so to speak.  So a Neural Conduction Velocity is how fast a signal or current runs along a nerve.  So we studied the speed of the nerve currents in the leg in patients with Raynauds Phenomenon.  Rauynaud's Pnenomenon is a disorder that affects the extremities, hands feet, (fingers and toes), also ears and nose.  What happens is the blood vessels go into spasm when lets say the hand is exposed to a change in temperature, usually cold, and blood cant get to the fingers.  The hands turn white as the blood leaves, blue because not enough oxygen is getting to them, and then red when blood flow returns.  And this is a painful thing.  There are 2 types of Raynaud's Phenomenon.  Type1 is when it happens for no known reason, and Type 2 is when it happens as a result of another disorder.    So basically we studied how Raynaud's affects the speed of the nerves in the legs.  We tested the speed of the nerves with electrodes in patients with type 1 and 2 Raynaud's Phenomenon, and normal people.  And we found that Raynaud's affects the nerves.   It slows down the speed of the nerves in the leg, but not all of them only 2 of them, and not with both types of Raynaud"s.  And there is some clinical significance, and some chicken and egg theories, but I won't get into all of the details here.      Because.....    Why am I babbling about this here?

						   OH BABY!  A quickie!  Well I just wanted to say a quick Hello Hi to the internet world before I go to work.  I'm a sleepy Carie right now, but have no fear tomorrow I can take a break and sleep late.  Hope everyone out there is well, or anyone, for it doesn't seem anyone is reading my thoughts and days....  HELLO OUT THERE........  Anyway, have a good day all, I'll post more later. Time for Hospital stuff!  On a closing note, I'll leave you with a favorite thought of mine...  If I eat equal amounts of dark and white chocolate, is that a balanced diet?      Any thoughts??

						   Well, my Monday is pretty much over.  I thought this might be a good complement to this mornings post.  I had a pretty good day, actually.  Quiet at work.  I got there early to do scheduling, which, as we are perpetually short staffed, was minorly frustrating.  But I had mostly pleasant, easy going, non-rude patients today.  And the ones who may have been rude were too confused to really do any more harm than babble in a mix of Italian and Gibberish.  And the good part about getting to work a half hour early is that you get to leave a half hour early.  :)  So I got to come home, buy food, cook a bit, and relax.  And while others unforturnately may have worked something like a 17 hour day today, I think I had a pretty good one.  And the good part of it is though, that while I'm at work, it doesn't SEEM like I'm working.  I can't stand getting up int he mornings, but my day usually goes by pretty quickly.  I read a chart, make sure I have orders, see the patient, write it up and repeat the process.  And I get to meet a million different types of people.  Some of my patients can be annoying but some are pretty entertaining.  Before I know it it's lunchtime, and before I know it again, its time to go.  So that's good then.  When I was in High School, someone, (my hairdresser I think actually) told me the best piece of advice I think I've ever gotten.    "Choose a career where you will never have to work"  I like that.  Find something you love to do because, if you do it'll never be work.  I think I've found that, and I consider myself lucky.  WOO HOO FOR PT!!!!!!  So my Monday went by pretty quickly, and usually quick Mondays lead to quick weeks. (or 2 weeks) Tomorrow is Watercolors class, Wednesday is, as my sister says, "Humpday."  Thursday is off, and then there's the "non-weekend."  I hope all of you out there in internet land had a good weekend, and a good Monday, and I hope that you have a good week ahead.

						   Well, the weekend is over.  You might say, well, it'll be around next weekend, only 5 days away.  Well for me that would be 14 days.  And the last full weekend I was off before this one was actually 4 weeks away because I had to work July 4th, which of course fell on my weekend off.  I usually work every other weekend, the WHOLE weekend.  Which for me brings about so many thoughts and issues.   First there's the Shabbat thing.  I don't like working on Saturdays, I miss not having Shabbat, I miss not going to Shul.  But I couldn't find a job in the PT hospital world without having to work SOME Saturdays.  Well then I chose the job with the MOST Saturdays.  Not that I don't like my job.  I love the hosptial, love the people I'm working with, Love Acute Care, and I get days off during the week to make up for the weekends, but those every other weekends are just starting to wear on me.  And I miss Shabbat.  I feel out of touch with the rest of the  world.  I'm working when people are off and off when people are working.  So my weekdays off, while good for Doctor appointments, aren't good for seeing your friends who work a normal 40 hour work week with all weekends and holidays off.  I mean I live with Rob and I feel like we don't really get to spend time with each other, our schedules are so out of sync.  And why is it that every single weekend I'm working, the weather is perfect, and then it rains on my weekends and weekday comp. days off?  ANYWAY...  this wasn't meant to be a negative sounding post.....So what was my point before I started rambling about working weekends...  Oh yeah I was going to talk about my weekend off.  It was a good one.  Not the best, it had its goods and bads but mostly it was a good weekend.    Rob and I went to my cousin's engagement party.  it was actually a REALLY nice day Saturday, though hot, it was a nice relaxing day sitting in the backyard with family and friends, eating and talking etc.  It was nice.  Saturday morning before the party I spent time watercoloring, which was really relaxing.  And I got to get up later than 6AM!  (It's weird when 8:30 seems like sleeping late)  Suunday Rob and I went to NYC for the day, which didn't quite work out how we wanted it to. I think we sepnt more money yesterday doing nothing than we meant to...  We had brunch with a friend, but couldn't figure out what to do afterwards.  We tried the Planetarium and the Museum of Natural History but the lines were sooooo long so we just decided to go home.  The highlight of being in the city was sitting on the bench in the middle of Broadway deciding what to do, and this homeless man, comes by spouting things about kosher bagels and lox, and shelter, and how women like him because he smells so badly.  It was kinda funny, made us laugh, though if you look at the story thats probably behind the homelessmess its kinda sad.  The man was probably mentally ill, thrown out of a home/hospital, off his medications, etc.  It's so sad at the lives wasted like this...    So, with the lines to long at the Planetarium, and both Rob and I tired, we ended up coming home to CT, and relaxed the rest of the afternoon.  So it turned into a pleasant Sunday.   And today is Monday, and that was my weekend.  I'm very protective of my weekends, try to make them good ones.   I think I mostly succeeded.  Spent time with family, Spent time with Rob, Spent time with friends, Spent time sleeping, Spent time being creative.  :)  And so now it's Monday.  I'll be off Thursaday, work the weekend, and then off Monday, work the rest of next week, and in 14 days I'll have a weekend free again.    And so my life goes.   More later, for now it's time to get patients out of bed at the hospital.  :)

						   Ok, so I'm jumping on the bandwagon, I'm blogging.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Dunno exactly.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  1. Thought it might be fun.&nbsp;  2. It's a good way to know what's going on in other peoples lives that I may not speak to as often, if they update it&nbsp;that is.&nbsp;  And I'm feeling isolated a bit since I've moved to CT, I don't know anyone here really, and I miss my friends...&nbsp; Maybe this can get me back in touch more often or keep me in touch with everyone.  3. Rob started one, and I enjoy it.&nbsp; Adam has one and when he used to update it was nice to read.&nbsp; I've read other people's random blogs, that I've enjoyed.&nbsp;  4. I don't have tons much else to do.&nbsp;Maybe it'll be fun and entertaining.&nbsp; :)  5. Since my old, old, old website is old, old, old, and not updated and I can't find the password to it to either update it or delete it,&nbsp;I can create a new corner of the web for myself, all without knowing HTML.  6. It might be nice to keep track of my own thoughts and days to look back on.  7. Maybe I can meet people in that big ole internet void.  8. And the ultimate answer to any "Why?".....&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not?!?!?  &nbsp;  Well...&nbsp; I guess maybe I do know.&nbsp; :)  &nbsp;  Anyways, I hope y'all enjoy my BLOG.&nbsp; I'll try to update it as often as I can.&nbsp; :)  &nbsp;  Oh yeah and here's "Rob's Rabbet"&nbsp;in case anyone wants to read his stuff.&nbsp; :)   urlLink http://www.robwcole.blogspot.com/   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  And remember...&nbsp; SMILE!&nbsp; Your teeth need to breathe!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   What's wrong with me!?!?!?!  Adam and Laurie and Brad and Jackie and Allison and Tozar, and Anley and Jube all got married this summer.    My cousin Willie proposed to his girlfriend Allison and is getting married next July.  Daryl proposed to my cousin Marin and they're getting married the week before Willie and Allison.    Today I get an email from my friend Eric from college, whom I really have lost touch with these past couple of years, he just proposed to Melissa, another friend from college, and they're getting married in November!    I am so excited and happy for all of my friends and cousins!  I'm ecstatic for them to be taking this happy new step in their lives!  Everyone's getting married!!!! So what's wrong with me?!!?!?!  Maybe everything, maybe nothing.  I have a boyfriend, and I love him.  I want to marry him, but I am SO   NOT   READY to be married.  As a matter of fact I'm TERRIFIED of marriage.  I love Rob, I live with him, day to day life probably won't be that much different.  So why not just get married?  That's what people keep telling me.  For some reason it just seems so HUGE and pretty scary.  Like a step in life I'm not ready to take.    I've just taken so many new steps in life, graduated school, new job, "adult" independence.  I don't want to add marriage to that just yet.  But what's wrong with me that everyone else my age seems to be getting it all, and I'm scared?  Why is EVERYONE asking me,  So, when are you and Rob getting married?   Why are people expectantly expecting me to tell them I'm engaged when I say I want to tell them something.  Why did Rob's family tell him they needed to  talk  to him because he needed a  kick in the pants.   Why did he have to tell them that it's me who needs the kick in the pants.  We've been dating for almost 2 and a half years, we live together, we love each other.  Why can't I just be ready?  I WANT to get married, I want to have the wedding and celebrate and spend the rest of my life with Rob.  I love him very much.  But the concept of marriage is just scary right now.  I just don't get it.    Everyone's getting married!  So what's wrong with me?

						   Monday morning....  OY!  My 3 weekwnds in a row are over and I have to work this coming weekend.  Ah well, it was nice while it lasted...   But for now it's a rainy Monday morning, and I'm sleeeeeepy.  I went to bed reasonably early, but I woke up in the middle of the night, wide awake for over an hour, and now I'm sleepy when it's time to be up.  I hate it when that happens.   Watched the women's gymnastics last night.  Whoo Hoo for gymnastics!  :)  Still enjoying the Olympics. Tee Hee!!!  :)  Okey, off to work! Time to make patients get out of bed!   Have a good day all!    Carie :)

						   An Iranian Olympic athlete, a favorite to win the gold in Judo, withdrew from the competition because he refused to fight an Israeli.  He refused the honor of being an Olympian and a gold medal because he doesn't like Israel.    He reports  "Although I have trained for months and was in good shape I refused to fight my Israeli opponent to sympathize with the suffering of the people of Palestine and I do not feel upset at all."     But shouldn't the spirit of the Olympics supercede political views?  Shouldn't we learn from the warm reception that the American's and Iraqi's got during the ceremony, or from North and South Korea marching together, and planning to compete as one team in the next games?  With all their problems, they can come together for 2 weeks to compete as one Korea.  Thats pretty darn awesome.  I mean I KNOW the Middle East is rippled with antisemitism and hate and problems, and has been for generations and generations, and I KNOW that it won't all be fixed overnight or even in my lifetime, and I'm not in 100% support of the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, but I also feel that it's not ALL Israel's fault.  The Palestinian's and their leaders show fault also.  And NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, it is  NOT COOL  to blow up civilians on busses, or malls, etc.   Aren't the Olympics supposed to foster International Unity and Peace.  If this Iranian athlete couldn't push it all aside and in the spirit of the Olympics compete with the Israeli athlete, maybe it's a good thing he withdrew, he doesn't deserve to be an Olympian.  Besides the fact that it's attitudes like that which will keep the Middle East a continued "problem" area of the world.  And I say it again, maybe I just expect too much from people.  But it's still pretty sad to see the hate in the world, and the things it drives people to do.

						   The Olympics have started!!  YAY!!!  I am an Olympics junkie.  I love watching, and following everything, even sports that I don't usually follow.  But I always think that it's amazing to see any sport played at that level.  My favorites are swimming (Including synchronized and diving), and gymnastics,  But I'll watch everything, volleyball, track stuff, soccer, fencing, everything,  I just love the Olympics.  :)  Today i was watching the swimming, Michael Phelps won the 400 meter Individual Medley.  I love the IM, it's a difficult, but great race to swim, and it's fun to watch.  :)  And YAY for Michael Phelps!  :)  And the Other USA competetor, I forgot his name won the silver!  I'm not feeling so amazingly patriotic right now as I can't stand my president, and how he's running/ruining the country, but that's another story for another day, and I feel that the Olympics supercedes all that.  GO USA!!  :)  Rob and I watched the Opening Ceremonies last night.  It was pretty cool.  I love watching the parade of nations, to see all the athletes walk into the stadium, calebrating their accomplishments.  There were some countries that I've never heard of, but thats ok.  I love watching the parade of nations because I feel like for so many of the athletes there, THIS is their Olympic moment.  So many aren't there to win, most live in small countries, sending small delegations, without huge and well funded Olympic programs.  So to march into the stadium, wave their nations flag, and be proud of their accomplishments and that they get to represent their country is such an amazing honor and great moment.  THAT'S what the Olympics are all about.  I love to watch the joy on their faces, watch them celebrate and wave and enjoy and even have their own cameras to record their moment of joy.   Rob disagrees with me, he  urlLink BLOGged , today that he thinks people should walk in orderly, with dignity and concentration and solemnity.  I disagree.  There are other times for order and steely faces. The opening ceremonies isn't it.  I love the Olympics and I love the celebration of International sport.  Lots of nations don't like the USA now, hell, I PERSONALLY don't like the USA now.  But the crowd gave the athletes a warm welcome.  They gave the Iraqi's a warmer welcome.  People recognize the difference between a country and its leaders stupidity, and it's citizens and athletes.  The Olympics is a time for fun and games and competition, so that the world may foster a friendly international community.  I love that.  And I love watching it all.  :)  YAY for the Olympics!  I will be glued to my TV as much as possible to watch the games.  After all, it only happens every 4 years.  WHOO HOO for the Olympics!!!  :) :) :) :) :)  .

						   Why are the people out there such bad drivers?  I thought New York drivers were bad, but it's pretty bad in CT too, hmmm, maybe people are just bad everywhere.    On I95 on my commute people are CRAZY!  They fly by me at like 90 mph.  I think 70ish is fast....  Or they rush to pass me only to get caught between me and the person in front of me, of whom I CAN'T go faster then...  So it becomes a whole rush and pass and waste of gas and potential accident with tight merges and speed, all to be 50 feet ahead of where you were.  One time I was in the left lane trying to pass someone in the middle lane who was not just too slow, but too variant, and I felt more comfortable being in from of him.  So when I tried to pass him, he wouldn't let me, I was going 72ish, and having trouble passing the guy, because he sped up not to let me.  THEN, this guy comes up behind me at breakneck speed, flashing his brights, riding my tail, throwing his hands up in the air, FLIPPING out because 72ish wasn't fast enough for him.  Normally, I would have just gotten over and let him pass, but I was neck and neck with the guy in the middle lane who wouldn't let me pass him, so I had nowhere to go.  So the Royal Jerk behind me pulls over all the way to the right lane, passes the middle guy on the right, comes all the way back to the left lane, gets in front of me, and then slams on his brakes to 55.  If my reaction wasn't so quick, I would have hit him.  And then he stuck his hand out the sunroof, gave me the finger and sped away.  Now let me ask you, what did all that accomplish?  He got ONE car length in front of me.  And in his anger to "get back at me" he almost caused an accident.    Monday, I was on Northern Blvd. On the Queens/Nassau border on the way home from my ENT appointment.  It was rush hour and CROWDED!  I was at this light, and it had recently turned green, and all the cars had sped forward and ended up blocking the intersection because they couldn't go any further because of the traffic.  I refuse to do that.  I  HATE getting caught in the intersection when the light turns red again.  One, it's dangerous, two it just causes more traffic.  So I wait.  And the lady behind me is PISSED.  She's BLOWING her horn and BLOWING her horn and BLOWING her horn, practically sitting on it, waving her arms, screaming at me, practically having a HEART ATTACK because I wasn't going to get caught in the middle on a red light.  She didn't want to miss the green, and she was too impatient to wait for another red.  Meanwhile, I went when there was space for me to make it through the intersection, she rode my tail the whole way, and we both made that green light.  Now she FLIPPED out, all to maybe be up a few hundred feet from where she was if she missed the light, and she ended up in the exact same place she would have ended up if I had gone forwards when she wanted me to.  But I wasn't going to take that chance of getting caught...    I think people like her piss me off more than the speed demon above.  It's those people who are in such a stupid rush in traffic that they weave and cause accidents and make traffic worse, or they move into entrance ramps because they see "another lane" and then create more of a merge, and more traffic, all to get MAYBE one car length ahead.  Now someone please tell me; what's the point of the rush??????  And is it possible to eradicate these speed demons and heart attack rushers from the roads so we can all just have pleasant rides to where we are going??  Somehow thought, I doubt there's an answer, or a solution to either question...

						   I went for my second opinion today with my Mom's ENT.  Well, not her personal ENT because he's on vacation, but one of his partners.  He basically told me what the other guy told me only muuuuuch betterer.    I have those tonsil stone things, they're called tonsoliths.  And my tonsils aren't cleaning themselves out well, and theta why they have white bumpies.  So all that's the same.  But he did a strep culture which is negative, AND he said I don't need my tonsils out.   THANK GOODNESS!!!   He said he RARELY takes adult tonsils out unless its absolutely necessary, because it's REALLY painful for an adult, they don't bounce back as easy as kids.  So he said it IS an option, but one not worth doing at all.  Not unless I'm in tons of pain all the time and I can't swallow, and I can't breathe etc.  He told me to rinse and gargle with half water half hydrogen peroxide, and gargle with just water after eating.  And he said that should clean them out.  And he told me not to take the antibiotics, because I don't have an infection, so why take antibiotics, ESPECIALLY, so much antibiotics.  AND he recommended an ENT in CT, a competent one.   I mean, the other guy was practically ready to schedule me for surgery, he gave me unnecessary antibiotics (this is how we get bacterial resistance...) and he barely even looked at me.  This guy was really nice, really explanatory, he looked at my nose, my ears, my throat, he took a strep culture, he even looked down my throat through my nose with this light thing..  That was SO UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!  Now I know partly how my patients with nasogastric tubes feel.  But he was thorough and have me a competent answer instead of telling me to live with it or have my tonsils out.    So I feel betterer.    Ok, off to bed, Sleepy for me, and my 3 day weekend is over, time to go back to work tomorrow, it seems like FOREVER!!! WHOO HOO for good ENT's!!  WHOO HOO for not needing my tonsils out!!!!!  Nite nite everyone!

						   People can surprise you.  Not necessarily in their beliefs, but in their actions.  I am always surprised at rudeness and racism.  I just don't understand it.  Maybe I'm just wired differently from so many others, but I don't understand why some people have such a hatred for other people.  And how they can be so rude.  I just don't get it.   As you may have read in a previous entry, I attended my friend Anley's wedding this weekend.  And as you may have read, Anley's family is from India, and she had a very large wedding, over 700 people were there.  And it was a very culturally different experience for me.  Anley had her wedding at Villa Lombardi's in Ronkonkama on Long Island.  And it was a BEAUTIFUL facility, the hall was beautiful, the food was excellent, the grounds were beautiful, and most of the service was pleasant, and wonderful.  The reason I say most of the service is because there was one member of the staff who did not fit into that beautiful, wonderful setting.  She was the lady who worked in the bathroom.    This lady was older, I'm not sure how old, but definitely a senior citizen, Probably in her 60's.  She was mean, rude, crotchety, racist, bitter, and disgusting.  All throughout the reception, if you went to the bathroom, she made rude, snide, racist comments.  "By the time they lift up their outfits, the party will be over"  "If you take that shawl thing off your outfit might be beautiful"  "These people have been giving me such trouble, messy and disgusting they are"  "I'm slaving to keep this bathroom clean for them and they don't even say thank you, they just make a bigger mess"  Some of the toilets were difficult to flush, because the push button was hard to press.  I had difficulty with it.  One older lady asked me as she came out of the stall how to flush the toilet, she couldn't do it.  I told her the button was hard to press you just need to press it hard.  So the rude lady, came over and nastily said to the woman "I'll just do it, I've been flushing toilets for you people all day, once more won't hurt"  Then she turned to me and said "I can't believe these people can't even flush a toilet, they've been so rude all day, and such mess, without even a thank you."  Well ya know what, if I had been treated like that I wouldn't have offered her a thank you either.  Although, I saw no reason for this woman to be so resentful, no one was rude to her.  For me, as one of the very few Caucasian persons at this affair, she was perfectly nice to me, but rude to Madhavi, when we, as women do, go to the bathroom together.  She was rude as I saw it to almost all of the wedding guests.    Now, I know that this was a large reception, and it may have been overwhelming for this one bathroom worker, but as far as I could see, no guest was overly rude, no guest made a huge mess, there was no more mess than at any other reception I'd ever been to.  No paper towels were left around, nothing was thrown on the floor, the sinks weren't even very wet and splashed.  Everyone was polite, yet appalled at this lady's behavior.  This is her job, to clean the bathroom at events like these.  If she doesn't like it then she shouldn't do it.  The facility is able to handle parties of this scale, if not they would not accept the reception, so you would figure that she must on some level be used to large parties.  I did not see any reason for her to be rude to the guests, this was someone's wedding and her family should be able to enjoy the reception and go to the bathroom without any negativity.  If this lady wants to be a racist, as much as I disagree with that, I guess she has the right to believe what she wants.  But if she is going to be working at a banquet facility, she should learn to leave her personal feelings at the door and just do her job.   As far as I'm concerned, there was absolutely zero excuse for her rudeness, comments and bad attitude.  Like I said before, maybe I'm wired differently, but I just don't understand rudeness for the sole reason of difference.  But maybe I just expect too much from people.

						     Somebody get the flowers, somebody get a ring. Somebody get the preacher and the choir to sing. Somebody get an organ to play. 'Cause somebody's getting married today! ......Because you share a love so Biiiiig, I now pronounce you Frog and Piiiiiig!!!    Hmmmm, can you guess that my weekend was full of wedding stuff?Not mine though, I am NOT ready yet for getting married.  But I am perfectly happy to be super excited about others...  This weekend it was Anley's wedding and Marin's engagement party.  Saturday I went to Anley's wedding.  Anley was one of my close friends from PT school.  And I got to go to her wedding!  YAY!  And I got to see Madhavi and Po!  YAY!  And the wedding was BEAUTIFUL, and Anley was a RADIANT Bride.  She just looked so amazing and happy and well, just radiant!  And I was SO HAPPY for her to be married, she just deserves all the happiness in the world, and it was a truly wonderful day to share with her.  I was pretty giddy the whole day in my excitement and joy.  The wedding was an interesting cultural experience.  For a multitude of reasons.  Anley's family is from India, so there were many Indian cultural aspects that were really interesting and wonderful to see.  My favorite, though it may seem superficial, was the dress.  At most weddings you go to you see men in suits, and women in formal (usually black) dresses.  At this wedding there were still men in suits, but there were also men in traditional Indian garb, and almost all of the women were wearing Sari's and other Indian formal dress.  And it was SO COLORFUL!  And SO BEAUTIFUL!!!  Anley had her white dress for the ceremony, but halfway through the reception she changed into a BEAUTIFUL Sari, and she just looked more radiant than ever.    It was such a wonderful occasion, over 700 people were there.  Which I couldn't fathom.  It was so huge.  I couldn't even begin to think how far I would have to stretch to think of even HALF that many people that I would invite to my wedding.    The other cultural shocking thing to me was the style of the wedding, not because of Indian tradition, but because of Christian tradition.  And I'm a little embarrassed to say so, that it was shocking, and amazing, and kinda out of my comfort zone. Because I am a very spiritual person, and while I have my issues with keeping up with my day to day practice, mostly I have great faith in Judaism, and cherish it greatly in my life.  Anley, and Jube, her new husband, and family, have similar faith, if not moreso, in Christianity.  And that's wonderful.  I may not agree with some of the beliefs, as I have my own, but always I respect and honor someone's faith, as I believe that faith can be a very individual and personal thing and no one has the right to infringe on someone's faith.  I guess I just had a bit of culture shock at this wedding.  There was a lot of prayer and blessings, and praises to Jesus, and readings from scripture, along with the stories, and praises, and toasts to the bride and groom.    Plus, while I always knew that Anley was very religious and very involved with her church and her faith, she never talked about it at length with me, and she never was one to speak of Christianity and her faith and belief and practice on a regular basis at school... During all those long hours we spent together every day for 3 years, she didn't mention many of these specifics ever.  So to see this side of her, and to hear from her family members, and community members of how she is a pillar of faith, and how she has so much belief and faith, and that she is envied by her community as a Christian role model, it was very new for me.  I knew this about Anley, but I had never seen it.  And I guess often you think of things, and know they are there, but it's still somewhat amazing for you to actually see them.  And while this by far is not a bad think to know and see about my friend, it was again, just a new experience.   There was no dancing at the wedding, not because there wasn't joy, but I am assuming because of the conservative faithfulness of Anley and her family and their devotion to their religion.  That to me is kinda odd.  It seemed weird to go to a wedding and not do a Hora, let alone no dancing the entire wedding.  It was just a really nice dinner with stories and presentations and prayer for the bride and groom.   And it was beautiful and nice, I guess I just had a culture shock and while I had a wonderful and fun time, some of the foreignness of the religious practice was somewhat uncomfortable for me to be surrounded with for a whole day.    So while I had an amazing, fun, beautiful time, and while I was and am overjoyed for Anley and her marriage, and I wish her all the mazel and happiness there is in the world for the rest of forever, there was a lot of new stuff, and learning for me which well, I guess was a bit overwhelming.      SO if Saturday was a wedding, Today was an engagement party.  YAY!  For my Cousin Marin, YAY!!  So I got to see all my family from my Dad's side, and we celebrated Marin and Daryl's engagement.WHOO HOO!!!!  :)  We went to this restaurant in Rockland, and it was a bit crowded with so many people in a small room, but it was fun to see family and friends, some of whom I haven't seen in awhile.  And we talked, and were happy and merry and celebratory in anticipation of a wedding, where I guarantee, there WILL be a Hora.  :)  On a side note, Hora's are fun.  I like Hora's, and Israeli dancing, and all the craziness, and breathlessness, and funness that goes into a Hora.  There was a HUGE long Hora at Adam and Laurie's wedding, it was fun, even though I had a stomachache. (DARN IBS!!!)  When I get married, I want the Hora to last at LEAST an hour... and then start up again later on in the reception.  To me a Hora just brings out the happiness and spirit and is so celebratory, EVERYONE dances the Hora.  Those who dance, those who don't dance, young, old, everyone.  Old ladies throw away their walkers and canes, men with aching joints jump out of their chairs, and its like Jewish medicine better than chicken soup.  Everyone circles, and swirls, and its just fin and happy and awesome.  I could write a whole BLOG on the joys of the Hora.  But, another time...  This BLOG is long enough.  Anyways, so that rounds up my wedding weekend.  I've been singing the wedding song from  The Muppets Take Manhattan  all weekend.    Somebody, Somebody, Somebody, Soooomebodyyyy.... Somebody's Getting Marieeeeeeeeed, Todaaaaaaaay!!!!

						   Why can't my body be normal?  If it isn't my stomach, it's something else, my feet, fatigue, and now my tonsils....  My allergies have been bad this season, and my throat has been REALLY itchy.  And my tonsils are the size of China.  I thought it was from my allergies, and so did my doctor, so we switched my allergy medication.  But my insurance company will only pay for 2 allergy medications.  Allegra, and Clarinex.  Allegra wasn't working, and they wouldn't pay for the Zyrtec, which is what the MD wanted me to take.  So we tried the Clarinex.  Never mind that my co-pay of the stinking medicine which I'm only on because its the only one that they'll pay for is $30.  (and I thought I had GOOD insurance!) But my tonsils haven't gone down, and now one of them is looking kinda funny.    For those of you with weak stomachs, please skip the next 2 sentences with the description of my tonsil.  Oh yeah and don't click on the link either.  Large, and kinda bumpy shaped, with white areas, kind of like whiteheads on my tonsil.  urlLink Here's a link to a picture of what my left tonsil looks like, though only about half as bad   And it's been that way for awhile, a month or more at least.  And now my throat feels swollen when I swallow, and not sore throat pain, but swollen when I swallow pain.    So, I figured I should finally get it checked out right?  See an ENT.  So I tried to make an appointment with the ENT recommended by some of my co-workers, and they can't give me an appointment for 3 weeks.  I don't really want to wait that long.  So I call another ENT on my plan and get an appointment for the next day.  (This was all yesterday) So I go to see him today, and he tells me that my tonsils, as all do, have crypts in them, which catch particles etc. to protect the body.  That's what tonsils do.  Well, my tonsils aren't cleaning those crypts out very well, and its all staying there creating those white bumpy areas, and creating my sore throat.  And, of course, with my recent luck...  the only choice is to have my tonsils out.    Kinda drastic don't you think???  He said the size of the crypts, suggest that I've had tonsil problems in the past without even knowing it...  I don't like the idea of rushing to have my tonsils taken out.  First of all who wants to rush into surgery, no matter how minor and common.  Second, your tonsils are there for a reason, they play a part in your immune system, keeping the bad junk from getting into your body through your mouth, like armed guards at the palace gates.  :)  Besides that, if I had the surgery, I'd need to take at least two weeks off from work, and that's a LONG time.  Normal time is a week with a total of 2-3 weeks with no strenuous activity.  But I'm all over the hospital lifting patients etc all day, so I'd need to be off all that time.    The ENT guy said he can give me an antibiotic, but usually this kind of thing is recurrent, and it'll come back.  So he gave me a large dosage of amoxycillin (875mg twice a day) for 3 weeks, and told me to come back in 6 weeks.  But that's A LOT of antibiotics, I HATE taking antibiotics, even when I really need to, and ESPECIALLY when it may not even help.  And with all the tummy ploblems I've been having, that can be irritating.    So now I'm angry and frustrated, I'm going to my mom's ENT Monday for a second opinion.  I'm going to wait on the antibiotics until I speak to him.  I'm just angry that the options are so limited, surgery or just live with it.  GGGGGGGGGRRRRRRR........  I don't know what to do....  Why can't there be another option?!?!??  Why can't my body be normal and healthy???  Anyway, in my internet search for information, I found  urlLink this picture   It's rather racy/gross depending on how you look at it, but I found it funny.  I thought it may lighten the load of the post while still staying on topic.  Although I'm still frustrated....  I don't want surgery, but I don't want a chronic swollen, sore throat either....   AAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!

						   About two centuries ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave Italy.  Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community.  So the Pope made a deal.  He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community.  If the Jew won, the Jews could stay.  If the Pope won, the Jews would leave.   The Jews realised that they had no choice.  So they picked a middle-aged man named Moishe to represent them.  Moishe asked for one addition to the debate.  To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk.  The pope agreed.   The day of the great debate came.  Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger.  The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head.  Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat.  The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple.  The Pope stood up and said, "I give up.  This man is too good.  The Jews can stay."   An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened.  The Pope said: "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity.  He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one Gd common to both our religions.  Then I waved my finger around me to show him that Gd was all around us.  He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that Gd was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that Gd absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin.  He had an answer for everything.  What could I do?"   Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe.  "What happened?" they asked.  "Well," said Moishe, "First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving.  Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews.  I let him know that we were staying right here." "And then?" asked a woman."I don't know," said Moishe. "He took out his lunch and I took out mine."

						   Why?  Well, Hmmmmmm...  The reason I can come up with isn't such a great one in my opinion.  Because I am a vegetarian.  I like to cook, but I find it hard to cook tofu without putting it in a pan with veggies.  It's not like I can really put a piece of tofu on a plate with a side of potatoes and a vegetable like a piece of chicken, or steak.  Tofu is pretty bland on its own, not very appetizing.  It takes on the flavor of that which you cook it with, and well, putting it in a pan with veggies and spices is the best way that I've found to infuse flavor into tofu.  Plus, it's EASY to do, you can put ANYTHING random that you have in the pan, and you ALWAYS get something different.  I rarely make the same thing twice unless it is super liked.    Not that tofu is the only thing I eat for protein.  I eat a lot of beans, and I like those veggie crumbles. (Not because they taste like chop meat, but because they taste like veggie crumbles, and have their own pleasing flavor, and also because they are so versatile.  Eggs, and dairy are fine with me, and I eat have those veggie slices things which I enjoy cut up in salads.  Also, I will sometimes eat fish depending on the type of fish and my mood.  My vegetarianism has little to do with animal rights, or feeling bad about eating animals or anything like that.  It has to do partly with likes and dislikes, and mostly to do with sensation.    I don't eat meat because I don't like it, the same way I don't eat peas, or yams, or bananas because I don't like peas or yams or bananas.  The sensation thing comes in because I find meat to be too tough, too heavy, too chewy, toooooo, meaty.  It's just plain uncomfortable, the texture, the feel, it's not pleasing to me, and I never liked the way I felt it lay in my stomach.  So with fish for example, I like salmon, or sole, or tuna salad, but I won't eat a tuna steak because it's too much like meat.  Another example with sensation for me is I don't like it when textures don't match taste.  I don't like sweet kugel because noodles are not supposed to be sweet.  The taste and texture don't match in my head, so its undesirable for me.  Yes, I know I'm strange.  And once again, I digress from my initial conversation, stir-frys.  So when I cook, I make almost everything in a stir-fry.  Tofu, crumbles, beans, veggies, starch, almost everything.  It's quick and easy and always different.  Today was no different.  Roasted asparagus, tofu, pasta, garlic, onions, and spices with a little olive oil all went into my favorite dish, my stir-fry pan.  YUMMY!!!  A few days ago, it was peppers, tomatoes, onions, crumbles and tomato sauce served over whole wheat spaghetti.  Before that it was black beans with rice, and onions and spices.  Or how about tofu, rice, garlic, spinach, broccoli and teryiaki sauce.  And I see you get the picture.    And while I love my stir-frys, I wonder if there's a vegetarian world out there that doesn't include the frying pan.  If I can learn to make tofu, or beans, or anything really with a baking pan and an oven, or a pot of boiling water, or a stew, or a soup.  (I do make a kick bootie veggie chili though!)  I'm sure the recipe's are out there, I just don't know them.    Any suggestions?  Any recipe's?  I love my stir-frys, I love being a stir-fry queen, but I like variety, and I'm always looking for new stuff to try.  Lemme know if you have a recipe.  I'd love to try it out.
