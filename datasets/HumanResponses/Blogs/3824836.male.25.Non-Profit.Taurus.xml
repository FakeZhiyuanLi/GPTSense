      so i've been a bit lazy lately and haven't motivated myself to add to this blog....&nbsp;&nbsp;i am going to make a very strong effort to turn that trend around NOW.   a quick summary of things that have happened in my life since the last posting...   1.&nbsp; closed a three week run of a musical in the north suburbs, made some great friends and enjoyed the process thoroughly.   2.&nbsp; continued rehearsal and tech week for a dance show (this weekend) in Oak Park with the company that i perform with&nbsp;out there.   3.&nbsp; many, many meetings at work as i begin to get ready for my first real vacation in almost 2 years!   4.&nbsp; my ex-girlfriend and her sister came and stole the kitchen table that her family had loaned to me while we were still dating, since they are moving into their own place and need the furniture.   tomorrow marks the 2 week countdown to my departure.&nbsp; i am excited.

      I live just down Clark from Wrigley Field with Chris my awesome flat-mate (much better word, because who actually shares a bedroom anyway). Chris and I met early in grade school and became good friends the summer before 5th grade and best friends by high school.&nbsp; We went to different schools - I to UofI (Illinois) and he to an other I school in a state just to our west.&nbsp;   I thoroughly enjoy living with Chris.&nbsp; It's one of those things where I never *dread* coming home to someone else being in my apartment... in fact, most of the time it's much more interesting if he's there.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I like having the place to myself, but he's just a great guy that's a lot of fun to be around.

      i find it ever so amusing when people ask "WHEN are you celebrating the fourth?" because "the fourth" has become synonymous with "independence day."  really, to celebrate "the fourth" you should git-down (as it were) on the 4th, right?  okay, enough - as with any long weekend, i tried to take some time to sit and think... usually on these weekends the "time to think" happens during the period known to some as R.E.M. sleep.  it's amazing how weekends (particularly holiday weekends) have a tendency to fly by - usually faster and with accomplishing less - because of the notion that since there's an extra day, one can get things done later... and, of course, all of a sudden "later" becomes the sometime during the next week or weekend.  alright, apologies about the tangent - but the "time to think" this weekend actually took place on the Tuesday afternoon drive from work.  so as i drove out to rehearsal i thought about independence... and interdependence... and how really despite all our feelings of self-determination and independence we are so completely dependent on those around us both on an individual level and moving all the way up to nations at a global level.  yeah, maybe i'm getting obnoxiously metaphysical here, something about interpersonal connections and the idea of humanity... but this is what was meandering about in my head.  no breakthroughs of enlightenment though.  just something i wonder about... for more thought later... during R.E.M. sleep perhaps.

      so here are 10 basic things about me...  just off the top of my head and in no particular order.   1. i was born in Virginia, but raised in Oak Park, IL - where i attended grade school, junior high and high school.   2. i moved downstate for a few years to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and graduated with a degree in Broadcast Journalism.   3. i did mostly nothing with my actual degree, but have found a successful position fundraising for a large Chicago cultural institution.   4. i have a younger sister, that most think is older.   5. my parents are married... still - almost 28 years.   6. i'm not really a pet-person.   7. beyond my job, the other committment that takes most of my time and effort is dance.   8. my favorite color is blue... no, red... no, blue.   9. i love new york city... but i love chicago more.   10. oh yes, and i've dated both women and men.

      after months of addiction to a certain chicago "left of center" blog - and a fast downward spiral into blog-dom over the past few days, i've decided to join the ranks of the world wide webloggers.  as with most blogs its not because i necessarily have anything all that important to say, it really because i've developed the desire to keep a journal of thoughts and experiences... and maybe amuse some people along the way.  honestly, i don't know how this will go or if anyone will pay attention or care - but basically, why the hell not.  as the title says - seize the day!
