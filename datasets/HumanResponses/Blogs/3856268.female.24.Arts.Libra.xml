      Athens The total bill for security at the Olympic Games will exceed $1.5 billion, Greek officials said this week. The installation of 1,400 surveillance cameras alone, a small part of the planned security measures, is costing $320 million—nearly the entire cost of protecting the 2000 Summer Olympics, in Sydney. A blimp carrying chemical-detection equipment and high-resolution cameras will float over the city during the events, at a price tag of $2.4 million. NATO will provide air and sea patrols, and U.S. special forces troops will guard the athletes’ training grounds on the island of Crete.   urlLink The Week

       COUNTRY MUSIC LOWERS YOUR KID'S IQ!   By DENNISD'ANTONIO  NEW BEDFORD, Mass. - Young children exposed to country music score lower on IQ tests than kids raised on rock 'n' roll, declares controversial music professor Dr. Roger Solett - and he bases his startling claim on the results of a study of 1,000 kids! "Country music makes kids stupid," he said. "It's the mind- warping lyrics." And he cited a few examples drawn from what he called "some of the most popular country songs of the past two decades." On the list: "I'd Rather Have a Bottle in Front of Me Than a Frontal Lobotomy." "Get Your Tongue Outta My Mouth 'Cause I'm Kissin' You Goodbye." "If You Wanna Keep Your Beer Cold, Put It Next to My Ex-wife's Heart." Dr. Solett is the former director of the prestigious Chopin Symphony and a professor of music. He said he and his research team gave IQ tests to 500 6-year-olds whose parents played country music in the house or car daily. "They're Billy Ray Cyrus, Faith Hill, Clint Black, Randy Travis, Garth Brooks fans - and their children scored, on average, 10 points lower on standard IQ tests than 500 6-year-olds whose parents are rock 'n' roll junkies," said Dr. Solett. "Now what's the difference between rock and country? It's just wild people banging on drums and strumming guitars in both cases. Lots of howling. Lots of noise. The only difference between rock and country is that country is stupid - the lyrics, I mean. " 'I wanna whip your cow . . . I fell on a pile of you and got love all over me . . . Drop-kick me, Jesus, through the goalposts of life' . . . I mean, c'mon, this kinda stuff'll warp your mind." But Dr. Solett's controversial study, and particularly his views, are not shared by many, if any, of his peers. And a member of his own research team, who asked to remain anonymous, told Weekly World News, "He hates hick music with a passion."

      FLY THE UN-FRIENDLY SKIES Coffee, tea or jihad, sir?  By BERNIE PYLE  &nbsp;TERRORISTS have formed their own airline -- because they're afraid of getting on a plane that could be hijacked by other terrorists! That's the incredible claim made by Amir Humad, a Saudi terrorist who was recently captured and is being held in a top-secret location. "No one's going to hijack a plane when everyone else on the plane is a crazed terrorist," Humad says. "Sure, terrorists are crazy, but we're not crazy enough to get on a plane that might be hijacked." Ironically, El-Al Queda, as the new airline is called, is the result of increased security on other airlines. "It's hard to be a good terrorist when you can't even take a pair of box cutters on a plane," Humad says. In fact, El-Al Queda has a very different approach to security. "If you're NOT carrying a bomb or a weapon, it's hard to get on," an El-Al Queda baggage handler says. "We're in the business of spreading WMDs. We can't give seats to every little terroristwannabe." And in the event a bomb does go off, blowing up the plane, the terrorists say there's no way to know which bomb caused it -- so each of the terrorists would get the 72 virgins they're promised when they go to heaven as a martyr. "It's a win-win situation," says Humad. Published on: 07/30/2004

       urlLink    LAUGH-A-MINUTE RUMSFELD BECOMES A CLOWN Sec. of Defense can't resist a pratfall, says insider  Washington insiders are abuzz with the news that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld plans to resign his Cabinet position -- and become a circus clown! According to a highly placed Pentagon source, Rumsfeld -- who has been a Navy pilot, White House chief of staff, U.S. ambassador to NATO, U.S. Congressman and CEO of two Fortune 500 companies -- has long dreamed of making children laugh by donning a red nose and floppy shoes. "Rummy will make a great clown," says the insider. "He's always joking around. We can count on him to entertain us at Pentagon meetings with his water- squirting lapel flower and bucket of water that turns out to be confetti. He can't resist a pratfall. "He's a riot!" Signs early in Rumsfeld's life pointed to an eventual career in show business. As a young boy, according to childhood buddy Kevin Koshar, "Rummy would put on these elaborate puppet shows always featuring himself as a singing, tap-dancing general leading a war against a defenseless Third World nation."

      STUDY SHOWS REPUBLICANS ARE KETCHUP FREAKS!  Which condiment you favor when you lather your hot dog -- ketchup or mustard -- reveals your politics, according to a noted political scientist."People who mostly or entirely use ketchup are much more likely to favor the invasion of Iraq than those who use mustard," says Dr. Noah Frum, a senior fellow at the prestigious Institute for Political Advantage think tank."Red is an aggressive, war-like color, whereas yellow is much more passive and low-key, " he says. Dr. Frum conducted his study when one of the political parties, looking for an advantage in the upcoming November elections, came to him looking for new ways to identify possible supporters."We'd done the usual ones -- income, gender, education -- so we decided to focus on food."Dr Frum gathered a number of subjects together, placed hot dogs and hamburgers in front of them, and gave them their choice of ketchup or mustard. Then he asked their opinions on a number of subjects, including the war in Iraq, terrorism and immigration."The ketchup eaters were much more likely to favor aggressive policies than the mustard-eaters," he says. "Their food preferences weren't the only thing that was 'yellow'."

      I just finished the online application for Florida Dept of Education to receive my initial 3 year temporary teaching certificate. I requested to be certified in 2 subjects Business Education (6-12) Industrial Arts-Technology Education (6-12) Hopefully by getting both it will leave me open for more job  opportunities   After the state approves my application, I have 3 years to get my professional certification (all the "teacher" classes) The county we live in offers a one year accelerated program. I will go that route if possible.  Well, I am excited. All I can think about it I want to go back to school so I guess that means I need to go and work at one. But I have to get through this year in Baghdad hell first. Almost time for our cruise in the Mediterranean, 30 more days to wait. Athens here I come!

      By ANDREA PEYSER  BOSTON — These two really need to talk.  The VIP room was crowded and the champagne flowed as Hillary Rodham Clinton (news - web sites) moved her lips up to her husband's face. Bill Clinton (news - web sites) puckered up gratefully, apparently believing the woman he married was greeting him with a smooch.  Not a chance.  Bill and Hillary Clinton (news - web sites) breezed into town Sunday night, to a party thrown in their honor high atop an office building. They arrived separately.  They barely seemed to know one another.  Where Hillary was radiant, smiling, coyly batting away questions about her presidential hopes, Bill appeared thinner than I've ever seen him and introspective, bordering on morose.  At one point, he announced, quite bizarrely, that before his arrival at the party, "I felt pickled and old and half-dead."  Bill arrived before 9 p.m. and began holding court at one end of the VIP room. Hillary spotted him and wafted over to his side. And as I watched, in amazement, the pair who have been wed more than 20 years engaged in one of those embarrassing physical misunderstandings that usually occur between strangers.  Hillary leaned in to Bill's face, and he responded by giving her a little kiss. But Hillary completely bypassed her hubby's willing orifice, and instead moved her own maw up to his ear, into which she whispered, curtly, "That's John's brother."  Bill looked momentarily confused.  "John Kerry (news - web sites)'s brother!" she said sharply, and she pointed Bill in the direction of Cameron Kerry.  And then she was gone.  It was plain as the embarrassment on Bill Clinton's face. The power sinew that has joined this couple has changed.  Bill lingered in the VIP room for a long while, chatting, signing his memoir, posing for pictures. At one point, he placed his hand on my bare shoulder.  "The senator is ready when you are," a staffer informed him, telegraphing Hillary's impatience.  "She's ready!" another staffer shouted, more urgently this time.  Any remaining doubt of the weirdness between them was removed when the couple finally took the stage in the main party room, next to Chelsea in curly hair and a Pucci-print silk get-up. Her parents linked hands and smiled like an actual couple.  Hillary spoke first. "Let me introduce you to Chelsea's father, a best-selling author, the man who taught the Democrats how to win again. A great, great president for the country we love . . . "  No mention of the fact she was married to him.  Bill was far stranger.  "I want to say thank you for being so rowdy and irreverent and loud," he told the crowd, saying that before he arrived at the party, "I felt pickled and old and half-dead — and you were having such a good time."  The pickled, old ex-prez then turned attention back to Hillary.  "She's the only one who can do anything for you anymore. She's got a real job."  I fear he needs help.   urlLink Yahoo!

      In his review of the Beatles songbook, Revolution in the Head, the late critic Ian MacDonald noted in passing that the quality of rock music declines precipitously after its creators turn 30. I thought this too harsh a judgment, until I crosschecked the rockers with their birthdates in the All Music Guide.  "Mick and Keith turned 30 in 1973, the year, not coincidentally, of Goat's Head Soup, the Stones last good album. Paul McCartney turned 30 in 1972, one year before his last decent album, Band on the Run. John Lennon turned 30 in 1970; last decent album, Plastic Ono Band, 1970. Bob Dylan, born 1941, last decent, New Morning, 1970. Lou Reed: born 1942, last good, Transformer, 1972. Rod Stewart, born 1945, last decent, A Night on the Town, 1976. Pete Townshend, born 1945, last good, Quadrophenia, 1973. Iggy Pop, born 1947, last good, Lust For Life, 1977. Elvis Costello, born 1955, last good, Blood & Chocolate, 1986. Prince, born 1958, last good, Sign 'O' The Times, 1987. Bono (U2), born 1960, last decent, Achtung Baby, 1991. Michael Stipe (REM), born 1960, last good, Automatic For the People, 1992."

       urlLink The grunge generation grows up | csmonitor.com   They were known for their lack of commitment. Now Generation X is making waves, its own way. By Kim Campbell | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor   NEW YORK - If the term "Generation X" brings to mind "slackers" who listen to grunge rock, you might want to take a closer look at the parents dropping off their kids at day care these days.  While no one was looking, Gen X grew up, and signs of their maturing are everywhere - from the release last month of the 10th-anniversary edition of the movie "Reality Bites," to a trend in stay-at-home moms.  Depending on whose measure you use, the first of the Xers will turn 40 next year - more than a decade after trend-spotters found similarities between the socially disengaged characters in the 1991 novel "Generation X" and the 20- somethings of the day.  Many of those in Gen X (born roughly between 1965 and 1979) now own their own companies, are raising children, and scoff at the stereotypes that were created about them in the early 1990s - particularly that they are cynical slackers who avoid commitment to jobs and relationships.  "That doesn't sound like me or most of my friends," says Tim Nekritz, a public relations professional and graduate student in his mid-30s from Oswego, N.Y. "We're like our parents' generation, in my opinion. We're getting married, having kids, settling down, buying houses.... I think we're like a lot of other generations that approach middle age."  Generation X may not have the numbers or the name recognition of the baby boomers, but its members - now approximately 25 to 39 years old, and 60 million strong - are putting their stamp on everything from parenting to planning for the future. Approaching their years of highest earning, this group is poised to influence not only housing prices and car styles, but social policy as well.  They live the life they want  More independent-minded than baby boomers, Gen Xers have been forging their own approach to adult life in recent years. Unlike their own parents, who had high divorce rates and dual incomes, Xer moms and dads are spending more time with their children, even leaving the workforce to raise them. Those who are single are also trying to balance work and a personal life.  "The legacy that the boomers gave Gen X was permission to do what you wanted, essentially," says Ann Clurman, a senior partner at Yankelovich, a marketing consulting firm that tracks generational trends. "And Gen X has really taken up that banner: If you want to have kids, have kids. If you want to work, work. If you want to stay home, stay home."  Whereas boomers tend to feel they have a moral duty to tell the world when they find the right way to do something, members of Gen X are more private, says Ms. Clurman. Xers are less ideological than boomers, and "that's one of the reasons that people sort of ... ignored them for a while, because they were hard to understand."  But the picture is becoming clearer of what this generation looks like as CEOs and diaper-changers. Defying the apathetic label, Xers have shown an entrepreneurial spirit and are more attuned to the need to invest for retirement, having been told there may be little Social Security left when the 76 million boomers are done with it. Gen X is said to be the first generation that may end up worse off than their parents, but they are also the first to enter the workforce as major innovations in communication technology - e-mail, cellphones, high-speed Internet access - were taking over.  The result? They live the way they want to.  "I believe my generation is constantly seeking ways to blend work and life together," says Heather Malec, who's in her early 30s, by e-mail from Chicago.  Ms. Malec says she doesn't mind working from home before and after typical office hours if it means she can make it to an afternoon tennis class, for example. "It gives me the flexibility to work from wherever I need to in order to get the job done and still have a life."  Gen X parenting habits are of particular interest to those tracking generational trends.  Today, 51 percent of children under 18 have parents who qualify as Gen X, according to an analysis by Reach Advisors, a Boston marketing-strategy and research firm. (Reach Advisors also analyzed Census Bureau data to come up with the 60 million figure for the population of Gen X, which can vary depending on which beginning and ending dates are selected.)  Gen X moms and dads tend to be homebodies - they are willing to sacrifice one spouse's income to have a parent at home with the kids, and frequently have to go into debt to own a house. Sometimes they choose arrangements, such as each spouse working a part-time job, that ensure that both parents get time with the children.  "They're willing to do what it takes to have family stability, because they didn't get it when they were young," says Ann Fishman, president of Generational Targeted Marketing Corp. "So this is something new, the importance placed on raising your children."  In 2002, Yankelovich reported that 67 percent of Xer moms said they planned to do a better job of raising their children than the generation before them. And for the first time in decades, fewer women are returning to the workforce in the first year after giving birth, according to Census data. When Reach Advisors conducted a survey of 3,020 parents at the end of 2003 ("Generation X: From Grunge to Grown Up"), they found that the increase in stay-at-home moms can be attributed in part to decisions made by college-educated Gen X women in households with incomes of more than $120,000 a year.  Dads spend more time with the family  Gen X dads are also trying to be more involved. Marty Kotis, president and CEO of Kotis Properties in Greensboro, N.C., says in e-mails and a phone interview that he worked from home for six to eight weeks after his son was born last year, and continues to actively participate in his son's upbringing.  "I think the approach with baby boomers was a lot more hands-off," says the 35-year-old, explaining he knows fathers of that generation who never changed a diaper. "My wife doesn't work right now, but I still feel like we should share the joys and responsibilities of raising our son."  The implications for labor markets - and even housing prices - of fewer working spouses are significant, notes James Chung, an Xer and president of Reach Advisors. An outcome of only one parent working is that couples are not as set on living a convenient distance from the workplace of both parents. "What you're seeing is [that] house prices are rising faster in communities that cater to those [single-income] families," he says.  Mr. Kotis is an example of another Xer trait: He plans for the future, particularly for retirement. Not long after he was elevated to the head of his family's company, he established a 401(k) program for the firm's employees, a majority of whom are Xers, too. "I sort of think of [Social Security] as a joke," he says. "I don't think it's going to be around when I'm old enough to need it."  Studies suggest his attitude is shared by others of his generation. Yankelovich has found that Xers have their eyes on retirement at an earlier age than boomers did, says Clurman. And the recent Reach Advisors survey found that 29 percent of Gen Xers versus 22 percent of boomers were saving for retirement with 401(k) or other defined contribution plans.  "This is a generation that does not necessarily expect to have the same kind of financial security as their parents do," says Mr. Chung. "And that's a big change."

      Sometimes, when the fahrenheit hits 100 in the middle of summer, it's a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ask Michael Moore.  The Oscar-winning filmmaker's latest fireball of a documentary, the President Bush ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites )-bashing Fahrenheit 9/11, cooked up another $5 million in ticket sales this weekend, ranking in seventh place on the weekly box-office rundown.  But more importantly, the film, already the highest grossing documentary since its first weekend in theaters, hit the $100 million mark on Saturday, becoming the first doc in history to reach that milestone. Its total haul stands at $103.3 million in five weeks of release. Not too shabby for a film that cost just $6 million to make.  In a conference call Sunday, Moore credited the success to the public's desire to "look for the truth and begin the important discussion and debate that needs to take place in this county." Besides, he said,"right now it's really cool to talk about politics."  Moore also said that judging by his mail and snooping around cineplexes, Fahrenheit 9/11's record box office shows that people "want to go to a good movie. I don't think they are saying, 'Let's go see a documentary tonight.' I think they are saying that they've heard that this movie is funny, they've heard that this movie is sad, they've heard that this movie will show them things that they have never seen before, and I think that's why we all like to go to the movies."  Lions Gate, which, along with IFC Films, agreed to distribute the documentary after it was dissed by Disney, reports Fahrenheit 9/11 has performed best on the coasts, but is peforming strongly throughout the entire country. Although its audience is chiefly Democratic, the film is reportedly also scoring very well with independents. Perhaps most surprisingly, the studio says surveys suggest that more than 40 percent of the Republicans who have seen the movie would recommend it to others.  "I believe this movie is going to bring hundreds of thousands of people to the polls who otherwise were not going to vote," said Moore, who describes audiences as being very moved by the plight of the soldiers and their families. (Sony is planning on releasing a DVD version of the film by September.)  More also says that the film has benefited from free publicity, mostly courtesy of conservative types who continue to complain about the film, try to ban it from theaters, encourage illegal downloading of the film or evict Linda Ronstadt ( urlLink news ) from Vegas casinos when she praised the film.  "A month ago it was all about, 'This movie is just going to preach to the converted.' Well the converted came the first weekend...and as each weekend goes by it's not the hardcore political people--they did not wait--the people going now are the people that live in that great gray middle of America, people who don't necessarily consider themselves political people, but who are interested in the movie now because they turn on the TV and it's Linda Ronstadt one day, it's people on Fox going nuts, going absolutely nuts...and they go, 'Maybe I should go check this movie out.'"  Finally, Moore couldn't resist on zinger at Mickey's expense. "If you had told me when we were going through all our pre-distribution problems with Disney that this film would gross more than any other Disney film this year...I don't even know to respond to that," he said.  For his part Mouse House big cheese Michael Eisner has been gracious--perhaps because, as part of his deal with the film's producers, Disney gets to pick charities that will receive the bulk of Fahrenheit 9/11's profits. Eisner has also admitted to seeing the doc he dumped, telling the Associated Press, "The reason it is a hit is it's entertaining. I thought it was like going to a rock concert. I loved it, but not in a political [sense]."  The White House continues to try to ignore the movie. But Moore is trying to change that. He says that he plans to make an announcement this week during the Democratic National Convention about "my attempts to get [President Bush] to see the movie and an offer that I plan to make to him so that he has a chance to see the movie."

       urlLink       BUSH USING VOODOO TO K.O. KERRY  That old black magic has George in its spell!  Desperate to win a second term in the White House, President Bush has reportedly turned to an unconventional weapon in his political arsenal: Voodoo!  A source on Bush's reelection team says the president has already used the ancient magic to boost both the economy and his performance in election polls. His next plan is to cast a devastating curse on his Democratic challenger, U.S. Sen. John Kerry, to smash Kerry's chances of booting Bush from the White House.  "They're already working on the Kerry doll that will activate the curse," says the source. "Kerry might not want to do any more bike-riding this summer."  But even more eye-opening is the way Bush got the magic that has pumped up his performance and may help him lay waste to Kerry: He forced powerful voodoo spells from ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.  A former White House aide says Bush acquired Aristide's powers when he had the embattled leader removed from Haiti and flown to Africa. "Aristide once told him, 'If you can't smear 'em, curse 'em,' " the source says. "Now they've decided to take the advice -- and they made Aristide give them the goods.  "Look at how the situation in Haiti has deteriorated since Aristide was yanked out in February -- and how Bush's fortunes gave risen. That's no coincidence."  He points to the sudden pickup in the economy in March and April, and to polls that showed Bush topping Kerry by several points despite disastrous news from Iraq.  "And it all started after Aristide," says the former aide.  Emboldened by the success of those spells, Bush is now constructing a curse aimed squarely at Kerry.  A senior Bush strategist says Bush at first hesitated on the hex. "He met with one of Haiti's most respected witch doctors, who advised him that black-magic voodoo -- the kind used to hurt rather than to help -- is extremely difficult to control. The spells he used to improve the economy and his poll numbers were positive spells, but using a spell to hurt another human being, either physically or spiritually, can seriously backfire."  But the president finally decided to take the risk, on the recommendation of one of his closest advisers. "Mr. Bush told us at our May strategy session: 'We've never been shy about getting nasty in a campaign, and I'm tired of swatting at Kerry. I want to win so big, it's gonna make Ronald Reagan look like he barely made it into office back in 1980.'  "He told us, 'I want some powerful mojo, and I want it now.' "  Sources say Bush operatives are being planted in the Kerry campaign to obtain key elements of the Kerry voodoo doll: Scraps of the candidate's hair, skin, clothing and handwriting. The doll will be used to bring on a combination of physical pains and political setbacks.  "Maybe Kerry's shoulder will start giving him trouble again," says a source, referring to the injury for which Kerry had surgery in March.  "Maybe the campaign bus will run out of gas on the way to an important speech. Or maybe he'll just make some boneheaded statement that turns everybody off.  "But I'm not sure we need to put any hexes on Kerry to get him to say something that makes him look bad," the source says. "His speeches were cursed for months before we thought of it."  &nbsp; urlLink

       Our Fox campaign is becoming a major fight. The attacks are now coming from Fox -- in an attempt to intimidate other media outlets. We need your help. It's time to take this to Congress. On Friday, we'll deliver our Fox petition to members of Congress and we need to have at least 250,000 comments from across the nation. We're pushing members of Congress to make Fox come clean about its rank partisanship. Go to:  At first, Fox's strategy was to ignore our charges. But it didn't work. Outfoxed is now the best-selling DVD on Amazon.com. All the major newspapers are asking whether Fox is "fair and balanced." Editorial cartoonists are poking fun at Fox's Republican slant. We've attached links to a few of the best stories and cartoons below.  Last night on Fox News, Bill O'Reilly exploded over all the criticism, declaring war between his network and the New York Times in an attempt to distract from the charges made in the film. This is typical, of course. But no one at Fox has answered any of the charges: Why are there so many Republican commentators and guests compared to Democrats? (The media monitor FAIR reports five to one.) Why does Fox business management dictate how the news is framed in its daily memos? Why would Fox assign a reporter whose wife was out campaigning for Bush at the time to conduct an exclusive interview with him? How can Fox's slogan "Fair and Balanced" be anything other than an attempt to deceive viewers and advertisers?  So instead of responding, Fox is going to try to bully other media outlets into going silent on this story. We've got to fight back. Please join our petition now at:    The timing of this petition is perfect, because Congress is beginning to take up the issue. This afternoon, dozens of members of Congress will be viewing Outfoxed in a special showing. Several members of the House have drafted a letter asking Rupert Murdoch to come before them to discuss how he'll correct the partisan bias at Fox.  After you sign the petition, let friends know about the campaign. People are furious when they see how Fox does business.  If you haven't seen the movie, you can get a copy now by making a contribution of $30 or more to AlterNet at:   As part of this campaign, we've got to support good media, and AlterNet is a great independent outlet. But even more importantly, AlterNet is leading the challenge by other media outlets of Fox's outrageous attempt to hold the trademark "Fair and Balanced." Believe it or not, if Fox succeeds in holding that trademark, it can sue to keep all others from using these words.  Let's keep up the pressure. Thank you for all you do.  Sincerely,--Carrie, Joan, Lee, Marika, Noah, Peter, and Wes&nbsp;&nbsp;The MoveOn.org Team&nbsp;&nbsp;July 21st, 2004  P.S. After you sign the petition, enjoy these great editorial cartoons about Fox's Republican favor and two articles about this campaign:  Doonesbury has been "interviewing" Rupert Murdoch all week: "Fox News slogan challenged," Associated Press

       urlLink Debunking Farenheit 9/11    A 17 year-old girl debunks Moore's crockumentary. I'm beginning to think my dog "Bristol" could.  Here is one of the highlights... Moore seems to have a knack for ignoring relevant information. Upon discussing the Coalition of the Willing, he only mentions the small countries that don’t possess troops, while leaving out the countries which do, such as Poland, England and Australia.24 And of course we’re supposed to be disgusted that our armed forces possess large quantities of low-income earners and minorities, and that recruiters often go to the more unfortunate towns, looking for people to enlist. Think about that argument. Leftists like Moore are upset when a company doesn’t hire enough minorities and upset when the military hires too many! Only someone as ungrateful as Michael Moore, could be appalled at the fact that low-income earners from places like Flint, MI are “targeted” by the military and granted the greatest opportunities that America has to offer- education, money, benefits, housing, training, food and heroism. But, of course, Moore sees none of these things. He is still too blinded by his hatred for the United States and his belief that the U.S. military is the embodiment of shame.

       urlLink Yahoo! Sports - NASCAR - Dale Earnhardt Jr. burned after crash  SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. was treated for minor burns on his face and legs and hospitalized after an accident Sunday during practice for the American Le Mans Series Infineon Grand Prix of Sonoma.   Medical officials at Infineon Raceway described the injuries as ``moderate-sized burns of moderate intensity.'' Earnhardt was flown to the University of California-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento for precautionary reasons.   During a 30-minute practice, Earnhardt's Chevrolet Corvette C5-R spun and hit a barrier in turn eight of the road racing track, catching fire. Earnhardt quickly got out of the car on his own before being assisted by safety crews.   Earnhardt, who regularly competes in the Nextel Cup Series, was to have driven in Sunday's ALMS race with veteran road racing driver Boris Said. The team has withdrawn the car from the race.

      For those who somehow missed it the 1st time around... and like to question my knowledge.. here are the hard facts...   urlLink   Reader's Companion to American History By 1916, twenty-one states had banned saloons. National elections that year returned a Congress in which dry members outnumbered the wets two-to-one. In December 1917, Congress submitted to the states the Eighteenth Amendment, which, when ratified in 1919, placed in the Constitution a nationwide ban on the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors." By that time most of the states had been dry for years. In 1920, the Volstead Act was to most Americans a belated confirmation of an earlier reality.  The End of Prohibition December 5, 1933, marks the end of Prohibition for the United States. Utah was the last state to ratify the 21st Amendment, which nullified the 18th Amendment. The 18th Amendment prohibited the sale or transportation of liquor.

'AWOL was billed as the 'ultimate party toy' that could get users drunk 10 times faster,' said an official of the Australian state. 'This sends an irresponsible message about alcohol consumption.'

      Senators Kerry And Edwards Are Two Of Only Four US Senators Who Voted For The Use Of Force Resolution Against Iraq And Against The $87 Billion Supplemental Supporting Our Troops.   So, in response to the  Kerry and Edwards Pledge to Relieve Strains on Overburdened Military Post  Again, Kerry show's how he can not really take a stand on any issue. If you feel so stongly about relieving the strain on our military would you not want it to happen NOW? Does Kerry think that the military can wait till  maybe   when he finally get's elected for their Body-Armor.   "John Kerry's reckless claim to be 'proud' of opposing funds to support the troops is in direct contradiction to his own earlier statement that such a vote would be 'irresponsible.' He voted to send forces into harm's way and then wrongly voted against critical funding for American troops in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan."  - Steve Schmidt, Bush-Cheney '04

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Passions drive debate on gay marriage off course  In the past 40 years, the U.S. Constitution has been amended only three times: to set rules on congressional pay raises, lower the voting age to 18 and transfer power to the vice president if a president is incapacitated. All involve governance.  By contrast, most emotion-driven campaigns to prescribe social behavior in the Constitution have failed. Prohibition of alcohol in 1919 was so divisive, it was repealed in 1933. Recent efforts to ban abortion and flag burning and restore prayer in the classroom haven't even gotten out of Congress.  Social mores of the moment merit vigorous debate and legislative action. They don't deserve to be enshrined for the ages in our most precious legal documents.     Just for the record... I do not support a constitutional amendment barring Gay Marriages...

With experts around the country expressing concern in recent months that our military is overstretched, the Democrats said we must take steps to alleviate strains on our overburdened military.  “As President, I will always remember that America’s security begins and ends with the soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine – with every man and every woman in our armed services standing a post somewhere in the world,” Kerry said. “Today, we must do more to keep our commitment to the men and women who wear our uniform.”  Operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have left our military stretched too thin – a concern expressed just this week by General Richard Cody, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. The Bush administration’s answer has been to put band-aids on the problem – calling-up members of the Individual Ready Reserve, extending tours of duty, delaying retirements, preventing personnel from leaving and using a stop-loss policy as a back door draft.    “When you add it up, we are in danger of creating another hollow Army,” Kerry said. “I will modernize our military to match its new missions and fight for a constant standard of decency and respect for those who serve their country in our armed forces.”  As commander in chief, Kerry’s first order of business will be to expand America’s active duty forces to relieve this current overstretch and to prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts. This step will increase our security and alleviate strains on our overburdened military.   Kerry and Edwards will also fight for a Military and Family Bill of Rights that will treat members of the military and their families with the dignity and respect they deserve.   A comprehensive plan, the Military Family Bill of Rights will ensure that service members and military families are treated fairly. It will make sure troops do not face pay cuts and give them the protections they need on the battlefield and at home, like allies by their side,  body-armor  and other equipment, health care for all military reservists, assistance for families affected by extended deployments, support for small business and reservists and up-to-date and accurate information about deployments.  “We need a commander in chief who will keep the American people safe, who will keep our military strong and who will stand up for the men and women who serve this country,” Edwards said. “John Kerry will stand up for the young men and women who serve us abroad and who serve us at home. And, he’ll stand up for the millions of Americans who have served us before—our country’s veterans.”

      Congress is about to vote on amending the U.S. Constitution to deny marriage equality to same-sex couples.   Never before has our Constitution been amended to take away anyone's rights. Yet our Senators will vote on this amendment in the next 48 hours.   It's urgent that we speak up now. This hateful divisiveness has no place in America. Please join me in saying so, at:   http://www.moveon.org/unitednotdivided/   Equality in marriage is the civil rights issue of our generation. We can't let anyone, or any group, be singled out for discrimination based on who they are or who they love.

These funds provided body armor and other force protection measures such as armored Humvees, as well as health care for reservists, support for families and meals for injured soldiers.   I cannot even respond to this! Anyone that would deny any support for the troops is beyond words to me.... I see these troops (Kids) everyday standing at check points to protect me. Anyone that feels proper body armor is not a must needs to be at one of these check-points when a car bomb goes off! If they were at a check point without it most would not make it out alive to tell us about it! Regardless, how you feel about us being in over here how can you deny the proper equipment to the people that need it most. Most of these kids here have no idea the politics behind this war. All they know is they were ordered to be here and it is our job to protect them anyway we can...

      Tony should have no pity.  I do not like him any less that he is a driving maniac, but I just think he is having some greater issues at the time.  There have been FAR TOO MANY episodes of careless and wreckless driving, and one should consider his extracurricular activities at this time.

       urlLink On the dairy farm: A voyage into the milky way Herd produces 20,000 pounds a day BY KARA M. CONNERS Press & Sun-Bulletin   NANTICOKE -- The faint smell of manure, drill-like hum of the milking machine and the occasional "moo" of more than 500 cows become fixtures of a day that starts at 5:30 a.m. and runs well into the night.   On a recent afternoon, a black-and-white border collie-Labrador retriever mix named Diesel rolled in a sweet-smelling pile of sawdust, tugging on a leash held by 13-year-old Aubrey Whittaker. Aubrey is youngest of the three children who work on the Whittaker Dairy Farm, their parents' 800-acre operation off State Route 26.   Some of the calves, each kept in an individual wooden hutch, crane their necks and lick Aubrey and her mother, Judi, with long purple-white tongues. The 40 members of the young herd chew and lick anyone or anything that walks by the hutches -- it's instinct. Yet the calves rarely complain, unless they need something.   "Just like a baby," Judi Whittaker said, "the only time you hear from them is when they need something."   The coarse feel of the calves' sandpapery tongues and wet snouts are conditions to which Aubrey has adjusted since she began feeding the calves last fall. Thousands of flies buzz around the calves' plastic buckets of vanilla-scented milk and sweet-smelling grain. More flies stick to a bright green strip of fly paper draped over a row of hutches.   Scott Whittaker's grandfather, Lewis Whittaker, founded the farm in 1915. Scott Whittaker's uncle Roscoe Whittaker inherited the farm. Scott and Judi bought the farm from Roscoe in 1981. In 1984, when the farm was milking about 100 cows, a fire destroyed two barns and killed 27 heifers.   Since then, the family has built and expanded the farm into a $1-million-per-year agri-business that employs the five Whittakers and three other people. The operation includes a 1.6-million-gallon manure pit and a group of concrete-walled food bunkers. Each cow consumes 100 or so pounds of food and drinks 100 gallons of water daily.   Across a worn path of gravel and dirt, a generator-like machine hums as a line of 20 cows slowly move into milking order. A cow must be at least 2 years old to produce milk; about 250 of the Whittakers' cows are old enough to be milked. The first of the three daily milkings begins at 5:30 a.m. and takes three to four hours.   Inside a cool, metal A-frame building, Keith Yalch of Lisle wears a mud-stained T-shirt and work boots as he hoses the cows' udders with a sterilization solution to prepare them for milking.   A milking machine latches onto the cow's udders like a vacuum cleaner and sucks the milk through a clear rubber tube into a 3,000-gallon steel drum, causing the cow's milk vein to swell like an enlarged intestine. The herd produces 20,000 pounds of raw, unpasteurized milk each day.   After milking, Yalch dips each cow's udders in iodine to stimulate milk production.   Piles of sand-like feed sit near the milking facility. The cows, which weigh about 1,400 pounds fully grown, eat ground corn, cotton seed and a protein mixture. The Whittakers will occasionally alter diets so the cows will produce milk that contains more protein or fat.   A truck picks up the milk daily. Though it's tough to say exactly what dairy product the Whittakers' milk will become, it often goes to a processing plant in Waverly to be made into mozzarella cheese.   The Whittakers have two of the six types of milking cows -- Jerseys and Holsteins. Jersey cows are brown or tan; Holsteins are black and white. A dry-eraser board lists the identification numbers of cows that are in heat, pregnant or sick.   The pregnant cows are placed in a special barn as they wait to deliver. On July 4 a cow gave birth to triplets -- the first time on the farm in 30 years. The family normally doesn't keep the male calves; the bulls are typically sold for beef.   "When a male is born, their life is generally a lot shorter," Scott Whittaker said. Females live an average of eight to nine years.   In each cow's right ear is a yellow or orange number tag containing the cow's birthday, and the Whittakers' herd information. In the cow's left ear is a metal identification tag that's part of the National Farm Animal Identification system, a database that helps farmers track animals' origins and geneaology.   The federal government sets regional milk prices, which can significantly vary from month to month. Currently, milk is selling for $20 for 100 pounds; last year prices hovered around $11. Sometimes it can be an unsettling lifestyle.   "We really sweat it sometimes," Scott Whittaker said. "Sometimes you are lucky to break even, and sometimes you are lucky to make a little money."

      The whole incident yesterday was not done intentionally. It happened on the start-up and looked to me like Kasey missed a gear. Tony is a total victim here! On the green flag what do you do? This isn't rocket science.. You total floor the gas pedal. Kasey tried to do that and his car didn't respond leaving Tony with no where to go.  Nascar fans just want to have a "Bad Guy" Looks like they have picked Tony for the job... As we all know, I am not even a Stewart fan. The Rainbow Warrior is my boy. I know Tony has even spun Jeff on pit road in the past. But remember that is the past and people should not be judged on past mistakes when they have admitted to them and accepted blame.

      By picking John Edwards as his running mate, John Kerry has brought new energy to his ticket. "I have chosen a man who understands and defends the values of America," Kerry said at a rally yesterday. "Throughout this campaign, John talked about the great divide in America, the two Americas that exist between those who are doing very well and those who are struggling to make ends meet in our country.  That concern is at the center of this campaign . . . It is what the 35 years of my struggle have been about. And I am so proud that together John Edwards and I are now going to fight to build one America for all Americans."    This first big decision for John Kerry demonstrates that he’s committed to progressive values and ready to do what it takes to win.  To celebrate, the Kerry/Edwards campaign is offering FREE new Kerry/Edwards bumper stickers on its website.  Sign up to spread the word about the Kerry/Edwards ticket and get a free sticker today at:  http://www.johnkerry.com/signup/bumper_KE.php

       urlLink PARTY PLAYING THE CHARISMA CARD VS. GOP -NY Post-By DEBORAH ORIN  John Kerry went for a jolt of charisma when he tapped John Edwards for veep on a John-John ticket — instead of the guy he thought would make the best president.   Edwards adds rock-star political glamour as the most charismatic Democratic speaker since Bill Clinton — although Edwards actually won just one 2004 Democratic primary (in South Carolina, where he was born).   When they were rivals, Kerry ridiculed Edwards as someone who'd need "on-the-job training" and gibed he wasn't sure if the fresh-faced Edwards was even "out of diapers" when Kerry came home from Vietnam.

      Firing back at the Mouse   Jeff Snyder / Reuters File Michael Moore --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Michael Moore is blasting Disney for releasing a patriotic film after refusing to distribute “Fahrenheit 9/11.”  The movie company had said that it didn’t want to release Moore’s Bush-bashing flick because it didn’t want to be involved in politics, then it distributed “America's Heart & Soul,” a pro-America film that is being promoted by Move America Forward, a group that had tried to block’s Moore’s flick.  “Disney joining forces with the right wing kooks who have come together to attempt to censor 'Fahrenheit 9/11' must mean that Dumbo is now in charge of the company’s strategic decisions,” Moore said in a statement posted on his web site. “First, Disney tried to stop the movie from being released and now it is aligning itself with the very people who are trying to intimidate the movie theaters from showing the movie. Even Donald Duck would tell you this makes no sense.”

It is, of course, an enraging film, although, I would argue, not for the conventional, “we were lied to by a cabal of oilmen” reasons.  But for the moment, allow me to address the film’s final scene, a montage of clips “demonstrating” that “Bush lied” about Iraq’s supposed connection to 9-11; that the American people—a trusting, if simple, group—were buncoed into connecting “secular Saddam” to the zealots of Al-Qaeda. Let’s be clear about this, for it bears repeating: the administration has repeatedly and forcefully connected Iraq and Al-Qaeda—and, as recent evidence has shown, for good reason. What the administration has not done—contrary to popular belief—is publicly link Iraq to the attacks of September 11.   But, you protest, I saw Condoleezza Rice in Fahrenheit 9-11 tell a reporter that, “indeed,” there was a relationship!   ROLL FILM:   “Oh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11.”   CUT.  Pretty damning stuff, isn’t it? But that was the truncated, Michael Moore version. Now for the full, unexpurgated quote:   “Oh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11. It’s not that Saddam Hussein was somehow himself and his regime involved in 9/11, but, if you think about what caused 9/11, it is the rise of ideologies of hatred that lead people to drive airplanes into buildings in New York.”  Well that’s a different quote, Mike. So why the editing?

      BIBLE BLOOPERS These unholy howlers actually made it into print Translators who've been working on The Bible since the 15th Century have their off days, too. Before mechanical printing began in A.D. 1450, writers painstakingly hand-copied ancient literature in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic into English. An argument with the wife, a late night drinking or problems with a rebellious teen at home can mean mistakes at work - and bloopers in the Good Book. Here are just a few that have appeared in various editions of the Bible over the years:   And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Sears.  It should be: . . . and the gathering of the waters He called Seas. - Genesis 1:10   Blessed is he who considers The Doors.  It should be: Blessed is he who considers the poor. - Psalms 41:1   Go now, and sin some more.  It should be: Go now, and sin no more. - John 8:11   Let the children first be killed.  It should be: Let the children first be filled. - Mark 7:27   He hath ears to leer, let him leer.  It should be: He hath ears to hear, let him hear. - Matthew 11:11   He who is without sin among you, should go forth and get stoned.  It should be: He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone --John 8:7   I will that women adorn themselves in modern apparel.   It should be: I will that adornthemselves in modest apparel. -- 1 Timothy 2:9   You shall have no other hogs before me.  It should be: You shall have no other gods before me. -- Deuteronomy 5:7

       urlLink    ALIENS CLAIM JACKO IS THEIR SON  And they want him back!   AN ALIEN couple, who claim to be Michael Jackson's real parents are suing Earth for full custody of him, says a man who claims to be an attorney for the ETs.   "My clients want him back immediately," says lawyer Bentley Leavent, 39. "They are disgusted and appalled at his life here and want him to come home now."   The self-proclaimed "King of Pop" was born in a galaxy far, far away on a planet named Zertonia -- too distant for even our mightiest telescopes to see, explains the California legal eagle.   His parents, who are named in court papers as Mr. and Mrs. Zortron, were only teenagers and not equipped to deal with the rigors of bringing up a child when they gave him up 46 years ago.   "Mr. Zortron was just beginning his four-year training to become a flying saucer mechanic," says Leavent.   "He was still living at his folks' house. They planned to wed when he graduated.   "They really loved little Michael, or Kerz-na, as they called him. But they felt it would be best if he were placed with parents who were more secure, mature people who would raise him with good, solid values and give him the moral background he needed to raise a family of his own someday."   But, the lawyer alleges, the alien couple were shocked to discover the Zertonian adoption broker had shipped their son to Earth.   They were even more concerned when they flew down here and got a peek at him frolicking at the Neverland Ranch.   "We were most displeased," they say in the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles.   "Kerz-na doesn't even look like an Earthling. His face is terrifying, even to us.   "Kerz-na was placed on a stage at a very early age and told to perform. This yelling and jumping around has clearly damaged his brain. He doesn't even live in a proper home! It's some kind of children's amusement park with monkeys.   "He needs our help. We're not blaming anyone. If anyone is to blame it's us for giving him away. His mother is heartbroken." Mr. and Mrs. Zortron say they won't make trouble for the Jackson family. They just want their baby back.   "The Zortron's are quite sure that Michael's family will send him back to Zertonia with no problem," says Leavent, who is reportedly the subject of a Bar Association investigation for making "highly dubious claims related to the practice of law."   According to the lawsuit, Mr. Zortron says as soon as custody is granted he will be on the first space ship to Earth to take his son home and make him a real man.   "Kerz-na already has a job lined up at my flying saucer garage," he explains. "Those guys won't put up with any of the nonsense he's gotten away with on Earth!"   &nbsp; urlLink

      A mother and her young inquisitive son were flying Southwest Airlines from Kansas City to Chicago. The son (who had been looking out the window) turned to his mother and asked, "If dogs have baby dogs and cats have baby cats, why don't planes have baby planes?"  The mother (who couldn't think of an answer) told her son to ask the flight attendant. So the boy dutifully asked the flight attendant, "If dogs have baby dogs and cats have baby cats, why don't planes have baby planes?"  The flight attendant responded, "Did your mother tell you to ask me that?" The little boy admitted that she did. "Well, then, tell your mother that there are no baby planes because Southwest always pulls out on time. Now, let your mother explain that to you."

      1. What was the first band you saw in concert? My first concert was Kenny Rogers at the Syracuse Carrier Dome. At age five, my parents took me because he was my favorite singer. I stood on my seat to see him, and sang along with every word. He is the best. My first band concert would be the Beach Boys in Saratoga Springs, NY. They played at an outdoor ampitheatre, of which, my parents took my sister and I because they are the absolute best; my dad's favorite.   It was cool to see all the people outside having fun, even passing around a giant beach ball. I must have been around eleven.  2. Who is your favorite artist/band now? My favorite band is Lynard Skynard. Their 30th anniversary is this year and I plan on seeing them in Detroit, MI on August 22nd, following the Michagan NASCAR race. The band lost its founder/frontman Ronnie Van Zant on October 20th, 1977 to a devastating airplane crash...but their music lives on. They rock!  3. What's your favorite song? My favorite song is Back in Black by AC/DC. The guitar riffs are crazy hard- core, and the song speaks of making a statement where ever you go.  4. If you could play any instrument, what would it be? I would absolutely love to be able to play the gui-tar... ohh the music I would make.  5. If you could meet any musical icon (past or present), who would it be and why? If I could meet a musical icon, I would love to meet Bob Marley... for obvious reasons.

       1. What was the first band you saw in concert?  Whoever sings that song "Delta Dawn" and I just found out that would be "Tanya Tucker" when I was about 6 years old. The 1st Band would be KISS.   2. Who is your favorite artist/band now?  I guess I just do not have one. 3. What's your favorite song? Jam On It by Newcleus-it is the best break dancing song ever it came out like in 1983 one of the 1st rap hip-hop songs.   urlLink For the lyrics click here    4. If you could play any instrument, what would it be?  Piano-I Like the Mix of Ebony and Ivory.   5. If you could meet any musical icon (past or present), who would it be and why?

       1. What was the first band you saw in concert? I have been going to concerts since before I can remember so I going to base this on concerts that I actually wanted to go to! The first concert that I was the actually ticket holder was Belinda Carlisle for my 11th or 12th B-Day. Now, the first band that I requested to go to would be Posion in either 1989 or 1990. I know people who will be reading this remember that concert and how we got right up near the stage. My mom and her friend Peggy were with me and my sister during the whole concert. When it got rough up front, Peggy elbowed a man in the kidney since he kept pushing on my sister.   2. Who is your favorite artist/band now?  Dave Matthews Band-that for sure hands down but I have a wide variety of music tastes so my favorite country band right now would be Rascal Flatts and you cannot forget the classics like Billy Joel, Elton John, and Bob Seager! Or the country classics like Waylon, Willie and Merle.  3. What's your favorite song?  Of all time would have to be Merle Haggard-Are the Good Times Really Over ( I Wish A Buck Was Still Silver) Ok I can't help myself I must incluse the lyrics...just a sidenote-when I actually seen Merle a few years ago he did not sing this song and I along with many others in the audience could not believe it! I wish a buck was still silver and it was back when the country was strong. Back before Elvis and before the Vietnam war came along. Before the Beatles and yesterday when a man could still work and still would. Is the best of the free life behind us now and are the good times really over for good ? Are we rollin' downhill like a snowball headed for hell? With no kind of chance for the flag or the liberty bell? I wish a Ford or a Chevy would still last ten years like they should. Is the best of the free life behind us now and are the good times really over for good? I wish Coke was still cola and a joint was a bad place to be. It was back before Nixon lied to us all on TV. Before Microwave ovens when a girl could still cook, and still would. Is the best of the free life behind us now and are the good times really over for good ? Are we rollin' downhill like a snowball headed for hell? With no kind of chance for the flag or the liberty bell? I wish a Ford or a Chevy would still last ten years like they should. Is the best of the free life behind us now and are the good times really over for good? Stop rollin' downhill like a snowball headed for hell. Standup for the flag, and let's all ring the liberty bell. Let's make a Ford and a Chevy that'll still last ten years like they should... The best of the free life is still yet to come and the good times ain't really   4. If you could play any instrument, what would it be?  The Saxophone-I just love the way it sounds and people always look Ultra Cool playing it!     5. If you could meet any musical icon (past or present), who would it be and why?  Elvis-I have always been really into Elvis and meeting him.. Wait can I pick the year I would want to meet him in? Ok, I can. Like around 1958 when he was hot and before he meet Priscilla! Presently I would like to meet Dave Matthews and have a beer with him in the bar he started at in VA!  Ok again everyone I would like you to participate but if you decide you do not have time for such nonsense I totally understand. I did actually get BoNy to particpate in last weeks and I think he really enjoyed it but he expected more comments and was disapointed!

Kim White uses dead stock never-used textiles intended for use in American automobiles: cars, trucks and vans. She fortuitously unearthed an entire warehouse of automotive fabric, which may be the last existing stock anywhere in the US, and she is the sole owner of these amazing textiles. Each Kim White Handbag is tagged with the year and make of the fabric, so the customer knows exactly what car their new bag has come from (i.e.: 1983 Camero or a 1978 Ford). Kim White Handbags specializes in material from the 1970’s and early 1980’s, when color was de rigueur in the automotive industry.&nbsp; urlLink

       CLINTON SETS SIGHTS ON THE OLSEN TWINS-FRIENDS CLAIM   X-PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has two important goals these days -- promoting his new best-selling book -- and dating the Olsen twins, shocked insiders say. According to one of Clinton's friends, who asks to remain anonymous, "as soon as Mary- Kate and Ashley turned 18, Bill said: 'O.K., it's time to get jiggy with them!' " Clinton has kept an Olsen twins scrapbook for years, has every TV show and movie they've done on video, and even has a secret shrine to them in his Harlem office, according to his friend. "And Bill told me, 'since they're actresses, I want them to help me act out my Twin Cheerleaders and The Lumberjack fantasies.' " How the Olsens will respond to Clinton's overtures is anybody's guess, but if the past is any indication, few women have been able to resist the Clinton charisma. None of Clinton's wild urges surprises Harvard University sociology professor Dr. Emil Dupree, who describes it as "a mixture of several classic dynamics, including Older Man/Younger Woman, One Man/Two Women, Father/Daughter, Government/Show Business." As for Hillary's reaction, Clinton's friend explains, "She doesn't know. Yet. But it's just a question of time. I keep telling Bill if he starts dating the Olsens, he better take out castration insurance. "But he only replied, 'I can't help it. I've got Olsen Fever!'"

      To achieve this level of chumminess, parents have often acted less like stern grownups and more like their kids' peers, joining the youth culture wholeheartedly at the mall, even purchasing the same teen-oriented clothes for themselves. This closeness continues and strengthens as Echo Boomers reach early adulthood. "The generation gap used to be a significant barrier between parents and adult kids," says Roberta Maisel. "But today's fiftysomething parent and twenty--something child have a lot of the same values and desires."   this is true!!!  plus i believe because life expectancies are longer there would obviously be an increase in adultlescents, in the same respect that marriages are delayed and people have kids later in their lives!

       urlLink By Pamela Paul  By housing their twenty-something children and financing their lives, today's parents may be compromising their own.    Does this hit close to home? Read the whole article linked above, if it does. Here are a few of what I consider the highlights that I would like to comment on...  Whatever the reason, young adults are returning home in increasing numbers--following graduation, the dissolution of a relationship or the loss of a job. They often live rent-free and subsidized, with no scheduled date for departure. But while much attention has been paid to live-at-home "adultescents," little has been said about their parents, many of whom are Baby Boomers who greet their boomerang kids with open arms. For a variety of emotional and demographic reasons--their desire to be close with their kids, a yearning for youth--many of today's parents (the original Peter Pan generation) just don't want their adult children to grow up.    shee_rah77 comment:   Adultescents- I like this term.    Some argue that permaparenting stems from the indulgence of an immature and spoiled generation. Others blame the phenomenon on the heavy hand of social and economic forces, especially the current recession. And our very definition of adulthood is in flux--with a homestead no longer a key component of adult identity.    shee_rah77 comment: I would say all the reasons are true except the "current recession" The world has always been in constant economic cycle, highs, lows(depressions), recessions but have we seen this phenomenon till now?   Shifting parental attitudes toward boomerang kids have much to do with generational differences, the result of each generation correcting and overcorrecting the excesses of the previous one. The wave that preceded the Boomers, the Swing, or Silent, generation (born during the Depression and World War II, 1930-1945) and their children, Generation X (born 1965-1978), were brought up during eras of economic recession, reduced birthrates and familial instability, when raising kids was not a societal focal point. Parents of Boomers "were eager for their kids to grow up and leave the household so that they could be free to pursue their own lives," says generational historian William Strauss. "Boomeranging home was a mark of failure for both children and parents." In contrast, the Baby Boomers themselves (born between 1946 and 1964) and their Echo Boomer offspring (1979 and 1994) have had the happy fortune to be born during periods of prosperity and family growth that place an emphasis on parenthood. From the 1980s hit The Cosby Show to kidcentric TV like Nickelodeon, Boomers were awash in media celebrating the rewards of child-rearing and the joys of childhood. Five times more parenting books are published today than in 1970.     shee_rah77 comment: Does it all really have to do with generational differences? I am not so sure that I agree with the period of prosperity/family growth that they like to call the "1980s"   Previous generations emphasized education and financial independence over all else for their children. In contrast, "Boomers are the first generation for whom their children's emotional fulfillment is a primary goal. Their parental mantra has been, 'Be happy or I'll kill you.'" In an effort to gratify their kids, Boomers have become unusually invested in their lives--determined to have an authentic, intimate relationship with their children.    shee_rah77 comment: I like the "Be happy or I'll kill you" but I would say Adultescents can only make themselves 'happy'   Whereas pre-Boomer parents--the GI and Depression/ War generations--reminded their children constantly of their sacrifices and taught them to be grateful for opportunities (what some might call "guilt-tripping"), Baby Boomers didn't want to do that to their kids. According to Adams, having grown up in an era of relative stability, Boomers inadvertently raised the next generation to feel entitled.   shee_rah77 comment: My grandma liked to remind us constantly how she only had one pair of shoes, one skirt for school and had to walk up a hill to get to school. I also remember her telling us she only had one coloring book and once she colored it she just would sit and look through it. Growing up when and how I did to think that was all she had was pretty much unbelievable but I always knew it was true, so she made me appreciate what I had with her "guilt-tripping"   Jeffrey Arnett, author of the upcoming book Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, believes boomeranging home may not be such a bad idea for twentysomethings but concedes it may not be best for parents. "Parents like being in a position to help their kids, and they like the fact that they get along well enough to live together," he says. "But parents are usually ready by then to move on with their own lives."   shee_rah77 comment: I am sure it is not a bad idea for the Adultescents where else can they live for free, eat for free, not pay bills, and not have to really answer to anyone.

       urlLink Prices paid to dairy farmers drop Consumers may pay less for milk   BY MY-LY NGUYEN Press & Sun-Bulletin   Binghamton-area dairy lovers may eventually see lower grocery bills as the surge in milk prices loses steam.   The national average farm-level price of milk -- or the amount farmers receive for the calcium-rich commodity -- has fallen about 28 cents per gallon from July to August, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Prices paid to farmers have dropped about 54 cents per gallon since June, when they reached record highs for the year.   As farm-level prices continue to retreat for the second consecutive month, consumers nationwide may end up paying less for milk at groceries and other retail outlets, reports the National Milk Producers Federation. The Arlington, Va.-based organization represents the nation's dairy farmers.   "It's outrageous how prices have skyrocketed," said Elliot Dixon, a 21-year-old from Endwell who uses about a gallon of 2 percent milk each week. "Milk's an essential thing for cereal, oatmeal, cooking and drinking. It'd be great if prices went back down."   Lower retail milk prices put more money in consumers' wallets, but they also mean less profits for dairy farmers who rely on the money to maintain their operations.   "Trying to balance your budget on 1970 prices of milk when you've got 2004 expenses is extremely difficult," said Judi Whittaker, who helps run the Whittaker dairy farm in Nanticoke.   Recent increases in farm-level milk prices helped dairy farmers like Whittaker recover from two years of extremely low payments for their products.   Now that farm-level prices are declining, Whittaker said she'll be keeping an even closer eye on the farm's finances.   "It's the nature of the business," she said. "You've just got to hope you've got your financials in line to ride it out."   Farmers typically receive only 30 cents for every dollar that consumers spend on dairy products, Milk Producers Federation President and Chief Executive Jerry Kozak said.   "We're hoping that prices don't sink back down to the record low levels of 2003," he said. "Many farmers can't take another stint of the 25-year lows like we had last year."   While it's reasonable to expect retail milk prices will start to fall, it's unclear when that time will come.   "We're hoping that retailers who quickly passed their higher input costs on to consumers this spring will be equally responsive as prices drop back down," Kozak said.   The price increases were largely the result of tight milk supplies, he said.   After two years of extremely low milk prices, many farmers chose to leave the dairy business or reduce their milk production, according to the federation.   As the number of cows decreased and milk supplies tightened, prices rose for farmers and consumers.   Binghamton-area consumers saw the price for a gallon of whole milk increase about 15 percent from May to July, according to the state Department of Agriculture & Markets.   "Our cost for milk has come down," Rochester-based Wegmans spokeswoman Jo Natale said. "It's hard to know what the future will bring, but we anticipate our costs may stay lower for a time."   Whittaker said consumers probably won't see retail milk prices drop immediately.   "It's just like gas prices," she said. "You never see them drop as quickly as they go up."

      IS RALPH NADER THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE?Secret Russian files recently uncovered by the U.S. government reveal Ralph Nader is destined to sweep the 2004 election and turn America into a Socialist paradise! "It's true," says a former Soviet KGB officer. "We had secret agents brainwash him while he was a student at Princeton during the height of the Cold War." According to the Russian, much as in the classic movie The Manchurian Candidate, Nader has been a ticking time-bomb for more than 50 years. He was set to detonate when gasoline prices hit $2 a gallon. "At first, we thought it would happen during the gasoline shortage in the 1970s, and then again during the Gulf War in the 1990s," says the agent. "It never happened, so we just forgot about poor Ralph. "It's too late to turn back now, though Nader will crush the America you know and you will all have a taste of Socialism." Sources close to Nader dismiss the whole brainwashing scenario, but concede that the presidential hopeful has been making bold statements about his plans to end the current gas crisis. "He's been talking about prohibiting driving at speeds over 25 mph and jailing owners of Hummers and SUVs," says an unnamed source in Nader's camp. "He also wants to make driving illegal on Sundays and holidays, period. "Come to think of it, he's always had strong opinions, but these radical proposals do seem to be a more recent development."

       urlLink By Joal Ryan    Rick James lived the rock 'n' roll life to excess--right up until he faced a life sentence in prison.  The influential but troubled funkmeister, known for his 1981 hit "Super Freak (Part 1)" and a two-year stint in prison on cocaine-fueled assaults, was found dead of apparent natural causes at 9:45 a.m. Friday morning in his Los Angeles home. He was 56. The rocker and producer had been busy of late, working on a new album, and an autobiography to be called Memoirs of a Super Freak. Comic Dave Chappelle was in talks to portray James in a planned biopic based on the book, the Hollywood Reporter said in June.  Last month, James told BET.com that the new album would feature as many as 30 songs.  "Music is a universal language, every color, every creed, every race," James told the Website. "I want everybody to enjoy my [stuff]."  In June, he was presented with ASCAP's Rhythm & Soul Heritage Award, credited by the organization for being the father of "punk-funk" in hits such as "Mary Jane," "Give It to Me Baby" and his signature tune, "Super Freak."  In 1998, James suffered a stroke, which his management blamed on "rock 'n' roll neck," or blood vessels weakened as the result of too much neck-bobbing during shows.  That year James also underwent hip-replacement surgery. That injury was blamed on years of performing--as well as years of substance abuse.  It was cocaine that landed James in his most serious trouble.  In 1991, he was arrested for singeing a woman with a hot crack pipe. In 1992, while out on bail, he was arrested for beating up another woman at a West Hollywood hotel.  In 1993, he was convicted of assault in the two arrests, but he was cleared of a torture charge in the crack-pipe incident that could have put him behind bars for the rest of his life.  Born Feb. 1, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, James' other hits include "You and I" and "Mary Jane."

      or that you could crawl into a hole? Here are the testimonials of a few people who did.....   I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and asked loudly, "How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?" I turned around and walked back out and never went back. My husband didn't say a word... he knew better.   I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I was unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After browsing for several minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who works at the store. He asked if he could help me. Without thinking, I looked at him and said, "I think I like playing with men's balls."   My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a variety of candy and nuts . As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the counter asked if we needed any help. I replied, "No, I'm just looking at your nuts." My sister started to laugh hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away. To this day, my sister has never let me forget.    Have you ever asked your child a question too many times? My three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training and I was on him constantly One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter, and she was clean. Then I realized that Danny had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked him if he needed to go, and he said "No." I kept thinking, "Oh Lord, that child has had an accident, and I don't have any clothes with me." Then I said, "Danny, are you SURE you didn't have an accident?" "No," he replied. I just KNEW that he must have had an accident, because the smell was getting worse. Soooooo, I asked one more time, "Danny, did you have an accident?" This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled. "SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!!" While 30 people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing! He calmly pulled up his pants and sat down An old couple made m e feel better by thanking me for the best laugh they'd ever had!   This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think before she speaks. What happens when you predict snow but don't get any....a true story.. We had a female news anchor who, the day after it was supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked: "So Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?" Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too they were laughing so hard!

       urlLink    This statue currently stands outside the Iraqi palace, now home to the 4th Infantry division. It will eventually be shipped home and put in the memorial museum in Fort Hood, Texas.   The statue was created by an Iraqi artist named Kalat, who for years was forced by Saddam Hussein to make the many hundreds of bronze busts of Saddam that dotted Baghdad.   Kalat was so grateful for the Americans liberation of his country; he melted 3 of the heads of the fallen Saddam and made the statue as a memorial to the American soldiers and their fallen warriors. Kalat worked on this memorial night and day for several months.   To the left of the kneeling soldier is a small Iraqi girl giving the soldier comfort as he mourns the loss of his comrade in arms.   Do you know why we don't hear about this in the news? Because it is heart warming and praise worthy. The media avoids it because it does not have the shock effect that a flashed breast or controversy of politics does. But we can do something about it. We can pass this along to as many people as we can in honor of all our brave military making a difference.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink DAVENPORT, Iowa (Reuters)  - Figuring Davenport police were preoccupied with simultaneous visits by President Bush and Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry, three bank robbers went to work on Wednesday, police said.  Police on foot chased down the suspect in the first robbery, which occurred just about when Bush was stepping off his plane.  The second and third robberies at different banks took place while the two candidates were addressing their respective crowds -- which was almost certainly factored into the thieves' thinking, police Lt. Don Gano said.  "Without actually talking to the bad guys, that's probably what happened," Gano said of the robbers' timing.  When police answered the first call, it further thinned their ranks, Gano said.  Police were hunting for the other two suspects, who were both armed. They did not believe any of the suspects were aware of the others' plans.

      In fact, even those of us who aren't consciously dieting are putting ourselves on miniature diets every day. Most of us keep our bodies in survival mode most of the time: For example, one in five of us skip breakfast every morning, according to a 2003 study, and we probably think we're doing something healthy - less food, less fat, right?  But in truth, people who skip breakfast are 450% more likely to be overweight or obese. They are training their bodies to store fat, the way you are if you skip meals regularly. We're also training our bodies to store the most dangerous fat - abdominal fat. This fat isn't a static cluster of useless tissue. It's a living, growing mass, practically an organism all its own, one that builds, divides and excretes toxins back into our systems, that draws blood flow and nutrients away from the rest of our bodies, that alters the distribution of hormones in our bloodstreams, that presses on our organs and hampers their function. Studies show that men and women who have high levels of abdominal fat - as opposed to those who have fat more evenly distributed - are at greater risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and even some forms of cancer. The shocking truth about America's obesity problem is that we're fat because we're starving. The best way to make yourself fat is to let yourself get hungry. And we live in a nation of people who are hungry all of the time. Read the whole article here...  urlLink Why diets should be history

       urlLink    The official Bush Cheney 04 Event Pack. We will be receiving this in Baghdad so we can support our man. My parents will also be receiving two yard signs to put in their front yard. This is kind of a tradition, that goes back a few elections (before I could even vote) I had a boyfriend who was a huge George Senior supporter and he put a sign in our yard. Meanwhile, my dad was for Ross Perot (yes, do not ask! Let's just hope he does not vote for Nader in this election!) He found a sign for Perot in someone's yard and decided to borrow it and put it in his. Well, that did not last because someone decided to borrow the sign from our yard a few nights later. No one touched the Bush sign... Wonder what will happen this year? It better not involve anyone who lives in my parent's house taking or defacing my signs!&nbsp; urlLink
