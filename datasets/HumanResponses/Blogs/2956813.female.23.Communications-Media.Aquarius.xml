      A SLIPPER!!  Do I really look like a slipper?!?!  These shoes are horrid!  Why can't I be a flip-flop or a high-heel?!?!  The least these people could do was put a pic of cute pink fuzzy slippers on the pic...WHY ME?!?!   Slippers- happy, sweet, and adorable, you are well loved by everyone.  People cannot help but like you.  You love to be surrounded by people that love you, who- in your case- is anyone. [please vote! thank you! :)]     urlLink   What Kind of Shoe Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    By the way, I'm really not done with men. I just needed to vent and all you peeps were in Cali

      Stick a fork in me I'm done!  Done with guys anyways.  I love my guy friends, don't get me wrong, but as far a dating I'm through.  After this last guy, I don't know how much more I can take.  Non-ambitious men who aren't spiritual grounded.  Then I'm the bad guy becuase I don't want to date them.  Ahhhh.  I'm in this giant catch 22.  For all the single women out there...this is for you.  Be true to yourself!  Don't settle for anybody just to have someone.  Patience is a virtue right?  (I'm still working on that one)  Find someone who compliments you...not complicates you.  I feel like the pot calling the kettle black, but this is something I'm learning and feel I should share.  "Stick it to the man"

      With the help of Jeremy...I now have a cool blog.  Or at least I think so...anybody who doesn't can kiss my hibiscus.  haha.  Well it's Wednesday and I don't have anything going on, but I am getting a couch today.  See when you're old like me, getting a couch is reason enough to throw a party.  It's about the most excitment I've had this week.  Everyone have a great Wednesday...I'm off to get my couch.  I will write more later....Love you all

      Hate crimes:   As a couple of you know, I was called into work a little earlier than usual today.  I got a call right after church from our photographer saying the Islamic Mosque has been vandalized.  So, duty called.  When we showed up the Imam (preacher) of the church and some men of the mosque showed us around.  The sanctuary had been broken into, they completly ransacked the imam's office, wrote the most terrible things on the walls and took money out of their charity box.  It was so horrible.  I don't understand what possess people to do such things.  It was so obvious that this was not just a prank, but a hate crime against the Muslims.  One man actually spoke to me about the comparisons of Christianity and Islam.   They were the nicest people and I feel it's a trajedy what happened to them today because it shouldn't have happened at all.  Why must people be so hateful and ignorant to cultural diversity??  The Imam left me with one thought..."may god forgive them b/c they don't know what they are doing."  The same thing Jesus said on the cross....  See my story and more tonight at nine

      Last night I had the pleasure of sharing some of my war stories with some beautiful young ladies, and I discovered something...I really am a magnet for strange men.  Don't laugh...it's true...ask the girls.  Only I pick up men who are wardrobe challenged...only I find men who actually 'use' pick up lines...and only I attract men with tear duct issues.  So, looking back on the pleathora of dates I've had in my 23 years on this planet and I come to one conclusion...I'm doomed.  If I had a quarter for every time a guy said to me, "you'll never find anyone like me."   "darn skippy I won't...weirdo!"  This takes me back to another 'incident' I had with a young man.   The scene of the crime:  random house   Time of day:  nightime Boys name:  of course...it started with a 'J'  I just met the guy and all of the sudden he gets this look on his face.  I couldn't figure out if he was having a seizure or giving me a James Bond face.  Without warning he drops a line on me. And I quote...     "Are you wearing lip gloss??"     "Yes."     "I bet it tastes good."     "huh?"     "Your lip gloss looks tasty."     "Yep."  I walked away at this point.  WHY ME?  I thought I was in the twilight zone.  What guy in his right mind asks a girl about her lip gloss?  Freak!    I think he was epileptic.

      I'm still trying to learn how to use this thing, so bear with me.  But I was able to find the comments stuff...yeah me.  I go with my bad self.  I have a confession.  As many of you know, I'm hooked on reality shows.  I know their trashy, but when you don't have anything to do, the Apprentise is entertaining.  I've learned a lot from ol' DT..Donald Trump.  He's taught me that I can fire people.  Yep, don't laugh...I can fire people.  I'm thinking the next time I have a bad date or a bad relationship, and it's time for it to end.  I will simply look at him square in the eyes and say...'You're Fired'.  On a different note, I saw the Passion film last night.  It was good, but a little too bloody for my taste.  I know crucifixitions weren't pretty, but ewwwww.  But the movie does remind us of one thing, rememeber that Jesus died on the cross for our sins.  Yours, mine, and everyone....

      I title my first entry...'Trust me I'm a lawyer'   Okay so I agree to go out with this guy...We'll call him Herman. I've been out with this guy once before, but nothing could possibly prepare me for what happened on the second date.   Everything *started* out fine. He shows up with brown pants and a brown vintage sweater. Under the sweater is a blue pearl snap shirt which the collar is ever so strategically flipped out over the sweater. Things were going great until we walked out to the car and he didn't open the door for me..dun dun dun...I knew I was in for a long night.   So, we go to Chili's...number 2 on the date killer restaurant list behind Cheddar's. We finally sit down, order, chit-chat, and when the food comes I'm so relieved b/c I'm starving like a small Ethiopian child...I still can't spell.   Well he spills something on himself. I'm thinking 'no biggy he has a shirt on under his sweater..remember the pearl snap?? So he takes off the sweater.   But low and behold there is a secret shirt over the pearl snap. One you would never suspect.   I look up and there it was in all it's glory. I could never have prepared myself for what was about to happen. Over the pearl snap was a black child-size fitted t-shirt with a giant shark on it. And it big white and red letters, the shirt reads.."Trust me I'm a lawyer."   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...that's what my mind was screaming at me. I was horrified.  Herman, in all his spleandor proudly displayed the child's tee for all of Chili's to see. Usually, I don't care, but remember he has on black converses, brown pants, a blue cowboy pearl snap with a giant shark shirt over it, and to top it all off...I left this part out....a mohawk!!!   We never went out again. Now, needless to say, nobody can say Emily's Herman ever became...'her man'.

      I've come to the conclusion that I'm doomed.  I've had one heck of a week.  First, I work..then off...then work...then off...then work and work and work...It would be way to easy to actually let me have consecutive days off.  oh yeah and my date...the story of chris and his amazing super spit  Then on my first day off, I get lasered.  See I'm doing this laswer treatment for my acne scars.  Well the girl 'kicked it up a notch' and now I look like small asian children pinched my face until I got tiny little bruises.  Then I've pulled stories out of butt...grrrr and I'm still working a million days a week and not getting paid.  Guys and girls...I leave you with this..."If you get spit on in the beginning of the week...the rest of your week won't get much better.

      Add this to the Emily Chronicles.  So I'm talking with an ex-bf of mine.  We're still "friends" for what it's worth.  But we're just talking.  During the middle of the coversation he makes this sounds...sort of like a sealion with a sinue problem.  It's coming from the depths of his nasal cavity.  You hear it rumbling around in his sinuses...then that's followed by this grunting noise (again like a sick sealion).  His nostrils flair, and then it came out.  In all its glory, a heaping ball of snot.  By this point, I'm running down the hall...far far away from this monstrosity.  Again, I'm thinking to myself....why me??

      Word ya'll!!    While all of you guys had a cool Saturday night...I sat at the elections office calling back to the station with election numbers....whoo whoo.  Go ahead and be jelous of me, I know you all wanted to do it too!  NOT.  Well, my job was to call our AM radio station and relay numbers and totals to them...LIVE on the air.  So I call in and I hear our announcer/my old boss say...'Live at the election office downtown is fox34's Emily JONES!!  EMILY JONES!  WHAT?!?!  Are you kidding me?!?!  They man who I've known for 3 years just called me Emily Jones...ON THE AIR!  Arggg!  Once again, I know where I rank around here.  I rank with the intern...and they can't remember my name.  I feel oh so important.  And sorry to disappoint everyone but no good stories for the week...Wait till I get a date...but don't hold your breath.

      Yes people I have 2 blogs for the day... Here is another chapter in the dating life of Emily Leonard... (Disclaimer...For the protection of the loser I'm about to describe, fake names will be used.)  So I went to daybreak to get away from it ALL.  Meaning work and people I actually know.  No offense but I needed some 'me' time.  To reflect and ponder life's ultimate questions..."why do people where Hawaiian shirts?"  I walk in...Glamour mag in hand...ready to read how I can improve the sex life that I don't have, when I spot him.  Dun dun DUN!!! Another idiot boy from my past.  I go to sit down when he spots me.  We make small talk...How's school? the weather?  my crappy job?  When his buddy..we'll call him Gomer...butts into the conversion.  "Hi I'm Gomer"  Ultimatley trying to impress me with big words like "microbiology", (you know b/c I'm just a dumb girl...he thinks) Gomer man handles his own friend to talk to me.  After it was all said and done, he says "hey we're gonna head to my apt and have some beers wanna come?" To which I respond..."I dunno."  I finally sit down at a table nearby and open my mag to discover how I can remove zits using a chisel and duct tape...the McGuiver(sp) of beauty tips right?  Then buddy number 3 walks in and sits down with them.  MInd you they are supposed to studying.  Well in the middle of the article "Size does matter", I hear them talking about some guy that was in the bathroom and all they could hear was farting noises coming from the potty.  THEN they proceed to make the farting noises...in the middle of daybreak!  Farting noises stopped being funny in the third grade!!!  WOW...I guess Gomer did come from Mayberry.

      I know I know...it's been a while sine I blogged last, but A LOT has been going on.  First of all, I'm still working about thousand times a week, but I'm still not full-time.  I hate my job...so I've been looking for a new one.  I had one interview last week, but still haven't heard anything...go figure.  I'll answer all questions upon request.  Then of course there is the men issues.  One is still trying to creep back, and I'm such a nice person I can't get him to go away.  Then another pops up again...I swear they are like weeds.  You can spray them with Roundup and they still keep coming back!!  Decent, ambitious, smart, good-looking, Christian men are either gay, taken, or Morman.   ARGGGGG!!!!  Well I have to go record news for the radio...yeah I'm been working on my days off...go me  Love you all, Em

      I'm tired. I'm exhausted...emotionally drained and physically weary.  I'm going to bear my soul, so if you don't want to read on...stop now, I'll understand.  I am a 23 year old woman with great friends, a great God, and bad luck. Today, has been hell.  My boss is out of town and everything I touch seems to turn to coal. Overall, my life isn't that bad. But, I'm tired of dealing with the crap.  I know it's inevitable, but it seems to happen a lot.  There's a guy involved, actually multiple ones...of course. They are the root of all evil.  They might read this, they might not.  Either way, you know who you are.  First, there is the ex-bf who makes me feel like crap.  He can't get over me, or at least that's what he says. Every time I speak to him, he makes me feel bad. But no more.  I don't deserve that.  Then there is the other guy.  I've had such a crush on this guy for so long.  He finally turns up single, but basically just wants to be friends with benefits. I'm better than that and won't reduce myself to being 'that' girl.     He's stuck on the way his ex-gf treated him. I'm not his ex-gf nor will I ever be.  Maybe he isn't ready to move on...and that's fine...but don't lead me on and DON'T play games with me, because I will win.     He likes to call me when it's convenient for him. We haven't actually 'talked' about 'us' but he could at least let me know what the hell is going through his head.        He's about to miss his chance.  He's about to miss out on a great girl.  Then there is my new crush...who probably doesn't know I exist.  Well he does, but just hasn't realized I've noticed him.   Men...you can't live with them and you can't shoot them.

      Nothing Clashes With Sexy  And today, I was almost sexy.  I woke up this morning reallllly late.  So I tossed on my makeup, slicked back my hair, and threw on some clothes.    I almost forgot my bra...again.  I don't know what is going on and why I can't seem to remember my bra, but at least this time I caught it before I got to work.  Geez!

      "Tales of the Datless Wonder"  Episode 1:  Nothing Clashes With Sexy  Everyday of my life is an episode of Sex and the City;just minus the sex.  If you have ever seen the show, you know the four women all have very different and distinct personalities; a representation and characteristic of every woman.  Every woman is a combination of the four:  so in a nutshell all women are sweet, ambitious, smart, sex goddesses. (keep that in mind)  Yesterday, I go to work.  My boss tells me I look like Molly Ringwald (I get this all the time) except he keeps saying Ringworm instead.  So, all day, he calls me Ringworm.  It was quite comical. I keep telling myself that she gets the hot guy in the end.  Then later, I get home and there is a message on my machine that says, my father is ready for viewing.  I call home; Dad is still alive.  But it is not everyday a funeral home calls me.  Then, I go shopping...the highlight of my afternoon.  Nothing makes me happier than buying cheap jewelry that I know some 10 year old Asian kid assembled.  While shopping, a friend calls me to come over and eat dinner.  Of course I go!  Never turn down good free food.  I get there; dressed in my t-shirt and Tech shorts; sporting my fresh purple/green/chartreuse bruise that I got from God knows where.  (It looks like I got beat).  My hair is a mess and my make-up has pretty much slid off my face.  And of course, I walk in and there is an oober-cute guy sitting there in his dress clothes b/c he just got off work.  Dress shirt, slacks, brown leather shoes.  (You guys know how I like men in dress clothes)    And there I was in all my glory.  I might as well have been barefoot with a baby on my hip.  B/c I was white trash!    It is no guess as to why I am the Dateless Wonder.

      AAHHAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!   Men! Nuff said right? They are all pissing me off to no end. You know I joke about the majority of my friends being male, and that's not a bad thing, it's just that the male species is driving me nuts!   So my ex-bf calls me. Things are so bizarre. I can tell you guys these things...you're my friends. He's a sweet guy, but he just has that knack of making me feel like a real bitch. Sometimes I know he does it intentionally but for the majority of the time, he doesn't. I just hate break-ups and the whole weirdness afterwards.   Dating sucks! You get used to having someone around...then *poof* they're gone. Once you finally get used to not having anyone around again...another pops up and it starts all over.  It's a vicious cycle! Literally, it's a jungle out there.   I know it sounds sooooo conceited of me to say but I consider myself to be a great catch. (of course what girl doesn't) But seriously, I think I am going to start conducting interviews. If a guy wants to go out with me, they have to fill out an application, which I will create myself. In return, they get a stats sheet on me. It's only fair, right?   Okay, so maybe that's not feesible, but at the rate I'm going, this is what it's going to take. I mean come on, I'm a rolodex of bad date stories...and I can't throw a rock in this town without hitting at least one person I've dated or at least kissed.(oops!)   I'm the dateless wonder. Maybe that should be the name of my book..."Tales of the Dateless Wonder"

      It has been a hell of a week.  But great!  I've chased a goat, worn a hairnet, rubbed elbows with Lubbock's most powerful men and women AND managed to get enough free samples of fried pies for the entire office.  Not to mention I've dressed provocitively and I'm still single.  But life is good. I even got to rub it in to my old boss about my new job.  My new boss even rubbed it in that Fox's loss was his gain!  hahaha  I shouldn't say that.  Even the girl Fox offered my job to turned them down.  See people don't want that job...it sucks!  Well I'm off to my weekend....

      "The Tale of Emily Leonard: Goat Hunter" and no I'm not 'kidding'  Things like this only happen to me.  So, there is this baby dwarf goat named Gypsy who belongs to a landscaper here in town.  Andrea, the landscaper, does lawn maintence for American State Bank...one of my clients I do PR for.  Every Monday, I have a meeting with ASB.  Yesterday, the ASB rep says to me, "You should have the tv stations do a piece on this goat."  See the goat was abandoned by her mother, so Andrea is raising it.  Gypsy eats weeds and mows the grass while Andrea works in the flower beds.  Me and my father have seen this goat everywhere...even the Sprint PCS store.  So I talk to my boss and say, "hey what about a pr release on the goat that mows ASB's lawn?"  "Sure", he says.  So we call Channel 11 and tell them about it, I write up a release and we send it to 11. Well, I used to work at Fox and 11 is no different...MORONS!  They call me and ask me, "where's the goat?"  The idiot photogher can't find it.  IT'S A WHITE GOAT IN A FLOWER BED IN LUBBOCK, TX, HOW DO YOU MISS THIS????  So, I went to the bank, scoured the wall between our offices, and when goat hunting in my 'provocitve' dress clothes.  Low and behold...I found the goat!!  Exactly, where I said it was.  My boss was laughing at me.  And when I returned from an errand I found a picture of "goat boy from SNL' on my computer with the words..."Emmy..Ge-e-e-e-e Thanks for the Gr-r-r-r-reat coverage...Let's hang out!  Your Goat Boy"  I haven't even been here a week and they're already making fun of me!

      I had the worst experience yesterday AT CHURCH!!  To make and incredibly LONG story short.  This random girl pulls me aside to tell me that I dress too provocatively.  My shirts are too low-cut and revealing.  I was horrified.  Never before in my life have I had anyone, especially a person in my sunday school class, tell me something like that.  She said we need to protect our guys from lustful thoughts.  PROTECT GROWN MEN?  Are you kidding me?  If they can't control their thoughts that's their problem.  Guys can get off if the girl is wearing a t-shirt and sweat pants!  Holding myself to a high standard and being the lady I am, I said nothing to her.  I was not going to stoop to her level.  And the thing that really got me was that she isn't even a leader in the class.  Plus, I'm still a vistor....it's like she's trying to run me off!  How un-Christian and rude is that?!?!  Well any of you who know me, know that I'm sticking to my guns and I'll dress the way I want to because I personally think I'm a good dresser.  I'm NOT trying to pick up any guys in the class...I'm being myself...CLASSY     ARG!  So next week...it's a turtle-neck and a really short skirt!

      Title:   "I Need Support" Date:    8 am (too early to function)      So, I get up this morning at 7 am.  For the last 23 years of my life, I had no idea people actually got up at this time, much less did I know the time actually existed.  I tumble out of bed, stumble to the kitchen, pour myself a cup of ambitition (sound like a Dolly Parton song?).    I manage to smear makeup on and cover up the bags under my eyes.  I slept in a fashion on chimps in Africa are familiar with so my back hurts.  I'm stooped over my bathroom counter fighting with my mascara.  Finish that...and move on to the mane I have sitting on my head.  I work it into a style similiar to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and go to my closet.  There I find a dress, put it on, find some shoes and run out the door.  Cursing at my 'too hot to drink coffee' I fight traffic to work.  People drive at 8 am...freaks.  I get to work, sit down at my computer and it happens.   In the midst of my sleep walking/getting ready for work, I realize I hadn't finished getting ready.  I FORGOT MY BRA!! I think the last time I did that I was in the 3rd grade or something, but back then...it didn't matter.  Nowadays...it does!  Need I remind you, this is only my 3rd day at work.  I make an excuse that I had an "errand" to run and dash home, find my bra, put it on, and run out the house.  On my way back, I was thinking to myself...why me??  If I were a free balling feminist it would have been okay...but I'm not. I like my breasts to be contained.

       Panties and Prayers    After work yesterday, I decided to make a pit stop by Mardel (that's with no 's').&nbsp; I've never been one to read devotional books...but here lately, I've felt God telling me to "dive in."   So, I go to the book section of Mardel.&nbsp; The book section is like a Monet painting...from far away it's bold and simple, but up close, it's a scrambling mess of a million books.&nbsp; I had no idea there were so many!   I looked&nbsp;like&nbsp;a man in Victoria's Secret...lost!&nbsp; And just like a man, too stubborn to ask for directions.&nbsp; I meander up and down the aisles (that's with and 's'), looking at the different categories of books.&nbsp; Finally, I see the word 'Women'.&nbsp; Ahhhh, (sung like the angels above) I had found my meca!&nbsp; But up close, it was a collage of self-helps and married books.&nbsp; I'm not married nor depressed.&nbsp;   See, to a man, Victoria's Secreat is a sea of lace and push-ups.&nbsp; Too many choices.&nbsp; Size, color, push-ups, push-downs, and not to mention ride-ups.&nbsp; Not that I am comparing God to underwear, but that's how lost I felt.&nbsp; I&nbsp; feel like I've stumbled into territory I don't know much about.&nbsp; I have a lot to learn.   I was pretty discouraged.&nbsp; I kept praying that God would just make one of the books jump off the shelf at me!&nbsp; That didn't happen of course.&nbsp; So, in defeat, I went home.&nbsp;   But I refuse to give up! The man who just stands outside of Victoria's Secret staring into the uncharted territory of women's lingere will eventually one day go inside.&nbsp; And, I too will eventually go into the Mardel book section!   &nbsp;

          Flowers and Chocolates Won't Do the Trick      Last night was church night.&nbsp; We're studying the Song of Solomon.&nbsp; Something really hit me in the head.&nbsp;   When dating, communication is a big key...duh!&nbsp; But in that communication is sharing your past.&nbsp; We're all not proud of something that we've done in the past.&nbsp; But forgiving yourself is hard.&nbsp; AND, you're scared if you tell the person you are dating because you think&nbsp;they'll run for hills.  Well if they run, it wasn't mean to be and you don't need 'em!&nbsp; They have to forgive you. But more importantly, you have to forgive you and you're ex. (that last part is key)  To me, having a soft heart includes having the ability to forgive.&nbsp; God has really hit me with this one.&nbsp; Not to wine or complain, but I've been hurt, verabally abused, and used.&nbsp; But part of healing is forgiving.&nbsp; Now, some of these particular boys could fall off the planet and I wouldn't care, but forgiving them for being morons is different.&nbsp;   It's hard to forgive someone who has hurt you.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I think it's necessary.&nbsp; Why? To truly forgive someone is to truly move on...giving you a sense of peace.&nbsp; Jesus forgives us...and we should strive to be Christ-like...and to be Christ-like is to forgive.  So, even though you think he/she is a blazing idiot who deserves to be put in front of a firing squad...Just remember you don't need them anyways...so forgive 'em and forget 'em!

       Stars, Mars, and God Winks...   Last night, God was tugging at me...like a small gnome with a red pointy hat.&nbsp; I tried to ignore it because I was watching tv...yeah&nbsp;I'm a dork and listening to the flesh.&nbsp; Finally, I got so perturbed that I sat down and opened my Bible for my quiet time.&nbsp; So much for watching Leno!  I've read Matthew 6 like a thousand times, but something new jumped out at me.&nbsp; "Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?"&nbsp; So, I'm a worry wart...and boy God hit me with this one.&nbsp;   When we are little, we wish on stars.&nbsp; Even to this day, most of us look to the stars for wishing...especially those shooting stars!&nbsp; It's the hope that one day our wishes and dreams will come true.&nbsp; As grown-ups...and I use that term losely...wishing on stars seem silly, but we still do it.&nbsp; But why?  Stars are God's creation.&nbsp; But, we wish on them because we can see them.&nbsp; God isn't tangible...this is where our faith plays a role. So, last night, God told me to stop worrying and wishing on stars...that won't fix the problem.&nbsp; Start praying...stop worrying and wishing.  God is kinda like Mars.&nbsp; He's the brighest star.&nbsp; All the other stars are dull compared to Mars.&nbsp; It's bright and warm...just like our Lord.&nbsp; It twinkles...like winks...God winks.  I still look up...in awe of God's glorious creation.&nbsp; But, I remember that His most glorious creation is us and we must turn to Him and wait for winks upon us...not the stars and&nbsp;not Mars.

       urlLink    Smells Good!!  God Wink - Godwinks, like a wink from Dad or Grandma that said, "Hey kid, I'm thinking of you right now," are little signposts from above reminding you that you are always on a sort-of Global Positioning System. You're never alone.   That's a God Wink. All the times you say, "what a coincidence" or "what are the odds of that" or "there is a reason for this"   Godwinks are silent messages from the universe, quiet communications that support and reassure us. Little miracles in themselves, godwinks are those amazing coincidences that shape our lives.   That's why I titled this God Winks. I'm reading a book by SQuire Rushnell with the same title. It has made me more aware of why people, things, places, etc are in my life...that everything happens for a reason.   So there is my explanation... straight from the author's mouth. Think about all the things that happen to you and why they happened...it really makes you realize how God is in control all the time!!    &nbsp; urlLink

      The Word 'Used' Should Only Be Reserved for Cars!  A guy friend of mine always jokes that he will end up the subject of one of my blogs.&nbsp; Well here it is.  So this 'guy' breaks up with his girlfriend that he so lovingly calls psycho *itch.&nbsp; He tells me how he wants a Woman of God who is seeking God's will...thus seek it together.&nbsp; He knows how I feel about him b/c I've told him.&nbsp; So, what does he do??&nbsp; He uses it against me.  Unknowingly, I become his friend with benefits, makeout buddy, his friday fling, his rebound.&nbsp; Pick your poison.  So, he's back with the ex...of course.&nbsp; Because he's a spineless jellyfish and doesn't know what he wants.&nbsp; Ya know once God tells you something...he doesn't change His mind or take it back.  So, I got used.&nbsp; Not like a car.&nbsp; I've still got lots of miles left on me, my shocks are still good, and trust me, my paint job is beautiful!!

      Emily Update...My Life As of Late  As you may have noticed, I changed my blog.&nbsp; Green...such a soothing color.&nbsp;   So the last week or so has been nothing but drama.&nbsp; I hate drama.&nbsp; I won't go into too much detail, but let's just say I graduated from high school a long time ago and I'm not going back.&nbsp; And of course, there is a boy invovled. You boys are trouble!  But that's not the biggest thing going on.&nbsp; God is teaching me a lot....about a lot.&nbsp; It's exciting.&nbsp; And as you all know the devil likes to crap on your parade...so I'm dealing with him as well.  I don't have any good dating stories.&nbsp; I had one date not too long ago and he showed up wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Luckily, it was a joke. He just wanted to see what I would do.&nbsp; It was really funny.&nbsp; But he's just a friend.  Actually, things are kinda dull....for once. Just give me time!

      Clueless.  One single word to describe the single man. Sex.  One single word to describe what is on the single mans mind. 		 You know the word single is such a crappy word.  According to my buddy Webster, single means solitary.  Solitary?  Solitary means being alone, remote or lonely.   This makes no sense to me.  I am not alone.  I am not a hermit living in the mountains, eating bugs and living by myself.  I am not lonely.  My point is, experts have it all wrong. People who are single, for the most part, are not remote homebodies. Implying that we must have someone to be whole.  The idea that two heads are better than one.  Why does the word one or single have such a negative connotation??  Why do people feel you are not complete if you are not with someone.  I am taking it upon myself to scour the world in search of a new word for single.  Like independent. Definition:  free from the influence or control of others; self-governing; self-reliant.  I like that.   From now on, I am not single. I am independent!!!  (Written in the spirit of our nationss independence and mine too. Happy 4th of July)

       Let's Talk About Sex Baby   Here is your post-Wednesday report...brought to you by yours truly and the makers of Silly Putty.  So last night was church night...Song of Solomon: The Art of Intimacy.  Yep.  Nothing like watching a bunch of Baptists in church talk about sex. It's like watching a bunch of wiggly worms.  Quite a site!  No one actually wants to say anything. Being taught sex is a no-no before marriage, it's hard to talk about. But it's everywhere!  As the slogan goes, "Sex Sells."   Christians tend to think sex is a dirty thing.  Once married, it's a beautiful thing (from what married people tell me). Last night, we were told that sex is a gift from God used to consumate your marriage and show love to the other.  (ahhh marriage...true love...say it like Elmer Fudd)  But now-a-days, sex is all over the place and many people have become numb to it.  It's not big deal.  No big deal??!?!?! Are you kidding me?? Sex is the most intimate thing you can do.  It's a physical act of love...true love.   As a Christian, I personally feel that sex is something we should talk about.  I think we should wait...though we all know it's so easy to give into our lust. If schools, parents, and churches would actually talk about it, our STD and teen pregnancy rates would be lower. Plus, we might actually understand the opposite sex a little better.  Since men and women are wired so differently (no pun intended), will we ever truly understand each other.  Men use romance to get sex...women use sex to get romance.  Think about it.

       Frog Squishing   How many frogs to I have to kiss before I find my prince??  I'm about to start dissecting frogs or cooking up some frog legs!  No more kissing slimy green frogs! You know after it rains and there are so many frogs on the road you can't avoid squishing them with your tires?  I wish I could do that with all the frogs I've dated!  I'm a Hawaiian and Trust me I'm a lawyer shirt wearing, not educated, "I don't know what I want", pick-up line using, snot hurling, Butthead laughing, makeup removing with spit, ignorant loser magnet!!  I try to be so strong and independent, but I will be very honest with you.  I'm tired of being single.  I just figured something out...the word single actually has my initials in it!!!  It's a sign!!   I know my dating stories are funny and I enjoy telling them, but it kinda hurts.  I mean, it seems like my dating life IS a joke.  I'm 23 and my longest relationship was 3 months!  In some ways that's a good thing, because if it's not meant to be then I haven't wasted a whole lot of time.  But, on the other hand, it's almost as if I'm a commitmentphobe. (I'm not)  I know God has someone and I know He will allow us to meet with the time is right, but really!   Right now, I'm having to deal with a boy who keeps telling me "I don't know what I want."  Pooey!  But, here's the problem.  My defense mechanism has gone up, which means I'm about to get very tacky with him.   See, my natural instinct when I know I'm about to get hurt is to become mean; thus helping me distance myself from them...aka I don't get attached because I have it in my mind that I hate them for some reason.  Sounds strange, I know.  But, if he doesn't have the juevos enough to tell me that he doesn't want to date me...well then maybe he deserves my wrath.  Okay, maybe not.   I'm just tired of it all.  So far this week I've had contact with three of the four guys I've dated this year, and all of them have NOT been positive.    Remember that dating application I had...well it's about to tweekend and put into use! Stay Tuned!

       Never Question A Woman's Intuition   I love the fact men think women are stupid.  Women are small intricate objects with a keen sense wit and intuition.  Like a tiger we sense danger.  Okay, so my life is a little like "The Crocodile Hunter." Danger, Danger, Danger!  So, I know this boy is back with his ex-gf.  Apparently, I was his 'in between' girl.  But, he lies to me and tells me that they are friends again and talking. I just laughed to myself because I know otherwise.  I could have said something, but I didn't.  I just pray that someone or something would knock some sense into him.  My instincts are to rip him to shreads! Sink my teeth into him and let him have it!  He used me and I want him to suffere!  But, I took the high road. I figure it's better to let him dig his own grave. But, my tiger sense tells me to hunker down and watch. Plus, he's nothing but a small rabbit.  Who wants to waste their time and energy for something that is simply not worth it in the long run.  This leads into dating someone for the right reasons. You want something that is worth it.  Worth the hunt! If you are patient enough and keep your eyes peeled, the right guy will come along and you can pounce on him!  Okay Okay, so enough with the tiger analogy. This is a word of warning boys, don't mess with women. Women have an intuition that is undescribable and you'll never comprehend it!! We don't even know what it is or how it works.

       Sin-gle   Hello. My name is Emily and I'm single (insert crowd..."Hi Emily").  Why does the word 'single' have such a negative connotation? Within the Christian community, it feels like being single is a bad thing. Preaching to us about dating and marriage almost as if we aren't good enough on our own. Has anyone ever thought that the reason we are single is because we haven't found that person we want to spend the rest of our lives with?  We should be prepared for dating... Song of Solomon studies are great. But, I am not any less of a person because I don't have a boyfriend.  There is nothing wrong with single people. We aren't dumb or stupid...we just haven't found that special person. It's like being single is a handicap. I personally think it's a blessing! I can spend time with God, friends, family, take off to foreign countries when I want to, AND I'm slightly less drama free.  Even the word single itself has the word "sin" in it. The name of my Sunday School group is "Singles 2." What up with that? I'm well aware of the fact I'm single, I don't need to be reminded.  So I thought of other names for our class...(feel free to add something) "We can't get a date" class "Apparently, we're depressed and on prozac because we're single" class "We're single and have no life" class  I vote to change to name of my class and every class with the word single in it to "Young Adults" "Independents" "We don't need no stinking significant other"...class  Our motto: "Ain't no thing...ain't got no ring!" Represent!

       God, can you hear me now?   I apologize for the delay in blogs.  I had to take a business trip to Odessa, Texas (aka...Slowdeatha).  You know, I find road trips to be a great time to be with yourself and God.  But, it's also funny how much you talk on your phone because you're lonely. Not only did I run down my cell phone's battery before I even got to Odessa, I had to stop at Wal-Mart and buy a car charger.  Then a girlfriend of mine called because she was bored while she was driving home to Oklahoma...ironic.  But, one of the other phone calls was in reference to even more drama within my church group.   By definition, according to my buddy Webster, drama is..."a situation or succession of events in real life having the dramatic progression or emotional effect or characteristic of a play."  With that being said, I have diagnosed myself with drama...a disease plaguing many of us.   So, on my way home yesterday after a long day of  country clubs and yuppies...I prayed that God would just take care of my drama situation because I can't do anything about it.  Everything happens for a reason and there is a reason for the drama...not to mention everytime I try to fix it, more drama happens.  Which, is a clear indication to me that God is telling me to stop!  Letting go and letting God is a hard thing to wrap your brain around.  Having faith in someone you can't touch or see is hard.  But, things are so much easier when you do let go.   Unlike Bruce Almighty...God doesn't have email, or a blog for that matter.  I just keep telling myself, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understandings. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your path straight."  So, on my way home, after I called everyone and their garden gnomes, I thought, "God should have a cell phone." But, God does have a cell phone.  Prayer.  Think about it.  Free anytime minutes, you never lose your signal, no roaming, no dropped calls, and the battery never dies!  It's the ultimate cell phone plan...and it's free!  They say, "Call upon the Lord"...buddy I'm calling and His phone is ringing.  Now, I'm just trying to figure out what tune He uses for His ringer.

       Jesus, Mary, And A Cup o 'Jo'seph   Have you ever noticed that coffee and Christians go hand-in-hand? I'm mean really, what is the connection between the caffeinated beverage we all hold so dear to our hearts and Christianity?  Yesterday, I once again attempt the Mardel book section and this time I noticed all the weird book titles...but the ones that jumped out at me invovled coffee. Coffee?? Now, as a coffee connoisseur myself, I enjoy a nice cup 'o' joe. But it seems to me that Christians and coffee and have a connection that is a mystery to me.  So, call me Nancy Drew, but I want to uncover the mystery of ''The Bean and the Bible."  Recounting all the connections: Several church groups meet at coffee houses for their study time. Many people go to a coffee house to read (Bible, devotional, etc) Several dates end with a cup of coffee Fellowship usually takes place at a coffee house  But why? Is a Christians beer of choice coffee?? Is a coffee shop our "bar", our substitute for the smokey haze of a boot scootin' dance hall? Instead of getting tanked on barley and hopps, us Christians load up on caffiene. Watch out!! We're loaded on coffee and ready to spread the gospel!! Is it the overly stuffed couches and wireless internet that sucks us into cafe latte heaven?  Now, I'm not putting down coffee. In fact, I love it!! I can't get started in the morning without it. I'm an addict. But, where did this all start? Who do we blame for over-caffienated Christians high on the Lord?? Starbucks??  You know Mormon's don't even drink the stuff because they consider it a stimulant. Many doctors recommend that you stop drinking it for health reasons! But we do it anyways.  So, I pose this question...if coffee and Christianity are meant to be together...like peas and carrots...will there be coffee in heaven?

       Smurfs...Burn Your Bras !!   They say Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars.  I never really understood this saying.  Sure men and women are different, we're wired differently.  But, I don't think we're from different planets.  According to the Bible don't, women technically come from men? Indicating to me that we are, in fact, similar.  With this being said, you would think women would ban together.  Burn the bras!! Women's rights and equality!!  No more Betty Homemaker!!  But, that was a different generation.  Now, it seems like all women do is try and figure out men and talk about each other behind their backs.  Men are unifed.  They don't worry about other men stealing their women or who said what about them. Why can't women be like this??  To form a true community within the body of Christ, these types of things have to stop.  Key words...fellowship, trust, friendship.  Women are wired to be territorial.  We're like tigers...step into our territory and you'll be ripped to shreds! Or kinda like Smurfette...ever wondered what would have happened if another female Smurf entered the village??  Mass hysteria!!  So, lately God has really placed this on my heart. What can I do to help unify a group of tigers whose claws are sharp and senses are, well, like a tigers??  I'm slowly reaching out to different women, one at a time.  I'm letting God use me.  Because although we are caddy and mean sometimes, we have to ban together.  Who truly understands a woman??  Answer:  Another woman!  Because, who is there when a man does you wrong?  Answer: You're girlfriends!  So, ladies...burn your bras!  Just think about this...When Smurfette had an issue with another Smurf, she didn't have another woman to talk to...another woman who truly could have understood her.  Who did she have??...Papa Smurf. And although he was the wisest of the Smurfs...he was still a man!

       Men Shouldn't Wear Hawaiian Shirts...       As many of you know, I do not have the best dating experiences. In fact, my horror dating stories have become widely known. As far as the East is from the West, Emily's dating stories are well known and laughed at. Literally, I could write novel on the my do's, don'ts, and disasters in dating.  I enjoy telling my stories because I love to make people laugh, and trust me they are hilarious! But, why are my stories so funny you ask?? Because I attract losers...plain and simple. The weirdest characters ask me out. The Hawaiian shirt wearing, bad conversationalist, has to use a line to kiss me, hairest, "Trust me I'm a lawyer" t-shirt wearing men on the planet!  So, this being said...I'm waiting for that wonderful Christian leader of a man to waltz into my life. But, as soon as I think I've caught a good one...they duck and run using the excuse of "I don't know what I want"...(humm I say as I stratch my head)  To me, when a man says, "I don't know what I want"...that means, "I'm dumping you and don't have the balls to say it." Man up men!  I have God on my side, and although I'm hurting now, it's going to be better in the long run b/c I know God has someone better.  Plus, that's what I get for be attracted to another man who wears Hawaiian shirts! Oh yeah! And this one takes the cake on the gayest most homosexual Hawaiian shirt I've ever seen. Not too mention, the buttons were pulling b/c the shirt was sized to fit a 14 year old girl!
