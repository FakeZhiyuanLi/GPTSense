      I'm posting because I'm feeling guilty about not posting for a couple of days.  I get started on these huge projects that I just  know  are going to be a fun, creative outlet that will save me from the ennui that my soul is soaking in...and I never finish.  I run into some roadblock, usually illusory, and that is the end of  that , whatever  that  may have been.  This, on the other hand, is easy.  There is no real effort except to log on and type.  So, I logged on and I'm typing!  I am also logged on and typing from work.  And, I actually have things I need to do.  Therefore, responsibility to self discharged, I will return to activities I am paid to be doing.  Odd...I still feel the ennui.  So much for blog as panacea!

      Okay, so here I am with my oft-talked-about Internet presence, yippee yahoo wahoo kai yai yay.  Now just what the hell am I supposed to do?  To answer this question, I have been cheerfully surfing blogs for an hour or so.  Thus far, research has yielded the following conclusions:  1.  Blog as diary.  Only interesting if you can actually WRITE!  I personally liked urlLink  Wil Wheaton's blog .  I love the Wheatons and I wish they lived next door!  There's a real talent to making the mundane moments that light up your everyday world shimmer for other people in the retelling, and he has it. Of course, he is interesting because he is a celebrity of sorts, but I've decided I still really like the guy.   2.  Blog as news central for some esoteric interest.  Only interesting as a "Gee, that's different!" read unless you are one of the people on the planet that actually care about the effect different fonts have on the number of people that actually read the TOS or something.  3. Blog as clearing house for different news sources and commentary by the blogger.  Works if your blogger is a reasonably clear-headed thinker and writes well.  I particularly liked  urlLink Information Addict .  4.  Blog as something completely fun and different.  I had NO idea that  urlLink Retrocrush  was a blog, and I've been surfing that for a long time!  So, I can either learn to write well, come up with something off-the-wall to discuss expertly, or get really creative.  Oh, I am in serious trouble here...

      I've been saying for years that I need to put up some sort of personal website just to say I have one.  I'm not a luddite or a net neophyte.  I mean, I have been working for the same dot-com for almost five years now, fer crying out loud!  It's just that I have no idea what I would say to the world that would be at all useful or interesting.    That, and I'm old-skool-geek.  My HTML works and I can write it in Notepad, but it's not exactly going to qualify me as a programmer.  As a matter of fact, it's not going to qualify me as being able to say I really *know* HTML.  I can sorta tell what's going on if I look at Javascript.  Okay, my geek skills suck!  Let's just say it and get it out in the open right now!  What has changed, then, that I have suddenly opened this blog and added yet another bit of flotsom to the delicious yet unsavory information soup?  Nothing.  I still have no clue what it is I want to share with the world that anyone would find useful or interesting.  I'm going to be 38 years old on June 21, I have a husband and a kid and a job (I manage the banner ad delivery system for the aforementioned dot-com) and I lead the most boring life imaginable.  I'm bright enough as far as that goes, but that doesn't necessarily make me interesting.  I suspect my real problem is that I am perfectly content these days.  Happy, even.  Maybe it's just that happy people are boring people.  I wasn't always this happy, though.  I've had a long life journey that has brought me to this middle-class soccer-mom blissfully-contented life I lead now.  I was severely brutalized and abused as a child by my schizophrenic mother, spent some time in a halfway house drying out in my early 20s, and was a blithering mess for a lot of years.  Maybe that's what I want to share with the world -- who I am and what I've become and how I keep plodding along.  Yeah...there's fascinating reading material there.  Not.  I will definitely need to think about what the purpose of my shiny new blog is.  In the meantime, please feel free to offer suggestions and read whatever random thoughts pour through the keyboard until I figure out a topic.
