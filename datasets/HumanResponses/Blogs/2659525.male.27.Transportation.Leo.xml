      Well, today I saw the boy that stood me up online...  I had to ask him what had happened to him the other night.  I guess that somewhere inside I had to have the satisfaction of hearing the lie that he would inevitably make up for an excuse.  This one scored super low on originality: "I had to help my mom and I forgot to take your number with me"  And the excuse for why he didn't respond to my email that simply said "hey I sorry we didn't get to meet, just writing to make sure that you are ok... email or IM me sometime."  he told me that he doesn't know why he didn't respond, he just didn't.  I at least give him props for not wasting the time to come up with another story about how the weather slowed his internet connection and everytime he tried to send a reply to my email or IM me online, his computer froze up or something stupid like that.  Why is it that as humans we can't just be honest with one another?  There are ways of speaking the truth without being hurtful.  I have much more respect for people who, like my friend Blake, who after I told my HIV status said "thats cool" then the next day after having the evening to think about it and let it soak in, had the balls to come to me and say "I am really sorry, but after evaluating everything in my life right now, this is just not something I can do... I can't be in a relationship with someone that is poz"  I respected Blake so much for that moment of honesty.  I know that it was difficult for him to say, but he didn't want me to think it was anything about ME that he was rejecting, he was rejecting THE VIRUS.  I know that when people stand me up, or stop calling or whatever they are not rejecting me, they are rejecting the virus... Blake taught me that lesson...the virus and I are not the same thing, we just happen to come as a package deal...   I will probably post more on this whole topic soon... but this is just what was running through my head now...

      Good Morning All!!!  YAY!!! today is the last day of reserve before I start my regular line... no more changing my days off at the last minute etc... So, shortly I am off to work for a very full day of flying... Cinci to St Louis, St. Louis to NYC, NYC back to St. Louis, St. Louis to Cinci... good Lawd thats a lot of time on a plane.  So some of you know I met a boy online yesterday, and we spent most of the day chit chatting... and before you know it, he is asking me if we can meet for coffee or a cocktail or something... never being one to look a gift horse in the mouth, I of course said "I would love to"  I then followed up by saying, "in case you didn't notice in my profile or I hadn't mentioned it in our chat, you should know that I am HIV+", I was assured that it was no problem, and that he would see me at 10pm...  I chose to tell this boy in this manner to give him an easy out to save both of us any awkward moments.  Sure enough, he took it, the boy didn't show up, although I wasn't surprised, I was still disappointed... I wonder if that disappointment ever goes away, and if it goes away does that mean I have become bitter or jaded...

      So, I am going back blond... like litterally that is what I am doing as I write this.  I don't think beauty should be this painful... but let me tell ya, the bleach on my head BURNS!!!  I figured it was safe to do the whole blond thing again since I was off probation at work and the chances of me getting fired for it are pretty slim now.  Day before yesterday, in Charleston, SC, I was chatting with Andrew on the phone and watching QAF on Showtime, and after QAF was over Its My Party started... I told Andrew I couldn't watch it cuz I would get sucked in and watch the whole thing and cry and all that good shit.  So I changed the channel while I was still on the phone with him.  No sooner than I hang up from him, I decide I have to flip back to see where they are in the movie.  STUPID IDEA!!!  2 hours later I was on my bed crying like a bitch.  It is rare that a movie can do that to me... I mean I cry at movies all the time but usually when I watch them again, I pick them apart and the do nothing for me... This movie I have seen dozens of times and it is always good for a good sob... The only other movies that are like that for me are The Color Purple, The Imitation Of Life, and Steel Magnolia's.... Oh yeah, and Like Water For Chocolate....  This is however, the first time I have watched this since I got sick... I spent about 3 hours the next day examining the situation.  Could I or would I kill myself before I became a burden on my loved ones...  I decided if I were in the same situation as the character in the movie I would have done the exact same thing.  I never want to have my family and friends remember me as a vegetable, or my body so ravaged by illness that I can't take care of myself.  I want my friends and family to remember me when I am strong and mostly healthy...  I would also want a party right before I go, I want to go with all of my family (both chosen and not) around me.  I already decided Andrew will definately be my "Margaret Cho" character in the movie... she has this role of a very caring friend who doesn't like that she is losing her best friend, but is totally there to support him and help grant his final wishes... through the whole movie, she does such a good job of not crying around Nick, but at the end, she lets him know how much he has meant to her, and vice versa.  Andrew would definately be the one next to my mother weeping...  Tony would be the character played by Balki (I can never remember his real name)  He is so outgoing and abrasive but so supportive of his friend.  The other roles would be filled in by the wonderful cast of friends that I have been so blessed to have in my life.  There have been times in my life when I didn't know if I would be able to go on, when it felt like life was just too much.... it is at those times that one of my friends have stepped in and carried me out of the hole that I was in.  Anyway, that is a VERY long time off... I will post more later...

      LAWD am I tired... I just wrapped up the longest work day ever, it wound up being over 15 hours today.  The good news is that I think I am done for a couple days.  I just finished having a really nice chat with a friend about self esteem.  Its funny that I would be someone giving advice on self esteem, but I suppose that is usually the case, the preacher is too busy preaching to actually practice what he preaches.  This young man that I was chatting with is truly one of the most beautiful creatures that I have seen, but I suppose part of what makes him attractive is that he has not been corrupted to the point of knowing that he is cuter than 99% of the people around him.  Its funny, I don't think I am ugly by any means, but when it comes to being in public, I am one of the most insecure people I know.  In a group of people I instantly feel fat, unstylish (missed that gene), and generally feel no one would want to talk to me... however, put me in the same room with a wig, dress, pumps and some thick makeup, and I will own it in no time at all.  People are often shocked at how introverted I become when I am not busy being my character.  I didn't have the guts to talk to my friend about my own insecurities, I made him promise to work on his self-esteem, and what I should have said is that we will work on our self-esteems together.  I think right now, as I wander around trying to find that someone to be with, my self-esteem should come first, I have enough things to overcome that I shouldn't be adding senseless personal crap to the list. I wish it were that easy to just snap your fingers and poof it all changes.  I will keep you posted on my progress.  On other fronts, I have begun to notice lately that I am getting lonely... not for friends, cuz thank god I have an amazing family of friends that keep me sane and all, but for something more.  I miss being able to share my bed with someone (not like that you gutterminds) and I miss "spooning", but I think the thing I miss the most about a relationship is that 20 minutes or so right before you fall asleep with your boyfriend, where you just talk about anything and everything.  Before I got sick, I never paid any attention to whether someone was poz or negative before I dated them... now that the shoe is on the other foot, I find myself trying to completely avoid talking to boys who are negative.  The problem with that however, is that the majority of men who are as open about their status as I am are MUCH older than I am, or if they are near my age, they are often still very angry about their diagnosis and leading a very reckless lifestyle.  The problem with dating guys that are negative is that in the back of my mind I would always be terrified I would infect them.  Its fucked up because many times I catch myself feeling like I am a walking toxic waste container...and the blood running through my veins is nothing more than poison waiting to either kill me or someone else... killing me, I can deal with, killing someone else, I could never deal with that.  I so often find myself flooding my free time with my involvement with the Court and the Frat and my friends to keep my mind free of the whole dating thing... I think it is just catching up to me a bit.  I don't mean to be whining about my life, because I am definately one of the luckiest men in the world, and I know that many of the people that read this talk about how strong I am and how positive I am about my place in life, I just suppose that today is not one of my strong days...I suppose that is what brothers are for.   Andrew, answer your phone....GRRRR

      WOW, it has been nearly a week since I have posted anything... I am sorry it has taken me so long.  I have been in Kansas, where apparently they don't believe in computers.  Needless to say we have a lot of catching up to do.  First off, on the fraternity front.  Not much has happened as of late, I kind of feel shitty cuz I haven't really been in touch with my boys.  I tried calling all of them on Sunday, but my phone was screwing up, so much so that there was a misunderstanding and they thought I was in Boulder!!  Lawd I wish I had been.  I love spending time with my mom and shit, but Kansas really is a shit hole.  Geoff seems to be doing ok, its funny he keeps looking for love in all the wrong places (sounds like a bad country song).  Its so hard to explain that it will come to him soon enough.  He is such a nice boy and cute on top of that... I would hate to see him just give it up to any boy that casts a glance his way.  He is worth so much more than that.  Jeff...he is a giggling fool... But you gotta love him.   I tried to call on sunday and my phone was so ghetto.  He just giggled the whole time, he couldn't hear a word I was fucking saying and just giggled through a one sided conversation... Anyway he called me back the next day and assured me that all was good in his world.  I just got all caught up on his comic that I missed while I was gone.  He is one twisted boy... awww, like big like lil.  Tony... I don't hear much from Tony at all, I certainly hope that he is in contact with his Surrogate.  It sucks that I can't be there for them all more, but especially for Tony who is really looking for something specific from this pledge process... I certainly hope I have the ability to mold and shape him even without being in constant contact.  When I was pledging DLP, my big bro and I never hung out once.  All of our contact was on the phone... luckily I was close to other brothers that took me under their wing.  And in Sig Ep, the bonds that I made there with my big bro really are still very strong, we still keep in touch.  On the home front:  Last week, I was put in a position I never want to be put in again.  I had to ask Dubya to leave my house.  He started moping around and when he curled up in a ball on the couch and started wailing because Tony and I were going out to do something together, I was finished.  Tony came into the drag room and had to sit down in order to keep from getting so angry that he hit him.  I didn't realize what was going on until I went to investigate.  I had laid out the ground rules about staying here, and that Tony was allowing him to stay here as a favor to me, not to him.  I refuse to allow another person, brother or not, make me or my room mate uncomfortable in our own house.  He got really upset and I had to leave or I would have caved... Lord knows I am a softy and have NO desire to see someone hurt or struggle.  But I strongly believe that by not forcing him to help himself, I was part of the problem.  Tony came back from Lexington on Sunday to find Dubya in my bedroom.  He had snuck in while we were gone and was kind of hiding out.  He begged Tony to let him stay and begged Tony for money...  Tony stood his ground and did not allow either.  I guess Tony saw him Monday night at a meeting for the Royal Court, and all seemed fine.  But on Tuesday there was a message on our phone from his job, he did not show up to work and he was not welcome to return.    God I hope he is doing ok, and that he didn't do something stupid.  He has attempted suicide before, I just pray that he didn't find that to be the only option.  I don't know that I could handle that weight on my shoulders.  Thats all for now... I will write more soon...

      So I knew it wouldn't take long before something got me going...  Today, one of the colonists put a post on his blog that made me so angy I didn't know how to respond...  So I have consulted some of my close friends and people that I turn to for advice and guidance.  First off you can read the post I am talking about at  urlLink   but the part in particular that I am talking about is this:   "So what overall is my view on homosexuality? Basically, it lies in minimization. As genetic engineering evolves, i think it prudent to find the gay genes and try to take them out of society, lessening the numbers and increasing the welfare of these now "breeder" children. I don't think those that are already born, or even those born in the future should be persecuted, but I also find it counterproductive to give rights and privileges to a section of a society which should be minimized. Homosexuals are often wonderful people and I don't deny that in any way. But, from an optimum-seeking point of view, it would be better if they were straight. "   My good friend Tony came up with the following response:   You are constituionally entitled to free speech, however, when your use of your constitutional rights to pursue a riotous position they are violated.  Just as you may not scream "fire" in a theatre you may not suggest that people to be "genetically re-eingineered" to elimnate a potentially undesirable social trait as it is inciteful of riot. Please know that our particular society is in the midst of growth and flux and making decisions so drastic as to remove a segment is foolish, short-sighted and clearly lacking in the knowledge of social change.  Please also know that our society is one of many on this tiny little thing we call our planet.  Many of these societies would be less than pleased to think that at one point in history, given the opportunity, you would have chosen to eliminate them because of a perceived flaw...Have you heard of a little thing called "The Hallocaust"?  I suggest you visit a museum in your area and re-visit your ideals on "elimination" and "minimization".   I could have not said it any better and anything I try to add to this will just be beating a dead horse.  The one thing I do want to say is that I do apploaud Jason for having the balls to speak his views, knowing full well that they are going to cause him flack.

      Whats gone on since my last post...Yesterday was a pretty good day!!!  First off, I got a "line" at work...for those of you not in the know, that means that for the first time in 8 months, the airline can't fuck with my life... I know in advance where I am going and how long I am going to be there for the entire month.  The lil bros seem to be doing fine, Geoff quickly bounced back from the Brandon incident and has now set his sights on a new boy that he thinks (at least aesthetically speaking) is the bees knees.  I don't know that I agree with him, but it put a smile on my little brothers face, thats all that concerns me.  Now we don't know if the mystery boy likes other boys, or if he likes girls, but Geoff assures me he will find out.  I didn't have the heart to tell him he should probably figure that out before he plans his seduction attack.  Jeff is doing good, he seems to be bouncing off the walls since Jessie is back in town.  I gotta tell ya, just like a mother, you gotta love it when your kids are all smiley...  I still haven't heard much from Tony... I know he was concerned about time, so I hope it is all working out for him.  I had some great chats with some of the other colonists, including one with Webb.  I had not gotten a chance to meet Webb before this last weekend, and even then our interaction was minimal...  I can see however through our chat we are going to be good friends...  On the homefront, my roomie and I sat down last night and had a planning meeting about my aspirations to compete at Miss Gay America.  We were figuring out the costs involved, and whether it is actually something I want to spend my money on.  I have no dillusions that I would win the National Title, but it would be great to be able to compete...one of my concerns is that once I go, I could easily become addicted and keep pouring money to go back.  I don't want to be one of these queens that spends all of the money they have to go to Miss America 22 times before they either die or just give up...  Dubya is still here... Tony told me last night that he thinks Dubya is planning on staying in this job he has.  What a stupid notion... the job was supposed to be temporary until he could find something that paid better and could help him get on track.  He is also seeming to become very comfortable staying here... he will have to get past that, cuz he ain't living here.  As my roomie says, I aint taking no one to raise.  Oh well, some people have no drive or ambition.  I am not sure I understand that way of thinking...  At any moment you could be struck dead, and you have done nothing to lead the life that you want.  I may not have a lot, materially speaking of course, but at least when I go, I will go knowing that I have done my best to lead a life that I was happy in.  Well, thats it for now, I may post more later, I am waiting for some reactions to some emails I sent to various people and to the frat mailing list.

      So I had a good nights sleep, I totally feel like a new man.  The whole weekend I was in Boulder I didn't sleep so well... it totally helps that I have the most comfortable bed in the universe (except my room mates).  I had a few great conversations with colonists and a nice one with Geoff... It seems he asked a boy out, but the guy said no.  He didn't seem to be heartbroken over it, which is really a good thing.  When I was his age I didn't do rejection well.  Who am I kidding, I don't do rejection well now, hence the reason I don't talk to boys.  But seriously, it didn't take much rejection for me to become more than a little bitter and jaded... I am glad he is doing better than I would be.  Geoff brought up some great questions in his blog about injustice from a friend, and about passions...I wish I was better at this blog thing so I could post a comment about his post on his blog (maybe I will work on that later) but in the meantime, I have some things to say about his comments.  Geoff was asked what constitutes an injustice from a friend... Now I don't know the boy that he asked out well enough to know what he was getting at when he asked Geoff this question, but for me, the question is very unclear.  We each have levels of tolerance for things our friends do.  For the most part, we know what they are going to do and how they are going to react, many times that is a founding reason that we have become friends in the first place.  I wonder if the injustice that Geoffs love interest was talking about was more that he thought of Geoff as a friend and hadn't really considered anything more...Geoff rather boldly asked if he was interested... apparently not something this boy was expecting.  It would seem that maybe he is worried about losing the friendship now that this subject was breached. I certainly don't see that happening, Geoff is a bit too committed to his friendships to let that happen I think.  Passions - Geoff asked about passions, and suggested that maybe he has mellowed beyond passion.  I can attest that is certainly not the case.  But the question forced me to examine some of my own passions, but also what constitutes a passion.  I realized that the way I define passion, I only have one: relationships.  Before you start thinking i am some kind of relationship whore, I should explain what I mean by that... I mean relationships with friends, with family, and even with total strangers.  My passion is building stronger bonds with these people, my passion is contributing a positive change to peoples lives, my passion is doing my best to be a better person for other people everyday, in turn making me more satisfied with life.  I of course occassionally make mistakes, sometimes I do things that don't follow this plan, sometimes I hurt people that I would never intend to, but I try to learn from the situation and correct the problem as soon as possible.  Just as someone passionate about music might play a wrong note while playing their favorite piano concerto...nothing you can do, you can't undo what you have already played, only learn from it and try to keep it from happening again.  I think that one of the reasons I have decided to go back to school full time to get my degrees in poly sci and law, is to better able myself to effectively change the world around me and protect people that are not able to do so themselves.  I want to better peoples lives who otherwise would never know I was alive.  I want to insure that generations of people after me have basic civil rights and protections that we all are intitled to, thus building better relationships with the world.  One of the colonists messaged me last night and was afraid that he had let me down because of some very minor (in the grand scheme of things) incidents over the weekend.  I put him at ease by reminding him the same thing that I say to anyone... if I am angry, you will know.  As my roomie says, "my name is not Victoria, there are no secrets here"  I suppose if there were I would not have this journal.  Whats funny is that he has no idea exactly how much like me when I was pledging that he is.  All of these guys are so afraid of letting us down, and I think they don't realize we are all afraid we are going to let them down.  On the homefront, my frat brother Dubya (his real name is Chris, but I like the nickname better) has been out of a job for a while, by his own doing I should add.  He was dating my room mate for a short period (8 weeks if you ask him, 6 weeks if you ask my room mate).  They broke up a few weeks ago and Dubya has been acting stupid the whole time (like crying non stop and making himself throw up, kind of stupid)... Now I love my room mate, he is one of my favorite people in the world and truly one of my dearest friends, but NO ONE is worth all that.  Anyway, Dubya has no money, like not just broke, but literally NO money... so I asked Tony if he would mind if I offered Dubya to stay in my room while I was gone on vacation, to save him the gas of driving all the way out to BFE where he lives.  Tony said he would only do it for me, and that if he acts stupid he is not going to be very nice to him... I offered Dubya the room, and laid out the ground rules.  Basically, if you think you are going to mope around or worse yet, cry, then go to my room and shut the door.  Dont make Tony uncomfortable in his own home.  So whats he do?  He starts crying when he asks Tony if they can talk about their relationship (something he was strictly forbidden to do)  Now Tony definately seem uncaring, in fact, he came to the realization that he lacks empathy...  Tony let Dubya have it, I think some things were said that were not very nice, but apparently it worked... it seems that Dubya has to be screamed at to get through to him.  I don't mind helping people out, especially a brother, there is nothing I wouldn't do to help... but you have to be helping yourself.  Dubya is being evicted from his apartment (he has till the 31st of Jan. to get out)  but he is not doing anything to find another place or to get his stuff together.  I am finding that I don't really care... I have no sympathy for him, because he is not doing anything to resolve the situation.  I dunno, I don't want to see him go homeless, but god damn, why help someone who doesn't have the self-respect to help themselves... brother or not.  I suppose I have written WAY too much... no one likes to read these long entries, but I sure do feel better when they are done... Thanks for listening

      So today is it... the first blog as a boy...  I suppose I should probably qualify that statement.... I have another blog, but it is on my drag page (www.monicamoree.com).  I don't know exactly where to begin this so I suppose I will just write and see what happens.  Today I just got home from Boulder, and visiting all the colonists.  I stayed with my little brother Geoff.  I am sure that he is glad to have his apartment back to himself.  I totally talked his ear off all weekend.  I suppose I was over compinsating, cuz I had read his blog right before I left Cincinnati to visit him, and in it, he mentioned he was considering leaving DLP.  I hope that he reconsidered that thought.  Not just cuz I don't want to lose a little brother (although that always sucks) but because it is young men like Geoff that I think have the most to gain from a Brotherhood like DLP.  He really started to come out of his shell while I was there, I just hope it wasn't too jarring for him.  I also got to hang with my other little bro Tony, he and I had yet to meet or communicate at all... what a great guy, a little nervous about the whole thing I think, but I suppose as a pledge we all are a bit nervous cuz you just don't know what to expect for the future... he really has the desire and the drive to go someplace within the frat, and it is really refreshing to witness that.  I hope he is able to work through his time constraints, he is lucky though, he has a great "family" that is watching his back... I can't wait for his next performance in opera, rumor has it, he is really good.  I will totally be there to watch (I will be the proud Dad in the back of the audience giving the standing ovation with tears in my eyes).  I know that sounds pathetic, but there is nothing more rewarding than having a little brother and watching him succeed in the frat and in life.  I didn't get to spend much alone time with my other little brother.  His name is Jeff.  He is a freak, and I love that about him.  In hindsite, I feel bad for not spending more time with him this weekend, I think I just figured he was doing fine as far as the frat goes.  I was initially disappointed in him and Tony, cuz I they hadn't studied at all for their test on Sunday.  Then on Sunday afternoon right before the test, I asked him if he was ready for it, and asked him to do the greek alphabet (fully expecting him to not know it).  I couldn't believe what happened next, he DID IT!!!  I was so happy.  At the pledge class, he had to do it while I held a burning match and get through the alphabet 3 times before I burned my finger... what he didn't realize, was that he was supposed to fail in order to teach the entire group a lesson... when he was starting, he was wanting to look at his pledge brothers, but I made him look me in the eye (I was acting all tough, but deep down I wanted him to know I knew he could do it).  He started and it was obvious to me that he was going to make it through the test, so I had to mess him up, so that the class could learn the lesson they needed to.  I hope he knows how proud I was of him for being brave enough to get up there and do it but even more to get up there and do it so well.  Throughout the weekend, I got to hang out with a bunch of the other boys...They really are going to be wonderful brothers, I don't think there is a single one of them that I would not want as a brother (hell, truth be told, I probably already think of them as brothers)  Thursday night when I arrived, we met at a night club called Dream, where they open up toage 16 and up.  I was so scared going there.  I don't do nightclubs well, I get so self concious about my looks, and I am HIV+, and I get so scared of being in the situation where I meet someone cool and then have to tell them "oh, by the way..."  But the big brothers, and the pledges were all there and I had to put on a happy face and try to make the best of it.  All in all I had a WONDERFUL night.  A couple of the boys showed up to the event drunk, and I was disappointed in them for that.  Not cuz they had a cocktail or anything, cuz I don't think I can get mad at them for something I used to do... but more because I thought it was disrespectful to the big brothers.  The scariest thing for me was that I found out several of the boys are on diet pills... I think they think I was being a hard ass or I wanted to fuck with their fun, but the truth was I was scared that something would happen to one of them.  Also, not one of these guys needs to be worrying about their weight... being a boy with a history of eating disorders, I worried about them.  Needless to say, I was glad to realize there was no ephedra in what they were taking, just lots of caffine.  I just hope they know what they are doing.  And they should all know they are all hot boys just the way they are.  On some other notes, Andrew told me yesterday that a Brother on the BOD has a problem with me and thinks I am a bad person because of my past...  He told Andrew that I have a warrant for my arrest for prostitution in Las Vegas.  Andrew already knew about it, because he was one of the few people that I have ever mentioned it to, and to every person I mentioned it to, it was done under the Veil Of Secrecy (a thing in my frat. that is stronger than a pinky swear that you will not tell a soul).  I felt so betrayed when Andrew told me about this, because I had not ever mentioned it to this brother, but rather he was told by someone else whom I had confided in "under the veil"  It just so happened that at the time Andrew told me about this, I was trying to teach my little brothers how important it is to trust your brothers, it was so hard to tell them about how a brother will not betray your trust etc. when it had just happened to me.  Andrew reminded me that the men in this colony are of a MUCH higher calibre than the men that had tried to bring me down.  I decided that I could retaliate against the brothers in question (people who live in glass houses should really consider checking into plexiglass) and then I realized that would make me no better than them, I have decided to keep my thoughts about their personal lives to myself, and simply maintain the push to make them effective in their leadership positions, in order to better our fraternity, and if they don't like it, they can kiss my ass.  I supposed I have rambled on enough for this first post, I am sure they will be shorter in the future, I just had a lot on my mind after a very eventful weekend.

      So I did drag last night... I kind of felt bad for Tony cuz I was a little grumpy and complainy... My car got towed last week, so we had to walk to the bar. I suppose it is about a half mile walk or more, so by the time we got there, I was ready to have the heels off.  I am also not a queen that likes to go out in drag for no reason... I don't like to just be seen, I need to be on the stage to make it worth all the discomfort.  This bar that we were in was VERY VERY smokey so my eyes were burning, I was hungry, my corset was hurting, and I was not very happy with how I looked... mostly because I couldn't wear pads cuz the ones we made were too big and we didn't have time to shave them down... so I went padless.  Tony said it looked fine, but I felt naked.  I bitch at queens all the time for not wearing pads so I felt unprofessional, and since this was most of these queens first time seeing me, I certainly didn't want to give that impression.  Most of the crowd at this bar is very young, so I have to look good to them, not just to me, last night I felt very "courtly" meaning I looked very pretty, and very regal, and very old.  I should have been wearing something short and slutty for these kids with some down or really crazy hair...  Oh well, something to work on for next time.  Yesterday I signed up to walk with the Beta Delta boys in Miami for the Miami AIDS Walk.  I am very excited about that, it sounds like lots of fun, and I know that we had a great time walking for the Las Vegas AIDS walk... even though it was 200 degrees outside.  It will be my first visit to Miami when I am not working, to see the city away from the beach, I am really excited about all that.  I have been talking to Dominick lately, I miss him so much.  Apparently things aren't going so well for him in Utah.  He seems to be waiting for me to say "I told you so," but I have no intentions on that, I think he made the decision to move there for the right reason, I just feel bad for him that his family pressured him into it, and now it is not working out for him.  I told him he is welcome to come here to Cincinnati and then along to Miami if he wants to.  I think he is planning on visiting here for his 21st birthday, which is great, I can't believe how much I have missed him.  Usually when I leave a place I miss my friends a bit, but as most things do, they fade.  Dominick is a little different... I really think of him as my family, and I think the only reason I agreed to take this job in Cincinnati was because he agreed to come with me.  It was probably for the best that he waited till I already started flying to tell me he needed to go to Utah instead.  So now I find myself reminiscing about all the stupid stuff he and I would do, like eating Jack In The Box at 4 in the morning after a show, or the really meaningful things that he did like helping me get back on a horse after not riding forever, or waiting up for me at home after my unfortunate incarceration.  Or him sleeping on my floor every weekend or hauling my ass all over town when my jeep wouldn't run (which was most of the time).  The good news is that I can talk to him a lot on the phone, and maybe he will decide to come along to Miami (although I doubt he will)... I am sure he and Tony would get along very well.  Although Tony would have to get used to having someone else share in the chore of getting Ms. Moree ready.  I suppose I have lamented enough for now, I will write more later... maybe on my trip this weekend if I get to a computer.

      I don't have a lot to say right now, I just want to address one issue that is on my mind.  It has come to my attention that a few of the pledges have a problem with my previous blog.  I would like to just point out that this is my personal diary, an outlet for me to work through whatever is on my mind, I have chosen to allow others to read it, because very little in my life is a secret.  If I start editing my thoughts and feelings because of who I think might read them, then the diary loses its point.  To those of you who don't like reading blogs, I simply say don't read them.  If you take issue with something I say, please remember you are entering my world...  I refuse to edit my thoughts and feelings, simply to spare you.

      GOOD MORNING!!!  Its been a few days since I have posted, but not a lot has been going on.  I tried to go to LA the other day for the frat, but the flights wound up being full. Oh well, I really couldn't afford the trip anyway.  While I was in DC over Valentines Day, I totally overspent my allowance for the last half of the month... I totally forgot about my car payment.  DOH!  On the way home from DC, I had a planeful of 13 year olds.  This trip was proof positive why more people should eat their young.  I truly have a new respect for teachers in todays world.  I have recently been chatting away on gay.com... thats something I don't usually do, because my saturation level for people is usually near it limits.  But I decided it would not hurt to be a bit more social.  My screen name on there is yngPOZcentaur, and my bio clearly states that I am not looking for a hookup.  It never fails someplace in the first 5 minutes of a chat with someone, they want to know if I am a bottom or top.  Now I generally dont mind answering these questions, if I am looking to play, but I usually humor them.  One man went as far as to ask, I answered, and he said great, are you clean?  now my original response was "yes, I just got out of the shower, and am all douched up... I am never a dirty fuck"  he aparently didn't get my humor, and said "I mean are you disease free?"  To which I replied what part of yngPOZcentaur are you not getting, not to mention it is all over my profile.  He apologized and said he could fuck with poz guys, again I replied "your in luck, cuz I can't fuck stupid people".  The next one that really got me was the guy that said "he, I just wanted to say I'm sorry"  well, being a true glutton for punishment, I had to ask why he was sorry "I am sorry that you are HIV+ and just wanted to try to make you feel better".  I am really glad he mentioned all of that, cuz I hadn't realized I had been feeling bad, and certainly him telling me everything was going to be ok, made me feel much better.  In fact I had been waiting for a complete stranger to tell me that, so I could get on with living.  I wonder where most of these people get their manners.  At which point does it become ok to open a conversation with a total stranger with comments like that.  Quickly realizing my job in life is not to educate the chatting public on manners I just ignore these fools, and hope that someday they will realize how stupid they sound.  On other fronts, the boys are nearing their final, and I had some concerns about whether they are ready for brotherhood.  I constantly have to remind myself that we (the mentors) are not a chapter bringing in a pledge class, because if so everything we would be doing is qualitative, not quantitative.  These guys threw a fundraiser together at the last minute with the intention of just getting it done.  Which just hurt themselves... most of these guys can't afford some of the fee's that they are required to have before they can become brothers.  The other point that really got me was that there are 7 of these 17 whom, I have never even spoken to.  That is a major problem to me, in that I don't think they have fulfilled their commitments to become brothers... by ignoring me, a brother, they are not sending a clear message to me that they have got "it".  This situation caused me to get very upset, and caused Andrew and I to argue, which is something that we never do.  Andrew basically said that I was out of sight out of mind, and that I am not available like the other mentors... a very true statement, I am not physically around them much, but I email the group often, give them alternatives to phoning me and make myself available at all times for them.  My concern is if I am out of site out of mind, how are they going to treat alumni down the road... how are they going to be treated when they graduate and move on... are they going to forget they have brothers.  Clay, who is their president, just got accepted to his study abroad semester, are they going to not be in contact with him because he is out of sight out of mind.  Then the straw that broke the camels back... a few of the pledges requested that the mentors not attend the rush event on Friday night at Dream.  I have known Andrew for a while now, and i have seen him upset, and I have even seen him a little angry...but he reached new levels with this request.  Now the boys seem to be coming back with some stories that sound like bullshit to me "what we meant was we want you guys at our events... someone misunderstood and communicated the wrong message to you" or "we just don't want you guys doing it for us" which is trying to pin the blame on the mentors...  the fact is, the event is being held at a nightclub, some of them planned on drinking and didn't want the mentors there because they knew all hell would break loose for underage drinking...and they were right, it would have.  I know I have a ton of them clammoring to get their interviews done with me, because of points they will miss out on.  Now, instead of using the interview to get to know me, they are doing it because it is an assignment.  I am granting the interviews, as long as I have time, but generally feel like now they are on my time.  As Andrew said, its too bad that some of them have overlooked me as a resource.  I think it is too bad some didn't take the time to get to know me as a friend.  I think I am kind of cool    Well, enough drivel for now, I will write more as I think of it...

      So, I have decided, one of the worst things about my job is not having a large crew to go out with when I am on overnights... for example:  In an effort to keep myself sane, I decided that I would treat myself out to a very nice dinner for Valentines Day, while I was in Washington DC.  I had always read articles and even full on books about how the world treats people dining alone, but God Damn!!!  I truly felt like Rosa Parks... The put me in a dining room by myself, away from the rest of the dining public, who on this night happened to be madly in love couples swooning over one another, so truly it probably was not that big of a deal that I wasn't in the mix of it, but getting service was really hard, cuz they would forget I was there... then, on Sunday morning, I went to brunch by myself (I jerked off all night, I figured I at least should buy myself some breakfast)  again, the same treatment (Mrs. Parks, can we show you to your table in the back of the restaurant).  On a good note, I forced myself to go out in DC for a few drinks... met this really nice boy named Collin who I spent a few hours chatting with.  Turns out he is a "dancer" at one of the strip clubs in DC and asked if I would come watch him...uhhhh OK...  it was a nice time, a little wierd, but I have been through wierder... I mean come on I met a lover while we both worked at a brothel.  Is meeting a stripper REALLY such a shock?  Anyway, he seemed VERY surprised that I didn't want to rush back to my hotel to fuck.  I told him I would call him on my next trip into DC and we would have dinner.  Funny no one had ever done that to him before (I rather enjoyed it)...  Anyway,I will write more when I get back to Cincinnati... right now, I am getting ready for bed in Boston...FUCK ITS COLD HERE!!!  PS - a nice quote I heard from the movie "Cold Mountain" that reflect my current Valentine views -   "you ever want to crawl 3 foot up a bulls ass, just listen to the things lovers say to each other"

      WOW!!!  It has been a long time since I posted anything...  I must appologize for that.  I have been in a bit of a funk lately for some reason, and not really doing much of anything social... well, I have been doing some social things, but they will be discussed in a little bit.  I suppose I should start with my thoughts and feelings on Valentines Day since it is once again upon us.  This holiday used to be one of my three favorite holidays (along with Christmas and my Birthday)  My mother always made a point of celebrating EVERY holiday with me, I would get candy and balloons and shit on St. Patricks Day, Easter was big, luckily she stopped short of the Hallmark holidays, and stuck to the classics.  Through that, Valentines Day became one of my favorite, cuz I got to give everyone I knew little cards and candy... I LOVE giving presents.  As I got older, I still got showered with gifts from my mother on Valentines Day, but once I started dating I got to go all out on my boyfriends.  I am telling you, it was the highlight of my year to watch people light up when they would get my sometimes elaborate gifts.  I would usually get some flowers or candy or something in return, but that didn't really matter to me, my gift really was watching them recieve their gifts... I always made it a point to never be single on Valentines Day (oh, to be young and cute again, when they were pounding down your door) then I met Guillaume, who was not a big Valentines Day person, but he quickly learned that it was important to me and he always tried to do something romantic.  After I went to Vegas, I was hit with the harsh reality that the boys were not beating down my door anymore, and that Valentines Day would be spent alone.  So, I did what any self-respecting drama queen would do, I sent myself flowers and took myself to the spa for a nice massage, body wrap and facial.  Feeling worse than I did before I started and with $300 less in my pocket I decided that would be the last year for that indulgence.  The next year, the guy I was dating broke up with me right before Christmas, so no Valentines again... and then came Shaun.  For whatever reason I was in love with this man...even as I uncovered all of his infidelities.  Then, 2 days before Valentines day, he breaks up with me... I was crushed.  I had all this stuff planned.  We were still talking and I told him I would like to go out on Valentines Day with him...he agreed and said we would go to dinner.  Imagine my surprise when we pulled through the McDonalds drive thru.  And then imagine my horror when he told me that his surprise for me was he was taking me to the bath house!!!  What is the most sad to me is that I actually went.  It completely tore apart what Valentines Day was to me... but I couldn't blame him, I agreed to it, and in the moment I was certainly enjoying myself.  We used to call those "low self-esteem fucks" (more on those later).  This year, I truly feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge...kind of Bah Humbug about the whole thing.  I think what bothers me about that is that I have always done a pretty good job about not getting jaded and bitter about things like this.  I was not successful.  This year, I will be in Evansville, Indiana for work... I actually bid to work over the holiday, in an effort to forget it was happening.  Last weekend, I filled my weekend with some of those "low self-esteem fucks" that I mentioned earlier.  These are the people that you have sex with, not because you are horny or even because you like them, but for the sole purpose of making yourself feel wanted, attactive, and in some ways loved.  While I was with Shaun, I had a ton of them usually facilitated through him (meaning he would arrange them) or we would go to the bath house together.  When I finally ended that relationship, I did a pretty good job of stopping the LSEF's.  I mean I would still trick every now and again but for the most part, it was easier and felt better to just pull some taffy (thanks Andrew) and go to sleep.  But last weekend, I made up for lost time.  I truly lived up to the flying mattress standard, I put an ad up in every city I was flying to, and entertained the troops every night.  And when it was all said and done, I felt worse than when I started.  Hopefully this weekend will be better and will just go by without a hitch...  In other news, My room mate just got all his wisdom teeth pulled AND had a root canal... lucky him.  They have him knocked out on pain pills right now.  In the frat, things are going ok... my schedule is once again proving very difficult, I seem to be missing everything important (I sound like a working mom)  The guys have decided to have their neophyte ceremony the last weekend of Feb. and there is not anyway for me to get out of work... I tried that for their retreat and it blew up in my face. Tuesday, I am flying to LA to meet with the Alpha Omicron chapter to help them try to save what they have and salvage a chapter.  My goal is fly into Denver on Wed and stay with the boys until I have to be back to work on Friday... but we will see.  At this point I am afraid to make promises that I am not sure I will be able to keep.  They did plan their Night Of Madness in enough time for me to request the time off from work, so that is good, and the following week, my lil brother Tony has his opera performance.  That is the same time as the start of the Western Regional Conference that I have to help host in Long Beach, but I told Will that I will not be there till Saturday morning, because I made a commitment to Tony that I would be there like a proud parent cheering him on in his first performance of this opera friday night.  It doesn't seem like I ever really talk to them, but that isn't their fault really.  I hope I haven't cheated them out of a good big brother.  I never really hear from any of the other guys...no emails, a few IMs from the ones that I made friends with right away.  But there is a HUGE section of the group I don't know at all...that concerns me.  My excercise and diet plan is going pretty good, I have lost about 2 inches from my waist (the goal is 4 inches off by Memorial Day)  I have also added about an inch to my chest and to each arm (the goal is 5 inches to the chest by memorial day).  So all in all, I am pleased with my results so far... Look out Miami... a new muscle boy is headed your way (OH GOD... just what the world needs)

      So I did it, on Feb. 1st, I started my new diet/excercise/self-image program.  I hate doing shit like this, cuz the possibility of personal failure are pretty high.  This time I am keeping a daily log book of what I eat, when and how much I excersise, goals etc... I will keep you updated on my progress.  The Boulder Bois seem to be doing well.  I am having the most trouble with things I think... this long distance thing is not going so well for me I don't think.  I don't get to see them as much as I would like, and hence don't feel very involved in their lives.  They have their retreat this weekend, and as of right now, it doesn't look like I will be able to attend.  I can't seem to get out of work.  The colony didn't have their schedule for Feb. until after I bid, so it looks like I will probably miss out on their retreat, and possibly their Night Of Madness, and then probably their neophyte ceremony.  Basically all the important shit.  unfortunately my schedule this month doesn't have any weekends off cuz I didn't ask for any cuz I had no guidance.  I sent out an email about bidding for March, and again, they have done no planning that far in advance, so again I will have to kind of bid for whatever and hope for the best.  Seems that I learn most of what is going on in the guys lives by reading their blogs...  Wow, am I in a pissy mood, I should probably stop writing now, before I contaminate my entire day with this negativity... I am off to the coffeehouse for some decaff apricot tea.

      Greetings all!!!  I am in Las Vegas visiting some friends and Brothers... Got some word from the doctor, and they are suggesting that I start meds pretty soon.  I have decided that I won't start meds while I am still in Cincinnati.  I am really worried that starting them while I am in a place that I hate so much will make the experience even worse.  When asked about what it will be like, he didn't have much good to say.  Basically said that the first month is usually hell.  Lots of nausea and stuff, I suppose the good news is that I will lose quite a bit of weight.  =)  One thing I am worried about is that my life is not stable enough to be able to stick to the strict schedule of meds... I never know where I will be each day at a certain time, and apparently the timing of dosage is a fairly big deal.  There is also the possibility of injectable meds, and I don't know if I could stick myself, especially if I am flying.  Although the sooner I learn to be ok with it, the sooner I can be comfortable enough to inject those steroids I have been meaning to buy so I can become buff.  ;-)  I am a little worried that Tony is not wanting to move now, he is having health issues of his own, but he also just got a pretty great promotion at his job.  He seems to love it, but I also worry (as his sister does) that he is pouring himself into his job to run from his fears about his health.  Dominick has said that he would be interested in coming to Miami with me, I would love to have him around again... I can think of very few people that make me feel as good as Dominick does when I am feeling blue.  He and Tony always seem to know what to say or do to bring a smile to my face.  I suppose I should close this for now... I will write more later.

      OHHH, long time no post...  First, I am physically feeling much better... thanks to everyone who was worried about me.  For some reason, I am in a huge funk... I don't know what is going on... this is one of the worst depressions I have had in a long time, and I don't know where it is coming from.  I suppose I should chat to my doctor and look into some meds to see if that helps it go away. I was in San Francisco the other day.  Talk about the mother ship...there were more gays than I knew what to do with.  I decided to attend a meeting of some under 30 poz men. It was great seeing people my own age, dealing with the same thing I am... I think the depressing part is that they are 2000 miles away.  I think one may have been hitting on me... or I was wishing he was hitting on me, he was definately hot.  Anyway, I am hoping to go back out there in the beginning of April... I need to feel that again I think.

      Whew what a week.  I was in Boulder last week for the boys night of madness... WHAT A GREAT TIME!!!  The guys worked really hard to make it all a surprise (and it pretty much worked in spite of my efforts to snoop).  They kidnapped Andrew and sent us on a scavenger hunt to find him.  These things are one of my favorite parts of the fraternity... I truly feel like a kid again running all over town looking for stupid clues (one clue was tucked neatly next to my favorite porn stars dildo at some sleazy adult bookstore!!! I LOVE IT)  I have not been feeling well lately, it started the thursday before NOM in Boulder, and I have not been able to keep much food down... oh well, I suppose it is a good diet plan.  Then again, I should go to the doctor to figure out what is up.  I thought it had gotten better cuz I felt a little better for the last couple days, keeping food down anyway.  Then last night I went out to eat with Tony cuz we haven't seen each other in a minute... I was doing good and I was trying to keep it all down, but got home and the food decided it didn't like my tummy anymore.  I am off to Palm Springs today to shoot a video tomorrow, that should be fun, I hope to just relax and have a good time while I am there.  If I am not totally better by the time I get back I will have the doctor check me out...  Have I mentioned, I HATE THE DOCTOR?  Two of my lil brothers are now big brothers to pledges.  I am so excited for them.  Being a big is one of the coolest and most rewarding things you can do.  My other lil Tony is performing in his opera this weekend, I hope he does well.  I was originally going to go see him but decided I should not put him at risk with his family... cuz I am sure I would want to run up and give him a hug after the show...  I am not so good at pretending I don't know someone.    Anyway, I have to run, I will write more when I get back from Palm Springs (gay old mens Mecca)

      Well, I had a great trip over the weekend, one of the things that I love about this company is that because it is a small crew on each plane (me and 2 pilots) if you have a group of good pilots, and you have them for the entire trip, by the end of it, you can become pretty good friends.  My company has a lot of younger guys flying which is cool cuz they tend to be more open to hanging out with a big Mary Sissy like myself.  So on Saturday, we spent the day on the river in Savannah playing pool and drinking a local beer.  I had way too much fun, and woke up the next morning with a cold  =( so I slept while they went to dinner in Manchester, NH.  In Greensboro, the Capt. took us out to dinner which was cool, we had a great time.  I look forward to flying with them again.  I was supposed to fly to Denver yesterday, but missed my flight... the lady at security could have let me through the shorter line when I showed her how soon my flight was leaving, but she decided to play God and punish me (who does she think she is?  Mel Gibson?)  I can't wait to see the guys, it has been a while.  I enjoy hanging with Andrew and getting to know Dave more as well as Michael.  Hopefully I will be able to see my little brothers... they are all horribly busy this weekend.  If not, I know I will have a great time with the other Mentors...

      What a crazy day yesterday!!!  It was one of those really long days of flying (14 hours and 6 cities), but I was really well rested and was in a great mood... I was even being nice to people!!!  Then it happened...  I was in Atlanta, and feeling a bit hungry, so I popped into the Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken for a bite to eat... After pondering the menu, I decided to go with the chicken.  I collected my deep fried delicacy, paid my bill, doused my red beans and rice with Louisiana Hot Sauce (ignoring the fact that I was in Georgia, not Louisiana as the label would have you believe) collected my sweet tea (when in Rome...) and headed out the door back to my plane.  BAM!!!  This man ran into me... Totally because he was to busy cussing out the woman he was with (presumably his wife).  The conversation was pretty one sided and went something like this:  Man (to woman): "You need to bitch to someone who gives a fuck, your fat ass can pee on the plane, you took to long last time" Woman (kind of to the man, but more addressed to the carpet below her):  "you're right, I am sorry"  I couldn't believe what I was hearing... I didn't know if I was watching a Lifetime Television Movie or what (I want Denzel Washington to play my part) I even turned around and caught myself as I was about to berate this ignorant chauvinistic prick when I realized I was in my uniform and didn't need to get fired much less arrested that day... I dare a man to ever think he is going to talk to me like that.  He had better be wearing his running shoes, cuz when I catch him... I mean really, I was raised to never talk to a woman like that ESPECIALLY in front of a house of worship (ie: Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken)...  I made the mistake of calling my Mom a bitch one time... (key words = ONE TIME) I woke up a week and a half later after apparently having some emergency dental work done with a hand print across my cheek.  Imagine if I had called her fat or worse said anything in that tone to her in public...  They would have been laying white lilies on my grave (Tony can just put rocks on my headstone to let the world know he visited... Do me a favor put a bunch up there so I look popular).  Well that experience changed my whole mood... I was crabby from then on.  I nearly didn't enjoy my fried chicken (luckily, reason took hold and brought me back to reality... It wasn't the chickens fault)  The next flight was delayed cuz of a mechanical issue... No big deal but it was very hot on the plane... I asked the crew to turn up the AC, and they promised me that it was on as high as it could go... We finally take off, and I am doing my beverage service in my suit, sweating like Whitney Houston going through customs, and this man rings his call button and the conversation went something like this:  Him: "Its fucking hot in here, tell them to turn on the air" Me:  "I may have noticed (wiping sweat from my forehead) they have told me the air is on as high as it can go, so we are doing all we can. Him: "bull shit, its fucking forty-fucking-degrees below fucking zero outside and this is the best you can do?" Me (having just snapped from the poor use of the f-word): "what the fuck do you want me to do roll down a fucking window"?  I felt bad for losing my temper and couldn't believe I had cursed to a passenger (I mean that is something I only do in my fantasies).  I was comforted by the old woman behind him who reassured me that she would have said the exact same thing.  I apologized to the man for losing my temper, and again explained that I was hot as well, and if there were anything I could do to correct the situation, it would have already been done.  He understood, apologized as well, and it appears as though I might escape being fired this time.  Came home and Chris picked me up from the airport and we hung out at my place for a while... His neck was really hurting him pretty bad, but I didn't know what to do about it, I offered to rub it, but he seemed a little leary of all that...But eventually succumbed to my pressure and he said it felt a lot better (I think he was lying, but it was nice to hear none the less).  I am still not sure what is going on with our situation, but I know I like him, and he seems interested in me enough... I suppose sometime really soon we should sit down and have the talk (ok, are we dating? And if so, what does that mean for you and what does that mean for me) not something I am looking forward to having, cuz I know my views on relationships are very different from anyone else's... Or at least his, but we will see...  that's all for now, I will write more as it happens...

      WOW, it has been a while since I have posted anything... Lets see...Where to begin...  Oh yeah, good news the Doc said my counts are on the rebound to where they should be, so I don't have to start meds right away... I may have said I told you so to him, but he didn't seem amused.  Needless to say, that means no runaway move to Miami... I will hold out in Cincinnati for a bit longer.  One thing I am waiting on is how Tony's health is doing.  I do hope that he is well enough to move as we had planned, I really don't want to move without him.  On the Dominick front, it is looking more and more like he is going to be leaving Utah... Sounds like he is going to go home for a short while (to Las Vegas) and then he is talking a bit more seriously about moving to Miami, or where ever I happen to be.  He and I have been talking a lot more recently, which is a great thing cuz I miss him greatly.  I met a boy on Saturday night... His name is Chris.  He is a very cute boy who I think needs to get his contacts adjusted cuz he keeps telling me how cute I am.  Anyway, we met on Saturday night while I was out with Tony.  Now Tony knows everyone in Cincinnati, and has been accused of running for mayor more than once.  Anyway, Chris and Tony knew each other, but I thought that maybe there was a bit more of an interest between them.  So needless to say I kept dropping hints to Tony that I thought his friend was cute, and Tony never really pushed me to go talk to him (like he normally would) so I assumed that Chris was hands off.  No man is worth fighting with a friend over (not that I think Tony and I would ever fight over a man... But still it is never good form).  Anyway, I was out on the dance floor trying to learn some stupid line dance that really should not have been as difficult as it was (could have been the beer that Chris kept buying me) and every time I would look over there, he was looking at me and smiling.  Well you know that I am a sucker for a nice smile and pretty eyes and he was working both for Jesus.  The end of the night was approaching quickly, so I asked him if he would like to dance, (first time I have done that in a couple years) and so we are slow dancing and some how we ended up kissing.  Now when it comes to kissing, I am just like Greg Brady, I see the fireworks and everything...Especially on the first kiss.  This time was no different.  Anyway, we get outside and we somehow determine that I will be going over to his house (I know what you are thinking... What a slut I am... But wait)  So I tell Tony I will call him in the morning, and we part, as we get into Chris' car and start driving I realize I had yet to tell him my status and that I should probably do so before we get too far from downtown, just in case he freaks and I have to walk home...  So I tell him and he is totally cool!!!  First time I have experienced that in Cincinnati...  It turns out that he had been trying to talk to me for about a year online and for some reason I would never talk to him.  Now I didn't recognize his screen name at first but once I looked it up and saw his picture, I remembered him all too well.  I didn't talk to him cuz I thought he was too cute to be chatting with me, I figured he must have been playing a game or something... How stupid was I???  Anyway, went back to his house, and we watched a movie (well we watched part of a movie before falling asleep), and then for the first time in almost 2 years, I shared a bed with a boy and cuddled all night long... No nookie for me that night, but the cuddling was totally worth it.  We have chatted on the phone quite a bit, hopefully we can see each other again, and see what happens.  Anyway, that's it for now, I will write more as more happens...

      TO MARTY  To the first man (in a year of living here) in Cincinnati who was brave enough to come ask me to two step... THANK YOU!!!  I hate that the culture in this city has made it ok to create line-dances to songs you would never line dance to (hello!!! they line danced to Usher...) in order that you would never have to talk to someone you don't know.  Country dancing was developed to be a mixer, for strangers to get to know each other and lovers to get closer... not push each other away.  The beautiful thing about 2 stepping and other country couple dancing is that you don't have to be attracted to the person you are dancing with... sometimes its just nice to walk out there and go "short short LOOONG short short LOOONG" no matter who it is with.

      Look everyone, a post and it hasn't even been a month since my last one.  This weekend I went out to Buffalo, NY for their coronation, for the most part, I had a wonderful time... there was some drama, but nothing insurmoutable... somehow in a drunken stupor on Friday night, I sprained my knee and ended up visiting the emergency room to make sure it wasn't going to fall off.  It is still very painful and today my lower leg is all swollen.  If it doesn't get better, I suppose I should go to a doctor here.  The main reason for this post is to share a story with you from Saturday night.  I was having a bad evening cuz of the pain in my leg, and some of the unfurling drama surrounding the event, and I was down in the hotel lobby at the ATM.  I had my face completely made up and this little black girl asked her mother why I was wearing make up.  Her mother explained that I did drag, and that I was the woman that she had just seen about 30 minutes ago.  The little girl leaned into her mom and said just above a whisper "Mom, some people call those people gay" her mother leaned back and said "some people call you a nigger, is that very nice?"  This little girls eyes got really big and sad and she walked over to the ATM machine and tugged on my shirt and said "I am sorry if I hurt your feelings, I didn't mean to..." Amazing how one instant can change your intire outlook on things.  For a split second I saw the world through the eyes of an innocent child, and I watch a wonderful mother take the opportunity to squash hate before it ever had a chance to get started.  My hat is off to her, she is doing what so many fail at.  I should also mention that these people were in the hotel for a Baptist convention.  I have said a thousand times, it is the mark of a true Christian to not sit in judgement of anyone...unfortunately I don't think there are many of them around.  I would love to peek in on that little girls life 20 years from now and see what becomes of her.

      So, it has been nearly a month since I posted last... I am not sure why I have been so bad about writing on a regular basis.  I suppose I just find myself doing other things and just procrastinating on this...anyway, I am sorry, here is the latest dose of my world...  A couple weeks ago, after having still not had any sexual relations with Chris (the boy that I had been seeing for about 3 weeks), I decided I would ask the question (basically the question that says "what the fuck").  He had become really distant, and I knew something was up, but he was not looking to talk about it. So it was clear the only way to figure out the trouble was to push the issue. So I finally cornered him on the phone while I was on an overnight to ask if there was a problem...he played stupid, like there was nothing wrong with the direction our relationship was going (for the record, I FUCKING HATE THAT SHIT!!! DON'T PLAY STUPID WITH ME!!!)  I explained to him how I had come to the conclusion that something was wrong... he then cracked and said I was absolutely right there was some stuff on his mind that was bothering him about us... again I pressed the issue to get him to tell me.  everyone hold tight, here comes the surprise of the century!!! He was concerned about the HIV issue.  No real shock there for me, but I told him to take some time and figure out what he wanted to do.  Two weeks pass and still no communication from him, so I decide to give him a call, because I believe I at least deserve to hear (or even read) the words and maybe even an explanation.  He said (again after much pushing) that we should have dinner together to talk, and he would give me a call.  Again I waited about 3 days and saw him online and decided to move in for the kill.  Anyway, after much beating around the bush I got him to finally say that he just couldn't get around the HIV issue (again, not a huge surprise here, but I did feel I deserved to read it at least)  Sunday, I was out with Tony and saw this guy that I have had a crush on for a while... I just assumed he was never interested.  Needless to say we hung out at the bar that evening and things were pretty cool...again nothing to write home about but any glimmer of hope is better than none.  I gave him my number, but he has yet to use it... I don't really expect him to actually. I think it may have just been the alcohol working overtime.

      Hello all -   Its been a long time since I posted anything, but you will see through this post, that it has been a very very crazy time for me. So here it goes:  about 3 weeks ago, I woke up looking at a pile of hair on my pillow, since I knew I didn't have a cat (especially not one that used the same shampoo as me), I ran my hand through my hair and came back with a handful of hair!!  I ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror as I was effortlessly removing handfuls of hair from my head.  I called the doctor and he was not nearly as concerned as I was, but ordered some more blood work on me.  I went to work and flew a four day trip, by the last day, I pretty much looked like a dog that had mange...little bald patches all over my head (my mom was sure it was only I who noticed it...she made this observation via the telephone not actually seeing my tragedy, and Tony , oblivious to all around him sometimes, said he didn't see anything)  I got called into my supervisors office when I returned from the trip.  It seems another flight attendant saw me and wrote me up...she thought I had something shaved into the side of my head!!!  After that embarrassing ordeal, I decided when I got home I had no choice but to shave off all my hair.  Right now I look like Powder (but not as skinny or as wierdly hot) cuz I have not hair or eyebrows.  A few days later, the doctor called and said he got some of my lab work back.  He asked if I was sure of my HIV diagnosis.  I should point out that this is the doctor that I didn't like very much anyway.  I laid into him... of course I am sure, I have been living with it for over 2 years.  He let me finish, and explained that in researching my records he has found that every time my counts had been done (only when I was really sick) that my CD4 count (t-cells for those of you not in the know) would be all over the place... sometimes super high, other time super low.  My viral load is a different story...it has always been undetectable.  My new docs theory was I was too sick for my viral load to be undetectable... it would go against what HIV is all about.  It's sole purpose is to wait for the body to be weakened and then replicate and attack, but that wasn't happening.  He asked if he could do another HIV test.  I told him I thought he was crazy but I would consent to the test.  What I didn't tell him was that I had gone to the Holmes Clinic in Cincinnati (and HIV research hospital) for a second opinion right after I had seen him the first time.  The clinic had taken a ton of blood for various tests, and some extra because I had consented to be used for studies.  I called the clinic and told the doctor there what the other doctor said...he promised he would call as soon as he got my lab results back.  he called the next day and told me that he thought perhaps my doc was on to something, my counts were virtually the same (very high CD4 and no viral load) he sent my study blood off to be tested for HIV proper.  Now would be a good time to point out the history of my infection...after I found out I was positive (I had expected it to be poz) I freaked out.  I got scared and never went back to a doctor till I got really sick and had no choice.  I would placate friends with fake doctors visits cuz they wanted to know I was taking care of myself... but the fact of the matter is I HATE doctors and I was scared, so I would just say "good news, counts are great" and move on...never actually knowing what my counts were.  When I would get really sick I would reluctantly go to the doctor and tell him "by the way, I am HIV+ just in case that has anything to do with this"  The doctor would say ok and run my counts just to be sure the HIV wasn't out of control, and would always report just as my new doctor pointed out, various CD$ counts and undetectable viral load... to the unsuspecting doc that was great news.  It meant the HIV was not taking over and it would be easy to treat whatever I was sick with.  Fast Forward.  Lab calls back and the doctor confirms there is no HIV... I am HIV-.  The bad news is, that there is obviously an immune deficiancy problem, but they don't know whats causing it.  The good news, I don't have AIDS.  I didn't know if I should be happy, angry, sad, or scared.  For over 2 years, HIV has ruled my life, it has completely shaped who I am and affected all my relationships.  One of my dearest friends in the world came about because of an unfortunate situation regarding my HIV and his boyfriend (now of the ex variety).  All of my friends had only known me as poz.  My pledge brothers helped me deal with the news, my pledgemaster quietly keeping me from slipping into a bottomless pit of depression at the hand of the disease that I was convinced was going to take my life and that I would inadvertantly pass to all those that I cared for.  My big brother getting visably angry when I compared my body to a toxic waste barrell and if the skin were punctured the poison would leak out and infect everyone close to me.  I was suddenly faced with "oh by the way, nevermind."  In my mind, at the time, this news undid all of those relationships.  In my mind the foundation for those relationship was just taken away.  I was clearly not thinking in the right direction...I was trying to trivialize my friendships into being about something physical, for a brief moment I forgot that all of my friends and relationships have a much stronger foundation than a virus that may or may not be, but rather built on a foundation of honesty and trust, and mutual respect.  The vast majority of people I call my friends are my Brothers...each one pledged to treat friendship and brotherhood with the most love and compassion that can be musterd.  I have found that the few friends that I have that are not brothers have the same respect and compassion for friendship as the men of my fraternity.  I realized that I can't undo the last 2 years, I can only learn from them, and move forward.  I have a lot more to say on this, but I will wait for another post.  In the meantime, Andrew, Ernie, Tony, Matthew, Dominick, thanks for being my foundation, and helping me keep it all real and in focus...
