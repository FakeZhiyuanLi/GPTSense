      I've been wanting to learn how to play the piano recently. It's just that, it produces such beautiful sounds that it's just bliss to the ears. My grandmother taught me how to play it when I was 5 or 6, but I decided not to continue it. Now I'm regreting that decision. Wouldn't you wish that you could just turn back time and correct your mistakes? ... I would.  I've been lacking sleep recently. Mainly because of stubborness and laziness. I could do my homework immediately after I come home from school, instead, I just bum around... even though I've got tons of homework to do. Cramming has just grown on me ever since the first day of school. I could do my homework right away, I know I'm perfectly capable of doing it... it's just that I'm too stubborn to do just that.   I'm a very lazy person, sometimes I'm even too lazy to go to sleep(weird right)... to get ready for sleep actually. For atleast 30 minutes, I'm just on my bed lying down... when I could have that 30 minutes for sleep, instead I just lie down. Sometimes I'm not even thinking while just lying down, just staring blankly into space as if I have no feelings, like an inanimate object. I want to get rid of it, but I just got used to doing it. It's one of my bad habits that I want to get rid of, especially cramming.  That's my eight post so far, I hope whoever is reading didn't find it weird, I was just thinking of things to post so I'm sorry if you didn't like it...

      Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin    There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed  With a word she can get what she came for.  Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.   There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure  'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.  In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.  Ooh, it makes me wonder,  Ooh, it makes me wonder.   There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,  And my spirit is crying for leaving.  In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,  And the voices of those who stand looking.  Ooh, it makes me wonder,  Ooh, it really makes me wonder.   And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune  Then the piper will lead us to reason.  And a new day will dawn for those who stand long  And the forests will echo with laughter.   If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,  It's just a spring clean for the May queen.  Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run  There's still time to change the road you're on.  And it makes me wonder.   Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,  The piper's calling you to join him,  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.   And as we wind on down the road  Our shadows taller than our soul.  There walks a lady we all know  Who shines white light and wants to show  How everything still turns to gold.  And if you listen very hard  The tune will come to you at last.  When all are one and one is all  To be a rock and not to roll.   And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

      Ever had that feeling that something wrong is bound to happen? Or that feeling you get when you're waiting anxiously to happen, when it's so close you can taste it? Ever had the feeling of rejection? Acceptance? Joy? Sadness? Fear? Anger? All these feelings all make us feel differently somehow. Some hate to be rejected while others are used to it. You know what I'm talking about. Feelings sometimes hurt. Sometimes it's a good feeling. But there's this feeling that outshines all of these feelings... It's being with you. It's irreplacable. I can never get tired of being with you. You make me feel special. You're an angel here on earth. You're a blessing. I can never trade the feeling of being with you for any other feeling. And I know that this feeling within me is true.    I love you Angeline.

      Dust in the Wind by Kansas  I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone  All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity  Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind  Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea  All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see   Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind   Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky  It slips away, all your money won't another minute buy   Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind   ------------------------------------------------------   Isn't it interesting? One moment were just brought into this world by our parents, the next thing that happens is that everybody you love will die one by one... including yourself. Death is a strange thing. Why do we have to die? What is the purpose of all this? Is it all just a state of mind? Are we all not just some illusion or fantasy thought up by someone? In some way though, we are all like dust in the wind. Were here right now, then the next were gone. All these questions may have an answer, answers that we may never know. Death is a mystery. One thing is certain though... we will all go through it.

      Yesterday, Arf told me that he had a brown slip because he failed an English quiz. That had me worried about myself. I know I failed a quiz in CL but I don't want my parents to be aware that my grades are slipping these past few weeks. The reasons is because I don't want my parents to take away the perks that I have during weekdays like getting to watch TV. Recently, my mind is on guitar tabs and and a game called Dynasty Tactics 2 that I can't stop playing on weekends. I just can't focus when it comes to studying. Then if I get bored of studying, I get my guitar and play for at least 30 minutes. Then I go back to studying. But after a few minutes, by hands are itching to play the guitar. Then I just forget about studying and just continue playing until I fall asleep. So until I get some control on this, I don't guarantee an improvement on my grades.  I have this song stuck in my head right now. It's called "I Hate to Say I Told You So" by The Hives. It's not the lyrics, it's not the vocals... it's the tune. Somehow, I just find it so great and cool. I found the tabs of the song last week then I saw that it was just 4 power chords repeated over and over. But it wasn't bad, the simplicity of it made me realize that if I were to compose some tunes, it doesn't have to be something like "Sweet Child of Mine" or something by Jimi Hendrix, even the simplest tunes can come out very beautiful when it comes to rock.   That's it for my third post. Thanks to for reading(whoever is reading).

      When I first saw you... I thought that you couldn't be real, how could something so beautiful could be so real... so perfect. But then I stopped and thought how could  something so unreal could be so caring and beautiful... Then I realized you were not someone from a fairy tale, whose beauty and personality knows no bounds... you're a dream come true...         We had our class outreach a while ago, and it was great. Most of the were very kind and hospitable and the whole trip was ok. But I kind of feel fortunate. While I'm here bitching about stuff I don't have, poor people are ok with their lives even though they are unfortunate. It kinda makes me feel terrible. The whole purpose of the outreach program finally came to me after that experience, and I think it did to my other classmates too...   Right now, I'm listening to a Woodstock CD. And I can't believe the sounds coming out of our computer's speakers! Jimi Hendrix was playing his guitar like it was an extension of his arm! Arf said sarcastically that in a a couple of years, he could become better than Jimi Hendrix. But I think that's downright impossible... nobody can be better than Jimi Hendrix! It's a shame he died young because of some "magic powder"...  The other day on the bus, I heard "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand and it rocked! While listening o the song, thoughts like "How did they come up with this?" and "Is this for real?". I can't write songs for squat, while all the bands come up with such great songs and it just makes me wonder... Will I ever get this good? I know I'm still young but I've got dreams of making it as a music artist but I don't think I can. I've tried making tunes and some lyrics but everything that I compose usually ends up in disaster as far as I'm concerned. Maybe I just need more time...  That's it for my second post... I hope whoever is reading found it ok.

      Well, this is my very first post. It may not be too insightful as other blogs but it's a start.   Tomorrow will be my class's outreach. I'm not that exited mainly because I've been lacking sleep for the past few days because of my stubborness. I keep playing the guitar before my homework so I usually end up cramming the next day. Another is that I can't cook. We are all required to cook and I fear that I might accidentally set the food I'm cooking on fire. But as far as being excited, I just can't explain it. Is it maybe because of the possibility of something bad happening... or is it something else. Now I'm getting confused...    We had our club a while ago... and for the first time this schoolyear, I actually didn't find it that dreadful... But still, I regret taking violin lessons instead of learning the guitar. I'm enjoying the guitar more than the violin right now. But if I'm to quit right now, I might regret the 5 years I've spent playing the violin. So it's like a double-edged sword- either way, I lose.   Recently, I've been reading this book called "Behind Sad Eyes, The Life of George Harrison". It's kind of weird. After these past few months of being a fan of the Beatles, it's just now that I'm reading the book that I really knew someting about George Harrison. John Lennon was the rebellious kind of guy who was successful even as a solo artist, Paul Mcartney was the sensitive kind of guy, when paired with John Lennon in songwriting were quite the duo. Ringo Starr was the happy-go-lucky guy who would say yes to anything. While George Harrison was the Shy Beatle, the Quiet Beatle or maybe even the Sad Beatle. It was weird for me, he had fame, girls adored him and he was admired all around the world. It's just weird for me.   Well... that's it. I hope whoever is reading found it ok. (but I doubt anyone would read this...)

      I have a lot on my mind lately... I always tend to get frustrated. My test scores reached an all-time low, I failed 2 filipino tests in a row and my grades always seem to be just mediocre. Lack of sleep and constant fights with my little brother, it just keeps on going... and I think my head is gonna explode. Well, atleast it's Thursday, another day of school then I get my 10 hours or so of sleep... but then there's the T.H.E. project.   I've been frequently listening to The Cure since Monday. I've heard the band before, but now that I'm listening to their music more, I sometimes go on a trance. I'm just sitting there, listening to their music, staring blankly into space and not minding anything else. Their unlike any band I've heard before. The lyrics, the guitar riffs and solos, the drum beat, the bass guitar and the keyboards. It sends chills to my spine (espescially in the song "Just Like Heaven").   It's just not the same. I'd look where you are, but you're not there. It makes me feel empty, knowing you're nowhere near me. I long for the moment when your eyes meet mine, then I know everything is great again. I miss you.

      She's Always a Woman  by Billy Joel  She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes,  She can ruin your faith with her casual lies,  And she only reveals what she wants you to see.  She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me.   She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you,  She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you,  And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free,  Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me.   Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants,  She's ahead of her time.  Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in,  She just changes her mind.   And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden  then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding,  But she brings out the best and the worst you can be.  Blame it all on yourself cause she's always a woman to me.   Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants,  She's ahead of her time.  Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in,  She just changes her mind.   She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel,  She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool,  But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree,  And the most she will do is throw shadows at you  But she's always a woman to me.
