      LTNT.. Just came back from tution wahh... Super tired, imagine sleeping at 2am and waking up at around 6.45am in the morning for school, haii...why secondary school must start so early unlike primary school in the afternoon. Tried my plan..but didn't work, so in school tried to survive in class, and got caught sleeping a few times by my teacher. After school, I had to rush my lunch and run off to church to collect my art piece that I left in Matt's Office. Worst thing is that i had forgotten to write my name on the art piece..*sign*   Rushed back home to collect my tution stuff, and went for tution, wah...tired sia.. anyway its 2 hours, and FINALLY i back home..wah...shiok..

      yoyo..so hows life for you all..its Great and also Bad for me..ya talk about my bad..the bad is about staying back after school for remeders from nowonwards..its horrible i tell you..why some of you might ask..as most of you know that i hate school and don't like being part of any activity. And worst thing is that i had paid for my tution and than the school decided to have remeders, so...the Great thing about now its that i finally had said i have been wanting to say to my wg (all together) i thankfull for what God has done in my wg, as many of them are starting to pick up their Bible and read. Also want to thankHim for strengthening me at times of need. Ya..back to topic..>>> It all began at church, at around 2pm, i was still doing my homework when God sent someone to help me in my homework(wahhh..), its Jonathan Quek(the 1 who broke my ruler) came to rescue. He(Jonathan) taught me quite a lot of methods in my HW(homework). So i had promised Matthew to babysit  Christorpher  , and after go for Mark's house. So after babysitting   Christorpher  , i went off with Muntat to our destination by bus, Fang Hao came along too on the way. So when we reached there, Mark and Yiren were there at the bus stop to pick us up, i was very happy and crazy when they already booked the pool(NOT SWIMMING POOL) (Hallelujah), i was the first one to play, and was against Yiren(tan tan tan ter..) and i thought Yiren was gona win me as he had some form of trainning with Jimmy(shuai ge), but i won him(thanks to the playstation game)&nbsp;, haha.. anyway the pro there was Fang Hao, i LOST TO HIM(Fang Hao) BY  3 BALLS !!! Haii..now i was the blur 1 as i didn't know how to go back home, and Yiren was the only 1 that live in Bukit Panjang, but he wanted to stay over, so i had to stay(thanks Yiren), ya we were just like the Four Best friends(hur?...4 Best Friends), because you forgot Jesus, His our Best friend. Ya we had fun swimming after 10pm(condo's swimming pool closes at 10pm), we great time for aout 1 hour when we were caught by the security guards and sent to the police, no lahz jk..so i bought  chocolates  for them(Mark and Family) when i gave it to Mark, Yiren ate like about 8  chocolates (please note that it was 1am and its  Forarorosa ) and its like werid to eat  chocolates  at 1am. Haiii...so tired gtg bb tata cya..>>Ohya Remember  LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS  >

      hi there, hmmm.. just wondering.. if Sarah Chan is reading. I hope so.. haha.. She'll love it anyway just want to  urlLink ask you Sarah, why today i sms you about 'i am playing with Christorpher now', and you repiled 'Dad!! Why jan can play with Christopher!!' And I replied' huh???Dad???' You replied'Ya la... Wait...I tell my daddy'  Can u see how this girl end her sms, haiiii...anyway  BACK TO MY POINT ..Ok it all started after school, i was walking to Greenridge to buy my lunch back to church to  urlLink "Study Eat"  (Clarice invention)i was walking to towards the yellow bench, (thinking)should i go 3rd floor or stick to plan, so to my surprise. I saw the New Life Staff having fun at the yellow bench(which i plan to "Study Eat" there  ALONE ), so you know i'll become KAPO and pretend to have lunch there, come to think of ya..i actually did have lunch there, they were playing and celebrating the  ONE MONTH CELEBRATION THING . So after having lunch, i went to the 3rd floor to study(please note that it's not "Study Eat" but STUDY), then by now you'll should be thinking why am i studying in church and not at home, the reason is that i had to help Joshua(SunBeam) to take off the old tape that was on the floor of SunBeam Hall, so ya la..thats why i'm there..Ok ok BACK TO STORY, i studied for a while when Matthew Lo with his wife Rebbecca came up from lift, and that starts the day with the Lo Family, ya..Matt also asked me out for Dinner&nbsp;with his family&nbsp;that night, so i at first told i can't make it. (that time Matthew knew what was going the day before) so i continued doing my work and study, when Joshua came with a BAD News, that was.. that the Hall wasn't clean before we could paste the tape to the ground. Ya lo then he left, so i continued studying and doing homework, at around 3.26pm(wow so accurate) i finished EVERYTHING(Wahhh..>>STRESS Christopher ) and was searching for  Christopher   when i FOUND him. Hahaha i was playing with him and&nbsp;he was&nbsp;telling me what had happen and also how much he missed me(Ohhh...SO CUTE!!!) me too&nbsp;was missing him BADLY because i haven't seen him for 2 WEEKS!!! Its very long, and&nbsp;then i thought to my since i finished my homework. I could go with them for dinner ya...(Muahahaha.. Sarah should be jealous by now )..so i sms Matt and also called him, but..no answer, so i waited until 6.53pm when FINALLY God Blessed me by senting Matthew down and picking Chris up. So when Rebecca came, we left for Matt's car, it was a bit scary for Chris to go in a lift(he scared of lifts noises). So in the car Chris was asking for his scheldue on eating and in the car he was sososososo afraid that we are not going to eat that he cried, so Matt said:" Chris, don't cry Daddy is going to bring to eat." When after that sentence Chris started asking for his scheldue again..haha...so we went Macdonals to have Dinner, ya lo thats about the interesting part of this day..ok by3 got to go now its late and I HAVE SCHOOL tommorow, ya Plz leave your Comments here, right here, Only Here\/ ok by3..

      hi..again..just want to thank everyone for reading(Not Really), joking..ya..It's a really Great Refreshening, these past two days: Sunday and Monday. Ya.. the Lord has really spoke to me and taught me. Lets talk about Sunday, ya..i responded to the alter-call, as there was a feeling of repentness, there was something stirring in my heart, i know that thats was the Holy Spirit. Then someone came to pray for me, it was Themis, ya he was praying for all the the anger, hurts and pains that i went through..i realise God is now giving everyone a Love that we can Really feel the person, that we are praying for, pain and also can see what is he/she going through. So i really want to say, we MUST treasure this Gift from Him, ya i was not really broken down on Sunday. But on the Push Up Night, we were in groups of 3 or 4, i was with Matthew and Themis, i was first to be pray for, Themis prayed for me first, while he was praying the i could feel the Holy Spirit. Then, suddenly Matthew ask me:" Hows your relationship with your father." i was Really Stunted by that, because that was what i been wishing for to share with but..couldn't..I then told him all the things..which was..so..so..so..painful..to..express..i was really broken at that time..it was the first time i..really..cried..out..so..painfully, broken, and it..was difficult for me to..express..my feelings towards my father and family..after that Matthew explain what was going on, on how he knew about my relationship with my family, he said that the Lord told him about my real Deep..PAIN, inside of me.. Then Matt told me what he is going to do, after he prayed for me, and while praying he told me think about all the Bad thing i said, done and bad thoughts about my father, i then thought of all these things coming back to me, its like the Lord shinning his Light onto all these Dark areas, Matt then said:"Jan, i want to imaging all these things going into your hands, i want you to take your time, don't rush. Ok." Then i saw that all of these Sins, that i have been holding on to, going into my hands. Matt then said:"Now, Lift all these to God." i saw all these going to God, i felt so free ever so free. Ya i was thanking the Lord so much about it. So i Firstly want to thank God for sending Your Son to die for our Sins, Secondly i want to thank God for telling Matthew how i feel and thirdly i want to thank everyone especially, Matthew, Themis, Galvin, Johny, Huai Tze and many more.. Also want to thank readers reading about my life, and i really Hope that whoever drops by PLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS..THANKS..

      hi..it me again..ya woke up at around 7.26am for the 8am service..ya learned something important from the service..it was about 'The Father-Heart Of God' ya as some of you know that i am hot-tempered person and that i very very very against my father on earth..ya i just can't his attutite and ways. But throughout everything i've learned, it always apply to the way of treating your parents by honouring them and obeying them. But i the type of person who likes FREEDOM ya..i know that i already have a lot of freedom that was given by parents but i still think that that is not enough. I learned through the counselling by many many people and EVEN MY MOM. Ya after reading i realise how a father treats their children but in a different way(its a man thing), ya i learn from the story of Galvin, God gave me a glimpse of how my father has treated me and i how i treated him back. And that no parents are perfect.   urlLink Now I just want to apologise to you pa of all the things i've done and mostly the way i treated you. And i thank you for what you've done for me, and all the times you want to have a father to son conversation with me which i refused. I also want to thank you mom for talking and explaining to me of what you all are going through all the time, all the problems that i always ignored. I just want to say to all of you all, even you ko, that you all have indeed change me and my ways, I WANT TO THANK YOU.    Ya and for all of you(Friends and Leaders), i just need time to get use to you of that everyone is different in their own ways. Ya Matthew and the clays i do hope you will teach me and will guide to walking a straight path towards God and that i will be more forgiving and that i will REALLY SURRENDER to God. Thanks

      hElLo..hello?!..hElLoOoOoO!!!..r u there(knock knock)..haha..jk..anyway its ME and my BORING TRUE STORY TELLING(zZzZzZ..)..So it all begin in the morning when i BADLY DURSTURB by my parents from my WONDERFUL SLEEP, to go to the making passport centre ya..at first we(parents and me) planned that i would go with my dad, ALL OF A SUDDEN my mom came alone. It was like i was a crimenal(don't know how to spell) that was very roughty that TWO person MUST GO with ME!!! Haiii..don't know la they(parents) very FUNNY want. When i finished updating my passport, my mom suddenly wanted to go her sister's place for "A WHILE" which was in Ang Mo Kio. At around 12pm i went to play bbal(basketball) at the bbal court nearby, i met a few of my Ah Bang friends i knew through bbal at there. So i started playing with them, while playing bbal they were saying out all the foul lauguage and they were doing things like kicking the rubbish bins and littering. So at that time i started recalling my past..even worst than them, now i was the only QUAE kid there who change after God's working on me, i was sort of sad when they were doing all these stuff that i too had done. Ya then after all of that i FINALLY reached Bukit Panjang, and i set off to church to wait for some of them going to the movie later. Ya then we went off in a cab/taxi to westmail to have dinner first then to the MOVIES.. Before that Galvin was telling me to watch out for things to learn from the movie Spider Man 2. At first, i didn't believe what he said like LEARNING SOMETHING FROM THE MOVIE, so after the movie i learn that if you have greed in your life example, money, you have to pay a price with that example, your love ones's life, ya..also i learn to give up my dreams sometimes and REALLY FOCUES on following God. Ya so now i know that EVEN MOVIES can teach you a few things..haha..and after the movie we went to the coffeeshop there to have supper and also chat, ya i really thank God for bringing us there because i got to know about Mark Lim, Jason and Joshua better, i also got to know better about God and also i learn that we are more than a reflector. Ya if u'll want to know more can ask me. Ya i also want to say that God has REALLY WORKED in my life, as things are actually very bad condition but God has taught me how to use His ways to make life much easier ya lo i go to go sleep lao..tommorrow go to wake up at 7am for 8am service..ya so if want to contact me add in your msn messenger at sclub7bluered@hotmail.com ok good day..b3e....

      hihi..AGAIN..joking la..anyway..BEFORE i tell you what happen, please look up for sign boards telling you what to say ok thxs..today something happen today and thats was a miracle and also an answered prayer. That thing is that on my way down, from my Dad's car, from Jurong East(after tution, so STRESSFUL), there was always traffic jam on my way down usually, but there wasn't any traffic today(sign board:"WoW!!!Amen!"). And the best thing about the WHOLE thing is that, i have been praying for my Dad..one of them was for him to DRIVE FASTER as he only drives at 50km/h ALWAYS!!! BUT today he DROVE FASTER(sign board:"AMEN!!!"), and i manage to reach in church 15mins!!! When i usually reach church in half-an-hour..So ok..let me talk about the retooling ok(sign board:"THANK YOU!!!")..i learn that we should treat everyone whelther christian a not, i learn that we should forgive, to accept one another differences, build up relationship, to be kind to everyone, and many many many many MORE!!! I also learn the primary roles as a fellow pigrim, example all of us regardless being poor or rich that all if us are going the same journey. Ya..i also learn that i should continue bringing backslided christian and non-christian, who have already came to church, TO CHURCH. Through all this section i also learn a new word called 'Hayin' which means Life haha..I learn the most important thing is how to 'CARE' for others like how to connect with each other, how to be accountable, how to reach out, and lastly how to edify the "person's" problem through our experience. Ya and i was Truely truely encourage by both Joshua, from web, and Yiren, the WISE guy. Ya lo..i just want to thank them for encouraging me(sign board: Clap!).

      hihi..today i wana share with u all what has the Lord done in me, n who is this man called Jesus Christ whom we worship, n also how can it change everyones life, this TRUE STORY is meant for u yes u, u ,the one looking around..ok enough with my crap.. it all starts when i was 4 years-old, i was born a second generation Christian(have not accept Jesus Christ). I went to church every Sunday because I was forced to come by my parents, back then i was the naughties kid, in church and in Teck Whye, that u cannot even imagine even a little bit, i would destroy anything n everything i see, n i would also go around looking for animals to throw things , beat, kick n even pour cold/hot water on it, when it did nothing(but this was only the beginning). At the age of 6 nobody, nobody, ya, did i say nobody, ya NOBODY taught me the F word, i sure all of u will know what it is ya..i started saying this word to everybody n i also say this to my family..i was also bullying people older than me even!(can u imagine that). Then at the age of 7, my best friend taught me how to steal, i started stealing at school, home and even in church(the holy place). I started a gang in school, n i was the head of all the gangsters in my gang, we always do many many many many many many many many many many stuff that i not telling u(its too EVIL to be said).. we always had gang fights outside school(near our school)(it was very fun to do all this but there was something empty inside of me that i don't know what was it), n always got into a lot of trouble with the school Principle, i at that time realize i didn't had THE LOVE, but i had many Girlfriends but they couldn't give that LOVE i wanted..i did all these things until the age of 13(sec 1)..i trasfered to another church called Covenent Evangelical Free Church.. then i got into the Youth Ministry known as YPM, i realized i had a man name Jesus who went through a lot a lot a lot of trouble just to say He loved me n even u, i then had many Questions, so i continue going to church, n the more i go the more i hear about Him of what he had DONE 2004 years ago from 2004, n i accept Jesus Christ as my personal saviour, n the MOST BEST thing about it, is that that empties in me was filled with the LOVE i have long wanted..i now to introduce this man called Jesus to u, He loves u very very very much, that He died on the cross for our sins, n He did not do anything wrong but was crusified by us, so that we will be accepted by God in Heaven n that we will be always loved by Him.. if there is something sturring in ur heart now.. say this prayer in ur heart : "Dear Lord Jesus, I admit i am a sinner and i need your forgiveness. I belive that you died for my sins on the cross. I now open the door of my life and invite you in to be my Savior and Lord. I thank you for forgiving my sins and giving me eternal life. Take control of my life from now on. Make me the kind of person You want me to be. I pray this in the name of Jesus, Amen." If u had prayed that prayer ask go to any church u want n also ask ur Christian friend to teach u more. SOoooo bye bye, tata, so long farewell.. n do visit a guy name galvin website n read more about his testimonies at www.galvin.worshipsingapore.com ok see u, plz do leave ur comments here thxs..

      wah.... me SUPER tired..anyway hi to all. Ya this is a real GREAT NIGHT, as i could stay up early(6am) for a purpose, that is PRAY! And had get to know some people more. Ya..lets talk about the begining...  Sunday 6.30am: Alarm rang.. i switch it off, and went back to sleep. 6.40am: Alarm rang again..i switch it off, and went back to sleep. 6.45am: Alarm rang again!..blah blah blah.(same thing) 6.50am: Alarm rang for the FOURTH TIME!!! Finally woke up, went to toliet. Do morning stuff(not BIG..that one). 7.00am: Alarm rang FOR THE FIVETH TIME!!!!!! So glad i had exchanged my phone with Jimmy(Got 5 LOUD ALARMS). 7.15am: Expected Mark Cheong to call me.(Asked him the day before to do that)So called him and realise that he had forgotten. 7.20am: Playing with Jimmy's handphone 7.30am: Realize i need to meet Mark, at that time in CHURCH!!! 8.00am: Reached in time for 8am SunBeam. Then Blah..blah..blah..  By lunch time, i had to be in Grace Sanctuary for the prepartion for the service worship. After all the sound checks, i realize i couldn't hear myself *ya..*, why you must be thinking..because the VERY FIRST time i was on stage singing. Dorothy said that i was out-of-tune, so i was afraid that i will sing out-of-tune. Which will bring the whole worship team out-of-tune too, i asked people who were there, Joy and Rachel, whelther they could hear me.  During the altar call, the worship team had to go up to prepare.. so when i was up, it was my very first time seeing the process, >>> Matthew asking everyone to bow down their heads and don't look around, BUT!!! Some People don't understand English, and still stick their heads up, these people i call KAPO! And you are lucky i don't put your name up here..Haha..no insults.. BUT PLEASE OBEY LA!  Ya..so Boring right! Well.. i am a Lamer, most of you should know.. ya BACK TO THE STORY>>> TOYS STORY>>>After the Web service, i went to Greenridge for fun. When i went OCBC and Yiren was there with a few others, another side i saw Jimmy, Alex and a gang of girls. Because Jimmy, my Ah Ko, was there so i joined them, then after they left i went to look for OCBC, when.. THEY'RE GONE!!! I asked around, they said they left, so i called OCBC and realize.. THEY ARE AT THE GYM, when he is suppose to go my house and rest, WHEN HE KNOWS THAT HE IS GOING OVERNIGHT PRAYER!!!  Hai..don't know what to say.. Yiren on the other hand, who sometimes sleeps when he prays during P.U.S.H U.P, also going for overnight prayer also went to exercise. I was left all alone when Galvin, Mark Lim and Sarah Chan came. AMEN!!! So i and Sarah didn't feel like going home, so we left for church to look for CHRISTOPHER!!! At Matthew's office, we left our bags there and left for Greenridge AGAIN!!! Awww.. then we saw..MATTHEW LO, blah..blah..blah..  We(Matt, Sarah, Muntat and ME of course.) went back to church to have a nap, when Matt was already asleep (5 minutes) Muntat left.. Left Sarah and me still awake. Sarah on the other hand was trying to control herself..OF LAUGHING..*werid*.. at Matt sleeping posture, i set the five alarm to 8pm. I manage sleep..for like 1 hour. So by then two of us were awake, why two you must be thinking.. because SARAH WASN'T SLEEPING AT ALL!!! *Crazy Girl*  Matt took a bath..blah..blah..blah.. when Kelvin Choo came back from GYM with Mark and Yiren. Kelvin told us some jokes and all of us went dinner..  After dinner.. I rushed to church to grab the bathing stuff.. and went bathing..  STAY TUNE FOR PART TWO..
