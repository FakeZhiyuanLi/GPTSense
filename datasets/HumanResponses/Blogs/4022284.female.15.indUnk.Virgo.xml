       Went to padre's yearly company picnic.. It's always the same... a bunch of large ladies ogle over howold I am and how old that makes them. When Madre told them I drove us there, they were about to pass out. Driving is a little less nerve racking lately. I feel like I'm starting to get a handle on it...     After the festivities, I&nbsp;  drove   &nbsp;(I   over to Borders and spent my 25$ gift certificate. I bought Kurt Cobain's "Journals" cuz I'd read some of it before and thought it looked cool. Maybe it'll inspire some underlying creativity in me. God knows I need it. Madre bought some huge guide on travelling through Europe. I'm glad they're trying to make some sense of all of it.

       Hola~    Hey palz, switching diaries again. Why? Because I feel like it dammit. Tralala, j/p, I just felt like a change. ~~    Updates on my    fab   &nbsp;life~      Europe trip in a little over 2 weeks baby!! I'm making a list of all the&nbsp;shiznit I need to bring. What does one bring when traveling to different countries? A phrase book.    Italian boys, brittish boys, german boys or french boys? Which ones are hotter??? hachacha     Going to see Delovely tonight at the Senator in Baltimore. It looks really neattt w/ Ashley Judd. She's a rockin actress even if her sister is a complete spaz.     Damn I'm high. High on LIFE that is... I think it's from all this bloody skanking I've been doing lately...  don't ask .     Random ladies walked up to me in the mall the other day, and started complimenting my new ~*DOONEY AND BOURKE*~ purse. Okay okay, I know it's a brand name, but I love it :D     I need to write something MEANINGFUL again. I feel completely drained of all deep thoughts. Damn the&nbsp;summer season&nbsp;and all of&nbsp;its brainwashing tactics. Of course I do love not going to school. I think I do anyway. Oh god...     Still have't killed anyone thus far in my driving practice "hurrah"    Talked to jennifer s from Oakland Mills this morning, she's still as cool as ever. Maybe we'll do something again soon? Hope so...     ~Quizzes~   Take the quiz:  urlLink "Which'>http://www.zenhex.com/quiz.php?id=1613">"Which  Daria character are you?"       Jane     You're Jane! Like Daria, you are cynical, intelligent, and talented (you are a budding artist), but you are also a little more open to the world around you. Like any good artist, you constantly explore the passionate and emotional side of the world, which usually translates into exploring -- sometimes impulsively -- various romantic possiblities with boys. Your emotional nature tends to get the better of you, unfortunately, which is probably why a lot of your relationships don't work out the way you want.
