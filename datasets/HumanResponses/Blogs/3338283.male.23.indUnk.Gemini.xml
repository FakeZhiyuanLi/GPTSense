           The gently rolling grass, crossed and dotted with wildflowers, laid comfortably beneath a crisp blue sky littered with puffy white clouds.  A young boy, age five, stood alone in its expanse.  His jet-black hair flowed in the light fragrant breeze.  His stormy blue eyes and mischievous smile begged for adventure.  Yes, this was his kingdom and the ragged brown teddy bear dangling from his left hand was his chief minister.  The trees were his guards, the insects and animals his populace, and the Sun a humble advisor who rose early to greet him and bowed out at the end of the day.  After all, what is a king without subjects?  His name was Daemon and this was his world.       Still, even royalty isn’t above mommy.  She called his name and Daemon came running.  He flew over miniature mountains with all the speed his little legs could muster and was rewarded to see his home rise slowly from the ground.  The house had a neutral tone stone façade and a white back porch that greeted him.  His mother rose into view, smiling and sipping her lemonade; he smiled and pushed forward a little harder so he could reach her sooner.  Then he saw them, two uniformed Center personnel.       “You should be very proud Mrs. Prince.  Your son is only one of a handful to ever perform flawlessly on the preliminary examinations.  I am quite certain that he will rank as a tier one cadet,” said the brown haired Brillo head with bushy eyebrows with a pin number of 160.  He looked young, but looks are particularly deceiving in this day and age.  He wore a traditional officer uniform; a navy blue jacket with platinum buttons, matching pants, slick black shoes, and a white collarless shirt with such posture that made his smart clothing look remarkably stupid.  Three platinum stars displayed his tier one rank, and the Center insignia rested on his heart.  The other, a slightly older looking sandy blonde with a pin number of 164, was of the same rank and similarly dressed, but managed an air more befitting his calling.  He rolled his eyes at his companion’s prattle and directed his attention toward Daemon.       Daemon slowed to a stop, his eyes watered, and tears started flowing freely down his tender cheeks.  He looked to Mommy seeking a shred of hope, but instead saw an expression of sorrow and eyes that expertly restrained tears.  “No!!!” he shrieked as he turned and bolted for the woods.  Tears blurred his vision and he desperately tried to wipe the ocean from his eyes.  He had only gone several paces when a firmly planted stone stopped his right foot dead in its tracks and sent him hurtling forward.  He braced himself for the inevitable crash, arms cradling his head, but none came.  He slowly unwrapped his head, blue eyes still pouring, and stared below in complete horror…  He was suspended in midair while his tears fell gently to the earth.       “Don’t worry Mrs. Prince, this is a rather common necessity.  Daemon won’t be hurt or punished,” said the brown haired one with well-practiced arrogance as he looked at Daemon and cocked his head to one side.  Daemon started to float toward him despite much initial kicking, struggling, and indignant protestation naturally followed by quiet sobbing.  The sandy blonde flicked his wrist and a wheel-less carriage that looked more like a floating steel cage materialized from thin air, and he alighted the craft.       “We must be on our way,” the brown haired announced.  He paused for a moment and then added rather after the fact, “Please don’t say goodbye Mrs. Prince, it only makes children more difficult,” and then proceeded to walk up three invisible steps into the carriage, towing Daemon, who waved a resigned goodbye to mommy, closely behind him.        The interior was made entirely of a smooth and soft transparent blue material and provided no hint of any frame or metal exterior.  Consequently, it gave unobstructed views in all directions, including directly below, which was something that suited Daemon very nicely as it gave him an ever changing, if monotonous, sight to look upon as he sat and sulked.  The trio had been traveling for an hour already and could have easily arrived by now, but it was common practice to extend the trip, as it was an intimate environment that made it easier to impress upon impressionable young minds.       “Daemon, my name is Gooden,” said the Brillo head, “Would you like to see a trick or learn a little about the Center?”       Daemon didn’t respond.       “Something to eat?” he added with a ridiculous smile.       Daemon wished desperately that Gooden would just shut up.       Gooden attempted to rouse Daemon several more times, but to no avail.  Considerably miffed, Gooden turned to the sandy blonde and whined, “Why won’t he answer me?” “Gooden, just shut up for goodness’ sake,” the sandy blonde snapped and then hastily added, “I can think of a dozen reasons without putting much thought into it, not the least of which is that you are incredibly annoying.  Either try a new tactic or concede defeat!”       The sandy blonde was now roused and up for the challenge.  He decided to try his luck on the boy.  “Hello Daemon.  My name is Adrian.  Why won’t you answer my friend Gooden?” he asked.       “You’re a liar!” Daemon replied.       “How impertinent.  I haven’t lied to you!” Adrian shot back.       “Double liar!!”       “How?”       “Gooden isn’t your friend; you hate his guts!”       Adrian smiled broadly and proffered an apology, “I’m sorry.  I did lie to you, and I do hate his guts.  From now on I’ll be more careful to be honest with you, especially considering that the truth makes itself known whether I will it or not.”  Gooden glared at Adrian.  The revelation that Adrian hated his guts was rather an unpleasant surprise.  Adrian, catching the glare, made a short laugh and resumed the aborted interrogation, “So, why won’t you answer Gooden, especially considering your relative willingness to talk with me.”       Daemon smiled and looked down at the ground rolling away beneath him, paused for dramatic effect, looked up and stated, “Gooden has nothing to offer me… and I talk to you just for fun.”       Adrian muttered, “Five years old,” then turned to Gooden, smiled consolingly, and said, “He’s obviously done with us… on to the Center.”
