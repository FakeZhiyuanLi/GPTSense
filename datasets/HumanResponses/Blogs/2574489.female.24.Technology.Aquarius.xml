      I think it's safe to say I din't make healthy food choices today. I went to a party and can hardly keep track of what I ate.  Breakfast..didn't wake up early enough  Lunch...A spicy chicken sandwich, fries, iced tea  Dinner and snacked on food thereafter...Caesar's salad with fat free dressing (at least fat free!), chips and salsa, chicken wings, half a hamburger, 2 cups of rice, a bite of deer sausage...much much later, some more chips and dip, and some tres leches cake...ay leche!  Alcohol intake...2 shots of  Tres Generaciones  tequila, a glass of blended margarita, a glass of fuzzy navel.  Physical Activity...because I knew that I would possibly be eating in a not-so-healthy fashion, I made sure I got in about  30 minutes  of treadmill activity. Burned  300 calories . Also played volleyball while tipsy, and danced up a storm.

      Its another slow day at work.  We have about 6 people on vacation.  In an office numbering 20+ that's a lot of people.  Last night I got so engrossed learning about all the features of this blog that I didn't even notice when it was time to go home.  I looked at my computer clock flashing at me.  Whoopeee! I slinked to the garage where I park and made sure the matronly attendant at the exit had gone home for the day before I could get in my car and drive off.  It's $10 a day parking at this garage and I'm cheap/broke.  So far my luck has held for 3 mos. and I have been forced to pay only one time.  That was last Tuesday.    We had gotten out of work early, I went with some of my co-workers to a bar for some drinks (I just had a Dos Equis).  I tried to get the irritatingly perky waitress there to validate my parking stub but she said that they don't validate after 2 pm.  Fine, I went to the theatre across the garage to buy a movie ticket where they will validate after a ticket purchase.  I figure $6 is better to pay than $10.  I walked up to the booth.  Me:Do you validate a parking stub if i have a movie ticket? Booth Lady: Yes.  (She picks up her stamp and hovers it over the stub I had pushed across our divide) Booth Lady: You got a ticket? Me (thinking quickly):Yes.  Booth Lady stamps my parking stub.  Whoopee!  Smugly, I drive up to the exit booth and present my stamped parking ticket to the lady (not my usual matronly lady).  Unusual lady: It'll still be $10. You parked too long here.  Shyet!  Okay, so back to last night.  I untangled myself from the snare of the parking charge and drove twenty minutes home to my new apartment with boxes still scattered around.  I promised myself I wouldn't be lazy anymore once I moved into my new apartment.  I wouldn't want my husband to accuse me of being lazy again.  So I cooked (warmed up some ready-to-eat stuff), I washed dishes (threw them in the dishwasher) took care of the rest of the boxes (hid them in a closet) and tidied around the house (supervised my brother tidying).    My brother is having separation anxiety.  He'll be moving back home next Monday.  I am having separation anxiety because he does the laundry.  And he's damn good too.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a dream.  I have a dream that one day my weblog will look cool, with pics, and graphics, and that I'll figure out how to create borders and highlights around my text.  I have a dream that sidebars and borders will meet and hold hand in hand and that people will flock to witness this miracle.  And when they flock, they can sign a guest book.   LOL!  Note to self: learn HTML programming or get someone else to program my weblog to look the way I want.    Self asks: When between work, between working toward your MCSE, keeping house, and reading your latest Dean Koontz book, will you have to read up on HTML programming?    Self answers: We will make time.  The force is strong in us.    By they way, I highly recommend Dean Koontz's  Odd Thomas .  Link to Dean Koontz's site to read more about it.

       Ummm...Testing!  Testing Blog This!  Below is one of my favorite sites:   urlLink CNN/Money   -------------------------------------------------------- Adding more stuff....I think I'm gonna like this blogging thing. I love to talk but there's the small problem of no one to listen to me.  Let's see, I have my husband, Woody and my brother, Rhy, who are probably the only two people in the world with whom I do not run out of things to talk about.  But when I talk to them, they insist on talking back. Even when I'm not asking questions.  Even after I interrupt them.  I'll say something and they'll insist on returning the favor by saying something related to what I just said. (Who cares what happened to you, I'm talking about what happened to me!)  Anyway, ode to Da Ganda whose posts inspired me to start blogging. She can be found here  urlLink daganda   I think she (daganda) may be quite popular and have a large circle of friends/acquaintance to read her blog.  I only have my husband and my brother.

       My first time... blogging, that is   Hey! My very first time blogging.  I saw someone's blog on the internet and it was surprisingly interesting even if they're not a celebrity or anything.  Weird, ha! No history, just plunge right into what I'm doing:  I'm sitting at work, getting paid for doing nothing! Hah  It's the 29th of December and people are still on vacation, we're not getting any psychologists or technicians or students or teachers to call us with their problems.  I'm Tech Support for a software company.  Anyway, we had a five day weekend and then no calls at work...kinda nice....but-- we (as in my husband and I) have a lot of work to do at home.  We just moved to a new apartment. And man, it took three f$$$ing days to get 90% done. I didn't mind the packing, its the moving and unpacking that bothered me.  So, I offered to set up our bedroom and bathroom and lingered there until he had finished the living room (the boxes in the living room overwhelmed me--seriously, we had a fort going on there). and by setting up the bedroom I don't mean putting together our bed. I mean, I put sheets on the bed, put up our clothes in the closet, put toilet paper roll on the bathroom toilet paper holder thingamagig.  And I think we blew our budget for this month on eating out...hey! you try finding time to cook on moving day...it's impossible!  We still have to clean out the old apartment or we'll get charged up our butts...you better believe I'll make like a Mister Clean and get that place spotless....La na akong pera (I have no more money)!

      This morning, I woke up to the smells of breakfast cooking.  Husband had woken up early to cook.  I did my morning ritual and then walked out of the bedroom and saw breakfast on the table....SPAM fried in eggs!  I didn't know whether to be touched or annoyed...I chose to be touched.  But I have a sneaking suspicion he was rubbing it in my face that he had done what I had proclaimed I would do but never did....Hmmph!  Anyway, today's Friday Five is interesting:  You have just won one million dollars:   1. Who do you call first?   My husband!   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?   A BMW X5 in silver   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?   Pay off my mother's house so they own it.   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?   Yes. I would give to charity   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?   Definitely invest.  I have been thinking about this a lot.  After setting aside maybe 30% of it in the bank. For the rest, I would put about 60% in stocks (large cap and small cap), including stocks for Walmart, Paycheck, Johnson and Johnson, some QQQs, Index funds and others.  I would put 15% in REIT Funds (Real Estate Funds), and 10% in bond funds, and another 10% in government bonds.  I would also purchase apartment complexes.....Okay, tin, calm down, its a theoretical question.  Have a good weekend everyone!

      So disappointed...my mom just told me that her friend hadn't been able to bring back empanada from the Philippines. I want empanada! My craving for empanada is so strong right now it's painful.  (Hey cousin Shei, send me some! =))  Well at least she brought back hordes of DVDs from my family, ensaymada from goldilocks, and other goodies.  Need to make a trip to Mom's soon.

      I relinked Family X-mas photos and Family in the UK to yahoo photos.  So anyone who could not view it before should have no problems now.   ***  To anybody who does not know about Netflix, it is a DVD service based online.  You choose as many DVDs as you want, they come to you three at a time, and you can keep them as long as you want without any late fees.  Best of all, when you're done, you return it in an envelope provided by Netflix and not have to pay any shipping charges.  All this for $20/month plust tax.  Blockbuster videos are $4.32 each, so if you rent 5 in a month, you would have saved over Blockbuster.    We signed up for said service and last night watched a kickass chick flick from Netflix that Woody and I loved.  The movie was a foreign one, based in Hong Kong, called  urlLink So Close  .  It stars Shu Qui from the Transporter, and two other kickass females.  I love movies like this. (Rhy, we'll rent it again...you HAVE to see these girls).

      Put a commenting tool up. Be nice everyone!  Started reading Brick Lane, and it is very engaging.  I have never read a book about the Pakistani way of life and it is just so interesting.  ***  Two days ago, I promised my husband I would wake up early in the morning and cook him a Filipino breakfast, as in, SPAM dipped in egg and fried ;b, plus sinangag na kanin.  I failed to wake up early enough (8:00 am). Yesterday morning, I got up at 8:50, took a quick shower, peeked into my husband's slumbering figure and told him that it would help a lot if he fixed me my lunch.  So he got up and cooked bacon and toasted bread, and also fixed me my lunch.  I thanked him profusely.  As I was about to leave, he looked at me.  "That was a really good Filipino breakfast!" he joked.  My husband, the joker.  Last night I told him I'd try to wake up this morning and again try to cook him the egg-dripped fried SPAM but this morning I failed again!  ***  I've been trying to read some new people's blogs but I can't seem to get into them.  I don't know why. I can't possibly have tapped all the good blogs out there.  Is it possible I'm blog-saturated because of the ones I already visit?  I'll have to ponder this some more as I continue surfing the net.....

       Motherhood   Last night I expressed my fear to my husband.  Could I handle motherhood?  I'm not so sure.  We're not planning on jumping into having a baby soon but it's been on my mind, and it will happen eventually.  Last night, after work, I managed to drag myself to Walmart, eyes droopy, cranky from the long day.  It was 8:30 pm by the time I got out, and I could hardly muster a smile for the cashier.  When I got home, I put away the groceries and plopped down on the couch, tired. I was tired and I hadn't done anything too taxing.  I had gone to work, did groceries, and I was tired.  If I had children, I would have had to pick them from daycare most likely, feed them, give them baths, entertain them, put them to sleep. I asked myself, how would I have the energy to do all that?  I pushed the disturbing thoughts away, and turned on the computer and spent the next hour and a half scanning pictures and printing them out by trial and error.  While the pictures printed I finished a book.     My husband came home.  We went to bed shortly.  Then in the dark I told him about my fears.    All my life I have never had to take care of anybody.  I've been taken care of by my parents, and now all my husband and I think about is us.  Our desires, our dreams, our plans, our trips.  I cook when I feel like it.  Woody, cooks when he feels like it.  We're not weighed down by demands.  I've no concerns but me. And my husband.  But he's an adult, and in many ways more mature than me.  He takes care of me.  I feel too selfish to be a mother. How would I have time to workout, and mess with the computer, read my books, take trips, have alone time with my husband?    Woody's response was: "let's not have kids"  I groaned.  That is NOT a solution!  But I have nothing but admiration for mothers.  For mine, for every mother who puts their children first.

      It's Monday and everyone knows how hard it is to wake up early on working Mondays.  I waited until the last minute to get up. I took a shower last night before going to bed after my ahem, ahem, workout(!) and so I was able to get away with getting up late.  Over the weekend I: -Cooked dinner for some friends. They swore it was very good but I didn't make enough for seconds.  -Went back to Main Event for bowling (and some more DDR). We had to pair up because we had 9 people on one line. We didn't think about the number of people when we reserved. -Had coffee at starbucks.  -Watched Paycheck...Uma rocks, Affleck sucks. (Sorry to Affleck fans...if there are any) -Visited with my family -Had Woody and my Mom "gang up" on me about not needing a new computer =b -Scanned my wedding pics (the ones that didn't make it into the wedding album).  I'm not done....its gonna be a looooong and slow process.  Update:  It's getting really cold tonight. I have a thin corduroy jacket and I am certain to freeze my butt off on the walk to my car. This morning's mild weather was so deceitful.  And I just forgot to tune into the weather report, worse luck.    After work, I will be off to do groceries at trusty WalMart. Or should I go to Target?  They have mailed me some saver coupons...hmmmmm....we'll see.  I think I'll grab a McD sandwich. I'm famished and can't wait until after doing the groceries!

       Bedroom Fortune   I'm introducing a new feature on my blog called  Bedroom Fortune  in which i chronicle different fortune cookies with the added by-line of  in bed  at the end of it.  Don't know who started that but I learned if from my cousin Shei.  The rule is simple, add the line in bed at the end of your fortune cookies.  I came up with today's very first Bedroom fortune:   Your versatility is your greatest strength ... in bed  from East Buffet restaurant.

      So I just received an email from my mom.  Apparently she has read my blog and I was chastised for talking about "personal things" and for opening my husband to ridicule because of my previous posts.  According to her, "it's funny but it ain't worth it".  So to offset any negative impressions I may have made on my husband by talking about his skivvies, and about his ahem-ahem, thriftiness, I have compiled a list on why I have THE BEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD:  1. He never lets me leave without giving him a hug and a kiss. 2. He wakes up with me even though he works afternoons just so he can cook me breakfast.  3. He eats breakfast with me. 4. He makes lists to remind himself what needs to be done.  He is a list freak. Trust me. 5. He still calls me baby. 6. He lets me call him baby, honey, darling,  pappi , daddy, doofus,  sidi (prince), even weirdo. 7. He panics when he can't get a hold of me at 8 pm. sharp. 8. When he can't get a hold of me (I've cancelled my cellphone) he leaves worried messages on our phone machine. 9. He packs my lunch. 10. He offsets my need to spend with his practicality. 11. He is patient. 12. He puts up with all my foibles, whinings, poutings, unfair criticisms, delusional thinkings, insane accusations, schizophrenic episodes, and maniacal outbursts. 13. He is patient. 14. He is kind. 15. He is patient. 16. He has a kooky sense of humor. 17. We have the same sense of humor. 18. We sometimes think then say the same things at the same time. 18. He never fails to surprise me with his originality. 19. He believes you shouldn't just show your love for someone on one day like Valentine's, it should be everyday. 20. I have a compilation of letters and emails from him that prove what a poet he is. 21. He takes pleasure in the simplest things. 22. He loves the outdoors and nature.   23. He loves Asian things. 24. He loves Filipino things. 25. When he was a little boy, he told everyone he was going to marry a chinese girl.  In his culture, "chinese" encompassed all asians. 26. When he was a little boy, he took a photo of his face and superimposed it on Bruce Lee's body. 27. When he was a little boy, he kept a pair of chopsticks, as one of his prized possessions. 28. He has a blackbelt in Martial Arts. 29. I joke that he should have been born Asian. 30. He's into Tai-Chi. 31. He should have been born Asian. 32. He's patient. 33. And loving 34. And wonderful to curl up beside on cold nights, on warm nights, on any nights! 35. He's patient. 36. Did I mention that he's patient? 37. He is very handsome.  That's it for now....

      My favorite place to hang out and drink coffee in is not Starbucks, which is a favorite among legions in the world.  It's Barnes & Noble.  Whenever I see those green letters overhanging on a building, it is like a beacon of light to me.  It gestures to me without having to flash or twinkle, and says:  come in; put your feet up; sip coffee; read a book.   I would not trade my B&N for half-price bookstores even with the deep discounts.  Half-price bookstores do not have cafes that serve Starbucks coffee, or serve chicken panini.  They do not have overstuffed couches where you can sit with piles of magazines and books by your feet, while you sip your cappucino and leaf through crisp, unwrinkled pages.  They do not have jazz, classic, elevator music playing in the background.    After a very stressful day last night, I visited the B&N downtown.  It is on 4th and Commerce St, encompassing about half the block.  I browsed at leisure.  It's funny what comfort rows of bookshelves filled with books can give you, and book lovers know what I mean.  I bought three books.  I felt both guilt and pleasure purchasing them.  But pleasure outweighed the guilt of spending.  I bought two book, each by a favorite author, and another book to discover a new author.  I cannot wait to travel their pages.    urlLink Everything's Eventual by Stephen King     urlLink Silver Wedding by Maeve Binchy     urlLink Brick Lane by Monica Ali

      It is 11 pm at night. I was supposed to have worked on school work but my computer is crapping out on me.  Ever since I installed the software for my new HP printer it just hasn't worked right.  It's eating up my memory, and now when I check CPU usage its 100%!!!!!!!  I can't do anything!  I created another admin account, but it's just not the same! (yeah, i know, start playing the violins).    I'm trying to find a way to turn this into an opportunity to buy a new computer.  Our monitor is 5 yrs. old and the system is 3 yrs. old.  Its a freaking Micron PC with 433 Mghz  Celeron  processor, and about 198 MB of RAM.  It's just...not cutting it, you guys know what I mean....but guess why we haven't upgraded to a new system?  Even though I get a company discount on Dell systems.  Even though we have had to reload the OS on our system  twice  in the last year.    You got it. My husband.  He doesn't like to spend anything on our credit card, and he doesn't want to touch our savings...and he doesn't want to spend. Period.  Think I can crash this PC guys?  LOL!

      I hate work, i hate work, i hate work. I come across so many computer illiterate people and when I was new, I used to be very patient with them, grateful for my job, grateful for working in a gorgeous downtown setting.  Now, I have no patience at all with these people, especially the ones that call and say they are: network admin, admin, technical coordinators:  Here are some nuggets from my work:  Caller: I am an admin! Me: Okay, then try to create a new folder Caller: I can't. It's saying access is denied.   Me: Exactly, buttwipe!  Me: You need to install it to a network drive: Admin: What's that? Me: I need to talk to someone who is familiar with your network if you're not an admin Admin: I am an admin! Me: Then learn the difference between a local and network drive, you buttwipe!  Tech coordinator: Is this a zero or an 'o'? Me: If it has a slash through it is a zero Tech coordinator: I'm typing it as a zero but when I do, it doesn't have a slash through it on the screen Me: (Laughing my butt off while I have them on mute).  You're a buttwipe   I'm sorry for feeling so cynical today.  All my patience has run out.  I can't wait for the freaking weekend!  And of course, I don't actually call these people buttwipe.  Although I would love to.

      Discovered that awards are being given to the best blog in all sorts of categories at the  urlLink Bloggies .  One of the category is Best Asian Weblog, and one of the contender is  urlLink A Sassy Lawyer in Philippine Suburbia .  I checked out the site.  I'm too stupid for it.  But it's very good. I'm having a great time discovering new blogs.    Recent Accomplishments: -studied  -worked out (yay for me!) -returned items that needed to be returned -bought items needed to be bought  Yesterday was such a nice sleep-in, stretch in bed day.  I woke up around 11:30 am and cooked brunch for husband.  He loved my eggs and bacon.  He sent me a love e-mail during the day which was very sweet.  At the end of it all, I joked that I would love to be a house-wife.  Well, half-joked.  I did like it very much.  Liked it so much it made waking up early today for work much harder. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Something fun for everyone.  Credit to our cousin Shei for teaching us this.  Whenever you get a fortune cookie at Asian/Chinese restaurants, try adding the line "in bed" at the end of it.  Some examples of average fortune cookie turned funny.  To be loved you must be loving... in bed  You will have many adventures... in bed  And if you didn't see Rhy's message on tag board: It's impossible to please everybody...please yourself first.... in bed !

Walk to checkout, pay for things.  Ignore corn nuts. Ignore corn nuts, ignore, ignore!  I said ignore!    Pay for corn nuts with other purchase.  Rationale: it has fiber.  Well, as long as it has fiber.    See skechers shoes on sale.  Buy!  NO! No money.  Remembering now. No money.  Pass shoes.  Electronics store.  Don't go in. Don't go in.  Don't!

       Of printers, pot stickers, and playing games   I got my printer!  I am ecstatic although I went over my budget and had some bumps on the road in purchasing.  The biggest bump was Woody, who did not want to spend the money.  Since it was my refund money I told him he could stay in the car while Rhy and I picked it up.  He was pouting like a big baby, and I kept teasing him for being Mr. Cheapo.  Finally, we got to Fry's.  They did not have the models I was looking for.  But I went with an  urlLink HP PSC 1350 all-in-one printer  that was reasonably priced.   I went over budget because it didn't come with the photo print ink cartridge that was the reason I bought it in the first place, and it didn't come with a USB cable.....(sigh)I was so mad at myself for not reading the box.  But I have it now, and it came with sample photo paper.  I trekked back to the store at 9 pm last night to see if I could return the incompatible glossy photo paper I bought for it (which I've already opened) but they were already closed.  I cussed like a sailor because I was so mad at myself.  Damn me for being so impatient!  I made all the other purchases in a hurry.  But that was Sunday.  Let's rewind:  Saturday Rhy slept over and we tried to shake things up by not going to the same places again.  So we tried a new Asian restaurant called Lava Grill.  It was excellent.  Most excellent was discovering Rhy's acquaintance from work, AJ, worked there and made a free order of pot stickers available.  Woody and I shared chicken pad thai, which was also very good.  It was all capped off by fried banana ice-cream, with 3 different ice cream flavors: green tea, red bean and mango.  We're definitely going back.    Afterwards we went to play!  I wanted to go bowling but the lanes at Main Event were booked up and wait was 1 hr and 45 min long.  So we headed to their arcade area and played some DDR, basketball and air hockey.  Much better for burning off calories. ;-)    We also watched the Medallion.  Ebert gave it two-thumbs up.  Ebert is stupid.  We also watched Ringu, the Japanese movie that inspired the Ring.  The Ring was better.  We had fun watching the second one because  we're trying to learn Japanese.  Rhy brough over his Pimsleur CDs that teaches you Japanese simply by listening.  It's great.   Wakarimas ka? (do you understand)?  The best part about the weekend is that its stll not over...for me anyway.  I have the day off...Mwahahahaha!

       It's Friday!!!!   1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?  So boring: Best, Kristene  2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?  Gosh, this is so lame. I'm lame.  I haven't got one.  And I can't think of any right now.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?  I would love mine to say PrincessTin   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?  I received a keychain in the shape of a teardrop/heart with my husband's name engraved on it. Or rather, his nickname Woody.  It was from my Sis-in-law, H.  What was great about it was that she gave one to Woody with my name engraved on it as well.    5. What would you like your epitaph to be? "She was a good wife, a good mother and a good friend"...is that a proper epitaph?  Hell, I don't know.    That was boring....Let's try the What's in you pantry:  What's in your pantry? SPAM-spam is good, it is not white trash meat...its good for breakfast or lunch, i consider it the other white meat...hehehe Andy Capp's Hot Fries-yum! Its already gone actually. I dumped half the bag last nite because I didn't want to be tempted what with my focus on health and all. Soups-Campbell's Chicken noodle soup in a can, Lipton soup in a bag, Campbell's Vegetable soup, and Wood's current fave, Progresso Lentil soup (its not bad) Pasta Cereal-Honey Bunches of oats and Cinnamon toast crunch Cereal bars-Generic fruit ones and Chewy Granola bar with chocolate chunk Beans-woody likes bean soups Cheetos-Can't be tempted by this, not a cheetos fan Croutons-a box of it, almost gone, for salad Oatmeal-woody's, i ain't crazy about the stuff Instant coffee-woody's Herbal tea-woody's  Which reminds me, I need to do groceries...have a good weekend everyone!

      How funny! I found the website for my old school.  They must have just put this up the past year because this time last year, I had searched but it still wasn't online...Here's my school  urlLink OB Montessori Center    I can still remember our anthem....Actually its kinda foggy now since I last attended when I was 10 yrs. old....but I remember the tune and the last lines:   OB Montessori Center For you and for me!    LOL! By the way, does anyone know Melissa Ann Maquiling?  Anyone?  Melissa, if you can read this, hi! Its me...if you're curious who email me at MrsHekmi@hotmail.com.  We went through the 1st-3rd grade together at the Sta. Ana branch.  If anyone knows her, tell her to give me a shout-out.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Okay I'm feeling nostalgic about schools.  I went through several:  K-3rd grade - OB (which stands for Operation Brotherhood) Montessori 5-6th - Blessed Trinity Catholic School (I skipped 4th grade, no I'm not that smart...it had something to do with the age) in Mississauga, Ontario Canada 7th-8th - St. Agnes Catholic School in Brampton, Ontario Canada 9th-11th - Notre Dame Catholic HS in Brampton 12th - Lakeview Centennial HS in Dallas/FW, TX  quite a move, huh?  If anyone know anyone who went to the above schools (except for Lakeview), shoot me an e-mail.

       The Rythm Never Stops...I Hope   I worked out last nite....already I can feel the fat melting away.  There's muscles now being unearthed by all the twisting and sweating and jumping and running and bending and crunching.....NOT!  I wish losing weight was a progress that matched the speed of gaining it.  But, alas, good things are always harder to achieve, you sometimes have to sweat for them, for pete's sake.    But I am determined.  Now, I can hear my husband and Rhy saying we've heard this before, right before I jab an elbow in their faces anyway ;-), but trust me, this time its different.  This time, I'm looking at a small pouch resting in my belly area, and it ain't a fanny pack. My emergency plan includes cutting on carbs, which means our brand-new Tiger rice cooker has been sitting empty on our kitchen counter for a week.  Carbs is my friend.  It's my favorite thing.  I like it better than sweets.  Once, for Lent, I elected to give up rice and couldn't last--sorry Lord--and defected about 10 days before Lent was over. So you'd think it would be torture for me to give up rice now.  But my desperation is reaching critical level.  I must get fit.  Not just to lose weight but to establish a lifelong habit.    So last night, even though I was dead sleepy from working my 2-10:30 p shift, I cranked up the music and worked out to the music of Patricia Montalero, a Hispanic artist, and her very infectious song, Que El Ritmo No Pare...which, Woody assures me, translates into The Rhythm Never Stops.  I hope my rythm never stops either. -

       Thinking of Husband   I'm bored at work.  K is on vacation so my supervisory asked me if I would work her shift today (2p to 10:30 p). I said yes, I would.  I am thinking about husband.  I'm thinking about divorce rates.  I'm thinking about cheating spouses.  But mostly, I'm thinking about what if something happens to him?  It's so scary how I've only known him for three years, yet this person I have only known for three years has become so IMPORTANT to me.  He is so precious.

      No new developments.  I got my purse and was satisfied.  I brought it to work today.  Did not work out last night. Shame one me.  Instead I had dinner with a friend at Pho 95.  Had a small bowl of beef pho (yum!), bbq pork over rice (one plate shared between me and T) and some drip pot iced coffee (some argue its better than starbucks...don't know about that).  We then watched some DVDs.  Rhy, we watched season 3.  I forgot how good it is.  Went home, talked all night with husband and slept at about 2 am.  I'm trying to play around with my layout but have not been very successful to get the look I want.  I would pay for someone to change my layout so it looks unique. There's a job for somebody.  I've added some pics to test out.  I'll add more later.  See how 'photos' is so small?  I don't get how to make it the same size as the other ones.  I give up...I really don't know html.

      Screwed up big-time.  Husband is pissed.  He dropped his medical and dental elections at work for 2004 because we decided that it would be advantageaous (sp?) if I just add him to mine.  We hadn't married yet when the deadline to choose our benefits came up.  I checked with our office HR and she said that I can add my spouse "anytime" because its a change in status.  So I was happy.  Well, office HR was out sick for a week and we didn't receive our marriage license till the beginning of January.  When I went up to her yesterday she told me I only had 30 days after the change of status to change my election and add my spouse....I looked at her with horror--our wedding was on Nov. 22nd of last year!.....Why hadn't she mentioned this before?....then she starts telling me how when she had her baby she didn't know about the 30 day rule and so they wouldn't let her add her son to her benefits....why didn't she tell me this before!?!?!?!?!   Nakakainis ...It's not her fault.  It just goes to show you you have to rely on yourself...I should have called the HR office in Orlando and asked them all these questions or read our benefits guidebook.  Husband is pissed!  On a lighter note I got my Coach purse today.  Still haven't picked it up from the apartment office.  Husband said he will do it.  Husband still loves me despite my gaffe. Yay!  Was very productive last nite...Went to school after work and did some more labs...They're getting a bit difficult especially the ones in quiz forms. I then went home vegetated in front of the TV and watched  Finding Nemo  on DVD.  After that, I.....worked out!  Will notthink too highly of myself for working out this one time because I may fall off the wagon again so to speak, and neglect being physically active.  I also got my referral check from school.  They have a referral program where they give you money for referring people to go the school.  I referred my husband =).  I can do the following with the money:  a)Pay off credit card used for new tires b)Buy a new printer/scanner/copier (all in one) c)Save it  I'm leaning towards b.

      Poor husband was teased by coworkers by my underwear post on him.  To set the record straight, husband changes underwear daily now.  In fact, he sometimes feels the need to change twice, even three times a day.  If he had the money to keep doing so, he would change underwear hourly.  Really....=)  Recap of my weekend  Friday night: Watched  Underworld  at Tony's house.  His housemates, B and G had gotten a new big-screen HDTV.  Cool.  They also cooked.  Pretty good: grilled chicken, mac n cheese, rice in cream of mushroom sauce and  frites  (french fries).  Saturday: Slept in! Went to school to finish labs.  Freaked out over hubby's purchase of new tires (badly needed).  Went to dinner at OG.  Read  Phantoms  by Dean Koontz.  Finished it at 3 am!  Sunday:  Family (Mom, Dad, Rhy and little Jedd) visited us in our new apartment for the 1st time.  We cooked for them, they brought dessert and some Boston Market chicken.  Good lunch!  Husband is such a good cook.  They brought over a belated gift for husband's b-day.  Thanks parents!  We then went to mall and goofed off there.  I got an early b-day present from my mom (wooden jewelry box from Bombay) and she also bought me some Express shirts. Thanks mom!  We then ate at East Buffet.  Yummy fried chicken dumplings there.  Went home.  Such homebodies.  Thinking of going indoor rock climbing next weekend to shake things up.  END Summary

      This blog is specially dedicated to my Tito Noli living in England:  My Tito Noli lives in Salisbury, England with my Tita Lora and two cousins, Meg and Malone.  He's posed the question as to why they should live in the US.  There are many.  First, the taxes will not be as high.  Canada and England both have socialist governments and these two countries do take the burden of college and medical bills.  However, that means collecting almost half of your paychecks.  What about doctor's bills and college in the US you ask?  Well, with your profession, you'll command the same high salary, and good benefits including medical and dental benefits.  You can elect to have your employer take a portion of your paycheck every payday and pay it toward your own dental and medical insurance which can include your whole family.  But it will not be half of your paycheck.  You'll be taking much more of your paycheck home for your own discretionary use.    For college, the government has these amazing things called government student loans and grant.  If you're poor enough, you get grants, which you never have to pay back.  If not, your children are qualified to get a low-interest loan which they start paying back 6 months after they graduate.  They are given 10, 15 and even more years to pay it back.  For example, I pay $160/month for my student loans and it'll be paid off in 10 years.  Now, my income may go up in those 10 yrs., but my payment never will.  To me, the these are great reasons to work in the US.  Also, its the US!  We have baseballe games, MTV (the original MTV, the real MTV), diversity.  If you live in Texas, especially Dallas/FW area, the housing is really cheap.  You can get credit cards, you can get 0% financing on your car with zero money down.  You have huge shopping malls, fast food and convenience stores in every corner, you have high-speed internet, and many more.  Plus, Meg and Malone will be so cute with their accents here!...trust me, Americans love the british accent.    The best reason to move into the US?  We're here!  Hehehe.  You'll get to see both Mama here family and Tito Darwin and his family.  No matter whether you live in our state or Tito Darwin's, we'll see more of each other...  Did I convince you enough?  Move here already!  But maybe wait until we get to visit you!  Love,  Me -

       Odd Facts About Husband   Is it men or is it just my husband?  Here, some puzzling facts involving my husband, Woody:  1. I came home tonite after having done the groceries and was putting away food in the fridge when I saw our clear plastic jug filled with white stuff.  I'm thinking, curdled milk, coconut milk, what is that white stuff?    It was leftover rice.  He stored our leftover rice in a clear plastic jug.  I wrote on our eraser board:  please don't put our rice in clear plastic jug again, because...well, its just weird!   2. Husband, as mentioned above, is a great sneezer.  And not just when I've gotten him sick.  Once, back when we were in college, he regaled me with tales of his allergy attack in class.  He started sneezing and the whole class counted each sneeze...he sneezed once, twice, three times....by this time the whole class was amused....four times, five, six....the class started getting excited --will it break a record?---seven, eight, nine....the class started counting out loud as a group....ten, evelen....sixteen sneezes!    The class went wild, they hailed him a hero, a god! They carried him on their shoulders, out the classroom door, out the school building singing "for he's a jolly good fellow".    Okay, maybe the last part never happened.  3. Husband will insist we do not clean up after ourselves when we eat in fast food restaurants.  He believes if we clean up after ourselves it will steal jobs away from the low-paid workers who work in such restaurants.  We have to do what we can to make them indispensable, he insists.  This fact obliges me to make sure I carry all our after-eating trash to the trash bin myself.  4.  Husband always insists we are broke.  Even when we have money.  When I try to tell him how much money we actually have he'll stop me.  He wants to always think we're broke.  He doesn't want to feel like he can spend whatever we want because we have money in the bank....okay maybe this is actually a good idea.  5. Husband wears underwear for multiple days until I threaten to take a match to said underwear, then he changes it.    Odd husband, loving husband, lovable husband. =) -

      Husband is now sick as well.  He woke up at 5 in the morning to take medicine because of a runny nose.  Then proceeded to sneeze when he got back to bed.  Now my husband is a great sneezer.  He must have sneezed 30 freaking times last night.  I ignored him, or tried to.  But 30 sneezes is hard to ignore.    When i came in to work this morning, B starts going on about calling in sick together again.  I give him a look and he follows it with admission he probably won't do it.  Whatever.  I've only got today and tomorrow to tackle until the weekend.    Very happy with myself.  Am now ready to do my first two labs for school having finished the first set of objectives last night.  Felt very productive.    Disappointed my friend Tony again for forgetting a DVD he's been bugging me to bring.  Sorry, Tony!  Will/must remember to bring it for our dinner tomorrow night.  Must dust, vaccuum (sp?), and do the laundry before next week.  Hope my laziness won't kick in again and leave them all undone.    Oh and internet connection is now up at home!    -

      Another set of 6 people are out sick today.  Why did I decide to be work-ethic girl and come in?  Why?  I am continously having to put people on mute why I sneeze and blow my nose or cough.  And they're like "hey are you there?"  while I'm having to pause my nose-blowing, take them off mute, and say "yes, Ib he, blease holb" (nose congested getting in the way of normal professional tone).  Yesterday my coworker B turned to me in a conspiratorial way.  b: let's call in sick tomorrow me: yeah, okay.  Its a pact!  A few hours later he comes up to me again  b: well, what would we do if we call in sick? me: stay home and get some rest! b: its no use staying home.  if we're calling in sick it should be for something that's worth it.  lets go to work. me: you little %#%$%$%$%$!  Okay, so pact broken and I'm at work today.  I would list a funny anecdote but I'm not feeling it.  Let me try again......nope, can' feel it.  Oh, but hi to my tito dandy!  Hi tito, you're dabomb.  He always keeps in touch and sends my mom pirated DVDs and crap like that.  He's cool.

      Still have the cold...Work yesterday was hell due to being sick and the high call volume. So tempted to call in sick today but am determined not to start of the new year with calling in sick at work.  Six people are out today due to sickness though.  Maybe I'll take my sick day tomorrow :b  Hubby's b-day today!  I went to Target last night after work to use a gift card in purchasing Vicks cough and cold syrup, a TV antennae (yes, we still have rabbit ears, no cable at our place), and a card and DVD for my husband.  I was coughing and had a runny nose and could feel everyone looking at me thinking,   what are you doing out here infecting everyone?  To them i say: "Aaaaccchoooo!"   There.  Hey, I have to get my hubby a card, k?  This is heroic stuff.  I drive home, I was so out of it with my nose all stuffed up and me wondering could I manage to drive with one hand, while twisting the bottle cap off my medicine and drinking that stuff like there was no tomorrow with the other hand?  I managed to wait until I got home.  I looked at my keyring and could not find my house key.    Flashback to 2 days before:  Rhy: here's your key back Me: thanks, just put it on the kitchen counter  Me two days later in front of my apartment door:  Dope!  I get in my car again, drive to woody's work, managing to come into oncoming traffic lane and escaping with my car intact (no car in sight) whew!.  I go to wood's break room door and knocked.  Some 'puti' loser gives me the look and opens the door a crack as if I could push past his 'taba' frame.  "Can I help you?"  Yeah, you can help me by getting some breath mints and getting out my way!  Instead I take a deep breath and explain to him my predicament.  I needed my husband's house key as I had locked mine in the house.  He continues studying me as if I'm some Filipino muslim girl that Osama bin laden's recruited to pose as a seemingly innocent house wife with a cold and runny nose ready packed with explosives.   I was ready to go for his shin -- or balls-- when he let me past him.  I go through the doors to the office area and say hi to Sylvia, and Kim,   "do you know this girl?" he asks them  Idiot!  Why would they be hugging me in all my coughing glory if they didn't know me?  Found hubby, gave him a kiss, got his keys, and took his money.  I hadn't eaten yet and it was 8:30 p by this time.  I said adios, drove to Wendy's, got me some 99 cent menu items and drove home.  Ah, sweet home.  Let me eat, drink my sleep-inducing medicine and go to bed.    End Credits  Epilogue:  Husband loved the DVD and the mushy stuff I wrote on the card.  I love husband.

      Promised to post everyday but my DSL is not up yet at my new apartment.  They're saying it'll take about 5 days to switch over. Well we're officially settled into the new apartment.  We cleaned up the old one and hopefully they don't charge us too much for my sloppy bathroom cleaning...scrubbing toilets and bathtubs are the worst.  Rhy, my bro, has left for home (tears) and it is just Woody and I now.  We had a DVD marathon over the weekend.  I got the cold and didn't feel like going out.  The only time I went out was Friday night when Rhy treated me to dinner and I treated him to a movie.  Ate at Joe's Crabshack and watched our servers do the Macarena as the night's entertainment(uh-huh)....  Start of the year and we've already spent money. Woody bought a sweater on sale at Old Navy I bought socks and sweater and a new pair of jeans at American Eagle.  Woody, my cheapskate husband, gave me a $35 budget for my jeans.  Husband, I love you but you know you're cheap...people at work call him Mr. Cheap-o, a reputation which, oddly enough, he is proud of. Good thing AE had a sale going on.   New year's resolution: Obtain my network+ certification Start with my workout regimen and maintain it  Eat healthier Hopefully fit into my size 6 jeans again Save up for Las Vegas Be less LAZY!

      I meant to update my posts everyday but yesterday the sites were acting bad..bad blogger, bad blogger....  So now I'm back. Its 2004! Happy New Year everybody.  We spent New Year's Eve at my aunt's house. Good food, good champagne, good margaritas.  Slept over at my mom's and chatted with her a little in the morning.  She worked last night.  At midnight I started calling all people to greet them New Year.  Friends included Tony, and sis-in-law H.  H was working too.  Sad.  We were supposed to go party hopping. I wanted to visit S's party but she lived about 1 1/2 hr away from my aunt's house.  Also wanted to visit Tony's little get-together at his house.  Ended up watching a marathon of Friends season 1 on DVD and Finding Nemo.  It ended up being an okay nite, especially with husband, dad and bros with me. Once again, Happy New Year everybody.  Challenge up ahead: Cleaning the old apartment  Topics coming soon: New Year's resolution.

       And the winners are....   My mom and dad won their Filipino American Society's Mr. and Ms. Valentine competition thingy.  Sounds a little silly but it's for a good cause.  Anyway, I'll let the  urlLink pictures  talk for this blog.    And speaking of winners.  Loved Charlize Theron's speech last night.  Congratulations to her and her Oscar-worthy performance in  Monsters .  And to  Lord of the Rings, Return of the King , congratulations for an 11-award clean sweep.

       Butt Cheeks   I went to my first cycle class on Saturday. Hauled myself out of bed early in the morning (10:30 hehe) and walked in.  I thought I would have to leave because I just couldn't get the hang of how to adjust the bike for my short frame.  I sat either too high, or the handle bars were too far away.  Too complex for my simple mind.  Anyway, this girl next to me took pity and helped me adjust my bike. I sat front row and center. I am a good student--actually I just forgot to wear my contacts.  Pam was our instructor.  She had tight everything.  Tight butt, tight muscles, toned everywhere.  She's about 30 years my senior.  How impressive.  The girl who helped me adjust my bike turned to me before it all started and noticed I didn't have a bottle of water.    "It's about an hour long, you're gonna need a bottle."  Me: "I didn't know that.  It's my first time."  Helpful girl: "Oh. Well, if you get tired you can always leave."   I lasted the whole hour .  And by the end of it, I was praying Pam would stop.  She definitely took me past the leisurely bike ride I'm used to.  Now my butt cheeks hurt.  Ouch.  My quads as well....I'm coming back for more torture/fun next Saturday.

       No Friday Five?   So I'm using an old one:  1. What did you have for breakfast this morning? If you didn't have breakfast, why not?  I had Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal with 1% milk.  Husband can't stand skim milk or else it'll be skim.  2. What's your favorite cereal?  Used to be cinnamon toast cereal but I'm getting tired of it.  I also like Frosted Mini Wheats.  3. How often do you eat out? Do you want that to change?  We used to eat out every weekend.  Boy was that yummy.  For the past 1/2 year or so, its been more like 2x a month, with at least one additional visit to East Buffet.  Yes, we're changing.  Tyring to cut down no zero eating out a month to expensive places. Maybe just 1-2 visits to East Buffet. Husband loves that place.  4. What do you plan on having for dinner tonight? Got a recipe for that?  We were gonna get Pho (T and I) at our favorite Vietnamese place.  But he just told me right now he's not feeling too well.  He said he feels like he's getting strep throat. Oh brother.  I'll probably eat leftover teriyaki chicken. Recipe: Chicken, cut in thin slices, garlic, onions and kikkoman's teriyaki sauce.  Or get some fast food. (Yay, just got our tax refund!)  5. What's your favorite restaurant? Why?  My favorite is Carraba's Italian Grill.  We always get good to great servers, great food, great atmosphere. Used to be Olive Garden but I've had too many bad servers at their different restaurants and this turned me off.   Umm...that's it for this week.  And again, Yay to tax refund and some $$ in my pocket!  I'm gonna sign up for  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness .

      There's this cake in the office fridge.  It's called Tres Leches Cake or Three Milk Cake.  Its from Super Target.  Or maybe Mexico.  Yesterday, when S rolled it around the office and offered each of us a slice, I declined.  I puffed up my chest with pride. I declined cake!  I am a good person.  But this cake. This Tres Leches Cake.  It is  malo  or bad.  It purrs at me whenever I grab something healthy from the fridge.  My apple.  My bag of mini carrots.  My chicken teriyaki.  It purrs:  "Me taste so bueno.  So bueno.  Eat me, por favor. I only want you to eat me."   It morphs too.  The original icing on it said, "Good luck on your Wedding Day, C!". But the icing has been smashed, cut here and there by those who gave into temptation.  It now has the first initial of my name.  It is  malo !  I shut the fridge quickly, but I know its still behind there.  Lurking.  Waiting to entice me.

       Confessions of a Carb Addict   No rice for 40 days.  That was my conviction; that's what I would give up for Lent.  Ash Wednesday was only yesterday and I have broken the vow twice already.  I am such a carb addict; more specifically, a rice addict.  There is just something wrong with the way some of the food I eat taste if it is not eaten with rice.  Spam, fried chicken, chicken teriyaki.  I like them with rice! For lunch today, I was determined to renew my promise.  I  baon ed chicken teriyaki with potatoes, bell peppers, squash and corn (still carbs).  I also munched on some fries today.  Arrgghh!  Is there a Carb-Aholic Anonymous I can enroll in?

       Brrrr!   -After a mild weekend, we are back to being drenched in rain...Its cold out there, and dreary, and wet, and gray, and just plain depressing.  Weather bug, you promised me a mild weather, you putz.   -I started a food diary...only a 1 day entry and it is glaringly obvious that I have some changes to make.  I went to school last night even though it was pouring, and then went to work out afterward. Hubby is so proud of me.    -I love that it's hump day. I am itching to get my hands on some Beyonce, Missy Elliott and Tamia tickets.  Concert's at American Airlines Center on March 15 and Rhy is treating me.   -I also checked our bank account and still no refund. What's up with that? I think I'm just being impatient.  They did say 10 days, and that doesn't come until Friday/next Monday, depending on what day my accountant starts/ends counting.

       Curves   I had my body fat composition measured today.....no comment I had my weight taken....not that bad I had my fitness assessed....could be better  The fact is I need to get off my butt, stop giving lip service to being fit and actually  move my butt .  I need to stop being a slave to rice. I need to stop being slave to carbs period.  I feel motivated, I really do, and hoping that the monthly fee I shell out to  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness  will motivate me even further, as well as the svelte bodies that abound in the location I'm going to enroll in.  Hubby has given me the thumbs-up...I'm all set to sign up.  However, he didn't give me a thumbs-up for their personal training sessions (18-week sessions, 2 times a  week for $900).  Ummm, maybe when my paycheck balloons a little bit.  My goals: Lose 10 lbs. and get down to 24% body fat.

       Back to Reality   Reach into my pockets and you'll find lint...hehehe...I treated my whole family to an advanced b-day celebration for my Mom.  We went to Olive Garden.  Good old OG.  The food was great but our server was so bad! I hate bad service.  Anyway, we just tried to ignore her; we didn't want to ruin a good experience. We had calamari for appetizers, and Woody and I split an order of chicken marsala.  We had tiramisu and berry crostada for dessert as well as a couple of glasses of wine.   Oh at the end, woody wrote the server a note that he thought would "help" her, along the lines of find another job.  I bet she spat in our food.    On another note, I think I'm gonna have to give up my wish list as I visited 24 HR Fitness Super Sport center over the weekend and I want to join badly.  It'll cost me about $200 to do so if I go with the cheapest plan. I used to be a member of another 24 HR gym but it was nothing like this.  Goody bye wishlist!  (Edited to add: Except for my trips of course...that's still a go!)  Hope everyone is less broke than I am.

       Friday Five   When was the last time you...   1. ...went to the doctor?  Just last Wednesday, for my knees.    2. ...went to the dentist?  October...I remember I wanted to go to the dentist before my wedding!   3. ...filled your gas tank?  Last Monday, before going to work.   4. ...got enough sleep?  Last Saturday. I slept in until 12:00 pm, woke up for an hour, went back to sleep until 3:30 pm...the shame!   5. ...backed up your computer?   We just reinstalled the OS on our PC about six months ago.  And even if we wanted to backup our files we have no CD-R drive on it, not even a zip drive.  Maybe a tape backup? On floppy disks?  I hate our PC...someone buy me a new one already!

       Dead Lilies Smelling   Okay, the flowers aren't dead yet but I am tempted to throw them out now. It's inevitable that they will wilt and die so I'm trying to figure whether to put them out of their misery now and send them to trash purgatory or let them stand tall for a little while longer.  Hmmmm....I think I'll wait another day.  Despite their slow wilt, they still smell wonderful.  My title was very misleading...don't shoot me.

       An Apple a Day...   An apple a day is supposed to keep the doctor away but in my case, it didn't help.  Yup, my knees have been acting up for a while again and I met up with my doctor today. He is a little quirky.  Anyway, I get evaluated for my physical therapy next Tuesday.  I hope everything works out and my knees get better with no chance of needing surgery.  That's it for me. I'm feeling a little deflated...damn knees!

       Calla Lilies   Calla lilies were the flowers that my husband and I had as part of our flower arrangements.  It was in my bouquet and in his lapel.  He got me callal lilies for my b-day, delivered to my office.  Well, it bloomed over the weekend and now the blooms are open and emitting heavenly scents that have made everyone in the place come by to take a sniff.    I took pictures so my husband can see them.  Maybe I'll post them later.  I think I'll go around and take pics of downtown too now that I have my digital camera with me.

       Till Next Weekend   Enjoyed my weekend so much.  Am so envious of people that look forward to getting up and going to work on Monday.  Anyway, it was very eventful.  First of all, we got snow in Texas!  This is the first snowfall of the winter season and having hubby wake me up and pull up the blinds to reveal drops of snow and a white covered scene outside the window was a good way to wake up on Valentine's day.  Unlike those that live in colder parts of the world, snow is still a novelty for us.  We thought we wouldn't be able to go anywhere because the roads would ice up but the weather cooperated and we were able to trek to Carraba's Italian Grill and beat the crowd.  No waiting, unlike the  poor folks who came in about an hour after we came in.  I didn't order the right thing--too much pasta.  But I had a peach Bellini and the atmosphere was romantic as hell.  I looked at the couples around us and I imagined we were the happiest couple there...corny, I know.  After that, we went to the mall.  I have been feeling selfish lately because it always seems to be about me.  My shoes that we buy, my purse, my flowers so I tried to get Woody to buy a pair of brown boots that he's been wanting.  But he took a look at the prices and just couldn't bring himself to be impractical for once (sigh).  I bought myself a pair of dark blue jeans from the Gap (used $$ gift that I got).  I love it.  The style is called Long and Lean.  Before purchasing, they told us they had a deal of buy $75 and get $15 off.  So hubby picked out a sweater and a pair of pants as well.    And Sunday was good too.  I got my eyebrows done (finally!). We met up with my family at Galleria mall.  Visited a lot of stores.  I bought a belt from Gap and hope I've heard the last of hubby saying I need a belt (he thinks wide belts are sexy...go figure).  We had dinner at Tokyo One.  I had Teppanyaki, crab legs with butter and lime, chicken teriyaki, shrimp fried rice, creme brulee for dessert....the best part: towards the end of the meal after coming back from the bathroom, our server brought out a cake with a candle and a chocolate-dipped strawberry on top and my whole family sang me Happy B-Day.  I have the best family.  And I have the best brother:  Rhy, thanks for the paper-shredder! It's weird but I have always wanted this.  I now feel safer about my private information when I put it in the trash.

       I'ts My Party...   What a wonderful day!  I love getting birthday greetings from people I love and from strangers as well.  Today, my phone rang off the hook from friends and family wishing me a happy birthday, I got b-day wishes from strangers and from family members on my blog and greeting cards in the mail.  I love birthdays.  It's strange, people always asks me if I'm worried when my b-day falls on Friday the 13th but I have never looked at it that way.  To me its always been the day before Valentine's Day.    Oh, and probably the best part about my day is that my hubby sent me flowers at work.  My husband who doesn't believe in sending flowers, thinks its just for showing off, thinks that if you buy flowers it should be randomly and whenever you feel like it and shouldn't be from an expensive place....Well, he sent me flowers...and they were beautiful and smelled good, and I appreciated them.  I love you husband!  What a day...soon senility will set in...;)

       Hungry Man   I mistakenly bought one of those Hungry Man TV dinners.  I was packing my lunch this morning and checked the calorie count of my TV dinner.  790 calories...I was taken aback.  A closer look at the package revealed it was a Hungry Man tv dinner with  "1 lb. of food!" .  Sheesh, what did I get myself into.  And I didn't have enough time to prepare anything else.  For lunch, I heated up my 1-lb. tv dinner, carefully scooped out the mashed potatos, the apple cranberry dessert and felt better.  It has 3 pcs. of chicken.  I have one left and I ain't touching that thing.  But I will grab a couple of these fries my friends' offering me....

       Confessions of a Midnight Snacker   Hagen Dazs' Rocky Road with Marshmallow Swirl somehow tastes much better at night when we are not supposed to be eating cause it's almost time for bed.  I went to school last night and joy of all joy, finally finished everything and got to take my first mastery exam.  I mastered it with only 3 questions wrong.  I got home at about 10:30 and hadn't eaten.  I waited for husband and we ate chicken  noodle soup and sandwich.  Then we turned to each other afterwards and knew we were both thinking the same thing: Ice Cream!  One pint, two spoons, eating out of the package. Yum!

       100 Things   I wanted to make a link to my 100 things but I don't know how to create a page within a page...did I say that right?  Anybody care to tutor me on that?  Until I learn, here's my 100 things, right in the middle of it all:  1. I am impatient 2. I am grateful that my husband is not 3. Impatience is my #1 vice 3. I drive fast 4. I pass and cut off people on the road if they are driving too slow 5. Don't hold this against me, I said I was impatient! 6. I hate people who drive slow on the fast lanes (if you frequent my blog, then I don't mean you) 7. I love to travel 8. I promised myself that before I turned 30 I will visit Paris 9. Now I'm not so sure because I heard that Parisians are rude 10. I don't like rude people 11. I'm a pacifist 12. I like to get along with everyone 13. But I am not fake 14. If I don't like you, I just will not talk to you 15. But I will still be polite 16. I don't like to buy on credit 17. I save voraciously 18. But I still like to spend 19. I wish I had the means to spend voraciously as well 20. I am a real-estate enthusiast 21. I believe in investing 22. I don't have the money to invest yet 23. I am not very religious but I do believe in God 24. I love surprises 25. I love kids 26. I want to name my daughter Yasmine Camille and my son Aidan Adile 27. If you steal these names, you will be cursed 28. I have a loud laugh 29. I have a loud sneeze 30. I can be moody 31. I have hang-ups about weight 32. Intellectually I think it's stupid to have hang-ups about my weight 33. But emotionally, I'm just a girl subject to the media's influence 34. That's why I rarely watch TV 35. Of the shows I like to watch, Friends, CSI and Frasier are my favorites 37. My favorite TV show of all time is a most secret thing 38. I will tell you anyway: it's Buffy the Vampire Slayer 39. I have all 5 seasons on DVD (there's 7 total but only the 1st 5 are out) 40. I am a Buffy fanatic 41. When I watch my DVDs of Buffy, I actually talk to the characters as if what I say will alter their behavior. 42. When my husband watches with me, he laughs 43. He says it is more entertaining to watch me watch Buffy, than to watch Buffy. 44. I had the Buffy  Once More With Feeling  soundtrack but I lost it 45. That made me sad 46. I am a Windows OS girl 47. But would like to learn Mac 48. I want to learn HTML 49. I want to learn Japanese 50. I want to learn Spanish 51. My husband speaks Spanish, French, German, Arabic, English 52. I am extremely proud of my husband 53. I am extremely protective of my husband 55. I am left-handed 56. I like SPAM 57. I like food in general 58. I dislike working out 59. Although after working out, I get that runner's high feeling that workout enthusiasts get 60. I am a little vain 61. Not a lot, because I think it's unattractive to be vain 62. Oddly, I am not that "girlie" 63. I rarely wear make-up 64. I rarely wear skirts or dresses 65. I dress more for comfort than style  66.  Right now, I badly need my eyebrows done  I finally got my eyebrows done 67. I like pedicures, especially French ones 68. I am a bit of a loner 69. I am very much a homebody 70. But I love people 71. I can sit in a park, mall, church, and just watch people 72. I like to think I am not judgemental 73. I love people from other cultures 74. I once sat at an Indian restaurant not too long ago with the following people dining with me: an American, a Chinese, an Indian, a Japanese, a Russian, and a Moroccan, and of course me, the Filipino in the group 75. I love other cultures 76. I once went to party that had the following people: a Mexican, a Venezuelan, a Peruvian, a Brazilian, an Ecuadorian, an African (don't know what country), a Moroccan, bunches of Americans, and me the Filipino in the group 77. I don't think I've mentioned it, but my husband is a Moroccan 78. He is also Muslim 79. Though not a practicing one per se 80. I used to have writing aspirations 81. I get horrified by people's bad grammar 82. I get horrified by my own grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes 83. I was born in the Philippines 84. I'm fluent in Tagalog 85. I moved to Canada when I was 10 86. I moved around in Canada about 3 times within a span of 6 years. 87. I moved to Texas, USA when I was 17 88. So now I hate moving 89. I am extremely close to my brother, Rhy 90. I am also close to my family 91. I have another brother, Jedd 92. He is growing up too fast 93. I am afraid to raise a daughter in the US 94. I think men have it easier than women 95. But I would choose to be a woman any day 96. I think we're prettier, cleaner, sexier, softer, and just make the world a better place 97. Imagine if world just had men (shudder) 99. But if the world just had women, I think we'll be just fine 100. But I think if my husband wasn't in the world, well, I frankly don't want to be in it.  Bow.

       Home Sweet Home    My friend T is buying a house.  Congrats, T!  He heard about this great deal that  urlLink KB Homes  is having in our area.  They have great incentives right now, I swear.  They'll take $15,000 off the price of the home, pay your closing costs, and pay 3% of the down payment.  They'll also give you a $500 upgrade voucher if you meet some requirements.   Grabe  ang good deal!  I went with him to visit the model homes.  I love model homes so much.  Of course KB Homes is nothing like  urlLink Grand Homes  or  urlLink David Weekly , but still, I love the way they decorate in there.  Can someone decorate my place like that?  T will be choosing visiting the KB Homes Studio on Fri. and he wanted me to come.  Too bad I have to work.    So if anyone is thinking about selling a home, and you have a KB Home builder near you, get thee there fast.

      Having trouble uploading my pic at rice bowl journals...hmmmm...don't know what I'm doing wrong.    Yesterday I asked my coworker B about his opinion regarding the fact that I was not able to get my car to start last Saturday but that a mechanic had checked my battery and did a diagnostic check on my car and said it was okay.  B is a car mechanic enthusiast and I was made to sit through explanations of spark plugs and what part they played in getting my car started, and how it sparks the oil, which turns the pistons, blah blah blah.  I sat clueless, but managed to retain the fact that I shouldn't have to worry about my car not starting unless it happens again, that it was probably vapors.  Thank, B.  On our walk to our cars after worked, he asked me how my day was, and from there I told him I was unsatisfied at work, I wasn't learning anything new, I was unchallenged, etc., etc.  He told me that there may be a position opening up in our testing lab, away from the phones and if I "shone" maybe I'd get it.  Thanks, B, but I know for a fact that M and T have been vying for that kind of position and they've been there longer than me.  B is pretty influential but M is his closest friend at work.  I want to get off the phones! But like I told B, I need to earn my stripes.  He did it for 3 yrs. before coming to his current position.

      As promised, my weekend was totally devoid of productivity except for seeing my tax guy.  After seeing him, we drove out of our way to satisfy our cravings for the best fajitas we've ever tasted.  Brother's Garcia is a family-owned restaurant that we use to frequent when we lived around the area.  We were sad that the old owners were gone as they used to greet us with a familiar smile whenever we would come.  But after asking our server he informed us that the business was still in the family and that the old owner had sold it to his brother, the guy who had seated us.  The rest of our Saturday was spent indoors, vegetatin in front of the television.  Then on Sunday, we woke up rather early to meet with my parents and brothers at church.  After that we went to Benihana Grill and Restaurant.  Our chef, Zu Hap, was great.  He flipped eggs and bowls of rice while he cooked our food right in front of us, although he couldn't actually perfect that rice bowl flip trick.  We then sauntered to the closest mall and laughed our heads off as we browsed at Neiman Marcus.  My mom, who is not averse to buying pricey things, almost had a heart attack at the $1000 Prada bags we came across.  We visited Bebe, and my Mom gave bought a Bebe shirt for my b-day gift.  I bought my parents this cake they've been wanting from Corner Bakery, then went to parent's house and watched ASAP. Some obeservations:   Vilma Santo's son Luis aka Lucky is not that cute   Kristine Hermosa's outfit was  baduy    I didn't recognize as many people as I thought I would   I know that Mahal and the other small person is supposed to be funny, but they actually make me sad   Woody enjoyed the Viva Hotbabes, hehe   The show made me want to have tight abs   :p   -

       TGIF   It is the end of the week again.  I always get excited when this day comes around.  This weekend, I promise to sleep in and laze around doing nothing productive at all.  The only productive thing I will deign to do is go see my tax guy.    This week's Friday Five:   1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done?   I've gone skinny-dipping ;b   2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?   My mother would never approve of me moving to another state (Hawaii--i would love it)   3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)   I think my risk factor's pretty low right now.  I'd say a 4.  I hope to change that though.   4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?   Errr...because I hardly take risks, I am not qualified to answer this question.   5. ... and what's the worst?   Okay, I have done one thing in my life that I'm not proud of but could be chalked up to boldness, riskiness.  I won't say what I did, but I had to pay $900 for it.   And with that, I bid you all adieu.    ***  Check out party pics again.  It seemed my changes did not save to make it public.  Rhy, MIchael and Samantha, the little boy and girl in the middle is the the cuties I'd mentioned before.  Mom's mexican and dad's american.

      I didn't make it to school last night.  It was pouring outside and by the time I walked to my car, with an umbrella o'er my head, my jeans were soaked from the knees down.  I was wet, cranky, and couldn't bring myself to make the extra drive to school.  I wanted to go home and change into dry clothes! So I did.    A pile of three-day old dishes waited for me at the sink.  My note of  Please wash the dishes , had been overwritten with,  I didn't have time to do them, I promise I'll do them later .    I admit I wen't a little psychotic.  I screamed with frustration unrelated to the dishes and called my husband at work.  I got his vm. I left him a psychotic message about never doing the dishes.  I may have shrieked at the end.  Needless to say, he never called me that night and stayed late working overtime, to avoid his hag wife.  I have since apologized.  Husband, I haven't gone crazy like that in a long time, right?  Most of the time I am sane and loving, right?   ***  What's my problem? Do I not care about work anymore?  I came in late today.  Supposed to have come in an hour early for training. Came in my regular time.  I was so embarrassed.  I told my sup that I was embarrassed and he said so was he...ouch!  I don't think he's impressed.

      I went to school last night because I really, really needed help with my labs.  I was working on some network designs and just got so confused.  I know what a hub and bridge does in theory, so why couldn't I have figured it out myself?  I don't know.  Wasn't confident enough probably because when my mentor showed my the answer, it was sooooooo easy.  He gave me the answer key to all the labs. Hehe...My mentor is awesome.  Very knowledgeable, approachable, taught me a lot of tricks on how to retain what I'm studying.  He loves questions.  Oh, and what message did I see on the sign-in screen when I got to school but:  "congratulations on your wedding.  please pick up your gift in bob's office.  it's in a yellow bag"  The bag was lovely, but the thought was even lovelier.  Bob is the guy who signed up husband and me for our classes.  He wasn't there for me to thank him.  I need to drop off a thank you note.  Truth be told I am way behind on my labs.  I'm supposed to have finished all of them in one week. But its self-paced so I'm not sweating it.  Although my hubby is ahead of me so maybe I should step up my efforts. Competitive much?  Aside from that I am still smoothing our finances.  Calculating, making everything balance.  I don't enjoy math but I do enjoy accounting--just not in a classroom setting, thank you very much.  ***  I got a cheesy-looking certificate for getting perfect attendance for last month.  Being rewarded with an extra 1/2 day off.  People are giving me and the other two people that got the certificate a mixture of amusing smiles and dirty looks.  Mostly making fun of the cheesy certificates.  I think its cool. Extra 1/2 day off, yay!

      I've made an appointment to see the tax guy my parents use.  I spoke with him on the phone and was puzzled by his accent.  He did not sound Filipino.  It turns out he's Indian.  I though all this time my parent's tax guy was Filipino. Oh well, tax refund, here I come!  That's it for now. Got nothing going on.

       Back to the Daily Grind   It's Monday again, many people's least favorite day.  What else can I say about that?    I'm feeling very productive recently.  I cleaned house, got my oil/oil filter and air filter changed, and did the groceries with hubby, as well as worked out.  Yay for me!  I just need to catch up on my school work and I'll be up to speed on everything.    I also did my year-end financial report and have come up with some embarrassing facts about our spending habits and some goals to remedy it, neither of which I will elaborate on.  There's one other major thing hovering on my mind: how to fit our finances to make do with 3 trips coming up within the year and early next.  The plan was to go to Las Vegas on November, and to Philippines early March 2005.  The third trip was the trip we forgot, to California for my Lola's 75th b-day in July.  Woody and I are planning to tighten the belt considerably to double up on our savings.  I celebrated this plan by buying a pair of heeled sandals from Aldo =).  God please, give me the strength to say 'no'.  No to dinners out, no to movies, no to shopping, no to a brand new computer....NO TO A BRAND NEW COMPUTER!?!  Oh, my, it's gonna be a long year.

       That Crazy Girl   In America, there are many different religions.  There's Christianity, Judaism, Islam, even a dash of Buddhism.  There's also something called Sports.  This has different sects, just like Christianity has many different sects i.e. Catholicism, Baptism, Protestanism.  Sports' different sects include Baseball, Basketball, and Football.  For Football, just like in Catholicism, there is one major night where everyone, regardless of how lax they have been in their worship the whole year, will pay their respects to their religion and worship--everybody expects it of them.  For us it's Easter Sunday.  For them, it is Super Bowl.   Tonight was Super Bowl for the Football religion, and somehow I got an invitation to repent for all my years of sinning by attending a Super Bowl party.  I asked if there would be communion.  My hostess said there would be chips and dip instead.  I asked would I have to drink wine?  She replied it would be better than that.  Aside from wine, they would also have beer, and other types of alcohol.  I said sure.  So my husband and I attended the worship, and was inspired by their fervent enthusiasm.  I mean, being a Catholic, I'm used to a pretty sedate Mass.  Everyone was jumping and hollering, and laughing, and being merry.  One girl in particular inspired me.  C was gesturing with enthusiasm, screaming louder than everybody else, dancing, gyrating, gesturing things I did not understand...it looked like the holy spirit had taken a hold of her.  She had the rest of us laughing our asses off (this religion seemed very lax on profanity).    At the end of the game, when the New England Patriots won by 1 point from a winning field goal, I was jumping up and down as loud as her.  She turned to us with triumphant eyes.  "Thank you, Jesus!"  she exclaimed (it turned out she was a believer of both Christianity and Sports).  She then revealed that she had bet $1000 on the Patriots and had just won $3000.  The next minute was a blur as the mass ended and we went on our way.  We did not genuflect before we left the altar.  I'm sticking to Catholicism, but discovering other religion is truly refreshing...I wonder if C will have to thite a part of her winnings?  ***  This Week's  Bedroom Fortune :   A new opportunity will soon come your way  in bed .  (Not that funny, but the Japanese buffet we went to did not give out fortune cookies.  When we went to a mall nearby, their Panda Express in their food court was closed.  So I settled for this one, which my husband's jacket pocket coughed up mysteriously.)

       I need to be...   A more patient, calmer person.    Can you believe just moments before walking into our apartment, after shutting off the car's ignition, I was telling myself,  do not get upset or frustrated with you husband tonight. You've been doing too much of that lately .  So I had a ready smile for him when I got inside the door.  Then I saw the comforter that had dried but was still sprawled on our coach.  Then I saw the pile of dishes that had been there since the night before.  Resolution flew out the window.  So sorry, Habeebi....I reall am.  I have the best husband in the world.  I must, must, be nicer....I blame it all on PMS...yup, it's that time.

       Miss Teen Filipina   I am so...well, there's no other way to say it...baduy!  I don't care, I want to share this anyway.  Okay, to those who remember Gaby Concepcion, former Mr. Sharon Cuneta (hehehe), you guys know that he has/had children with other women, right?  Well, through a series of convoluted internet surfing, I found one that's almost the same age as KC Concepcion.  And apparently she is the reigning Miss Teen Filipina having recently won the 2004 competition. Name's Malay Concepcion.  Click  urlLink here  to find out more.     But that's not the weirdest thing.  The weirdest thing is that in the pictures of the competition, who was escorting her but Papa Gaby!  He looked so proud too.  I'm kinda irked at him for his absenteeism as a father to KC.  Oh well, not my problem.  Here are some pics:      As you can see, they're really bad so go visit the official website for better pics...and I'm really so baduy!  Okay, that's the last you'll hear from me about unheard of beauty pageant winners!

       Almost is not good enough   I almost burned the kitchen down.  Since I don't like doing things halfway, this was a disappointment.  I'm kidding. I was horrified when my wonderful T-FAL sauce pan decided to go up in flames.  I turned off the stove in a hurry, rushed to the sink and doused the flames with our sink spray.  Thank you, Lord, for keeping me safe.  When the flames were down (and after placing a frantic call to my hubby), I sponged up the water around the kitchen and examined the metal stove cover-thingie.  It was black.  The culprit was probably oil.  Yikes!  And for what did I go through that trouble for?  Why, boiling some penne pasta for some Pesto pasta, that's what!    That's Hubby's finger picking on the penne   Recipe:  Pasta (Penne, Bowtie) Fresh Basil Grated Pamesan cheese Salt Pepper Olive Oil  Boil pasta, Add finely chopped basil, grated parmesan, salt and pepper to taste and olive oil.  This is my way of doing it.  I'm sure there's better out there.  And Atkin dieters, this is a no-no, sorry!

       1 out of 2   I had a good relaxing weekend.  Except for Saturday when I got violently ill. I have no idea what made me so sick.  The only thing I ate different from two other people who were with me Friday night and Saturday all day were  urlLink Whattaburger  taquitos.  I had the bacon.  The other thing I ate different was this minestrone soup, except by the time I ate it, my intestines were already doing little jigs in my stomach.    I'm very much afraid that the cause of my stomach troubles were the clover chips, the other item no one but me has touched. :(  I was reading the ingredients, and they don't look so benign and I'm wondering whether the air had some bad reaction with any one of this scientific sounding ingredients.  Today I won't eat anything (I don't think my stomach can take it), I called in sick.  My boss kinda put a guilt trip on me saying that another one of my co-worker called in sick.  I told him if I feel better I'd come in.  If my stomach settles, I will.  But I have taken: Mylanta, gasX, tums, and I still haven't felt any better.  ***   What was good about the weekend: Seeing another wedding, making it to workout at least one of the day, found another good chinese restaurant to which I must return to because I wasn't feeling too good when I went there and only had rice and soup.  I also cuddled lazily with hubby all Sunday, except for a quick trip to B&N to browse books.  We finished CSI season 1 Disc 4, The Count of Monte Cristo, and the 25th Hour.  What was bad about the weekend: Getting violently ill. Tuning in to KERA to watch British Comedies and only catching their fund-raising portion. Hubby spending two hours trying to cook pork chops the way my dad cooks pork chops and it turning out inedible.  Hubby stubbing his toes twice the same day (maybe this should be moved to the first list just for its comedic effect).

       Grateful          I've been complaining and whining too much lately.  I want to stop that. I have so many things to be grateful for and so many things to be proud of.  I'm grateful for my wonderful husband, whose patience runs as deep as an ocean and whose love for me he demonstrates in many different ways.  I hope to be always the good and appreciative wife you deserve.  I'm grateful for my Mom and Dad.  I can't believe you two are about to celebrate your 25th Wedding Anniversary!  Let's go to San Antonio or San Marcos! hehehehe..  I'm grateful for my wonderful brother, Jedd, who I wish wouldn't grow up so fast.  I can still remember changing his diapers and him being short enough to hug my leg standing up and now we wear the same size shoes!  I'm grateful for Rhy, who's always been my partner in crime.  We have so many inside jokes, it could fill a hummer.  And lastly, I'm grateful for the weekends.  Those two days when we're allowed to breathe, pause, play, and reflect.    Have a wonderful weekend everybody!

       My Dilemma   My dillema is as follows:   I want to look good.  I mean a more toned, slimmed down, healthier version of myself.  I know I don't look like an ogre, but I want to look better anyway.  That's the one hand.  On the other hand, I love food.  I mean I love it.  I already restrain my appetite, but if I knew I could eat anything and not gain weight I wouldn't. I love the way food looks, smells, tastes.  I love seeing the different variety of it, and when they touch my tongue, it is bliss!  I  wish  I didn't have this clandestine affair with food but I do!  So therein is my dillema. It's like a constant tug-o-war.    And tonight my appetite won.  Cravings ignited by  urlLink Toni's  recent blog about junk food, specifically, Filipino junk food, I finally relented to my cravings and drove out of my way after work to the Asian store we usually shop at.  I didn't even get a cart and good thing too.  The lack of a device to place my snacks in limited how much I could carry, thus limiting my purchase.    Here's a pic of my stash:     Still no Chippy! No Chiz Curls either.  All I could luck out on was Clover Chips (Ham n Cheese flavor) and Nagaraya (Garlic flavored).  I experimented with the party mix (Thai brand and has seaweed wrapped around some of the mix).  Everything else is tried and true.  I bought two bags of Grill-A-Corn, which I imagine is what Oishi's Oheya tastes like, but I'm not sure.  They didn't have the Oishi brand name.  Hubby and I already finished one of the Grill-a-Corn bag....Okay, I finished it.

       21st Century Chauvinists   I just read from  urlLink Cris's  blog that her old alma mater is going to eradicate the sports curriculum for the girls.  Their reasoning is chauvinistic at best, detrimental to the well-being of hundreds of girls at most.  I hate reading crap like this.  I feel like I'm back in the freaking 18th century when I read crap like this.  Just when you think the world has made progress and become civilized, you hear about some act of chauvinism, terrorism against women, degradation of women, from another place, and you've just taken a hundred steps backward.  Because I believe that as long as there are women out there that are still treated as property to be traded, slaves, sexual objects, etc., then we as women haven't really been liberated.  The parents sending their daughters to that school should pull them out immediately.  Each and every one of them.  Then let's see whether they change their policy or not.  I'm just really frustrated.  I'm not a feminist really, or at least not a radical feminist.  I believe in the power of women though.  I believe in our strength.  I don't do anything to further women's causes, but I will do the following:  I will make sure I raise my daughter to believe in herself.  To value herself.  To be strong by herself but be wise enough to accept aid and companionship when needed.  I will raise my son to respect women, to know the value they have in his life.  To listen to their opinions without a thought in the back of his mind that his opinion is better just because he's a man.....

        Weekend Wonders   On Saturday, I woke up a wee bit early and hauled my butt to the gym.  I pulled a freaking muscle. I wanted to feel my triceps tightening so I reached over with my other arm and that's when I pulled my shoulder muscle. How dumb of me.  It feels better now though.  Afterwards, my 'business partner' and I then went to look at two possible investment houses. One had evidence of black mold (very bad in Texas) and we passed.  The other one was a winner but it turned out there was already a contract on it (another buyer). Oh well, no biggie.  I went home, hung out with hubby for a while until my bro came over. Then we headed over to T's house and went out for some Thai Tea w/ Boba (at least I did).  Then went back to T's and played some pool.    Sunday, we went to church with my parents.  Then had a great steak lunch (ribeye) at Saltgrass Steakhouse. MMMmmmm-goooood!  Then we took advantage of a close-out sale at Just for Feet right next to the restaurant and hubby bought a new pair of running shoes.  We caught the 4 pm showing of Dawn of the Dead afterwards.  I hated it. $13 down the drain.  Then hubby and I went home, carting some wedding gifts from my parents house that we had no room for in the apartment.  I took our sushi set, and our pizza maker, as well as some scented candles.  Can't wait to use them all!  The only glitch to our weekend was the discovery that there's a problem with my hubby's oil tank. It's serious enough that I had to drive him to work today and had to wak up too early!  Hubby's new schedule has changed.  Hurray!  His schedule switched from 2p-10:30p to 9 a-6p.  Our schedule will now align better. This is in lign with a promotion and raise he got. But I'm more excited about the fact that our schedule will sort of match.

       Friday Five   This week's Friday Five is interesting  If you...    1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  I would definitely have Moroccan food.  It would be unique, and Americans and other people in general need to know just how delicious Moroccan cuisine is.     2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  I would own a small boutique, that sold home decor,imported from all over the world   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  Suspense/Action? I know exactly what subject matter though.  I've always dreamed about writing a novel about a vampire slayer...hehehe...Read my 100 things and you'll understand the obession.

       Can't Sleep....   Just finished Disc 1 of Sex and the City Season 1.  For those who think this show is worthless, don't attack me.  Not everyone can be as deep as thee.    Random Thoughts: 1. Shredded paper smells a little bad [nothing to do with SATC] 2. I need to taste a Cosmopolitan 3. How can women wear stiletto heels? 4. For that matter, how can women  dance  in stiletto heels? 5. Mr. Big is not that great looking per se, but he has this very strong appeal for me 6. For that matter, Carrie is not that pretty, but same goes for her with the appeal thing. 7. Do all men really fantasize about threesomes? I know my hubby has. 8. How many normal women out there [meaning not kinky, nymphomaniacs, etc.] have done threesomes? And for what reasons? 9. Why did I have to eat that last oatmeal cookie so late at night? 10. Is it really possible to lose 10 lbs.  Seems so hard!   That's it...G'night....

       The Concert Story   The concert was at  urlLink American Airlines Center  and the arena was huge.  Rhy, Jen and I were excited as they started opening the doors to let us through.  This is when the minor glitches began.  The attendant said all she needed from our printed out tix was the bottom part with the barcode.  So we helped her tear off the bottom.  Jen held onto hers, and Rhy, deciding we did not need the rest of the paper, crumpled and threw mine and his out.  We didn't think anymore about it.  That is until, we got to the entrance of our section and found another usher there. We looked at each other.  We went up to her and asked her if Jen's paper ticket was enough to get us in.    "No, you each need a ticket stub to get in."  Yikes! We doubled back, hurried to the West Entrance and dug through the trash bin and found it.  Whew! That was close.  The concert started and I took liberal pics of Tamia and then Missy who put on such a good show.  No, they didn't allow cameras but I snuck mine in.  During the intermission, this big black girl started doing the equivalent of the otso-otso and all sorts of other dirty dance.  People started throwing money at her and a bunch guys started dancing dirty with her.  This only happens in America, I swear.  So I took a picture.  And that was when my camera got confiscated.  Shyet and double shyet.  So I have no pics of Beyonce who was beautiful and who was carried into the stage on a platform covered with white cloth like royalty.  Her voice was phenomenal and her showmanship just very good.  My favorite was her first performance when she sang Baby Boy and shook her booty.  Well she shook her booty the entire time but Baby Boy is my favorite song.  Anyway, maybe it was just very good to me because I have nothing to compare it to.     I got my camera back.  They did not delete the pics, thank goodness.  Will post pics soon.

       Indecent Proposal    Okay, I didn't get an indecent proposal. I just wanted to use the title. It's a very interesting proposal though.  Basically, hubby believes that I can lose more weight if I do resistance training as opposed to doing more cardio-burning activities.  After my umpteenth (I love this word) complain about my weight he turned to me seriously. We were in my car, having just parked in my parent's driveway, and he was about to rush into the house to pee, but he held it for this momentous occasion.    He said he swears to me that if I did what he told me to do in terms of how to work out, I would lose weight so much faster. After seeing my skeptical look, he made the statement more attractive.  He bribed me with another Coach purse if I do what he wants me to do for 2 mos.  Basically, work out four times a week of 1 hour resistance training. I can do cardio if I want but it's not important, and it shouldn't cut into my resistance training.    I said...hell yeah!  The new plan starts as soon as he writes up the sets of exercises he wants me to do.  I get my purse at the end of the 2 mos. after starting.  He will monitor me through, well, nothing.  Since he can't work out with me (he's not a member of the gym and he has no interest in signing up because we have a free gym at the apartment), we will do an honor system he shall trust me to be honorable in sticking to the terms of our agreement.....I don't think there's any way I can lose, eh?   ***  On another note, concert at 7 pm tonight (after a pesky hospital visit for x-rays)! Oh yea! Unbelievable but this is my  first concert ever .  I am so excited.  Note to self: do not forget camera

       Friday Five   Thank Goodness it's Friday.....   1. What was the last song you heard?   "This Love" by Maroon 5 Here's the chorus:  "This love has taken its toll on me She said goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore"   Good song. Better if you know the tune.  Heard this while driving to work.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?   I saw the Passion of the Christ and Along Came Polly   3. What were the last three things you purchased?   Well, I just went grocery shopping so that list is pretty large.  But if I were to disregard the grocery and eating out then it would be: The Da Vinci Code, Coach Wallet, Gap belt.   4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?   I need to have breakfast with this realtor, look at two houses, work-out and visit my family.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?

       I'm feeling it   Yup, the week's flown by fast, the weekend's approaching and I've got my eyes on a restful weekend.  The weather's cooperating too, it's slowly warming up.  From sweater, jackets and scarves, I'm slowly peeling them off one by one.  First the scarf, then the jacket, then replace the sweater with a long-sleeve shirt. I can't wait until I can get to wear my favorite outfit: tank tops, capris and flip-flops.  Maybe the warming weather is responsible for the weekday's faster speed.  Hmmmmm....maybe.  I need to visit my family this weekend. Haven't talked to my Mom since her triumphant win as Ms. Valentine, and to my little bro Jedd in weeks!  I miss them. I think my Mom is probably  tampo  that I haven't called.    But this weather's too good for anyone to remain in a sour mood .  I'm feeling too good, are you?

       Nothing, Nada, Wala   I honestly have nothing to write about. Other than the fact that I worked out last night again. And I'm feeling really good about it. See the gym is on my way home from work. So I have no excuse not to go. I also went to school.  I could hardly stay awake while watching my CBTs (Computer-Based Training).  I managed to finish a lab and one CD though.    I have nothing else.  Aside from the fact that at the gym locker rooms, I get amazed at how many women have no problems baring their breasts.  This includes me.  Cause I practically have no breasteses of my own.    Other than than, there's nothing.  Although I did come home to find hubby in the dark, doing Tai-chi in the family room, following a tai-chi DVD he bought.  And then I took a shower, saw that I had no towel, and yelled for him to bring me one. I said please. I think.  But he was still peeved at being interrupted.  He takes these things seriously.  Me, not so much.  But he loves it, so I keep my not so supportive comments to a minimum.  We also watched Le Divorce.  I didn't think it was worth staying up til 1:30 a.m. for.  Other than that, I have nothing to write about.

       Witchy Weekend   Replace W in Witchy and you'll get how I was over the weekend. I think I was PMS-ing but that is no excuse! I am so grateful my hubby still loves me. He lost his patience with me at the end of the day Saturday (and that is hard to do!), and I apologized.  That's what I love about hubby, he is so patient! (Thank you, babe...)  I was much better Sunday.  Sunday, we again went to East Buffet...must write up new Bedroom Fortunes soon, I'm stockpiling them.  I swear though, this is the last time I am  going to a buffet since it derails my whole fitness and diet plan.  I have managed to work out 4 times last week.  Yay me!    But back to our Sunday. After the buffet, where we watched the Houston Rockets wipe the floor with the Dallas Mavericks, we went to Sack N' Save and got Aloe Vera for hubby.  Co-workers have been telling him it will help his tummy digest better.  We also bought some Costa Rican bananas (mini bananas).  After that we drove out of our way to the only asian store we know of (and the biggest) around our area.  We had a blast browsing!  I stocked up on junk food.  I bought some Hong Kong Grill-A-Corn spicy flavored chips, some Chinese Fried Green Peas, some Pocky  which are like yan-yan except you don't have to dip it into the chocolate, its already got the chocolate on it.  I also bought some preserved prunes that I had co-workers taste last time.  They spat it out instantly.  I love it msyelf though...hehehe. But what upset me was there was no Chippy! The last two times I've visited there hasn't been any Chippy :(.     Hubby spent all the time we were there picking out tea and tea stuff.  He got a new tea cup, and a YamoMotoYama green tea, and ginseng tea which he spent about 10 mins. choosing. He sure loves his tea.  He now has four different teas at home, not counting the special herbs he uses for his tea from Morocco.  Then we worked out. I brought him as a guest to my gym.  After that, we went home, and watched Memento.  And here's my rant to Netflix:   You were supposed to have sent CSI disk 2 and Le divorce on friday and all we get is Memento and you couldn't even send a DVD that doesn't skip!!!!I was over halfway finished with the movie and it kept skipping and skipping and you made me throw the remote at the TV now send me my DVDs and get it right this time!!!!   End Rant.  So I will have to wait for a replacement copy because it kept skipping. Sigh.  I asked hubby whether I had been "good" on Sunday before we fell asleep in bed.  He said yes, it almost made up for Saturday--that is until, I threw the remote at the TV.

       A Quick Review   After reading the umpteenth positive review of  urlLink The Da Vinci Code , I finally got my own copy two days ago.  I just finished.  My recommendation?  Go get a copy! Especially if you're not a hard-core religious person and can keep an open mind.  Its very, very good!  In other news...It's Thursday! Closer to the weekend.  Have been very good at keeping up my attendance at the gym so our $$$ is not being wasted.  Although, I only made it to school once this week so far. I was supposed to go last night but I was too sleepy.  Got home, conked out at 7:30 pm and woke up at 11:00 when hubby got home...then went to bed again at 2:00 and didn't wake up until 9:30 am this morning.  That's 10 hrs. of sleep!  Oh blessed sleep.  Must try to go to school at least one more time before week!  And are there enough exclamation marks in this entry or what!!!

       Selfless   My husband is the most selfless man I know. At least in our relationship. (He can be a devil otherwise :).  He constantly puts my needs and wants before his.  For example, we live on a budget, and he  never  spends money on himself without feeling guilty.  Even a freaking purchase from McDonald's makes him guilty.  So he rarely spends any money on himself.    Our recent foray into the mall over the weekend illustrates this point.  We have gotten a sizable tax refund back, half of which paid a credit card off.  This leaves a lot of money for mini splurges, even after putting away some money for savings.  I've gotten a gym membership for myself and one of my wishlist items, my  urlLink Coach   wallet.  Woody elected to send some money to his sisters.  I had to  force  him to buy something he really wants.  A pair of brown dress shoes.    On Sunday, after a trip to his favorite East Buffet Restaurant with a bunch of friends and Rhy, we were lured to The Parks Mall because of the sales in  urlLink Foley's  and  urlLink Dillard's .  I urged him to pick out a pair of nice brown shoes cause he's been wanting them.  He was agonizing over getting it, even after everyone told him he was getting a good deal on these beautiful Kenneth Cole shoes we found.  It was originally $125 and it was on sale for $71.99.    He finally got it.  He looks gorgeous in them.

       A strong aversion to debt is a good thing   Hubby has posed the question once or twice, what would my life be like if I hadn't met him?  I've given it some thought, and I think that my life would be quite different in one aspect definitely (among many others--but I will just focus on this one for now).  I would have more clothes, and shoes, and probably a more expensive car. But not necessarily savings, or a low credit card balance.  Because of him, my impulses to spend money on the newest fashion is tempered.  Everything is discussed, moderated, saved for.  We like to pay in cash.  He has a strong aversion to debt. The honorable school debts he hold is still like a spectre to him.  Without him, I would have answered that advertisement I keep hearing on the radio about a BMW 325i for only $200+ a month with the speed of a Porsche, never mind paying fees to break my lease with Nissan.  Everytime I pout because I can't buy that black sandals from Aldo, or another shirt from A&F or even Old Navy(!), or that new jean capri pants from Pacific Sunwear, I recall to myself the watchwords of my hubby: moderation, live within your means, and "what's wrong with the clothes you already have? Hehehehe....  I've called my hubby cheap in previous posts.  I still call him cheap, though its always in a joking way.  But living a debt-free existence is, I think, a more care-free existence.  True, I could gratify my impulses instantly with my plastic, and in that sense be care-free.  But that bill will eventually find its way to my mailbox, and then I won't be so worry free.    So cash it is.  Cash for trips (our whole trip to Morocco was all cash), for pleasure, unless its an emergency.  Cash...need to make more of it =)

       A way to end the night   Yesterday I worked the night shift for a co-worker who went on vacation.  Was at work from 2-10:30 pm and we were busy. Actually, make that till 11:00 because the stupid building people decided to wax the floors at about the time we were leaving and wouldn't let us pass through lest we leave footprints.  Grrrr....  I got home tired, hungry, cranky...until I saw what hubby had prepared.  He had been home hours before but had waited to eat with me. In the meantime, while he waited, he had prepared rigatoni pasta in olive oil and garlic, with slices of golden bell peppers, caramelized onions and baby carrots.  The main entree was mouth-watering chicken marsala with mushrooms.  It all went down nicely with a glass of Beringer White Zindfandel rose wine.  A nice way to end the day.   I would have taken pics but we devoured the food within minutes.

       And just like that my Blahs went away...        Gimme some sugar...is what I told my hubby at 9:30 in the evening. He told me Krispy Kreme couldn't possible be open at this time. Nobody bought donuts in the evening. Well yeah, nobody bought donuts in the evening, but Krispy Kremes are a different matter!   When I called the branch closest to us, they weren't open 24 hours like I thought...just till midnight!    We went there and they had a steady stream of drive-through patrons as well as a sprinkling of eat-in customers, including us, who ordered a box of regular glazed (though there is nothing regular about these donuts), and a box of assorted.  What about my diet, you ask....what diet? Hehe....I'm tired of dieting. I figure as long as I'm working out regularly I'll be fine.   **edited to change "nobody bought donuts in the morning" to  evening ...silly me!

       Blah   It was a good weekend...blah blah blah...I seriously need to shake my life up. My life is not exactly exciting. My weekend was your usual fare of relaxation, Japanese food, and movie, w/ Thai iced tea and boba thrown in for kicks. Yeah, we also watched Man on Fire with Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning...the little girl was actually second billing...love her. I tugged at my hubby's arm during the movie and told him for the umpteenth time that I wanted a baby, preferably a little girl...must fast-forward time to when we can afford one. Or two....  Blah...I don't even have a bedroom fortune to laugh about.

       "Stop Grinning Like an Idiot, It's Only Friday!", says she to herself while grinning like an idiot    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  Friends! I actually caught it last night while working out (they have TVs all over the gym, suspended from the ceiling). I didn't know they had hour-long episodes now. Anyway, it was funny and made me a bit nostalgic.   2. What was the last thing you complained about?  I complained that I was bored at my  job.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  I think I told my husband he was handsome last night....don't gag!  Hehehe   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  I threw away my plactic container of orange juice from McDonald's, where I stopped by for breakfast. Was craving their sausage mcmuffin and ordered the regular mcmuffin instead... bitin!  *    5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  I visited  urlLink cia's site .     *this is a Filipino word that roughly translates as  left hanging

       Today is another day   Okay, so yesterday was kind of a bummer of a post. We'll lighten it up for today! =)  I am very happy with my personal life. Of course not entirely happy, as some of my professional frustrations spill into it, and there are some things I want to change. But I am a generally happy person anyway. Here are some things I'm looking forward to, am grateful for, etc...just things in my life that make me happy:   Trip to San Diego! It's in 3 months. But it will hold me over till next year's trip to the Phils.  In San Diego, they have yummy Filipino treats galore...I'll get to taste the empanada I've been craving for!   The summer! I can't wait to buy my first new bikini in 5 years...yup, that's 5 years...i've been wearing the same things over and over...and can't wait to visit a water park to get a much needed tan   Trip to Vegas in November! My hubby is dragging his feet cause he doesn't want to spend the money, but I've been saving like crazy and I'm confident we can afford it.   My coach purse that hubby promised me...hahaha... mababaw  *    The fact that I've been able to regularly work out for 2 and 1/2 months.  There's been a slight improvement in the belly area, but the best improvement is with how I feel.   Almost ready to take my network+ test! Wish me luck.   This real estate deal that is coming together for me and my partner...even if it doesn't pan out, at least I did  something  to make goals a reality instead of giving lip service to it   My hubby of course! He's the best!   Japanse food....gosh, they're so yummy and have been enjoying eating them a lot lately.=)     *this is a Filipino word for shallow

       Funky   I feel like my life is in a funk right now. And not in a good way. I mostly feel like this about my professional life, but a little bit about my personal too.  I just don't think I am cut out for this 9-5 thing. I am too bored, unhappy with the rewards (ie pay, advancement), and unwilling to kiss butt to get ahead.  I look to others who have been able to start their own business. I know  urlLink sinta  is only 20 and she has her own business already.  Very inspirational, at the same time, I ask myself, when can I do the same? I know that I am young, that I haven't 'earned my stripes' so to speak. I have a myriad of things to learn, experience, and struggle with before I can say I don't want to work for a company.  After all, millions of others do it, right?  But I don't want to be like millions of others. I don't want to be in the rat race all my life.  I want to have financial freedom, creative freedom, freedom period.  And sooner, rather than later. My job is, in the big scheme of things, not bad at all.  But I don't want to work for anyone.  I don't want to expend all this energy only for someone else to reap the rewards.  I want it for myself.  I want how hard I work to be directly proportionate to how much I earn, and this can only happen if I was in sales, in which case I'd still be working for somebody to meet their quota...or work for myself.    I have my real estate goals to work toward.  A deal is slowly coming together for me right now that will give me a taste of its reward.  I am young and impatient however, and want to break away right now permanently and go pursue this dream full time.  I can't wait to be able to dictate my own time, set my own goals, set my own quota, have my own office littered with my own stapler, and paper clips, and with my name on a plaque by the door.  Wouldn't it be cool? Wouldn't it be cool to be able to put notices on my answering machine and even on my door, that I'd be closed for a week because I'm off on a vacation with my husband?  One of the dream vacations that is nothing more than a dream to me right now but that I would love to be a reality?  Like that European trip....How sweet to dream...

       Bedroom Fortunes   Take your fortune cookie and add the all-important  in bed  at the end.  -You will soon receive an unusual proposition... in bed   -He who takes notes listens well... in bed !  Both from Empress of China Restaurant  ***   Let me tell you....   Woody and I had Japanese food to the gills, visiting Lava Grill twice over the weekend. Yummy Udon Noodle soup for hubby, California and Avocado rolls for both of us, and shrimp tempura for me.  Plus salad with that great ginger dressing and miso soup!  We watched Kill Bill on Friday night....AWESOME!  I was imitating Pai Mei's laugh all weekend (Uma's trainer).   We also visited the Main Street Arts Festival.  As promised, here are pics:           Click  urlLink here  for more pictures. We had a great time!

       Friday Five   I'm doing this from home, whooohoooo!!!!!   1. What do you do for a living?   My official title is Support Analyst. I answer calls from customers and try to troubleshoot their problems with our software or website.  Sometimes, the problem is that the caller should not own a computer. =)   2. What do you like most about your job?    The people I work with. I've met some really cool people there! The fact that I got to take a job that has something to do with my degree instead of the collections job I thought I would have to take (twas a bad time economically when I graduated).  The pay is pretty good.  My managers are great! My schedule. Our location.    Yes, lemme remember these good things so I won't focus so much on the bad.   3. What do you like least about your job?    Our rush season (before school starts) is absolute hell!  I also hate prissy customers, and customers who should have stuck with a typewriter.    4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...    A caller tries to make me feel stupid by saying I must not know a lot about networks.  Uh, yeah, I know a lot, but I'm not gonna help you reset passwords when I don't have a clue as to who you are! And what the hell are you doing with access to the server if you don't know how to manage it?  I also hate it when I get things wrong.     5. What other career(s) are you interested in?    I want to be a professor, I'm not sure of what though.  I also want to be technical trainer (fly out to teach people on a new software and such). Or teach computers at a private high school or community college.  Anything to get off the phones!

       What's it like to be a girl?   I hate being a girl sometimes.  My good friends from work, and yes, they are all guys (what do you expect in a tech support center?), are all going canoeing this weekend. I was not invited because I'm a girl. I'm so jealous! But yeah, after canoeing they're camping out, and none of them are bringing their significant others.  No girls allowed.  I hate it.  They keep talking about the trip in front of me and whenever I make a comment, B shushes me and tells me it's "guy's talk"...aaarrrghh!    Sometimes...and very few and far between..i wish I was a boy.  I am not a tomboy and have never been, but I get along so much better with guys. Not in a  malandi  *  way but in a totally platonic friendship way.  I have always been able to be one of the guys.  I am very unfussy, they can make their dirty jokes and I even join in sometimes(within reason), I don't get fazed by their "male" comments and talks.  I never did learn how to flirt which is a plus when hanging out with guys because I don't want to cross into that flirting friendship territory.    I have always avoided coming off as a flirt when it comes to guys. So go figure how I snagged my hubby.  For those who wonder whether girls and guys can really be just friends, yes, you definitely can.  It helps if the girl in the relationship has a secure SO.  My hubby is not the jealous type at all and trusts me implicitly.  I have even tried to get hubby jealous deliberately and he didn't(I will chalk that up to him being secure instead of him not caring).  But being a girl in a guy's circle leaves me out of some stuff.  Like this canoe trip! But we're supposed to go haunted house hopping sometime this summer.  I really hope that pushes through.  Okay, let me go back to enjoying being a girl.    *this is a Filipino word for flirtatious...yeah, that's it

       I want it!    Putcha!  * , I got an email from my mentor at school telling me of a way to get educational discounts on software. I was really psyched because I've wanted to get Photoshop CS and it is freaking expensive.  Well, its freaking $150 more expensive there than on Amazon.com! What kind of educational discount is that?    !!( Growl grumble snarl snap foam-at-mouth )!!  I just really want Photoshop, but it's mostly geared to graphics designers.  That's why it ranges anywhere from high $400 to as much as $800.  Does anyone have any suggestion on a design software that won't quite burn a hole in my pocket?    *this is a mild Filipino cussword

       Nothing Much Here   Not much to blog about. I'm very excited about the end of the week. I took Friday off and am looking forward to a fun-filled weekend. I'm also looking forward to this:    Kill BIll Vol. 2!  The DVD for Vol. 1 is already out, but I'm gonna hold off until they come out with the boxed set.  Oh and a little tidbit: Quentin Tarantino is coming out with a Vol. 3...of Vernita Green's daughter in Vol. 1 seeking revenge for her mother's death. Ain't it cool?  But apparently it won't be for quite a while...he said about 10 yrs. Oh my, I'll be in my 30s by then. (For those wondering why I don't just get the pirated DVDs of both, I say I HATE pirated DVDs. Their quality is always poor and they never have any of the exclusive contents the authentic DVDs have.)   Another tidbit, Tarantino is going to be a judge in American Idol sometime soon. Probably this week's show. I'm gonna make sure I watch it!  Downtown where I work is also holding the Main Street Arts Festival this weekend and we're going to that too. Last year when we went was a blast.  That's one thing I love about where I work. I go out the front door of our building and walk into all sorts of events held throughout the year. I'll make sure to take lots of pics so you can all be a part of the experience.

       This week's Bedroom Fortunes:   Good work, good life, good love, good-bye oppression... in bed  (East Buffet)  A good repuation is more important than money... in bed  (Empress of China)  Never turn your back on a friend in need. The favor will soon be returned... in bed ! (Empress of China)  ***  I hope everyone had a great weekend. Hubby and I sure did. I was frustrated that it got colder, rained, and was cloudy all weekend and therefore couldn't enjoy my new capris to the fullest.  Yes, my newest wardrobe arsenal is this khaki capris I bought from Old Navy over the weekend. Old Navy really has amazing prices. This Vietnamese family ahead of us in the checkout line bought massive quantities of clothes that rang up to $280. When I went on a shopping rampage (right before hubby and I decided my credit card would do less damage if left at home at ALL times), i spent about the same amount on 5 pcs. of clothing. So get ye to an Old Navy near you!  One thing I will not do again is go bikini shopping with Hubby around. You'd think he would appreciate me trying on all these bikinis on for him but he kept rushing and looking shell-shocked at the prices. That's okay, I'll hold off on my purchases until I enjoy shopping a bit more. I plan to lose 5 lbs. in the next month and then shopping's on, baby!  We watched Hellboy and the Alamo. Hellboy is recommended but Alamo, unless you're really interested in the story of the Alamo, not so much recommended. I was bored half the time. I think the LOTR movies have spoiled any future epic movies for me.    Church was packed. Felt sorry for poor hubby but grateful that he accompanied me.  I really should learn a bit about his religion cause he's been so good with mine.  Ate out too much. We hit the buffet again over the weekend. Hubby is obsessed with them.  During the movies, they advertised this new buffet restaurant, and when we passed by it, he just had to go in and check out the food and prices even though it was already 9:30 at night.  Well he's buffet obsessed, I'm blog-obsessed. Thank goodness mine has less calories...

          Have A GREAT Easter Weekend Everyone!      (or just a plain Great weekend to those that don't celebrate Easter)  ***  Sucess! I made Pesto Pasta again for our potluck at work today and people loved it. I had 2 asking for the recipe!   But what a good potluck...bbq and sausages, beans, potato salad, lasagna, bread (can you say carbs galore?), my pesto pasta, meatballs and rice, and my absolute favorite, curry w/ pork over white rice (had 3 servings)!  Yum!  And co-worker K, one of our older co-workers, brought home-baked desert, called Better Than Sex....that's right, it was called Better Than Sex...boss referred to it as 'BTS' to be PG.   Funny story: P, another co-worker who brough the curry and white rice, asked me to go to the kitchen with him before the potluck started.  He then proceeded to show me how to cook rice.  I thought he has some unique way of cooking rice, or had something interesting to show me, but it became apparent he, this tall, red-haired guy, was showing me, the Asian, how to cook rice!  I interrupted him.    I told him, "Uh, I've been cookiing rice since I was ten years old!"  I now have officially 1 hr and 40 min. till freedom.  We did NOT close early.

       The ones you shouldn't let go of...   I love my hubby! He is so unique.  Right now, as I am typing this, he is watching his Qi-Jong (pronounced Chee-cong) DVD, and following the slow, calculated movements of the old guy on it, all to the sound of Chinese instrumental music.    Have you ever heard of a Muslim/Arab who does tai-chi and qi-jong?  Who has a black belt in wushu, who can speak five languages, who refers to his take-to-work lunch as ' baon ' * , who can do flips in the air, who wakes you up in the in morning to say good-bye and whisper to you that there's eggs and bacon waiting for you on the kitchen table?  I have, and he's looking pretty Asian to me.  ***  On another note entirely, my allergies are acting up again.  The warming weather seems to be triggering it.  And, just like what I wrote in my  urlLink 100 Things , I sneeze loud.  I sneeze so loud at work that people on the other side of our floor can hear and will Instant Message me a 'bless you'!    *Tagalog word for packed lunch

       I See Ya, IKEA!   The good news: An IKEA store is opening in my metroplex.  The bad news: It's not opening until Summer 2005.  But as long as its coming....  ***    Take Me Away   The US does not have a Holy Week.  The Catholic and Christian churches celebrate the corresponding masses, but there is no week-long reflection where there is no work or school.  This is one of the things I miss about Philippines a lot.  Admittedly, nowadays Holy Week in the Philippines is not spent reflecting on Jesus' life but on a holiday away from the daily grind...Tali, Boracay...Oh, I'm dreaming of Boracay. I cannot believe we have white, powdery beaches in our country with clear waters. Just a plea from a future visitor to those currently visiting...Don't spoil it! I hope when I visit next year, it is still pristine, not teeming with trash or anything else except marine life.  I really need to get away. I think, next week, I'll take a day and a 1/2 off.  I have to preserve my vacation days for the trip to Cali (July) and for Vegas (November). But next year...Philippines, and Boracay for 3 weeks!

       Scummish?                        I just finished the Danielle Steele paperback I bought the other day. Of course it was predictable, but I bawled my eyes out in the beginning, especially at the part where her a#$ of a husband tells her he wants a divorce after 20+ years of marriage so he can boink someone 20 yrs. younger, and she was blind-sided.  Gosh, men are such scum!  Of course not everyone. My husband, and a lot of other people's husbands/boyfriends, are examples of thoughtful, caring, responsible men. I commend men who are raised in machismo society, or even is societies where women are considered second class, or are subjugated, and have risen above that.    My hubby is one such man. As much as I loved Morocco, it was painfully obvious to me that the majority of the men there were the bosses of their wives. Not naming names, I constantly came across men who did not allow their wives to own a passport so they can't travel, men who though they were too manly to change their baby's diapers, men who expected the women around them to pick up after their discarded beer bottles.  I told hubby in no uncertain terms, that I would never live in a country where women were consistenly subjugated, and where the religion and government condones and even promotes such subjugation. No matter what problems America has, I won't have to worry about having the men in my life (father, husband, brother) permission to make decisions.    But, like I said, my hubby did not become like the men he had grown up with.  He told me stories of waking up early with his mother, while the rest of the household slept, and cooking breakfast for her. When we visited Morocco, he would often get upset at him mother for not sitting down and relaxing, and instead was taking care of everyone's needs.  His mother is his hero.    I know that this entry stinks of feminism and man-hating. Its not meant to. Or if it is, I don't care. It's my blog, right?  But I don't hate men. Not the good ones anyway.  ***  Sidenote: I read a really great article off of Time Asia online about the growing rate of divorce in Asian countries initiated by women.

       Monday, One Hour Earlier   We had to jump our clocks forward on Sunday by one hour and now I feel so cheated of time! I know its no big deal. Just one hour. So why did this weekend feel so short? Maybe I was having too much fun? Hmmm.....  Weekend Summary:   Lost $5 on a bet with T on what time our favorite Asian coffee place, Bethany Cafe, closes.  I hate being wrong....Grrrrr.....   Had a great work-out Saturday morning!   Indulged my cravings for Japanese food...California rolls, shrimp and veggie tempura, tepanyaki, miso soup...yum!   Browsed at Barnes and Noble, debated between The last Juror and Angels and Demons....settled for Angels and Demons   Watched Cold Creek Manor...and snored throughout the movie.   failed to wake up Sunday morning to work out...bad me....did not go to church for Palm Sunday...double bad   Had a great visit with my family....Dad's barbecue is the best!   Bought a  mababaw  book, a Danielle Steele paperback....I dunno, the first few lines were interesting.   I also read two blogs complaining about plagiarism.  Some even copying entries as if it was their own life events.  How sad.  This prompted me to disable right-click on my blog so as not to be able to view source code. Although, I'm first to say that this is a template...if you like the look of it, you may find it at Maystar Designs under Credits.  Please, though, don't copy personal entries as your own!  That's just....really pathetic.

       Sometimes When You Get that Feeling...   I love food.  I get cravings. Even though I'm not pregnant (cross fingers cause we're not ready).  So I've been having these cravings for Japanese food.  I don't even like sushi with fish! The most I can take is crab meat.  I can eat the vegetable sushi though, and California rolls are yummy too.  And shrimp tempura, teppanyaki(sp?), yeah, I'm gonna visit a japanese restaurant this weekend.  Hubby prefers it to be a Japanese buffet though.     What's everybody's plans this weekend?  Whatever it is, enjoy and be safe!

       Is it Filipino women? Or is it just women in general?   I know of a woman who lives in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex. She is Filipino.  Apart from her immediate family (husband, children) she has no other relatives.  In Houston, she has plenty of  kababayans  * ; folks from her hometown, people she grew up with, even a first cousin or two.  Every time she gets together with them they urge her to move there. She smiles, she agrees it would be great. But secretly, she thinks to herself that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and proximity makes it cold.    This woman's philosophy is that the further away she is from Filipinos, especially other Filipino women, the less intrigue and strife she'll have to deal with.  She has relatives in California, plenty of them.  And she tells me she shudders to think what it would be like if she lived close to them.  She's afraid of the jealousy, the comparisons, the gossip, the back-stabbing.   Is this how women are? Is this how Filipino women are?  I am asking this because I don't like to think that this is how we women are like. Especially the Filipino women. But why is that stereotype so often reinforced? Even in the blogging world, there is still this type of intrigue and in-fighting among Filipino women. I mention Filipino blogs because that's most of what attracts me in the blogging world. But I know that its not just Filipino women that exhibit this catty behavior.    Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we tear other women down? Lose friendships over men, gossip, form exclusive cliques? Someone prove me wrong! Someone tell me of good friendship stories; frienships that last, women who get along and handle conflict well.    Maybe the in-fighting happens because as women, we are not taught how to handle conflict well at all. We are taught to avoid conflict. To get along with everyone. When conflict happens, we have no skills to cope with it. This is just a theory that got formulated while writing this entry.  Anyone have any other ideas?    * Filipino word for people from your own hometown

       Spontaneous Weekend    urlLink    Poses everybody! The friends we came to the lake with.&nbsp; urlLink     I got sand all over my clothes, my bag, my hair. I got bitten by fire ants, got my skin torn off, all on the same foot. I skinned my elbows. I found out that I am not as fearless as I used to be when sliding down slides, jumping off diving boards and swinging off bars.  But boy, did I had a great time!   Saturday night, we got invited to go Sunday to a local lake.  Woody and I hemmed and hawed and I'm not sure why. Maybe because we liked having our weekends planned and we had planned to stay in and do nothing?  Then we reasoned, why do the same old thing?  So Sunday morning we got hot dogs and hot dog buns,chips, drinks and paper plates and cups and a tube of sunblock.  We were going to get some sun!  We had a great time with our friends. I got what I called a "pre-tan". Not quite a tan. We gorged on burgers (our friends brought them), among other things.  I overcame my fear of this bar that swung over the lake and that people jumped off of.  Okay, it took a lot of convincing, and of a kid coming by saying even his four year-old brother could do it, but I did it too!

       Reviving the Bedroom Fortunes   It's been a while and I've missed them. I scrambled to find some to post it and here's what I found lurking in my pockets, purses, and counter tops.  Remember, all it takes to transform a fortune into a Bedroom Fortune is to take the fortune and add the all-important  in bed  at the end.  Beauty is skin deep, take the time to get to know a person... in bed   Laughter is the best medicine when disappointments strike... in bed   Last but not least...  Be amiable, be flexible, be discerning, but firm and friends will flock to you... in bed !

       Quick Reviews   Some DVDs and Movies I watched over the weekend:   Timeline --Paul Walker is considered by some to be eye candy. That's all he is. He has no acting talent whatsoever, and the only redeeming quality of this movie was the laughs it gave hubby and me cause we were making fun of it the whole time.    Cheaper by the Dozen --I loved the kids! They were so cute. Hilary Duff was a tad annoying. Tom Welling was another eye candy but with actual talent. He should have been on the screen some more (wink, wink).  It was a light-hearted comedy that's good for the whole family. It also made me want to have kids. Hehehe...   The Family Guy  (various episodes)--This is the freaking funniest show I've seen in the longest time.  Very Simpsons-like in its dysfunctionality but it has its own brand of charm and hilarity. Go see it!  It was canceled in  season 3 but they're bringing it back because of high demand.  And last but not least....   Troy   What can I say about this movie? Except that Brad Pitt was hot. Really Hot.  Eric Bana was also hot. Really hot. Orlando Bloom was cute. Really cute.  (Pauses to wipe drool from mouth).  I echo what other women have mentioned. These good-looking guys were a bit of a distraction at times. How can I concentrate on Achilles' inner turmoil when his torso is so ripped?  All lusting aside, it was an enjoyable, well-acted, well-directed film. Peter O'Toole was stirring in his performance, and the ballet-style duel between Achilles and Hector was a sight to see. I give it a thumbs-up.   Other Highlights of my Weekend   Gave my brother his b-day gifts. He's now 11 years old! I chose a wooden samurai sword for him, and hubby got his a foam nanchuk.   We celebrated his b-day at Saltgrass and I had the yummiest cheesecake from there. It was soooooo good. And I don't even like cheesecake!  Man, can't wait for next weekend!

       The Beautiful People    These Morocco pics (taken from last year's summer trip to Morocco) are making me reminisce about what fun we had. I met so many wonderful people, discovered so many things about my hubby as a child, was warmly introduced to his wonderful family.   I have to say one thing that struck me the most about Moroccans were how physicaly beautiful they were. They had such ranges of beauty as well. From fair-skinned to dark-skinned, from Latin looking, caucasian looking. The only thing missing were Asian looking ones!  Filipinos are beautiful too, of course. But everyone from the Philippines must have the experience of being in a "palenke" (wet market) or a particularly poor area, and seeing the weather-beaten, haggard, faces of our working/poor class, their hardships etched on their faces.    When I went to the wet market in the Northern area of Morocco (close to the Spanish territory), their vendors, their poor, were so gorgeous.  Gorgeous faces, with great skin, brown, even blue and green eyes. They were the equivalent of our mestizas, I suppose, their blood comingled with Spanish ones.    Here are some of the beautiful children I came across in Morocco: Unsa and Wafa, niece and daughter of my sis-in-law's housekeeper.   Miriam,mom-in-law's best friend's grand-daughter   My nephew, Ali

       Hilarious!   My husband is the funniest. I'm adding walking in the park for 30-45 min. on the days that I don't go to the gym as part of my fitness routine. Well yesterday evening, while it was still sunny we walked through the park near our neighborhood.  We had fun with hubby threatening to throw me over the ravine, me threateningly pushing him too.  These are the days when hubby calls be an angel, cause I'm not easily irritable and witchy with a "b".    Anyway, we're really very playful and silly.  So hubby turns to me on our walk back to the apartment and suggested we start snarling at each other if we meet someone on the path so we could freak them out. I burst out laughing. He is so bizarre with his train of thought. And I am sure he would have done it too if I had agreed. He is that weird... and unique.   I don't know what I would do without him.  I'll definitely miss him when I go to San Diego. I've already booked my flight! Woohoo!  It'll be minus hubby because he didn't think it was worth $300 plus each to spend not even a week there.  Plus there are 2 other people who have already approved for vacation in his department for the same 4th of July weekend.  My mom's not coming either.  Speaking of paying $300 plus for tickets. My grandma paid a little less than $200 for her ticket from San Diego to Chicago through Southwest Airlines. But Southwest has no flight between Dallas to San Diego so I didn't get a bargain. Sucks!

       God Help the Philippines   In the latest poll on  urlLink inq7.net , FPJ supposedly maintains the lead in initial, unofficial count.  I am saddened, disappointed and feel helpless over this turn of events. We Filipinos knew it would be a close call, but I thought GMA would pull through in the end.  I want to declare that this country is going to the dogs....but I don't want to lose hope yet. As staunch Catholics, the Filipinos surely know of the saying, God's will be done.  I am going to believe that this is God's will.  I am going to believe the HE has something planned for the Philippines, for the Filipinos, under the umbrella of an FPJ presidency.  Maybe FPJ will prove all our fears, doubts, criticisms, unfounded....We can only hope.  While on this subject, I would just like to say, to those Filipinos that could vote but didn't register, or were registered but didn't vote at all, shame on you. I wish I could have voted, but I'm no longer a ciziten of the Philippines.   For those who vehemently opposed FPJ, but didn't vote for GMA but for another candidate instead, you must have realized that a vote for anyone else lessened the vote for GMA, the only one who could have beaten FPJ.  That's all. Maybe some miracle will happen soon with our country.

       I love the new look!   I love the new layout and settings for blogger. Just wanted to throw it out there. For non-blogger users, sorry.  Things on my mind right now:  Who won the Philippines Presidential election? The suspense is killing me!   Will Grissom and Sara actually start a romance? Aaaarghh!!!..no one answer this. I don't want to know yet.   Okay, those two are actually the only questions burning in my mind right now.    ***  Weekend update:  Hubby and I were supposed to go clubbing again with some friends of ours. On their way to our house they got into a wreck with a huge F150 truck, jacked up on suspension and gigantic tires. They were driving a small Mitsubishi Galant.  Guess whose car sustained more damage?    For those of you that need to compare, the truck was like one of thos Monster Truck Rally trucks.   I felt very bad for my friends. Hope they sort it all out.  But as a result of that, we didn't want to go out anymore. So we actually made our first visit to Blockbuster in months!  We rented a Kung Fu movie for hubby and, believe it or not, CSI Season 2 Disc 5. I couldn't wait anymore. I really thought they would develop the relationship between Grissom and Sara further, but no go.  On Sunday I treated Mom out to a  Mother's Day late lunch. Next weekend, we are going for a massage. It would have been this weekend but she had work.  Our lunch was at a cafe & bakery in a nice mall, and my, there were so many well-dressed families out that day! I saw a lot of mothers having a great time, mine included!  Sunday night, I played some Sim flash games from  urlLink ebaum's world  and did not get to bed until 2 am.  I am now contemplating buying the actual Sims game. However, there is a good possibility, hubby would disown me. He's already upset with the amount of time I spend on the computer. Adding Sims to the repertoire would be too tempting for me.  So maybe not.

       Intelligence is Sexy   Am I crazy for thinking Gil Grissom of CSI is sexy?!  My husband does. But in Grissom's character, I can see how smart can be sexy. He is so very scientific, analytical, unbiased, open-minded and intelligent and, I'm sorry, but I find all of it very sexy.  I'm now only on the 2nd season DVD, disc 4, and last night, we watched the episode where the very introverted Grissom sends Sara Sidell plant (instead of flowers) to convince her not to leave CSI.  And the next episode has Grissom alluding to beauty related to Sara.  I find it all so very exciting, so-for lack of a better word- kilig *  !  Does this make me crazy?!  Husband finds it weird that Sara is so young and he calls Grissom, a dork.  I disagree.  I can't find a better fit for Grissom than Sara and at this day and age, it is trite but true to say that age doesn't matter.  I cannot believe my favorite romantic couple in television is a couple who are not even that romantic but rather, very scientific.  And a disclaimer...I have not been watching the show as it currently airs.  I will wait to progress watching through my Netflix DVDs.  ***    Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there! I salute you all!      * this is a Tagalog word that roughly translates to exciting in a romantic way...there's no adequate English word translation for it.

       Then and Now   As an ode to my childhood, I thought it would be nice to post a picture of my 3rd grade class in my alma mater, O.B. Montessori Center.  I can still see the old me sometimes when I look in the mirror.  I'm the tall one in the middle. Funny how everyone thought I would grow up so tall, and now some of those pictured shorter than me are now taller by far!:     Here's a close-up. I look mataray but was actually sad and had been crying. My mom had yelled at me that morning.

       Hello Monday!   Another week, another chance to better myself. I've noticed my posts come off as being so bipolar. One post, I'm all positive, the next I'm all complaining. LOL.  This weekend I found friends on Friendster from years back.  Way back from my grade school years! I found  urlLink Melissa Ann , although she still has not added me as her friend :b (just kidding MeAnn)! I considered her my best friend in those days.  I found Joely, and Mary and a score of other people, even my 2nd grade and 3rd grade teacher!  I joined Friendster a couple of months ago but never did anything with it.  This is exactly what I wanted to do! Find my OBMC friends!  How cool.   Mine and hubby's weekend was very nice. Except for Saturday. I turned into an evil witch monster again. We went clubbing and everything seemed to rub me the wrong way and I blamed hubby for it all.  I don't know how he puts up with me. Sunday, we visited my family.  Dad, Woody and Jedd watched the Punisher, while Rhy, Mom and I watched Mean Girls.    I have to say that Mean Girls was funny, well-written and a very superior teen movie. I love Lindsay Lohan. I've loved that girl since she was in the Parent Trap. Although she isn't a little girl by any means, as evidenced by her ample, ahem, assets. I wish kids wouldn't grow up so fast.  My little brother is up to my shoulders now. Not so little anymore.  ***   Gotta love Coach   And despite losing only a pound since I started working out, hubby has rewarded me with the promised and long-awaited Coach purse!  I didn't get either the buckle demi or the tote.  I got the slim pouch instead.  The buckle demi was just too small!

      Everybody who wasn't blessed with monetary richness knows how hard it is to pay all your monthly expenses plus spend a little on extras without depleting your bank account. We all have to work hard to make everything add up just right.  In the U.S. the average household holds $8000 in credit card debt alone, so I guess a lot of people are not having an easy time making expenses and income equalize. One type of business booming across the U.S. today are payday loan businesses, where they extend you a loan against your coming paycheck.  This is supposed to be done for emergencies, but analysts have found that these payday cash advances are used for anything as trite as going shopping or a spa getaway.  The interest on these? Anywhere from 200-1368% APR!  Think this is exaggerated? Google "average interest payday loans" and you'll see countless articles verifying this.   Has America gone insane?  Or is it just a fact of life manifesting itself in a way that capitalists can take advantage of; that of limited resources, unlimited wants?  Or maybe P.T. Barnum said it best when he said "There's a sucker born every minute."  We may shake our heads at people who go to these lengths to pay bills, but the truth is, most people don't know where their money is going. You can itemize the big ticket items like your rent/mortgage, car, insurance.  Unless you itemize every single penny you spend for a month of two, you won't notice that you spend about $500 a month on that cigarette habit, or $1200/month on eating out for lunch, or $1000 on clothes.   When I started keeping track of my expenses on an excel spreadsheet, I didn't know I spent almost $800 a month on items I marked as miscellaneous.  Things I didn't need.  The hardest part about being on a budget is that you can't lie to yourself and tell yourself you've got a couple of hundred dollars left to do this and that.  Your bottom line on that damn spreadsheet is telling you that you don't. So I can't tell myself that I can spend whatever I want on this upcoming San Diego trip. I have to be on a budget.    The best part about being on a budget is that you can't lie to yourself anymore and dig yourself deeper in debt. If you lie to yourself anyway, then you're just a sucker.

      Since I am out of material, check out an ongoing political debate sparked by a reader's comments in  urlLink Sassy's  blog.  Since I am not really politically-minded, I don't usually discuss US politics on my blog. If you'd like more than just food-talk, book-talk, and girl-talk to churn your "little grey cells", then follow the link and voice an opinion.   Here's something new about me: I am a sucker for debates. I don't necessarily want to get in the middle of one, but reading or watching a good debate where the debaters are well-informed and particularly eloquent is something I enjoy very much.

      I've got nothing on my mind but the California trip I'm about to leave for on Saturday. I need to do so many things like get my eyebrows done, buy some additional clothes, maybe get my toenails done. I have to set my mind at ease by tidying up the house and doing other chores, plus leaving instructions with hubby before I leave.   Since San Diego has a large Filipino population I am looking forward to visiting the Filipino bakeries and shops there. I may also visit Jollibee! Yup, they have a Jollibee branch in SD.   Funny thing hubby pointed out. Whenever I mention visiting Philippines, San Diego or any other place, I always mention all the food I want to taste there. Hubby asked me if I am visiting for the food! I say its part of the experience, right?  Or maybe I am a bit food crazy. Just a bit though.

         When near vermilion, one gets stained pink; when near ink, one gets stained black    - From the pages of  urlLink Falling Leaves  by Adeline Yen Mah  This Chinese saying is meant to imply that your environment rubs off on you. What you surround yourself with shapes you and you begin to adapt what you surround yourself with. I've often wondered if this is true? The thoughts in Psychology circles vary and often vacillates between environment, genetics and a mixture of both as being the major determinant of a person's character.  On one hand there are multiple studies of twins separated at birth ending up with similar lives. Same occupation, same name, same habits, even their spouses sometimes ended up being very similar to each other. On the other hand you see so many stories of children from bleak backgrounds overcoming their environment to make a success of themselves.  My psychology teacher back in college once said, that a person's character was akin to music. Music is produced by an instrument as well as by the musician playing it. Now, how do you measure how much of the music is the instrument, and how much the musician?  It is impossible.  I like to think that people can rise above their environment. Without this belief, you leave people with no hope. If all you have been taught is suffering, and all you've been surrounded with is pain, then what's the point of struggling to make something of yourself?  I believe that people can overcome their backgrounds and once a person can think logically, that person can also think critically and not just go on thinking what they've been exposed to.   What does everyone think? What is it ultimately? Nature versus nurture? I like to think that we're like music.

       Things on my mind right now    My San Diego, California trip   The fact that international postage for anything less than 16 oz. is 3.80 and therefore I had to rip the $0.37 US stamps that I stuck on a b-day card headed for the UK. Doh!   Why can't my husband put things AWAY and/or BACK WHERE HE GOT THEM FROM? Is this a hard concept; am I being anal?  Don't answer that.   How come this 70+ woman at the gym last night had a better body than I did?   Can I keep up my savings habits and still have fun?   The fact that I cannot seriously look for another job until after my Pinas trip next year since I want those three weeks off   Am I slowly going crazy? Don't answer that either

       Block those strong emotions   I just read  urlLink Memoirs of a Geisha  and I have to say that it is one of the best book I have read in a long time. Beautifully written, well-paced (until near the end). I am very fascinated with Japanese culture and the lives of these socially condoned flirts and mistresses is even more so.  Alongside my enjoyment was dismay at the fact that these women were forced into the life they were living. That they were being treated as object, prizes to be won, with their virginities up for grabs in an auction as young as 15 years of age.  They were subjugated, and whatever rights they enjoyed was directly proportionate to how much money they earned, by entertaining constantly and by acquiring a  danna  or sugar-daddy.  The number of geishas has dwindled to almost extinction, but there are still some of them in circulation.   I wonder how it would be if the roles were reversed and we had men, trained from childhood on how to please women? Now that would be something.

       Have you ever...?   Because I have strong urges to have a baby that can't be quelled, I thought to satiate some of this urge by baby-sitting.   Friday night last week, I shooed my co-worker and his wife out of their home to take care of their 2 sons, "Ko" and "Ja", aged 4 and almost-2 yrs. old, respectively.  You would think that the boys would dispel some of the allure of being a mother. You would think they'd be rowdy boys, unruly, loud and hard to handle. My co-worker's dog was harder to take care of. Ko and Ja were absolute angels and the 2 year-old came to me so easily, without fuss.    Baby-sitting them did not help. Instead, I was charmed by their innocence, their angelic smiles. How can I not fall in love with boys that smell like angels?   It's so difficult to wait. But we're not ready. I'll just babysit again next week.

       Finally resurrected!   My PC is back up and I'm typing this entry from home. Glad to be back.   As promised, here are pics to show what a wonderful Philippines Independence Day we had. My mom's reign as Reyna Elena was a direct result of her win as  urlLink Miss Valentines  last February. My Dad could have been escorting her but he was gone for a wedding in Chicago. My brother took his place!      The Reyna Elena and her escort, my brother (Man in Black)    The cute kids     The little angel    I asked her to pose for me. Such bright colors! I love our flag!    I call this picture "windblown".     And here's the empanada my dad brought back!    And here is my family taking over my dining room.  Click for more pics  urlLink here .

       Coming soon to a post near you   I want so much to update but my PC's still on hiatus and I don't want to post without pics. So here are my topics with pictures to come:  -Santacruzan! Did you guys know it was the Philippines Independence Day last Saturday? Well our little Filipino community had a santacruzan to accompany it. My mom was Reyna Elena.... bonga mother ko! *. -Empanadas! Got 'em flown from Chicago by my dad who attended a wedding there. They were a day old, so they were not in top form, but still... -Pictures, pictures, pictures! I'll be posting lots of them hopefully by tomorrow.   Abangan! **   Bedroom Fortunes   And to tide us over until tomorrow (hehehehe), here are some fortunes to laugh over. Remember the rule: add  in bed  at the end of your fortunes.  -Keep up the good work! in bed ! -What we love to do, we find time to do  in bed ! (Ain't this the truth!).    *Ain't my mother grand!     **Watch out for it!

       Friday Five revisited   I really, really missed them, so when I saw that there is now an  urlLink livejournal online community  for friday five, I was very happy!    1. If the world were to suddenly end right now, what do you wish you would have done?  I wished I had told my family and husband that I loved them, that I had sky-dived, gone white-water rafting, visited the countries I wanted to visit.  All the goals I had outlined to accomplish when I was in high school.   2. How many times do you hit the snooze button before getting out of bed?  About 3-4. I'm really, really bad at it.   3. What cartoon do you enjoy watching from the present (or the past)?  I loved Tiny Toons, and now enjoy Dexter's Laboratory and Power Puff girls though I haven't watched any cartoons in a long time (or any TV for that matter).   4. If you could go to any time and/or place in history, where/when would it be?  I've always wanted to go back to the fifties cause of the cool fashion. I really loved the way ladies dressed back then.   5. If your life were a movie, what would it be rated and why?  I'd rate my public life a PG-13, but my life behind closed doors with husband "Restricted" (wink, wink)     Have a Great Weekend Everyone!!

       Update on my PC woes   For now I must lay my dream of a new PC down to rest. After testing the power supply of my old PC, it turned out to be the power supply. I am off to buy a $12 power supply replacement from Fry's Electronics.  That's all that's wrong with it and so we cannot justify buying a new system.  I am sad. Very sad.  But I am happy too. Because this means we will leave our $$ untouched save for $12.  And this means more money for my upcoming SD trip and others.   I am happy...I guess. :)

       I just realized I'm a feminist   I never really realized it, never really dwelled on it. Maybe its because I hate labels, maybe its because for some reason, I associate "feminists" with negative connotations or with bra-burning, picket lining, butches...no offense to anyone.  Recently however I was speaking with a colleague about how much I loved Hermione's character from the Harry Potter books, and how she is the true hero of the books as opposed to Harry Potter. We went back and forth, me pointing out that she is the one who always comes up with answers and tactics in resolving their gang's problems. Finally, not seeing eye to eye, I ended it by saying, "Well, I still favor Hermione." To which my friend replied, "well that's because you're a feminist."  I paused and reflected. Is this true? i asked myself. And after some recollections, the evidenced piled up. I guess I am!  First, in my marriage, I am no cooking, ironing, cleaning, Martha Stewart home-maker.  Much as I admire those wives who are, I scoff when hubby even hints that these are things I "should be doing". I don't think so. I'll cook my turn, you cook yours. I usually clean because hubby has allergies that flare up when dusting, spraying cleaners etc., but I don't care about house decorations. I iron only when really needed. In fact, hubby cooks better than me, so I usually "let him" cook more often. Ha!  Second, I hate girly-girls. Girls who are always "pa-cute", or can't live without men, always agonizing about their next boyfriends. I prefer girls with personality and attitude. For example, I gag over Lana Lang's always-smiling (simpering) character in Smallville and prefer Chloe who has more substance.  I love, love, love Buffy and any girl who can kick ass!  I am overly sensitive and cynical towards our patriarchal society and bristle at hints of subservience from women or sexism and biases against women.  I guess I was lucky to be raised around and by a group of strong women. Both grandmothers, my mom, and aunts. They all possess(ed) strong personalities and most of the time, were the bosses of their household. :)  But I still don't know if I can really be called a feminist.

       I Love Harry Potter   And Ron's getting cuter. And Hermione's getting to be a pretty little lady, smart as ever, AND kicks ass!  I thought she was more the hero of the movie than Harry. I mean, c'mon, she was the one leading Harry through the time turner thing, she's the one who did the wand trick that got Sirius out of the cell in time...if I'm ruining the movie for you , sorry.  I just love Hermione! There's actually scores of people that think Hermione really carries the book and not Harry Potter, despite the titles. :)  And I feel so stupid, but I get  kilig  during those few and far between moments that Ron and Hermione show affection for each other, a preview of things to come.  As a disclaimer, I am an avid Harry Potter fan. I even took myself and my little brother to the midnight launch of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at Barnes and Noble the day it came out.   One funny anectode: I was trying to imitate Hermione's very kick-ass way of unlocking the cell door using the Alohomora spell and my shoulder bag went up and its strap hit me on the face! I swear, sometimes, I am too goofy for words.

       I didn't break it, I swear!   With no manipulation of my own, our 4 year-old, bane-of-my-existence PC's motherboard died last night! Hubby has given me the green light to shop around for a new one. I was thinking of building my own, but hubby nixed the idea. He wants something with a warranty and in-home service.    Happy girl, is me!  I'm probably gonna go with a Dell, as our company uses them and I do have to say they are superb machines. Their tech support leaves a lot to be desired, from what I've heard from people who have worked there and have called in to them.  We also have a company discount with them. Does anybody have any other suggestions?  The downside part is, I did not backup the contents of my hard drive! What kind of a tech am I, you ask? Obviously one that performed a big oversight. But I'll have no problem taking our hard drive and sticking it into one of our boxes at work or at a friend's house and extracting the files I need.  Wish I had done it sooner. Kicking myself right.....now! Ow!  Edited to add:   My bubble is pricked. Why? Why is my hubby so stubborn? We need a new PC! Now he wants to backpedal and just replace the motherboard. Why me? Ahuhuhuhu!

        I am B.R.O.K.E    Itemized receipts, added up expenses, tinkered with my spreadsheet, felt this burning hole in my pocket and the diagnosis was clear...we're broke!  Ah that feeling of desperation, of anticipating your next paycheck with double-time eagerness...Been there, done that...we'll get over it.   On another note...   We lost power tonight for about an hour. With the storm raging outside, our little apartment was all peace...no humming air conditioners, computers, or TV. Just candles soflty lighting the room and blanket and pillows sprawled on the carpeted floor.  Hubby and I were alone with no technology to disturb us. And I told him I was glad he was with me.

      Note: I've been very hesitant on whether to post this or not. I feel like I'm baring my sould with this post. But, I decided to go for it. If  urlLink Christine  can be brave and others too, so can I. Here goes. (This post was inspired by  urlLink asphaire's  Serendipity post.)  When I contemplate the events that conspired to bring hubby and I together, I am forced to believe in destiny and fate. I see God's hand in our union. I see it in every detail.  He was born in a small town in Morocco, in Ouled-Khalif Nord. I was born in a small town in Candelaria, Quezon, Philippines.  Two small towns in different corners of the world and our lives couldn't have been more different and similar at the same time.  I loved my childhood, and he his, however different our childhood was. His was marked with freedom, skipping school, roaming the streets with friends, and getting into trouble. Mine was marked with a laughing family, though an overprotective one that kept me indoors almost all the time in the city. I was allowed some freedom only in Candelaria, where the streets were small and everyone knew me as the Principal's grandaughter.  I was always an obedient girl.  In the Philippines, I watched American movies, wishing I had my own room, wishing I lived in the streets the American people lived in.  In Morocco, he watched American movies and listened to American songs, not understanding the words but enjoying them nonetheless.    He discovered kung fu movies as a young boy, and that is when his love affair with anything Asian began. He kept as his prized possession, a pair of chopsticks and told everyone who would listen that he was going to marry a Chinese girl, preferably one that knew martial arts like the girls from the kung fu movies. He attened martial arts school, eventually earning a black belt in Wu-Shu   Life was hard for him. His parents were humble, a housewife and a teacher. And with three other children in the house, all he could dream about was going to Germany, or France, or the ultimate dream, America. In the meantime, my parents were in Canada, adjusting to the life they chose.  My hubby won the lottery. Not the prize money, but the  urlLink U.S. government lottery  wherein they give 50,000 people around the world the chance to become a permanent resident in the United States. He could hardly believe his luck. His brother, an older, more studious individual, had not been able to win it. He discarded the student visa he had been given for Germany, and turned down an opportunity to remain illegal in France where he lived for a year while awaiting his papers.  America was the land in sight.   He was given a choice between two states, New York and Texas. He could have chosen New York. He wanted to choose New York. That city which have been the setting of countless American movies. He chose Texas, where friends from back home were waiting.   Meanwhile, a health crisis in Toronto, Ontario had forced the nursing unions that my parents belonged to to go on strike. My parents had to go begging their banks for extensions on car and mortgage payments and after a long struggle, they made the choice to answer the call for nurses in Texas. An almost spontaneous decision that brought me and my future husband closer together.  He and I arrived within months of each other.  And still we may never have met.He was bumming around. Working, earning money, going through girls, enjoying his freedom and own hard-earned money. In the meantime, I had been pushed towards a career in medicine and attended Baylor University for a Pre-Dental/Pre-Nursing degree.    I ended up not liking my chosen degree. I wanted to dabble in computers. I left and attended DeVry University after a year, a school which focused on many technical degrees and was also foreign student friendly.  At the same time. he eventually grew tired of his empty relationships, cut off ties with the Moroccans he declared as being backstabbers and went to school.  The year that I attended the same school, he switched degrees and we ended up in the same classroom. It didn't take long for us to notice each other and almost immediately, I knew that being with this man would give me a harmonious life.  No one thought it would work. We had cultural, religion differences. It was always an issue with my parents.  Funny it was never an issue for us.  We are not alike, but instead complemented each other smoothly.  He has the patience that I have long ago listed as a must in the man I would marry. His is a well of patience that will see us through my hard headedness.  I have the consequential, decisive nature that will see us through his deliberate, thoughtful periods.    Last summer, we flew to Morocco, where his mother showed me his prized possession, his chopsticks, and told me stories about him as a boy. They showed me a pic of his face superimposed on a Bruce Lee photo. We walked through his old martial arts school, still training young Bruce Lee wannabes.    Next summer, we hope to go to Philippines, where we can walk through the streets of Candelaria, where I played. Meet my extended family and be told stories about me when I was a little girl.  In the twists and turns of our lives, during those pivotal moments, something pushed us the right way. And I thank God for it.  Happy four years together!

      I'm at home with an ear infection. Dizzy and a little bit nauseous, plenty disoriented so forgive me if this post has typos, grammar mistakes, etc.  This is what I love about America, you go for a doctor's visit and pay $15 (for now, next year it will probably be $25, and after that $35 and after that...never mind).  They see you for 5-10 mins. and then send you away with an appetite suppresant. Ha!  When the doctor said that one of the "drawbacks" of my medicine was that it would suppress my appetite, I could barely contain my glee.  ***  On to the next topic. The 2004 elections.   Maybe its because I'm not caught up in a burgeoning relationship and school anymore, or maybe because I've acquired a sense of civic duty now that I'm getting (aray!) older.  But this is the first presidential elections I'm really paying attention to.   I've been watching the Democratic Party Convention and I'm loving the speeches, the veiled and not-so-veiled insults hurled at the other party, and the cheesy analogies, and self-congratulations. There is not a bigger circus than politics I tell you. I'm awaiting the Republican Party Convention to have a more balanced view of party platforms, but I'm pretty much convinced that Bush is a buffoon and should be ousted from the presidential chair. We'll see though, I could still turn Republican. I'm one of the "swing voters" the Democratic party keeps mentioning. No, not a "swinger" voter, a swing voter, meaning I could still be persuaded either way.   Actually I guess I'm not, cause I can't vote. I'm a Canadian citizen and I'm proud of it eh!  I had a third topic but it deserves to be on a post of its own because it will be about my hubby, that wondeful man of mine.   All I'll say for now is... "how wonderful life is, now you're in the world..."  (Still thinking about Moulin Rouge).

      This past Friday I begged off a Friday night dinner ritual with a friend because I had not spent much time with hubby for the past 2 weeks.  He's been working overtime and then on the weekends, we've had plans with people. So, friday night was just us, and then all saturday.  Nice.  We spent the time watching some flicks:   Bourne Supremacy ...Not as good as the first one. I felt misled by a lot critics praising it and hailing it as the best action-thriller they've seen in years.  I usually tune into  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  and it got very good reviews. Not that it was bad, just not as good as the first one. And I got a headache from some of the camera work. Why are critics often times off the mark from the general public viewer's views?    Moulin Rouge ...Loved it! This is not for every musical fan. But I really loved it. I thought Nicole Kidman was a bit of an odd choice for the role of Satine, in an "against type" kinda way, but it worked. Its a very odd ball kind of movie, but I really enjoyed it.   Girl with a Pearl Earring ...Slow, not a lot of moving and shaking goin on, but I love Scarlett Johannesen (sp?) and Colin Firth. I've loved Mr. Firth since I saw him in Bridget Jone's diary and then after that on BBC's mini-series production of  Pride and Prejucide .     Sweethest Thing ...I think the  idea  behind it was cool. That of showing women on the hunt for a mate instead of the usual men. But it was missing a lot of things. I love Ms. Diaz, but I hate to admit it, she can't carry a movie without a male lead or othe strong female actresses (I'm thinking of Drew Barrymore and the kickass Lucy Liu in the 1st Charlie's Angels).    Aside from being a movie-phile this weekend, I also visited my family on Sunday. We had a Karaoke session to the max! I got to sing Desperado....i sounded better without the  mike  mic.

      For a Filipino like me who remembers what it was like living in the Philippines, I feel extremely lucky to have lived in both Canada and the U.S.  People will tell you, there's no place like home, like the Philippines. And there isn't. The problem is our home has problems absorbing and supporting its citizens, hence the huge numbers of exports in the form of our people.    When I was a little girl, "America" was the golden word and world.  Everything from America that relatives would send seemed to smell so much better.  Everyone from there seemed to have been born with a silver spoon in their mouths. The American lives I saw in the big screen was more polished, more sophisticated, more privileged. All the little girls had their own room, versus the cramped quarters that I lived in. I remember spending my nights, after watching American movies with little girls in it, dreaming about my own room. I imitated their language, picking up lines from the movies that I would drop to impress my friends.  When we found out that we would be moving to Canada, it didn't quite have the same cache as going to "America", but people still spoke English there, and they were still "white".  I was in bliss and I don't really remember going through culture shock or being home sick. I drowned in the multiple channels on TV and Saturday morning cartoons. I quickly got used to their weird un-powdered Nido milk.  I got used to their weird tasting hot dogs. I was highly impressed with our bathtub and the fact that we had hot water!  I made snow angels and snowmen and didn't even feel the cold. In short, I loved it.  I remember my Papa, cooking breakfast for us on our first morning in Canda and we actually had bacon, ham, eggs, fried rice, and orange juice and milk to choose from! What a feast for a girl like me! And when we moved to a new place a couple of months later, I finally got what I wanted for so long, my own room.  A room where I could stay late under the covers reading my books, where I could sulk when I was mad at my Mom, where I could lock my brother out of, where I could put up posters of celebrities that I wanted.   When my parents announced that we were moving to Texas, it was like dropping a bomb on my lap. Once going to a Texas school, and living a Texas life, I thought to myself: now this is more like the movies I had seen.  Cheerleaders and football, the prom, my first serious boyfriend, this all happened when I moved to Texas.  Canadians are cleaner, more polite, but Texas has that Southern charm that makes up for it.  I honestly can say that I love America.  I got so lost in the reverie that I almost forgot to talk about what inspired this post.  That would be the movie In America, where you can see the struggle to assimilate play out, seen through the eyes of a little girl. I highly recommend it. It will strike a chord in anyone, but especially for those for whom America is not their first home.  Here's a haunting song from the movie that I will be singing in Karaoke sessions to come :)   Johnny Cash Lyrics -  Desperado  Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? You been out ridin' fences for so long now. Oh, you're a hard one, But I know that you've got your reasons. These things that are pleasin' you, Can hurt you somehow.  Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy, She'll beat you if she's able. Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet. Now it seems to me, some fine things, Have been laid upon your table. But you only want the things that you can't get.  Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger: Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home. And freedom, oh freedom, Well, that's just some people talkin' Your prison is walking, Through this world all alone.  And don't your feet get cold in the winter time? The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine It's hard to tell the night time from the day You're loosin' all your highs and lows Ain't it funny how the feeling, Goes away?  Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? Come down from your fences, and open the gate It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you, You better let somebody love you, You better let somebody love you, You better let somebody love you, Before it's too late.

      We went for it. We took the plunge. We stopped dreaming about it and actually went for it.   We decided on London. This wasn't a popular choice when I took a poll on a  urlLink previous post .  I chose it because it was the cheapest and my uncle and aunt and adorable cousins are there (see sidebar for pics of family in UK). It has a slightly higher exchange rate (which is abysmal on the dollar) than Paris as well.  I am happy on our choice!  And very excited. I can't seem to stop babbling, planning, daydreaming about our days in London, which won't happen until October, timed to let us save more money, and for more convenience and consideration for my job (which professes to need me during the busy rush of August and September).  We're staying at a not-too-shabby hotel, walking distance to the West End district and close to the British Museum.  Anybody have any tips to make this trip more fun, safe, efficient? I welcome it!  It's London, baby!

      Inspired by  urlLink cia , I decided to revive my food blog. I had one online, that I kept pretty much hidden, and I had 2 posts. That's 2 posts.  I figure if I link the food blog to this one, I'd be more accountable.  Well, we'll see.   The food blog is designed to point out flawed patterns in my eating, the end goal being establishing healthy eating patterns.  Again, we'll see.  ***Edited to Add***  Sorry for the original misleading title. I honestly don't know how to cook well. I know 5 recipes that I recycle. I'll post that if you guys want.:)

      I had a great weekend. Really fun-filled.  Saturday, I went to a friend's to help set up for the surprise birthday party he and I and Classy Edna had coordinated for his wife, Sil.    She was totally suprised and our barbecue chichen wings, hamburgers, hotdogs, and deer sausage didn't turn out too shabby. We had a lot of people who helped warm up the karaoke, the bacyard deck's hard wood floors with our gettin the groove on, and we also  helped irk the neighbor by having a no-rules volleyball game in the backyard (after we had a lil bit of liquor in us...just a lil bit).  Sunday, we headed over to the downtown's Latin Festival, meeting up with the b-day girl herself and her family.  I love these downtown outdoor events!  Here's hubby buying us some chicken fajitas    Sombreros anyone?    Here's some very well done graphics on the side of a car exhibit    This just caught my eye    The happy couple...hubby's chewing on some fajitas there    Our friends' lovely daughter getting ready to climb the wall    She reached the top!    I love my camera. These moments are nice on memory but I really like them preserved to look back on.   I'll post a link to the rest of the pics later when its not so 2 am-ish in the morning. Heh..

      I've been scouring different travel deals on the net. I am on a rampage. My wallet protests but only half-heartedly as my fingers do the surfing.   I'm privileged enough to know that a lot of the people who I exchange blog visits with live in and have traveled in many different countries. And for those who dream of traveling to foreign countries like me, to all of you, what's your choice of financial poison?   Paris, France        Rome, Ital y        London, UK       Malaga, Spain     Let's all dream about it over the weekend shall we?

      After a nice trip to San Diego, I seem to have sunk into the doldrums awaiting the next time that I can pack up my bags and fly off somewhere else. My feet seem to be itching to walk untravelled streets, with foreign street signs, and it taps taps taps impatiently when settling idly under the work desk, the computer desk at home.  My feet want to travel.  I want to travel.  I'm looking at my favorite site for travel deals  urlLink OffPeakTraveler.com  and looking lustily at the deals they're tempting me with. The best thing is that of the 3 countries I want to visit, Spain, England, France, we have relatives we can stay with to offset the cost of hotel rooms. Although I have been thinking it would be nice to have our own hotel room, the relatives with open rooms make the travel more feasible.  Sigh. I really have the wander lust.

      Several months back, I had a post about my  urlLink Netflix account .  I must say that I am enjoying my Netflix membership. With our regular account (which is about $23/month), we average about 3 DVDs a week.  We used to rent our videos from Blockbuster.  That's $4.82 a video x 3(DVDs) x 4(WEEKS)=$57.84=BIG SAVINGS. I urge you all to get a membership if its available in your are. Of course,  others are getting these DVDs and then burning them, but I would NEVER do that, would I? Ahem.  For those who needs some suggestions on what to watch, here is the list from my netflix queue (24 movies in all so far). I would also love some suggestions of what to add, especially for really good foreign films.   Secret Window Cold Mountain Mystic River The Cooler Girl with a Pearl Earring In America Moulin Rouge Secretary The Triplets of Belleville Devdas Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set: Vol. 1 Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set: Vol. 2 Monty Python and the Holy Grail   Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set: Vol. 3 The Man in the Moon The Importance of Being Earnest Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde The Cider House Rules Sex and the City: Season 4: Disc 1   Sex and the City: Season 4: Disc 2   Sex and the City: Season 4: Disc 3

      I spent all of Saturday vegging in front of the television, watching DVDs.  I watched Whale Rider, then Monsters, then 2 Days in the Valley. I can't help thinking that if I had watched 2 Days in the Valley before the other two, I would have enjoyed it more. But the other 2 were so much better and of course, had much more depth to them.   I love Keisha Castle-Hughes, the little girl who played Pai in Whale Rider. What a natural! For those of you who have not seen it, be advised, this is not for the special-effects lovers, nor for the fast-paced, blockbuster type movie goers. But definitely well-worth watching.  As for Monsters, Charlize Theron definitely deserved the Best Actress award she won for this role.   That said, Sunday was a day spent almost entirely in front of my Mom's PC, which suffered when their house got hit by lightning weeks ago. Connecting via their Ethernet cable, they get nada, no response from their ISP provider (They have DSL). Connecting via a USB connection, it is not as fast as they are used to. I spent hours and still couldn't get it to work optimally.  I'm so sick of that PC. And I feel bad for my mom cause she's always having all sorts of PC problems. Oh, well, we'll have another go at it...some other time.  Thanks Mom for treating us to Red Lobster and Chinese food!  It's back to work tomorrow. Yuck!

      If you read my previous post, you'll know that my trip got off to a bumpy start and that I forgot many things, including my digital camera.   It didn't stop me from having fun though! I shopped and ate and visited with family. My face almost got burned from the 4th of July picnic we had. I got very little sleep with all the commotion.  Responding to  urlLink doh's   question, did I get my eat on?  The answer is absolutely YES!  I was craving Jollibee, so for Sunday lunch, right before the 12:30 pm picnic, and while we were supposedly running errands picking up -- what else, more food-- my cousin took my brothers and I to Jollibee and I got my chicken joy on! Our family at the picnic were wondering why we weren't hungry with pansit (noodles), chicken wings, bbq pork, fried rice, dinuguan ( I won't explain this one!), and so many other dishes.  But later on, I did end up nibbling on some of the tasty fare. :)  We also had plenty of Japanese food, with even a Japanese buffet thrown in.  And what did we pack the most of on our trip back?  More food! My mom's pasalubong (gifts for a person) were turon (sweet bananas is the best way I can explain it), sinukmani (sweet) rice), mango cake from Red Ribbon (I bought one for myself and hubby), empanadas, and more jollibee dishes (spaghetti and palabok), and I forgot what else.  Whew, are we a food-loving family or what? Hubby's favorite was the mango cake. It is really very good.  Hubby was the one on my mind the most. I bought mostly things for him when I was there, or else for the house. Here's the stash:   Not bad for less than $100      Japanese tea pot and Japanese bowls, bought from Los Angeles' Mitsuwa      CDs bought from Amoeba Music in L.A.      DVDs and Cologne (CK's Escape)

      Here are some things to do and/or avoid when going on a trip:  1. Do make a list of the things you're going to need when going on a trip. This ensures that anything you need will be cross-referenced and minimizes the chance of you forgetting things.  2. Do NOT, like me, ignore your husband's encouragements to write up that list and as a result forget things. Like your digital camera to capture all the nice moments with your family, a toothbrush, other necessary toiletries, and most important of all, underwear.  3. Do wake up with plenty of time for you to get ready and make sure you have everything ready with you.  4. Do NOT, like me, keep hitting the snooze button so that by  time you finally wake up, your family is knocking on the door ready to go to the airport.  5. When your husband says, "babe, you better drive on the way to the airport cause I don't want to argue about my driving", take the wheels and drive. Or shut your mouth.  6. Do NOT, like me, ask him to drive anyway and then proceed to be a back-seat, or in my case, a passenger driver. At least we didn't part angry and upset.   7. If at all possible, pinpoint the exact gate you're heading to. It will avoid arguments on the way to the airport.  These are just some of the things that went wrong in my departure. I'm back to reality now, but will write more details about my trip later. And oh yea, I missed blogging and reading up on my blog lists!

       What is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for you? Many people have done many nice things for me. Offering coins for the parking meter, buying me a round of drinks. My husband does a lot of his share: cutting up my food into manageable size (like I was a kid), kisses me before he leaves for work,leaves me love notes and checks on me throughout the day. Too many to count!   What's the nicest thing you've done for someone else? I've bought food for colleagues as a treat, I guess.   What one thing do you wish you had done?  I wish I had gone backpacking through Europe during my college days, like my aunt had suggested I do.   What is your biggest regret?   Regret is something I don't allow in myself. I look back and am pretty satisfied with my past decisions and actions and those minor things that didn't go so well, I believe they were opportunities for me to learn.   What is your greatest accomplishment?   Graduating from college magna cum laude!

      It's easy, just take your regular fortune from Fortune Cookies, usually found in Chinese restaurants, and add the all-important  in bed  at the end.   Learning to forgive takes practice...in bed!    A small incident will shortly develop to your advantage...in bed!    Somebody in thankful for the support you have provided...in bed!  (good for you!) And last but not least:  Somebody would do anything for you...in bed!

      Just had a really, really interesting and sleep-deprived weekend. I got a puppy! I'm not going to say "we" got a puppy, because he is mostly my dog, and I seem to be the one going out to take him for a walk all the time. We've only had him for a day, but boy, am I so excited!  He is a salt and pepper Miniature Schnauzer, 13 weeks old and I am keeping myself awake worrying about him (cause he sleeps most of the night).  I felt really guilty about leaving him in his crate today, especially since all the books I read (I did some major cram sessions with puppy books before getting him) say that he shouldn't be left in a crate for longer that 4 hours. Today hubby took a break from lunch to give him water and walk him but he won't be able to do it everyday. Sad. Everyone at work who's had a puppy before and who have dogs, tell me they'll get used to it and that's how they did it. I'm still sad. If only I worked closer to home!  So yeah, this is a majore development. My very first dog! I named him Toby and I will post a picture of him soon.  ***  On that note, I'd like to thank everyone's warm response to my previous post. To answer some questions:  Writing this post just felt really revealing. More revealing than anything I've written before. But I wanted to share my feelings, and wanted to write something as a tribute to my wonderful husband. He read it and appreciated it very much!  We've bene married for less than a year now, our 1 year wedding anniversary being on November 22nd. I would have liked our wedding to have been in August too but it didn't work out that way.  To everybody else, my usual routine is to go through each comment and reply to it, but forgive me. They've piled up without me replying every so often, and I am so sleepy now, even as I write this post. I read every one of them though and wish to thank you all for all the positive responses.  Thank you all. Now, I MUST SLEEP  ***  Coming Soon:  Bedroom Fortunes...finally an update!
