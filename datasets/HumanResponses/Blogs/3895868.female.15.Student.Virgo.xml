       Oh my god.. wad a tiring day today! I almost couldn't get up for school this morning. As usual, I got up for school and headed for school. Same old boring stuff happened in school today.[I'm sure many of u would understand how it feels having boring lessons??!] Lessons today were like...Teachers speaking a different kind of language, causing the losing of interests in what they are talking.?. How can I describe it other than that way?! After school, I even had my E maths peer tutoring until 4.20pm, followed by my Structured Self Study programme til 5.30pm. 
Geex... Imagine more than half of your day gone just like that. I would rather come straight home after school, take a nap and then head on with my assignments and revision. I'm sooo.... unsatisfied with the plans by our school most of the times. However, all I can say is, 'Unfortunately, nothing can be done by me, myself.' Which school has ever expected their students to pay for the worksheets given by the teachers?! This would be the first for me, in my 16 years of life! ..Haix.. Never mind. 
Nevertheless, I hope that everyone else did not go through the same as what I did today. Instead, I hope that u ppl had a great time in school with your pals n all... and not forgetting to have learnt something today! ~cHilL~PeAcE oUt~

       Hmmm... Try having a guess at wad I've done on my Sunday. I did nth but do my homework in front of e computer since noon time. How boring. I'm now typing this as I chose to have a break. I was actually suppose to be out with my family at my grandma's since this mornin. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to wake up that 'early'(errmx.. According to my definition of early..hEhee). 
Sometimes I feel bored to the extend that I could sleep all day! But I'm afraid of putting on more weight man! Enuff weight with me already manx! Need to lose some. Ok.. Cut this crap. I wonder wad does everyone else do on a Sunday if u were to stay at home n do nth else?~ Any suggestions? However, lucky me, I've got some good pals who r willing to chat with me on e phone! Thanks a lot... U Know who u r~ ok.. I'll stop here for today. Update once I've got e time to!

       Another long day it is today. What can i say once again?! Boring? Interesting lessons? Exciting? Geex.. ONCE AGAIN... Boring! Can u imagine havin lessons this boring for one whole year? Well, maybe when you get lucky, you'll have a few interesting ways of learning the topic being taught. If not.. never will get interested manx. However, its still up to oneself to pay attention or not. Okx.. Cut the school stuff. 

Hmm.. May I know what do you all understand by the term 'life'? Or wad do u learn in life? I always wonder that. Okx.. Nevermind. I'm super tired already. Me going to take a shower n head for my assignments nanx! ~chIlL~

Thanks to the diahorea, vomiting, dizziness I had this morning! &amp; u bet that it's in the morning! wad's 1 am manx! Spoilt my sleep. I only slept for 3 hrs to be exact! ~Geex~ I went to the clinic so early in the morning n the doc said that I had Irritable Bowel Syndrome &amp; hypermobility syndrome! *pEnGsS* Also dun really get wad he was talkin about. Then i was sent to the hospital for X-ray. WaH.. Killed so many of my CELLS! ~Poor cells of mine~ The doc said that I need high fibre diet and high iron diet. Wow! Don't I eat enough yet?! ~Look at me~ *bLuR-Blur* HehEex. 
My advice to everyone out there, 'Do not have irregular meals and do not be too flexible'. Hahax.. Go check the website out on 'Hypermobility syndrome' &amp; 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome'.. You'll get wad I really mean. ~It's *torturing*~ Hmmm.. I wonder what everyone else is doing in sch today? If anyone care to drop a clue, pls drop it under comments. Hahax.. Thanks. Arhhh!!! Common test 2 coming! Aint anyone afraid at all?! Maybe not. Everyone's so smart and all.. Other than me. Haix.. No wonder I'm afraid. Okx.. Dop this subject manx! Doc said I'm too stressed up already. Hahahahax.. for once ppl say I'm stressed up.[I mean over studies]Lol. Too playful already manx. Nevermind, I'll try to be more hardworking and determine all the way til O's from now on. [*gEeExX* I wonder if I mean that at all] Okx.. At least I get to complain about some things here again. Wahahaha.. ~CompLaIn qUeEn~ PeAcE!!

       &nbsp;  Hey.. it's been quite some time ya?! School once again! Arghh~ pissing me off manx~ All those lecturing by teachers and all those reminders that O's is around the corner, manx! You'll so feel like strangling the teachers at times ya?!! However, you'll stil need them to stay alive to teach ya til after ur O's, so.. let's just keep them alive for a lil while longer. Geex~ So stressing lei! As those freakin school days pass by like that, I feel as though I'm getting lesser and lesser air to breathe day by day.&nbsp;Never have I thought that studying would be so DAMN tough! I'm still struggling to hang onto the rope that the teachers are leading. I'm sure you know what that means. Especially for anything to do with math and science. Gosh~ How I wish these two subjects does not exist. Errrmxx.. I was so stressed today especially during my E math period today. I do not realli haf any clue why, but I do know that it's partly because of all the teachers trying to rush like a 'bullet train' in the topics they're teaching. Oh manx~ I'm trying real hard manx. I know my results sucks. [And that's also why I'm in S.S.S] But to me, it's really a waste of time you know! I'd rather come home and study and revise on my own and I can even call for help at times. Not like in school. I don't really know why but it seems like i have more mood to study at home than in school. [Don't ask me why!] It's just that I'm lazy in nature, like a pig! Heheee~ Hmmm... By the way, Racial Harmony Day is coming. Hope to see many people in their different yet own unique and original traditional costumes! Hahahax. Happy Racial Harmony Day! [In advance]

       Yo!  Sup' ! Hmm.. Happy Racial Harmony Day! Today's the actual day indeed. I went to Aishah's house early in the morning to get changed into her malay traditional clothe. Geex! I realli\y, seriously felt weird weraing that the whole day ok! Also dunno what made me do it. Maybe because of the fact that  MY WHOLE CLASS IS WEARING TRADITIONAL   COSTUMES . First time in my  10 yrs  of education, a whole class does that manx. ~ CoOliO ~ Errmxx... And as usual, everybody did not have  THE MOOD  to study today. Everyone seems to be on a 'I want to take photos' kind of mood. It's kinda funny when u come to think of it. Hmmm.. school was actually kind of boring but fun at the same time. I also have no idea of what I'm sayin.  Gosh ~ It's my third day today not going for  TRIPLE S PROGRAMME ! I'm so  dead  manx! I dun have a clue why I've been feeling&nbsp; weak  the&nbsp;past few days. And it's already been more than a week, ever&nbsp;since I went to see the doc. Therefore, always after school hours, I feel as though it's time for me to head home for  rest,  as my body dun seem to be able to take it anymore. However, I think that the teachers will think that it's an  excuse . That's the very  problem  with teachers nowadays. When you tell them thr truth, they dun believe you. When you lie to them, instead they will tend to believe you more than the truth. Ain't it  weird  at all?!! Okx.. Cut this crap. Hmmm.. During school hours today, everyone in their traditional costumes were shinin  bright  ya~ In other words, everyone look pretty and handsome in their traditional costumes. Oh  yeah ! Today, once again, right after english peer tutoring, I went to have lunch and went straight home. ~ Home Sweet Home ~ After coming back home to wash up and tidy the house, the interested buyers came to my house to view. Wondered how it went as I didn't bother about the adults' conversations. Not long after, 'wx da ge', joan jie' and 'ct da ge' came to my house to study.  Geex~  In fact, the motive is more of allowing me to ask them as many doubts I have as possible. And I very well  thank  them for that.  Sorry  that I might have to trouble you guys again ya?! And THANKS once again!

        SuP '! What a tiring day though I didn't go to school  again .&nbsp;School's having 'career seminar' for the sec 4s and there wouldn't be lessons, therefore I decided not to go to school. Plus I felt lazy and tired in the morning, that's another reason why. Okxokx, let's just drop this subject. I was at home cleaning the  whole house  after i've had my breakfast[ or u might call that lunch ].  Geex ~ With the back problem, I definitely had a hard time. ~  Oh well ~ What's done is done.&nbsp; Oh yeah ! joan's coming my house later to study. Dunno about changtat and joan's  boyfren .  HeeHee ! Hmm.. I wonder how did the  seminar  go for all my classmates and schoolmates.* thinking *&nbsp;Should have at least  inspired  them to go to a certain course I think! Hahax. As for the  physics peer tutoring  after that?!! Hmmm.. That should be a lil worse huh?!  Buttttttt , for the sake of our  O's , we still have to hang on. Lol... Although I'm not there la. HehE. Ermmx... As long as I&nbsp;pray for&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;to be able to&nbsp; score  very well for their O's with  flying colours ! As for myself, I  'double pray' ! Hehehe. ~PeAcE oUt~

It's like I knew nothing about wad alpha, beta, gamma thingy that mrs cheoh was talking about just now during her lesson lor. GeeX~ I simply felt like fainting on the spot manx.

HAIX~ I seriously have no idea why some ppl just dun like being more direct and would rather go ard ppl's back. Kinda weird. Oh well~ Since they dun wish to heed the advice of being more direct, they will soon regret i guess.
