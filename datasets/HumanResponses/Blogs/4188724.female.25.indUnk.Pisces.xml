      By the way - today I attended Mass at St. Anne's for the second time.  I really believe that part of God's plan in having us move here was to lead us to this parish!  It's wonderful - I came home filled with joy and I've been singing 'Salve Regina' all day long. So much more inspiring than "Here I am, Lord" and "Taste and See" accompanied by acoustic guitar, like at St. Boniface.  St. Anne's has an organ, and listening to it makes my heart soar.  Music nourishes my soul so much, but the music m old parish just made me feel embarrassed for the people responsible.  And it was so wonderful to hear a homily that had substance and didn't include any dissent!  At Blessed Sacrament, the homilies always included some veiled reference to the Church's "unenlightened" stance on homosexuality, divorce, other religions, women's ordination etc. and St. Boniface's pastor tried so hard to offend no one he ended up saying nothing at all.  At St. Anne's I found myself much better able to lift my mind and heart out of the humdrum and focus on Christ in the Eucharist.  All day I have felt the Holy Spirit guiding me.  Why can't every Catholic parish be like this? Maybe they can't afford an organ, but it's the spirit of reverence and the faithfulness to the Magisterium that really makes the difference.

      More from Lavinia the ex-nun, on the new Vatican document about feminism:  Dr Lavinia Byrne, a theologian whose books include Woman at the Altar and Women Before God, said: "This is based on the false premise that feminism aspires to take out gender differences when it is about securing access to the same rights for women as for men.   "The issues raises valid questions, but the debate should not be conducted by lone, celibate men pontificating."   Byrne also queried why the report appeared to link feminism with homosexuality. "Why is that bit of agenda being brought into question? It is as though they are saying all feminists are dykes."   Boy, I'd love to meet Dr. Lavinia.  Really. Apparently, she is the international spokeswoman for feminism - hence, she is able to inform us that feminism does not "aspire to take out gender differences".  I guess that depends, Doc - out of what? Out of women and men?  It seems most feminists today hold that these differences are not inherent, but imposed by culture.  Out of the culture?  On the contrary, this is exactly what feminism attempts to do.  Officially, some may give lip service to the idea that women should be able to take on any role they wish, including traditional roles, the reality is that inevitably, a society that considers full time work outside the home an acceptable option for mothers of young children  will not  value the contribution of a stay at home mother.   The two are mutually exclusive.  People cannot simultaneously believe that "it is important for children to have their mother care for them at home" and "it is acceptable for a mother to choose not to care for her children at home". As far as "lone, celibate men pontificating", I wonder whether Lavinia would apply this to Jesus Christ?  I suppose his teachings are irrelevant, since he is a "lone, celibate men pontificating"?  Or perhaps she's a fan of "The DaVinci Code"! :) I'm sorry, but those lone, celibate men are the successors of the Apostles and therefore, precisely the right people to 'conduct the debate' - and, for what it's worth, here's one married woman weighing in on their side! And on to the "dyke" issue:  given that feminists believe that women should have access to the same rights as men, presumably this would include the right to marry a woman"  Actually, the connection is quite clear.  If feminists believe that differences between men and women limit women's options and therefore, should be abolished as much as possible, then they probably see no reason homosexuality would be morally any different from heterosexuality, since men and women would be basically the same and therefore, interchangeable.   And besides, most feminists are dykes! :) Just kidding!

      I swear, when I wrote my post yesterday I was completely unaware that the Vatican had just recently released this document: "On the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World"  urlLink http://www.wf-f.org/CDF-LetteronCollaboration.html  excerpt: "From the first moment of their creation, man and woman are distinct, and will remain so for all eternity. Placed within Christ's Paschal mystery, they no longer see their difference as a source of discord to be overcome by denial or eradication, but rather as the possibility for collaboration, to be cultivated with mutual respect for their difference. From here, new perspectives open up for a deeper understanding of the dignity of women and their role in human society and in the Church." and "Among the fundamental values linked to women's actual lives is what has been called a "capacity for the other". Although a certain type of feminist rhetoric makes demands "for ourselves", women preserve the deep intuition of the goodness in their lives of those actions which elicit life, and contribute to the growth and protection of the other.  This intuition is linked to women's physical capacity to give life. Whether lived out or remaining potential, this capacity is a reality that structures the female personality in a profound way. It allows her to acquire maturity very quickly, and gives a sense of the seriousness of life and of its responsibilities. A sense and a respect for what is concrete develop in her, opposed to abstractions which are so often fatal for the existence of individuals and society. It is women, in the end, who even in very desperate situations, as attested by history past and present, possess a singular capacity to persevere in adversity, to keep life going even in extreme situations, to hold tenaciously to the future, and finally to remember with tears the value of every human life." "Indeed, a just valuing of the work of women within the family is required. In this way, women who freely desire will be able to devote the totality of their time to the work of the household without being stigmatized by society or penalized financially, while those who wish also to engage in other work may be able to do so with an appropriate work-schedule, and not have to choose between relinquishing their family life or enduring continual stress, with negative consequences for one's own equilibrium and the harmony of the family. As John Paul II has written, "it will redound to the credit of society to make it possible for a mother ­ without inhibiting her freedom, without psychological or practical discrimination and without penalizing her as compared with other women ­ to devote herself to taking care of her children and educating them in accordance with their needs, which vary with age"." Beautiful.  It's a shame that so much of the reaction is negative:  urlLink http://www.iht.com/articles/532304.html  "It's just more water under the bridge," said Lavinia Byrne, religious commentator and former nun who left the cloth in 1998 after writing a book on the issue of ordination of women as priests. She said the Vatican for years had been clarifying the role of women in the church with few major results. . "We are being treated as a problem that must be addressed rather than a solution that could be brought into the church," she added. . She objected that women were not being urged to be more proactive and wondered why the church never wrote pamphlets addressed to men "suggesting what they can and can't do."" I wonder if Lavinia even read the document, or simply skimmed it to see if they were ordaining women yet?  The push for women's ordination is so ridiculous.  If these ladies would stop trying to be priests and start trying to be  saints , the Church would see a "springtime" beyond our wildest dreams.  The real motivation for most of them is, I suspect, the belief that women priests would liberalize Catholic doctrine, especially on un-PC issues like birth control and homosexuality.  God forbid.  (not to worry - He has!) When I was first considering Catholicism a few years ago, the Church's position on birth control bothered me too, but I decided to keep an open mind and try to find out  why  the Church taught as She did.  I prayed for understanding, and I developed an intuitive sense of the sinfulness of artificial birth control.  Why can't most people approach Catholicism with the same open mindedness and suspension of judgment they afford "alternative" beliefs like Tibetan Buddhism, Feng Shui and Wicca?  These are full of ideas far stranger than any in Catholicism, yet hip liberals entertain the possibility that they are true.

      Trying to get the kids to watch less TV.  So we've been killing time with alternative activities & having fun.  The other day we planted a rhododendron & made a batch of play dough (flour, salt, water and canola oil), I've been reading stories, encouraging them to draw, etc.  We had fun making crowns out of willow and being 'water princesses'. Ella says her own name! However, I think "ah-laaa" is a normal 5-week-old sound - it's cute, anyhow. Awww. She just smiled in her sleep. Duane has been very patient, considering the stress he's under.  They closed the group home he worked in, so he's looking for a new job, and we just moved into a new house where his office has no door (he's also a writer) so the kids go in there and bug him.  My dad's helping me put a door on tomorrow -  feeling a bit guilty about working on a Sunday, though.  I wish I could ask a priest if it's OK - it's not paid work, after all.

      Ok, wrote this long rant about feminism, and it disappeared. I'll try my best to remember what I said -  I was talking about modesty, about how I don't like to wear pants because, besides being uncomfortable (they chafe my thighs and slide down in back when I sit), they have come to symbolize for me the rejection of femininity I see all around me.  By rejection of femininity I mean the idea that traditional feminine roles (mother, homemaker, teacher, nurse etc.) are degrading and unimportant, that commonly feminine behaviors and traits (nurturing, peacekeeping, caregiving, empathy, cooperation) are pathological repression rather than virtue, and the general attitude that the best thing a woman can be is 'strong and independant'.  Why do we give boyish names to little girls? Why do we act as though controlling one's anger is healthy for a man but unhealthy for a woman? Why do we see pregnancy and breastfeeding as 'tying us down' rather than reveling in our closer bond with our children and the importance of our role as mothers? Why is pop psychology constantly encouraging women to be more selfish, seeing our greater concern for the well being of others as a weakness rather than a strength? I, for one, am tired of it. What the world needs most of all right now is feminine women - women who aren't afraid to love, to give, to beautify the world, strengthen relationships and bring depth and meaning into life again. A culture that doesn't value the essential work of caring for and educating children, caring for the sick and elderly, and turning a house into a home is a culture which has become uncivilized in the truest sense. If women filling traditional roles were only valued and respected, I don't doubt most women would choose those roles for themselves - for women truly are different from men, and those differences should be celebrated. Sure, some women will prefer more 'masculine' careers, but this should be seen as their personal preference, not as sign of being superior, more modern or more intellegent - because this implies men are superior to or more intellegent than women. True feminism, rather than encouraging women to be like men in the name of 'equality', should encourage them to be proud of their femininity.  Just my humble opinion - now off to shop for skirts!

      Ok, yesterday I was under incredible stress and managed to stay calm, and then today I have been a complete ogre from the minute I woke up.  First I raged at Duane because I had to chase the kids around the house the second I woke up (even before getting dressed) and then I took the girls outside and ended up flipping out just because Tara scattered the flowerpots all over the yard and wouldn't pick them up the first time I asked.  (Ella was crying and I wanted to bring her in the house) there's no excuse for what I said to Tara.   I wonder whether the concept of 'abuse' isn't counter-productive.  If I do something (like yelling an insult) that I feel crosses the line into 'abuse', I basically stop trying to control myself at all because I feel like it doesn't matter anymore, I already blew it. So I end up doing even worse things. Or when I define someone else's treatment of me as 'abuse' I stop listening or caring what they say, even if they have a legitimate complaint, because of the way they say it.  It's like lumping all illegal drugs together "drugs are bad, drugs kill, say no to drugs" can backfire - teens end up saying "well, I smoked pot and it didn't hurt me, so why not try crack?"

      Took Ella to the doctor today.  She's just getting over pertussis, which I caught a week before she was born and gave her as a birthday present.  Apparently, my own pertussis vaccine wore off. I can' help but wonder - if I had not been vaccinated and had had pertussis as I child, would the immunity have lasted, preventing this? I was afraid she was going to die.  I never knew anyone with pertussis, and the unknown is often frightening - the only person who wasn't too worried was my 80 year old grandmother.  "I've seen lots of babies with whooping cough, and I've never heard of anyone dying from it." - of course, she remembers a time before the vaccine was invented. (I wonder if I will be saying this to my grandaughter about chickenpox someday?) Ella's doing fine now. I can't help but notice that once a new vaccine is inrroduced, the pharmaceutical industry's propaganda machine springs into action, making people fear what was previously considered no big deal.  Consider the chickenpox ad with the crying teddy bear, informing us children die from complications of chickenpox.  It's rather nauseating to someone who's aware that  more children die from vaccine reactions . I'm not entirely anti-vaccine.  I am opposed to forced vaccination, like we have in New York State - no philosophical exemptions.  I'm opposed to vaccinating when the risk of the vaccine is worse than the risk from the disease.  I'm opposed to vaccinating newborns against Hepatitis B, which is mostly sexually transmitted.  Babies die from the HepB vax.  My pediatrician admitted today that newborns get HepB shots because "the group most at risk is unlikely to see a doctor" - in other words, we're killing innocent newborns so that promiscuous adults can be protected from the consequences of their own irresponsibility.   Actually, that's very similar to most abortions - killing innocent unborn humans so that promiscuous adults can be protected from the consequences of their own irresponsibility. Age discrimination is what it is. Another example would be neonatal circumcision to "prevent AIDS and STD's" - maiming infants and risking their lives, again to protect promiscuous adults from the consequences of their own irresponsibility. Of course, that seems very important in a culture which believes life is not worth living if one cannot give in to every sexual impulse.  (After all, then one would be repressed!)

      I can just hear Becky... "you can't overcome your faults - you have to put your faith in Jesus and he will overcome them!" :)

      It's 4 am.  Now I'm beginning to get sleepy around the edges, but Ella needs to nurse, so (yes, I can breastfeed whilst typing - yes, that probobly does make me a neglectful mother) I wonder what it is that is so irritating about that certain type of 'non-denominational' Evangelical protestants.   I know a few, and they all seem to exude self-satisfied smugness.   There is something very obnoxious about it.  My friend Becky, for instance -  I feel uncomfortable telling her about any of my problems, since it is quite clear that she believes they are all due to my Catholicism.   There is really no way to debate with these people - if the fact that the canon of scripture was defined by the Catholic church doesn't disturb them, they are beyond the reach of reason.  They seem to believe that a true Christian will not suffer on this earth - that s/he will have a perfect life, no misfortune, no mistakes, no sins, once they 'are saved' - of course this contradicts the teachings of Christ, but hey, some old testament verses can be used to back it up,  so why not? The fact that I suffer doesn't disturb me - after all, Jesus basically *promised* us suffering - it's my inability to overcome my own faults that really upsets me. Though maybe I am overcoming them, slowly.  Maybe I'm not as bad as I used to be.  Maybe the problem is that I keep thinking someday I'll wake up and suddenly be 'perfect' from that day forward.   Unrealistic - a leftover from my yoga days, meditating and expecing to be suddenly 'enlightened' once and for all.
