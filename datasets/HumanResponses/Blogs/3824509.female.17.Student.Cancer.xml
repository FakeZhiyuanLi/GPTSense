      Ok so I know I haven't written in a couple of days but we are having sky lights put in this room. So even as we speak I am buried in furniture, plastic, and nails all to get to the wonderful computer. Fun stuff let me tell ya! i also discovered I have an amazing ablity to sleep through people putting a roof on. Personally I think that is amazing. You know I wouldn't have slept that late but I have had issues going to sleep. I didn't fall asleep till like 5 am. Maybe something is wrong with me. Speaking of having something wrong with me I had to get a MRI today of that was fun.....NOT, that thing scaried the crap out of me. I know feel really sick. Think it is all the radiation? lol But there is a good point today! I just found out I get to go to a Hilary Duff concert. I know people don't like her but thats ok. Since she is my twin *hehe* I have to see her! lol Ya I know I am a dork. But that is just me love it or leave it!

        Well I went to the doctor today that was a HUGE disappointment. My vision is going WAH!!! It's ok though because I can still play sports which is all that really matters. I also discovered today that no matter how hard you try you will end up having a klutsy moment. hehe I also went bowling today which is where is occurred * hey Bri remember that place we went bowling when you came up? That where&nbsp;I went lol* I was winning in the game and all&nbsp;I needed was 2 pins win the entire thing. Right? So what does moron do? Throw two gutter balls in a row! What are the chances of that? I had yet to get a gutter ball too! But oh well.&nbsp; You not what else I learned? No matter how hard you try people will still drift away and find better people than you. However as long as you have at least one true friend it all is good! well to you people I saw MUAH

Had the family over and all that good stuff so it was fun.. got alot of swimming done. Then my great big " finale" was on the 20th. Guess where I got to go? NYC! Oh it was soo much fun! I got to see the play Chicago, and let me tell you the movie has nothing on the broadway play. Paige Davis did an awsome role as Roxie Hart and the person who played Velma blew me away. I feel bad I can't remember her name, but she was really good. We stayed there for 5 days it was a mucho enjoyable trip. I found out it was a very friendly place. So many people kept hitting on me.....yea I could learn to deal with that! My sister is over right now it was her birthday on the 22 so since&nbsp; me and my dad were gone we are celebrating it right now! Yeah the nieces are over and they love me so much! haha Whenever you need a lift just call them. They could make the devil happy! haha I think thats about that minus some more great news! My OH so wonderful loverly beautiful burnette with the gorgous curly locks of hair * that a mouth full* is coming to see me!!! If you don't know who I am talking about let me tell you...its Brianna!!!!! O&nbsp;I love her so much! She is my sun! lol ok i'll stop now. I think that is about it. For all you people in South Carolina that care I come home in 13 days! Well MUCH LOVE!

      I have decided I am way to emotional. The littlest things get to me. I mourn over something that most people would not even have a second thought about. SO I have decided from now on I will NOT get emotional and just let life take me where it wants to. But anyway life is more complicated then needed. Good news is I think I finally found someone I can trust and that makes life all the better.Nice to know you have somthing real to depend on. Hmmm but on to not being so serious. I went fishing and caught 2 fish! :) I also finally finished lifeguard......But yeah just got yelled at so I'm done here. Sometimes I wonder why I am even here

      OH man the 5th of July was fun * our 4th got rained out* me and my wonderful nieces watched fireworks! O more good news I test Thursday for my lifeguard license so wish me luck! I as so tired. I was up till around 1 in the morning trying to convince my friend that we should still hang out. How odd is that? I mean she already goes off and says all this shit about me and how I am a bitching catholic and stuff like that. I'm about to give up. I mean why should I fight when she obviously wants nothing to do with me? I really don't want to lose a great friend but if they don't want you what are you to do? Nothing I guess...Well I am depressed now so I'm going to go take a nap or something.

      Well these last two days were loads of fun! Relatives for two days solid....I spent the night with my Aunt Wendy which was a lot of fun. I kept beating my cousin Josh at video games and he got sooo mad at me. I enjoyed it though. It was somewhat bad though I could not sleep that night. I don't know what it was I just kept thinking of a certain person.....But yeah. The next day I saw my grandma which was good because I haven't seen her in forever! Nothing much besides that...Oh I split all my Italian left overs on my jeans.....red sauce. I was mad it looked like someone died in the driveway. Speaking of dyeing I almost died coming home! It was pouring rain and I couldn't see a foot in front of me. Then some lady just ran into my lane....Yeah I almost died. hahah But anyway HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!

      Well not much is really going on here. I'm up in Wisconsin visiting my dad. So far the summer has been really hectic yet dull at the same time. My dad had to have eye surgery and has been out of work for a month now. He can't drive either so I have been dragging him around every where but its cool. My sister had her baby on the 28th a lil baby girl named Lily Claire. She is the cutest thing in the world! Geri I think is finally rid of her cancer which is the best news ever! Nothing much besides that just getting my lifegaurding licence...I know this is really boring but once stuff happens I will make sure to tell you...I will write more later I don't feel like pouring my heart out right now!

      Sorry I haven't written latley I wrote this HUGE thing then I went to post it and some dumb thing came up and killed the computer! I was so mad! But its all good as long as it doesn't do it again! Hmm what else has happened? I found out Brianna can't come up! HOW SAD IS THAT? But we do get to see each other later in the school year so that is a wonderful thing! I can see my cutie. : ) hmm  what a great thought. I'm missing a week of swim while I am uhere which is somewhat depressing. However I do get to come home on Sunday. I  really  want to come home but I also want to stay here. If  I go home I have to get use to the normal way of life where I have to do chores, get a job, go to school, have people you think are your friends yell at you, but there are good points so I'm thinking about those! I hope senior is great and goes by fast! Then I can move! lol Yea I think I will stop whinning. Oh me and Chrissy spent they day together....its amazing how much family has in common! Yeah it was fun we ended up malesting ice cream cones and accidentally taking out little kids with drumsticks. : / haha It was funny thou! Think that is about it spent two days with both of my grandma's that was fun.....It's also nice to know that your cousins still hate you and probably always will.... Hmmm yeah thats its! BYE
