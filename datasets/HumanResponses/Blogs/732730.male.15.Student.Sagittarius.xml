      Woah... I did a Google search for  urlLink seven fateful search terms . Result 3:  urlLink Tanya's old blog . I was reading back a bit, and WOW! I totally forgot about that. Heh, a lot of people hated me. Well, they mostly still do. I guess it's because of the whole "WOW ADAMS A HOMO OH NOES!!!1111111111111!!!omgomg!!!!1".   Heh, from a comment: "[We don't like Adam] Cause he's a fuckin smartass, and he's gay". Lovely, no? I'm shocked at the feverity (sp?) of what happened there. People were going at it like rabid... Err... Boys :P  Geez. And they're still not over themselves!

         If you guessed gay, you were right. Clearly, he just screams "HOMO!"

      Ok, too lazy to post, yes.  I got to Brisbane on Thursday at 8am (yes, thats right, I left at 6. Yes, I got up at 4). I was tired. We went to Redcliffe for brekky. We all had bacon and egg toasted sandwiches. They were eaten looking out over the ocean. It was quite cold.   We drove around for a while, with no particular purpose. We were on time to my appointment, but we had to wait around for an hour and a half. We went in and I said there were no problems. He checked my back, said I was inflexible and 5 minutes later we left.  "To the Gold Coast" I yelled. Well, I would've yelled that if I wasn't so tired. We drove down the M1 in peak hour traffic. Can you think of anything more fun to do after being up since 4am? We obviously couldn't. On the way down, we drove past Kieran's school. I didn't see him. That could have been because it was 5:30pm.  We checked into our room at the  urlLink Imperial Surf . We were in 19E. It was on the 19th floor. What a surprise. The view from the balcony was teriffic. The room was shit, though. It looked like it hadn't been painted since it was built (in the 70s!). Mum and Dad's blanket smelt like sex and marajuana. Not that I'd know what that smelt like, mind you.   On friday, we went to  urlLink Movie World . It was great! The first ride we went on was the Wild Wild West ride. I got quite wet. I was cold. Then we went to the Police Academy stunt show. It was very funny. I laughed lots. And I ate pop corn. We went on the Bat Man ride... It was average, but good for a laugh. Bat Woman can't drive for shit.  BAHA Then we went on the Scooby Doo ride. It was GREAT! Unexpected stuff though, like a big backwards freefall and sharp corners and stuff. We ate, went on some rides again (and stuff).   My parents convinced me to go on a roller coaster at Loony Tunes land. It was small, but fast! And fun. They said because I enjoyed it so much I should go on Lethal Weapon (I was terrified of it!). I did. After being stuck in line with my mum behind me so I couldn't escape, I got on. The ride up the first hill thing is the worst. Just the thought of the big drop. And I let people know I was scared of that... I was cussin heaps! Then it started... Whoosh. SO MUCH FUN! I loved it. So I went on it three more times. Go me!  That night I was set to meet Kieran after work. After 15 minutes of searching, we finally found each other. We got talking and then his mum rang and said "Come home". It was only 10pm, so meh! I only got fucking half an hour with my boyfriend. GUESS WHO'S NOT HAPPY?! But oh my god, he is soooo fine! I was gonna get a photo, but I forgot to buy a disposable camera. Damn!  The next day I went to Byron Bay (again with my parents). At Byron, there are soooo many hot guys! It's not fair...! We had fish n chips at the beach, whilst being harassed by a flock of seagulls. I wanted to kick them. They flew away.  I was supposed to meet Kieran again, but he said he mum isn't letting him out because he was home late last night. I was pissed off.   On Sunday, not much happened. We drove back to Brissy and did not much in the hotel room. We were staying in a Penthouse room at the  urlLink Novotel Brisbane . The room was really nice, and there was a Playstation 2 in there. But you  had to pay for it. Consequently, I didn't (play, that is).  I was up until midnight talking to Kieran. I really dig that boy.  We left the next morning at 1235. Yay.  Home by 3:30.

      Ok, so I'm posting from the Virgin Blue Blue Room (woo, I said blue twice in a row ;) at Brissy airport. I gotta go in like... 3 minutes coz we're boarding soon, but as soon as I get back home I'm posting. I have some interesting news, too (not really).  But, I did see Kieran even if it was only for half an hour, but it was still good. I say he's pretty fine, so it's all good. I would have seen him for longer if it wasn't for his god damn mother! GRRR!  We went to Movie World, too. Was great fun. I became a roller coaster addict... Woo!  And um, yeah. More in about three hours (when I get back to Cairns!)

       Do you, pole smoker, take this, pole smoker  So the Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court upheld a ruling today that gays should have the right to marry in the state of Massachusetts. This will of course lead to many a heated moments as the beer swilling Catholics in downtown Boston get liquored up and decide to voice their opinions to those who may strike them as light in the loafers, I'm sure. I had actually intended on doing a blurb on this subject about a month ago and it slipped my mind, until I received this email last week... I live in Indiana, and in the past week or so i have been hearing a lot of talk on the radio about same sex marragies becoming legal. Just hearing that makes my stomach drop. Could you lift my spirits for me by doing a little old fasion gay bashing? Well not really bash them, that could cause a lot of trouble, just tease them a little. It would put a smile on my face. Thanks a lot! long time viewer- Mike  Now a few years ago I used to live with a girl who had not only a spectacular pair of breasts, but a gay sister as well. I dunno if the gay sister had great boobs too because, well, she was gay. But anyway, this sister lived in California with her -- of what's the politically correct term -- life partner? Yeah, so these two lesbians have been with each other for a like eleven years and they were as committed to each other as any heterosexual couple I know. But since they obviously can't have any children without some help, they decided one of them gets artificially inseminated. They took a look at their jobs, and decided the one who had the lesser paying job would be the one to carry the baby, since her taking time off from work wouldn't be as financially straining. Nine months later, poof they've got a kid.  The first thing that struck me as a little unfair is only my girlfriend's sister -- the one who actually carried the baby -- could be listed on the birth certificate as the parent. Granted even if they could they'd either have to play paper-scissors-rock to see who gets listed as the father, but still it struck me as a little unfair that only one of them was legally allowed to be recognized as a parent. I mean hey, ya wait around for that long putting up with world class bitchiness beyond belief, you're gonna want some public recognition, right?  The next quirk they came across was health insurance. As it so happened, the birth mother's health insurance coverage was not as robust as the her partner's insurance. You know how that goes, better job and all that, right? Well the baby's medical coverage could not be claimed against this better policy for obvious reasons -- she wasn't legally the child's parent. So this ended up costing them a lot of money out of pocket for medical expenses, and there were even some areas where the child didn't get the same level of care as she could have if she had been covered under the better insurance policy. Again, it seemed unfair not only to the parents financially, but to the baby in regards to her health care.  And suppose for the sake of argument, that while the three of them were driving home from the hospital, there was a car accident and the birth mom was rendered brain dead. If it were a husband and wife deal, the surviving spouse would have legal control over medical treatment (or ceasing of it) for their injured partner, plus have no problem securing sole custody of the baby. But in this case, the surviving lezbo would have no legal recourse despite having just as much time and energy invested as a male partner would.  All these issues because same sex marriages are currently illegal. Okay. So let me think for a minute, that if they were legal, how would they effect my life. Would I have to pay more taxes? No. Would married gay people get a special check out line at the supermarket to get through line faster than me? No. Do they get their own special lane to avoid traffic jams? No. Do they get cheaper car insurance? No. Free car? No. Free socks? No.  So my question would be... what the fuck do I care if gay people want to be married?  They're not fighting to have two guys dressed in wedding gowns, mascara and five o'clock shadows to prance down the aisle of your local church. They're not fighting for the right to fuck on the crosstown bus. They're not fighting to have Hers-and-Hers bathrooms at the mall. All the benefits and rights they're fighting for, wouldn't impact my life one bit if they did get them, so why the hell would I oppose it? It's like going out and saying you oppose blue socks. You can't see em anyway, so who the fuck cares?  The only people that could possibly have a valid argument against anti-same sex marriages are the religious groups. "Homosexuality is an abomination!" they say. Well, okay, that's your take on it that's cool. Fair enough. But then there's two things to consider when you enter that realm, too. One, where the hell were you when priests were treating eight year old children like fuck toys? I didn't hear you say too much then, in fact you kind of looked at your shoes, mumbled something about out of court settlements, and then wandered off into the crowds. I don't hear you protest when atheists get married. I don't hear you protest when atheists get married in a church. I don't hear you protest when religious people get married on a cruise ship snot hanging drunk after grabbing the nearest vacationer to serve as their witness. So please, if you're going to get all high and fucking mighty, at least have the courtesy to do it evenly across the board.  And secondly, this situation my friend, is a perfect example of the REAL reason behind the separation of Church and State. It's not just a springboard for some loudmouthed asshole to use and get his name in the paper when he wants to talk about the Pledge of Allegiance, but instead a genuine reason why Judge Judy needs to leave her Bible/Koran/Torah/Whatever at home.  What if I created a religion where marriage was illegal altogether, would the government have to rule all marriages null and void? What if all the 43,000 people in the United Kingdom who checked their religion as "Jedi" all decided they're never going to get laid and decided they could marry their dog? Would governments then have to recognize those marriages? The answer is no in both cases, because the whole purpose of the separation of Church and State is Uncle Sam can't pick and choose what religious movements they're going to acknowledge and which they aren't. Churchgoers have every right in the world to voice their opinions in a public forum, but when it comes time to making laws it's time to have a nice tall glass of Shut-The-Fuck-Up. The only thing Uncle Sam can do is to make sure everyone, man, woman, black, white, tall, short, cute, ugly, straight or gay, gets a fair shake.

      I've almost finished my new layout. It's interesting, to say the least. It's full CSS, so no more Terrible Tables (tm). So... Um, yer. It'll be on soon-ish. Sana would say "I don't like it Adam, it looks too pro!". Ah well :P!

      Today was an interesting day. Nothing happened in the first four lessons, it all started to get interesting when we had sport.  We went to Smithfield to play them, and Louise had come over to say "hello". She gave me the Grande Royale tour of Smithfield (the bus driver we had really hates that school. He said it breeds trailer trash). Anyway, Smithfield High is more of a hole than my school! I was shocked. But anyway. We sat under a tree and watched the the game talking about stuff, and as I was getting up to leave we had this discussion:   L:  Would you ever go out with me?  A:  Yer, probably. Why? [ I was thinking it was some kind of "noone lones me" thing... ]  L:  Will you go out with me? *silence*  A:  Ummm...  L:  Come onnn! *silence*  L:  I hate you! [ said jokingly ] So yer, I got on the bus without giving her an answer. If I didn't have Kieran I would've said yes, but I do. She's not a bad looking chick, 'n' shes really nice 'n' stuff... Shoulda said yes?

      I'm sick of Firefox's crashing. I'm using a 3rd party build, and at the moment, I'm too slack to download an official build.    Maths  This latest update is comin to ya from the Maths department. I handed in my Maths C assignment. God knows how I did... I did get an answer for The Dreaded Monkey Problem. I'll go through that another time.   But, from one assignment to another. I just started on my Maths B assignment, and in a few words, it's a Piece of Shit. Biorhythms and sine waves and all that crap. Stuff I'll never use again. But, as always, it'll be written up and posted on the interest. Speaking of writing up, I'll do my monkey problem up and how I got my answer 'n' all that the other day. Bet y'all can't wait.    BRISBANE  Only two more sleeps until I go to Brisvegas. Wo0t. I'm so nervous about seeing Kieran though. What if he hates me?!    Aren't these headings getting annoying?!  So, thats enough of those. I'm gettin sick of them too :p  I'm bored. I can call Kieran in 35 minutes. But do I want to? Of course... I guess...?  OOH OOH OOH.   What's the goss, Adam?  (sorry, couldn't help myself)  Anywho, there is friction between Ellen and Corinne, because Corinne is going with Richmond to do her English assignment and Ellen has been left in the lurch with noone to do it with. Ellen has been bitching about Cori all day. So meh.  Also, this is what I heard about Emma and Tanya's little happening. Tanya is pissed at Emma because Tanya and Tim aren't talking, but Emma still likes Tim. Or something. Let's just say it's silly bitchy girly fighting.   Adam's Alter Ego-slash-Person with the same name  (last one, I promise)  I have a twin! Adam Roe, an ex-Professional Skateboarder started  urlLink Lunchbox Studios  in 1990. Wow. A professional skateboarder. I wish it was me.   Yibbedee Yibbeda, that's all folks  (baha, I had my fingers crossed)  That's all for today :P

      This post has nothing to do with Trains. Ok.  Kieran keeps lieing to me. I don't like it. It's not big things, but I keep catching him out. Maybe I'm wrong... I haven't said anything though. If he does anything like it when I meet him, I will catch him out. *shifty eyes*  The other day Tanya asked me to do our english assignment together, 'n' I said yes. Today in Maths she was talking to Glen and he asked if she was doing it with me. She said no, he didn't believe her and called out to me "I'm not doing my english think with you am I Adam?", but she said it as if I was the devil and she'd never do anything with me. I was a bit cut =|.  Tara confronted me about her not liking me or some such. She said something along the lines of "I do". Oh, and I'm going to the formal next year with Emma. Wo0t ;). She owes me a kiss at midnight anyway... :D  Baha, I'm on the phone to Kieran (again). Yeh... Wah wah wah. All he does is whinge :P Ah well. I luff him!

      OMG.   C : Let's go to the movies!  A : Sure.  B : I can give you a ride in if you give me a ride home  A : Ok, cool. Who's going?  B : No idea. Can you call all your friends?  A : No  B : Why?  B : Are you scared of rejection? *silence*  C : You're such a retard sometimes, Adam  B : Yer or something along those lines.  *5 minutes later*  B : It's not happining any more because noone is going Geez, Bri. You don't even like Tara and Emma. And if you like them enough to go to the movies with them, you should be able to call them yourself.  It's not like Tara likes me any more anyway, considering I've changed 'n' all.   And whoever is commenting, please sign your posts with your name, or create and/or login with a Blogger ID. It taked 30 seconds FFS.  Fuck the world...!  On another note, my new template is coming along nicely, although I can't keep my mind on one thing for long enough to finish it. Ah well... I don't care.  Last night I had a dream where everyone read what I write on here. Not like theres nothing interesting, but meh. I don't remember what happened, either.   This morning/afternoon was Fresh Obsession training at Abbot St. I won a $5 Woolies gift voucher. I bought Tim Tams. They were mediocre.

      Corinne 'n' Bri just left. They came over.   We talked a bit. Nothing interesting. In fact, they left because I was boring them (after helping themselves to my (parents) alcahol). Great, hey.  Ah well, split my night up a bit, which would otherwise be boring.  Speaking of stoners, Jesse is having a gathering at his place tonight. And guess who wasn't invited. If you guessed " Adam ", then you guessed CORRECTLY! Pfft... I don't think I'd be missing out on much. "Such 'n' such is soooo prime", "let's light up another joint", "chuck us another smoke" and "lets play with ourselves". Ok, I made the last one up. But MEH! We all know I'm right. Don't we =|  Anyway, I'm getting used to this not-getting-invited-anywhere thing. It's not a big deal, so long as school stays alright.  Corinne said that Tara said that I've changed since I started hanging around with Ellen. Well, T... I  dunno. Maybe if you stopped picking on me I might be more likely to hang around with you. All you do is whinge about my flaws. I don't think you've said a nice thing to me for ages. Or maybe I'm just imagining things. Yes, I think I am.   Meh, I have come to the conclusion that being unpopular has lots of bad things. WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE MEEEEEEEEEEE?!  P.S. Please note that this is [probably] depression talking.

      Today was pretty shit.  Maths C was alright, but I jkept making stupid mistakes and got pissed off.  In German Frau Haring had a go at me because I left my oral at home. So I had a go back at her and went to the library and spoke to Tanya.  At lunch we had a water fight. That was good.  In Chemistry Mr Round was having one of those "I-can't-teach-for-shit" days, and I didn't understand a word he was saying. So I was rude and sarcastic, which I'm sorry for. Karmann said I'm gonna drive him to a mental breakdown and/or suicide. Great.  Physics was alright, if not a bit boring. I'm kinda sick of it.  I DUN WANNA GO TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY. I just wanna see Kieran.

      Ok, so, after Firefox eating my post I've come to try again.   Um... School is alright. Tanya has settled down about Karmann, I think... Wait. I'm talking out of my ass. I have no idea, really.   But, next week on Thursday I'm heading down Brissy way for a doctors appointment, and then to see Kieran. I'm scared... Things aren't exactely peachy between us, so what if he hates me? He rang me about an hour ago to see if this between us were ok, and he made me promise that they are. *tinkle* was the sound as a 5c coin went into the lie jar.  I mean, I love Kieran so much, but he's still trying to "Find himself" or what the fuck I think. Like, he's not sure if hes gay or not. He's had cock-in-ass plenty of times before, but why is he questioning it now? Maybe it's because he's a fuck-n-run type, and ain't ready for commitment. Or maybe he hasn't had any experience (like me) and is scared so is running away.   I'm so scared.  Meh, I should be doing German homework, but fuck that. I'm so over LOTE.   Sleepy time for me soon, I think...

      I had a crapload of stuff that I was going to whinge about today, but I forgot!  Ok, firstly. Ellie. It's like, most of the girls vs. Ellie and Karmann. Tanya 'n' Tara and Co. resent that since Karmann came back to Peace, Ellie has ditched them. I spoke to Ellie about it, and she said that they ditched her too. I told Tanya, and she said "That's crap! We still  try  to talk to them, but as soon as Karmann comes, she leaves". Anyway, at recess today she spent some time with them, and Tanya said to me "At least she's trying". I guess it'll get better! [Edit: ^^^^ That was /very/ incoherent :$]  The past few day's I've been reading Lizzy's blog. It's about of the same standard as mine (HAHAHAHA), so  urlLink check it out  if you have nothing better to do.    urlLink Penis Owner's Manual , for those gyuys who don't know how to use one, and for the girls who want to know ;)  Um. I don't know what else to say... OH! Aphrodite got evicted from Big Brother *tear*. She rocked! YOU ROCK APH!

      God damn! I didn't know I still had this pink crap on! Damn. Ah well. *change*  Today for our comparative religion course, we went to the Cairns Buddhist Center. We listened to this old guy who was a monk for 30 years talk about Buddha's teachings. It was really interesting -- he said that all other religions require you to pray to a god, and he said that Buddhism isn't a religion, it's a way of life. You treat your mind as a god, I suppose. He went on to say how Buddhism is peace orientated, and because there is no "truth" (like in Islam and Christianity), there is no fighting about which is more right (like Islam and Christianity).  Anyway, I think it's got a lot more going for it than Christianity.

      Last night I watched the most disgusting thing. We should all know about the  urlLink decapitation of Nick Berg . Anyway, I watched the video of it (available on  your  urlLink Favourite   urlLink P2P   urlLink Client . It wasn't so much gory as distressing, because you can hear him screaming!  Although it seems real at first glance, after reading some opinions on the video, it looks like he was already dead when they gave him the big snip. The Atzlan News Bulliten says that it's a  urlLink fraud . About  urlLink 6,250 other websites  are also reporting the same.  How interesting.

      I kept talking to Kieran last night, and we got all teary eyed and stuff, but I  think  we're all good again. Meh, I am starting to get sick of his crap though.   He says he loves me, but if he loves me WHY THE FUCK IS HE QUESTIONING HIS SEXUALITY. I'm going down there in just under two weeks, and he decides to change his mind days before I see him for the first time? Not happy, Jan!  So yer. I have a new layout on the way... It's really basic, because I'm not in the mood for a comples layout. I'm lazy.

      OH KAY. So, Kieran and I are on good terms again, I think. I continue to wonder if he discovered his sexuality, but meh. Can't win 'em all!  This afternoon was the cross country run. Six kilometers of joy. I only walked three kilometers, and I got pissed off and sat down under the tent. AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW!  As part of our school betterment program, the students are doing a S.W.O.T. (Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities and Threats) analysis. So, most of the points brought up were about the lack of cleanliness around the school. Like lack of clean toilets, poor looking gardens and the such. One of the points brought up though, was the scabbiness of the school's  urlLink web site .   And I agree. Look at the scabbiness! It's ugly. So some of the girls (namely Tara and Tanya) enlisted me to redesign the schools website. Well, I haven't been enlisted yet, but I can only assume that the piece of paper is sitting on his desk, and Mr Mason is thinking "Hmm... I don't like that Adam boy anyway".

      Frau Haring is a stupid German bitch who should die. That is all.  BUT KIERAN. Meh! Jesus. It's not that had. Do you like me, or don't you? He says he does. But if that's the case why the fuck is he questioning it? ARRGH.  Fuck, I love him to bits, but he is such a drama queen some times.

      This arvo I went to Smithfield with Ellen, Bridie, Ashlee and Cheree. We had coffee (and I had scones) at The Coffee Works... 'Twas yum. Except that I was re-breathing second hand smoke from their incessant smoking :|!  Anywho, after that we went to Jeans West and I bought some new jeans and some tees. I gotta look good for my baby when I go down.  Speaking of Kieran, he texted me today and said Adam im really confused at the moment just about everything anyway ill call you tonight. And Adam says "Dubya Tee Eff, mate?" I mean, fuck! He says he loves me all the time. He called me while I was having my cappucino to say "I Love You", and then not 20 minutes after we hang up I get a message saying he's not sure about us.  What the fuck?  He's calling me tonight, so I'll sort it out then, I hope. I'm freakin coming down in less than two weeks, and he springs this shit on me now? Fuck man.  While I was waiting for the bus I had a deep'n'meaningful with Ellen. She said that the same thing happened between her and Steven, so it's good that I'm not the only one. She also said that Rex likes her more than she likes him, even though they seem to be all over eachother (from what I'm told). She said that if Steven were to move to Cairns, she'd ditch Rex like that (not nice, but pfft). Steven sounds hot, too :D.  I hope things are ok with Kieran and I. I love him to bits, and I don't want anything to come between us!

      Ha, a new blog.  It uses  urlLink Blogger , so if you have a Blogger ID I'm happy to add you so you can post here. Woo!  Today, I worked from 5pm till 9:30. And it sucked nuts. But it wasn't all bad: I was on express for a while, which was good... Meh.   As soon as I got home, I ate, then jumped on the phone to Kieran. I'm still on the phone to him now. I can't wait till I go down and see him, but SHIT! I am so scared about it.... What if he hates me, or thinks I'm ugly... He says he's not like that, but sometimes he does act like the stuckup populat boy stereotype.  But Meh, I love him to bits and I don't wanna lose him. (heard that before?)

      Ahem.  It's been a while, so heres what's going on.  Today: I AM SICK OF DUMBSHIT CUSTOMERS! If you see me put something through wrong, open your dumbshit mouth, and say something (thus removing your dumbshit status). Sure, it might not be an inconveniece to you to go up to the service counter and scream "SCANNING POLICY" and get an item for free, it is for me because I get the supervisors on my back.  Yesterday: Public holiday! Wo0t!  Sunday: Work. 5 hours. Surrounded by dumbshit customers.  Saturday: Work. 5 hours. Surrounded by dumbshit customers.   Friday: Work, I think. Last exam (German speaking and listening). I think I did well in the listening, but in the speaking I royally fucked my word order, so I probably got a B at best. I had my English debate with Tanya. We got a B, which is damn good for jsut improvising! Go us. Adders and Tan, woO!  Thursday: More exams. Shit.   And um, that's it!  At work, there's a really, really hot guy -- Joseph. He works in fresh produce. And he's gay. I'm sure, because he just SCREAMS prettyboy. I was talking to Cameron (don't be shocked!), and he says he acts a bit gay at school too.   He's so hot! I'd hit it, anyway ;)  But, ah, he (like the remaining 100% of the world [except for Galen. And Bill]) are too good for me. How depressing!  Um, and that's it. I had some more to write, but I can't think about it. Oh yeah, on Saturday I'm going out bush for three weeks with the parental units. Can't wait! Except dad'll be a fucktard for the most part (as usual). Meh.

      Heh. The B in Maths C is good, I think. It's what I got last term, so I'm keepin it up! The B is a bit disappointing, but meh. I expected it. I hate trig. If I don't see another triangle in my life it won't be a bad thing.   I had my German reading and writing exams today. I think I did alright. No worse than a B, surely. I think I did pretty well in physics and chem, I hope...!  I'm working on my english assignment now. It's slowly taking shape. Well, it's only notes (coz we aint allowed to use a full script :|).   Ooh, Ellie just called me and told me what to prepare for German speaking tomorrow. Great stuff, hey... :|  Um, yeah. THats about it.  Oh, a paradox: You buy 100 kilos of potatoes and are told that they are 99% water. After leaving them outside, you discover that they are now 98% water. The weight of the dehydrated potatoes is then a surprising 50 kg! Gimme proof, baby! (I'll post it tomorrow, if I remember)

      Meh!  I want a boyfriend or a girlfriend.  Did I mention that Cameron asked me out again? Through an SMS? I declined with thanks, thankyou very much. In fact it wasn't with thanks at all.  I'm going to Jess's party on Friday night, I think. I should prolly find some alcy to bring. Meh. Do I even wanna get drunk?  I think I'm falling on (bad choice of words). Let's try that again. I think I'm falling for Jess. She's being really nice to me. She's like "Oooh, I love you Adam!" I'm like *:|* "What the?" Except... It's good. I like it. Do I like Jess? Does Jess even like me? I think I'm misguided. I think I'd take anything I can get at the moment.  Um... Yeah. She's nice, and not too bad looking and meh! I bet she's already got a man. That or she's a dyke.  I'm so confused!  *scream*

         That's my new calculator. Do y'all like my attempt at product photography? I didn't have it on Trace, though, so it doesn't look as good as it could.  I took it with my new camera, a Kodak EasyShare DX4530. It's pretty good, with a dock, 5.0 MP and 3x optical zoom. All for $470 ($200 of which payed by the insurance company!)  Now, the past week was exams, and I did pretty good in chem and physics (I hope), and pretty damn good in Maths C. Now, what I'm worried about is my Maths B exams. It was today, and I think I did pretty shit. It's bad, because I'm gonna get an A in C, but a C (or worse!) in B. How depressing.  I still haven't started my English assignment with Tanya yet. I think we're royally fucked!  I haven't heard from Kieran in ages. I hope he's OK! I would call him at the hospital, but I don't know which one he's staying at.   Um, yeah. I'm bored now!  I'm still working on the new CSS layout. I'm takin my time, hey.  Noone comments any more. I think I'll cry!

      He called me from the hospital. I know this for a fact because I spoke to the nurse (she sounded hawt!). We sorted some things out. We didn't say we loved eachother. Which upsets me. But meh! What can ya do?  I bought my new digicam yesterday. Kodak DX4530. It takes good piccies!  Tonight I've been haning out in maths chatrooms on undernet.  I feel like a nerd. Interesting, though.  Just finished physics. It sucks.   Post more tomorrow.  After exams.  Wish my luck.  Bye all!

      If you guessed Adam, you guessed right.  It's an interesting story, ya know. I had en extension until Wednesday this week (at least he nodded when I asked him last week). I forgot to bring it on Wednesday... well, not forgot, hadn't finished it. He didn't ask me for it so I didn't give it over.  I bring it to Maths C today and hand it in. He says  B: Sorry, Adam. I can't mark this. A: Um...? B: You handed it in late, and the rule is that if an assignment is handed in late it you'll get 0. A: So I'm gona fail Maths B? [that's my half assed attempt at a guilt trip] B: Well, the assignment was mostly MAPS, so it won't affect your mark too much A: Ok *silence* *back to work* I'm clearly pissed off!  I mean... I'm a maths fan-boy! I do two maths well, and he decides to fail me coz I'm two days late? WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?!

      ... JESS WAS CRACKING ON TO ME IN ENGLISH!  Woah. There were signs...  She asked me who I thought would make good couples,  she was writing "I (heart) you" on her leg  she wrote "i (heart) you" on my arm  she was leaning on me  ... Ok, so maybe it's not that many signs, and I'm just mis-reading the signs that were there. Oh, and she asked me to the formal next year. Woah... I have three chicks after me! Tara, Emma and now Jess want to go to the formal with me. Or maybe they were kidding.   Or maybe I'm a tool when it comes to things like this...

      After I got off the phone to Kieran last night, he texts me and says "im going to the hospital, ill call you later". I call him and asked why. He said he swallowed all his [anti-depressant] pills. I was shocked and said "Um, ok, call me tomorrow."  Today I got some SMS's asking me if I belived him. We had a quick relay of SMSs saying that I did rah rah rah. Eventually I snapped and said "Why wouldn't I believe you? What is there for me not to believe? Why did you do it in the first place?" Needless to say, I didn't get a reply. I called him a few times, and he didn't answer. I got an SMS saying "hey gorgous i wont be able to talk 4 a while but i love u. And dont 4 get it. Im in a clinic and i have to hand in my fone".  I'm thinking about calling "BULLSHIT" because meh. Why would you say "I love you" and then 5 minutes later OD on anti-depressants? Meh. He could just be attention seeking. But MEH! I'm sick of it.  He can call me when he gets out. Or never.   I'm over this shit.

       That's right, work was DEAD tonight. I worked five hours and sold $6800 of stuff. That's real slow!  Mika told me she got her period, albeit five days late.  Aaron and my rocket launcher is finished! We're launching our air/water rocket on Monday in periods one and two.  Today sucked because I had 200 minutes of maths - four periods. It wasn't very good =(. In Maths B I learnt basic differentiation. I was interested in it because in Maths C the grade 12s are doing it all the time. It looked interesting. But, really, it wasn't. It was a real anticlimax and it was really depressing.  I'm getting my computer back tomorrow morning. New motherboard and new RAM. Yay. Pfft, damn lightning strikes causing power surges *mumble mumble*.  I wonder if anyone reads this. Pfft, probably not. Why would ya?

        urlLink  It has been revealed that  urlLink Trinity Anglican School  promotes less intelligent students to not complete the QCS test and not qualify for an OP.  For the past several years TAS has boasted very good OP band results (ie. 25% of all year 12 students recieved OPs in the 1-7 band).   For the uninitiated, the QCS test determines what OP positions are available at a school. That is, they determine what any student at a school gets, not what OP the test taker recieves.  By convincing people who wouldn't do as well to not sit the test, the OPs that can be given for TAS goes up. -->

       Hmm, a lot has changed, to say the least!  On Friday I went to the show with Mika and her friend Priss(cilla). She's really cute! But I love Mika mostest. Mika and I didn't go on any rides, so we ended up meeting up with Emma, Emma, Tara and Ella. I shouted Tara a ride on the Alpine Express, so it wasn't too bad. Tara thought she was gonna be sick, but she wasn't so it's all good.  The thing is, I was getting  really  close to Mika and stuff. And I enjoyed it! Maybe I'm turning straight... *shock!*!  A few days ago Mika told me she got knocked up by Steve, and her period is late, by, err... six days now. Shit. Anyway, she's gonna buy a test on the weekend, and if she is preggers she wants to get an abortion. She said she doesn't have enough money for one so I'm contributing to the "If-Mika-is-pregnant-get-her-an-abortion Fund". Which I'm happy to do, because Mika rocks my world.  Um. I had a few other things to write about, but I forget what I was going to say. Meh!  I'm soooo totally pissed of with German. Totally!  In Chemistry I flicked Karmann on the side of the face. She's having a hatey on me now. Soooo not cool!  Oh, and my computer broke. That explains the shortage of updates. I should be getting an upgrade, so it could be all good. I think I lost all my music, though. All 4 days worth: 1750 or so songs. Meh!   Right now I'm posting from Dad's work laptop. It's really cool!   3GHz P4  256mb RAM  40gb HDD  EXCELLENT screen   Dad say's I'm inheriting it when I go to Uni. Not too bad a hand-me-down, I say!  Trevor won Big Brother 4, and became a millionaire. Then proposed to his wife. He accepted -- what a surprise! He's rich, famous, and um... yeh. You would've accepted too!

It's been tinkered with a bit, so wrap you eye-candy (BAHA) on this:  urlLink http://adam.l2p.net/lightbox/temp/bb5m2.gif  (.gif image, 62kb, 800x900).

      Yesterday I worked. BUT! I wrote down 10:30am start on a piece of paper, but I thought "NAH! That's can't be right!" So, I said to mum "work starts at 11:30". But, just as we were leaving at ten past eleven I got a phone call from a very pissed of sounding Susie (my boss).     "Adam," she said. "You were supposed to start work at 10:30. Where are you? Call me!" Man... She sounded pissed. So, I quickly hurried out of the house (mum not too happy either!)    I got to work and checked what register I was on when I heard Narelle (my other boss) say "Gee, sleep in Adam?" and I said "Nah... My dog ate my roster". She laughed. THEN! I saw the demon herself... Susie. I heard the funeral march playing in the background. Woah.    "Where were you?" she asked.   "Would you believe me if I said my dog ate my roster?" I quipped. Susie gave me a questioning look.   "NO, I don't believe you" she said.  I shrugged: "Ok," I paused. "Sorry I'm late, there was (yet another) roster mixup". She gave me another disaproving look.   "I guess this means you'll be staying behind until 4:30 to make up for lost time?"  "Absolutely"  "Heh, you wouldn't dare argue with me now, would you?"  "No," I murmered. "Sorry!"     So there you have it. Adam's great personality saved the day. Go Adam!    But... today was really boring! Nothing interesting at all happened. Although, Tanya did say me and Jess were getting awfully close at lunch. Pfft... That's bad why?      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TARA!   Really folks, she only looks like that when she's with me. I'm that boring!

      I spoke to Kieran for the first time in about 2 weeks today. And like five minutes into the call (after I appologised - what for though? I did N-O-T-H-I-N-G) he started whinging about me. "You don't talk enough", "we have nothing in common", rah rah rah. He keeps making it sound like he's too good for me. Which, in some ways, is true. He's really good looking, and popular (sometimes!) and outgoing (sometimes!). But, if he put any other mere mortal male or female through the shit he's out me through (trying to top himself, "apart time", sooky Sue mode, whinging and whining) he'd be gone!  I don't know why I even answered the phone when he called me... I've been happy ever since I stopped talking to him. I think I'm gonna stop!  Ya know, he said he loved me, and that made me feel all warm on the inside. But now, he can be a cock (well, he has for a while, and I noticed, and now I feel liberated) and I'm sick of it.  GO me!

      shiitttttt... I was just looking through my music and found "Baby I Love You" by J. Lo.   I remember that Kieran told me to download ages ago, when we only just started talking on the phone.  Shittt.  I love Kieran, but I am so sick of his shit. So much so I've started losing all feelings for him. He's me me me all the time. And so hormonal, I guess. I wonder if it would be any different is he was here.

      Man!  After having like 5 sad songs in a row, I think I've stopped being all teary eyed!  Half way through the run of sad songs, I was gonna tell Tanya how I used to have a crush on Jessica. Why am I thinking of Jessica, you ask? WELL. I was looking over my photos and found this:  urlLink http://adam.l2p.net/lightbox/index.php?p=97 . And woah. I'm starting to wish I did have someone like that. As Ryan from Big Brother would say, she's a great chick.  But now I'm thinking about Ella. We got  really  close in German. I was thinking "wow... I'd  love  her to be mine". BUT SHIT WOAH MAN! I bet you're thinking, woah man, you're gay! But thats bizarre, because I'm starting to question that myself. Just the way I feel sometimes. Like towards Ella and Jess and Ellie. And others. Liek woah.  And Kieran is calling me. I don't wanna talk to him. I'm getting really sick of his shit!  Arrgh!

      ... batman. It's been a while!  For the record, I got back from hols on saturday. For the inqusitive sods out there, have some photos  urlLink here .   But this week has just been strange. It was an emotional rollercoaster! On tuesday I was the epitome of depressed because I didn't want to be back at school. We got new timetables though. But they just made me more depressed because it turns out I have quadruple maths in friday. Yes, thats right! Maths C, Maths C, recess, Maths B, Maths B. Then Chemistry and Applied Maths (Physics) after lunch. Yay.  Then, on wednesday, something happened in Core P.E. that really made me feel... weird! Tanya was like lieing on me and we were talking and it was like "woah". Maybe thats the emotional rollercoaster thing though. BUT! Tim got his hair cut and woah! He looks really, really hot! I was shocked. But enough about Tim. It seemed like I connected with Emma and Tanya and stuff... I was speaking to them both heaps I think.   Today was strange. Ella made me piggy back her (not made, I guess. I coulda said no!) to the library for German. Then while we were listening to an audio from the CD, she sat behind me on the chair, and wow. It felt so right! ... How bizarre?!  Speaking of love, or lack there of, me and Kieran haven't spoken in what seems like ages! Why? Well, we had a fight? Why? Because he wanted some time apart. Why? STOP SAYING WHY! But seriously, he didn't say why.  We didn't speak for a few days and then he texted me saying "you can call me if you want". I said to myself "you were the one who didn't want to talk" and I ignored it. He rang me a few times while I've been asleep, but I haven't returned his calls. I guess I'm a bit pissed off. While we were talking he often said "I don't know why you keep putting up with my shit". Ha, me either. So, as the classics say, "the manure has hit the mistrel". Nice, eh?  On wednesday night I spoke with Sana for the first time in ages. And we're bonding like rabbits "bond". HA! But nah, it's like it was aaggeess ago.  For the first time in ages it seems like some stuff is going right in my life!  Except for the fact that I'm lacking a boyfriend or girlfriend. Ya know, I've been falling asleep all teary eyed 'coz I want someone to hold  that  bad! Well, reading  urlLink The Least of These  (a  great  story about two gay lovers, and there trials and tribulations). Seriously, it's good. Even if you're not gay, just read it and skip the sex bits! I was quite emotional at times!   OH SHIT. And now "Ghost of a Good Thing" by Dashboard Confessional is playing in iTunes. AND IM ALL TEARY EYED!  HOLY SHIT. What is going down in Adam-land! Even Corinne and I bonded for a bit today. I'm shocked!  And Ellen! She was shocked that I was in such a good mood. She even noticed.  It seems like I haven't been this good for ages!  All I need is a S.O. Please...!

       Ok folks, right now I'm preparing to move my blog over to my new layout, over at  urlLink Table Two . It should be pretty painless, but let's wait and see :P  It was the sports carnival today. I sat around and did not much at all, and I still got sunburnt. How shocking. I went in no events, so there was no chance of me embarrasing myself by tripping or coming last or what ever.  Oh, and thats for ditching me this arvo, Tara. You  didn't  need to wait for Emma. Ah well, no big deal. Didn't wanna talk to you anyway...

       From the labs of Table Two come,     Table Two Botox Alternative     That's right, instead of costly and painful botox injections, the cunning researchers at Table Two labs bring you "Chicken-Man's Botox Replacement". These handy glove-shaped latex wrappers fit over your head, producing the same permanently expressionless result as costly and painful botox injections.   CMBR's come in boxes of 100, for the low low cost of AU$4.99. We use ultra sensetive and ultra strong        To use, simply insert head into opening, until over mouth, then blow until expanded (as above). Release, and roll end up until over forehead.  Next comes Table Two's patented CMBR cover up technology. Simply choose a wig from our wide collection, then play it on top of the glove.  Excellent.

       This stuff:          Conrad Sewell, and Australian Idol-er  urlLink reviews  Mary-Kate and Ashlee's CD/Soundtrack for  urlLink When In Rome .     Eric Bana to be  urlLink the next 007 ?  New  urlLink iPods ! Tim has one, and I am having major iPod lust  and  jealousy!     I am not a very good rocket scientist. Our launcher is great - except for the fact that the air-in hole is to close to the water-in hole and never gets to the rocket. Meh!     I continue to be single. I don't like it much at all.     I am going to fail English this term unless I write a 3 minute monologue as Denny from  urlLink Educating Rita .  I got my computer back! With new RAM and a new motherboard. My second hard disk was fried, so I lost all my web designs and music and downloads and games. Meh, nothing that can't be replaced. Just have to download. Lots!   Tara - STOP READING!  I have just realised Aaron is amazingly good looking. He might not be everyone's cup of tea, but hey! He's mine *gay!*. Um, yeah.  TARA - CONTINUE READING!  Tim's also pretty good looking - he has nice legs!     ... I just realised how gay that sounds. Let's hope this doesn't get into the wrong hands...        And that's it. Consider yourself updated on Adam's life!

        urlLink  Crap. It looks like  urlLink rufan-redi  have a contract with Southern Star Endemol or Ten, because the Big Brother website is off, and has a  urlLink holding page . The author meta tag says rufan-redi are  still  developing it.   That's bad for me because there goes any chance of a contract, and here comes yet another shitty, boring BB website. Crap.  In other news, I made kids cry at work today! "You cold, heartless prick!", I hear you cry. "Ha!", I reply. I didn't really make them cry. They were just dumb kids and made themselves cry.   Mr Seven comes up to my register and hands me a toy truck and says "Is this five dollars" in a sweet, innocent voice. I check, and nod and say "Yes". He then proceeds to hand me a five cent coin as payment. I say, in the nicest possible way, "That's five  cents , not five  dollars. " Then he goes all puppy-dog eyed and says "Puh, puh, puh-leease?" I say "no", because I don't want my till out by $4.95! Then he starts crying and mum comes along and says to her child "You can't buy that with five cents" and gives me a "Sorry, what could I do?" look.  Ms Five stands next to my register and plays with the little laser thing that makes the conveyer belt go. She plays with it making it stop and go, then when takes her hand away one time it doesn't go at all. I joke, "You broke it!" and try switching it on or off a few times, but alas! It still doesn't work. "Oh crap, it  really  doesn't work", I say. Ms Five sees the pained-slash-scared look on my face at starts crying in to her mum's leg. I feel bad, and say "Don't worry, they stop working all the time", but the snivelling continues. It starts working again a few moments later and I show her that it's all good, but she keeps crying. I get another "Sorry, what could I do?" look. I don't think she'll be playing with registers again any time soon, though...   Yes, another un-eventful day in my five hour shift at Woolies.   I had a kebab for lunch. I was feeling sick before I ate it, and I felt even worse after I ate it. Heh. I still feel like shit, so I think I might take a sicky tomorrow. Meh.
