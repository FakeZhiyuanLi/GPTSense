      Today I started this new job...well actually more like trying it out. I'm still wondering if I should stick with this job or go for the other job that I have yet to interview.  I miss him. I broke up with him last night. Even though I cared for him deeply, I knew that the relationship between us was not healthy. We called each other a bunch of names last night over the telephone. It wasn't pretty. He accuses me of verbal abuse, I accuse him of being manpulating and an ass kisser. He totally blew up when I called him an ass kisser. It got worse after that.  After we hung up on each other, I took a shirt that he had left behind in the apartment, took a huge cleaver, and tore up his shirt. It was like actually stabbing him instead of the shirt. After a few minutes, I stopped what I was doing and sobbed. I knew right then and there that it was over.  I called him back, which by then was 4am in the morning, and told him it was over. He sounded upset, or perhaps he had sounded that way because he was woken up. I didn't care. I had to say my piece.  I feel rather sad, but I also feel a sense of relief. I do miss talking to him on the phone. I could talk to him about almost everything. I miss the silly private jokes we have with each other, I miss discussing magick with him, I miss doing my comic in front of him, and he would give me positive feedback. However, it could not continue. Especially with his little white lies, and the fact that he guilted me so bad when I went to Maryland. He almost ruined my trip, but not quite.  Today I helped myself to two free cups of Chai tea, which soothed me. Then I helped myself to another cup of tea, but this was a relaxation tea. I had not drank a hot cuppa tea in a long tea. So not only was it tasty, but it had comforted me. I remember when my mother would make me "milky tea" when I was sick as a child. So having hot tea today was rather nice.  I could tell when someone is thinking about me. I felt him think about me today during the job training, but it could be my mind playing tricks on me. We always had this weird connection. However, I have to keep reminding myself that this guy is no good for me.  I thought about leaving the lodge that me and him both belong to. However, strangely enough, little coinstances like "Mr. so-and-so Crowley" and a message from a local lodge brother were kinda like hints, saying I should not give up. Only right now I can't bear to attend local events. It hurts too much.

      I decided to start a brand new blog while keeping the one I have on Live Journal. Too many people know me on LJ, so I figure I would publish the more personal details here.
