       Okay, this is really freaky..I checked the statistics of who has been visiting my blog...like IP address-wise..and I checked to see where they were coming from..and wtf. I don't know how some people got the address to my blog if I never gave it to them..and it's not on any search engines or whatever. This is really freaking me out. BAH! So, if you're reading this and I didn't give you the link, comment or something and let me know who you are. Please! lol. So, then at least I'll know that you're not some stalker or something. =P

       Oh my god. I just talked to Dustin & he is hurt. The poor little thing sprained his ankle and can't walk until Wednesday at the earliest. He missed a step and fell at work. I feel bad for him now &amp; hope that he feels better soon. : ) EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! R.I.C.E. lol :)      I don't want to go to school tomorrow. Bah. But, at least I didn't sprain my ankle and half-die. : (      P.S.....'In Nagasaki, they go funky for your love...oooo, I like bukkake!' LOL- funny animation I saw today. ;)

        I got a haircut! I no longer have a 'fro. Not that I really did, but I had a lot of dead-ends....looked bad, etc. I don't want to go back to school tomorrow. I don't have any classes with my friends. Bah...and I'm only a sophomore. That's depressing. I'll tell you what's even more depressing though...the fact that I might never get to see Dustin ever again .

       I think my brain has exploded! My head hurts so badly right now. Good god. Not that there is one. It's one of those headaches where you think...'it wouldn't be so bad to just go lie out in the middle of the road right about now'...But, I will not. lol. I have things to live for. Not that 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' really is all that spectacular of a thing to live for, but hells bells, who cares.      No one is reading this..blah..blah..blah...I should just go to bed. Nobody is online to talk to and nobody at my house wants to actually talk to me, so what's the point of staying awake? Hmm. I can't think of one. I'm going to start random thought-ing it up in here:      *I wish I was in college..then I'd get to see Dustin.   *Jesse is one cute boy..too bad he's gone off to college too.   *I'm stupid..I'll never amount to anything.   *It's about 800 degrees in this damn house right now.   *I want a grape popsicle..but fresh hell, we don't have any.   *Why the hell isn't anyone online?   *I wonder what Jesse is doing right now..   *I need to make new friends.      Son of a bitch, this is stupid. I'm just going to go to bed. Sweet dreams to me.

       Good afternoon everyone! I just got back from shopping. I had to get some clothes since school starts Tuesday & I had nothing at all to wear. I bought a TON of new shirts and pants and such. I'm triple happy right now. =) I can go back to school now that I have clothes. lol. Well, I'm going to go watch the Olympics...I think the badminton stuff is coming on soon. OH oh..the opening ceremony last night was AWESOME. I loved the crazy Greek guy playing the drum in the water. That was sweet. But, before I go, I want to say HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY to muh boy, Dustin!! Have an awesome day. EEEEEEEEEEEEE! lmao! Don't go to school like the kid in the video. =P       x Have a nice day everyone! x      By the way...go here..   urlLink  http://pwned.nl    It's FUNNY stuff  x 2.

        Hi kids! I'm Beth. This is my blog. I'll update it as much as I can. I guess it would be a good idea if I introduced myself a bit more thoroughly?  Yes. Let's see..I live in southern Illinois, VERY close on the western border of the state by St.Louis, Missouri. I live with my mom, dad, and two older brothers. They can be hilarious sometimes. I've lived here my whole life so far. This part of the country is unbelievably boring and sad. After I finish college, I'm moving EXTREMELY far from this area. Perhaps away from this whole country entirely. *crosses fingers.* Everyone who knows me well knows that it's my dream to live in the true north aka Canada. *giggles* I love-love-love Canada. I have ever since I was like 10 years old. Canadians just seem so much....better (?)....in comparison to Americans. That's just my opinion though; I don't want anyone coming to my house to kill me, so I'm going to leave it at that.  What else to mention...hmm...once August 17th rolls around, I will be going back to school as a sophomore in high school. Be prepared because I will have MANY stories to tell about my school life. I get vicious during the school year; let's just put it that way, lol. I hate school with a passion. I probably wouldn't loathe it so much if it weren't for the idiots that are there. It AMAZES me at how stupid some people can actually be.....and yet, they still survive from day-to-day! Blows my mind. Also, you will notice that I have no school spirit whatsoever. But, I am in a numerous amount of clubs and such. My favorite clubs are Math Team and Saturday Scholars. They're suuuuch a blast. I've met so many people through those. It makes me sad though that the best members of the team (the seniors) aren't going to be there this year. *sniffle.* I will miss them severely! We had such good times. But, I'll have fun this year methinks. I get to take driver' s ed! Hahaha. I'm going to be a horrible, bloody terrible driver. Oh well, though. Maybe since I'm going to learn how to drive, I could get a car for my birthday next year! It's ridiculous....5 people live in this house...4 of them have their own brand-spanking-new cars...what do I have?..NOTHIN' lol..It's sad! I want a car.  Let's see, what to inform you about...umm..I really don't have a life, AT ALL. If I'm not at school or at a school-related event, then I'm more than likely at home. My weekends consist of sleeping, doing homework, and watching Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. Sad, I know, but I like it! Hehehe. But, on a RARE occasion, I might go to the movies, to the mall, or to someone's house overnight. Do not expect me to do these things often though. lol. I'm a loser, as you will soon (if you haven't already) realize.  I also like to watch old school shows on Nickelodeon. Such as: Legends of the Hidden Temple, Global GUTS, and Rocko's Modern Life. They're freaking hilarious. I also LOVE Degrassi. Love-love-love that show, even though here in the states, a lot of the shows are edited for content because the network that the series is shown on here is The N..which, supposedly is a network for YOUNG teenagers...teenagers that shouldn't know about certain things. Lameass. So, the episodes have to be edited. We don't even get to see all of the episodes. How ignunt.  Crapola! It's almost 1AM. I'd better go get some sleep for I have a busy day of nothing ahead of me. Bliss.  Guten Nacht! -Beth
