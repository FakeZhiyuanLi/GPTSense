      I was downtown today, at a location that will remain nameless (legality) with a freind of mine. I sprayed up a stencil of Bush and Saddam kissing. You've seen it if you know satire or stencils. It was pretty clean. I walk a block down to put the wet stencil away, and stay low. This mexican guy pulls up, thick accent, big pickup truck and starts asking me my name. he says he sya me do, and then says he's calling the cops. I was kinda scared at first. then he grabs his cell phon (a cricket phone) and says some numbers into it like it was a walkie talkie. It clearly wasn't. He kept completely serious though and I just kept like I didn't notice (I'd rather he think I'm scared than he actually call the cops). It was clear he was bullshitiing, and wanted nothing to do with the cops. I just kept apologizing, I told him I'd cover it. I was scared breathless, but I couldn't just run.  He wanted to know my name, address and phone number. There was no way in hell I was telling some random guy where I lived, even if he did have some fascimile of authority. He said he knew the owner of the building (no way). He threated me about a fine. I told him I couldn't afford it, that I lived with only my dad out in the burbs (bullshit). Then he tried to tell me it was the club where all the rich people played raquetball (It was an apartment building, or maybe offices for rent, no raquetballs there!). I played it dumb and just listened and looked sympathetic. I told him I had white paint, and would cover it, just not to call my parents. Around this time my friend had called a freind of hers. These to gay boys pull up and get out, wondering whats going on. She told them to stay in the car. This guy from an autoplace nextdoor walks up and starts getting in my face. It was clear he knew the pickup guy.He kept yelling at me telling me it was wrong. I just kept apologizing and saying it would never happen again.At this point my freind pulled me away and we got in the car. When Mr. Pickup got out of his car he walked with a cane ( And I was intimidated!). Now that both men were out of there cars I went and got in my freinds (they wouldn't be able to chase us down now). We drove off to her house with her two freinds to wash my hands and move the paint. I ditched the stencil in a Rite Aid dumpster, and rinsed my hands in lighter fluid (works like paint remover). We hung around her house for a while and I kept getting ansy. Part of me wanted to go back out and put something up, and the other wanted to run to Canada and ask for assylum. The former won, and I cut a new Crimethinc stencil (in cursive!). We slapped it up a few places (even the train window!). She took me home, and now I wait here for the cops to bust down the door (they won't, I'm paranoid). I think I'll go to bed now, do my homework early tommorow.
