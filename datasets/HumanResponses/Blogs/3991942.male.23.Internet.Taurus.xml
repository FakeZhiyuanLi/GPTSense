      Hey all I have put up the new STA-Blog News Rotator on the MSN groups&nbsp;and the STA-Main Web site home page! Now all the posts &amp; comments posted to the STA-Blog will rotate on the top 3 STA web sites!   I will put a rotator on the Yahoo group and try to find some other Affiliates and sites I can add one too.   I will soon be starting the News Letter back up, and it (of course) will also be available from the STA-Blog. I would love your comments and info so I can mae the New version of the News Letter the Best of all!
