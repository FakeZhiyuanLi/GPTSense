      Well...It's Thursday night and I am EXHAUSTED...unpacked and EXHAUSTED. As I sit here in front of the PC, continually ripping my CD's into my IPOD, I am staring at a pile of clothes in which I am striving to fit into my backpack...GOODLUCK!!! Oh well, it shall be an interesting experience.  This whole week has had one theme and that it to tie up loose ends. Which I believe I have done a majority of. (With the exception of one insane thought that Amachi would be pleased to hear I am not going entertain) I still need to make a trip to the NRMA, finalise my resume, and close a bank account. Aside from that all is well. I have said my farewells to many, though I have missed out on a few. Silvana, Shazz, Dave. I never did make it to the city this week.  Monday night I rocked up to my Ats (sis) and Sue's abode and bugged them for old times sake. I spent my Tuesday with my Ats, where we had FUN choosing NanItch...who has been chosen to be my companion.  Wednesday was spent doing last minute shopping, and blood donating. OUCH! Thank you Ross for keeping me company! You helped keep me brave. I coffeed with the girls one last time. It'll be weird not going for coffee at Seedy anymore after work. I had dinner with my Amachi, whom I'll miss very much. You better be using that e-mail address you've set up for me. On the way home I picked up Hyl-IS. We borrowed DVD's and hung out with Lorraine, Mutz, and Ann...with the addition of Nigel who came much later. Today I spent most of it with Val and we had a blast. We lunched, drove to Fairfield (I got us lost), got my hair cut, talked talked talked. Grabe Val, daldal natin noh! After which I dashed over to Chana's house for dinner, where I got to say goodbye to her Mum. Whom I called Mum from our highschool days to now. When that was finished I picked up Jill and Mutz and headed for Rashays to meet up with Ann, Ross, and Hyles!  In my last days what I will remember most is the quality time I have had with my nearest and dearests. Hanging out with the young girls, Mutz, Jilly, Hylin and Lorraine (if even briefly). Spending one on one time with my Ats, and Stitch. Dinner with Amachi. Car rides home with Ross and the conversations that took place in them. My midnight chat with Nige. Ann's constant presence. My revealing day with Val, where we got the chance to get to know each other even better. See you in Switzerland Val and Vlad!!! Tomorrow, as the others come by to bid the last of farewells, it'll be weird I'm sure. Emotional at the very least. I can't believe tomorrow's my last night! Oh my GOSH!!!  Anyways, better start packing...

      Okay...at this point, I thought I would be all geared up and ready to go. I mean, I am no longer working. I've had my farewell party. I've said goodbye to a good portion of my family and friends...and nope...DENIAL!!! I mean you'd think that considering I have been planning this trip in my head for about a decade I would be a little bit more, what's the word.... ENTHUSED? I mean yes I am excited. Heck this is like an awesome experience ahead of me. I am looking forward to it. I guess it's the whole idea...it's not quite sinking in. I'm actually going to be in another country a week from today. HOMESICK like nothing else I'm sure. Still suffering from puffy eyes and hoarse voice from having to say goodbye to my Ats, (whom to anyone that knows me, know that I am completely and devotedly - if there's such a word...dependent on) My Ats has been there for me every step of the way, through every step of the way. I will be lost without her, but I know as well as she does that this experience is something I need to have. It's going to be fantastic no matter what. I'm sure this trip will play a huge part in the moulding of the me of what's ahead. A little older, a lot wiser...well one can only hope!  Even today/tonight, saying goodbye to those I am close to, family and close friends (those that turned up)...it was surreal! It was almost like I was just celebrating a birthday. The best part of it was seeing people I don't regularly see. Seeing my high school friends is always a treat and after so long, being able to pick up where we left of is always such a blessing. Jade and Chana have been my friends since we were in year eight, and we have been through the tests of time, and whatever sagas have come our way.  Seeing my best bud...thank you Bipo for making the hike all the way here! For your present and all it represented and the sentiment it holds. Know that has a place in my backpack during my travels, as I am sure it will be me great comfort through some lonely times. Only you.... enough said!   After countless shots and drinks, I am surprised to be sitting upright! I'm sure it has a lot to do with the jumping up and down with Tess, Stitch (Sue aka Sooby), and my Ats. Hey T, we have a theme song.... 'TROUBLE' ahh gee, that sounds accurate! Next year, watch out UK!!!   To my other friends who were there...thank you! (If you're reading this!) Your presence, all those there, meant a great deal. I'm going to miss everyone HEAPS!!! Without Win who will boss me around? Hehe! Ann, who else will be predictably late for everything, and be the constant butt of our jokes (in a loving way of course) Mer, red licorice!!!...need I say more? Ahhh, and Ross, who deserves a special mention. My train buddy, lunch buddy, the other half of what's left of the Parramatta Posse...who else would be willing to share their Nutella sandwich or Chicken Kebab with me *sigh* Awww shucks!   Thank you Foxy Roxy for traveling all this way. Warren and Purds too!   Anyways...that's all I pretty much remember. I have a big week ahead. Which will definitely be interesting. Hope I'll get the chance to see everyone. If not, I'll see you all when I get back! Take care! God Bless! Peace Out!! Nanu Nanu!

      Greetings from LONDON! I'm finally here. After so many years of planning and what not, here I am. I would love to say that I am instantly in love with the place and that I'm all excited, but... I'm HOMESICK. I miss my family! It dawned on me as I boarded the plane in the Philippines that I wasn't headed for home as I would normally be after such a trip. Instead I was going to an unknown country where I know no one. I FREAKED OUT. When we got to Bangkok for refuelling, all I wanted to do was jump on the plane headed for home. At the age of 25, I never wanted my MOMMY more. After a long and crowded flight to Frankfurt, my nerves did not ease and the urge to burst into tears every 2 seconds stayed. When I finally arrived in London and was in one of those cool Black Cabs, I felt a little excited. Much to my relief the dorm room was clean and secure enough. However the dawning of ALONE-ness remained and once again the tears began. Talking to my At's for ages made me feel a little better, but I couldn't shake my homesick-ness. My sis was quick to point out that I was still jet lagged, and that my emotions still on a rollercoaster because of the chaotic four weeks in the Philippines. I promised to head to bed early in hope to sleep off this mood.   Speaking to my sis early the next morning, I sounded a little better and I had a day planned. EXPLORE, that will surely snap me out of my FUNK. So I visited the awesome St Paul's Cathedral, and rode the red bus. I would love to say that it made me feel better, it did, but only a little. Mostly I wished that my family were with me as I checked out the cool sceneries. After a few hours I had finally had enough and headed for home. What's to be my home for the next 3 weeks.  Tired of moping around, not exactly knowing what to do next I decided to walk around the vicinity of the dorm rooms, in hope to find a job. Like it was ever going to be that simple...I walked around, got a few numbers, and at one of my last stops I struck it lucky. Though there were no positions available in that company, I met a lady who was incredibly nice and was nice enough to talk me through a few options. She gave me a few names, and she even called a couple of agencies to ask them for procedures on my behalf. For the first time since I arrived, I thought I was making some headway in my inward battle of being homesick.   I talked to my sis and told her about my discovery for the day, and agreed that it was a good thing. I still felt homesick, and the tears came again while we talked, but I felt better after hanging up the phone. Slowly I am learning to take each day as it comes. That as scary as this is, I can get through it. That as much as I would like to head for home now, I know deep down I'm not ready to go.  That night when my Mom called me, I could speak to her without bursting into tears, which was a biggie!  I knew this was going to be a challenge, I just under-estimated the emotional challenge. I realise just how much I am reliant to those I love. Not just for practical stuff, but for emotional stuff. I miss my sis, mom, and bro's hugs. I miss being able to hug them and jump all over them, as a youngest always does.   I wanted a place with no safety nets, and I got it. Though I have to say without my sister as my lifeline via phone, I would be on a plane back right now...well maybe not, but it sure is tempting at times.   I know once job security is on hand, a place to stay is definite, and I've made a few friends, it will be easier. At this point, each day is getting easier. All I can do is take in one day at a time.  Ann pointed out the reason why I am in such a loss is because I am such a PLANNER, and I have set out in my mind how it should be, and because it isn't. I'm finding it difficult. It's true. I assumed because I have wanted this for so long, that I would be excited, and when I wasn't, I fell apart. I hate that I am not as excited as I wanted to be. That I'm scared more that I am excited.   But only time will tell. I have a committment with myself to stick it out till at least November. Till I have to be home for Mer's wedding. To give myself those four months to really give it my best shot, and decide from there what to do. Until then I am just praying to survive each day without bursting into tears. It's disappointing that I am this emotional about it, and that it's taking ages to shake off, but I guess once I settle down in my own time, I'll be able to look at this in a more non-emotional kind of way. Hopefully a week from now I can chuckle at my SAD entry.   Must go, look for jobs and accomodation, make new friends. =) I hope everyone is well. You're all often in my thoughts. I miss you all very much.  Love Much Lis/Cookster

      Greetings all. It's 5:09am (Philippine Time) and I am sitting here at the hotel, wide awake! (Geez Banan, those bottomless ICED TEA does wonders!)  I'm not quite sure when I last posted, or what I posted. This past week has passed in much of a blur. More time with family, shopping, so on and so forth.  Oh my gosh! Before I forget, my brother, Mom and I experienced something incredibly hillarious on Monday night. We caught a cab to the hotel, which isn't a biggie, however we managed to get the worst one. When I say worst I am not by any means aiming at the driver or his driving skills, but at his vehicle. The moment our butts hit the seat we thought UH OH! Our worst fears were confirmed by the rattling noise it made as it drove on. It was like it had not only one screw loose, but many. It felt like it was being held together by elastic bands. We honestly did not breathe the whole time. My Kuy and I were messaging each other via phone. Him from the front of the cab and I at the back. (At P1.00 it was doable) The conversation went on as follows.  Kie/Lis: "Um, am I the only one who has major doubts on our making it back in this heap? I'm refraining from breathing in fear it'll collapse and we would have to walk home."  Kuy: "I have the same concerns."  (Meanwhile the cars stops. It makes that sad coughing sounds as he tries to start her up again to no avail. He picks up a screwdriver and starts to head out the door, but attempts one more time. Alleliua it starts. Texting begins again...)  Kie/Lis: "Dammit Kuy! I told you not to breathe!"  Kuy: "Wait till I fart!"  After awhile we finally arrived at the hotel and though the ride only came to P87.00, my mother hands him P200 with the parting words of...  "Have it, have it all..."   We rushed to get out of the cab in fear it would just fall apart as it had come to a halt. It was hillarious, I have to say we were in hysterics for quite some time, and it still cracks us up.  Tonight we had our little get together to say goodbyes. It was pretty much full attendance by the while clan, nieces and nephews included. And no...I didn't cry. Though I have to say when I was saying goodbye to my Ate Ma, I welled up a little.   Ate Ma, has been my Ate Ma for as long as I can remember. When I was growing up we saw her the most, and I have grown up loving her as my sister. Now she's married and with kids, it's still the same. Though we can't sleep in the same bed any more, I can't drag her to wherever I am, she's still my Ate Ma, hence the welling up as we said our goodnight. *sigh*  I can't believe it's here. In about 12 hours...since it's about 5:30, I'll be inside the airport, ALONE. Unfortunately they don't allow loitering as they do at Sydney Airport. Which is probably a plus, since I will probably be inconsolable. I have a fresh batch of letters and cards to read. I sorta didn't really pass the memory book around.   London here I comes! yIKES! I'll let you guys know how I go once I get there. Till then, take care and Peace out!  PS. I haven't read emails yet and will do once I get a chance. The best way to get in contact with me, once I leave here (instantenously) is via text. +61410583784

      Tuesday 15th June 2004 – 12:15AM  Firstly, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BIPO!!!! You’d be pleased to know that I have purposely forgotten just how old you are…even though I know what year you were born and all that. That’s my present for you this year. I hope you got my birthday message via text. If not, HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! My wish for you remains as it was from the first moment we met and that is may nothing but the very best come your way! Your presence in my life has brought much by its mere existence. You have been a vital part of my growth these last few years, your support, encouragement, your annoying errrr endearing psycho analysis for every stage of my progression, or in some cases REGRESSION! This is a mere thank you and reminder of your special place in my life. – Like that scar you get when you hurt yourself, and it’s there to remind you constantly of its annoying existence. Hehe. Just kidding!!!  As previously posted, I stayed the whole week with my cousins in Quezon City, and I had a blast just hanging out with them. EATING, SLEEPING, EATING, SLEEPING!!! A lot of LAUGHING! It was great! Most of my cousins were home therefore we got the chance to hang out. Talking and cracking up during meal times. I was also glad to spend some time with my Tita Mariely.   I missed my Tita Nette, because she was my companion in San Pablo. Not to mention Art, but he got busy….which was alright, I spent the first week with Art so that I have had the time with him. That and I know he has been making sure we actually spend some time together. I am hoping to see him tomorrow.  On Friday I was dropped off at Sta Mesa (thanks for the lift Kuya Jet) to spend time with my other cousins in San Pablo where I got to spend some quality time with my cousins Ate Ma, Ate Cita, and Ate Ella. Not to mention my nieces and nephew. It was so good to spend some time with them. In my trips home, I usually see them the least and I am glad I got the opportunity to spend time with them. My nieces and I were up pretty late on Saturday night just talking, which is one of my favourite memories of this trip. I can’t believe how big they have gotten and how fast time is passing. Excuse the nostalgia. Look the last time I saw them they were flower girls for one of my cousin’s wedding okay! On Sunday they took me with them to Tagaytay to visit their first cousins (on the other side), it was a good day trip. The view was excellent on the drive up (the parts that I saw, because I was admittedly asleep for a good portion of the trip!) After a lot of EATING we went for a drive to explore Tagaytay. We checked out the sights, the kids went to the zoo, then we headed home.   I was dropped off at Quezon City again so that I could pack up my stuff for my move to the hotel the following day with my Mom and Kuy! That night we were all up with my Aunt and Uncle hacking into an extremely LARGE pizza. All my cousins were home, and we sat around the HUGE pizza box stuffing our faces in. I told you guys this trip is like one huge FOOD FEST!  I spent most of Monday lazing around with Jet and Sol till I had to get ready to pick up my Ma and Bro….which I was extremely looking forward to. When we finally got to the airport, it not only rained but it POURED!!! Let’s just say it didn’t do much for my growing reputation of always being followed by rain and thunderstorms. The airport actually lost power at one stage. It was sooo bad! Anyways after an hour of waiting at the airport they finally came. It was great to see them again. We had dinner with Tito Pepe, Tita Mariely, Ate Ma, and Papa Lon at Max’s.  The hotel room fell a lil short on the whole 5 star thing, but it’s alright. The Westin Philippine Plaza was a little disappointing. The service ain’t all that, the fridge keeps dying, and I can swear that I have been bitten by mosquitoes more in this hotel room than anywhere else in my last two weeks and a half.   Today we had lunch with Tita Rory and Co. From there we shopped for the rest of the day before heading over to dinner at the Oconer’s which was fun as always. Now we’re back here at the hotel where both my Mom and brother has passed out from the exhaustion of our day.   Anyways…I’m not far behind so I’ll sign off. I hope to post this later. Till next time. Hope all is good. Take care… Peace out!!!

      Hi All...  Well it's only a few more days and it's time for me to head on over to LONDON! OH MY GOSH! How time has flown by so fast. I can't say I have done all that much, but I have had the pleasure of spending a lot of time with some of my cousins. Who are hillarious. I'm going to miss you Ate Nelle and Ate Sol. I laugh so much when I'm at your house.   This weekend that has just passed we as a whole CLAN (with the exception of Art and Ems)went to Subic. We left very early Saturday morning, like 6am. We visited the Zoo at Subic, and headed over to the houses we rented to pass out. We had three houses for the 35 people who came for the reunion.   We ate a lot and hung around. Karaoke was had...enough said. We headed home around noon, did the whole lunch thing, and the long drive home preceeded by a huge dinner.   In case I haven't thanked my Posse friends for their voice tape, thank you. It was HILLARIOUS!!!Nice rendition of 'I Can' it had me in tears... of laughter mostly. Hehe.   Anyways... I'm at a mall doing this so I best sign off. Hopefully I will be able to log on once more before I go. If not, I'll catch you guys from the other side.   Take care and Love lots!!!

      I had such a long entry and I can't use it! GRRRRR!!!! If onlymy short term memory was useful huh?  Anyways...I spent most of last week with the Oconer Clan and I had a blast with my cousins and Aunt. They're soooo funny.  The weekend was spent in Sta Mesa with my other cousins, nieces and nephews. Whom I have to say are the one of teh cutest bunch of kids I have ever met...and no I am not biased at all.  My Mommy and Kuya are finally here and we are now at the Westin Hotel for the duration.   I can't believe that I have less than two weeks to go. Am I ready? Heck no! At the same time I am getting more and more excited.  Having my Mom and Kuy here make me less homesick, but I still miss everyone so much.  Thank you to the Posse for my voicetape. I have yet to listen to it. I need to see if anyone still has a walkman.  Val, how's your first week of work?? Hope it's all good. As for everyone who's been e-mailing. I have just gotten them and I will reply ASAP. Unfortunately I am accessing e-mail at hotel rates and even though the conversation ain't that bad for an hourly rate, well, there's london to think about...hehe!  This weekend we're going to Suibc with the WHOLE Napiza clan, and I can't wait to see the rest of the family.   Well I can't think under pressure so I'm going to go. Hope everyone's well and hopefully I can post the other entry, which is a lot more informative than this.   Peace out y'all!!! MuWAHHHH!!!

      It feels like I have done nothing but eat these last two weeks. The sight or mere mention of food has me nauseous. Breakfast, shortly followed by lunch, shortly followed by SNACK, shortly followed by dinner...and there is always midnight snack somewhere in the midst! Oh my gosh! Words can't express!  First and foremost...before I forget, and I most probably will! CONGRATULATIONS to VAL, on her very 1st job in S-Y-D-N-E-Y! Congratulations girl, I knew it wouldn't be long. She'll be in Circular Quay, working with Captain Cook Cruises. LUCY (Jeswina), you and Val can do lunch now. Since you're both only a stones throw away from the Rocks. Take her to the Candy Kitchen.   I'm here at Sta Mesa spending time with my nieces and nephews. It's been fun. EXHAUSTING, but fun. Tomorrow we're going to Tagaytay for the day, which will be good. I'll be taking Pics for sure. Will send once I can.  My Mommy and Kuy arrives on Monday! Yay!!! I can't wait! I miss everyone so much already! Especially my Ats of course! We had our phone fix the other day and I think in the end it made us sadder. Not to mention she HAD to point out that I only had two weeks to go before I go....now how rude was that? Bursting my bubble of denial.   Anyways...I've had a mental breakdown and I don't know what else to write...so with that goodbye all.   Take care...MWAH!!!

      You know what's more frustrating than the never ending rain and on going traffic? Going shopping when you are fully aware that you CANNOT shop! I mean I've had to bring my whole life with me in a backpack! Where am I supposed to squeeze in the shopping I so want to do! Oh well...I'm doing well so far. It's like a 12 step program at the moment...more like 3 steps.   On Sunday I was picked up by my Tita Amor and Kuya Chad. We went to visit one of my many nieces in Alabang, Mikah, who like the other nieces and nephews, are incredibly adorable and cute...and no that is not biased opinion.   From there we hung around the mall, (MALLS MALLS MALLS) watched a movie (AGAIN) and they dropped me off to Quezon City to be with my other cousins. It has been fun. My cousins are home so I get to spend some time with them. Unfortunately I am proving to be a distraction to my cousin Sol who is studying for her MEDICAL BOARD EXAMS. Yesterday we went to...are you ready for this??? THE MALL, and watched a movie. We watched SHREK2 and it was hillarious. It gave the first one a run for its money, but I still love the first one for sentimental reasons. Hehe...  Today my cousins played Badminton, which is really big around here. We were there for like 3 hours. It was pretty fun...and all I did was watch in the sidelines. I also got to meet my Kuya Joel's girlfriend Noreen, who was extremely nice. After lunch my cousins and I went to Greenhills (another mall) with my Aunt, and I am EXHAUSTED!!! I think I'm over MALLS and SHOPPING. I'm sure it'll be different when my Mom gets here. Nothing like shopping with Mommy.   On Friday I'll be heading over to Sta Mesa to spend time with my other cousins. Talk about busy schedule....anyways....I miss everyone!!!  Talk soon.... Take care... Peace out!!! MWAHHHHH!!!!

      Today after dinner, my cousins Art, Ems, Ate Meanne, Kuya PeeJay, Jayvee (future cousin in-law) *aherm* and I went to a BAR-ish place around here. It's like a stone's throw away. It's actually a KARAOKE bar...now before you guys start rolling your eyes and laughing, I will remind you San Pablo is not Manile and there is a limited number of places one can really hang out.   Anyways, before I lose all train of thought. It's called Q5, and Art had been promising to take me there since my arrival, since Ate Meanne, Art and I have a history with Karaoke's...I so am not going into detail. Tonight we went after dinner and had a blast.   Ate Meanne, Ems and I ended up being dubbed as DoReMi, since we sang together mostly. Certain songs will haunt me forever. It was such a good night. It was just fun to hang out, talk and laugh.   I can't believe a whole week has passed since I left Philippine/Europe bound. I miss my family and my friends. I don't remember much in those last days. All I know is that I did a lot of cramming. Trying to squeeze everyone in, making sure I at least saw everyone. Even if it were briefly. All I remember is feeling a lot harassed with last minute things I had to do, worrying about things I may not have done.   It's hard to believe that was a week ago. How time flies. Soon I'll be off to London....YIKES...till then I have every intention of making the most of my time here. Spending time with my cousins, especially those who've made such an effort to be with me.   Anyways...seeing as it is after 4am...I'm going to attempt SLEEP. Gnight!

      After what seems like forever, I am finally online. It feels so weird not to have that constant contact. Better get used to it I guess. I am here in San Pablo, with the Arambulo's. Having a great time with my 2 year old Godchild Gelo, who gives CHEEKY a whole new meaning.  Yesterday Art, Tita Nette (Aunt), and I went to Alabang and had our very own Movie Marathon. We watched "All my Life" and Harry Potter - The Prisoner of Azkaban. Mut, you'll like this movie.  Today was spent recuperating and hanging out with Gelo. I'm not sure what the next couple of days entails but I'll be in Manila early next week to hang out with my other cousins in Quezon City. I can't believe that it's almost been a week since I left. Anyways... more later. Take care everyone! Hugs and Bubbles!

      Hi all!!! It’s Sunday 30th May 2004! Day one of this trek shall we call it. Hmmm. I’m not sure when I will be able to BLOG this so I will just keep each entry dated and BLOG the minute I get a chance. Anyways…after a very emotional goodbye at the airport, I boarded the plane puffy eyed and almost inconsolable…that moment I kept saying that I hadn’t reached because I was numb, well let’s just say I reached that point at the airport. Blubbering mess I was, I was. Arghhhh!!! I miss my broadband! Well Kuya’s broadband. It’s Tuesday (I think), 1st June 2004. I still haven’t been able to log on to check my e-mail and BLOG. Not that I have been writing much. My bad! I hope everyone’s well.  It’s been a good few days. After getting picked up at the airport by the whole Arambulo clan, including my cute inaanak (godchild) Gelo. He’s sooo cute. Anyways, I’m drifting off the point…like I had one…After dinner we headed over to my other Aunt’s house in Quezon City where I saw all my Oconer cousins. My Ate Alma and Kuya Lon were also there with my other gorgeous godchild Angel. At, she’s soooo cute! It’s like looking back at old photos. Lilo! Except she’s tall and skinny.  I digress again. Sunday was spent in the Van. Literally. You gotta love the traffic around here. We were stuck in the car for about a total of 5-6 hours. No exaggeration.  At the end we turned back around and headed home. By the time we got home, Gelo, who has been sussing me out since my arrival finally gave in and decided I was a new playmate. So by Sunday night he was following me around. We’ve been playing ever since.  Yesterday I spent most of it with Art. We headed for Manila at 4:30am. In sheer hope that we beat the traffic, unfortunately there was yet another accident blocking the roads. So Finally at 7ish we were having breakfast and McDonalds. In nothing less than my GYM clothes. Most of you would remember what that look would entail. Hey! To my defense we were supposed to go from one house to another where I was to resume my sleep. It’s a good thing I actually changed out of my pyjamas. Not that I really cared, I mean like who was going to see me.  After breakfast my cousin Art dropped Ems and I off at hers and Mela’s condo apartment, where we found Mela fast asleep. After exchanging pleasantries, we both passed out again. Late morning Art came to pick me up. We went to Makati Med to drop stuff off and say hi to Tita Rory and Tita Glo. From there we headed for Alabang Town Centre….big big big big mall. We had lunch at Fridays. YUM YUM! Then while Art checked into work for about an hour I went out on a mission to work on Mer’s invite. When that was done Art played hooky for the rest of the day and we watched a movie. We ended up watching “The day after tomorrow”, which was alright. What’s a ride home without a trip to Starbucks and major traffic. It took us more than 2 hours to get home. Which was okay, Art and I had a blast in the car. He made me laugh so hard.  Today we have plans on visiting Duty Free after lunch. From there we’re going to watch ‘All my life’ with Aga Mulach! I’ll tell you all about it Banans! Hopefully the traffic won’t be so bad. Sitting in a car for long periods of time has become somewhat an acquired taste. Now that I’m here the thought of “Hey I’m not going home after this” is SLOWLY sinking in. I mean WOW. This is where I say my goodbyes. After this trip, I’ll be going to another country, where I know no one. YIKES! However, in saying that, I am still looking forward to it. The adventure it holds.  Oh well. I think that’s it for me for the time being. It’s frustrating to be in front of a PC and not be able to surf, or check my e-mail. Regards to all. Take care! Peace out! Nanu nanu!  PS…Big Hugs and Kisses to my Inaanaks, Miss Cheeky Aleissa and Ashlee Rose! Mwahhhh!!! Ninang misses you!

      It's so hard to believe that it has been four weeks exactly to this day that I arrived in London. Scared, freaked out and ready to go home. Now after four weeks, though I still miss my family and friends, I am settled down. Still looking for a job and a permanent place to stay, but settled as one can get in such circusmtances.  I am back here at the job centre surfing the net for jobs and what not. AGAIN! I am so OVER interviews, but what can one do.  I spent the weekend hanging out with Crys (Christina), it was her last weekend in London, and Isabelle was pre-occupied with a visit from Ludavic her beau from France. So we were left to explore on our own....by BUS of course. Hehe.  We tried M.Tussauds but it was too expensive so we went shopping instead. Then on Sunday we went to Hyde Park to visit the memorial...what a waste of time and money that was. It was like a circle shaped slab of concrete. So much for my appreciation in art...hey to my defense if there's art to appreciate, I will appreciate it. Unfortunately there was no Art quality with regards to this memorial. The money would have served better being donated to her favourite charity. Not to mention there was no water because apparently it wasn't French Diplomat Clumsiness Friendly. A French Diplomat slipped and resulted to it being shut down for investigations. Ho hum! It's almost funny. I took pictures of the signs they had for my own amusement.   Anyways...not much to report...Just that I'm sitting in front of the PC again surfing for jobs. Probably be doing the same thing tomorrow.   Hope you're all good... love lots... MUWAHHHH!!!!

      &nbsp;  Hmm, I had such big plans for today but they got somewhat sidetracked as I got into one of my new books and couldn’t put it down. MY BAD!!! So instead of seeing Dicken’s house today as planned, I’m here at the Goswell Centre filling in applications forms for a job. Because I was at the dorm I received a call to come down, fill in some forms for a hospital switchboard position. Since I spent the whole morning reading, I figured I may as well do some work (job hunt work) so tomorrow can be spent completely EXPLORING.  &nbsp;  My birthday turned out to be less depressing than what I had feared it to be. Being my very first birthday ALONE, it was inevitable that I be somewhat melodramatic, fearing the worst. I woke up after only a couple of hours sleep to a note tacked on my door from Isabelle wishing me a Happy Birthday, when I returned from my bathroom break Christina had also added her best wishes on the note. They’re cute. I met them after my Movie Marathon back at the dorm, and we headed out to grab our Pizzas. I blew out a cake that was made from a tower of muffins. It was fun. I celebrated the night with Isabelle, Christina and Lorena, whom I’ve only met recently but she has become a great addition to our lil community.  &nbsp;  As previously BLOGGED, I spent the day watching movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Prince and Me. Mean girls was funny, but I really liked the Prince and Me. I guess that is the hopeless romantic in me. Not to mention my new found appreciation for Julia Stiles, though I liked her before, it was truly awesome to see her in action in Oleanna.  &nbsp;  Yesterday morning I had my interview at the Waldorf Hilton, which was definitely la di dah! I want a job there!!! The position sounds promising, however the Human Resources chick thinks I would be better at this team leader role and will look into it further for me. She promised to get back to me by tomorrow at the very latest. As for the mortgage job, I’m still waiting for an answer. I’m supposed to know something by the end of the week also.  &nbsp;  When I got back from Waldorf I had a phone call from Shordiff, the guy organising the mortgage job for me, he calls like three times a day. When I had mentioned this to Eileen (the resident receptionist aka Mother Hen) and added that I had to drop off a copy of my Working Visa, she grew worried and feared he was just wanting to meet me in a dark alley somewhere. LOL. No kidding she did. She demanded to have the address I was headed to as well as my mobile number. What time I was supposed to be there and what not. Then promised she would call me an hour after the designated time I was supposed to be there. I was highly amused but deeply touched at, in her words, ‘Mumsi-ness’, I guess after four weeks of seeing me every day and chatting every day, not to mention seeing what a wreck I was in the beginning, she adopted me as some form of a puppy needing looking after. Needless to say she sighed with relief as I walked through residence doors.  &nbsp;  After getting changed out of the interview pointy shoes I headed off to Oxford Street for some birthday shopping. I ended up with new shoes for the bargain price of £30. It’s white and pink, my new favourite colour. I also got a belt because my jeans are getting embarrassing in terms of walking and sliding down. I bought new shorts. Oh but my best purchase was at Harrods on Sunday. They were having a massive sale, regardless I still couldn’t afford a thing, however we wandered around the perfume section and found that they were definitely on sale. I ended up with Issey Miyake (the round ball one that I had), a big size, with lotion and bath gel, for…. £17. How awesome is that. Even after you times it by 3 it’s less expensive than buying it there.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow I’m going to explore all of Tower of London or check out Charles Dickens and Thomas Carlyle’s house, which is what I was going to do today. Oh well, we’ll see. Hope all is well with everyone. Love lots… muwahhhhhh!!!

      Happy Birthday to meeeeeeee!!! Okay, I got that out of my system! Hehe. Well at quarter to midnight last night I received my very first phone call from Ate Grace. Followed closely by Winnie whom for a moment I was ready to disown because I thought she had forgotten. Then my Ats called, my Mom, my Aunty Esty. So safe to say that I didn't get much sleep last night. I had intended to go to Mass this morning but I woke up late, and by the time I would get to church the mass would be finished....however I went last night just in case I couldn't get there today. &nbsp; I had brunch at Mickey D's no less. Sad isn't it? Come all this way and eat McDonalds for your birthday? Oh well. I had no plans for today except loiter around, maybe shop. I've been wanting to watch a couple of movies and I thought why not today. It's half price and it's probably the only time I'll get to do it, so here I am having my very own movie marathon. Look, as sad as it may sound, it's fun. I haven't seen TV for like four weeks so it's a TREAT to see a big screen. I watched The Prince and Me, and as Ate Grace said it would be, it was a really cute, kilig movie.&nbsp; I'm killing time before the next movie. I might watch Mean Girls. Ann and Jes said it was good.  &nbsp; Afterwards I'm meeting the girls back at the dorm for a PIZZA night. I haven't had pizza since Phils so I'm definitely looking forward it.&nbsp; I'm enjoying the day. It's definitely different than normal, but hey I came to London for new experiences right? &nbsp; On Friday I went to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre to watch a matinee of Romeo and Juliet, it was really good. Aside from the whole standing for three hours thing. Towards the end I found myself muttering 'die already, die die already!' Afterwards I hung out at Leicester Square, which has become one of my favourite hangouts. Wandering around and what not. &nbsp; Saturday was a killer day. We woke early to explore. Isabelle, Christina and myself. We left at 9:30am, headed for Whitechapel markets....by foot. Of course it rained, and of course we didn't have an umbrella, therefore I had to invest in one. Needless to say as soon as I did, the sun came out and it became a sunny day. Which was good because we went to see the Tower Bridge, we didn't go into the Tower of London because we wanted the whole day to do it.  &nbsp; We headed home (by foot) for lunch where we rested for about an hour, before heading over to Camden Markets....by foot. Are you guys getting the picture? We arrived home about 8:00 and yes, aside from the lunch break, the rest of the time was spent WALKING. We were literally DEAD and&nbsp;DELIRIOUS by the time we made it to the residency. &nbsp;We SLOWLY got dinner ready, after which I took my shower and collapsed on my bed.  &nbsp; The next day we had plans on going to Harrods and visit Hyde park, but we got only as far as Harrods because we got separated. From there Christina and I walked (slowly - still suffering from the previous day's hike) around Oxford Street. When we were too tired we called it quits. I headed for Hillsong, and she headed for the residency. When I finished at Hillsong I went to Ate Fe and Kuya Dodie's to pick up my mail. &nbsp; Yesterday I had an interview with the Chelsea Building Society and it sounds promising, but we'll see. I'm not counting my chickens yet. I have an interview at the WALDORF hotel tomorrow....yeah it's a little LA DI DAH! So hopefully one of these interviews will materialize into a job. I have extended my stay in the dorm, I figured, job first accomodation later, just so I knew where to look for a place. Ate Fe's place will remain my mailing address, no matter where I move to.  &nbsp; Thanks to everybody who messaged me for my birthday. It meant a great deal to hear from you guys. Vlad and Val sorry I missed your call. Thanks for calling though. I miss you guys heaps also!  &nbsp; Ummm...that pretty much covers it.&nbsp; I'll keep everyone posted with latest happenings....job wise, accomodation wise, sam wise....sorry, I was on a roll there. All Jeswina's fault. She started it. Anyways... thanks again for the greetings and for remembering me on my birthday. It feels weird because it doesn't feel and different from any other day....I guess I am getting old huh?  &nbsp; Oh well...gotta go...the clock ticks. Take care... love lots... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      After a frustrating day...yet another. The afternoon has been good. After preparing and getting ready for this STUPID interview that JERK WONDER decided to cancel half an hour before it began on Monday, I arrived there after an hour on the bus (3 buses later) at Paddington only to be told by Manners Challenged Boy Wonder that he couldn't do the interview. I was so close to punching him in the face and not feel any qualms about it. I was warned of RUDENESS in this place but that was UNBELIEVABLE. He held no remorse for the huge INCONVENIENCE. I was overwhelmed with   "Oh why I oughta..." before punching him in the face. GRRRRR!!!!   Anyways...I went back to the dorm where Eileen from reception pretty much got as wound up as I did when I told her about it. (I am in and out of that place so often that I have gotten familiarized with the staff) So I went back upstairs and got changed out of my 'proper clothes' and into my unironed (don't tell my mother) cargo pants, shirt and jacket and headed for Leicester Square with every intention of making the day better by wtaching a play that I really wanted to see called Oleanna. I went to Leicester Square and lined up in one of those half price places and got a really good seat for half the price. I was syked. So after my Happy Meal (which I was craving for) I headed over to a CHEAPO internet cafe to check my e-mail for details on upcoming interviews....I have two tomorrow.   I digress...the play was AWESOME. Julia Stiles was really good and I loved it enough to look for the play at a book store once I have finished My Life - Bill Clinton which I am over half way to finishing. Seeing the play kind of reminded me of why I'm here. To  see and do things, I can't necessarily do if I am back home. I have plenty of others I want to see. Like We will rock you, Fame, When Harry met Sally, Phantom (again), Mamma Mia (again) and the girls want to see Les Mis but I don't know if I can justify seeing it for like the fourth time. Twice in Sydney, and once in Broadway. We'll see how the budget is.   I had a phone interview today which I am currently waiting it's results. I felt my phone buzzing in my pocket during the play and I missed it...obviously!  In the last couple of days. The last 24hours in particular I have began to question whether or not I could really do this, and I gotta tell you, some days are so frustrating that I think packing it up, traveling the remaining days may be a good idea. But I decided I'm not ready to accept defeat just yet. I am however looking into checkking out France for a weekend just to get a taste of traveling. I have to make a decision by next week. If nothing looks promising, I may just jump on a train and travel with what I got. Then come back and try it all over again. We'll see.   Well, tomorrow is another day. I have another interview with another Recruitment Agency, hopefully they're a lot more helpful than the last one, instead of just being a bunch of snooty people. Then afterwards I have an interview with a Marketing Campaign, which sounds interesting...we'll see what that entails.   Thanks for reading my babbles and what not. Hope all is well with everyone.  Take care and Love much...

      Greetings and Hi de ho...   Week three of London. The weather, still bites, but you know. You make do with what you got. After if-ing and ahh-ing about whether or not I should venture out on Saturday, because of the lovely weather, Christina and I bravely ventured out after lunch. We headed for the ever famous Portobello Markets in Notting Hill. I was so syked, I get to see where they shot Notting Hill. I was experiencing flaskbacks of Julia Roberts standing in front of Hugh Grant,   "I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to lover her..."   Was repeating itself over and over again in my head. After a log bus ride there we finally arrived. We walked up and down, to no avail. Finally we asked and I was devastated to find out that not only does the famous Travel Bookshop NOT EXIST. They had three locations to shoot the one scene. It totally killed it for me. We got to stand in front of the blue door, which is now black. Needless to say I felt a little jipped by the experience, but oh well... HOLLYWOOD right?  After we headed home, cooked dinner and got ready to go out. My first night out in London. Christina and I met with a couple of her Italian friends and we ended up at a club in Camden. The music wasn't bad, and it was a pretty good couple of hours. The trek home was an experience to remember. There was no direct buses back to our end of London...of course. So after a lot of walking trying to look for a suitable bus stop to get us home, we finally got there. We arrived just before 3am.  Sunday was spent reading and pretty much just bumming out. I had a migraine so I was trying to sleep it off. That evening I went to Hillsong London which was pretty cool. It made me miss my IPOD more because I didn't have access to my Hillsong stuff.   Monday turned out to be a GARFIELD 'I hate Mondays' day. The interview sort of flopped. They were after someone with UK experience, blah blah. The second interview decided to postpone it half an hour before it started...I was so NOT happy!   I quickly went home, got changed, and tried to make it for the 5:30pm Mass at Westminister Cathedral. I barely made it. Afterwards I went to Ate Fe and Kuya Dodie's for my mail. Where I was fed and sent home with a full tummy.   Today was laundry day. So that pretty much killed my morning, but its always good to have clean clothes...hehe...This afternoon I've gone back to job hunting and so forth. I'll be looking at a flat in Chelsea this afternoon, so we'll see.   Anyways, that's about it for me. Hope everyone is well. Peace out! Nanu nanu!

      Today I had not much planned. If anything I just wanted to stay in teh dorm, read, sleep, and laze about. I was waiting for phone calls for interviews and have finally reached the not caring stage. Well, the less STRESSED out stage. After my Mom's phone call this morning, instead of getting ready to go out, I went back to bed and read, played with my faithful gameboy, (which I know my Ate Nelle, Ate Sol and Kuya Jet are missing - more than they're missing me) I received a text message from Trisha aka Bot-Bot, who's my childhood friend. She was in London, just arrived yesterday from Malta and she is only here for a week or so. Anyways...we agreed to meet for an early lunch at Leicester Square (I swear everytime I am anywhere somewhat familiar I feel like I am playing Monopoly)...I digress...Well after messaging her back I uncharacteristically fell asleep again. Oooops!! By the time I woke up it was like 10:40 and we were meeting at 11:30am. After a quick shower and three bus changes later I made it. She looked EXACTLY the same. She was EXACTLY the same. It was good. We talked like no time had passed. Even if it has been about 7 years since we had last seen each other. It was so nice to have a familiar face.  Trish was one of my very first friends. We are family friends. When we arrived in Asutralia, they arrived shortly after. Her family, mine and another (Aimee's) spent almost every weekend together for the next decade. Our families know each other's family dramas. It was like growing up with extra cousins, and as I look back on our childhood, the fun times includes sleepovers, dancing around in front of the TV while Trish introduced us to the latest dance moves of YTT! SAD!!! The mention of Martika will always make me chuckle.   Anyways after lunch we walked about for a little while and headed off to Oxford Street for some window shopping. When I said that I hadn't even been to Harrods, we headed for Knightsbridge...so I have not only seen Harrods, I also got to check out the ring that Dodi got Diana.   We headed for home afterwards and agreed to keep in touch via text messages. As well as spending a good day out I received a few calls regarding job interviews so I am looking forward to those. I have one tomorrow and two on Monday. This weekend I hope to look for places to live.   Hmmm...London is definitely growing on me. I'm loving it. I hope all is well with everyone. I still miss you all very much. Take care and Love much... MWAH!!!

      At 1:30 early this morning, we were rudely awakened by an LOUD, ANNOYING alarm. For a moment I thought I was back home and I had set my alarm for an ungodly hour wake up call to finish deadline, or assignment. Despite how along ago I had graduated. The noise was constant, and irritating. I reluctantly ducked my head out of my door to find Christina and Isabel's head hanging out to with the same confused and dumbfounded expression as I had on mine. As other doors flew open in annoyance, we glanced at each other and decided to head downstairs. There could be a fire. As we headed down however people were headed up, so we went back to the rooms only to be advised to leave the building immediately. I looked down at my flattering attire of 3/4 pyjama pants and old T-shirt, shrugged followed with a sigh. I picked up my jacket and headed down the stairs with the girls. As soon as we got outside I felt the breeze and realised I was somewhat under dressed for the summer evening. WELCOME to LONDON!!! Grrr!!! Of course when one is dressed ever so daggy, with her hair standing up in so many directions, she runs into good looking tenants of the dorm, whom she never runs into when she's dressed and looking somewhat presentable. *sigh* Isn't that always the case. So we stood around for a little while, socialised with neighbours we have never met, nor known existed. If we weren't so tired and in shock, the three fire trucks waiting outside the building would have been alarming. But it seems all it was, was a FALSE ALARM...well that's what they said last night, but today we found out that someone had accidently set fire (a small one) on the fifth floor. Comforting isn't it? After the dramas we were able to go back upstairs, and needless to say, I could no longer sleep. GRRR!!!  Today was a pretty laid back day. I headed for the Job Centre again, and though the systems were up and running, it was packed and they had no staff to assist. So I left, dropped off applications and headed for the dorm. Upon arriving I made my lunch, read and had it. Now I'm here, in yet another Internet Cafe, surfing for accomodation and Jobs. After over an hour my eyes are becoming blurry so I thought I'd post last night's festivities.   Tonight shall be a quiet night. As usual Christina, Isabel and I will be making our low budget meals for dinner, and having it in the communal kitchen.   Hopefully tomorrow I will hear back from some of these people I keep e-mailing. Tomorrow I'll be spending the day in the phone booth ringing around for accomodation. What fun! Anyways...hope todays post brought a chuckle. It certainly was an interesting night last night.  PEACE OUT!

      I have come to the conclusion that I am having a BRANTLEY FOSTER series of moments. In saying that I realise my sister would probably be the only one who will realise what I am rambling about...If she remembers...at the tender age of 31 she's getting to be more and more forgetful.  Brantley Foster was the leading character in one of my most favourite movies of all time...The Secret of my Success. Brantley goes to NY to test out the big city and is hit with a series of dead ends. But in the end, he succeeds. I WILL TOO!  As frustrating as it is trying to go from one agency to another, it's okay. I am beginning to enjoy London. My new found friends at the dorm make the small confined space a more liveable place to be.   Christina is Italian and Isabel is French, while I am the Filipino/Australian. We make an interesting bunch. They're great to be with and because we are all away from our homes, we sort of make each other feel homey. We eat dinner together and makes plans for the following days.   London is beginning to be less scary, even exciting. So I am getting there...yesterday we attempted to brave the crowds for the F1 parade, my brother would be proud but after being squashed for almost an hour with no hopes of seeing anything, we called it quits and headed for home, where we hoped Isabel would be since she got separated.   Anyways...that's all for me. I have to run for an interview. Hope all is good with everyone.

      Well today started of with such high hopes of accomplishing many things. Opening a bank account, doing laundry, mailing my Ipod, etc etc.   Instead I have accomplished NOTHING! I left the dorm later than usual after having a great talk with Val. My Mom called this morning as per usual and miraculousy no tears were involved. My Ats and I tried to connect but my credits run out. But I spoke to her last night anyway.   Anyways...I left the dorm feeling a lot better. London didn't seem as scary anymore, now that I knew which buses to take, where to take connecting buses and so forth. I was ready to Open my bank account. I had all the necessary paperwork, etc etc. So I get to Victoria and the lady says that my supporting documents are fine, however the letter verifying my address needed to be formatted, so I called Kuya Dodie and asked if I could go there and get it fixed. So I hopped on two buses to get to Chelsea, disturbed him, got him to reformat the letter as requested and take another two buses back. I got back close to 1-ish and they informed me after all that, that one of the supporting documents were outdated, therefore I need to go back and get another one, or ask Ate Fe to write another letter, this time only under her name. Unfortunately Ate Fe was at work and won't be home till after 6 tonight. Fine dealt with that I will just come back later.   Now after mailing my Ipod and returning home, I realised I shouldn't have mailed my IPOD under normal mail. I know I know, brain flew out the window. So after talking to my sis, it was decided that I should just take the mail back. Which luckily enough you could do here. I called the people, and they were willing to hold it for me. So here I am rushing out the dorm room again...to catch the mail people. When I get to Victoria I realise that I got off a few stops before because I forgot I walked around for ages. GRRRR!!!! So here I finally am at the mail store thingy and they let me take back my Ipod. No refund therefore I got myself another (because I had bought one earlier) book of international stamps, and one hour internet as equivalent to the mailing amount. Give or take. So here I am, trying to consume it.   I am EXHAUSTED, FRUSTRATED and what not. I wasted £10 and a day. I realise I may have just saved myself the $400 I paid for my Ipod but after all the drama of the day it just sucks! Not to mention it sucks that the stupid thing just died for no reason.   Anyways....on the UP SIDE, and yes it was hard to find one... London isn't so scary anymore and little by little my nerves are settling down. I'm still worried about the job hunt and accomodation. I miss my family like mad, but I'm getting there.   Also today I went pass a recruitment agency and signed up, not to mention I dropped in an application form to a prestigious hotel. I'm hoping they're looking for admin clerical staff. If I get something around here in Victoria it'd be great, since this is around the area I would like to find a permanent place at.   Yesterday I went and met Kuya Jay's sister Ate Fe, and she and Kuya Dodie were great. They were way helpful. They also reassured me. It's not the same, but at least I don't feel quite as ALONE anymore.   When I got back to the dorm last night a few of us girls hung out at the kitchen just chatting and what not, I got back to the room after 10 which is an achievement from someone who was in bed by 7:30pm last week.   I don't think London will ever be HOME, but I am slowly getting excited at the possibilities. If only I could get a job already.   On Saturday Alison, my new friend from Adelaide, and I went to Heaver, to visit Henry VIII's castle. That turned out to be fun. Especially the train ride, for it had a very Hogwarts Express feel to it.   Anyways, I think that is my hour almost up. Imagine £4 for one hour of internet use. Talk about RIP OFF...especially when you're x by 3.   Signing off... take care and God Bless to all..  Love and Missin much, d'cookster

      Well, today is a little brighter than yesterday. Though it sort of didn't feel like it started out that way when I spoke with my Mom on the phone and was in uncontrollable tears.   I made it to my 1st Contact orientation and got all the info I need for Banking and all that. It was extremely helpful, and once I have a permanent residency I can open my bank account.   Also today while killing time at an internet cafe I met a girl who was in a similar position as to myself. We're meeting up later for coffee or whatever. It makes me feel better to have met someone. Though we live at opposite ends of London at the moment, it's still nice to know I've met a potential friend and buddy.   Though I am still pining for HOME in a major way, and still could burst into tears for no apparent reason, today's a better day.

      Well Day Six of Rome. I have seen most of the Touristy places except for the Sistine Chapel. I keep getting lost. Would help if I brought the better map, so I might do that tomorrow. Today I might check out the shopping...like I can afford to buy anything.  Yesterday I spent the day at the Colloseo. It was AWESOME. It was so good to check out each stone and what not. It was great to stand in the middle of it and look around...it was incredible. I took lots of pictures.  After the Colloseo I just explored locally. Checked out one of the major Bascilia's, which was great, then on the way home I checked out what was near....the answer was NOTHING. So it's a trip to the centre.  I am looking into flights back to London, even Paris since my return is coming from Paris, but we'll see how expensive it all is. I figured I'll see as much of Italy as I can and want to and head back in a couple of weeks to resume the job hunt, now that I have somewhat de-stressed about it.  I'm loving Italy but I can't afford to just hang here. So I am making the most of it, seeing everything I want to see and heading back.  Anyways... I best go and look for flights. Then I am outta here to continue the exploring. Take care everyone. See you soon.

      Well, that totally sucked. I just spent the last hour blogging and I lost it all! GRRRR!!! I am so annoyed.  Let's see if I can remember what I had so eloquently put in the other one.  Here I am in Rome. It's AWESOME. I love this place. I love the scenery and I cannot wait to see more.  Paloma, Julien, Anton and I ended up at the pub we went to previously. Lorena, do you remember the one we went to on Friday night? That one. We had a few drinks before heading back where we said our goodbyes. Our numbers were dwindling and it was obvious. Only hours before I had said my goodbye to Isabelle, whom like Cristina had been with me since I first arrived. It was like saying goodbye to family. However I am confident that we will see each other again, if not in Paris, definitely in Sydney. Right Isabelle? I'll wait for you and Ludavic.  Getting back to my room that night I wassomewhat nostalgic. This room that I had made into my own the last weeks, have become HOME. As close to it as I was going to get. It had been transformed from a scary small room, to mine.  At 3:45am I stood at the door and let my eyes take one last glance. From the study table where my momentos from home lived, my pictures tacked up, to the lumpy, squeeky, suspiciously unchanged bed, (well it has been changed, but the frequency remains suspicious) to the bookcase I had filled up with my toiletries, kitchen stuff and what not, to the washer basin and mirror that was too high to ever really see the extent of how badly you looked in the morning. Not to mention the suspicious hole that was directly above it. One's mind could do wonders. But anyways...  At 4:00am my Mini cab arrived promptly and I made it to Victoria in plenty of time for my 4:30am Gatwick Express. After the formalities at Gatwick I waited patiently for my plane excited at the prospect of going to Rome. Wow! Excited didn't even come close. Without any sleep from the night before, it doesn't need to be said that I passed out completely the moment I sat down on the plane. The old couple beside me were quite amused that I had managed to sleep through the chaos of the children around us.  When I arrived I was met by Grace's cousin Kuya Ferdie (another one), and not long after Annie and co arrived. After a long train ride home, and a trek uphill to the flat, we basically collapsed into a heap at the flat. Some of us, not mentioning any names *aherm* passed out till the following day. And it wasn't me. We had Pizza for dinner. Welcome to Italy!  We rose early the next morning and left early, excited for the day ahead. But first there was their trip to Greece to arrange, and unfortunately because of the frequency and length of travel to Greece, they had to leave a day early. So once all that was sqaured away we did our very own version of SPEED TOURING. Since they had to leave the following morning.  The day was awesome despite the rushing around. I loved being with them. It reminded me of the weekend away trips with my friends. Jeanette and I will always have that Espresso shot and 'only only only' to bond us for life.  First we went to the Vatican, and unfortunately the Pope wasn't around. I guess he didn't get my e-mail to meet us. Or at least wave from the window. From there we went to Piazza Navona, we tried the Sistine Chapel but it was closed by the time we got there. We then went to the Trevi Fountain, and as promised I threw 3 coins in. From the Trevi I think we went to the Pantheon. It was after the Gelato for sure but I'm not sure if that was after the Trevi. =) At the Pantheon Annie, Jeanette and I experienced another fit of the giggles. We pretty much decided we were a bad combo that way. Though to our defense, it's not our fault we see amusing things all at the same time. After the Pantheon, we went to the Spanish Steps, where we lost Dan. We didn't realise he was exactly where Annie and Jeanette had left him behind the steps. We attempted to make it to the Colloseum, but when we got there it started pouring and the sky was darkening. So after a few photos, a couple of more laughs we headed for Kuya Ferdie's for dinner. His wife Ate Len Len was extremely nice, and at the risk of making Ate Grace jealous, Arin is soooo cute. He has the roundest cheeks. It was getting late and we still had a long way home so at 10:30 we headed home. Caught the tram, then the train, then we had to change trains, at midnight we literally crawled uphill and then collapsed when we arrived home. Unfortunately for them, they were leaving early the next day, so they crashed as soon as they got there.  Saying goodbye was sad, even if we had only spent a couple of days together. I guess they were a piece of home I wasn't so ready to let go off just yet. But...cest la vie. (oops wrong country) After they left the house was like a tomb. It was so quiet.  I did a little grocery shopping, then familarized myself with my immediate surroundings. This morning I cleaned up a little and did my washing before heading over to the centre to do some local exploring. Tomorrow I want to hop on a tour bus and perhaps do the Colloseum all day on Monday. The possibilities are endless...after all I am in Roma.  I am uncertain as to how long I'll be here before heading back to London. We'll see. Cristina called me the other night and she is returning to Florence this weekend so hopefully we can meet up somewhere and catch up soon.  Anyways...best go see the outside world. Take care...  Love lots.... MUWAHHHH!!!

      Well sorta! Hehehe!  Last night I started packing for Italy, so that I could drop off my extra piece of luggage to Kuya Dodie's and Ate Fe's. It took ages!!!  The latests??? Well after saying goodbye to Cristina, her presence was certainly missed. As ours were I'm sure. Lorena, Julian, Paloma, Anton and I headed for Fabric on Farringdon about 10:30pm. It was a fun night of dancing and a lot of laughing. When we finally made it back to the residence we were all starving...however there was like a line up of people trying to check in.... at almost 4 in the morning! We stayed up for a little while in the common room before heading off into our respective rooms. I was up for awhile because the red bull part of my red bull and vodka sorta kicked in. I finally got to sleep a couple of hours before being awoken by my daily calls from my ma. I covered a possible hangover with a late night. Needless to say I fell back asleep after the conversation. Only to get up an hour or two later because Lorena and I had plans to go to Mass at Westminister Cathedral. She looked a lot better than I felt.  After mass we headed back to the residence. Lorena and the boys went to Camden Town. While I tried to catch at least another hour of zzzzz's. From there I headed for Hillsong.  That night we ended up at Shakespeare Pub again for Lorena's last dinner in London. Which was fun. Afterwards we went to the common room to watch Down to you.  Yesterday I had an interview in the morning and then I had to say good bye to Lorena. Which was sad. We're dwindling in numbers...however I am looking forward to seeing them in Italy.  This morning I found a note from Julian, and I think what's left of us will be having dinner at the Shakespeare, for my last dinner.  Lorena and I were talking about the friendships we've all built and how precious each one was. We all came from being sad to being to be leaving. However, we have all promised to keep in touch via e-mail and what not.  Anyways....best go. Hope all is well with everyone.  Baci! (how's that Lorena?)

      Well, I guess a lot has happened since my last post would be a little bit of an understatement! The past week has passed in sort of a blur. I don't remember the first bit at all. Aside from trying to spend as much time with Cristina who was leaving on the Friday, I was getting very restless. I was sick of looking for jobs, and as much as I loved London, and being able to find my way around, doing touristy things, etc...I wanted a change.  Wednesday night we spend another night in the kitchen catching up on everyone's day with Cristina, Lorena and Isabelle. Admittedly by then I was giving myself a deadline to make a decision, move on or stick around. The girls threw ideas and listened to my whinings...bless their hearts!  On Thursday I had a 2nd interview with IPG which was a promotional company, the moment they asked me to spend the whole day with one of their consultants I was suspicious. In the end I was correct as I ended up doing door to door sales in the middle of woop woop, walking (in my pointy heels no less) in an industrial area. I was like, ummmm, this isn't for me and said so by 3 I said 'this isn't for me' .... and headed home. Hey I lasted longer than the person they hired only the day before. She walked out on the 1st hour. I stuck it out for 6 and I wasn't even an employee. I just wanted to figure out how badly I wanted to work, and it wasn't that bad.  So on the way home I was feeling incredibly defeated and just racking my brain for options and I thought, stuff this...I'm going to Italy. I was going to call my cousin Ate Grace and speak to her about possible accomodation and she said that her in laws were in the Phils and the house will be empty. Hence I will be able to use it. It was like the 1st big break, I was ecstatic. Finally it felt like I made the right decision.  I leave on Wednesday 4th August to meet up with Annie in Rome! Spend a few days with her and hang in Italy till Ate Grace's in laws gets back. I can't wait. My only dilemma now is trying to pack up my life. Somehow I can't fit everything back into my suitcases. Oh boy! Space bags to the rescue.  Thursday night was Cristina's last night so Lorena, Cristina, Julian and I went out to dinner. The plan was to take Cristina to a pub for her 1st and last British meal...fish and chips! We ended up at a pub, but all they served was Italian stuff, so we had Pizza as a going away for an Italian going back to Italy. It was hillarious. We had a good night, we went back to the residency, in which Julian graciously provided Apple Strudel and Ice Cream, so we sat around the kitchen (for the millionth time) and gas bagged for hours. Yesterday I spent the day getting everything ready. Then I took Cristina to Victoria Station. Bought my plane ticket to Italy. Went to mass at Westminister Cathedral and met up with Lorena. We had dinner at Ate Fe and Kuya Dodie's, I told them about Italy, and asked if I could leave one of my luggages with them. Of course they said yes. So now I'm trying to pack up that suitcase so I can take it there either tomorrow or Tuesday, depending. When we got back to the residence Lorena, Julian, Paloma and I sought out a Pub, ended up at a good one in Angel but it got louder and louder so when we were half deaf from having to scream we headed back to the residency, and into one of our kitchens...as always. Very late we called it quits and made plans for tonight. We're heading to a club called Fabric, so that will be interesting. I was going to go to the Sound of Music Sing along thing but Allie is going away for a few days so we've postponed.  The residence doesn't seem the same without Cristina. It's so much quieter! I'm hoping to see her and Lorena when I get to Italy.  Anyways...must go. It's tooo hot in this cafe. Will write again before I go, since I have 100 minutes left of credit to use here at Costa. Hope you're all good.  Take care... Lis
