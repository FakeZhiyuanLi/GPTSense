        We have seen a lot of deaths in the past few days.  What with all the tragedies and disasters that plagued different countries in the world (the flood and landslide in Surigao and Southern Leyte respectively (Philippines), the chemical explosion in China, the bomb blasts in Israel and Iraq, the attempt to assassinate Pakistan's Pres. Musharaff, the earthquake in Iran).  The fact that all these things happened almost at the same time really scared the hell out of me.  It really made me think and ask, "Is the world coming to an end?".  And, believe me, the thought gave me the creeps and shivers.  But, despite all these things, the hopeful me still rose to the surface.  Yes, all these things happening just before the year ends gives me a light of hope- hope that all these bad things would end as the year 2003 also ends.  I hope and pray that we leave all these bad things with the year that we are about to leave behind and that the  new year  be a better, more meaningful, more prosperous and more peaceful year for all of us.   I really believe that these things happen for a reason (that only God knows) and are telling/teaching us a thing or two about life and death.  Or maybe this is God's way of reminding us that we should never forget Him, that we should pray and talk to Him more often.  Yes, maybe...    And now, even before I could recover from the shock of all the things that have been happening around the world, another tragedy happens.  A very young, good-looking actor, Miko Sotto, accidentally falls from the ninth floor of the building where he lives.  He is proclaimed dead on arrival at the hospital where he was brought to. So sad...   It is true that this may be considered a little thing compared to all the tragedies and disasters I have mentioned, but still when I try to think of the family and friends Miko left behind, this is tragedy beyond compare.  Losing a loved-one is really something that's enough to make someone go nuts! Believe me, I've been through that.  A favorite cousin died five years ago when he accidentally shot himself while playing with a gun.  Why he had that gun and why it was loaded, I still can't understand.  It was one of our family's lowest points.  And, I'd rather not talk about it now for fear of breaking down again.  In time, I might be able to really get down and talk/write about it.  Back to what happened to Miko, I was totally saddened by the sight of those who loved him cry, hug and comfort one another.  It was heart-breaking to see and listen to his mother talk about him.  Honestly, I never really liked Miko.  I mean, I didn't hate him either, it's like he's just one of those movie stars that I just let pass without really noticing.  He's a relatively new face to me.  But, his death really struck me hard.  His death made me think of my own mortality.  He was young and successful, he was good-looking, he had all the money to buy whatever he wanted, he had a happy relationship with his beautiful girlfriend, he was at the peak of his young life.  Sure, he may have had issues and problems (who doesn't?), but he had a good life.  And, all of a sudden,  Death  strikes and takes him away from the good life he lived.    This only proves that whatever or whoever you are,  Death  does not hesitate to stop and take you when He chooses to.  Whether you are young or old, famous or unknown, when  Death  comes upon your door, there's no escape.  You can not ever hide or run away from  Death .   Death  will not be looking for you because you, yourself, will be looking for  Death .  Everything must come to an end because that's life's rule.   Thinking of all these and how Miko died really made me introspect and think about my own life.  How have I lived my life? Should I change my lifestyle, knowing how one day everything will just end and leave me with nothing?  When that day comes, would I gladly welcome it or would I be scared out of my wits?  How will it happen?  God, I don't know the answer to all these questions and I'm not sure I'd like to know either.  Right now, all I could think of is that I will just try to live my life at the present for I will never know what tomorrow has in store for me.  I may die tomorrow, that's very possible...  The thing is that when my time comes, I'd want to feel that I have done my part in the world and that I'd want to feel I'd be leaving the world without remorse or regret.

        We don't have Christmas in Islam, but we consider Jesus Christ (pbuh) as one of our prophets.  We don't celebrate the most important holiday in the Christian religion and here in the Philippines.  I decided to write about the Christmas season basically because I like the feeling that the season gives me.  No, I don't celebrate it, but Christmas is one of my favorite times of the year (second to Ramadhan and my birthday... Hehehe), especially here in the Philippines.  I like it when it's Christmas because everyone's just so happy and so giving.  My Christian brothers and sisters are just so happy and merry that they almost always forget their problems and issues during this time.  Enemies become friends (again) in Christmas.  And, most especially, families are together and try to forget their differences and reconcile... yes, all because of Chrismas.  Another thing is that the Christmas season always brings out the "good" in every one of my Christian brothers and sisters.  They share their blessings.  Now, some wouldn't normally give and share with others, but during this very special season, they are more than willing to give and share.  No one is ever grouchy.  The line in " Silver Bells " that says  "In the air, there's a feeling of Christmas..."  is very true.  It's like anywhere you go in this country (and probably in every Christian dominated country), you can feel the Christmas air.  I believe that Christmas truly is for giving and sharing.  It is a time when Christian people can, in a way, duplicate the goodness, sharing and giving that Jesus Christ showed during his lifetime.  After all, our Christian brothers and sisters believe that Christ gave his life for humanity.  Now, that is the greatest goodness or gift I could ever imagine.  Imagine giving your life just so your people will be saved?  I wonder if anyone is still capable of doing that in our times.  Christmas, to others, may mean gift-giving, Santa Claus, abundance of food, and all sorts of good things.  To me, Christmas is a time for introspection and genuine giving.  It is a time when people should give without expecting anything in return.  It is a time when people shouldn't only think of themselves, but think of everyone around them as well.  It is a time when people should see beauty in everything in this life, which is the greatest gift from God.  It is the time to start looking within oneself, one's soul, one's life.  And, whatever one gets and understands from Christmas is and should be carried on as one goes on through life.  And then, maybe, just maybe it will feel like Christmas all year long.  I may not be in the position to say all these things because having no Christmas I might not really understand it.  But, these are my thoughts about Christmas.  I may not celebrate it, but I sure am happy that others do... Seeing happy faces and goodness all around me never fails to give me hope- hope that the world still has so much goodness despite everything. And, one day, it might/will feel like Christmas every single day! :)

         The World To One Dying    A s these eyes travel here, there and all around,  N othing of any interest to me do I find, none at all.  A  world full of emptiness and blankness I see.   C almly going to and fro, my heart barely feeling,  A nd my soul blindly searching, I trip and fall,  L ike a leaf slow-ly fall-ing, I fight to see.  M y blessed world, dear God, at last I find and see.  A las, what great waste, I had to die if only to see!

        My bestfriend's wedding... I am on stage reading poetry.  Her favorite piece 'If Love', yes, that is totally perfect for her wedding. I give my best performance.  After all, this is a once in a lifetime event!  Then, I am reading one of her own poems. God, she is a wonderful writer.  What a way with words! I'm crying... crying tears of joy for my bestfriend.  Oh, I couldn't be happier for my bestfriend. She's end up with the person she loves most and who loves her so much in return.  She's sure to be happy with this man, who's a good friend of mine as well.  Their smiles show so much joy, peace and love.  It takes me a few minutes before I could go on with my reading... I couldn't stop staring at them.  Their happiness oozing out and infecting every single person in proximity with them.  They're a really beautiful couple.  My bestfriend, in her beautiful, snowy white gown, and her groom, in his antique white tuxedo...  As they march down the aisle leading to where they would sit down to be watched and observed by acquaintances, friends, and relatives... I catch my bestfriend's eye and give her a happy wink, to which she answered with a little smile.  Ah, that very sincere smile!  This day will be unforgettable, I know it!  A few hours after, we are sitting in my bestfriend's room, which would serve as their conjugal room from now on.  Along with our other  'kadas , we joke around and remember all the things we have been through.  Oh, are these tears I feel coming again? Damn, just when everybody is flowing with genuine happiness and laughter, I have to cry!  One by one, my friends begin to cry, too... And then, my bestfriend is crying, too! Oh, we are all so happy, yet a little bit sad at the same time.  This day marks a change in all our lives.  Nothing will ever be the same.  Now, don't get me wrong here... It's not that I don't want my bestfriend to be married or anything.  It's just that now that she's married, she would have to act like all married women.  There will be more responsibility.  She won't have time to goof around with us anymore.  We will never be able to snuggle as if we, ourselves, were lovers.  There would no longer be talks until the wee hours of the night.  There won't be texting until dawn, even if we were lying on the same bed, so our other  'kadas  wouldn't know or find out about our secrets.  There will never be moments like this... just sitting around laughing unmindful of what is happening or what the boyfriend says.   This day marks the time I will lose, in a way, my bestfriend.  She will be moving on to a world where I am not welcome, a world that I can not understand, at least not yet! It will be as if she would become a totally new person.  She would have to start looking at and approaching life in a different way, a more serious way.  She wouldn't find things that we used to laugh so much about hilarious anymore.  She would start seeing things that were never there before or things that we never really saw or refused to see.  She would, in short, be in another universe.  And, I will remain where I am until God knows when!    Call me selfish, but this is what I'm feeling right now.  I'm afraid that this day wil take my bestfriend away from me.  True, I am really happy for her... but, I can't seem to get rid of this fear, this hateful feeling I have right now.  Honestly, I might be wrong about it.  Maybe nothing will change. Maybe everything will be the same as before (oh, I doubt it!). Yeah, maybe... I still can't stop my blasted mind from thinking about these things!  And, being stuck here doesn't help at all.  I'm here in front of this freakin' monitor typing this (that I may in the future laugh about).  While my bestfriend is back home getting married, I am here wishing and just completely lost in my thoughts... I was supposed to be part of the entourage.  I am here feeling sadder than I have ever been.    Today is my bestfriend's wedding... and, I couldn't be there!!! :(

        	It feels great to be alive… to be just breathing and taking in everything around me or everything that life presents me with.  I have been in this world twenty-three long years and I’d say that I had a pretty good life. True, I may have had encountered sad and bad experiences.  But, all in all, yes, I have had a wonderful life, thank God!  	Life is full of mysteries and as Milan Kundera so aptly put it, life is lived but once and we cannot experiment on choices like the way we could in science projects in order to see the best result.  In life, once we have made our choice, then that’s it, there’s no turning back.  How do we know that “not going for that foreign scholarship” or “selling that ring that belonged to our great-great-great grandmother” would actually result in the achievement of all our dreams or result to having bad luck follow us all our lives?  That is one great mystery of life.  Well, when you actually sit down and think about it, if we knew what lay before us, life would actually lose its marvel.  It wouldn’t be challenging at all.  It would be like some kind of special delicacy that lost its flavor.  	It is actually fun to think about what the world would be like if every person knew what was before him or what his actions and choices would result in.  If that were the case, would anybody in this world ever be a failure?  I mean, wouldn’t it be just weird and stupid for a person to continue with an endeavor if he knew that it would result in the destruction of his life, a whole lifetime of regret and heartaches or even his death?  	Don’t we often find ourselves in crossroads?  We would always find ourselves torn between that road and this road.  Much as we think and reflect about it, the two choices would, most of the time, weigh the same and so we decide to just go on and leave everything to the Fates!  We, Filipinos, are so fond of saying “Bahala na!” at times like this.  It would often seem that there are people who always make the right choices and end up very, very successful that they make us think how lowly our lives are compared to theirs.  At bad times, this kind of people would even bring us to as far as question God about the lives that we have.  And then, there would be some people who seem to never get bad luck out of their way and end up as failures and the biggest losers. Now, seeing this kind of people would make us happy and grateful that our lives haven’t been as bad as theirs.  And again, we would remember God and thank Him.  	I’m not sure if it was Ernest Hemingway who said in one of his books that people always come to God as last resort when nothing could be done or when nobody in the world could help them.  And, oh, isn’t that so true with most of us?  I wonder how God, perfect as He is, takes this.  Not that God is comparable to people, but if you were in such a place or position where most people only come to you when they need you and forget about you as soon as they get what they want, how would that make you feel?  I, for one, would really feel insulted and take that as some kind of a slap on the face.  I sure am thankful that God isn’t like any human being at all.  That idea gives me the assurance that God is never cruel and judgmental. Because if God were, I don’t know what would become of the world and the whole humanity!    	God and life are both full of mysteries- mysteries that I would rather leave as is.  I love and enjoy life as it is.  I love and thank God that He is as He is.  And, forever I will…:)

        “ One broken dream is not the end of dreaming. ”  	This very meaningful sentence I, so long ago learned from my mother, has always been my motto, and I say, brought me far and wide.  It never failed to bring out my best qualities and strengthened my determination so as to make me strive for the achievement of whatever it is that I dream of.  Despite any obstacle, I would always hold fast to my dream – my  Personal Legend .  	A book, so beautifully written, has fueled back to life that fire in my heart; a book that talks about the nature of life, nature of the world, and, of course, of man and his dream or quest in life.  The book, that turned my life around and is absolutely my most favorite book of all time, was written by a Brazilian writer,  Paulo Coelho .  It is very aptly entitled   “The Alchemist”   for it truly brings out the alchemist in every reader.  	At a time of utter confusion about what to do with my life, I stumbled upon the book.  A very good friend of mine was telling me how good it was, and having nothing to do at the time or maybe I was just too bored and down-trodden to be doing anything, I said to myself, “Hey, why not read this book and see for yourself if it is any good?”  I never expected the impact that little book, that I almost missed, had in me.  I didn't know I was holding in my hands a very precious treasure that would help me find myself again.  The book showed me what my life was all about and basically taught me how to go about my life.  	With every turn of a page, I saw myself as the character, Santiago.  Every page made me introspect and think.  I just could not help but agree and, thus, I saw things- everything, big or small, important or not- clearly.  I was automatically enveloped in the book’s wisdom.  It took me with Santiago to a wonderful journey, not only to great places, but within my very own heart, my very own soul.  	Surprisingly, the book’s simplicity shows the complex blending of many a philosophy.  This great intermingling of different ideas achieves its purpose in that every reader would surely see the very things that s/he believes in and holds sacred in his/her heart.  Be the reader a Muslim, a Christian, a Taoist, a Buddhist, a Shinto, an Oriental, a Westerner, rich, poor, old, young, man, woman, name it, s/he will surely be able to relate with the young Santiago or the great alchemist.  	The author’s concepts of the  Soul of the World  and the  Language of the World  show the oneness of all beings.  These things are what hold us all together and are very important in all our lives.  These are what keep us all alive.  	There is, of course, the  One Hand  that designs and writes everything.  This shows the Glory of THE GOD – our one God.  The depiction of His Greatness brought me to tears.  At a time as ours, it is truly heart-warming to actually read something so firm and strong in its faith and belief in God.                    The book gave me the feeling of security that whoever I am, whatever I am, I am part of the macrocosm of the universe.  I am the same as other people.  I am as great as others.  	What I like most about the book is its focus on the idea of achieving one’s  Personal Legend .  This Personal Legend is every creature’s or being’s ultimate goal in life or purpose of existence – one’s dream.  It is man’s desire to be better than what he is; it is man’s desire to be the best.  	As a Muslim, I see this as my  Personal Jihad   (Primary Jihad in Islam, actually, is the person’s war against the evil within, that is the person’s struggle to be good, better and the best of what s/he is).  Before I encountered the book, I was in doubt whether I could actually face what was before me.  As any other young person, I was feeling nervous and anxious about all the challenges that await me.  I knew and felt I wanted to make it big.  But how, I had no idea.  I was afraid to end up a failure.  But, “ The Alchemist ” showed me that I would never fail so long as I believe and so long as I try.  I just have to listen and talk to my heart.  I just have to accept that being one with the universe, as part of the Soul of the World, I have only to do my part and all will be done and will be well in the end.  	With all these new tools that “The Alchemist” has given me, I know I am ready and am bound for success.  Life is about dreams- believing and doing one’s best to achieve these dreams.  These dreams have been ordained to each one of us by God’s very own Hands.  “ When a person really desires something, the universe conspires to help the person realize his dreams .” (Quoted from the book.)  	The book made me understand the true meaning of life.  It has given me the confidence, courage and the idealism that I thought I completely lost.  “ The Alchemist ” has given me THE reason to go on.  And, as I know that God is always with me, as long as “The Alchemist” remains in my heart, I will go on and I shall make it big.   Insha-Allah   (God willing).

        I am here... just staring at the monitor, my brain so full of ideas and many other things.   I begin to feel something indescribable.  My brain... oh, my brain has just burst into a million bits! And, now, one by one, these bits from my poor brain struggle, crawl and move towards one another trying to find their place, where they could be accepted.  Then, finally, they turn into one single body.    And, suddenly, I'm back just staring at the monitor not exactly knowing what to say or what to write.  I really have a problem with starting to write.  It has always been my issue.  I have millions and millions of ideas and thoughts, but as soon as I sit down and start to write... poof!  Everything is gone before I even realize what's happening.  And then, I go back at wondering, thinking.  Why? I always ask myself. Why do words escape me when I need them most?  Is it because I am poor at expressing myself?  Is it because I am scared, damn too scared of my thoughts?  Maybe it's a combination of the two or even more.  God, I wish I knew...  There are times I try to write, but before I could finish what I'm writing I end up crying and never really get around to finish things.  Sure, I've written some things that are, well, quite good, but nothing really as brilliant or substantial as I want it to be.  Though, I've tried and tried and tried.  Maybe I just expect too much of myself.  Maybe I'm just too emotional to be writing. Maybe I was just never cut for writing.  Or am I just suffering from a severe case of writer's block this morning? ;)

         Auuzubillahi minash-shayttanir rajiim. Bismillahir rahmaanir rahiim.   Assalaamu aliakum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.    *****************************    I am really excited about this blogging thing. I actually got the idea and was inspired by my new "object of admiration", Miss Ala Paredes. Hey, don't get me wrong here. I'm no lesbo or anything, but this girl is totally something. Her writing makes me laugh and wonder about life- my life. You see, much as she wants to project or show that life- her life isn't that good or that her life is like this or like that, the "screw you all, I have an angst-filled life" sort of thing, I can't help but feel that she actually has a close to perfect life. I mean, just look at how her family, studies and career seem to fall just in the right place at all times. Yes, it's really true that one does not really know what is happiness unless s/he feels what it is to be sad, to be hurt.   I admire this girl because she writes from the heart. I mean, she writes whatever she thinks, whatever she wants. She is not afraid to show or announce to whoever is reading what she really feels and thinks. Others may not like what she says or what she writes, who cares! It's her life. It's the freedom, the free flow of her ideas that I like, the straight-forwardness. She just writes and writes and you feel like you know her, like you're a part of her world... You feel like she's in front of you whining, shrieking with glee, crying, throwing a tantrum. And, most important of all, she does all these without so much effort. She was born with a natural talent for writing. She transforms paper (or should I say monitor?) into a picture of a sea of different creatures. She paints pictures with words without trying too hard. So what if the picture is blurry? So what if the picture is too dark or too light? Who cares?! It's her picture anyway, and if you don't want to give the picture even a glance, so be it! Who the f*ck cares?!   This is how I picture Ala's mind, how she writes. With more practice and training (for practice makes perfect), she will, one day, be a great painter of words. Oh, and she paints real pictures, too. See, what a talented young girl she is? A great writer in the making. That's Ala. I hope that she never tires of writing and that the day will come that she writes for a much larger audience.   Okay, I guess that is enough about Ala. Well, it's but natural that I write about her in my first entry because, as I have said, she was my inspiration in making a blog of my own. That would mean that she is, in a way, my muse. Hehehe:) Is that lesbo or lesbo? No! And, I mean it!:) Oh, and let's add the fact that before I read her blog, I wouldn't have known what a freakin' blog was! Now, don't I owe her a lot? (I'm thinking all of a sudden, why the f*ck am I so defensive about this?! And, who am I trying to convince? Myself?! Yikes!)   I'm really happy about this blogging thing mainly because now I have found something where I can just pour eveything out on. I could just write what I want to write and what I may normally be afraid of writing without caring and without the fear of being judged. That's one of my fears and that causes me lots of heartaches (figurative and literal). Well, that is because it really hurts when you think of something and you want to write about or on it, but you can't because you are afraid that someone may see it and may just think what a freakin' distorted humanoid you are! I love witing journals, but sometimes it freaks me out to think that someone might actually read it and might just have a piece of who I really am. What if s/he doesn't like what s/he sees? I am just such a chicken when it comes to rejection. This is why I never, ever submit my "thoughts in paper", for fear I might be judged and not be accepted. But, reading Ala (here we go again) changed that for me! Who cares if I think this?! It's me who's thinking anyway. And, who am I thinking for anyway? I know that our culture and society make us think the way we do. But, in my case, I think it's gone overboard! Why? Because, man, even my innermost thoughts, I am afraid to disclose or I am afraid to even entertain because of all the confounded ideas I have accumulated through age!   I want to be the person of my own! I want to be the captain not only of my soul, but of my thoughts, of my life, of every single thing that's mine! I want to be the person that I want to be, the person that I should be. I want to be free! And, with this blog, I begin my quest to freedom!:)

        I love reading.  I've read the most unbelievable, the most hilarious, the stupidest, the weirdest stuff.  I've read the most serious, the most mind-boggling, the most disturbing kinds of texts (written pieces).  I've read different articles, books (fiction and non-fiction), stories, poems, blogs, etc.  My reading has brought me far and wide.  It has enabled me to go around the world, and even outside the world.  I love reading; it's my favorite thing to do.  But, in all my years of reading, nothing prepared me for what I have just read a while ago.  It was a news item (from London).  I saw it in one of the forums in RBJ, and it totally shocked me!  The title,  Boy, 15, Raped His Mother , made me feel sick!  As I read through the news item, I was just thinking, "God, what is the world coming to?".  I just couldn't believe something this sick could happen.  I know of the Oedipus syndrome, having read and done a paper on Oedipus in college, but I never really thought that a guy would actually go as far as rape his mother!  Until this very moment, I'm still shaking inside!  Maybe that boy wasn't in his right mind, God, he can't be!  Maybe he was on drugs.  I refuse to accept or entertain the possibility of him thinking straight when he did that.  I've often heard and read of fathers raping their own daughters, grandfathers raping their own grandchildren, and friends raping their girl-friends.  I've heard and read of infants, mentally disabled, and old women sexually abused.  Men  who do this are animals, I always say.  They don't deserve to be forgiven!  They deserve to be given to the dogs or the crocodiles for that's where they truly belong.  They make me want to kick the hell out of every single male human being alive!  But, hearing of a mother being raped by her own son?!  That is just sick!  And, knowing how forgiving and understanding mothers are, that poor woman would have forgiven her son before we know it.  I swear, if I was in any way related to that boy, I would have taken justice into my own hands and cut his you-know-what to a million pieces or just kill him, slowly but surely!  I'd be too angry to feel pity or to hear my conscience!    Right now, I'm too shaken and angry to continue writing about this!  It's just driving me nuts!  Especially after I saw one RBJ member comment that something like this (mother raped by own son) actually happened in Singapore.  The boy, he said, was seventeen and was forgiven by the mother!  Oh, mother!!! :(

        1.   Flashback   The stillness of the night, The eerie silence of dawn Bring thoughts of all things Past, done and left undone!  As my heart’s ears listen to  The music of silent serenity, And my mind’s eyes see  Things invisible and unseen…  My soul longs to go- Beyond the chilly blanket Of the dark night and To things past and gone by!    2.            I am the Phoenix    F rom down the very stretches of mine soul,  E ndless thoughts of times great and gone by  L ift themselves to where me stands dreaming.  I mpatient tears escape to spring upon mine cheeks,  C ares of vengeful vanity triumph over me,  I rrepressible, I grope to go and show to all  T he girl who’ll rise from memory’s bones and ashes,  Y esterday, she was down, and yes, that was yesterday!

        The past week, I started my new part-time job as an on-line English tutor.  What we do is we teach English to Japanese (based in Japan) via the Internet.  This can be quite tough since the students fall on different levels.  Some can already converse in English pretty well; some could barely understand English.  This means that we have a lot of adjusting to do.  Having had experience in teaching English, this is not really new to me.  I know how difficult it is to teach a second language, especially to reluctant learners.  The teacher always has to be up on his/her toe trying to get everyone to participate and learn some basic things at the very least.  Basically, I already expected how tough the job might be.    But, what really shocked me is the fact that in my new teaching “stint”, I would have to try to change my accent.  My accent has never really been a problem, but the Japanese, it seems, want to be taught English by someone who has American accent.  I find that quite weird because having a particular accent doesn’t necessarily mean that your language or your knowledge of a certain language is perfect, does it?  If American accent was THE correct accent in speaking English, then what of the British?  And, what American accent are we talking about anyway?  Southern, Northern, Eastern, Western, Black American?  Who is to say that this accent is more standard than that other one?  Being an English Language major, I know how controversial “standard English” could get!  As I was talking to one of the executive officers of the company I work for last Friday, he mentioned that an American accent was the only thing I lack.  He said that if I had American accent, I would be a perfect English teacher.  That’s, of course, according to their standards- the Japanese standards for a perfect English teacher.  I was flattered yet taken aback.  I was flattered because he appreciated and commended the way I did my lessons.  And, I was quite taken aback by his comment about my having to learn American accent.  I really don’t feel like I need to have a different accent just to be a competent teacher.  I’m not saying that my English is impeccable as it is, but having to speak in a totally different manner as I normally would?  That would be a little weird for me.  Besides, it’s not like I can master American accent in a few weeks time.    They say they’re going to send me to an American accent training school.  That would be a great opportunity for me to learn new things, but I’m not really sure if I’m very excited about it.  Until then, I’ll just wait and see.

        I was on my way to work (Yes, I have a new part-time job!) and while the jeepney I was riding was caught in traffic, a little beggar boy went inside and started wiping our feet/shoes with his dirty piece of rag.  Afterwards, he waited for people to spare him some coins or probably some left-over food or something.  This isn’t really new to me.  Having been used to taking the cheapest public transportation in the Philippines, the jeepney, I have also become used to seeing sights of this kind.  The beggars around Metro Manila would always make me feel either disillusionment in the Philippines, remorse within myself, and/or gratitude to God for not making me a street beggar.  But, yesterday afternoon, what caught my attention was the little boy’s disposition.  Only one or two of the passengers gave him some coins and another gave him some cookies.  He was very happy at what he got that he couldn’t wipe the huge grin off his face.  He almost looked funny.  He showed his treasure of a cookie to his friends and clutched it close to his heart.  Since our jeepney wasn’t about to move yet, he sat down for a while, still smiling.  One of the passengers (the one seated next to him) told him to get down, but the boy was too happy to listen or even hear him.  As the light was about to turn green, he got down and I saw him playing tag with some of his friends in the middle of the street, amid the rushing automobiles.  And, the smile stayed… and even grew wider and wider.  I couldn’t get that smile out of my head because it was the kind of smile that showed genuine happiness and contentment.  The little boy in dirty, torn clothes was truly happy and contented with the cookies and the two one-peso coins he got.  That kind of happiness and contentment hit something within me.  Seeing the boy so happy and contented made me feel very happy for him and rather ashamed of myself.  Ashamed of myself? Yes… myself and other people like me!  My parents, aunts, uncles, older brothers and sisters have always given me everything that I wanted or liked so long as they can afford to give.  All my life, I have been sheltered, pampered and very well taken care of that not until I came to Manila did I realize that what I saw on TV or in the movies about poverty are actually true.  All my life, I have always thought of how people around the world suffered and how I wanted to help each and every one of them if possible.  Now, I just laugh that off.  I used to cry for people who were hard up.  I still do, at times, but ever since I came face to face with poverty and hopelessness, I just sort of lost it.  That probably meant I grew up, I matured.  I couldn’t cry for other people any more than I could cry for myself.  I found out that the easy life I was so used to wasn’t really that easy.  I learned of the value of money and reluctantly admitted that money, in one way or another, made the world go round!  Now, I go to school as an “Iskolar ng Bayan” and I am supported by my folks.  I don’t have anything to complain about.  I don’t have too much money, but I never really run out of it.  I have enough money to spend going out and having fun with friends.  And, recently (just this week), I’ve gotten a new part-time job and that would add some more pesos in my pocket.  I’m waiting for a call from yet another company offering another part-time job.  And, lastly, I’m planning to apply for a permanent job next semester.  As they say, “strike while the iron is hot!”  Then, I saw that smile…  With everything that I have, have I ever smiled that kind of smile?  I have more than enough, but still I can’t stop looking for more.  Have I ever really felt contented and happy with everything that I have that I can just sigh and just smile the way that little boy smiled?  Well, yes, probably…  I can’t really tell.  And, I ask myself, “what do I really want from life?”  It’s obvious; I want to conquer the world!  I want to have anything and everything that I ever wanted and wished for!  But, then again, after I get all these, everything that I want, would I smile like that little boy did?  And then, I wonder, again, is it really money that makes the world go round?  Right now, I’m smiling at the thought…

        Aah, 2004!!!  My first entry for the year...  I sure hope to have more entries, better and more substantial ones at that, this year.  I have always kept a journal, but I don't really write as much as I would want to or as often as people I know do.  But, I sure do love writing.  It's like an escape for me.  It's the time when I could just be myself and just pour everything out.  And, now that I have found out this blogging thing, I really hope to write more.    Today, I'd like to write about the past year.  A friend of mine told me 2003 was to be my year because I was born on the 23rd of March and I was to turn 23 on the said year.  Now I'm thinking whether it truly was my year or not.  Hmmm, what have I done and accomplished during the year?  Was it a good year for me?  First, I'm going to go back in time...  In the early part of the year, I was home.  Finally, after two years of being away, I finally went home.  For two great and happy months, I was with my family, old friends and some of my bestfriends.  I taught in the pre-university program of our university.  As always, the students were a handful and, at times, gave me migraine attacks so bad I thought I had cancer of the brain!  But, all in all, my stint in that program was really fun and interesting, very challenging and really fulfilling.  Those were really good times.  Then, I went back here again to continue in my quest for education, knowledge and, let's face it, a better life.  School was pretty much the same.  The courses I took were very interesting as they always are.  I had two unforgettable professors.  The first one is unforgettable for her being a really good and effective teacher.  Young as she is, I consider her one of the best teachers because she could make complex things simple and she respects her students.  The other one is unforgettable because of the fact that he is absolutely the opposite of the first one!  Although he was nice and all, he was not at all effective and competent as a teacher.  It was his first time to handle the course, so he was also in the process of learning it.  The problem was that he was too busy to be good.  He could have been good because he's really intelligent and all, but he was just not into the whole thing.    Well, basically, three quarters of my 2003 were spent in school.  Nothing really bad or tragic happened that concerned me or anybody I love.  But, was it my year?  I could say there have been better years for me, yes, but 2003 was definitely a good year.  And, personally, I wouldn't want to pick a significant year as MY year because every year in my life is MY year.  A lot of things happen every single year.  There will always be good times and, well, some bad times, too.  That's how life is.  But, in the end, it all really depends on every person.  I choose to live each year to the fullest.  After all these things said, I know and I feel that 2004 will be MY year in as much as 2003 was my year.  Good things will continue to happen, so will some bad things...  But, this year will be special because I choose to make it great and special!:)

        Classical and instrumental music have been my favorite kinds of music ever since I learned to appreciate music other than the songs we learned in class back in Grade School.  Beautiful music always gives me the feeling of euphoria or what most would call “high”.  This is the reason why I usually don’t like other people (especially people who don’t me much) to see me when I “really” listen to music.  I go nuts while listening to MY kind of music.  Good thing most people my age don’t really like the kind of music I love listening to.:)  Music is one of the things that are sure to make me cry.  I used to get teased a lot because of this (well, I still do).  Music makes me want to close my eyes, spread my hands and just be free from everything.  My senses become alive when I hear beautiful music.  When I watch movies,  music is one of the most important things I consider.  Maybe I was a musician in my past life, I don’t know.  All I know is that music resides in my heart and soul.  I cannot live without music.    Last night, I was listening to the  Il Postino  (The Postman) official soundtrack when, as usual, I started to cry.  I was listening to  Pablo Neruda 's love poems being read by famous Hollywood stars.  Poetry is another thing that always makes me cry and is also a very important part of my life (that deserves a whole new blog entry).  After the Neruda poems came the part of instrumental music.  I was trying my best not to cry, but when it came to this part, I just couldn’t stop it anymore.  I cried not only because the music was simply beautiful, but also because I remembered my  Kuya Reynill .  Kuya Reynill was my classmate back in Grade School and High School.  He was really nice, very kind.  He was never the sensitive type.  This was probably why he would always be the butt of class jokes.  No, he didn’t look funny at all.  He was neither clowning around all the time.  He was, in fact, rather serious.  It was just that he had more share of mistakes and, well, embarrassing moments than most of us.  But, not in any time did he ever get affected by this fact.  He would always laugh with us when we laughed at him.  That was how nice he was.  He was a happy person.  I was quite close to him, which is why I was one of the first few to call him “Kuya” (older brother).  He was really like a brother to me.  I loved him dearly (I never knew if he ever knew how much we all loved him).  How could you not love someone who was as kind as to gladly volunteer to get you stuff from far-away stores just because you don’t feel like getting up from your comfortable chair?  How could you not love someone who would always be there to listen to your childish thoughts and foolish ideas?  How could we not love him?  On our third year in High School, Kuya Reynill, knowing how much I loved classical and instrumental music, introduced me to the  Dying Young  original soundtrack.  I remember him telling me how he cried when he listened to that tape.  He even teased me about my crying over beautiful music.  And, so,  I listened to the soundtrack.  As expected, I cried buckets of tears (and I haven’t even seen the movie at that time).  I was just enveloped by the feeling of sadness that the music wanted to create in the listener.  I knew I had to have that tape for my collection.   I told (note that I didn’t ask) Kuya Reynill that I wanted the tape.  He told me it was his cousin’s.  I told him that I wanted it and I didn’t care if it belonged to his cousin or whoever.  He had to beg me to give it back.  I didn’t give it back until he promised to buy me one.  He also said that for him to buy me my own copy of the tape would be really great because I was sure not to ever forget him.  “Every time na marinig mo ‘yun,  maaalala mo ako, ‘di ba ?”  (Every time you hear that piece, you’ll remember me, won’t you?)  I didn’t even appreciate this, I only told him to hurry up and buy me the tape as soon as possible.  He could only say, “ Sige, pagpunta ko ulit sa Iligan, ha ?” (Okay, next time I go to Iligan, alright?)  That made my day.  But, he never fulfilled his promise.  He went to Iligan often, but he would always forget to get me my Dying Young soundtrack.  The days became weeks and months, but the tape never came until I totally forgot about the promise.  I guess he forgot about it as well.  The months became years and before we knew it, we were already graduating from High School.    He went to school in Iligan; I stayed in MSU and never heard much from or about him.  I could count on the fingers of my right hand the number of times I saw him all throughout college.  In no time, I graduated from college.  In the one year that I bummed around, I never saw him at all.  Then, I decided to come to Manila for further studies.  Dying Young and Kuya Reynill became just mere shadows behind larger and fonder memories.  I barely remembered him.    As I sallied through Asian studies and, later, English studies, life became very busy and all about Asian history and culture, Japan and the English language.  High School seemed to have been centuries ago.  The childish fears and ideas had more or less been completely forgotten.  The times I passed and left kept to themselves most memories of the good ol’ days.  It was impossible to remember Kuya Reynill, especially after years of not seeing or hearing from him.  Then, one day, big news of my dear Kuya Reynill came.  It was so unexpected I almost went crazy when I heard it.  It was so unbelievable I wanted to fly back home just to know if it were true.  He was a natural jester, yes, but Kuya Reynill could not have borne to play such a joke- a cruel, cruel joke on me!  I desperately tried to contact everyone I knew to confirm that the news was a just a big joke.  It wasn’t…  Kuya Reynill never got me that soundtrack.  But, he made sure that it would forever remind me of him.  What a great joke he played on me!  He never fulfilled that promise for he had another thing in mind.  I never knew that he wanted that beautiful piece to carry his very memory.  “Every time you hear that piece, you’ll remember me, won’t you?”  I never thought that when he said these words, he was telling me something. I never knew that he would, himself,  be “DYING YOUNG”.    I will be getting a copy of that soundtrack one day.  And, I know that wherever and whenever I listen to it, my Kuya Reynill will be with me.:)

        My special thanks go to  Balbonics  and  Adam  for the questions they posted.  I chose to answer the questions of both " posters " (is this actually the right term?) because, well, they're the only ones I got.  Hehehe:)  Not that I expect many people read my blog, but the idea of getting questions got me quite excited.  Anyway, here are my answers.  Adam's questions:   1. Why the name BabyPink?  -- I chose BabyPink because I love  PINK  (My favorite shade is  baby pink . You know, like sweet, light pink.) and  BABY  is one of my favorite words in the world.  Oh, and, well, I love babies. :)  2. If you could be a cartoon character, who would you be? -- Disney's Mulan... :)    3. If you won a million US$, what would you do with it?  -- I'll give half to my parents, a quarter to charity, and the rest I'll use to buy things that I've always wanted and gifts for my family and friends.:)   4. Would you rather have a man who loves you but whom you don't love or a man whom you love but doesn't love you?  -- I'd rather have a man who loves me because I'll eventually learn to love him.  And then, we'll live happily ever after. :)   5. Would you marry a man who is nice, handsome, rich and loves you but is impotent+infertile?  --  Sure, I'll marry him.  We can adopt children if we want children (and I have so many nieces and nephews, having no children wouldn't be a problem).  As for being impotent, well, I know it's important that people should be able to "perform", but that is not the most important thing for me.  Love is the answer! :)  Bablbonics' questions:    1. What would you rather live in: A house with no roof or a house with no bathroom?  -- A house with no bathroom.  I could do "my thing" in my neighbor's or in the " gilid-gilid " and/or " bukid ". :P   2. What would you rather eat: Chocolate that tastes like shit or shit that tastes like chocolate?  -- I'd choose  chocolate that tastes like shit  anytime.  No matter how good shit tastes, the thought that it's shit is just eeeewww!  But, come to think of it, we eat lots of good food, right?  Wouldn't it be possible that shit tastes like the food we eat?  Then, maybe sometimes shit really tastes like chocolate.  Has anybody ever checked?  Aaaacckk, what am I saying?!!   3. You're relocating to another country for good and have only one backpack to bring with you. What are its contents?  -- Hmm, tough one (especially knowing what a disorganized and totally sentimental person I am).  For sure, there'd be  at least one  good book in it (probably Coelho's "The Alchemist").  I will be sure to bring my prayer things (carpet, prayer "costume", pasbi, etc.), the Holy Qur'an, a photo album containing pictures of me, my family and my friends, my favorite blanket (which I actually call BabyPink), my ID, toiletries.  And, LOOOTS of money so I could buy everything that I forgot to put in my backpack! How big is this backpack, anyway? :)   4. If someone gave you a pet right now, what would you name it?  -- Arigatou ( Thank you  in Japanese).  The nickname will be Ari (final syllable is pronounced with a continuous flowing out of air and not with a glottal stop, ha.).       5. It's your last day on earth and you're having a full-course meal of your choice. What's in it? (maximum of 2 desserts please!)  -- Everything Meranao, except that none of the food will be hot/spicy, so that would mean that I'll need to talk to the Meranao cook first.  There will be  kiyoning  (Meranao yellow rice),  manok a papaparan  (chicken with coconut), bolied egg,  badak  (young jackfruit cooked the Meranao way).  Dessert will be my favorite  tiyateg  (a kind of Meranao sweet that looks like hard, fried brown hair) and  biyaki  (Meranao sweet that's made of ground corn, sugar and rice).  I will be eating all this with my hands, no silverware.  Everything will be served on a  tabak  (Meranao brass table).  And, there should be COKE, lots of it! :)    Wow, I had fun answering those questions!  Q and A of this type always gives us an idea about who we (both "person who asks" and "person asked"). are, what kind of people we are, and how our minds work.  They're really fun!  I love this chain/game.  Doumo arigatou gozaimashita, Balbonics and Adam! :)

        There's this  blog chain  that has caught my attention.  It goes like this, you ask me  five questions .  These questions can be of any kind, but, it would be more fun if they were really  weird  and  out of this world .  You can ask anything, from the color of my favorite blanket to what's under my bed.  Just shoot!  After I pick the best ones, I shall post the answers on this blog and I also get to ask the person/s (the "poster" of the chosen questions) five questions, which s/he will also answer on his/her blog.  S/he will, of course, have to ask his/her readers to do the same so the chain would continue. :)  Thanks!  (You can post your questions on my Comment ( Your Thoughts ) Board.)

        I have seen almost all our local stars here in the Philippines.  Sometimes I love to look at them, sometimes I couldn’t care less.   I have always thought of our stars as ordinary people with extraordinary jobs.  While I am a movie fan and I love to hear stories and controversies about our stars, I’ve never really been the “shriekin’ fan”  (except, of course, if we’re talking about Hideaki Takizawa, Denzel Washington, Ken Zhu (of F4), Orlando Bloom, Bernard Palanca, Prince William of Wales, and my ultimate crush and “idol” Maksim Mrvica).  Okay, I AM a “shriekin’ fan”!  While I’m at my “fan-y” self, I’d like to write more about it.  So, today, I will list down the names of the celebrities who, so far, have had my eye almost go out of their sockets and my mouth drop to the floor (or simply had me starstruck).  These are, of course, some of the (few) celebrities I totally love!  Well, duh…   Oscar Orbos  --  I have always, always loved Oscar Orbos.  I remember reading about his being the  Political Wonder Boy  during Aquino’s time.  I was so young then that what stuck in my mind was the idea that he was the  Wonder Boy  of the Philippines, you know, like  Wonder Woman .  I never forgot that name.  Then, one night, I chanced upon GMA 7’s  Debate .  To my delight, the  Wonder Boy  was there.  Not only was he a guest, he was the host.  After that, I religiously followed  Debate  every Thursday night.  I would always look forward to Pareng Oca’s last statement about the issues.  I would always love and agree with his ideas.  I felt like he was verbalizing my exact take on issues.  His way with words always amazed me (still does).  One day, I was walking, with an aunt, along J. Bocobo St. in Ermita when my aunt suddenly said, “Ah, Orbos is here.  That is his car.”  I couldn’t believe my ears!  Oh my God, finally I was to see MY  Wonder Boy !  I half-dragged my aunt inside Hizon’s (where Orbos was drinking coffee) and begged her that we order something and sit there for a while.  I immediately went to the table next to his and sat where I was sure to have my back to him (stupid decision!).  I couldn’t see him so I kept asking my aunt what the guy was doing.  After a while, we decided it was time to go.  When I stood up, I stole a glance at his direction just in time as he looked up from his newspaper.  I caught his eye.  He smiled and gave me a little nod.  I smiled back, shyly.  Needless to say, I wanted to faint right then and there!:)     Jim Paredes  --  I have loved the APO Hiking Society since God knows when!  They’re like the ultimate OPM artists for me.  I love every single one of their songs.  I have watched them every Sunday on ABS-CBN 2’s  Sa Linggo nAPO Sila .  I have watched them every single day when  Sa Linggo…  became  ‘Sang Linggo nAPO Sila .  The trio never failed to complete my days.  They still do when I see or hear them (which happens once in a blue moon nowadays).  There was this one time, I and my dorm-mates had the craving for Starbucks coffee so we decided to go to Katipunan.  It was the night the Ateneo Blue Eagles won the UAAP Championship over the La Salle Green Archers (I forgot the year, 2002 or 2003).  The whole Ateneo was celebrating then.  Starbucks was just crowded full.  Everywhere we looked, people were wearing Ateneo shirts.  As we were seated, a guy walked past our table.  One of my dorm-mates whispered, “Si Jim Paredes…”  When I heard that, I couldn’t dare look at the direction my dorm-mate was pointing to.  God, Jim Paredes was walking around the coffee shop and I couldn’t even look at him!  Great!  Then, I couldn’t take it anymore, I summoned all my courage and looked at their table.  He was with his family (I didn’t know Ala then).  For thirty seconds, I couldn’t stop looking at him.  I don’t know if I imagined it or what, but I remember our eyes met.  For about three seconds, we stared at each other.  He didn’t smile, I didn’t smile.  And, inside I was kicking myself for not mouthing “I love APO!” or even a little “Hi”.  Then, I couldn’t look at him anymore lest I might go over their table and do or say something really stupid.:)      Robert Sena  --  I loved Robert Sena as  Thuy  in  Miss Saigon .  “You’re here. It’s true… it is as I was told.  This man, and you! For how much were you sold?!”  God, he was just great!  That was one of my favorite scenes in the play.  Robert Sena gave me the creeps.  It was like he was so angry he could actually start shooting at all of us!  His acting and voice were just marvelous!  No wonder he’s said to be the best  Thuy  ever!   On Sunday afternoons, I usually go roller-blading in the UP Oval (around the Sunken Garden).  One of these afternoons, I was already getting up a sweat when I saw this huge dog.  I love pets so much.  So, I decided to stop skating and just watch the dog for a while.  He was really adorable.  After a few minutes, I decided I had enough watching the giant run here and there.  So, I started to go and that was the only time the owner caught my attention.  I thought he looked very familiar, but I couldn’t place where I saw him.  Was he an old neighbor, a friend of a friend?  I have already gained speed when it dawned on me who it was.  I turned so abruptly I almost fell on my elbows.  I went over the side of a tree so he wouldn’t really see me totally gawking at him.  After sometime, I went on to go back to the dorm.  All I could think of was how stupid I was, watching that dog for more than five minutes and not noticing that the owner was actually  Thuy  himself, Robert Sena!  Tsk, tsk, tsk…   Jestoni Alarcon  --  Now, this guy I don’t really like.  I mean, he’s just the usual actor to me.  I’ve seen him in one or two movies, but he never really left an impact on me.  He’s just plain Jestoni…  One time, a friend and I were walking around SM Megamall when I remembered I needed to buy one of those rubber things you wrap around the handle of a badminton racket.  We went to the part of the mall where there were some sports stores.  When we got there, we saw that there were a crowd of people watching an event there.  We didn’t know there was an All-Star Badminton Tourney.  We decided to take a peek at what all these people were watching. There were just sooo many stars and celebrities there.  We instantly decided to get out of there for fear of being crushed to death or being suffocated.  I didn’t even get to buy what I needed.  Just as we were leaving, I saw the best-looking guy I have ever seen (in person, that is) in my whole life!  Sweat covered his whole body, but he was handsome as handsome could be. It was Jestoni Alarcon. I was left agape for one or two minutes.  I wanted to throw myself at him so badly that I knew I had to drag myself out of there.:)     Ala Paredes  --  I adooore this girl!  Need I say more?!:)   Hmm, come to think of it… I’ve had my share of starstruck moments I, now, realize.  Funny, I never really knew or realized how “fan-y” I could actually be around these stars.  And, really, it’s fun to be a fan!:)  There are times in life when we feel and do things that we don’t expect ourselves capable of feeling and doing.  We sometimes do things that we have never even dreamt of doing.  But, at the end of it all, these are the things that make life such a colorful ocean!:)

            As I've written in my first blog entry, Ala Paredes is my current "object of admiration" and, in a way, my "muse".  She is really something.  And, why am I writing all this?  Well, because I FINALLY MET HER in person last night! Man, was I ecstatic! I was excited and happy beyond words! After meeting her, I was like floating on air.  So, that's how a fan feels when s/he sees his/her favorite star or celebrity.:-O   The story of THE night:   I and two of my friends went to the RCBC Plaza to watch Footloose (an Ateneo Blue Rep play).  The play was great.  Every single one of them (actors) did a swell job!  Nobody was willing to be outstaged by another, not even the dancers.  The dances were awesome! The music (songs) was great.  I cried three times and laughed a gazillion times!  It was a really good one.  After the 10 minute (half-time?) break, Ala went onstage.  It took so much effort to stop myself from shouting.  I was so happy I wanted to cry.  My friends and I couldn't believe how pretty she was.  I mean, she looks good and all on TV and in pictures, but in person, man, she's waaay better looking.  Her tall, slim figure, of course, stood out.  Even if she wasn't dancing like crazy (like the others), and she just stood there (in her model-like stance), it was impossible not to notice her.  Her number was really short, though.  Anyway, after the show, we went to get our share of the free ice cream bars they gave out.  As we ate our lemonade-flavored ice cream bars, we waited just outside the theater to get a glimpse of the actors we liked most, and of course, to see Ala up close since not one of us could shut up about how beautiful she looks in person! (Yeah, she really is that pretty!)  My guy friend couldn't believe he didn't notice her before (in Myx).    So, after a few minutes of waiting nervously (in my case), she finally came out.  She didn't have any make-up on save for lipstick/lip gloss.  And, my friend says she noticed how nice-looking Ala's feet were.  Hehehe:)  Her height made us look like hobbits and her beauty made us look like common ladies-in-waiting and she, the princess! When she passed by us, I called out, "Hi Ala."  And with the brightest smile I ever saw, she said, "Hi there," or something like that.  I introduced myself and she told me I looked exactly like my friendster photo. Hehehe:)  And, then, she had to go take pictures with her friends.     After a few minutes, I couldn't resist the urge to ask her for a picture-taking.  Gosh, it's not everyday I get to meet this wonderful, wonderful girl (Add the fact that her dad is one of my biggest Filipino idols since God knows when!).  I was really feeling my cheeks turn red due to nervousness and sheer embarrassment at my actions. Oh, but to hell with that, I love the girl and I HAD to have a picture taken with her!  She agreed and the next thing I knew I was up in cloud-nine. (I couldn't even remember what we said to each other, that is if I was able to even speak at all!)  I was just happy beyond belief! Really, really...    My friends were really happy for me, too, even if I forgot to introduce them to her.  They knew how much I like Ala and all.  They didn't tease me or anything.  Maybe, partly because Ala was really friendly and acted as if we were really friends (and I'd like to think we are). But, later, when I proudly told one of our other friends my happy news, I had my share of being teased.  She told me I acted too much like a fan.  And, here's what I said, "I AM a fan! And, Ala knows that!" :)  Last night was a great night for we saw a great play and we met Ala.  The night will forever stay in my memory for it was a night that taught me a thing or two.  It was the first time I ever acted too "fan-y" and that made me realize that it's actually okay to lower yourself and just look up to another person, that at times I could and should swallow my pride (I'm usually quite proud) and act in a way I don't usually do for what will make me happy.  After that, I also came to understand how and why "shriekin' fans" act the way they do.  I found out that it wasn't bad at all, that it even felt great within!  And most especially, I realized that Ala is just like me and everyone I know.  She's but an ordinary person, who can be friends with another ordinary person.    And, after all these, I go on to proclaim myself as the no. 1 ALA-ist in the world! :)

        I am so sad right now.  Early in the morning the day before yesterday (about 2:30), we went to take our dormmate, Naonao, to the airport.  We wanted to keep her company in her last few hours here in Manila (for the time being).  God only knows when we’ll all see her again.  It was one of those moments when you just wish time would just stop.  It was one of those moments where you, with a heavy heart, reluctantly face one of life's most cruel realities- that nothing really lasts forever.  Forgive my being too sentimental about this…  It’s just that I feel like a chapter in my life has ended with our dear Naonao's leaving.    Naonao is, or I should say was, a dorm-mate.  Her room is just across mine.  We didn’t really become “friendly friends” until after her first semester of stay in the dorm.  It’s funny every time we think about it.  The first time we “really” talked was one night when the lights (power) in her room didn’t work and she had to study for an exam.  What she did was she kept her door open and studied on the floor, just by the door, the whole night.  Seeing her, I decided to sit and join her.  We got to talking and soon, we were there just laughing our heads off.  That was the beginning of our friendship.    From then on, Naonao and I always took lunch and dinner together.  She would jokingly say, “You’ll never eat alone.”  That statement would basically tell you what kind of person she is.  She’s the kind who would stick by you and stay with you at all times.  I have always had a hard time sleeping at night, so what she would do is join me and try her best to keep her sleepy eyes from closing.  She would listen to me rant, rave, whine and just plain complain about anything and everything.  She would laugh at my jokes as if they were the funniest she’s ever heard.  She never failed to boost my confidence whenever I felt low.  She never failed to make me (us) laugh with her cute antics, cool dance steps, and wild ideas.  She never failed to amaze me (us) with her great talent, immense patience and great ability in learning new things.   Even if she was hurt and mad at somebody, the most she would do is cry herself to sleep.  She really showed how and what it was to be a real friend!  In the short time that we were together, she became no less than a confidante, a bosom friend, a sister…    She decided to take a  Leave of Absence  from her college, after a year of studying, and try her luck in the “real” outside world.  She went back to where her heart really was.  She went home and I know that she will be happiest there.  As for me, I know dorm life will never ever be the same without her, but life goes on.  Yeah, I am still sad and I still cry...  But, right now, I choose to be happy!:)

        I am  24  today!    I don’t really have anything in mind to write about today.  I mean, every time I try to think of something decent to write, my mind goes totally academic and all (Yeah right, I wish!).  This is because I have my mind totally bent on finishing all the things I need to write and finish this semester!  I do not want to have anymore INCs, for God’s sake!  Once and for all, I think I have learned my lesson!:)  So, what I’m going to do instead is post on this blog something (part of a long and very personal ‘essay’) that I wrote for the very person who means the whole world to me…  MY MOM !  I wrote this on her 58th birthday.  And, today, as I celebrate my 24th birthday, I think it is best that I honor the person responsible for my coming into this world.  She is, after all, the person I most look up to and I most want to be like.  To the very best mom in the whole world, this is for you…   ***********    December 12, 2003   December 12…  Today is the birthday of a very important and special person…  Fifty-eight wonderful years ago, in 1945, a cute, little baby girl was born.  She was the first daughter of her parents and was truly a gift from God Almighty.  She was named Potre.  This little girl came to be one of the brainiest among her peers and contemporaries.  She made clear the expressions “small, but terrible” and “girl power”.  She was loved and respected by everyone around her.  She grew up to be one of the most respected, well-loved, most intelligent women in her place…  one of the few women to have made a difference… the first Meranao woman CPA… the best wife a man could have and wish for… the best mother a child can have and ask for…  MY MOTHER !!!  My mother is the strongest person I know.  What with all the pains, heartaches, disappointments, frustrations, and ‘sufferings’ she has gone through, she has remained steadfast and untainted.  She makes the world a better place by showering love and that beautiful, beautiful smile that she always flashes all around her.  She is not perfect, for no one is perfect, but she truly is close to being perfect.  She’s beautiful, hard-working, intelligent, honest, wise, endowed with leadership, and good-hearted.  She really is the best!  She wants me to be the best in the world and I do, too (who doesn’t?).  She wants me to dream big and follow all my dreams to reality.  She wants me to go to places she never had the chance to go to.  And, the last thing I want in this world is to fail her.  She gives me hope, strength and courage.  She is my life and my soul.  Every time I’d feel like giving up, I’d only have to think and reflect on my mother for a few minutes and I realize that I just cannot, must not give up.  I definitely cannot fail her.  It’s the only thing I can give her after everything that she’s given me (us).    I believe that now is the time for me to start giving her back, even in the littlest way, the things that she gave up for me (us).  I should work as hard as I could if only to make her smile and proudly say, “My baby… that is my daughter who makes me truly happy.”  There is nothing in this world that I want more than to give my mother and father happiness and pride.  To give them back the love that they have given us and do anything and everything for them are my most important missions in life.  My success will be theirs.  All my work and achievement were, are and will forever be for them.  This is the only way I know how to repay them.  Not that it is needed in this life, but still, I know and feel that I owe them everything… I owe them my life… especially my mother.  For her, I will be the best that I can be… For her, I will strive until I reach the top… For her, I will do my best in every endeavor I undertake.  I will summon the stars and moon and reach out to them until I could touch them with my fingers and present them to the world and to my mother most importantly.  For her, I will live, love and enjoy this world.  For her, I will be the most beautiful person.  For her, I will give all.  And, at the end of it all, I shall smile, with my mother, to and at the world and sing in my loudest, merriest voice.  I do everything and live for her mainly… then for the rest of my family and my people… and then, for myself.  Insha-Allah!

        Bokelo…  This is the Meranao word for “lazy” or someone who “masters the art of idleness”, as my dad would put it.  This is exactly what I am!  I haven’t been going to the Net centers as much as I would want to because if I did I would totally feel guilty about it.  Yes, that’s right, guilty!  Why?  Well, because I have to do and finish nine papers, study for three exams and prepare for one last report before the semester ends (and that’s two weeks away).  But then, come to think of it, I haven’t really done much yet!  So, now I’m wondering why I had to feel guilty over going to the Net centers, checking my Friendster, blogging, chatting, forum hopping at Peyups and RiceBowl…  I mean, with or without the Internet as a distraction, I haven’t really moved any closer to getting all the things I need to finish done anyway!  Whose fault is that?  Nobody’s!  It all falls down to, I am a freakin’ BOKELO!!!    So, anyway, here I am blogging and doing what I’ve wanted most to do these past few days. Maybe after this, I could get on with what I should have been doing for months now!  I just want to get something out of my stream.  This is, after all, what blogging is for, isn’t it?  A person very, very close to my heart revealed something to me that has kept me wondering and thinking.  At first, it totally freaked me out and I just couldn’t believe it.  But now, honestly, I am very happy for her because finally she has decided to face the truth and, in doing so, has set herself free.  She is very happy now, I can feel that.  I will try my best to put how she feels into this entry.  The "I" will be her (i.e. "I" will try to put myself in her shoes).    Mad Love…   I am in love… again!  It’s a beautiful feeling.  It feels like nothing could ever break or disturb the serenity and happiness I’m feeling.  It’s as if such happiness never, ever felt before is all around me that I’m almost suffocated by its powerful grip.  Every single day, I am enveloped in such wonderful embrace and taken to a place where I could forever stay in and would willingly give anything up for.  The feeling is so strong that life just stops turning the usual way it does.  Everything just goes tupsy-turvy, but nothing bothers me, none at all…   I see my “beloved” in such beautiful light.  I can forever look into such magical soul through those beautiful, beautiful eyes.  I can forever stare at that simple, wonderful face gifted with such sweet smile and so much love emanating.  I could just get lost in all the adventure and fun such great mind promises.  I could listen to that wonderful, hearty laugh for an eternity.  I could forever be awed by such wit with swordlike sharpness.  I could follow such great person anywhere and everywhere for the rest of my life.  An effect of peace, contentment and genuine happiness results from sensing the nearness of our bodies, our hearts.  I could just die at this moment loving every single thing in and about such “great gift that God must have spent a little more time on”, as the Alabama song goes.  Had I my way, I would just dirft away to the Place of No Return with the “beloved” as the last sight my mortal eyes would lay on.   At this moment, loving the “beloved”  is one of the few things that keep me going.  The “beloved” may appear to be quite your ordinary person.  But, after some time and getting to know the strength and magic of such character, I know that I’ve found such treasure that could never, ever be equaled.  Everything is just perfect, just truly wonderful.  Love is given a new and better meaning…  so is life!   The “beloved” is my world, my life, my everything, my whole being…    I love the way I feel.  It’s as if I am finally free to fly.  Life will never be the same for it has been shaken and forever altered by the power of such real/true love.  I have never felt so at peace with everything in the whole universe as I do now.  I have never had the chance to know such person like the “beloved”.  I have never felt so strongly for someone…  I don’t care if I watch such great presence from afar.  I don’t care if I never have the chance to touch, to hold such beauty.  I don’t care if my love forever remains a secret.  I don’t care if this, one day, passes.  I don’t care if we’re of the same sex…  Right now, she is my happiness…  happiness beyond belief and words!:)  *** **** ***  I just hope I was able to give justice to how she feels.  If she gets to read this, I would just like to say, "THIS IS FOR YOU, FRIEND!" :)

        About two weeks ago,  Phoebe Buffay  (my baby/cat) gave birth to four cute kittens.  My sister and I were really excited about it and we already decided which kitten would belong to each of us (one for me, one for my sister, one for our brother and, lastly, one for the helper).   Phoebs  brought her "babies" from the secret place where she gave birth in to my locker.  There were nights we couldn't sleep because the little ones sang us " meow-meow " songs (someimes to our dismay!).  We couldn't wait for them to grow big so we could play with them.  But, all of a sudden,  Phoebs  got sick.  Maybe, she ate something.  For three whole days, she couldn't eat.  She couldn't even walk two steps.  She was just so weak.  I fed her through a dropper.  Everyone (except me) thought she would die.  Every single night, I'd stay with her, praying and crying at the same time.  It was total torture for me.  I was so scared and worried.  After those dreadful days, she miraculously gained a little strength and was able to eat a little.  But, she still couldn't feed her "babies".  She was sick for a week, and so, one by one, the dear little ones died.  It was really sad, especially knowing and thinking that we couldn't do anything about it.  There are no vets here.  I played doctor to  Phoebs , but the poor kittens, I (we) couldn't save them. :-(  Now, Phoebs is okay.  She's a little weak still, but she has gone back to her old self again, sometimes even playing with  Dugong  (my sis' cat), who is also on the family way. :-)    And, another thing is that I have a new baby (kitten).  He was given to me by my brother's girlfriend.  He's a super sweet and lovable little guy.  He's been with me all but two days and we are just so much in love.  He sleeps on my hair...  Hehehe:-)  After losing four "grandkittens", God has given me (us) one to fill the space/place left by our "angel kittens"... :-)

        Ever since I started studying in Manila, going home has become the most exciting and most awaited part of the year for me.  Last time I went home (summer last year), I had been away for two whole years.   You could just imagine how much I missed MSU!  I couldn’t even sit still for days just thinking about home.  The moment my foot touched MSU ground, I was just ecstatic.  The clean, fresh and cold MSU air made me happier than I had ever been in the past two years.  I mean, after almost sweating myself to death in Manila with its heat, feeling the cold MSU air and seeing the MSU fog made me so happy I could barely stop myself from crying.  Add to that my excitement about seeing people I love and people I grew up with.  Now, I’ve again come home after a whole year of being away and I feel exactly the same.  I have been here a week and the excitement and happiness grows day by day.  I’ll be here for two whole months.  Yay!!!   I really, really missed MSU.  The cold wind, fresh air, the fog, the cold water (read: I still can’t take a bath without boiling water first!), the golf course, Commercial Center, the King Faisal Mosque, the ascending road, the trees, our house, Darling’s chicken barbecue, Phoebe Buffay (the cat), my family and friends, and so many other things found only in MSU!  MSU (that is Main Campus in Marawi City, of course, because there are some seven MSU campuses all over Mindanao) is my favorite place in the whole world.  It’s one of the places I would describe as ‘heaven on earth’ because of every single thing about it.  It’s really nice to be in a place where everybody knows everybody, where everything and everyone is familiar.  It’s always good to be in a place where everything is just so cheap that ordering a P50 meal would be considered outrageously expensive!  It’s cool to be in a place where you can just be who you are and you can do whatever you want to do.  But, most of all, it feels great to be where one’s heart is.  It is always great to be home.    Here are some pictures I took…      I took this while on the plane...:)   Here are pictures of MSU...     View from my window...       The MSU sign at the Golf Course      MSU Golf Course      MSU Golf Course: View from the top...      This is "Tagaytay"...      ...where we usually hang out. :)     More pictures to come....  Hehehe:)

        To take a break from the sleepless days and nights I spent working (say cramming) on my final papers, I decided to go stroll, with some friends, around the campus.  We did the usual talking, laughing and just relaxing.  Since they brought food with them, we decided to take our late-lunch somewhere in the campus.  We walked around some more and finally settled to sit and eat at  The Lagoon  (a popular place to  Peyups  people).  We stayed there for more than four hours doing nothing, buying and eating things sold around the place.  Aah, there's really nothing like a hanging out with old friends.:)  While we were there chatting and laughing over nothing and everything, two very "in heat" cats decided to join us.  They were obviously hoping to have some of our goodies thrown to them.  Of course, we gave them what they came for (the food), but they got more.  As they lay lazing around the place, I was just so amused at them that I instantly decided to have them as my very fisrt " official models " for my long-planned  photo portfolio .:)  With my new camera in hand, I just let my excited, trigger happy self click away!  To my utter delight and amusement, the cats turned out to be  experienced models .  Here are my favorite shots.  I just love cats!!!                 Aren't cats just lovable?!!  Enough said...:)  MEOW!!!   *** **** ***   Me and My Friends...   Here are photos of me and my friends.:)         Leelah and me... Aren't we beautiful? Oh, but look at those eye bags! Tsk, tsk, tsk...      Dean and I... Whatchatink?!:)

        For my birthday, I got myself a new digital camera!  I have always wanted to get a good camera for as long as I can remember.  I have always been interested in photography, but I couldn't really buy one because that would be too much of a luxury (and I couldn't afford to get myself one, anyway!).   But, after saving for some months, saving the birthday cash-gift given to me by my parents and my aunt, saving some of the money I earned from my part-time job, I finally got my dream digital camera last week!!!:)   Now...  I can take pictures of anything I want.  I can finally take a picture of the view of that  Iglesia ni Cristo  church from the  UP Sports Oval  which never fails to take my breath away every single afternoon I pass by it.  I can take pictures of God's magnificence (nature).  I can take pictures of kids playing and running around.  I can take pictures of students around the  UP Sunken Garden  and the soccer players in the field.  I can take pictures of those  Atenistas  and  LaSallistas  playing  American Football  at the  Sports Oval .  I can take pictures of lovers and/or friends, under the shade of trees, lost in their own worlds.  I can take pictures of dogs sniffing around the campus.  I can take pictures of cute, lazy cats lying around the place.  I can take pictures of my beautiful, wacky, crazy friends!  I can take pictures of my cute nephews and nieces.  I can take pictures of my sister in all her moods.  I can take pictures of loved-ones.  I can take pictures of dear, dear  MSU !  I can take pictures that would always make me remember places and things not worth forgetting.  I can take pictures of anything and everything!:)  I am just so excited I can't stop grinning from ear to ear!  Wait, I think I need to take a picture of myself... now!:)

        Another term of the  MSU College Bound Program  ended last Saturday.  It was another unforgettable experience (as always).  The  MSU-CBP  is a summer program that serves as the training ground for incoming freshmen students in MSU.  It is a program unique to the Mindanao State University.  Our Pre-University Center Director has described it as "a special program for special people" because the students are those who were baccalaureate and conditional passers in the MSU-System Admission and Scholarship Examination.  Since last year, we have also opened the program to Special Scholars so that they may not have a very hard time maintaining their scholarship grants.  In the  CBP , we train and prepare students for college.  We review their English and Math and teach them new techniques and lessons.  We also try to inculcate good morals through Values Education.  Basically, the  CBP  is like an extension of high school.  It's really fun for both students and teachers.  I have been with the  CBP  for six years now (I still can't believe it's been that long!).  It is where I learned to appreciate and understand my teachers and their efforts.  It is where I came to see how important teachers are and how tough their job is.  Before my  CBP  experience, not even in my dreams did I have any interest in teaching.  I wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer, a dentist. I wanted to be lots of things, but never a teacher.  I knew that teaching was a low paying job and I thought it was the most boring job in the world, what with all the monotony and the routines.  The only instance I remember about me wanting to be a teacher was when I was in 1st Grade.  I wanted so much to be a teacher because I liked to check the attendance.  My mom and aunts gave me this columnar notebook where I wrote all the names of the people in their office.  Every single day, I'd check their attendance.  But after a while, the excitement wore off and I forgot how I wanted to be a teacher.  It was summer back in 1998 (after my second year in college) when I volunteered for the  CBP .  Because we were student volunteers, we were called "tutors".  Our job was to review the day's lessons and make sure that the students understand everything.  Normally, a tutor would be working with one to about three or four students, but ours was different.  We were not really tutors for we were like real teachers.  Our setting was the normal classroom setting.  We had a course syllabus to follow and things like that.  Our job was not only to develop their writing and grammar skills, but their oral skills as well.  We also tried to develop their self-confidence by training them in oration, singing, declamation, etc.  This was my very first "job" ever.  It was then that I realized that teaching is not as bad I thought it was.  Teaching was actually fun and teachers get to learn so much and get to meet different kinds of people.  After that first summer, I volunteered in the  CBP  every single year until I graduated.  But, it didn't end there for as soon as I graduated, I was taken in as one of the faculty.  Being a regular faculty, a real teacher, was tougher than being just a mere tutor.  But, I realized that the tougher it got, the more I liked it.  It would always make me feel so good when I saw my students get the lesson.  It's always a joy to see those smiles of satisfaction.   "Ah okay!"  and  "Ah, I see!"  would always be music to my ears.  Seeing my students improve satisfies and fulfills me more (much, much more) than seeing my own grades improve.  The feeling that teaching gives me is just indescribable.    Teaching is said to be noblest of jobs.  I, myself, don't really see myself as someone noble or anything, but I know most teachers are.  As for me, as a young teacher, teaching has taught me so much.  It has given me patience, perseverance, contentment and compassion among others.  Teaching, after all, is learning.  It's a wonderful experience.  From the very first moment I stepped inside that classroom and started my lesson, I knew that this was my calling.  From the moment I saw that very first "nod of comprehension", I just fell in love with teaching.  I may become lots of other things in the future, but I will forever remain to be a teacher.

        Your Brain Usage Profile:  Auditory : 38% Visual : 61% Left : 47% Right : 52%   BabyPink, you exhibit an even  balance between left- and right- hemisphere dominance  and a slight preference for visual over auditory processing. With a score this balanced, it is likely that you would have slightly different results each time you complete this self-assessment quiz.   You are a well-rounded person, distinctly individualistic and artistic, an active and multidimensional learner. At the same time, you are logical and disciplined, can operate well within an organization, and are sensitive towards others without losing objectivity. You are organized and goal-directed. Although a "thinking" individual, you "take in" entire situations readily and can act on intuition.   You sometimes tend to vacillate in your learning styles. Learning might take you longer than someone of equal intellect, but you will tend to be more thorough and retain the material longer than those other individuals. You will alternate between logic and impulse. This vacillation will not normally be intentional or deliberate, so you may experience anxiety in situations where you are not certain which aspect of yourself will be called on.   With a slight preference for visual processing, you tend to be encompassing in your perceptions, process along multidimensional paths and be active in your attacking of situations or learning.   Overall, you should feel content with your life and yourself. You are, perhaps, a little too critical of yourself -- and of others -- while maintaining an "openness" which tempers that tendency. Indecisiveness is a problem and your creativity may not be in keeping with your potential. Being a pragmatist, you downplay this aspect of yourself and focus on the more immediate, obvious and the more functional    Click   urlLink here   to know your brain usage profile.     ***********************   I got the link from MJ's site.

        I have been wanting to blog about my enrollment and my subjects/courses this semester, but I decided to wait until I cooled down a bit so that I will be able to think straight and see the bright side of everything.  I know how totally annoying it is (at times) to read about somebody just plain ranting and raving about how circumstances and all the powers in this universe are working together to ruin one's life.  I mean, I don't have anything against people writing about every single bad thing about their lives that you, sometimes, can't help but feel and say, "Oh, f*ck, life's really a bitch and there is absolutely nothing good about it!"  It's just that sometimes I can only take so much ranting and raving.  But then again, what are blogs for?  And, I find it nice that some people use blogging to at least free themselves from all the feeling of strangulation that life (being a bitch) gives them.  I will really try to be NOT one of those people who only see the negative.  Hmm, so help me, God...:)   ***********************   Okay, so enrollment in UP was June 2-14 and I went to the campus as early as June 2.  Amazingly, I finished everything in less than two hours.  That's because everyone's thinking that it would be better to start in the later days because that way others would have been done with their enrollment so there'll be few people in line and all.  Wrong!  People here seem to think alike so that come the last day of late registration, there's still a LOT of people standing in line that you'll have to wait a long time to have your turn.  Anyway, I took two courses, English 206 (The Structure of English) and English 207 (Semantics).  These are the only courses offered that I haven't taken yet.  I need to take  9 units so I can start writimg my thesis next semester.  I was really hoping and planning to take 295 (Colloquium), but it wasn't offered!  So, there... everything I planned out for the whole year was ruined!  Just because I couldn't take the course, I won't be able to finish on time!  Just because the course was not offered, I can't start my proposal!  Just because I couldn't take the course, I'll have to suspend all my "great" plans for one more year.  And, I couldn't petition for the course because I was the only one who really needed it this semester.  Other English majors have either taken the course or do not really need it at this time.  Oh, man!  Just when I thought I was really focused and bent on finishing the soonest possible time, this had to happen.  I was really pissed big time - beyond words!    But, then, as I tried to think about it after all the self-pitying and feeling ruined, I came to realize that there's a bright side to this.  I relized that because I will be delayed in my getting a Masters degree, I will have more time to be a student and enjoy living the life of one for a bit longer.  I will have more time to do research and really decide on what to write on in my thesis.  I will have more time to be in the safety of the school gates, so that I won't have to really face the "big, bad wolf" of the "real world out there" that's ready to pounce on anyone who comes in close proximity with it.  I realized that I will have more time to spend with my friends.  I realized that I will have all the time to think of what career path I really want!  And, I realized I will have more time to apply for other scholarships that might possibly come my way.  Hmm, so not being able to take 295 and being delayed in my graduation isn't really that bad after all.  Of course, there are a number of really "bad" things/consequences that come with it, like additional expenses for my parents and me among others.  But, I prefer not to think of these at this time.  I choose to see this as a "blessing in disguise" and it is (will be).:)

          "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."    This opening sentence of Jane Austen's " Pride and Prejudice " cannot be more true in our culture, the  Meranao  culture.  I remember, about four or five years ago, there was this  "Darcy-ish"  young man who came "home" to our place after growing up somewhere else.  He was the scion of a political and rich clan.  He was a lawyer (fresh from the Bar exams at that time, I think).  Oh, and he was quite good looking, too.  He was, obviously, a jackpot prize wanted not only by mothers who had daughters, but by the daughters as well.    I remember laughing whenever I saw him, in numerous occasions, being swarmed by females of all ages.  There were some who were my mom's age wanting to introduce their daughters to the "man of the hour".  There were also young women his age and slightly older and/or younger than he was.  These women looked like hungry beggars lining up for free food.  Honestly, that was how I saw them.  I also remember that during that time about 70% of all conversations involved him or somebody linked to him.  He was truly a celebrity.  I cannot imagine how he took all these.  I mean, growing up in another place, our culture was totally alien to him.  I (we) have proven this when once he came out on TV and talked about our culture and it was obvious that he didn't know what he was talking about.  He was just completely lost.  Even his cousins (friends of mine) were saying, "Oh, what the f*ck are you saying?!  Wala namang alam 'to eh! (This one doesn't know anything!)"  Sheesh, that's the celebrity you worshipped?!  I wanted to say to many people.    Anyway, back to my story, everyone was convinced that he came home to actually find a nice young woman he could marry.  Well, that was actually what his family planned for him.  So many rumors came out about what kind of woman he wanted.  There was even something as stupid as he would only marry a girl who looked like Dawn Zulueta.  I couldn't help but laugh at this.  I was thinking, "why didn't he go marry Ms. Zulueta herself then?!"  People were debating about who was best for him.  Funny because these people didn't even know him.  All these lasted a few months.  Everything ended and came to a stop when, all of a sudden, he went back to Manila because he couldn't survive in Marawi.  Well, after all the rumors and all the mothers hounding him as though they were all possessed, I wouldn't blame the guy for wanting to escape.  The next thing we knew, he married his college sweetheart in Manila.  And then, that was it...  The time to look for another "celebrity" had come.  It's really funny how people are sometimes.  I mean, look at how those parents were so bent on marrying off their daughters to THE celebrity.  What the guy thought or sometimes what the daughters thought weren't even considered.  But, can we blame the parents for wanting "the best" for their children?  Hmmm, oh well...  Oh, and I might as well add my own improvised quote that may very well express another notion very much believed and accepted in our culture...  "It is a truth generally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of a good fortune and/or good education is in want of a husband... fast!"   Aaaarrrggghhhh!!!!!  Laugh with me... Nyahahahaha!:)

         Hmm, it's been a while since I last posted an entry. I haven't been hanging around the Internet Centers/Cafes during my last days at home. I wanted to make the most of those days hanging out with friends and family. After all, I am not going to see most of them for a year (or maybe more). But, now that I'm back in Manila again, I'm back to blogging, as well.:)   During my last days in MSU, I had a pretty hectic schedule. There were many things to do, many places and friends to go and visit. Even with the elections over, there was still so much to do. The whole family was just so busy that we barely saw one another. I think I am the only one in my whole family who's not interested in politics. Some uncles and cousins ran for office so one could just imagine how busy everyone got. Good thing I had the CBP as an excuse for not going with them as they campaigned.   But, after the CBP and after May 10, I had no more excuse so I had to go with them as we waited for the results in the headquarters. Almost all my cousins served as "watchers" during the counting. It's really weird how people sort of get into a frenzy during election time. Everyone gets into this never-ending excitement and almost every conversation is about the elections or politics in general. I admit that I also get a little excited about these things and I, sometimes, like to talk about politics. I just don't want my life to be all about politics (like some people I know). Besides, politics here in the Philippines really turns me off!   Different people have different opinions and thoughts about things, right? Yeah, that's why I'm different from almost every member of my family. Venturing into politics or having a position is not the only way one can help his/her people. If one really wants to be of service to others, there are lots of other venues. So, I'll just leave politics to others and others should also leave me be...:)

        The past few nights, I had so many things in mind that I wanted to write/blog about.  Every time I’d lie down to sleep, these ideas start to creep into my mind and I’d feel so excited I couldn’t wait for morning to come.  But, now that I’m sitting in front of this Net Café’s PC, I can’t seem to decide what to write about.  No, no, make that I can’t think of a really good thing to write!  It’s so irritating and really frustrating!  Now, I completely understand what Kencho Suematsu meant when he said,  “…she wrote down immediately, in order not to allow the inspiration of the moment to be lost, ” about  Lady Murasaki  (the author of  Genji Monogatari , the world’s very first novel, which I’m reading with great enjoyment and interest right now).  Hay!   Thinking…  Thinking…  Thinking… :)    Jeepney rides...   Okay, what comes to mind right now is something that I see or observe daily (ever since I came to Manila), i.e. some of the people I ride with in jeepneys.  It always bothers me how some people who take the jeepney have a problem with passing other people’s fare to the driver.  You’ll need to make your voice really loud just so they’ll look at you and, most of the times, they'd totally ignore you and refuse to take the money from your iutstretched hand.  They just look past you and play deaf and blind.  At times, it really takes all my courage to stop myself from throwing the money, along with whatever I have in my hands, to this kind of people!    What if they were the ones sitting farthest from the driver?  Wouldn’t they eventually pass their fare to other people?  Where has cooperation gone?  It’s really crazy!    But, it’s surprising how many people are like this.  And, I find this really sad.  I mean, this is but a small help one can readily extend to a fellow human being.  It’s not like it would totally exhaust you or anything.  It’s just passing something from another person to another.  It’s not like what you’re asked to pass weighs a ton or something.  It is no big deal, right?  Now, why is it so hard for some people to do others such a little favor?  I don’t think I will ever understand this!    And, my God, don’t get me started with people who seem to have never heard of “thank you” or “salamat”!  Tsk, tsk, tsk…:(    ***********************     Ranao Royalty in Reality...   I really don't know where some people (here in the Philippines) get the idea that almost all, if not all, Muslim Filipinos have royal blood.  I have been asked the question " Prinsesa ka ba? " (Are you a princess?) a gazillion times!  Most of the time, I'd dismiss the question with a joke.  Sometimes, I wouldn't know what to say.    Yes, there really are princes/princesses in our place, but they are not anything like the idea that we have of princes/princesses (in history books or in fairy tales).  The  'Meranao Royalty'  has become a joke, if you ask me.  I mean, here's the picture, every single municipality in  Lanao del Sur  has its own royal family.  Some even have numerous since any respectable person can claim to be royalty in a single barangay.  People have created all sorts of titles just to accomodate all these social climbers (I used this not to look down on these people but due to a lack of a better term).  You'd see all sorts of streamers about this person's and that's enthronement.  It's very interesting, really, but sometimes it can be irritating!  Royal titles have (sadly) become mere names, nowadays.    But, there are, of course, families who have 'real royal blood' running through their veins.  These families, even if they're no longer in the limelight or however you may term it, are still very much respected.  These families are, as they'd say, legal claimants of the Royal Houses of Ranao (Lanao).  They are descendants of great, powerful  sultans .  Members of these families can rightfully become  sultan s and  bai a labi s not only in one municipality, but two, three, four or even more.  These people, more often than not, do not so much concern themselves with enthronements or whatever because their being royal is in their blood and family names.  Some of these people live middle class lives and not the rich lives you'd imagine royal families would live.  Members of these families live simple lives, nowadays.  Some don't have much wealth anymore.  If you were an outsider, you would only find out that some of these people are of royal lineage when you get to meet their relatives and see how they are treated.  No, people do not bow to them or anything.  They do not extend their hands to be kissed by the "subordinates".  But, they are treated with more tact.  If you were a keen observer, you'll really notice the difference.  And, no person, who comes from these families' "hometown", in his right mind, would dare insult them or dream of doing such thing.  Just some weeks ago, my niece was asked the very question " Prinsesa ka ba? " and, shy person that she is, she replied with an awkward "yes".  Her friend exclaimed, " Wow, really?! So, may binabayaran ba kayong mga tao para paypayan ka tuwing nagsta-study ka? " (So, there are people hired to fan you when you study your lessons?)   My niece was taken aback by this and she said, " Of course not! OA naman 'yun! " (Of course not!  That's too much!)  When she related this to me I told her that the next time somebody asked her that, just say, " Nge! Ganyan ba kami ka-backward?! Why on earth would I need to hire somebody to fan me when we have air con naman?! Du-uh!!! " (Is that how backward you think our lifestyle is?! Why...)   People, sometimes...  haaayy!:)

      After reading   urlLink Balbonics  ' and   urlLink Dominattyrix  's posts on the cute avatar/icons that anyone can create at   urlLink this site  , I also thought of creating MY avatar/icon.&nbsp; And, here is what I came up with.      My friend (JanJan) and I both think this is how I look like.  Okay, okay... I look like a  happy cancer patient , but I think people who really know me and who've seen me will agree that I look like the icon.  After all, I hardly ever go out without my veil.  And, of course, you can NOT not notice how my icon self is wearing a pink shirt/sweater and a pink scarf.  Oh, and the background (which is partly hidden) is the gate of the  Sensoji (Asakusa Kannon Temple)  in  Tokyo , where I actually posed in and had my photo taken almost four years ago.:)  And, who's that little cute fellow in my hands?  That's Shan Cai, my aunt's cute spoiled brat of a cat!  Here's another look at her.:)    This one doesn't know she's a cat!  Tihihihi!:)

        I finally decided to change my template.  At first, I had such a hard time imagining changing my template because my older template was a product of sleepless nights, sweat, and tears.  Yes, tears!  I started blogging whith zero knowledge of html and those other things (that I still don't know a thing about).  But, with trial and error combined with all the patience I could muster, I was able to make a quite decent looking blog.  Of course, I was so happy and so proud of it.  It was like my "baby" or something.  Y'know, like when people have projects and they call them their babies.  I felt that way.  But last night, I went to the Net Cafe I always went to and found out that they've swtched from internet explorer to mozilla firefox.  I checked my blog, as usual, and found that it looked weird in firefox.  I know it looked weird in Apple Macs, too, because I once used a Mac at the UP Computer Center.  I don't really know why.  My tagboard isn't where it's supposed to be, etc.  I didn't like that.  I wanted my blog to , well, look the same no matter what browser (or PC at that) I use.  So, finally, with tears welling up in my eyes, I said goodbye to my "baby".  I checked the "ready-made" templates that good ol' Blogger offers and saw that there were so many available designs.  Why, when I started there were only about five or six (very plain and simple) designs!  And, imagine my happiness when my eyes fell on Ms. Moto's design!  I'd say, it's SOOO me! It's so  pink  that I really felt it was made especially for me.  Suddenly, I forgot half of my sadness.  I knew I'd found the perfect template for me (while I still can't design my own)!    Of course, I still had to spend one whole night for this "new look" because of the freakin' add-ons!  And, I still can't get my haloscan comment board back!  I'll be working on that more later.:) Oh, but I activated my Blogger comment board (Oceanic Thoughts). ( If you want to comment, please do so. And, if you're a non-Blogger (read: user of other blog services other than Blogger/Blogspot), like my friend   urlLink Balbonics   said, please be a friend and post your name. )  So, there you have it... MY NEW BABY!    The Ocean of My Being   with a new look.:)  Nothing special really, just wanted to blog about it.  Hehehe:)

        It’s amazing and funny how life teaches us new lessons even in the most ordinary of days.  The most usual scenes of everyday life would sometimes make us learn a thing or two on how to live.  Last Tuesday, I met with a friend at Greenbelt.  Two scenes from that day will forever remain in my memory because they made me think and make a decision about how I want to be as a person and how I want to live.     At the MRT…   The Quezon Avenue Station was not as swarmed as I expected it to be when I got there.  As soon as I got my ticket, I joined the army of people rushing to the platform to get on the train that just came to a stop.  As I positioned myself on the yellow arrow markers where the door opened, I couldn’t help but notice an oldish (about 58 to 60-ish) lady, first because she was dressed in pink and then I couldn’t help but admire how strong she still was.  I mean, she ran with the rest of the crowd her crown of pure white hair making her stand out.  And then, I noticed that she looked familiar or she reminded me of someone I knew.  And it dawned on me, she looked like  Mamoosh  (my   urlLink  Tita Pie   ’s mom).    As soon as we got inside the train, people scrambled around to get seats. It was good that there weren’t many people already in the train.  Most of us got seats.  And then, I noticed, at the far side just in front of the door, the “ pink lady ” was standing clutching her bag in one hand and the steel bar in the other.  All around her, younger people were sitting comfortably.  I looked at her and I wanted so much to offer my seat.  We even had eye-to-eye contact for a few seconds, and just as  Mamoosh  would do, she smiled at me.  I looked down thinking that if I gave her my seat, I’d have to cross over to where she was, which was a little bit far.  What if as soon as I stood up, somebody took my seat?  I debated within myself about what to do and I looked at her again.  She was looking out the window deep in thought, it seemed.  She looked exhausted.  That very scene of an oldish woman standing up while we, younger people, sat comfortably around her really bothered me.  My conscience wouldn’t keep me still and made me think, what if it was actually  Mamoosh  or worse what if it was my own  Mommy .  What if  Mamoosh  and/or  Mommy  got on the MRT dead tired and just like this “ pink lady ”, they’d have to stand because nobody would offer them seats.  Thinking of that, I couldn’t stop my tears from falling.  It was a good thing I had my veil so I could cover my face a bit and wipe my tears immediately, but the tears wouldn’t stop.   By the time I decided to really offer my seat, we were on our second stop and the girl seated next to where the “ pink lady ” was standing stood up to go.  The “ pink lady ” sat on the vacated seat with a huge smile on her face and a sigh of relief.  I, on the other hand, was kicking myself for not deciding soon enough to offer my seat.  Why couldn’t I have decided sooner?  The “ pink lady ’s” smile made me feel worse.  I decided then and there that the next time I’ll be in the same situation, there won’t be any debate within, there won’t be any hesitation.  I will do what I have to do as soon as opportunity to do it comes.  In doing so, I will think of  Mommy  or  Mamoosh  being offered a seat or any help at all by a stranger.  I will be so much thankful to that stranger for being a good person.    At the Ladies Room…   Now, this one is quite funny.  After downing several glasses of iced tea, my friend and I had to go to the Ladies Room.  As soon as we got to the Ladies Room, we came face to face with a girl (in office uniform) talking to another girl in one of the cubicles.  They were obviously arguing.  My friend and I did what we came for and checked ourselves in the mirror.  The whole time, we couldn’t help but listen to the very “interesting” discourse.  Here’s how it went...   Girl 1:  Why do you have to take so much?  Couldn’t you just buy your own or something? Girl 2:  What?!  Eh, it’s free nga eh.  It’s for everybody. Girl 1:  That’s the point.  It’s for everybody so it’s not for you lang, ‘di ba?  O, if you were Ayala, would you like if somebody took all the tissue from your CR?  You’re Christian pa naman.  (While saying this, she shot my friend and me a shy glance.  I don’t know why, maybe because my friend and I were both wearing veil.) Girl 2:  Ano?! (What?!)  Are you telling me I’m doing something immoral?! Girl 1:  Yes, that’s stealing.   At this moment, three more confused people came and gave us ‘what’s-happening-here’ kind of looks.  I could just shrug.  My friend was taking such a long time “retouching”.   Girl 2 (now out of the cubicle):  Hay, ewan ko sa’yo!  Ang dami mong issues!  (I don’t know!  You have lots of issues!) Girl 1:  Hindi ako ang maraming issues. (I’m not the one with lots of issues.) Girl 2:  Hello?!  Tissue lang ‘yun…  (It’s only tissue…) Girl 1:  No, that’s stealing.  There is something wrong with your Christianity!  Girl 2:  Baka ikaw… (Maybe, you’re the one…) Girl 1:  Oh yeah?! I’m not the one going out with an attached man! Girl 2:  Ah, so ‘yan pala ang pinupunto mo. Lumabas din! (So, that’s what you were driving at!) Girl 1:  Yeah! Girl 2:  We’re not doing anything wrong, okay?  We just go out and talk as friends.  There’s nothing immoral in that! Girl 1:  No, you’re immoral! Girl 2:  Oh my God! You’re sick!  Magpatingin ka sa psychiatrist! (Go see a psychiatrist!) Girl 1:  Ikaw ang magpatingin!  (You should go see one!) Girl 2:  I didn’t do anything wrong or immoral.  Look at you, you don’t have friends.    By this time, I couldn’t take it anymore so I blurted out loudly,  “Oh my God, I cannot believe I am hearing this!”   The woman standing next to me nodded.  I thought that would actually make them stop.  But, no!  They continued to argue and go more and more personal.  I heaved a sigh of relief when my friend was finally done.  We went out laughing and the two weird girls still at who, between them, was really immoral and who should be seeking professional help.  Honestly, I think they both need help… fast!  While listening to the two girls arguing, I came to realize that in this life no one has the right to judge another person, especially another person’s faith.  When Girl 1 said, “There’s something wrong with your Christianity,” I just couldn’t help but laugh (and I did laugh with them watching me).  I found that funny because the conversation they were having was really weird and Girl 1’s bringing up Girl 2’s Christianity was just too much and misplaced.  And, that was when Girl 2 really exploded.  If I were in that situation and someone told me something was wrong with my being a Muslim or my Islamic view, no, I wouldn’t explode like Girl 2.  I would approach the person and speak really close to his/her face and very calmly say,  "Prove to me that there’s nothing wrong with yours!  After you’ve done that, then tell me this again.  But, right now, let me ask you this.  Who are you to say there is something wrong with my faith?!"     We, people, are all very good at judging and questioning other people, but honestly how often do we really judge and question our own selves?  I don’t think we do that a lot.  Hearing those girls made me resolve that it would be better to stop and check myself first before I go on to notice other people.  That way, I’ll be in a better state.  I’ll be at peace with myself and with others.   Assalaamu alaikum.  (Peace be with you.)

        I lost my cellular phone the other night.  It took me some time to see the brighter side of this.  Hmm, oh well…  Let me start by talking about that day (Tuesday).  It was a good day and I was really excited because I was to catch “ Happy Together ” at the  UP Film Center .  I mean, after all those years of waiting for a chance to see the movie and looking for a copy of it in vain, I was pretty much psyched up about the thought of finally seeing it.  And, especially after my very good friend,  Bok , lent me a copy of it, but every stupid PC at the dorm just wouldn’t read the damned DVD.  I was just so happy when she informed me that it was going to be shown at the FC.  So naturally, I was bubbling with excitement the whole day.  And, after waiting for what seemed like centuries, it was finally six o’clock and I was standing in line.  The movie was absolutely great.  I’ve never seen anything as brave and as “gay” as that movie.  What I loved about it is that even if I’m straight and all, I didn’t feel excluded in whatever way while watching the movie.  I cried a number of times.  By showing the ups and downs of the two main characters’ relationship, the movie made me see the ups and downs that people, whether gay or straight, go through.  And, the loneliness of the characters really got to me.  The movie showed me truths about life much more than most movies I’ve seen ever did and affected me… much, much more than I ever thought it would.  I say it’s definitely  Wong Kar-Wai ’s best!  I’ve always loved  Tony Leung Chiu Wai , but in this movie, he really outdid himself!  I totally loved the movie!:)  Okay, so after the movie, I went to grab a bite at  Philcoa  and eventually decided to stay a little longer so I could check my email and read whatever’s new with my blog friends.  But, I couldn’t really concentrate since my mind was still in “ Happy Together ” mode, meaning I couldn’t think of anything other than the movie.  Just before I left the Net Café, I checked my cellular phone in case my friends texted me.  No message received.  I never thought that would be the last time I’d see my phone.  After that, I went to the terminal and took the jeepney.  As we approached  UP Campus , I noticed that my bag was opened halfway.  Not giving it a thought at all, I just closed it.  As soon as I got to my room, I opened my bag to get my phone.  I was so shocked to find it wasn’t there.  I looked for it in the pockets.  Not there either.  Then, the idea sank in.  Somebody took it; that was why my bag was open!  I was in deep “ Happy Together ” thought that I didn’t even notice my bag being opened and my poor phone, my companion for two years, being stolen!:(  I was in total shock for a while.  I wanted to shout; I wanted to cry.  I wanted to tell my friends, but how could I?  I couldn’t text them, I just lost my phone!  Then, I calmed myself down and kept telling myself, “Happy thoughts, happy thoughts! Come on, happy thoughts…”  And, after a little more self-pitying, I finally got over it.  I thought it was a good thing, after all, that whoever took my phone didn't take anything but the phone.  I mean, imagine if s/he took my wallet as well.  God, that would have made me really cry or want to kill somebody!  Having lost my phone would mean “freedom”.  I won’t have to text some people my whereabouts all the time.  I won’t need to explain why I didn’t text back or why I couldn’t go and meet up since there’s no way I’d have known that they texted.  Believe it or not, these things were enough to make me smile.  Oh, and, besides, I can still buy a new phone… yeah, after I’ve saved enough.  Or maybe my folks could get me a new one.  Hehehe!:)  Now, how’s that for a brighter side?;P

        August is a month that brings lots of memories to me, both good and bad.  It’s during this month that I would always introspect and reflect about things that have happened in my life and be thankful for everything despite and inspite of some bad things.    August 2000: The Birth of Tanglaw    I was fresh from college graduation when I found out that I was part of the Philippine delegation to the  27th Ship for SouthEast Asian Youth Program (SSEAYP) .  It was August 2000.  The  National Youth Commission  informed me through mail that after the interview (a few moths before), essay writing and screening my credentials, I was one of the finalists.  The letter of confirmation came on the 5th day of the month.  It said that I had to be in Manila for the Orientation and the Medical, Physical and Psychological Examinations by the 14th of the month.  It also said that to be submitted on the 14th (the Orientation Day) were my passport, police and barangay clearances, and birth certificate.  At the time I received the communication, I didn’t have a passport.  So, that gave me nine days to accomplish everything.  The police and barangay clearances were no problem at all since I don’t have any criminal record whatsoever.  My mom always had a copy of my birth certificate, so it was ready in no time.  But, the passport?  We needed to go to  Cagayan de Oro , a good two-hour land travel (minus traffic), to get a passport.  It was a good thing that there weren’t a lot of people in line to get passports (not like in Manila).  It also helped, of course, that the Director of the Regional Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs is a good friend of my parents'. (Yeah, I will not deny that!)  I got my passport less than a week after we went to apply for one.  Then, I was off to Manila!  I met my  SSEAYP  batch mates-to-be on the 14th.  It was great because as soon as some of us got to talking, it felt like we knew one another our whole lives.  We were all together the next two days for the medical and physical examinations and the psychological examination, which gave me a really bad headache and which took us a whole day to finish.  And, on the 19th, we found ourselves on a bus and on our way to  Tagaytay  for our  Pre-Departure Training .  Those ten days of training were some of my most unforgettable days.  Those were days of great camaraderie, laughter, pride, happiness, sadness, even fear and nervousness… everything!  After the  PDT , we all realized that we’d experienced and found great friendship and family outside of our own families back home.  The month closed with all of us ecstatic beyond belief.  We were confirmed as “delegates” on the 30th.  That was one of my proudest and happiest moments.  August would always bring me back to those days.:)    ***********************    August 2001: Tanglaw's Rizza Simon   Exactly a year after that, we were all still “drunk” from our  SSEAYP  days.  Our heads were still full of  SSEAYP  memories so fresh that sometimes it felt like we were all still there.  We were all back to our respective hometowns and provinces, but we could still hear the bell that called us to meals and the very Japanese “ this is an announcement from the administration… ” that boomed all over the  Nippon Maru  (our ship), we could still smell and taste all the seafood, the ice cream, the different kinds of rice (Japanese rice, ordinary rice, fried rice, etc.), the eggs (cooked/prepared in every way you could imagine), the  Haagen Dazs  ice cream from the vending machine, etc, etc, etc.  (Aaah, I could just imagine all these things as if I were still there right now.)  That August in 2001, we were all so excited and sad at the same time because it was our turn to sit as part of the panel of interviewers for the screening of applicants for the next batch.  Ever since we came back from the program, every single activity that had something to do with  SSEAYP  stirred an inexplicable excitement and happiness within each one of us and we were sad because with the excitement of interviewing new applicants came the realization that we were no longer THE  participating youths (PYs) , we were  ex-PYs .  The interview for  Region 12  (the region I represented) was held in  Cotabato City .  I went there accompanied by my mom, the driver and a guy friend of mine.  It was the 18th.  Only one day was needed for all the  Region 12  applicants to be interviewed.  So, naturally, we decided to leave for home the very next day.  While we were packing our things, I received a text from  Randy , one of my batch mates.  It said “ Kawawa naman si Rizza, ‘no? Namatay! ” (Poor  Rizza , right?  She’s dead!)  Yes, it was that blunt.  I will never forget those words.  I was so shocked it felt like hours passed before I could move.  I couldn’t breathe.    As soon as I could function normally, i.e. think straight and breathe normally, I texted  Randy .  I demanded for him to apologize for such a bad and cruel joke, but he never replied.  I immediately called  Popsie  (our  National Leader ) and asked him if it was true.  He confirmed it and asked me how I found out.  Apparently, he asked my batch mates not to tell me yet for fear I might have a heart attack and follow  Rizza  to death!  I didn’t know what to say or what to do.  I felt numb!    For a while, I couldn’t move.  I stood glued to the window, but I didn’t see anything.  I felt like I was left hanging without any emotion or feeling.  And then, all of a sudden, I burst to tears.  And then I was hysterical. I told my mom and my guy friend what happened.  They didn’t know what to say to me.  They just looked at each other.   I cried and cried.  I called   urlLink  Tita Pie    (another batch mate).  She was crying, too.  We cried and cried.   Rizza ’s death is another thing that would always make August special to me.  This month would always make my memories of  Rizza  so alive that it feels like she’s still here with us.   Rizza  was a hero.  She died in the line of duty.  She was the very  first female helicopter pilot of the Philippine Air Force .  She was one of the pilots of the helicopter that was sent to rescue a certain vice governor’s mother and some other people whose plane crashed somewhere in the North.  They went out in the dead of the night.  They could’ve waited for sunlight, but no, they went!  Maybe  Mr. Death  called for them to come to him.  The rescue team found the people they went to search for, but sadly they were already dead.  The bodies were put in the helicopter so that it became too heavy for the helicopter to carry the weight and so they crashed!  That was how we lost our dear  Rizza .  She was only 28.   Rizza  was one of the most beautiful (literally and figuratively) women I’ve ever met.  She was tall, graceful, and confident and she had such a nice smile.  She was never afraid to say what was on her mind.  She was the type of person who automatically commanded respect to those around her.  She was a feminist.  She didn’t like guys staring at (make that drooling over) women’s body parts.  She was very nice, very reasonable and considerate.  She had such discipline that I have never ever seen anybody possess.  She was very intelligent (she was, after all, the  NCR  representative).  She was talented, but it didn’t matter to her if she had to take the backseat or if she was just an “extra” in the presentations, dances, songs and all numbers that we had to present.  She was always cooperative; she never complained.  She was willing to eat ripe mangoes using nothing but her hands and share them with a friend – me!  We would go for the last piece of shrimp tempura and giggle nonstop after.  Back in the ship, she would call us in our rooms to remind us what to wear (we had uniforms).  When she had to refuse something, she expressed it in such a way that you never feel hurt or rejected.  She,  Charo (my SSEAYP best friend)  and I always hung out with each other during formations and laughed at the silliest things.  She was a sister to us.   I always looked up to her.  She was a model to us, to me especially.  She will always be.        Rizza ’s death showed and made me (us) realize how short life is.  The time that we’re all together should always be enjoyed and made the most out of because we’ll never know when we’re going to be together again or if we would ever be complete or if we would all be together again.   Rizza  told some of us that on our wedding days, she’d be willing to fly to our places and drop confetti from her helicopter for us.  It was such an exciting idea.  And, I’m sure that on my wedding day she’d be throwing the promised confetti… maybe not from her helicopter, but from heaven. “ Live life to the fullest! ” was what she’d always write on the notebooks or delegation booklets that were passed for people to sign.  And, she sure did live her life to the fullest.    Thank you,  Rizza ...  thank you for the memories, the friendship, the beauty you shared.  Thank you for the lessons you made us learn.    Thank you, dear Pilot Rizza   (that’s what I called her),   for everything.  :)
