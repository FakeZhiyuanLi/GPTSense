      I love spring! I love spring! I love spring!!!  It'll be nearly seventy here today.  I bought flipflops and nail polish this weekend and did my toes on Sunday!!   They're PINK!   The downside to being single and not manhunting:  Sometimes you forget to do those little chicky things just 'cause.   Okay Okay...still waiting to hear back from ever-elusive agent # 4.  Sending out  another  partial to an  agent  today.

       Wow what an incredible year.    It's been about that long since I decided to "put up or shut up" and I guess I've put up rather well.  It was a year ago this month I started working on TCRA.  I finished in August, quit smoking and got a new tattoo.  Wonder what I'll do for my 35th birthday? =) I've spent 33 years just kind of wandering through life, trying to figure myself out, my place in the world, what I'm supposed to do.  I'm a quitter by nature.  I'd rather not try than fail, but not this time ;-).   I think I've truly amazed myself.  Every time I sit down to write it gets easier.  It's still hard to create but that 400 pages doesnt seem quite so daunting anymore.  I know I can do it, I've done it three times. And learned the true meaning of discpline and hard work--took long enough, huh?   In the last year I've completed three manuscripts, a novella, and have three other manuscripts in different stages of developement.  I told a friend of mine it's like the lights came on and everyone's home.  I've made some of the most wonderful friends through writing and I have the greatest crit parters =).    I've learned writers are just neurotic, so get over it.  We all question ourselves, and our abilities and writing is highly personal--even if it is fiction it's still  our  creation.  It's okay to break what other people call "the rules" and the only rules and limits that truly exist are the ones we impose on ourselves.    A dream is  a scary thing but I know, even if I fail, it won't be because I didn't try.  It won't be because I quit.  Quitters never win.  Winners never quit.   I am very fucking determiend.

      OMFG.  Okay I'm going to swear.  Yes I swear.  I admit it.  And now I'm going to swear.  Cover your eyes and scroll on by if you don't want to read it.  I bought a brand new car in February--which is no big deal if you've owned brand new cars before but this is my first.  It had 5 freaking miles when I got in.  It's a Saturn.  I love my Saturn =)  A few weeks ago my son (8YO) took a Dr. Pepper to daycare.  Somehow the can got a hole in it.  Yup by the time we got there I had fucking DR Kill Your Kid all over the back of my brand new, didnt even have 2000 miles on it car.  Bless his heart a few days later my brother shows up.  He takes my carpet cleaner and shampoos out my back seat and the stain comes right up.  And it was good.  And mom was happy.  Yesterday I had a fight with my son (10YO).  I made him carry the groceries in and I KNOW I SHUT MY MOFO CAR DOOR!!!!   I went out this morning and my driver's side car door was standing open.  Now, since little shit carried in the groceries, I didn't trip the locks last night.  Great =(  I KNOW I SHUT MY MOFO CAR DOOR!!!  My door was open all night long.  I'm lucky I even still have a car and that no one messed with it.  By one I mean humans.    My son goes "Mom the car smells like cat pee."  My brand new, less than 3000 miles car smells like fucking cat piss.    So there we are in the Starbucks drivethrough this morning sniffing my seats and each other.  There is a spot on the back of the back seat the size of a CD where some MOTHER FUCKING CAT SPRAYED!!!!

      My youngest son is a natural born ham (he's 8 and my oldest is 10.  They're both mixed--1/4 black and you have to know this to understand the humor, I think.  I'd love to see the expression on their Dad's face when my 8 YO starts singing James Brown --what's that song--- say it!  say it loud! I'm black and I'm proud!!!!!   My ex tends to ignore the fact his ex-wife is mixed, but the kids know we are, it's a fact, we dont dwell on it...blah blah blah  Okay so about 2 weeks ago we're making sandwiches and my 8YO son says, "Black people dont eat mayonaise and i'm not touching it."   Then my other son (10) pipes up, "I'm blacker than you."  "No you're not"  "Yes I am cause I'm older"   To which  I replied, "I eat it and I'm blacker than both of you." --obviously if they're 1/4 I'm 1/2.    But I'm laughing my ass off thinking, "Where the HELL did this child come up with this? And I can't believe my kids are arguing over who is blacker?!"  THe next day  "Undercover Brother"   comes on and the kids are watching it.  I'm cleaning up and listening la la la la l alaa they're trying to turn UCB into a white man and they make him eat mayonaise against his very vocal protests.  At which point he informs them only white people eat mayonaise and I start laughing and look at my youngest son and he goes "See I told you so!!!!!"  So anyway I listen to the rest of the movie w/half an ear.  To more mayonaise stuff and at the end they have James Brown who of course sings (Gawd I dont even know the song's real name) but it was the I'm black and i'm proud song.  So now Donald runs around doing his best James Brown immitation.  Wonder what the sperm donor will say to that.  Not that I give a shit.

      Spiderman review.    No spoilers. Definitely not for small kids.  My 8yo loved it though.  It's  much  darker than the first one.  As an adult I appreciated that--or maybe as a writer.  The special effects in some of the fight scenes are  a-mazing but it's not a special effects fest.  There's definitly a story there.  The woman in me was satisfied with the ending and I think we can safely expect a Spideyman 3.   "There's a hero in all of us."   Aunt Mae said that or something really close to it.  And a whole lot more about how we needed hero's and stuff.  I was so entranced I can't remember her exact words.    The writer in me was just fascinated at Spiderman's conflict(s) and how he handled them.  Either I"m a total freak or there were some really deep things I needed to hear that I picked up on in that movie.  About believing in yourself and stuff like that.    Phenomenal.   Go see it.

      Wow! It's been an incredible week.  Still waiting on Agent 1 with the full and have a few more that want to see partials.  But Agent 1 wanted an exclusive through the weekend.  I ain't saying no  .  I think choosing an agent's got to be harder than choosing a man.  Wait...damn...I sure hope I'm better at choosing an agent than choosing a man.  It's...um...been a really scary and very humbling week and it's only Wednesday.  And kinda overwhelming.  I'm not one to brag or gloat--okay maybe just a bit and only to my ex-husband (see my post about revenge).  I'm very grateful for everything including the support of my writer budettes who have held my hands this week and my children who love frozen pizzas.    The one thing I learned from my ex was  "Don't get your hopes to high becuase I promise I"ll disappoint you."   And he always did.  I'm trying real hard not to get my hopes too high--the higher they are the more it hurts when you get let down.    Oh yeah, happy Spiderman day.

      When I was young and dumb...and weren't we all...I did stupid things to get back at people.  Funny, they always failed!  Now of course I know better.  The best revenge, the ultimate revenge is to live well.  You don't have to be filthy rich or have lots of toys or be the best Christian (which is a whole 'nother blog entry).    Just live well.    Be happy! Follow your dreams.  It's not like you're wasting time. Or are you? Do stuff!  Smile!  Get Tattoos!    I will freely admit there is a side of me who has a list of people as long as my arm I'd like to thumb my nose at.  Turning my back and moving forward is SO HARD but it's so worth it.    My ex works a menial job and is supported by his wife.  I support me and two kids with no man.  No one supports me and it eats his ASS to see me doing well, not only with HIM but alone (and yes being alone has its downfalls but that's another post too LOL).

      I feel so OLD!  My oldest friend in the world (I've known her since I was -gulp- nine) turns 35 today.  And I'm next =(  Turning 29 hurt--28 was a rough year and 29 was the last year I'd be 20-something  . Turning 30 was a snap--no biggie. At 32 I quit coloring my hair and let the divorce-induced greys shine through.  Turning 35 deserves something special--like a new tattoo.

      Well yesterday I got the big "R" from Agent 1.  It was a very nice "R", a good "R" as  "R's" go but they hurt.  You can't take them personal.  That's life and it's just a part of the business.  As much as I'm disappointed, I'll keep moving forward.   I already mailed out the other requested partials and fulls so now we just wait....I don't see any birthday tattoos in my future.

      As writers we must be very proactive on our road to publication but it sure is hard sometimes.  Esp. when you're shy.  (Quit laughing, Mr. Pinky)  Still no word from Agent 1.  Partials for others are ready to go.  May give her an email nudge after I get my hair cut.    Being proactive means grabbing the bull by the balls but that can be kinda tricky.    I talk to editors and stuff all the time for my job but calling for MYSELF is a whole 'nother matter.  The one time I called an editor to check on the status of my submission I nearly hyperventilated.  I get so nervous I choke and i can't talk.    A really wonderful writer friend told me something along the lines of "I'm hiring the agent not the other way around."    But it sure does FEEL the other way around.  I'm such a wuss. --- Oh we moved to a new server so look for webpage udpates and a new blog as soon as I figure out how to make it all happen.  Writing?  What writing?

      What writers are like?  Well take a look at today's hilari-scope....   Your attitude towards others pushes you to meet people, who could be considered by a large majority, as eccentric persons. They might be considered by a large majority to be a little bit strange. You will be happy to meet one of them today, but this person will look familiar and strangely enough, will most likely be yourself.

      I really REALLY hate bitchy shallow people.&nbsp; Why do people feel the need to walk around (figuratively speaking) acting like their shit don't stink?&nbsp; Like they're superior for ANY reason or worse yet, like what they write makes them better than you or gives them the right to look down on you?&nbsp; And why do they go out of their way to TRY and make people feel shitty?  &nbsp;  Becuase they're insecure and need therapy?&nbsp; Becuase they're sheep who wouldn't know "coloring outside the lines" if they failed Kindegarten?&nbsp;  -  I got news for 'em.&nbsp; They're wrong.&nbsp; They're no different than any other hardworking stiff on this big planet and talking shit only makes them look like crap.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hate to sound like a cliche but actions truly do speak louder than words.  &nbsp;  I AM SO NOT IMPRESSED.......  &nbsp;  Don't ever apologize for what you write ......

      I am SO TIRED.&nbsp; I don't think I've falled asleep before midnight one night this week.&nbsp; Last night I stayed up watching CMT's Crossroads with Heart and the Wynonna.&nbsp; It got me to thinking.&nbsp; I LOVE Crossroads BTW.&nbsp; I'm so not musically or poetically inclined but I love music and have such a soft spot for singer/songwriters---from Michelle Branch to Chris Cagle to Stevie Nicks to Sheryl Crow (who is just IT IMO).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's not to say I don't like singers or musicians.&nbsp; I think as a creative person I admire what allows or lets others create.&nbsp; I was watching Crossroads and they were talking about how videos have taken the soul out of music--you can't feel it anymore--for the most part I agree.&nbsp; But that made me think about Tim Mc Graw's new video for&nbsp; "Live Like You Were Dying" -- he's singing against a white background and dressed in white.&nbsp; It's so simplistic you can't help but FEEL the song, which is absolutely incredible.&nbsp; Yes, I cry at music videos and for songs.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I listen to some and I wonder what sparked an idea, where they came up with the concept for this or that--in Sheryl Crow's case what was her Favorite Mistake or with Chris Cagle what was it about Laredo that sparked the idea for a song.&nbsp; Is Chicks Dig It really just about chicks?&nbsp; Or is it a theme to live by?&nbsp; Alan&nbsp; Jackson's "Remember When" or&nbsp;"Drive" that makes me laugh and think of my own dad teaching me to drive--in of all things a Mercury (Ie "Crazy 'Bout a Mercury"?) &nbsp;  I immagine songwriting is a lot like manuscript writing and that each, in their own way, is very difficult.&nbsp; I get 100k words to tell a story but a songwriter gets much MUCH less to tell a story, convey a though, or express a feeling.   This isn't near as good as it was last night when I composed it in my head, but oh well.&nbsp; Maybe i'll edit later.&nbsp;

      Well I have to say yesterday was one of the most nerve-wracking, stomach-twisting days of my life.  Definitely par for the course for me.  This is going to be long--probaby.  Which is no surprise if you know me *g*  Monday La Agenta (the agent?) calls.  Caller ID is for those who love to inflict self abuse.  She leaves no message but I know she called because of CALLER ID...ARGGGGGG So I call back and leave a message.  I'm home in the morning until 8:30 CST.  I hang around Tuesday morning and ... no call. Go to work and of course CHECK THE CALLER ID.  Don't do this.  Don't EVER do this.    La Agenta has left a message w/her cell # so I can call her back.  But I can't call from work and my cell phone is broke so i can't even step outside for five and besides what if I scream or something--this is a BIG no no.  I get to sit at work for SIX HOURS WAITING to GO HOME and CALL HER BACK!!!!  So I skip out 15 minutes early, FORGETTING I needed to get gas.  Sooooo I have to stop for gas. THENNNNNN I have to stop and mail my revised TARA entry so it arrives in time. FINALLY I get to the daycare to pick up the kids who INSIST On kicking ONE MORE FREAKING BALL (they're playing kickball).  I RUN THROUGH WENDY's for dinner so I dont have to cook, grab my dinner and beeline for the bedroom to call her.  By some miracle my kids decided NOT to bug me while I was on the phoen with her.*thank you*    OBVIOUSLY if she's giving me her cell # she's not going to reject me but I still had to hear it for real with mine own two ears becuase it's just not real.  But it is, she loved  urlLink "The Big Girl's Guide to Buying Lingerie"  and wants to be my agent.    I got off the phone and immediately called  urlLink Pam Britton  who is probably one of the nicest pubbed writers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I called a couple more friends, posted on eHarl, posted on my crit loop, told the chicks in chicklit chat and generally just sat around wired for sound.    But why am I not more excited.  I'm totally psyched about WHO My agent is, so I know that's not it.  I'm overwhlemed, I'm tired and last but most certainly not least I'm releived.    As writers we tend to second guess ourselves, we compare ourselves TO ourselves (how crazy is THAT?) not to mention other writers and we can't, we shouldn't, we know better but we do it anyway.    Having an agent fills me with relief--I feel validated as a writer.  I mean people can tell you it's good all day long but when an agent wants you that's different.  It's like the difference between your mom saying you're cute and the man of your dreams saying you're cute (or gorgeous or whatever).   I know I still have to produce saleable work but I don't have to worry about doing the selling.  I NEED to learn about contracts (and all that entails eventuallY) but to be frank, I'm one of those writers who just wants to write.

You will alter your behavior and you will feel very strongly about the following thing: You are a Lion and you need to feel free. You are no longer willing to let someone rule your life.

      If you haven't checked out  urlLink  Gretchen Wilson , consider it.  Especially if you're tired of bubble gum country.  I spent the morning tweaking my article for my chapter's newsletter.  I made myself do this.  I think it's important, as a writer, to explore other avenues of expression--something I'm personally bad at.  I'll probably add a link off the "Stuff" page later on and post it.   I also updated the "Stuff" page and you've got a new hunk to ogle.  Not to mention Maggie's meatloaf recipe.  Maggie is, of course, Ty, Zack, Zander and Tim's mother.  Considering posting the Boudreaux and friends family tree but I'm afraid that would only confuse things more.  Ty, Zack and Tim all have a story, 1/2 sister Delaney is backstory in all three and a major player in Zander's story--which has a conflict I cannot solve (yet).  All four boys end up with long term significant others.  Some day Delaney will marry.  Ty's wife has a grown sister.  I expect Charlene to return to Bluebonnet someday.  Does a felonious ex-con deserve a happy ending?  What about Potty-Mouth Rene?  Will she ever stop cussing?  Stay tuned.  And then of course we have Susie Boudreax, owner of the dancehall, aunt extraordinaire to all four boys and a Merry Widow ;-) who becomes John Kane's lover.   urlLink Jessa Stratton  has 2 single brothers, and then a sister that married young.  I've already got an idea for one brother's story that takes surprise fatherhood to a new level (insert evil laugh here).   urlLink Jade Ballard  has 1 sister and one brother.  I'm already perking over plans to do sister Emerald's story this winter. Someday soon Tricky Nicky will get his own story too, though right now I'm planning a novella.    why am I writing all this?  I have no clue.

      Okay, I know with manuscripts like children, we really shouldn't play favorites but....I must confess I do.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I love them all individually, they are all special in their own....blah blah blah.   But one particular manuscript has always been my fave.&nbsp; So I confess it's a book of the heart, sue me.&nbsp; It practically wrote itself.&nbsp; It's occasionally done well in contests but more often than not gotten TRASHED with comments like "your heroine seems kinda slutty."&nbsp; "your hero's sort of a wimp. there's nothing appealing about a broken beta male."&nbsp; And saddest of all, "This is NOT a romance."&nbsp; I love this story.&nbsp; I love these characters but honestly thought they were hopeless.&nbsp; A lost cause.   Yes, ladies (and lurkers) I'm talking about  urlLink Cowboys Don't Cry , which just became a LCRW Jasmine Finalist!!!!

You handle everything yourself.  You are one person who has everything well in hand!    urlLink   What Atypical Noun Best Fits You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     No comment

      Well I got a better blog up but it meant losing all my old posts, so I'm still debating :-(  Right now I'm reading  urlLink Mistress of Trevelyan , a sort of gothic style historical by Jennifer St. Giles.  I got waylayed at her table at the RWA Booksigning.  The book did sound good and she was so nice I bought it.  To my very delighted surprise, not only is it good, it's written in first person!  This is Jennifer's first published book, apparently and won the very prestigious  urlLink KOD  Daphne Award.  Off to shop for school supplies and see a movie.  It's been such a hectic couple of weeks I think we deserve a break today.  Two weeks till school starts!

      sorry folks I'm seriously slacking on the blogging.  didn't have much to say, it's been a long harrowing week and I dont even want to go look at my bank balance.    instead lets talk about forwarding email **raises eyebrows**.  Be kind to your friends and family learn to clean up email before you forward it and for CRYING OUT LOUD learn to blind carbon copy!!!! **frown**  Oh yeah and  urlLink use SNOPES  to investigate any "warnings" like the WTC virus which I got today.  I can't tell you how much getting that crap irritates me ESPECIALLY when people dont clean or bcc their email (and send it to their WHOLE address book) let alone check out hoaxes no matter how many times they're asked!!!!  I really don't want God and everyone having my email address and I can't bitch enough about it.  It ranks right up there with SPAM!!!  Writing?  What writing? I haven't written a lick all week.

      So we're leaving the optometrist, where I've threatened my children to behave (and get Whataburger) or not (and get PBJ's).    We're driving across the highway to  urlLink Whataburger   and my son says, "Mom, what's Viagra?"   Huh?   "Um, it's for old men who can't get their penis erect to have sex."  "Ewwwww, that's gross."  "Yeah, it sure is."   Old People Sex, ewwwwwwwww   I asked him, he saw it on a sign as we were getting ready to cross the highway.  That's as bad as Cialis commericials while we're trying to watch Law & Order.     Sadder yet, Insurance companies will pay for Viagra but not birth control pills. Any day now I expect to hear there's been a rise in "old" fathers. *frown*

      I have PMS, three contest entries I MUST judge this week, a possible busted blood vessel in my leg (going to dr tomorrow), a house to clean before the freaking babysitter comes tomorrow, so she doesn't think I'm a total freak, PMS (need I say more?), meeting plans Wed. afternoon which I'm sort of dreading, then Thursday night w/the agent, and a parental (mine) I could barely get to babysit for me (but he wants the first published copy of my book? I don't fuckin' think so). School starts in three weeks--the good news is I can stop paying daycare the bad news is I haven't even started shopping for school clothes, supplies, shoes (shoes alone will run around 80 bucks =() And, drumroll please, I have a pin-sized hole in my last contact.  Trust me, my script is so odd, even if I COULD afford to go the eye doctor, it'd take days to get new contacts (or glasses) in.  Glasses?  Yeah, you could call them that but they're in terrible shape.     Did I mention I had PMS?   One more hour to whine..I mean wine.

      Well the little angles came home yesterday.  I had 2 whole hours of peace and quiet before i had to yell at them.    Otherwise its just quiet.  I have nothing new to report.  Somehow I get the impression this isn't a bad thing.  In other news  urlLink Travis Tritt  looks like he had botox injections! WTF is that?

      On Sylvia Day's and Alison Kent's Blogs we've commented on how some writes read outside their genre.    So, whether you write or not, what are you reading?  What's going to be released soon that's got you excited?  Who do you autobuy?  I'm still working on Mistress but have Alison's Shaughnessey Accord sitting in my TBR Pile, along with Katie MacAlister's Corest Diaries and a slew of others.    Kay Hooper's  urlLink Hunting Fear  comes out in just over a week (she's an autobuy).  And is supposed to be the continuation of her Psychic FBI Series.  Mary Kay Andrews'  urlLink Hissy Fit  comes out the same day.  I can only hope it's as good as Little Bitty Lies was.

      Since Betti Boudreaux's Rules appear in two stories (CDC & TBGG) I thought it might be kinda fun to post some of them here. There are 16 all total.  1.  Don’t Ever Sleep With A Boy From Bluebonnet. (Technically you can ignore this since it's a fictional town ;-)) 2.  Be Discreet. 3.  Keep it Light. 4.  Have Fun. 5.  Women In Love Do Stupid Things. (It's a given.  Live with it) 6.  Be Prepared.  (For anything including, to quote my friend Jaq, hot monkey sex)  Caveat: Betti says if you find yourself breaking the majority of these for some man, marry him.

      I realized soemthing this weekend.  Just how important, how VITAL good solid characterization is in writing.    I finished judging contest entries this weekend then went and critted 2 chapters for an unpublished friend.  The difference was amazing. A cool drink of water after a long, hot walk.  Is creating well-rounded, multi-dimensional characters that hard?  Gonna think about this some....

      The Sun and Mars continue to bring you confidence and courage, AMIE. You feel on top of the world, and the world can't help but notice. But make sure that you don't do anything too rash when it comes to your finances. The Moon opposes Mercury and conjuncts Uranus, which might encourage you to make a purchase that you can't truly afford. So don't give in to impulse buying. Take it easy.    Does school shopping count?   Friday is yet another time when you will want to keep a check on reality, especially in the sphere of your intimate relationships or permanent partnerships. The Sun opposes Neptune, so those you are involved with may prove even more perplexing than ever, and it is possible that you could misinterpret their actions. Don't fly off the handle, or do anything you could regret.    Friday: Taking kids shoe shopping for school shoes.  I'm seeing a pattern here.   On Saturday Venus moves into Cancer, which means that things are going to go quiet for a little while. If you find that your communications with others seem to tail off, then don't worry, as it is only a temporary measure.    Paid Phone Bill: Check

       urlLink The Evolution of Chick Lit   Interesting.  And on a topic that often starts heated debates.  Is it chick lit?  What is chick lit?  Can you do this?  Can you do that?  If there are no rules in chicklit, then why can't I do that?   You said there were no rules!!!!!!  Why does everything have to be classified and sub-genre'd?  And how does CL fit into romance writing--or not?  I get the feeling that not all romance writers are thrilled at the upstart, pink bitch that is chick lit.  Can I say that on here?  Guess so.  What's the difference between chick lit and so-called women's fiction?  Ask the contest judge who didnt like the fact one of my heroines has a tattoo and swears.    I recently heard a writer call chick lit "sex and men" then go on to wonder how you write CHRISTIAN chick lit.  It was rather tactless, I thought, on many levels.  If you're curious, check out Kristen Billerbeck.  I can't find her website.  Oxymoronically enough (no that's NOT a word--leastways I don't think so), as a genre chicklit seems to be notorious for "closing the bedroom door."  Someone forgot to CC me on that memo.  Interesting.    My thought is that chick lit, like any other creature on this planet must evolve to survive.  And I think it is.  To the detriment of those who would see it die.  People resist change but what they don't realize is change is fundamental to life.  Change IS life (and if you save enough of it, you can put it in the Coinstar machine and get money out).     Makes me wonder if historical have these sorts of debates...  So what do I write?   I have no freakin' clue.

      taking your children shoe shopping.  My oldest wears Men's size 8 (he's 10).  My youngest is in kid's shoes.  It was just so NOT funny.  I mean really.  We do this three times a year and frankly, I'd rather get my teeth cleaned with sandpaper =(

      What happened?  I have no idea what happened to the blog or why it's all screwed up like it is. Maybe Blogger has gas.   When I was in jr. high I had the biggest crush on this guy...my best friend reminded me of how I used to make up stories about him *snort*. His name was...maybe I shouldn't mention names...ah what the hell. Lynn Henley. I know I'm such a dork. Hell, he probably still lives at home with his parents =)  And then, in high school, I had the hots for our drum major (a born again Christian no less). I used to rip pads off my clarinet just so he'd fix em for me. I was such a loser -- "L"  And then there was my first boyfriend, son of the town mortician (even at an early age I was making bad man choices). He used me to make another friend jealous (eventhough she had no boyfriend). I have no idea what's he's doing these days but I heartell she's strung out on speed. She's the only drug adict I ever knew who GAINED weight.  I was a serious band geek.

      Carrot Cake (w/cream cheese icing) can I eat before I fall into a sugar coma?  Homemade from scratch.  My step mother makes EVERYONE a birthday/anniversary cake and decorates it.  I already have the shakes so I better type fast =)  I was GOING to post some antecdotes about my childhood today but since I was a perfect angel I guess I can skip that, huh?  Okay okay I thought of one.  When I was seventeen my best friend let me cut her hair.  Now, before you freak out I did have a license.  =)  I was also drunk. =( Surprisingly she still speaks to me.  ;-)  Do you ever think about milestone birthdays?  What exactally IS a milestone birthday? 29 was definitely a milestone.  I bawled.  Probably becuase 28 was such a tough year--my divorce was FINALLY finalized and I'd found and been rejected by my birth mom, I dropped out of college, had to move AGAIN, and nothing says single motherhood like foodstamps =( I turned 29 and thought,  "this is all there is?  I am a total fuckup!"   Fourteen months ago I started my first ms.  I wonder if, on some subconscious level, I realized that, you know, hey 35 is coming.   35 is coming.  Don't you think it's time to plan for a future for your kids?  What have you done with your life?  Don't you think it's time you decided what you wanted to DO with the rest of your life?    34 was pretty busy, but you know, sitting here at 35 I can honestly say for the first time ever I'm proud of myself.  And I'm out of cake ;-)

       Writing may be one of your main focuses for today, AMIE. You have a lot of information to impart to anyone who might be interested in what you have to say. You could try your hand at a magazine article, or perhaps fiction, or poetry. However, even if all you write at this time is a letter to your grandmother, what you say will undoubtedly be bright, gripping, and certainly very interesting. Go to it!   This is todays.  It really made me laugh cause I spent all weekend reworking the beginning of TCRA (yes, again).  On Friday I talked with a friend who'd read the first four chapters and she said, "Can I be honest."  She always is.   "Of course." "It has no spark.  It doesn't suck me in.  Even the first version sucked me in.  I'm sorry." No, let me bow down and kiss your feet.  What did I learn?  LISTEN to your instincts becuase they're always right.  I KNEW those chapters weren't anywhere near as good as they could be.  I KNEW there was something wrong.  But I tried to ignore it and keep plowing forward.  Well, her and I brainstormed Friday and I spent the weekend reworking chapters 2-4.    Earlier last week I told another friend that Zack bored me (Zack and Jessa both have a tendancy to play it really close to the vest which makes my job that much harder).  Obviously that's not a good thing.  If he bores me, he'd definitely bore a reader!  So we threw ideas back and forth and it got me to thinking more about him.    He's perfect.  In the real world we'd probably call him gay but that dog won't hunt.  So of course I spent a long time thinking about Laid Back Zack and what made him tick.  It's not easy being an artist in a prominent ranching family in a small town.  Or a single dad with no mother for your child in sight(and no explanation as to her whereabouts).  We can definitely concede he's not an alpha, probably not even a gamma but a bona fide beta male.  His view of the world small and large makes him feel even more like an odd duck, even in his own family--so he internalizes a lot (like Jessa).  I think the artist in him also makes him more sensual(he's very sensory), yet he's also got this slightly dominant, slightly controlling, side that only comes out in bed.   Oh, my!

      I hate my ex.  He pulled up in front of my house on Friday in a brand new Expedition (his wife's I presume since he has a truck).  They only have kids four days a month.  And lets not even discuss how much he owes me in unpaid medical bills.  No comments necessary, I just wanted to throw that out there.  After nine years I don't expect anything different from him.  At least my wife doesn't support me.  I don't have a wife but...you know what I mean ;-)  It took me a year to get a divorce but 8/8 is my official 8 year anniversary of freedom from tyranny and oppression (and a man who won't eat leftovers).
