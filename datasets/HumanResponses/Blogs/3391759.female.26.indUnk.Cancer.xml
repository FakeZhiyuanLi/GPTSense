      Talking with my close friend the other night she mentioned our conversations and also my blog and said she had a thought and wondered why i stayed with my b.friend as the things i talk to her about are always the "bad" things he does, but then she said she thought about it some more and realised that she does the same - only ever tells me the "bad" things her partner does. It's not that there aren't any good things becuase there are, but i figure that's what friends are for?! To have a complain and an ear to listen to what your saying.   Well i have one of those good things to share. On Saturday night we were going to a football BBQ and my partners best mate and his girlfriend were going to. The boys decided to go early but i wasn't interested in spending my saturday arvo with all the boys watching footy so i asked best mates girlfriend if she would like to come shopping for a few hours then i'd drive both her and me to the BBQ later in the day. We did this but unfortunatly for me half way thru our shopping trip i got an unexpected migrane, a really bad one at that. Anyway after taking some pain killers i drove the girlfriend to the BBQ but was in so much pain and feelng so ill that i couldn't stay. So my beautiful b.friend offered to drive me home then he would go back to the BBQ.  I was expecting to get dropped off and for him to turn around and go straight back. We got home and after i'd change into my P.J's he layed me on the couch got the doona, tucked me in then made me some toast to settle my tummy. He got me a drink and just generally fussed over me and gave me cuddles and sympathy for half an hour before he headed back to the BBQ.  So there we have it one of the good things we forget to mention. :-)

      I've been looking at numbers for 3 days straight now trying to find any discrepancies in what I think should be there to what actually is there for each month of this year, it's getting to the point where I'm almost completely nutty.  I think there is only so many times one should have to look at the same pieces of paper. ARRRRGGHHHHHHH  Well on the bright side the boss wants it finished by tonight?!*sigh* So I'd better pull my finger out this arvo and get it done but not before lunch - I've decided that I deserve to go to the pub for lunch have a nice meal and a beer then come back and get stuck into it.  Maybe that will clear my head and I can start on it again refreshed.  I don't know how accountants do it. Seriously doing this every day would send me batty, so i take my hat off to all accountants! But i've spoken to the boss and "we've" decided that this really needs to be done EVERY month, so that will make my life a hell of alot easier, but untill then i still need to get one more product done for the year and i will have finished.  Lunch time Woooo Hoooo!!!!

      I'm sitting here at work just taking a five minute break from looking at accounting figures.  I used to despise all accounting but through my job have had to deal with it.  I still don't find them the most fascinating job to do but it does get the old mind working especially at the end of year, which is what we are getting organsied for at the moment.  I'm pretty much going through an entire years accounts trying to find errors which i can tell you is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Part of the fristration is that the errors i'm finding are ones i've already told the accountant about but he hasn't adjusted them so i'm just going over the same things over and over.  I'm almost ready to spit the dummy because every time i start getting into it and getting my head around the numbers the bloody phone rings, and then i have to start again - this is getting seriously hazadous to my health.  The weekend was very quiet indeed.  Headed home Friday night after working late to find the b.friend had already gone out jumped on the internet for a while and turned the stereo up loud to annoy the neighbours and was pretty much in bed by 10 pm - pretty sad really.  Saturday i thought i was going nuts i was so bored, you know those days when you just feel utterly bored with everything, and you can't even motivate yourself to get off the couch ??!!  And Sunday - well sunday was the same as saturday.  What a wonderful life we live.

      Ok what's the deal with some of you boys.  The other night I was looking through one of my Asian cook books showed b.friend the recipe and he said "yep I want that tomorrow night" so yesterday instead of having lunch I went down to the supermarket and bought all the necessary ingredients to make this dish. I got home from work took the dog for a run then came home to start my cooking adventure. Ok it took me over an hour and a half to make everything the lamb balls and sauce and when I'd finished b.friend turns around has a taste test and then has a sulking episode because the dish is spicy hot, as we knew it would be, but apparently it was going to be too hot for him, so he cooked the rice but continued his sulk fest.  Anyway the end of the story was I served it up and he loved it, it wasn't too hot for him at all, so all that sulking for NOTHING! What does it take to make him happy - not the fact I missed lunch to go shopping, or the fact I spent 2 hours cooking for him, or that I had to put up with his shit!  Oh well I know I'm not so perfect all the time but at least I think when he goes out of his way to do something special (very rarely) I appreciate it and don't sulk if it turns out differently than I thought.  And to end this blog my legs are killing me - I usually walk with a friend but for different reasons this hasn't been happening so I thought when I don't' walk with her I will take the dog for a run just so I can maintain the weight I lost and be a little healthier. Last night was the 2nd night in a row I took the puppy for a run and jeeze am I feeling it. OUCH but I suppose it's all the better for me!

      Men. . . . .  In particular "my" man. God he annoys me sometimes, sitting on the phone having a conversation about bills, whose paid what and how much they come to, which eneded up all fine. teh he tells me that he got a water bill for the investment property that his best mate and girlfriend are renting from us and i asked one simple question which was how much the bill as and how much the tenants had to pay. so he cracks the shits at me and tell me that i "always question him about the investment property" Well der. . . He's charging them under what they should pay for rent, doing the gardening himself - fixing and paying for things that their dogs have broken and he wonders why i ask questions. HELLO they are taking advantage of you, maybe not intentionally but they are, and it really gives me the shits that he won't or can't see it.  So in the end i could sense world war 3 beginning so i just said goodbye then hung up not waiting for him to say anything, so he calls me back and makes a smart arse comment then starts having a go AGAIN - i just said i don't have time for this goodbye and hung up again. Well now that i've got that off my chest time to finish some work then go home to walk the dog and cook the dinner but first  Peak hour traffic OH what a joyful life!

What i'll do though is copy my previous blogs and put them all in one post here, that way i won't lose any more than i already have.  Hello to everyone and i hope you enjoy if not too bad! ;-)

      Well today was my Monday as we had a long weekend. I hate having to come back to work after trying to relax, why is it that even having 3 days off never feels like enough? I alwasy seem to sit there on the last day before work and think what have i done with the precious days off? Not much is usually the answer. when it comes to weekends i tend to think i should do alot of things ie housework, washing, shopping and mostly visiting people but come the last day of the weekend i have accomplished nothing so i spend the day or evening rushing around trying to get everything done before work the next day. I must say though i did enjoy a couple of sleep in's over the weekend that is untill 7.30am on Monday when the next door neighbours decided to start work on their house - what a wake up call that was!!!   I did actually manage to make some curtains for the kitchen window though a good feat since i've never made anything like that before and they look good too   Well thats my thougths for the arvo  bye

      Ok so i took my friend out for dinner, we went to a nice little italian place about 5 mins walk from home. nice enough food and reasonable meal. We had a great time it was nice to get out and have a chat and a laugh. Next door to the italian place is an "adult" shop so we decided to stop in and have a look  . Absolute classic. We rolled on in had a good old look around and we both even bought a couple of things, 2 minutes into the shop door the guy who's working there was very friendly always willing and eager to answer any question we may have and boy did we have a few!    Good vibrations it was called it has some pretty good things there but also other things that just don't and never will "do it" for me. We spent probably close to an hour there. All in all a very good girly evening with no b.friends, husbands or children!  Well after a few drinks a good meal and even better company i think i'll sleep very well tonight.

      well i'm feeling much better today    Went home last night and just chilled out for a while made terrayki stir fry for dinner which is just what i needed. We'd been eating lasagne for 5 days because for mothers day i made 2 big ones for lunch so we were eating the left overs.  A long weekend is upon us here in chilly Adelaide, South Australia, looking forward to that but will be mainly car hunting so fingers crossed i find a decent little car to buy.  Tonight i'll be going out with a girlfriend and buying her dinner and maybe a few drinks - she's a mother of 3 and doesn't get very much "her time" so she'll enjoy getting out without the kids for a change, and i'll enjoy doing something nice for someone other than the b.friend.  well there's work to be done so i should probably finish that .  Cheers

      Like everyone i too have bad days. It started off last night the boyfriend fell asleep on the couch then came to bed when i was asleep, being as noisy as he possibly could. I must've grunted or something cause he turned around and started stressing about how i should'nt get shitty when he "accidentally" wakes me up. so he gets into bed then starts tossing and turning, just being a pain in the butt. In the end i got up and went into the spare bed to actually get SOME sleep. Then this morning i pretty much ignored him, while he tried to be nice.  Work is boring as hell this week as i've done all my months end work (early) and now have nothing to do, the boss will be back from sydney tomorrow so maybe i'll finally have some work to do. I get tired and frustrated when it's so quiet here, not only that but it makes the days drag and they seem to last forever.  Recently sold my car to buy a more relaible one and had some cash left over so i went and bought some new clothes yesterday, i thought i'd done very well untill i got home and showed b.friend, he says the shirts i got are too big for me, never mind the size smaller is too small!!!!  and the other tops i got wouldn't be what he'd choose for me. Well he says he likes the pants i bought - oh goody at least i got SOMETHING right for the day.    Oh he'd been online on one of those dating sites too sending complete strangers messages sayign he'd like to get to know them better. This has happened before and he said that he wouldn't do it any more - my arse he wouldn't. Last time he actually arranged to meet the girl in person, but she stood him up. when i fronted him about it he lied lied lied, then said that he "just wnated to find out if the online dating was for real" Yes it's for real why the hell do you think people register and pay for memberships!  anyway time to go now. peak hour traffic here i come

      So it's another wet, rainy and miserable day here in Adelaide.  don't get me wrong i love winter but only if i'm snuggled up at home or somewhere i can just sit back nice and warm and listen to the rain and not have to worry about work.  My birthday's coming up in 18 days and the b.friend wants to know what i want.  it's like this every birthday and christmas he asks for a list for him and his family i write a list out and then never get anything from it! Quite funny when you think about it, not that i'm fussed either way, i'd be quite happy with a romantic birthday meal and some pampering, but instead i know that i'll be cooking the meal and the cake for his family so we can celebrate my birthday.   Why is it that as you get older you look forward to your birthday less - for me it's not that i'm getting older i don't care about that part - i just don't know what it is - maybe it's that when you were little birthday's were so special and everyone helped make you feel special on the day but as you get older no one really remembers or knows it's your birthday untill you tell them.  That and spending the day at work often takes the fun out of it. But this year my birthday falls on a Saturday - yippeeeeeee so maybe what i'll do is make an appointment to have my hair cut and coloured and get a facial and a massage - yes that sounds nice and relaxing - unless of course i am hosting the birthday celebrations at my place again this year.  You see my aunty and i share the same birthday so it's either her or myself that hosts the family gathering which is a hell of alot of work.  Not to be childish or silly but just once i would like my birthday to be MINE amongst my family and not have to share, on refelction of that comment it does sound both childish and silly but I DON'T CARE.  Well as today is the end of the financial year i sould be getting back to it.

      Do you ever get so bored with your life and wonder what the hell happened??  The past few weekends especially i have had this thought.  Maybe it's the weather so cold and miserable i can't be bothered going out or doing much or then again maybe it's just the way my life is at the moment.  Out of nowhere last night i exclaimed to the boyfriend "I need some stimulation in my life" and no not that kind ;-) well that kind too.  he he he  But seriously though i'm going nuts with boredom and the same things week in week out. I want something new.  I know the only way things happen in your life is if you make them happen - i just don't know what to do or what i want right now.  I've always dreamed of traveling outside Australia but unfortunatley circumstances didn't work out that way and i'm now in debt and need to work full time to pay that off. It's not only that there's alot of factors.  I can plan to travel in the future thats' fine but i need something new in my life now i'm not sure what how or why at this stage but hopefully i'll figure it out.

      We had a kind of busy weekend. Saturday the in-laws came down from the country and as my last post i didn't get anything done in the house. I got up at about 8am and did a quick tidy of the house had a shower then the inlaws rocked up. They were on their way to sydney and came down early to help the b.friend build a proper gate for the carport so we don't have any more little accidents with the dogs and the car. So I tagged along with the mother in-law to go pick up a wedding picture so she could take it to my sister in-law's in Sydney, we went and bought some pickets for the gate then went home. We both pretty much stood around chatting and rolling our eyes at the boys trying to put this gate up. Like father like son i've decided is a very appropriate phrase for my b.friend and his dad, both of them almost identical in the way they handled the stress of putting a gate up. At one point mum in-law and i had to leave cause they were getting pissed at each other and we couldn't stop laughing so we popped down to the 2 dollar shop and had a browse. She even bought me a case to put my stickers in from Saneswappers (see my links) The boys got the gate fixed to the house ( a little wonky but it's up) then it was time for the in-laws to go.  I was planning on a quiet night in but got a phone call asking if i'd like to go to a house warming party with b.friends best mates g.friend, so i thought why not i'm up for a good party.   Boy was i wrong, we got there and there were like 5 other people that of course i didn't know (She works with them). Anyway standing there trying to include myself in the conversation was an interesting feat in itself- one guy she was talking to (in her words is sooooo sweet) would just bypass me and anything i had to say, nodding his head at me then changing the conversation back to his and her work, i felt kind of strange. He was just giving off vibes of not wanting to include me - he wanted her all to himself, it was an interesting set up considering his wife was there also, it's either that or he really didn't like me . A few other people turned up then the whole group except myself and her started playing hackey sack that was the point when i was sure i needed to go home. Hackey Sack i'm afraid just doesn't interest me in the least!  So by 3am she finally had the hint that i was keen to head home - only by that stage she had drunk far too much to drive and it started thunder and lightning outside so we called a cab. There were a couple of really nice people at the party and it was great to chat to them - but overall the party    Sunday was football day i went with my mum to a corporate box which is always nice, Mum got plastered so i had to drive, we ended up stopping at the pub on the way home and mum had even more to drink  , so i had to drive her home then get picked up by b.friend. I'm really glad Mum had a chance to relax and enjoy herself she's been working so hard for the past 6 months not just at her work but with looking after my grandparents in her spare time.   Monday was awesome i slept in cooked a thai green curry did my washing and watched TV.   So thats pretty much it for my weekend nothing major or exciting but it ended up being quite a decent weekend

      Today is Friday at bloody last.   What an interesting few days i've had. relationship issues My b.friend is starting a new job next week and has been at home for 3 weeks now and he's starting to drive me nuts.    He has done housework while he's had time off which i appreciate very much but also considering i'm at work from 7.30am till 5pm every day so he should, i've still done the majority of the cooking as he can never decide what he bloody wants for dinner, but i'd rather eat my cooking than his anyway!   Lets start with the lack of sleep becuase of b.friend. I go to bed relativley early say 9-9.30pm and i'll either read or watch TV for a bit then go off to sleep. He has formed a habit of falling asleep on the couch and coming to bed at all hours. Now i wouldn't normally have a problem with this but considering EVERY night he wakes me up when he does come to bed is getting increasingly frustrating. Most people would think oh she's asleep i'll be quiet - not my boy- i swear he doesn't think at all sometimes. He's stopped turning the light on in the bedroom when he comes to bed now (after many disagreements) which is a good thing but i wish he could just SHUT UP - he brings our dogs to sleep on the floor next to the bed and that's always a huge kerfuffel. I get woken up to NO SIT LAYDOWN SLEEP TIME and wonder if he's yelling into a megaphone. After the dogs are in their bed he throws the covers back on our bed and jumps in, then decideds he wants to cuddle, so he moves over to my side of the bed and ends up throwing what feels like his entire body over mine. I'm not a really cuddly type of person when i'm asleep i like to be able to move when the need arises. Then he sniffs and he'll sniff again and not just a quiet sniff but a huge SNIIIIFFFFFFFFFFFF, now this is my breaking point. At 2 am the last thing i want is someone sniffing in my frickin ear!  Well now i've gotten that off my chest i feel much better!   Saturday the in-laws are coming down first thing spending most of the day with us then they are flying out to Sydney for the weekend, which kinda blows my plans for Saturday out the window. I was planning on food shopping then cleaning my car and doing all the housework so i have the rest of the weekend to do with what i please. I'm going to the Port Power footy match on Sunday with my Mum, she got corporate box tickets from work so i'm looking forward to that- free food and alcohol no work Monday- i'm there with bells on! Then Monday i was hoping i could laze about watching TV all day in my trackies but we'll have to see about that now.   Anyway back to work.

      Well it's Tuesday afternoon and there's only 40 minutes till work is out!   I spent all morning flat out trying to get things in order for the accountant only to discover that i have not received 4 supplier invoices for last month so now i have to chase them up which will take another few days. The boss is in Japan at the moment so it's very very quiet here which is nice cause i get to pretty much do as i please - if i want a long lunch i'll take it!   We had a major drama last night. My b.friend has quite an expensive car so it gets locked up under the carport every night and gets treated better then me. I had just jumped into bed when i heard this huge BANG went out to the carport and our dogs had pushed the wire fence out from what was holding it onto the car. It must've been a huge jump cause the wire was all over the windscreen and roof, so of course there were scratches all over the bonnet, windscreen, roof and side of the car. He was not a happy boy, ranting and raving at the dogs  , i told him i knew it was bad but to just calm down a little bit then he took my head off. So i thought fuck you and went inside and left him to sulk by himself. I know it sucks and i'd be angry too but sometimes he just can't control his temper and it gets out of hand, don't get me wrong he doesn't get physical with me - if he did i'd get physical back, he just gets soooooo angry - it's not pretty.   Anyway i haven't spoken to him since last night so i'd say he's still fuming and hopefully he'll be out when i get home cause i'm just not in the mood for his mood swings tonight

      I have never been so angry at another driver than I was this afternoon!  We'd just been to visit my b.friends parents out in the country about 2 hours from home. We jumped in the car and headed on our way doing the speed limit 110km's on the long country roads when we came upon a car, as we got closer we realised he was only doing like 60 along this road and when he saw us he started slowing down.  Not being able to overtake as it wasn't safe we sat behind him for a bit and i saw the big paper sign taped along the bottom of his back windshield, written in texta was   "IF YOUR GOING TO TAILGATE, TAILGATING IS ILLEGAL, I WILL SLOW DOWN!!"      This guy started completley slowing down and we realised he thought we were tailgating him!! In the end this IDIOT slowed to about 20km's then stepped on his brakes making us having to stop suddenly. At this stage it was safe to over take him so we did and on our way past he stuck his finger up at us, so i wound my window down to tell (should i say yell at) him i thought what he did was dangerous but he didn't even look.  Turning around and looking at the cars behind us we saw that we weren't the only ones he did it too.   People like this need their licenses revoked - I hate people who tailgate as much as the next guy but to actually say you hate it and then purposely cause someone to almost run up the arse of you is absolute insanity!  He IS the type of person that causes the accidents and this wanker needs to take a good hard look at himself.  If your a slow driver on country roads that's your choice but to slow down to 20 in a 110 zone in the middle of the road with cars coming up behind you your just a WANKER.  And i hate to say it but one day soon he will do this to the wrong person and get the snot kicked out of him.  Not only does this idiot put him and his wifes lives in danger theythreaten everyone else on the road too. I need to say it again mate you are a complete and utter dickhead!

      This is a great exercise try it and you'll surprise yourself.  I Remember. . .   My first kiss - I was in year 8 his name was James.  His Mum was driving us and some friends to our theatre rehearsal and he kissed me while we were in the back seat of the car.  The smell of winter when I was growing up - the pot belly stove burning in the living room and Sunday nights when Mum would wash my hair, wrap me in my bunny towel then dry my hair by the stove.  When life seemed hopeless and I gave up on everything and everyone - not having the life experience to realise I'd be ok if I only hung on.  Spending days on end in the neighbours pool in summer only coming out for lunch.  Snuggling on Mum's lap for cuddles when I was small enough to fit.  The summer I was 18, unemployed and a "beach bum" a girlfriend and I spent every day at the beach and the cafe and at night we partied in the nightclubs, not caring what life held. Oh what a glorious summer that was!!!  What do you remember?

      Well it's been a while since my last post.&nbsp; Since then i've had a week off work "celebrated" my birthday and been so sick with the flu.    &nbsp;  Well the inlaws came down the weekend before last and as i said in one of my last posts i didn't get anything off my list :-) but hey i expected that.&nbsp; They did give me a beautiful winter jacket, a handbag and a roasting dish though so no complaints from me. Also we went out for a nice lunch and a few beers so that was lovley - i didn't have to cook after all. I decided that for my birthday i was going to give myself a present and decided to get my hair cut and coloured so the saturday before my birthday i went off to the hairdresser, who had the sneezes and running nose, that didn't bother me i didn't think i'd get sick this year. She did a great job on my hair and as i found out on Monday gave me the flu also!&nbsp; So anyway Monday morning was like any other Monday but then around lunchtime i started feeling really yucky all blocked up and disgusting - yes i ended up with the flu.&nbsp; So my boss made me take the week off work and i celebrated my birthday by spending the day in bed sleeping!! &nbsp; It wasn't all bad though my parents took me and b.friend out for Chinese food on Sat night and we had a great time lots of conversation and a couple of bottles of wine so in the end despite spending the day in bed i really did enjoy my birthday dinner alot - so thanks Mum and Dad. &nbsp; Well since i leaving soon bye for now

      Do you ever feel like just giving up, i think i've lost faith today. I'm just so tired of fighting for what i want and need. it seems like an endless struggle to be heard above other peoples thoughts. I know you should always come first in your own life but there is always respect for other people you have to consider and how your actions are going to affect them.  in my life there is one person that just doesnt' seem to give a crap what he does or how it will affect me - i'm fed up tired and nearing the end of my patience.  I seem to have to say the same things over and over - after i have said them the next 10 minutes are great but after that all is forgotten and we're back to the way we used to be.  It's driving me nuts.  I lived on my own for years and loved it and a year and a half ago i moved in with him - at first it was really hard to get used to but even now i sit back when i get some time to myself and i still miss being on my own.  Maybe moving in was a mistake, maybe the whole frickin relationship was a mistake - i just don't know anymore.  I'm not being listened to or should i say i'm not being heard and i don't know how to make things any clearer than i already have. I've given things more than a shot i've put my heart and soul into this thing called a relationship but as usual seem to give more than i get - i'm not talking material possesions or even love i'm talkig about repsect, caring and consideration.  anyway i could keep dribbling but have heaps to do here at work so i really need to go. *sigh*

      A little something different today one of my poems.   A broken soul,  To hard to repair.  A gentle look,  No one's ever going there.  You need to trust,  To allow love to grow,  But once it's been jaded,  They've broken the flow.  A fragile heart,  The slightest nudge, it breaks!  So much to give,  Yet they only ever take
