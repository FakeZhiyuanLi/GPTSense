      I burned my middle finger with a cigarette ember this morning.  It still hurts.  That was 35 minutes ago.  I have apple juice.  It is yummy.  It contains 100% juice and is made by Dole.  It will probably give me heart burn later but it is yummy now.  I have a lot of work to do and have not yet started.  This means I will be very busy later.  Every action has a reaction.  heh.... it's going to be one of those days.    Last night I went to the diner, big surprise.  We've gotten Jimmy, Michelle and Jenni hooked on Scrabble.  It's quite amusing.  We started playing M:TG instead.  Got to see my rm Matt last night which was cool.  He works so much and whatnot and we don't really go out... so it's like Matt doesn't really live there. :)  Then Leo & McCormick came by which was cool.  Talked to them for a few and then they went to do their own thing (yapping about their LARP).    The diner is making me get less sleep.  I go there because I don't have to sit in my house & the wait staff is awesome.  I don't have to get up to do anything but pee. hehehe.  I get to see the few random people that I do like on a regular basis without having to go to parties and whatnot.  Yeah... I'm so boring.   I think I slept on my eyebrow ring funny or something.  It really fucking hurts this morning.    My "new way of life" starts Monday.  Wish me luck.

      I want to be more than I am.  I don't want to be bitter anymore.  I'm so tired of wishing people would grow up.  Tired of people throwing their temper tantrums and drama fits and wanting me to be someone I'm not.  I don't give a shit that you're having a busy day, I'm sorry but I just don't believe that gives you the right to treat me like shit.  More and more I feel the distance of those younger than me and I wonder what was so different about my life that made me grow up so fast.  Sometimes I don't want to grow up.  I wish that I could just worry about what my hair looked like and what clothes I wore instead of what bills I was going to pay and my future.  I wonder when I'm ever going to be able to own a house with CJ.  I wonder how we're going to pay at $10k debt from his school loans that I shouldn't even be responsible for.  That was years before he met me and dammit he probably should have taken care of that long ago.  What do I know?  I know that I have to deal with these things because there is no changing the past.  I've come to terms with that.  Now the real question is how do I get enough money to pay that back, get a new car and eventually buy a house.  Usually you dig your own hole and bury yourself in it only to have to dig back out.  Well it seems like someone else dug my hole and threw me in it.  Now I'm scrambling to get out but have no idea how to.  Which way is up?    Of course I made mistakes with my own money.  If I had been smart I would have started saving when I started working at 15 - but I was only a kid and yearned for the things my parents never gave me.  I don't ever want to hear about someone's life being so hard when they don't have a car payment or an insurance payment.  Don't get me wrong, I understand that situations are different.  Grass is always greener on the otherside and all that nice bullshit... but I still have the right to not want to deal with others complaining of it, don't I?   I'm tired of people I work with bitching about things at work; I tell them how they could fix whatever is wrong and they don't care.  How can you continue to work in a miserable enviroment when the solution is given to you?  It makes me want to smack those people and say "If you won't fix it then shut the fuck up!" and leave it at that.  I hardly ever speak of work anymore.  People ask me how works been and I say "Sucks as usual" or "busy as always" or something to that effect.  If you catch me at the moment when someone has pissed me off, sure I'll go off and tell you what just happened.  But for the most part, what does it matter to the other person?  It doesn't.    Why don't people offer solutions anymore?  You tell someone about something that's wrong and they say "oh that sucks" or just sit there and nod their heads.  And yet when you tell someone about something where you just want to get it off your chest, they want to give you a million solutions to your problem.  That always cracks me up.  So I've just stopped talking to people about my problems in general.   Do you see what I mean about not wanting to be so bitter anymore?  How does one start over?  Is there a reset switch on life that no one has shown me yet?  If I poke myself in my left eye really hard and stick my finger up my nose at the same time will it hit that special reset button and start me over?   Monday I start my diet over and I'm actually buying sneakers so CJ & I can go walking.  I'm going to start exercising in the morning again and sticking to my meal plan.  I haven't completely fallen off the wagon but I've relaxed too much to where I lost 5 lbs and that's all... and that's all it'll ever be if I don't start doing something about it.  I actually wrote a little time schedule out for myself so that I knew I had enough time to do everything and still get to work on time (for the morning stuff).  And I have the evening planned out as well as far as when I eat and when I walk.    I do realize that I am depressed.  I do not need a psychologist or psychiatrist to tell me that.  I am so fully aware of it that it's frightening.  I watch my moods swing and wonder if I'm truly insane.   It's all relative anyhow.   Sometimes I miss who I used to be.  Othertimes I realize what an idiot I was back then.  Then I understand that I started to make a transition and just got lost along the way.  I will rediscover myself.  I will be pretty.  I'm not striving for gorgeous or beautiful even, I just want to be pretty.  I used to be so thin and took it for granted.  I used to have clear skin and took that for granted as well.  Now the outside matches the inside and karma has truly fucked me.    Thank you karma, I had a lovely time.    I'll be better... some day soon I hope.  It all has to start somewhere and I know that somewhere is me.  See I can get it all together, I know how.  Now the only thing I have to get is M O T I V A T I O N and it will be mine.

      I am n o t h i n g.  Tragically nothing to worry about - no one to care for.  I feel empty today.  As if all the world was gray; I fight for my own color to remain but I feel it being sucked away.  I try to find the meaning in every little thing as if all the minor details mattered in some way.  It's frustrating and so simple.  I never believed I could be so full of anger.  I get so angry so easily these days.    I'm mad that my room mate bitches about the ants but does nothing about it - rather sits on his jobless ass and does nothing around the house.   I'm mad that my job sucks so bad and I so like what I do.   I'm mad about what CJ did this weekend.   I'm mad about my bills.   I'm mad about owing the federal gov't almost $900.00.    I'm mad that my father is too much of a pussy to tell my mom what's going on in his head instead of staying out until the wee hours of the morning and making her heart twist into untyable knots.    I'm mad that I only lost 5 pounds and Sarah (who I think is bulemic) has lost somewhere around 30 in a month or two.    I'm mad that it's time for me to go on my smoke break and I'm not done posting yet. ;)

      I am so tired of people bitching or commenting on stuff when they themselves don't do shit about it.  I can't pay cable and neither can CJ - so I called Matt and told him I was selling books to see if I could get the money.  I got $15.00 .... I had to buy contact solution and put gas in my car.  Now I feel awful because Shell just told me that Matt C couldn't pay cable and now I feel like I should do everything I can to pay Matt.  So now I'm going to go sell CD's and see if I get $49.00.  ARGH!   So the part about people complaining or commenting about shit - Matt C keeps mentioning the ants.  So I just left a comment on his blog saying maybe he should get a job and go fucking buy ant spray since CJ & I have bought 2 cans so far.  It makes me so fucking mad.  He doesn't have a job - I work my ass off and still can't pay my fucking bills.  Ugh.

      The new computer is up and running at work.  I enjoy it much as I know that it is mine and that I am solely responsible for it.  No one else can mess with it.  It stays in my office and it gets locked in there when I am not present.  I feel like I have accomplished a goal.  Sad to say that it's the little things that make me happy and this has done so.   I am tired today.  Sore from my new regimen of exercise.  Once again I was not asleep before 1am yet up at 7a.  I know I know, so many people only need 4-5 hours of sleep and I am weak.  A plague on your house, I need my rest.    I was going to put a comment system on this blog but wanted to be boring and use one that's free.  The one I found isn't accepting any new sign ups until later this month so unless I decide to suck it up and do it in flash and host it on my own site... I guess I'll be waiting until the end of May.  I haven't yet decided which I would rather do but I know that I have not been on my computer at home much so it makes no difference.   I go through cycles where I don't wish to sit at home anymore and then cycles when you can barely tear me away from the computer.  I love my machine.  Lain is my idol.  I am a dork.  I have accepted it and decided I can live like that.   There are still ants in our house.  I ran out of money and can't afford to go get ant traps and the like.  I was seriously pondering buying some chalk tho and making millions of chalk lines all in the house.  You have to admit that it would be a blast!  hehe.  That tickles.   I decided on how to make my future children behave when driving in the car with only their mommy.  I would start to pull into a busy intersection very slowly, telling them that mommy was going to kill them and herself and that Daddy would then hate them all.    It's awful I know...but it was fucking hillarious when I told CJ that.  He looked at me in amused horror (if there is such a true thing) and I said "You don't want to have kids with me anymore, do you?" and he said "no" and I said "because of what I just said?" and he nodded and then we laughed.  It was even better when I told Leo.  I knew he'd appreciate my cynical ways.  He always does.    Well I'm sitting at work as normal and I'm sleepy so I needed something to stimulate my brain just a tad.  I suppose now that I'm no longer about to let my head land on the desk with a thud followed by my snores that I should get back to work.   I only have 30 minutes to go.

      People who boycott the French and Canadians are just plain morons.  It's ok to be patriotic and to love your country.  It's ok to say "I'm really angry at France" but it's completely stupid to hurt those who are French or who run French restaurants.  I mean really - if you go to a French restaurant in the United States do you really think it's going to hurt France's economy?  No.  Because most of those people are American citizens.  What about all of you who are Irish, Scottish, British, German, African, etc.  Are you going to boycott any race of people who you have disagreed with?  That's not patriotism, that's racism as far as I'm concerned.  And you can argue that all white people are one race and that all brown people are one race but really - that's untrue and unfair.  It's all about the heritage folks.  It's about being proud of where you come from and who you are.  Then it also becomes a matter of respecting others because they all have heritage as well.  It's good to be proud - it's great to be supportive of your country.  It's ridiculous to blame one government's decision on the entire populace of people.  How many times has Bush said something you completely disagree with?  I know with me he's said tons of things I don't like and personally I can't stand that dumbass.  That is my *opinion* and I stand by it.  I certainly do not hate all republicans because that's what party he is.  I don't hate everyone who voted for him.  I do not blame the United States as a whole for him being in office.  All of you who bitch and complain about the French, the Canadians, NATO, etc., you're all a bunch of blundering bigots.  I feel sorry for you.  Mostly I feel sorry for those you harm in your misguided abundance of hate and stupidity.  It makes me angry and it makes me want to stand up and fight.  So how do you fight your own countrymen?  Am I supposed to start rally's "For Love of Everyone"?  Haha.  Yeah I see that rally going real well.  Perhaps I am naive to believe that the world will some day all come together and work peacefully like a well oiled machine.  I suppose I am an idealist.  I believe that we all should make some sort of effort though.    If there is intelligent life on other planets and aliens have truly visited but not publically made themselves known, I know why.  It is because the people of Earth are not ready to accept anything new or contradicting to their own beliefs.  We're still fighting wars based on religion when we should be fighting against things like poverty and hunger.  Fighting to save our resources and our forests.  Fighting to make sure that we aren't killing random species of animals, plants and insects.    Instead we bicker and kill each other.   It's a sad day when you start to lose the belief and hope for humanity as a whole.   Dear Aliens,   On your way to Pluto please pick me up.   Signed,  Misty

      I think my brain has decided that sleep is unnecessary.  I am not very happy with my brain at this moment.  My body is especially unhappy with my brain.  I wish the both of them would get along so that I could get at least one good night of restful sleep.  Tossing and turning is taking it's toll.  I am unmotivated at work for longer periods of time than normal.  I'm fighting very hard to stay at work for my full shift.

      It's raining today.  It's supposed to rain for the next six days per my co worker.  He's very big on the weather.  Very into making sure his yard is mowed and pretty.  I find it humourus when our grass is about waist high in the back yard.  I feel pretty useless today as far as working goes.  I just can't get into the groove of things.  That's pretty bad after being gone for a whole week and having all this work I need to get caught up on.  I can't find it in myself to care.    I'm a little sad that I haven't written anything in awhile.  I know it's just my random writer's block and soon I'll be writing things and not finishing them as usual.  I can't ever finish anything I guess.  I mean sure I've accomplished things, but really I think it's only out of necessity.  Books.  I finish books.  Quickly.   I'm reading a new book:  Blood Legacy - The Story of Ryan by Kerri Hawkins.   So far as I'm into it (not very far) I can tell that it's about an immortal (maybe a vampire) and it's telling her story as well as the present at the same time.  It flips back and forth.  I like stories like that.  Giving you everything you need to know.  I've always been a fan of outrageously long novels.  As long as they are Fantasy and not some murder mystery.    The cover art is really cool.  Comic book style.  She's looking all mean and sexy and holding a sword at the viewer.  If we could all be crazy beautiful herroines it would be that much better. ;)   Well enough about my book.  I should probably go.

      Life is constant struggle.  Human beings by nature must solve problems and then make more to solve in order to realize their moments of happiness.  Humans cannot just *be* happy and content with their lives.  This is why I admire Buddhists.  They've got it all right - to leave all things behind and become one with themselves and then one with nature and life, etc., etc., etc.    It amazes me the need for drama.  I myself have tried to abandon it but find myself bitching about things that aren't even necessary.  I would not say that I go out and create drama - I'm too tired for that.  But I revel in a bit of it now and then.  Living vicariously through the troubles of others I suppose.    So why does life have to be constant struggle?  Why must we all suffer to realize happiness.  Then if you take those moments of happiness and calm for granted or don't even realize them, then you're definately screwed.

      Mother's Day was May 11th.  My Great Mammaw died that morning.  Most people don't even remember their Great Grandmother's much less know them at an adult age.  I was very lucky to have her around when I was a child and witness the exceptional love and kindness that she showed to us all.  If anyone deserves to be a saint, it is her.  Monday CJ and I left for Louisiana.  It was a very long and tiring drive and took us much longer than it should have to get down there.  Once we got there we were able to sit around for about an hour before we had to get showered and ready to go to the viewing.  This is the second viewing I've ever been to and it was just as strange as the first.  I've never understood looking at the body when they make them so unlike they were in real life.  That and the fact that they don't look dead.  Dead people don't need makeup.  What's the deal with that?    Anywho... then the funeral was the next day (Wednesday) and that was just as tiring.  It's a big ordeal.  I have a huge family.  I remember hardly any of them and they don't remember me.  Which is ok I suppose.  The only shitty thing that happened was my Aunt saying I should have had one of the roses off of the casket but my cousin let her friend have one.  My cousin Richard joked about how I should go beat her up and take it.  I told them both it was no big deal, that it wouldn't last in the hot car anyhow.   I should have taken one.   Then we spent the night with my Mom and Dad and went to bed way too late to be waking up at 4:45am.  We got on the road at 5:30am and drove through a monsoon for about an hour before we outdrove the storm.  We headed up to Arkansas to spend a few hours with his parents since we were close enough.  Neither of us really wanted to tack on the hours to our trip but it was the right thing to do.  Only when relatives die do you realize you don't see them enough.    Then we left and made it back in 20 hours total.  A half hour of that was stopping at a cracker barrel restaurant to eat.  They actually have really good food, so that was nice.   I'm still sad... and tired of people telling me their sorry and whatnot.  I know that's the proper comment to make and all but really I'd rather not be thinking about it at work.    I haven't been sleeping well.  At all.  Ever since Sunday night.  I don't think it has anything to do with Great dying, just coincidence I believe.  Maybe I'm just still overly tired from the trip.  It definately took a lot out of me.   I haven't done a whole lot at work today.  I got the important things done and now I'm just like "blah" and don't want to do anything else.  I'm tired.    We have a house meeting tonight.  Matt's going to get his ultimatum (sp?) so we'll see how that goes.  We get to figure out when we're going to get the carpet installed and I'm going to call Empire to get an estimate.  WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.  ;)   Well I suppose I should get back to work.

      I don't have a lot of time this morning.  I've really got some work to do.  Another 5 hours of sleep last night or there abouts.  Hard to tell when you toss and turn so much.    Sarah is pissing me off.  I don't give a flying rant how angry she is with the world or how much her life sucks.  She has no right to come to a place I invite her to and then be rude to me and my friends.  I'm tired of the attitude.  I keep chalking it up to her being 19 but really she's worse than that.  She thinks the whole world revolves around her and her fucking problems.  Can you tell I'm angry?  Wait til she figures it out.    I'm tired of it.  I've been as patient as I can possibly be but I'm getting very very tired of it.   I watched My Big Fat Greek Wedding last night.  That movie made me laugh SO hard.  I'm not greek and I don't know anyone greek but I come from a pretty big southern family so I can relate with a lot of what was going on.  It was fantastic.    Anywho - gotta get to that work.

      It's 5:45am.  It's still dark outside as she sits up and lets the sheet puddle around her waist.  It's a little cold and goose bumps ripple across her breasts as she yawns and stretches her arms up above her head.  One arm comes down to rest in her lap while the other props itself against her folded legs.  Her sleepy head droops to lay against her fist.  The thought of laying back down to sleep more lingers like a sweet fantasy.    Not this morning, this morning must be like everyone before it.  Sitting up fully once more she stretches across the bed, losing most of the sheet, to claim the remote on the nightstand.  The TV sits directly across from her bed and comes to life as she presses the remote button with a slight 'bleep'.  Cartoons spring to life before her eyes.  The same old cartoon that's on every morning.  They cycle the episodes but never all the way through to the end.  It's almost maddening.  Everyone morning she watches, hoping that one day they will finish the series so that her mind can rest with it's conclusion.  For thirty minutes straight she watches the same episode she's seen at least five times, through commercials and all.  She lays on her stomach, discarding pillows and the sheet, her hands folded beneath her chin.  Her legs bend up at the knee and her ankles are crossed together.  The television has all of her attention.    The credits begin with the end theme and with the same sigh she moves out of the bed and into the adjoining bathroom.  Refilling a glass of water she then moves back into the bedroom taking a nice long drink of water and then placing the glass on her dresser.  In the corner a small computer desk resides.  The monitor and cpu come to life with the touch of one button and a simple "beep".  She moves back to the bathroom to find her glasses and perch them upon the edge of her nose, moving once more into the bedroom.  From the nightstand she produces a pack of cigarettes and lights one.    It's 6:45am.    She opens the window to twenty degree weather heedless of the cold air before turning to find some sort of clothing.  The computer welcomes her with a short phrase, "Good morning" with which she answers a muffled "mornin", cigarette dangling from between her lips, pulling a pair of flannel pajama pants on. Searching for a top she pulls the cigarette from her lips and speaks clearly for the first time, "Check Mail".  The computer screen responds as the mail client opens and begins to pull new messages from the server. She finds a tank top and pulls it over her head, running a free hand through her hair afterwards.  The ash is discarded in a small glass tray before she turns back to the computer to read the subjects of her incomming mail.  "Read mail line 34."  The computer opens the window and then the same female voice reads the message.   "Hey girl, you missed last night but don't sweat it.  There will be another gathering this evening - you know where we'll be.  See you at seven. -L"   "Close mail message."   Another drag from the cigarette and she's smashing it out in the ashtray.  "Read mail line 52."   "New assignment..."   She listens to the monotonous tone almost absentmindedly as she rifles through cd's to find todays music.  A compilation cd is pulled free of the holder and the cd placed into the computers tray.  It sucks the cd in and music begins to pour free.  She pulls a silver pair of headphones off of the montior and slides them over her ears. "Close mail message." She plugs the headphones into the speakers jack and sits indian style in her desk chair.  The headphones serve the purpose of keeping out the rest of the world.   Two clicks and the program has been opened.  The keyboard tray is pulled out and fingers come to rest against it.  She thinks to herself for a few moments before the keys start clicking and her eyes are stuck on the screen.    It's 7:18am.  Her fingers fly over the keys as if she were typing out her life story.  Her eyes are intense on the screen yet her face seems bored.  It's the same thing day after day.  Today is no different.  The cd plays over and over again.  It never changes.  Like the morning cartoon it continues to cycle with no true end. In the middle of her typing a window pops up and a "ping" interrupts the cycle of the music.  She hits shift and home to highlight the code she typed into the window and then hits delete before even reading the message.    "Nate: Have you eaten anything today? Code: Not yet.   Nate: You do realize what time it is? Code: Don't we have the same conversation every day? Nate: I suppose we do.  It's 4:50pm.  You should eat. Code: Yes, I guess.  Nate: I'll see you at 7 right?  Code: Absolutely.  Nate: kay, later.  Code: Bye bye."   It's 4:52pm.   She blinks a few times before taking off her glasses and rubbing at her eyes. Leaving the glasses on the desk, she pushes away from the desk and pulls the headphones from her ears to rest around her neck.  Standing up from the chair she walks back to the nightstand to shake another cigarette from the pack.  Lighting it she walks out of the bedroom finally, through the hallway, into the kitchen.  An orange tabby appears out of no where to walk figure eights through her moving legs.  She stops and looks at the cat a moment, "what?"  Looking at the food bowl she realizes it's also time for him to eat.  Pouring him a bowl of precious cat food she watches him turn circles as he meows at her impatiently.  She sets it down in front of him not bothering to watch him almost inhale the pellets.  Turning back to cabinets she searches them before pulling down a box.  An energy bar is produced and unwrapped.  Moving to the fridge she opens it to pull out a bottle of spring water. Still smoking she goes back to the bedroom, water and energy bar in her other hand.    She puts the cigarette out after one last deep inhalation and goes back to the computer desk.  Sitting down she pulls her legs back and crosses them at the ankles. Replacing her glasses on the end of her nose she looks at the 'food'.  A bite from the energy bar before putting her hands back on the keyboard.  The headphones are left around her neck as her fingers once more fly across the keys.   It's 5:13pm.    She finishes today's assignment and clicks a button to test it.  She watches the program run before her eyes.  Satisfied she zips the file and types up a mail message with the file attached.  "Send mail line 1." Pulling the headphones from around her neck, she puts them back on top of the monitor.   "Select all mail." "Mail selected." "Delete." "Confirm Delete." "Confirm." "Mail deleted."  It's 5:47pm.  Removing herself once more from the desk she strips herself of pajama pants and tank top as she heads to the bathroom.  Knobs are turned for hot and cold and the shower head springs to life with a hot spray.  Stepping into the stall she showers methodically.  Shampoo first, then body wash. Rinse both.  Apply conditioner.  Wash face.  Rinse both. Everything is routine.  She steps out of the shower, pulling a towel from the rack to wrap herself in.    It's 6:12pm.

      She taunts me  ...teases me. A weekend full of her ...and yet. I am left wanting  ...this Tuesday. Like the two full weeks ...before this. A fickle lover  ...she is. Punishing me ...torture. I must make amends ...to receive her. She accepts no apologies ...and I am lost. Without her ...misery. Plaguing me  ...with dreams. For a moments peace ...for rest. I would do anything ...free me.

      Just so I remember...   When Code goes out she sits in the glass DJ booth with the DJ's and just feels the music - the rest of the crowd is sprayed with water, jumping and dancing to the rhythm's they feel more than hear.  There's something seductive about music.    ---  Working on getting back into the groove to finish the story about Code.  Writer's block has been driving me crazy but this is part of what I was thinking about when I couldn't get to sleep last night.  That and writing another story about Angelica.  The character that constantly plagues me is her.  I know I can put all that crazy freeform RP time into some really good stories.    I had another rant in my head earlier but I have forgotten it.  It's amazing how things just slip from your mind.  Now that I think on it more, it wasn't even a rant, it was a poem.  Those are the worst to lose in your head.

      Not much has happened since I last posted.  Well little things have happened but really I only had 5 hours of sleep.  Jeni is no longer allowed to stay so late.  We just yap and yap and yap.  I tell her before she comes over "I have to be in bed by midnight" and she left at 2:30 in the morning.  It wasn't her fault, I kept making her tell us stories.  I was so awake.  My eyes feel like they are going to fall out of my head and I'll be walking around looking at the floor helplessly.  Oh well.   Now I must go find breakfast.    Oh - and I've completely distanced myself from Sarah.  Even though she is now pretty much ready to talk it out and be friends, I cannot do so.  Regardless of whether she's fixed whatever it was she said she needed to fix in her life, she's still all stuck on boys.  She proved that yesterday when a company function forced me to sit next to her and listen to her ramble.  Politely I held the facade.  It was very difficult naturally.  Anywho... so I haven't called her or invited her over and I won't.    Matt's bday party is Saturday.  I've been trying to clean the house but Jeni keeps distracting me. ;)   Oh yeah, breakfast.   Ciao ^_^

      Determination.   That is the key to my success.  Yet I cannot make my determination last long enough to follow through with everything.  Well let me promise myself something one more time.  I promise to quit smoking by Monday and I promise to stop overeating.   I promise to watch my portions and my caloric intake.   I promise to exercise at LEAST three times a week.    I am tired of this.  I will be 24 in a month.  I better reach some goal or I'm going to shoot myself.

      I think that nothing but bad things are in store for me.  Perhaps I make my own luck.  It's very difficult to believe in karma when I know I haven't been this shitty to anyone and yet all this shit is happening to me.   My great grandmother died, had to take a loan out from Focus, got a ticket while I was there ($115), I'm driving without insurance, I'm poor, I owe the Federal Gov't money and don't have $100 to make my first payment.  I have congestion in my chest that won't go away so I'm coughing consistently.  I've cut down on my smoking IMMENSLEY to help with the congestion but it's not really working.  I'm unhappy, depressed.  Poor CJ - nothing is his fault and yet I can't help but be angry when he does the little things.  I am truly going crazy and have nothing to do for it.  Ah well...  Things could be worse I suppose.

      Sometimes I think I can see the lives of those around me falling apart.  I watch my two best friends dance in and out of each others lives.  One too afraid to be with the other and the other too afraid to tell her that he's desperately in love with her.  I help where I can and yet watch the torments of their seperate lives.  Some times I am glad that I do not have to be either of them.    I had a cold last week.  This week I have respiratory congestion.  I cough and I cough and still the rattle drives me crazy.    I've been thinking a lot of days gone by.  I wrote a piece of 'prose' on it the other day and submitted it to  urlLink DeviantArt .    I put chapstick on my lips all weekend.  This morning I forgot it on the nightstand and the skin just slathed off of my lips like sun burn peel.  It reminds me of scars I have.  The new skin trying and trying to grow over but the littlest touch and they break open once more.    Stupid metaphors.

      It's not wrong to forgive someone as long as you never forget.  Just so you're not surprised later on.   So I won't forget but I have forgiven.  Accepted the mistakes for what they were.   Yesterday I was a little crazy.  Maybe a tad hungover.  Well not so much hung over and just tired.  My head only hurt for the first 30 minutes I was awake and then everything was normal.    I'm speaking w/Tamara again.    Not much else at this point.  Wanted to start keeping up with this crazy thing once again. ;)

      Wow I haven't posted in awhile.  Kept thinking about it but just haven't done it yet.  Today's my 24th birthday.  Nothing remotely special but I've had a good day.   My life changes have started and I've been keeping up with them.  I've made a conscious effort not to let my anger get the best of me.  And even when I get perturbed at the little things and rant about them, I notice that I don't feel angry and I feel kind of silly even voicing how I feel.  Or not necessarily how I feel but how I *should* feel by past experience.  CJ's notice the difference and I definately have.   I've also lost 2 pounds.  This is almost nothing, I know.  But it's important to me and I have to be happy because those aren't fluctuation pounds.  I've truly lost them.  Tonight I'm going to have a few drinks at Friday's for my birthday.  I have to remember not to drink beer.  I can't afford the extra calories. ;)   The exercise has not gone exactly as planned but I'm still recovering from my recent bronchitis (sp?).  I have been watching my portions and my caloric intake.  I have not quit smoking.  I am not depressed at this.  I continue to toy with the idea and know that I will do so before the end of the year.  I realize that I cannot keep pushing myself and then punishing myself when I fail.  It's like I'm an adolescent who doesn't need overachieving parents to make them fail - I am the adolescent and parents all wrapped into one.   I know that I will achieve my goals.  I know that they cannot be acheived in a single day, week or month.  I do know that I will achieve them and that I will do it the right way.  :)   I feel happy lately.  Very happy.   Love,  Me

      Is it silly to wonder if a co-workers ex boyfriend has blocked you because you work with the little brat?  I mean... dammit.  He was really cool and I actually liked hanging out with him the very few times that we did.  But Psycho slut really just treated him like a dog and then used the break up to get all the attention she could.    Ok so maybe she really did like him and in her immaturity thought that this would be the one - but really, c'mon, you've got to be kidding me?  And I... I was a good friend... and I put up with it.  And she abused me like there was no tomorrow.  Off handed comments, etc.  Well if I was such shit, why was she clinging to me like she had no other friends.  I mean really... I went through weeks w/out being able to escape her.  It makes the relationship here at work very difficult; especially when I just want to rip out her eyes and skull fuck her with a cucumber.   Harsh, no?   Anyhow.. her ex was really cool... good guy.  I feel bad for him.  Bitches ain't nothin but hoes and tricks?   hehe... yeah I so don't think to that extreme.   I dunno... Life goes on.  Oh well.    I'm going to buy the last chobits manga today.  The special edition box one... so I can put them all in one place and it says it comes with a little figurine as well.  Neat.  Something else I can stick on top of my monitor.  :)   Ciao - lunch time.

      Hello again.  My old friend.  The Hen.   Flashbacks from highschool.  Not that I really attended.  Just that time of year is all.   Sometimes I miss it.  Running around and doing your best not to get caught skipping school.  All the wild drinking and drug use.  Sure, it was reckless and I wouldn't do half of it now.  But who knows?  I think it's really maturity that makes you stop doing those things.  The realization that there will be consequences once you turn 'legal'.  So you have to get it all out of your system at once.  I was one of the most active kids I knew.  I weighed about 95 pounds on average and it was simply because I was always running from the cops or walking the five to ten miles back to school because someone had thought it would be a great idea to walk all the way to wal-mart and shoplift.  I think to myself, "Wow, if I wasn't sitting here at work on my ass almost eight hours a day, I'd be up running around and acting crazy.  Drinking all that alchohol and doing all those drugs, and then I'd be fit.  I wouldn't over eat and I'd be busy.  That's the key!"  So really I could quit my job and do those things but I find that there's one problem with that.  I no longer live with my parents.    Think about it.  We all did that shit because our parents couldn't   really   kick us out.  Well they could but you sure could make them feel shitty for kicking out a 'kid'.  And the law couldn't really touch you too bad.  You get a slap on the wrist or a night in a holding cell.  Been there, done that.  I ain't lyin.    Enough reminiscing.  It's Friday.  More importantly, it's payday.  Would I really want to give up the abillity to earn money and spend it on what ever the fuck I want?  Would I never want to live on my own again?  I mean really, being an adult means that I can drink whenever and whatever (none of that boone's farm shit) I want.  I could do drugs in my house and no one would know.  Maybe I do?  ;)  So I don't really have to answer to anyone but the law.  It just means I have to be a little more careful of what I do and how I hide it.   But man, those were good times.  And sometimes I think that I really would like to go back... but there's pros and cons to both sides and I've rambled on enough about this silly topic.

      The vice president of our company has a signed picture of Bush senior and Barbara hanging on his cork board.  It frightens me.  It makes me want to run into his office screaming about how Bush sucks ass and abortions should be completely legal.  About how God should be COMPLETELY separate from church and state; about how if President Bush says "God Bless" one more friggin time I may actually just have to go on a rampage and get myself admitted to an institution where none of this would matter.   And then I think about my job and how it is paying me.  The money isn't horrible so that's reason enough to stay here and remain calm.   They are sending me to Greenbay, Wisconsin on December 11th and 12th.  It's 44 degrees Fahrenheit here in Maryland right this moment.  I can't imagine what the temperature in Greenbay is.  Wait... Let me go look it up....   ...  ..  ...  ...Ok...It's 30 degrees Fahrenheit there now.  Our high temp today is supposed to be 60 and there's is only going to be 36.  That's a huge difference.   Ok so I'm a spoiled brat because Maryland winters are nothing compared to Wisconsin.  I understand and fully accept that fact.  There's not a whole lot I can do about it.  At least I'm not going to be there for a week like it was originally thought.  Then it was supposed to be 4 days because it'd be a cheaper flight if I stayed over until Sunday.  But now the bosses have figured out that it's not cheaper to stay over the weekend so it'll be a quick flight in and a quick flight out.    I really hate the cold.   I watched "Finding Nemo" last night.  That was pretty humorous.  Well done for the demons of Disney.  I was impressed.     I'm really starting to wonder if my boss realizes that I have no work to do lately.  I mean I guess I could be filing and making sure things are psychotically in order.  But that takes tedious time.  Where as I could just sit here and get paid for wandering around and looking like I'm doing work.  I'm actually getting kind of bored.  I wish a client would call me so that I could get something done.    So I'm quitting smoking & so is CJ.  The date of the cease & desist will be Monday, November 17th.  I've cut down a ton.  I had 5 cigarettes on Monday, 8 on Tuesday, 9 on Wednesday and so far today I've only had one.  When our friend's come over it's much harder to not smoke.  But we won't be smoking in the house as of the 17th as well so that should help.  It was hard enough standing out there to smoke this morning in the freezing wind.    So I've rambled on enough I think.    My life is a total bore.

      I was happily reading Josh A. Cagan's blog when I felt a reminder in my shoe.    l.e.i. makes some ok shoes... I've got a rockin' pair that I love.  But let me ask you this.... What idiot puts a tag in the heel of a shoe.  One that's cloth that you step on every day.  That after a few weeks of wear one end comes unsewn and it just kinda flaps around in your shoe?   So I spent 15 minutes this morning with an exacto knife, in my office, cutting out this tag delicately so that I wouldn't tear the leather it had been sewn into.  After much concentration the deed was done perfectly and now my shoes are tag free.    "Hello love, like some mail?" - that's Outlook Express announcing that I have more spam.  How sweet.    So I will be starting this new diet.  It's the 20/30 diet that was done by  urlLink Dr Gabe Mirkin  whom our company answers for.  So we had two of the books here on display and I decided to borrow them and take a look at the outline of this diet and the recipes included.  It's not bad.  You get 20 grams of fat a day and 30 grams of fiber.  No meats tho... Except fish 2-3 times a week.  It's not horrible.  I definitely don't eat a lot of meat as it is.  Luckily it says that you should follow the diet for 19 out of 21 meals a week - so when I'm feeling like a ravenous beast and I have to have that chuck of cow flesh, I can definitely do so without beating myself up.  So that's quite nice. :)   Anywho - so last night I went to the grocery store and gathered ingredients to make a minestrone soup that followed the diet's requirements.  It had zucchini in it which I have always hated in the past.  But like a good girl I went ahead and put it in along with the two medium onions which I normally wouldn't eat either.  It turned out fabulous.  I've never had a minestrone soup that was so good.  I'm not big on the canned soup so I never buy it.  This damn soup makes 8 servings and it's really filling.  So it's motivated me and made me believe that yes I could do this diet - I just have to get into the habit of cooking again.  It's been so long that I'd nearly forgotten how time consuming it is to make such a huge meal.    I'm also going to have to start drinking coffee black if I really want to follow this correctly.  Right now I'm drinking a large  urlLink Dunkaccino  which is sooooo incredibly fattening it isn't even funny.  But I figure I only have another week to squeeze in the things I'll miss.  Which is not to say I'm going overboard.  My fat ass doesn't need to gain more weight, I just need to enjoy things moderately that I'll never be able to enjoy again.   Speak of which.  The non smoking saga is going well.  We are on day number four.  I had some real bad cravings last night but they weren't withdrawal cravings where I was clenching my jaw, like Monday.  I just realized I wanted one and so instead I had some water. :)  I was cooking at the time and didn't want to eat anything.  All it is now, is the willpower.  I have to not fall into that "oh one cigarette won't hurt" train of thought or I'll be back up to a pack a day. :)  I've rambled enough about my boring life and boring issues for the time being.  I really think I'm the only person who reads this anyhow.  Which is probably how it should be.  Hmmm... I read that one guy got fired for blogging too many details about Microsoft.  Tsk tsk... He was under the warm blanket of the devil and he made a big mistake.  Never fuck with Microsoft.  For every ounce of software you buy from them, that's a little piece of your soul they get to own.   Not saying they don't own my entire soul by now... But it's like nicotine.  The addiction is too great.

      So yesterday I quit smoking.  I didn't have a single cigarette.  I had a headache and my jaw hurt from clenching my teeth all day, but I did well.  CJ has quit also.  Jimmy says that he is quitting but he did have a cigarette yesterday because he had one left over.  I don't know if he's still sticking to that or not.    I don't feel like it's as bad as yesterday.  Really all I want to do is chew on things which naturally makes me just want to eat food.  I've got to really watch that.    They say after the third day your lungs start the healing process.  Dunno if that's true or not but I'm hoping so.  I would think after a week I wouldn't want a cigarette anyhow - so that would be cool.  I have plenty of things to do at home to keep my mind off of smoking.  Last night I got a bunch of laundry done.   Oh... And I gave Binky to a friend.  I just don't have time for him anymore and I felt bad about him being in the cage all the time by himself.  He was a great great great ferret and we had some good quality time last night before he left.  I cried a little.  I will miss him but it's so much better that he can go to a good home.  Jane has another ferret so he'll have someone to play with.    So tonight I get to finish laundry (hopefully) and take apart Binky's cage.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the monstrous thing.  I guess put it in the little storage thing under the stairs.  I've got to clean up the basement as well.  From over the weekend - people were playing pool and manage to always leave a mess.  That's ok.  I don't mind cleaning up.    I wonder if I can talk CJ into helping me get the stairs done this weekend.  Hmmm...   Ok, I'm really rambling and I should pro'ly get back to work.

       urlLink Forbes.com: Holy Influence   What a stupid mother-fucker.    I cheer companies like Motorola, Walt Disney and American Express for supporting Gay & Lesbian rights.  Hurrah to Johnson & Johnson for supporting the morning after pill.  Proving that they understand that they can't go against the prevention of unwanted pregnancy just to support their giant line of children's products.  It's a shame that these people have not evolved to realize that a lot of morals in the bible were to protect man kind in that era.  Do we really need to call condoms a sin (thank you to the catholic church for helping to spread AIDS and the massive population) when at the time it was important to have as many children as possible to work farms and survive disease.  Sure you could have 12 children in the time of Christ but you were likely to lose at least half to mishaps, disease and wild animals.  You can believe in God, Christ, Allah, etc., and be a good person.  You can believe in whatever diety tickles your fancy, but do you need to hate your fellow man so much that you spit on him for his sexual preferences and the right to terminate a pregnancy for health reasons or simply just the right reasons?  Do Jesuit faiths really believe that Gay & Lesbians, Pagans, Those who've had abortions, etc., are really horrible people?  Does it make you the lowliest scum to believe that people of the same sex are attractive and you'd like to spend your life time with them?    Boo hiss to those who can't wake up and smell the java.  Boo hiss to those who call their fellow man a sinner who will never reach the light of God.  How about fighting to save the homeless, the starving, the jobless, the diseased instead of petitioning same sex marriages!  There are more important things in this world than your morals - if saving mankind is what you are concerned about.  If the Christian Coalition would focus more on saving our planet so that future generations can worship their sniveling petty Gods, we'd already be better off.  Instead I see a man who has a plan who is raising money and blacklisting companies for supporting alternative lifestyles, abortion, gambling & porn when he could be putting that money to better use.    It's people like him and his followers that teach their children to shun those who are gay or of a different race.  As far as I'm concerned the hatred towards anyone who isn't a WASP is just as bad as being a racist.  It's people like them who are the causes of  urlLink hate crimes  such as those linked.   urlLink This site  makes me want to vomit.  It's places like these that make me start to lose hope for future generations.  Will the open minded prevail against such trials? Will our children's children one day live in a world where race and sexuality no longer matter?   I can blog no more on this topic as my thoughts are becoming jumbled with the aggrivation I feel towards these idiots.

Watched porn....ate chunky monkey ice cream... and then watched Carnivale and then listened to Jeni moan some more."  You're such a pervert.  Such a bad man.   Yes... quoting porn lines.  It was horrible.  Don't buy cheap porn.  And then don't let your friends bring over really cheap porn because "you have to see how horrible this is!"  I slept horribly.  I had *JUST* fallen asleep when Jeni woke me up to say that the laptop wouldn't save to her floppy.  Damn that laptop.  So then I had to start the sleep process all over again - I couldn't get comfortable.  I know at one point the clock said 2am and I said "fuck" out loud with no regards to CJ sleeping next to me.  I still don't know if that woke him up or not.  We started our new schedule today so we had to be at work at 7:30am.  Our normal shift used to start at 9am.  So it's a bit of a change.  But! I'll be able to leave at 4pm and that is the BEST EVER!!!!!  For someone who'd rather it be dark outside all the time, I sure can't stand to get off of work and there not be any daylight left.  I think it's because I'm programmed that if it's dark outside that means it's late and I've no time to do anything.  That and I like to skip rush hour traffic.   So... the schedule has changed. w00t. :|  So I guess I better go and get some work done.

      Well .... what can I say about today?  So far it's alright.  Yesterday kinda sucked but it was only because of work drama.  Today I have to go and get my new license.  I lost my old one at the Bank.  I left it there and they said they had it and then they couldn't find it.  So I guess that they technically lost it. :)   Not too much on my mind today so I guess I'll go and get some work done.

      My boss doesn't support me.  He'll let this stupid bitch that's been there longer than he has but isn't in an administrative position get whatever the fuck she wants.  Ask me why we kiss her ass?  I have no idea.  Instead it makes it much more peaceful if he just acts like it was my mistake and I didn't know what I was doing instead of just standing up to her.  I'm so pissed right now that he better be glad that I respect he gets up at 5am and that I haven't called him bitching him out for being such a pussy.  Oh well.  Guess it doesn't really matter how I feel about my job.  I must just be a peon and no, I didn't put in 7 years of my fucking life to this company.  No, not at all.  FUCK YOU!   Pardon my language.  I'm obviously not in one of my normal moods.

      I feel blah.  Really down I guess.  Jeni is unhappy with Shelley breaking up with Jimmy (not like I'm thrilled about it or anything) and it's bothering me.  I know she's really good friends with Jimmy but it's not like I'm not friends with him or anything.  I really like him or he wouldn't be my roomy.  It really sucks that Shell broke up with him.  I argued the point with her and she was really sure that it's what she wanted to do.  She just didn't want to be with him. I understand that.  I don't want to have to deal with my friends being bitchy because my best friend didn't want to be with theirs.  Guess what?  The world isn't perfect.  Do you really think that I'm in such a great place where I can live with TWO of my best friend's ex boyfriends and still invite her to the house and have a normal life?   Well of course not.   But I must go now because work is calling me and I have to go help them out. Stupid fucking supervisors....if they could do their jobs, this wouldn't happen.

       urlLink bobby burgess photography :: newer :: 6   Sometimes I wonder if someone is looking in on my little life and wondering if I'm ok.  Then I realize that most of the world is shit and people just don't care.  Bobby's a cool guy.  He lives 20 mins from me if he's still in Baltimore.  I don't know Bobby at all.  Once I emailed him because I was sure I had gone to school with a Bobby Burgess but he never responded.  If he's been in Baltimore his entire school career then I never knew him.  I don't know him now.  But he's a free spirit.  His journal speaks of random trips across the country.  I envy the freedom.  Not that I'd go anywhere. ;)  Perhaps I envy the courage.    So I hope Bobby's ok.  Because I may not have anything to do on a random Tuesday morning if he never posts on his journal.  He hasn't in awhile you know... oh well.    So this is week three and I haven't touched a cigarette since November 16th.  I don't miss it.  I think I gained 10 pounds during the initial week or so.  I've been a little more motivated lately.  I've been keeping the house clean in a sort of OCD way.  I've also started cooking again even though it's mostly soup.  I'm trying a high fiber low fat diet.  I didn't do so well last night since I had two pieces of pumpkin pie - but that's because I wanted to eat it before I got really serious about the diet and I can't let pumpkin pie just sit around the house. ;)  Tonight I'm making vegetarian chili.  Hopefully it turns out as well as the minestrone.   So I feel like I'm either getting to the point where I don't really want to be around my friends again.  Or they don't want to be around me.  I can't figure out what it is.  Shell broke up with Jimmy yesterday and I was on the phone with her for an hour telling her why she shouldn't.  But I can't argue her own reasons for it because it's not my life.  I guess I just wanted to see her with someone who would do anything for her - but she just doesn't want that.  I don't know.  I can't live her life for her and I can't always be right. heh.  So now I live with two of her ex boyfriends who will never be able to get her out of their heads because that's how she is.  You could never forget Shell.  Jimmy's going to start drinking again.  He said he had quit for her and I told him that was dumb.  That he should quit for himself.  "Why?" "Because you have the worst judgement of anyone I know when you drink." He said he'd hand his keys to someone else before he started drinking.  I said sure.  Do I believe him?  Not really.    Why do I always want to become a total recluse when Christmas pops up?   "These precious things.. "  I'm making a present for everyone this year.  I also bought something small for my friends in case they don't like what I made them.  I don't know if they will or not but I hope that they realize it's made with well wishes.  They are taking some time to make.   Did you ever realize you missed listening to Tori Amos?

        You are Form 9,  Vampire : The Undying.   "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."   Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon.  As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth. You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Google returns 'about 6,710' results when "the edge of the deep green sea" is cued.  Everyone loves The Cure.   My finger tips are killing me on my left hand.  I've decided to start playing my guitar again.  I'm actually trying to learn the chords.  I've got E, A, D, Em, Am & Dm down.  Oh and online Tab is generally horrible.  I'd rather go out and buy books of tab.  Ick.  So I was on www.guitarworld.com looking to see if they had free tab displayed (they don't) and I saw that "Fascination Street" was in this month's issue.  I said I wish I had it so CJ went and bought it when he told me he was just going to get cokes.  Sweet but it doesn't help much since Fascination Street has a better bass line than guitar.  Oh well.    It's more of an advanced piece for me anyhow.  I'm not ready for it yet.  I figured that this time I'd learn how to play guitar correctly - or should I say relearn?  Tab's cool and all but I want to play classical.  I want to LEARN my chords instead of relying on fingerings that make hardly any sense.    Other than that we took apart office furniture today.  We're putting up new (old) modular furniture and replacing our handy home made stations.  It'll look much better in our Ops room now but it's taking alot of work.  I'm pretty sore and tired today.  Add in the swelling of my hands from stressing out my carpel tunnel to play acoustic guitar and you can imagine that I don't feel so hot right now.  oh well.  I'm not going to cry about it.   But I am going to end this here.  I type pretty hard and pretty fast so I'm only making my fingers (left hand) worse.

       urlLink eruptor entertainment  made a program called "Little Angel" and she's for the Palm Pilot and whatnot.  Well she says all these cute little things... some are nice... some are mean...and once she said "All Hail Satan.  Dark Lord of the Underworld" and it was really funny.   So a little message comes up when you start it that says "Uh Oh, I've run out of S__t to say!! Visit eruptor.com to download more!"  Yet eruptor.com obviously doesn't really have a website anymore.  Instead they've got a link for "PortaPets Info" but it's not useful either.   Oh well.  Poo.   Happy Tuesday to all.  It's a much better day than yesterday.  Yesterday was shit.  Today may not be shit.  Really no true way to tell until a little later when the rest of my co-workers finally get their asses here.  Really I just want to work from home but I can't.  I need to work all of my shifts and completely work them in order to get money.  Money is very important right now.    Most bill collectors are assholes.  None of them truly realize that they aren't the only account that you are behind on.  They think "wow, this person is just really really in debt with us.  No way did they try to get other credit cards to spread their debt potential."  Well guess what.  I did.  hehehe.  Brilliant me got at least 5 different credit cards/loans and I'm just now starting to pay them off.  It's been 4 years at least.  But I suppose that's not bad compared to some.  My car was paid off this year (October) thank goodness.  I'm currently paying off a computer loan for a pc that I sold a year ago.  I'm paying off my Spiegel card (they are evil).  Oh and I'm paying off my Providian credit card.   That's three!    Now of course JCPenney's is HIGHLY concerned that I haven't made a payment in at least 4 months.  Roger's (CitiBank) is about the same.  Both are threatening me with collections (oohhh I'm so scared!).  Then there's my Aspire card which who knows what they're doing.  I don't think I've received anything from their collection agency.  Strange.  Ah well.    So that's the debt update.  It's getting there.  I pro'ly owe JCPenney $600 by now... I know Roger's is at least $1k...and Aspire is probably that much as well, if not more.    On the weight issue - I lost a pound.  One measley pound.  But it's a pound none the less.  So we wait.  It's only been a day or so really.  This new diet is difficult.  I'm only supposed to have skim milk and I really REALLY love whole milk.  So instead I cut down to 2% and in a couple weeks I'll try going to 1%.  The horror.  Also I'm not supposed to have cheese or meats or anything that isn't good for you really.  It's like... fruit, veggies.... lots of beans... fiber.  It's all about the fiber.  I'm all about eating fat.  Mmmmmmmmmmm fat.  I make soup.  The soup is good.  We'll stick with the soup.  I can have 2 fat meals a week and they have to be moderate.  I'm going to Bennigan's on Friday.  I might actually have a salad.  Might.  No promises.  The fat calls to me.  It's like the Force.   Anywho...I'm sure I should actually get some work done today.

       urlLink The weather  outside was not that cold this morning.  So I thought.  I got in my ice cube, started it up and began to drive down the road.  Mind you I was irritated because my room mate parked his monstrosity (van) behind me and I had to wake him up to move it.  So while I was not late for my normally scheduled shift, I arrived later than I had planned that morning.  Anyways, I pull out of my complex and I'm driving towards the main highway when I figure I can use my washer fluid to clear off my windshield.  Now granted it wasn't horrible and I could definitely see.  It was just not so great and I wanted to be able to see a little *better*.  Low and behold I pull the little trigger and happy spray coats the windshield.  So I watch it suddenly fog up and start to freeze.  I can still see a little but I panic.  I let the wipers keep going thinking that maybe that would break it up and it's not so bad.  So I figure I'll put more fluid on there and it should be so wet that it can't freeze.  WRONG!!!  My entire windshield froze and I drove blind for a good few feet before I realized I couldn't see *anything*.  So I gingerly pulled over, turned on my hazard's and scraped my friggin windshield.  Can you believe that shit?  Froze.  Luckily I was driving before the sun was even up so not too many people were on the road.  Not a single car passed me, I was already embarrassed enough as it were.    So that's my really fucking retarded story for the day.  I think I've filled my moron quota for the year.  YAY!   Diet Update:  The pizza I ate last night was so good.  It was so not on the menu.  I am a fat whore.   On the upside - I bought more fruit this last trip to the grocery store.  Fruit salad and whatnot is definitely on the menu for tonight.  I'm still making my vegetable soup.  Oh, and I have some new recipes to try.  It's just so damn difficult to stick to the diet.  And it's not like it's a diet, it's me switching my eating habits.  But I figure I've already changed them a ton.   I still have that full box (minus 1/2 cup) of Grape Nuts if anyone wants them.  I'll mail it.  I swear that shit was so nasty.  I tried to find recipes that I could use it with but there was nothing that was ok for my diet or ok for me to eat because I'd taste it too much.  Fuckers.   CJ's sick.  I have a meeting with important state clients tomorrow so I've been trying to stay away from him as much as possible.  He stayed home from work today.  Hence why I was trying to get into work early.    Well I have a lot to do.  The Christmas season always makes our fulfillment department quite busier.  Go figure.

      So I tried this  urlLink Vegetarian Chili   recipe and it's actually quite good.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I add 1 red bell pepper and corn to make it a little more colorful and then I add 4 cups of water to make it more soup like.  So with those additions I've renamed it Veggie Chili con carne soup. ^_^  Oh, I also cook it a lot longer than it says to.  I like my veggies to be nice and tender.  Also you should always give things like this time to soak up the flavors.  Oh yeah, one more thing, if you still like the beef taste of normal chili, add in 4 cubes of beef buillon.  I do that because my hubby misses meat.  I myself could care less at this point.  Don't get me wrong, I crave a steak like no other at times, but I'm on a diet.   I haven't been able to write as much as I'd like to.  And when I'd *really* like to write there's either no computer nearby or I'm too lazy to get up and turn it on.  I completed my xmas shopping last week.  CJ completed his on Saturday.  Now I just have to finish making the gifts for my friends and I will be done! woot!  My skin is so dry right now, it's ridiculous.  I itch.  I know that there's nothing I can do.  Lotion doesn't help.  I just have to wait it out.  It's times like these that I really hate being fair-skinned.    I've set myself up to do well on the diet.  Yes I had to start over again today.  Our company cookie party was last week and then I still had crap to finish in the house.  The only thing I haven't finished in the fridge that's iffy is my cottage cheese.  But it's not necessarily on the bad list, just on the "don't eat too much" list.  So I figure that'll be my bad stuff over the holiday or something.  But I made the veggie chili con carne soup last night and tupper'd it all up for the coming week.  I have enough to feed CJ & I for lunch for 4 days.  I made a fruit salad last night for dinner tonight.  And there may be enough there for two nights, not sure yet.  I also have extra fruit in the fridge, enough to make another fruit salad and still have frozen blueberries and frozen strawberries to much on. YUM!  Then I have extra grapes as well and I've brought some of those with me to snack on.  We have two sweet potatoes to eat (if they are still good & I hope they are).  I'm allowed to have 2 bad meals out of the week so for that I have ingredients for Broccoli Cheese soup.  It isn't horrible except for the cheese and the half & half that you add to make it creamy.  I still have ingredients to make minestrone and more basic vegetable soup.  So I'm pretty set for this week.  I'm excited.   Oh, I've started a vitamin regimine.  I'm taking a b12, a multi, and ginko biloba every day.  It's a lot of pills for me, especially when I hate taking anything to begin with but my friend lost a lot of weight and he's taking a lot more.  But I'm trying to get the fat emulcifiers that he's pretty much getting.  He said he's lost 30 pounds.  I'm really proud of him.  He looks good.  Anywho - We bought what we could find at the grocery store and I'll have to go to GNC or something to get Omega3 stuff & Garlic.  I think I've got everything else for the most part.   I only have to work 2 days this week and then I'm not back in the office until Monday.  And then I have New Year's Day off.  That will be nice.  I doubt I'll be hung over like some people I know, but it will still be nice to sleep in.  2004.  Wow.  I still remember "The Millenium" (Said in booming scary voice) and how everyone was so panicked.  Hell, I still remember it turning 1990.  Time goes way too fast, even when you think it's going slow.  There are so many people I've lost touch with.  So many goals I've let drop.  So many dreams I've lost along the way.  It's funny really.  I guess I'm being sentimental - or maybe just crazy.  Not really sure.  I'm afraid to make resolutions for the coming year.  It seems those are always doomed to fail.  But I've changed a bit in the last two months.  Become more determined, or something.  I quit smoking cold turkey.  I've started eating healthier even though I haven't stuck to my diet.  I've started trying to keep our living area a little more cleaner, taken the upperhand in our laundry.  It's all really dumb little things, but it's something.  I've still been really depressed lately - but I'm fighting it.  And then sometimes I'm not, which is different too.  If I feel like going to bed, then I go to bed.  I'm not going to stay up and get irritated and then fight with CJ if I don't have to.   Ah..changes.  Being human sucks.  I'd trade anyday to be a cat.   Meow. ^_^

       urlLink Google  has their cute little art up for 2004.  I love the penguin. ^_^  I've been really bad at writing lately.  I guess I've been busy with the Holiday crap lately.  Not too much has been going on.  I spent New Years rather quietly.  Didn't watch the ball drop, just watched Cartoon Networks thing instead.  Had 2 drinks but didn't get drunk.  Had a few friends over but didn't party. ^_^  Silly, huh?   I didn't even call my mom like normal and scream happily in her ear about the New Year.  Ah well, this year is going to be better.  This is the year for change.  I quit smoking and I can do even more.  All I have to do is set my mind to it and be determined.  I bought AM & PM Yoga and then Pilates conditioning for Weight Loss.  So those are either going to be started this weekend or Monday.  I haven't decided yet.  I've done the Pilates before but never the Yoga so I at least have to watch that one before I do it.  The morning routine will take me 20 minutes and then the evening one will take an hour.  That includes the Yoga.  So I figure it's not so bad.  I can do this.   My New Years Resolutions:   Loose weight (finally)  Become more peaceful Get out more Become a little more organized  That's pretty much it.  Nothing too serious.  But I better get back to work for now.  Hopefully I'll have time to write more before I leave work.

      Another day at work hiding from the asshole that works in my hallway.  Making sure that I'm doing as much work as possible.  Good news, I start technical training today.  A huge responsibility that I'm not 100% sure that I'm ready for but one which everyone assures me I can handle.  They think I'm the little computer wiz.  My boss even comes to me for help with stuff he can't figure out.  It's weird.  I only know what I know from doing it.  It's not like I've ever worked with the platform they are about to train me on.  It's for phone lines and digital switches and whatnot.  So instead of a windows based computer, I have to learn other stuff.  I don't know - it's difficult to explain.  I've built two different computers for myself and one of them I brought into work because theirs really sucked.  But this is another world to me.  At least when we get the system upgraded (by the end of march they tell me) it will be a windows based application instead of some random OS.  That's hard to explain as well.  I'm nervous.

      I found a yoga strap at Target of all places.  It's not even what I went in there for.  Low and behold the big entrance set up is all yoga and pilates stuff.  Those fuckers.  So yay! I have a yoga strap.  So I went ahead and did the PM Yoga and couldn't do all of the exercises.  I'm so not stretchy.  Hopefully that will all change within a few weeks.  Little by little I am sure that I will stretch out.  The AM Yoga I did right after anyways because that was way more relaxing since the stretching is not so extensive.  I can pretty much do all of the exercises in that one with no problem.  I also have Pilates for Weight Loss and I had planned on doing both that and the PM Yoga on the same nights.  I had figured I would do the Pilates first and then the Yoga but now I am not so sure.  Maybe I need to stretch first and then do the exercises?  My hamstrings are so so so so tight.  I have problems doing the last leg exercises in the Pilates work out so the Yoga might be better.  I know, I'm rambling about all this health stuff.  Boy I sure suck.  Anywho.  Time to go.

       urlLink Rodney Yee  is supposed to motivate me in the morning with his Yoga.  All I need is a yoga strap.  So last night I went to the Discovery Store to purchase one since they normally carry Gaiam products.  They had everything but the strap.  Now I feel as though I cannot be enlightened & motivated in the morning.  All because of a Yoga strap.  Damn you cruel world, damn you!

      It seems like I'm constantly trying to dry up my face (oily skin) but yet the rest of me is so dry that I have to apply lotion 20 times a day.  What gives?    Why isn't it enough that I work hard at what I do?  If I don't look like I'm working to other people, then it must not be good enough.  So now I have to not only work hard, but work and looking like I'm working hard.  I hate office politics.  The shit's hittin' the fan, ya know?   I'm concerned about our company where I'm treated like a little kid.  No one will take me seriously it seems, and yet I'm still here?  I still care?  What am I doing?  I'm throwing my life away for something that I don't absolutely love.    I need to become a photographer.  That's what I want to do for the rest of my life.  No more carpal tunnel, no more eye strain from staring at a screen for too long, no more talking to people who don't appreciate an answering service.    *sigh* It's one of those days.

      The last week's been pretty rough.  Maybe things will get fixed now.  Then again, maybe not.  What do I do if it isn't fixed?  I don't know.    I really despise a lot of the people I work with.   Really.  A lot.    Not much else to say for now.

      It is an  urlLink epic adventure.   One that pulls me instinctively into my favorite world.  I feel as if I'm not yet half way through it though it seems as if I am close to the end.  Today I sit in my favorite chair pulled closer to the tele.  My trusted laptop at my side for those tight spots and a drink on the other.  I begin the epic of sitting on my ass for hours on end.  To continue, perhaps end, this saga.

      Redecorating the bedroom in red and black.  That's pretty much it.  Watching lots of cartoons.  Working hard.  Being tracked at work and shit.  It sucks.   More later.

      Ok so really, I'm not usually fond of people.  I have friends and they all pretty much have one thing that drives me nuts but they are still my friends and I still care about them.   One of my ... friends... drives me nuts with her constant drama and prattle so I can normally only take her in small doses... problem comes in with an eating disorder.  I naturally feel compelled to help her and I'm very serious about that.  All I can do is support her and hope that she can get things under control.  It's a little difficult and I am worried about her.    Other than that, Shell is moving in on Sunday night.  She received an externship at Sibley Hospital in DC for the summer.  I'm very excited! Only bad part will be her moving out at the end and going back to York, PA for school. :(  These things do happen tho and I'm very happy that she's following her dreams.   Not much else has been going on.  At work we're getting ready for a MAJOR upgrade so I've been pretty busy with that.  Normally I haven't had time to sit down and post anything but I figured what the hell.  Why not give myself a few minutes to sit down and type this out.  It's been a long time, I know.   Anywho...I took The Skinny Saga off my profile list because I haven't been following my diet strictly and just haven't had time to post what I've been eatingn daily.  I did add my apple this morning but that's the first since February.  How time flies.   We bought a grill - definately a downfall for my diet...but anything grilled tastes excellent.  I'll just have to find something that's relatively healthy.  Maybe CJ will by me some tofu dogs or something.  I like tofu in chinese food but I'm not sure how a tofu dog would be.  Could be absolutely disgusting... I guess we'll find out?  I had asparagus for the first time last weekend.  It was pretty good to begin with and then by the end of the serving it was just too overpowering for me.  Too mushy...? Not really sure.  Oh well.  Maybe if it were a little more crunchy I could stand it.  I'll have to try it again.   Oh and I'm growing things!  I have three thirty inch planter boxes that have purple irises growing and then I have little individual pots for herbs.  Those herbs are: Peppermint, Rosemary, 2 Lavender, Spearmint, Lemon Balm, Basil & Camomile.  Unfortunately I have to wait for most of them to bud before I can harvest the leaves... the only thing that I don't have to wait on is the Rosemary, Lemon Balm, Basil and maybe the Spearmint - not 100% sure about that one though.    Anywho... I better go now.  I have software to install and PC's to clean, etc.  Ciao ^_^

      Mikey & Janet's party at my house is tonight.  What was I thinking?  So much to do so little time.  Cj's got a bad tooth ache and has to go see Dr Bacchus today.  Luckily this one's on the house which was so sweet of him.  I have to go get my license today or at least a photo ID so I can get into Nottingham's tomorrow for Matt's birthday party.  Oh and I have to go out, drink, have a good time and then sleep and get right back up and go to Bob & Jean's to help w/some work they are doing on their house.  whew.    I'd like an alternate life right now.... where is that other universe with me in it?  It's gotta be better than this.... grass is always greener....

      Just returned from a four day weekend.  It was nice.  I didn't relax too much but I got a lot done.  One day I'll take a real vacation and not do anything. :)  Um a lot has been happening with work and what not and I've been pretty busy.    This Friday I have a going away party for Janet & Mikey and then Saturday is Matt's birthday thing.  Luckily I only have to plan dinner for Friday night and then we're going to Tony Roma's.  Saturday I have nothing to do with except that I HAVE to show up. :)  The D&D Campaign we're playing in should be starting soon.  Within the next two weekends I would say.    Other than that... not too much to tell.  Will try to post more soon.

           Ok, so I forgot that I even had a blog (or 5) until someone posted a comment yesterday one my last post.... very strange.&nbsp; Life has been so incredibly busy.&nbsp; With the upgrade at work and the house.&nbsp; Oh yeah, CJ & I are trying to buy a house.&nbsp; If you've never bought a house before here are some tips:   1. If your credit is shady and delinquent be prepared to get a letter from every creditor stating that the account is in settlement or has been paid off.   2.&nbsp; Keep your paystubs.  3. Keep your W-2's from the last two years (I know you should be anyhow, but I can only find last years).   4. Paperwork takes a LONG time.&nbsp; Be prepared to sign the loan application in about 10 places.&nbsp; They tell me I'll be signing during settlement for about an hour or so and that the stack of paperwork is about three inches high.   5. Just because one lender turns you down, doesn't mean they all will.&nbsp; Go through a company that deals with multiple lenders - they will work with you for the most part.&nbsp;   6. Don't get your hopes up the first time you apply.&nbsp; Don't want to die the first time you get turned down.&nbsp; It is the worst roller coaster ever.   That's about it for my advice so far.&nbsp; I'm sure there will be more to come as we continue to go through this.&nbsp; CJ is handeling most of the details but it's my credit that has the worst items on it.&nbsp; So I've had to call every creditor and beg for them to send me something that says I've paid the account off or I'm working on it.&nbsp; Let me tell you what, if you are trying to get paperwork from a creditor in a hurry, most of them will NOT fax it.&nbsp; Makes no sense to me.&nbsp; You would think their computer systems would at least send the fax so that they wouldn't kill anymore trees.&nbsp; That's not the case.&nbsp; They want to mail it and make you wait.&nbsp; Most say they will mail it within so many hours, most are liars OR the post office is extremely slow just because it's something you need in a hurry.&nbsp; I'm not sure which yet but it's nicer to blame the creditors.&nbsp; I did luckily have two companies willing to fax things over (thought I have not yet received one of them). Kudos to them.   What else is going on.&nbsp; Oh so Sarah came back to visit and she got her nipples pierced.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;I'm a little jealous since CJ & I are the piercing rulers here at work and I don't think I could bring myself to pierce mine.&nbsp; I mean, they'd have to be done at once and I'd have to probably be restrained so I didn't hit someone.&nbsp; All of my other piercings have gone relatively well as far as the pain department and my tattoos didn't hurt very much at all - but the nipples.&nbsp; I think that's a bit much to ask of me.&nbsp; I imagine that the pain is like that a man experiences with a boot connects with his nether regions.&nbsp; Maybe I'm blowing this totally out of proportion - CJ was man enough to get a frenum....but do I really want them pierced?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; I won't go so far as to say she's cooler than me because of it. ;)&nbsp; Kidding - but I was surprised.&nbsp;   On to other things.... Speaking of things happening that are weird - my mother got a tattoo.&nbsp; Now she's only 44 and acts as though she's in her late 20's (coolest mom ever) but even though she says that she never gave me shit about mine, I seem to recall she did.&nbsp; You know, the normal comments about how they'll be gross when you're 80 and what not.&nbsp; She has not yet sent me a picture but when she does I'll be sure to post it.&nbsp; I'm eagerly waiting for it.&nbsp; She may be waiting for it to heal before she takes one though so it could be a little bit.&nbsp;   I think that's it for now... I hadn't posted in a while but this was a long one.&nbsp; I'll try to update more frequently.&nbsp; If I forget you can always post me a comment and I'll see it.   Remember the rule of 3.   &nbsp;

           I haven't forgotten about posting the dream - I just haven't had a lot of time.&nbsp; Everyone should go read  urlLink http://sinfest.net  today.&nbsp;   The house buying saga continues....We're sending back our loan paperwork today and then we have to wait for them to send it to the underwriters, schedule an appraisal on the house and send the paperwork to the title company.&nbsp; Then we have to wait for the appraisal to come back, our loan paperwork to be approved and the title company to make the appointment for closing.&nbsp;   Whee fun.   I think I'm going to go eat my banana before I think about the house thing more and make myself sick.   Ciao! ^_^
