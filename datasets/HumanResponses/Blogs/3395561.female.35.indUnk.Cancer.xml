      I am so lonely today.  I have been crying allot.  I do not know what to do.  I should of went out today but could not.  I did not feel safe too.  I just want to be with my Man, I miss Him so much.    Why do I feel like this?  I tried posting in a group but I was posting to much they said, I was just trying to make friends but I ruin that like I always do.  I am not going to say much in that group anymore.  I was just lonely and when I get this way I need to talk to someone.  I do not have any one that I can talk to during the day.    I know that I will lose my Man when he gets back.  I just know it.  Then I do not know if I can take that.  I hurt so bad some days I can not take things like I used to.    I want to be with him so much.  I know I can not be.  I have offers to move to Kansas and California, but do not know yet.  I will have to see what is going on next week.  That will tell me everything.    I was told that I am a smart woman.  I do not think I am.  And that men might be afraid of me.  Maybe that is it.  I do not know.  I know who and what I am and I can not hide it anymore.  I want this so bad it hurts but no one understands.  I feel like I am the only one that feels this way.    toy

      I keep on pushing myself to get better.  There are days that I can not.  I turn to anyone that will listen to me anymore.  I am crying out for help.  It just seems like the people I want to help me can not.  And the people that can help I do not want them to help me.  I must figure this out on my own.    I want to be with my Man, but I do not think it will last much longer.  We do not chat as we used too.  I have not seen him over a year now. It is very hard on me because I love him allot.  But I do understand that if it does not work out.  I have a man that wants me out in California.  I do not know what to do with this one.  I am scared.  I have told him all of this and he stills is here.  I guess he really likes me.  Do I have the same feelings for him?  I do not know.  Friendship yes I do but for the "L" word (love) I do not.  I just want to take my time with and see where it leads too.  I did have a man here in CC, TX.  But we were moving to fast and we both ended the sexuall part of the relationship.  We are good friends and will always be that.    I do live with a man that I did love at one time.  That love is gone now and I can not go back to that.  He took that away.  I can not deal with him anymore either.  He wants to become a woman 24/7 and I can not be apart of that.  Plus he is in love with a Man that is going to be moving down here this summer.  I have to be gone by then.    I need a job but all the jobs here will not be able to make enough to pay the bills so I can live on my own.  I would be working my ass off and not making it.  I just hope my Man still wants me and that he has a place for me.  If not I do not know where I will be at the end of the summer.    toy

      I just do not have much to say today.  Went to the North Beach here in CC, TX with my roommate Jeff and my dog Elmo.  Walked to one wall to the other wall.  That is a long walk but good exercise.  I am working on my tan as well.    Later after we got home and relaxed some.  We got into because I have some figures written down a peice of paper.  Those figures are from when I figured up his paycheck and how much we would have.  He thought it was a phone number to someone near Dallas, TX.  I tried to show him and he still did not believe me.  I told him to call the damn number because I did not know who in the hell it was too.  It was just numbers that I had written down so I could figure out his pay check.  I tried showing him that on one peice of paper that I figure out bills for next pay check.  I am going to go now.  I hope things will get better for me real soon.    toy

      This is getting old.  I only sleep an hour and a half then wake up jittery.. I hate that feeling.  I can not go back to sleep either.  Not for another 3 hours.  Then I sleep until about 9-10 am, I know my sleeping pattern is off.  I know why too.  This is why.  My relationship with my Man.  I love my Man.  I do ask myself if I do love Him or is it something else.  Or is the other Man the one.  I do not know anymore.  I just wish that my Man wants to talk to me more.  I miss those chat.  I just feel like our relationship is on the rock and I do not know what else to do.  I ask myself does my Man have the same feelings as I do for Him.  He is not back yet.  He might get back today.  I wish He was back already.  I wish He would come to me and take me.  If we are still together then I need ask permission to go to Kansas to visit some of my friends and out in California as well.  All of my friends are going to help me out with everything so I do not have to worry about it all.  I am going to go now and try to think things through and I hope to get some more sleep.  I miss and love my Man, and my sons.    toy

      I got up about 9 or 10 am.  I gave Elmo my 3 yr old pit bull a bath today....lol.  He hates it, but he needed it....lol.  Then after that I change into a biniki top and shorts and started housework.  I can not keep up.  Picked up all the laundry and started on it.  Cleaned out the wash room.  It was a mess.  Then I did dishes and washed the shells I found at the beach.  I put the shell on a paper towel and let them dry.  I went in the dinning area to get a small seedless watermelon to put in the frig.  Guess what?  The frig gave out it must of happen last night.  I throw away about $40 worth of food and cooked up the rest.  I called the landlord about it.  Three to four hours later he calls and told me that he would get it taken care of.  I am going to get my money back with all the food that I had to cook up.  I have to cook the rest tomorrow because it was in the middle of a stack and did not thraw out.  Thank god for that.  I had to cook up all the hot dogs, sausages, a pack of patio steaks, and a pack of thighs.  Now my kitchen is a mess again after I spent some time cleaning it before all of that.  I got what I could save in 2 coolers.  I just hope I get a frig tomorrow.  Just been to busy to think today which is really good.  I am still doing laundry but will finish it up later.  Did get some pics took and developed today, cropped them, and posted them to my yahoo profile albums.  Boy, I am glad it is all over with for now.  Until I get up later in the morning and it starts over again.  I better go to bed in about 10 minutes.  Good night and sweet dreams.  toy

      This really hard to say sometimes.  I do get very lonely in what I seek.  I do not know if my Man thinks I know what is going on in my head.  I do.  My Man, has not promised me anything, has not told me that He is a certain type of Man, He has not put no one down in front of me, He respects me, listens to me, gives me spaces, gives me time to figure things out, and the list goes on and on.  That is why I love Him and I have been running all that in my head.  But on the other hand I have been running all the bad things as well, like He does not answer all of my emails or, He does not answer all of my questions that I ask, and things like that.  I have to weigh it all out and figure what I am going to do.  I want to be with my Man almost 24/7 now.  All I can say that He has captured my heart from day one.  I can not turn back from that.  If He does not want me anymore then I do understand then I will move on, but it will be awhile before I will find another Man.  I know I have the one out in California, but to me He is pushing me to fast that what really scares me, I do not like to be pushed that fast.    I am just wondering if my Man is scared of me because I know what I am now.  I mean the level I am at now.  I am at a level that does scare me now.  I want His input on everything now.  I want to know where W/we are at in this relationship.  I do not know anymore.  I feel like W/we are falling apart.  I miss Him dearly.  I hope He reads all of theses and understands them all.    toy

      I want You to know that I love You.  I know I have not been the best girl lately.  I have been a pain in the ass.  I have allot of issue now allot more now then I did before.  If You are truly fond of me then tell me more often.  A girl will do better when You tell her this.    I have talked to the other man.  I told him that You are going to move me to Louisiana this summer.  He understood.  I can not ask to be release that is the last thing I want now.  The natural slave is coming out more then before and I need everything that You can give me and teach me.  Please understand it more.  There is more to this lifestyle then being a thing.  I just want to hear from You that You miss me or care for me or fond of me.  You have not told me in a while.  That hurts so much.  I cry almost daily.     Do You know why I have turn to this lifestyle?  I want to hear it from You.  We lost our communitation lets get it back.  Talk to me.  You would be surprise what I can tell You.  Ask me questions I will answer them the best I can.  Just understand me, that is all I ask of You.    toy

      The other man now told me finally earlier that he wants to own me and love me. To soon for that.  I can not deal with that right now.  I was shocked when he told me all of this.  I will be honest I did not think I impressed him that much.  I started to cry when he got really serious.  I was thinking I can not let go of my Man, I have worked to hard for this.  If I do get go and it does not work out then I will be all alone and I can not be alone anymore.    Is this the way my Man felt the first time I told him I loved him?  Did he freak out? What did he feel when I told him all that?  I remember telling him I was falling in love with him and that I wanted to have a locking collar where he would have the key.  To think about it now.  I was pushing it to fast.     He let me go because I was rude.  My roommate was hounded me for months to ask my Man to take me back.  I gave in one day and told my Man that my roommate has been hounding me to ask you to take me back, because when I am with you I am much happier.  I was shocked to find out that he wanted me back.  He took me on. I have been with him since then.  I wish we could live togather but I know that will never happen.  I do not know if he would want me anymore after he reads all of this.  I will find out when he gets back on line.  When I read the email he will leave me or an off line message.  I am going now.  toy

      I do not know what to do?  I love my Man.  I worked to hard to keep this going.  I can not throw it away.  Over the year that we have not seen each other was and still is very hard to deal with for me.  I do not know how the people deal with this when their love ones are in the services.  I can not.  I do not know if it is me or what?  I just wish my Man would talk to me about these things.  I have been trying to tell him that.  I ask him questions and most of the times he does not answer them.  I just wish he would.  I just want to talk to him about all of this.  I do not want him to think that my head is not screwed on right.  Because it is.  I am at a different level now and I can not go down a level.  I keep on getting on a new level and I can not go back.    My Man wants me to be with other men.  I can not do that anymore.  It is really hard to do anymore.  They do not care about aftercare or anything else.  I am just a peice of meat to them.  I am nothing to them.  I need aftercare so bad lately that I feel so dirty, worthless, no one cares, cheap, and the list goes on and on.  I want to be with Him.  If he really wants me to be with other men then let me do it in his present so he can protect and care for me.  I need him to punish me in real. I just need him allot lately and he has not been here for me. I am so confused anymore.  toy

      I am finding myself waiting at the pc for someone.  I do not know why either.  Is it because he will listen to me and truly understand what I am going through with my Man?  My Man owns me all the way.  I can not go against that.  I can talk to other Men that are into the lifestyle that I am in and They can not reach inside of me like my Man and the other one.  Which one do I choice?  My Man gives me space, respects me, and listen to me.  Now on the other hand so does the other man.  I was talking to the other man on the phone last night.  He told me that he wants to own me and mark me.  I was like wow.  I have a Owner already and he told me this.  I must be someone special.  If I have another man that wants to own me.  All I know is the lifestyle that I have become to respect.  It comes natural to me anymore.  I think I was born this way.  There is not allot like me, only a few us around.  I know it is in my soul, mind, heart, body, and spirit.  My Man told me that I do not have any limits beside the common that allot do have, but there are limits that allot do not understand.  When I was on the phone last night the other man told me that he would not cut off my arms, I said jokingly, oh then you would cut off my legs....lol.  He just laughed at me.  What do I do about all of this?  Is my Man going to keep me to himself or is he going to let me go?  Right now I do not know.  I will have to see what my Man does with our relationship when he gets back on line.    toy

      I can not always talk to someO/one about the lifestyle I live.  A/allot do not understand it and thinks it is a tabboo.  If it is done right it is a very beautiful thing and awesome.  Once Y/you find the right P/person to share it with it can be very rewarding.  That is why I am confused.  I am owned already.  Am I happy right now with the relationship?  I do not know.  Is He happy with me?  I do not know.  I am in this space that is very scary.  It is hard to explain it all.  I am at the point that I am lost and confused.  I know what I need anymore.  I need to have allot of control in my life NOW.  There is not enough.  I NEED more.  But on the other hand I know that He has needs also.  So it goes both ways.  I think W/we are at a point of O/our lives that W/we do not know what to do.  Maybe I am wrong.  I do not know.  I do not know how much more of the online relationship part I can handle.  It is not cutting it.  I cry allot because I am at a level of this lifestyle that needs allot right now.  It is not the wants anymore it is the needs now, that are coming forward and that hurts allot.    I had a session one day with a Guy, He told me that I did good.  To me I did not, because I was in a sub drop.  That is when I sub bottoms out.  There was no aftercare after all the play.  I NEED that so much lately.  I am not getting ANY and it hurts.  I cried and cried and cried.  Then I finally figure out that I was having the drops and then when I try to talk to someO/one about it T/they do not understand it.  The O/ones that I know T/they know about this lifestyle I do talk to about it and T/they do understand because T/they know what it is like.  A/allot do not understand the lifestyle.  I wish more would.  I think it would make the world a better place.    toy

      I do not know what to do.  I have one Man in my life that I love dearly then on the other hand I have another Man out in California that wants me.  I am so confused right now.  Mike is in Louisiana and we have been together for over a year now and known each other for 2 years now.  Dave is out in California and we started to chat about a week ago.  I have allot of thinking to do.  One I can live with and the other I will have my own place and he will visit me when he can.  Where do I want to live?  Dave wants me to come out to visit him.  I would like to go and visit.  Then I will have to come back.  I do not know if I want to live out in California.  Dave wants to do a photo shoot.  I would love that.  I know I can not have both.  I can have only one that can own my heart, my body, my soul, and my mind.  Right now I do not know where my relationship is with Mike.  I will find out when he gets back in town.  I know I have not did the things that he wanted me too, because I have needs and I feel that they are not getting met at all now.  I finally know who I am and what I have became.  I love that feeling.  I am damn proud of it as well.  But when my needs are not filled I am totally lost and confused.  I can not do the things that Mike wants me to do.  I need allot lately.  I can not keep on dating men like I have been.  I have needs after we finish the date and no one has met them yet.  I am not a thing and sometimes I feel like it and no one understand that.  It hurts allot and I can not get over that feeling.  I am trying to figure out what should I do.  I know one can offer me more then the other.  Do I want that?  I do not know.  I just hope that the both of them just understands that I can not make a decision right now or anytime soon.    toy

      It really sucks that I have no one to be with tonight.  It is just another lonely night as always.  I miss being with my Man.  I did had another relationship with someone here, but we both decided to call it off.  It was for the best.  But we are remaining friends which is really good.  I miss him allot as I miss my Man.  I wishing I was with Him now.    toy

      I have been chatting with another Man that is into the alt. lifestyle.  He is very helpful and helped me to understand what I feel inside of me.  He was right about everything in my life as for now.  It is so nice to chat with him and he understand everything I am telling him.  I am feeling allot better now.  Now I know what is bothing me and so on.  Before I did not know it.  I have alway had wants in my life, but they have become needs now.  I am finally accepting who I am as well.  There for a long time I was not.  Now I am proud of what I have became and I know it will get better.    toy

      I just feel lonely allot lately.  My Man is in Louisiana.  I miss Him dearly.  We have not seen each other over a year.  We keep in touch through emails, chat, cam, and phone.  It is not the same as a real touch and so on.  I have a male roommate.  We were lovers at one time.  Not anymore.  He has a Man in his life also.  Yes, I said a Man in his life.  Not the same Man that I have.  I have been through allot and just do not know if I can handle much more.  I do not know how I surive all of this.  I keep on pushing myself to do better.  I am getting to the point that I can not do that anymore.  I better go before I began to cry again.    toy

      I have to much on my mind lately.  I am so lonely as well.  I just wish I could find someone that could love me back and treat me good.  With all the men I have been dating I only found one that made me feel special but to find out he has a girl friend.  We are still friends but it just hurt so much.  I do not understand why men have to lie and tell me that they are single and then find out that they have someone in their lives.  I have been under so much stress in my life.  I think I am going crazy.  I know I am not but just feels like it.  That is enough for now.    toy

      I am something else.  I get my ass in more trouble then anyone I know....lol.  Oh well, that is my life.  I just wish people were not so closed, they should be open and have fun.    I have learned allot lately.  It does not matter what I look like or what I do or who I am.  All that matter is that I take pride in myself.  I have.  I have really short hair that I really like now.  Working on getting white, I know I said white.  Right now I have it blonde and spiked on top.  It is really cute.  I really love it.  At first I did not but now I do.    I have posted something in a couple of groups and in my blog and it got back to the people.  I am really sorry it did but I did not mention any names and no one would known who it was unless they were apart of the group.  I think I have an idea who it was.  I left her group because no one would post hardly anything in the group.  She might be upset with me but do I care no I do not.  I am trying to find out if there was any names mentioned and if so that person was lieing big time and made me look really bad.  I just wished people would grow up and stop acting like children.  I am not going to be posting anything in the groups that I do on the side. Because I am tired of all the BS on line.  I do not care what people think of me or what they say about me.  I just hope that have enough courage to tell me in a email or in messenger or in real.  But I have not gotten anything back yet.  So I do not know.    Before I forget, my Man told me He is my loving Master.  I think that is so sweet of Him and that He misses chatting with me and not be able to see me.  That really makes me feel good.    Well, I need to get my ass in bed.  Good night and Sweet or Sadistic Dreams.  toy

      I do not know why people put up with me.  I am a screw up and I can not even get my submission right.  I was remind I did something wrong and I was wrong.  I made a post on June 13th and I was in the wrong.  So I made another post so people would know that I am truly sorry.  Here it is:  I made a post on the June 13 and I was in the wrong.  I want to apologzy to everyone that I have offended.  I was happy to just go out and have fun for the day and a night without my roommate Jeff in 4 years.  I know better.  When I see the people next (who I talked about the party that night) they can punish me.  It is only right.  I want to say sorry and if I do it again please let me know.  Email me please and tell me.  Thank you.  By the way, I will not be on line for awhile.    toy  I posted that in the groups that I talked about.    I keep screwing up and screwing up.  I feel so stupid sometimes that I can not think right.  I do not know what to do anymore.  Maybe I should take a break from things.  My Man wants me to move to Louisianna but I keep on screwing up.  I doubt I will I keep fucking up.    Maybe I should just forget about the lifestyle for awhile and do nothing.  Only thing I think I am good at.  I guess I am wrong.  My Man told me that I am not acting like a submissive anymore.  I fucked up big time.    I am being punished now for it.  Will not go into details of it.  Well, I am going to take a bath, watch TV, and cry myself to sleep tonight.  It is the only thing I can do right or is it.  toy

      Some b-day, I am sick again.  I am getting tired of getting UTI again.  I do not know what is wrong with me either.  At least I caught it early enough so I can get it treated and it will not effect me too much.  I can not stay on long just enough to post.    I am going to see how many people can remember my B-day without anyone reminding them at all.  I do not think my Man will remember.  He does not even send me a card like I send Him.  I do not think my roommate remember.  I am not worried about it.  I am only 35 years young and still alive and kicking.  My Man has not answer my question yet.  I wish He would.  That is going to decide where I am going to live the end of the summer and where I will be working at also.    I have another Dom interested in me again.  I am getting them crawling out of the wood work.  This one wants to own me as well.  I do not think it would work out anyways, because it is my roommate's Master and I do not like sharing my Man with another Man.  Well, I am not feeling well and I need to get my ass back to bed now.  Good night and Sweet or Sadistic Dreams.  toy

      I do not know where to begin at.  I have allot of things to work out with my Man.  Sometimes I just wish that He would see what I am saying.  But I guess not.  That is alright, I guess.  I had and have screwed up so much lately that I do not know what to do lately.    I am still getting offers from other Men.  I do not tell them nothing and I blow them off.  Because I do not know where I am at with my Man.  I have allot to do lately and I do not have much time for Him.  I told Him how I felt and I guess that was wrong to do.  I was just being open and honest and I get my ass jumped.  I guess I am not supposed to think I guess or have any feelings.  I do not know any more.  I just been thinking allot that is all and it is getting me introuble with allot.  I do not have much to say or I might get in trouble for that too.  I am going to see what happens next.

      I really did it this time.  My Man told me that I was treating Him like my roommate.  He is right I was and did not see it.  I have became a selfish little girl.  I have lost respect in my life again.  I had done this before serveral times and it is not fun.  I can not think right now.  I emailed my Man and I hope that I do not screw it up again.  I am going to bed now.  Good night and Sweet or Sadistic Dreams  toy

      I had an awesome Saturday.  I am glad I did it.  I went to a BBQ during the afternoon.  I had to take the bus and it took 2 hours to get there but it is only a 20 minute drive....lol.  And had a blast.  I just hated to leave when I did because it took me 2 hours to get back home to be able to get ready for the next party I went too.  About the party it was a different type of party that I am used too. I am so used to Houston's BDSM parties. They are a blast up there. If anyone wants to go to one in Houston, let me know and I will find out when the next Eros party is and I will see if we can get an invite. Down here everyone was tame. There was only 4 females, which were all submissives, 5 men and 4 of them were Dominant and the other one was submissive. The only 2 women that was naked that I did see. Was me and the hostress, but I was doing a scene with the male subbie. The scene was a game theme with a twist. I was supposed to keep the man hard that was my part by sitting on his cock I was not suppose to move but I moved...lol, then his part was trying to keep soft, that was hard for him....lol. They would come and check to see if he was hard and if he was he got 3 swats on the ass for each time. If he went soft I got the 3 swats on my ass. Guess who won????? LOL I only got 6 swats, smiles, and he got 9. The only reason that I got the 6 was because I was doing everything I could think of to keep him hard, and I was talking dirty....lol. Then I got up and open my eyes and I busted out laughing so hard. He had put his fingers in his ears and I could not help myself...lol. The other time I could not remember why he got soft. But I took my licks and wanted more.  They did not play me that hard because of the other people. There are more like vanilla and acting like they just started the lifestyle. I am not used to a tame party like that and sorry no pics. Maybe next time. After the game, I sat around nude and I was the only person that would do that. I think I freaked out the women there. I was not ashamed to show my body and they did not like then can kiss my ass....lol.  Oh got to tell everyone this, the ones that know about me and my roommate will understand this. On my way back home he called and started crap with me like always, I told him not to get on my case, he told me that he was not on my case, and then I just shut up and pretend that he was not there. Plus he got off earlier then I thought and I was like oh shit. I was ready to go. I was hot....lol. So I was watching for my ride to show up and when he did I was out the door and whisper to him "lets go he is home earlier then I thought" he nodded and we left. When I got back home about 3:30-4 am roommate came in my room and kissing my ass like always. Because he knows that he was wrong to do that.  I know I copy and paste, I cheated.  But I am wore out little girl.  But a happy one....Smiles.  Well, I am going to go now and get things done today that I need to do yesterday but was having to much fun....lol.  toy

      Why me, why do I get so hung up on a Man that I can not be with 24/7?  Can anyone answer that?  Maybe because I love Him or maybe because He makes me feel wanted.  I do not know.  I have been trying to work things out with my Man and I do not know if I am getting anywhere with Him.   I hope He understand the email I have left Him.    I just feel like He does not understand me sometimes.  I wish He did it would make a world of difference.  I keep asking myself why me?  Why does He keep me.  I have not been the good girl lately and I do not plan on being any better anytime soon.    I have one thought in my head that keeps going around and around.  My Man told me that I needed to start acting like a slave.  Well, if that the case then my Man needs to start acting and taking responablity of His property.  He is the one that need to punish me, make sure I am well taken care of, keep me in line, make sure the punishment are done right, and more.  He knows what needs to be done.  As I do as a slave, but I feel like He does not know I know that.  I really do.  I just hope He reads this and understands me more.  I better get my ass in bed it is a little after 2:30 am.  Good night and Sweet or Sadistic Dreams.    toy

      I have to think on what I am going to do now.  I am tired of being pushed allot anymore.  I know I need it allot.  On the other hand I need some good old fashion TLC, but my Man does not see it.  Maybe He does and does not know how to handle it all.  I do not know how His home life is.  I just wish He would open up with me.  I love Him but I know He can not love me back like the way I wanted.  I just think He is taken out His problem at home on me and I just can not handle them.  I really think He was jealous of another man.  I liked it.  It showed me that He does care for me in one way or another.  I just want Him to tell me things and answer my questions.  That is not so hard.  What is so hard to do.  I want to know that.  I wish He could tell everything.  I am tired of Him hiding things from me, I can feel it.  I just wish that He can open up to me like I have with Him.    I do not know if I really can handle it anymore.  I am trying to.  I am trying to understand all of this.  I know what I am now I am happy with it.  I am tired of being like this with my Man not touching me.  All I want right now is to be at His feet.  I have an offer to live in Houston now.  He might not approve of it.  Since I have a so called bad girl.  I only do it because I am not getting the attention that I need.  He does not understand at all.    This are my thoughts and feelings and I guess they do not mean nothing to Him.  I wish they did.  I have learned to respect this lifestyle because if you do not know anything about it and it will turn around and bite you in the ass.  I am tired of men that think I am stupid because I am not.  If I want to be treated like that I will plan on staying with my roommate now.  I do not want to.  I want to move on and live my life.  How can I without that kind of control that I need from a man?    I think sometime my Man thinks He can push me around and now that I will made a stand. It pisses Him off.  I am sorry, but I can not let Him do that with me.  That is something He has taught me with my roommate.  He does not see that.  I know one things if we do not improve we will fall apart.  I know that for a fact.  I have been honest with Him and I just wish that He would be also.  I know He has not, I can tell.  He does not know I can tell either.  It is just when I ask Him questions and He does not answers them.  To be honest I do not think I will be moving to Louisiana, if I am I will be shocked.  He said He will work on it but I am not going to count on it.  He has told me allots of time He was going to do things like call me, or come and get me and did not show up or call me or even leave me a off line message or even email me at that time.  The only time He has called is when He said that He was going to call me right away.  Do not get me wrong He is a good Man, but He has to come clean and be honest about allot of thing to himself.  He thinks sometimes I need my head screwed on but I do not anymore.    So I have to figure out what I am going to do about all of this.  Do I stay with Him and work it out?  Or do I leave Him and take time away from the Lifestyle and figure out my life?  I do not know.  I have to do this on my own.    toy

      I have not written in my journal for about 6 days now.  That is to long not to write. I am not going to move to California now.  Well, he does not want to talk to me now because he has a guilty mind.  That does not bother me.  I understand.  It is all because I am owned.  I think I am working things out with my Man as well.  We have allot of talking still to do.  I think we need to open up more.  I am trying on my end just getting Him to open up some.  He is like a closed book, I think I have Him figure out and it changes.  I trust Him allot with my feelings and everything.  There are times I do stand up to Him.  I have too.  If I do not then I feel like He will walk all over me and I will not let that happen.  I think sometimes He is pushing me to see if I will stand up to Him.  We both test each other all the time.    I got an email from my Man, I think this is so cute.  I think He was jealous of someone else interested in me and wanted to own me.  That tells me allot.  I can say allot about my Man that allot will not approve of because of the lifestyle that we live in.  You have to know about the lifestyle that we live in and understand it allot.  He is hard on me, but then I do things so I can be punish by Him.  This way I know that He cares about me.  I hate disobeying Him but sometimes that is the only way I get any attention from Him.    Before I go I got an weird phone call a little after midnight.  I do not answer my phone if I do not have the number in it, so I let it go to voice mail and I could barely hear the person.  I am going to do a search on the number.  I could make out the word "bitch" allot but not the other words I have to listen to it some more.  Well, I better get my ass in bed now, I have a busy day before Saturday.    toy

      Boy, my life does not get that easy.  I have allot on my mind.  I am doing good about my depression and keeping it under control.  I have to deal with it and not let it control me at all.  I have been letting it control me.  I can not do that any more.  I will not get well.  I will become sicker.    About the Men in my life.  That is a whole another story in my life.  I have to deal with them as they come to me and I am going to handle it the best way I can.    Well, I have to write something in my journal this morning and I did.  Now get my ass in bed and get some sleep.  Good night and sweet dreams.  toy

      There is to much going on here in my mind.  There is allot that I can not answer either, but I will have to find the answer one way or another.  I am owned by one Man, but then another Man wants to own me as well.  I do not know what to do.  I do not really want to live out in California.  I know if I ask for a release I will not probably get it.  So I am stuck.  I do not know what to do if I am not release.  I do not know if I can take another collar.  I can not take one right off the bat.  I will have time to heal and move on.  I have not heard from my Man yet about all of this.  I was hoping that W/we could chat about it.  I hope He will be on line soon.  I know what He will say to me.  You are release and I am not going to fight it.  I can not fight it anymore.  I have to stand up for myself anymore if I do not then I am nothing. I can not deal with that.  I understand if I am released as well.  I think it might be the best thing.  I do not know either.  I have to go to bed I can not think right anymore and write either.  toy

      What else can go wrong in my life right now???? I can not find a job that my life depended on it. I am not able for food stamps any more less I can get a job and work it for a month then I can reapply. My roommate is suspended for a long time. In other words he is fired. They told him to check about his job Monday to see if he still have it. I doubt it. I have been very sick during the week and finally getting back on my feet. I have allot of things to get done and I do not know if I can do it all. The house work has not been done while I was sick. I am still sick. I have to get caught up in it. I do not need all of this right now. I can not afford to go to the doctors now I have to count every penny that we have until I can get two jobs.  My life really sucks right now. I just want to runaway from everything and say screw it all. What would that solve???? Nothing!!!! I have to think things through and see what I am going to do and how to handle it all. I think I am doing alright. I have to stay up all night and make sure my roommate does not do anything stupid. Like killing himself. I am not going to get any sleep and being sick still not good. I need my rest. I know I should not take care of him like that because he does not take care of me when I am sick. I have to and want to. He is letting me stay here with no job and supporting me, so I have to repay it all back by doing the all.  I am going now. I have to get back looking for jobs again. I have to look no matter how I feel. Even if I am hurting and in tears it does not matter anymore. I have to have work or money coming in one way or the other.  huggles and kisses good night and sweet and Sadistic Dreams toy
