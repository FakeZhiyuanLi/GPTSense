      Hrm. I've decided to up mu calorie intake, upping the amount of excersize I do too. So far, today I've eaten 365 calories. A rather large number, yes, but I think I'm going to&nbsp;go for&nbsp;somewhere around 500. I've worked out that I burned around&nbsp;300, cycling, and more when Ironing and cleaning. I believe 500 would be suitable. Will edit later.

      It's been a good day today, foodwise.  Today, I've eaten a nectarine, a slice of melon and a weight watchers youghurt.&nbsp; This comes to a total of168 calories. I was also walking around town today, but for not as long as yesterday. Whole in town, I bought some kelp pills. I read that they're supposed to increase your metablolic rate, so you burn food faster.. and when there's no food, there's fat to burn!  I'm going to find myself a list of negative caolrie foods, so I can eat them and not feel so bad.  I've also decided to weigh myself in the mornings, as this will allow me to adjust what I eat accordingly. I was quite pleased when I jumped on the scales this morning, as I'd lost about one and a half kilograms. This really gave me some motivation.  I'm going to sort out about the gym later tonight with Kayte. I'm guessing I'll spend as long as I can there this holiday, not forgetting the swimming pool.  I think I might go and dig out my bike, and have a ride round the block in a minute. I really need that extra excercise&nbsp;to get me into shape. Time is running out fast and I'm sitting on my fat arse infront of this computer. Not going to eat anything else tonight. Be strong girl.   AHH SHIT! I ate some cottage cheese at around 10 :30. I'm so pissed off with my lack of self control.&nbsp;Hmm. I guess somewherearound 200 isn't bad, seen as I should be eating 2000 a day.&nbsp; I really cannot wait for the gym. I'm so excited.. I think I'll stay there for as long as phyiscally possible. T'ill I collapse. &nbsp;

      It's been sort of a mixed day, for dieting.  I spent the whole day walking around town with Jenny, looking for presents for her little sisters Birthday. That wasn't too bad, seen as I hadn't eaten anything that day.  We decided that we were going to see Harry Potter (&nbsp;after much walking)&nbsp; and I was worried about movie snacks. The thing is, I haven't built up any resistance against food yet, so my will power is pretty weak, and I knew that if I went to the cinema, I'd end up buying loads of those fatty sweets. So, we took a trip to Holland and Barrat (health food store) I was secretly looking around for diet pills, and I noticed some behind the counter. I wasn't going to ask for them with Jenny there, so I decided to buy some relatively healthy snacks. I chose some chocolate raisins, the bag containing 406 calories. Fretting slightly over this, about how it was my first day ona diet, and I was buying chocolate. In the end I bought them,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; we took a trip to the Cinema.  Seen the film before, but half way through, Jenny ent to buy some M&amp;M's, and I ate some. I felt so greedy afterwards, and just wanted to throw them up, and punish myself for eating too much. In totaly, I think I must have eaten about 620 calories of her food. That brings my day's total up to 1020. I also just ate two nectarines, which brings my total calories for the day up to 1130. Not bad I suppose, for a first day; and I think I did burn off a few calories with all that walking around town.  However, the good news, is that Jenny and I are joining a gym. This will be a good thing for me, I think as seen as we are both joining together, we can go together and workout at the same time. Last time I joined a gym, I felt so paranoid about people watching my and laughing at how fat and ugly I was.&nbsp; With someone I know there, I don't think it will seem as bad. Also, we'll beable to go swimming. Even though I hate being in a swimsuit, I like swimming. It used to be my main hobby, infact. With&nbsp;Jenny there, I won't mind swimming around strangers as much.  I also bought a&nbsp;ner notebook/journal type thing. If I work hard, I might beable to memorize a simple code, so I can take it to school and write down my thoughts then, to type up. Or, simply when I don't have access to a computer.  I'm going to town again, tomorrow. I'll probably walk again, and maybe we can even start on the gym then! Or maybe I'll cycle. No, don't be stupid Pippa, there's too much traffic, and you'll make a fool of yourself&nbsp;on a bike.  Jenny's&nbsp;going to have a free makeover in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Body Shop.  I'm wondering if I'd beable to go cycling around the streets at this time. I know I'd look a fool, but I mean, it'd be more excerise for me; God knows I need it.  I think I'll go for tonight, but I'll update if I'm stupid enough to eat anything else, or I ahve any more weight loss ideas.  A few of&nbsp;my favourite shows are on T.V tonight. Something to cheer myself up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      First of all, I'll tell you about myself before I talk about this diary. My name is Pippa, I'm 15 and&nbsp;I live in England. The summer holidays started about a week ago, and up till now I've done nothing but waste my life sitting at this computer. I've been eating as much (maybe even more) than I would in term time, and then, I get far more exercise. I'm 5ft6 and I weigh around 67kg. I've always though I was fat. Probably since the age of about 6 when my mother was telling me I should eat less, and stop acting like a pig, because then I might not look like one. I've been on diets before, but I've not really stuck to them.&nbsp; However, this holidays is going to be different. I AM going to lose weight this year. When I go back to school, I want people to go 'Wow! Pippy, you look great!' Not just the usual 'Oh, it's you.' I want to be noticed for the right reasons, not just for being the sulky, fat cow that everyone hates. This diary, is going to be by Thinspiration. I am going to succeed this year, and I'm going to meet my target. In one month, I'm going to try and lower my wieght to 55kg. I used to weight about this much at some time last year, so I don't think itwill be too hard. However, this isn't going to be my final target weight. My ideal, dream weight would be somewhere around 8 stone. I would kill to look like that. In this diary, I'm going to record what I eat, write when I'm craving food and when I'm feeling down. This diary is going to&nbsp;be my motivation. My Thinspiration. This time, I will suceed.
