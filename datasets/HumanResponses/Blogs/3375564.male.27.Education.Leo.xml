      I know I am not a good person to talk about GMAT Verbal strategies, since 84 Percentile is not something often to be considered "outrageously excellent", but nevertheless I would like to mention a few more things here.  1. Sentence Correction Section  I believe that this section is the easiest to master.  Getting a grasp on SC has nothing to do with your IQ, your creativity, your income potential, or your inherent knowledge.  Rather, it has everything to do with your sheer determination and focus.  As I have mentioned, carefully EXAMINE (not read) the explanation provided at the end of Official Guide.  Try to read through each answer choices, even the wrong ones.  Many people may just read through the explanation for the correct answer, but I really oppose that.  By reading the remaining "wrong" answer explanations, you might unconsciously develop the "feel" for the actual test.  So, in all, you should spent at least 3~5 minutes per question on the Official Guide.  Once you are over the 85% threshhold on your practice questions, you are left only with the final "string-knotting" process, in which you can focus on idiom usages and lists.    I emphasize the efficient approach on the SC section on the actual test.  You can't re-read SC questions in order to double-check your answer if you want to allocate enough time to finish the Critical Reading section.  You must move at the efficient speed on SC section, because you will get a bump or two at the Critical Reading section.  2.  Critical Reading Section  In between the finishing of math section and the start of verbal section, I wrote down "1" through "41" and "A" through "E" for answer choices for each question on verbal section on a piece of scratch paper given at the testing site.  For that matter, I actually implemented this strategy solely for the Critical Reasoning part.  I knew, before the test, I would face situations where I would be successful in eliminating a few answer choices and left with two or three answer choices.  You must feel comfortable in finding the right answer from this approach (widely known as "POE": Process of Elimination) AS MUCH AS you feel comfortable in selecting the correct answer from the 5 answer choices.  In a nutshell, you have to be in your own comfort zone in dealing with inevitable "Elimination and Guess" processes, because you will face a bunch of questions in which you would be contemplating between "C" and "E".  A. "According to the passage/author" question type  Whenever you see this question, tell yourself, "Stop and stop thinking.  I need to FIND, not think."  This has been an effective approach for me, since you are only being asked to find the correct answer, not to understand the author's hidden agenda in the passage.  For instance, let me give you this question:  FACT: "John Doe received 90% on his algebra test.  The rest of his class all received 100% on the same test."  CONCLUSION: "Thus, we can conclude that John Doe's score of 90% is not a good score, since the score is below the class average."  True or not?  The short answer is false, because the conclusion that the score is "not a good score" has no basis.  We do not know the basis of "not a good score".  In other words, it might be a good score if all the students in the class got A AND if the criteria is "A" = good.  It might be a bad score if all of the students got F, AND if the criteria is "F" = bad score.  In other words, some of us could have answered "true" on the question above, because we have tendency to INFER the basis of such reasoning on the class average, as opposed to other critera not specifically explained above.  As for Paraphrasing, I believe that "numbering" is also another good method in following the author's argument.  For instance,  "Company A perceives the advantages of market because the company has cash flow, good employees, enough investments, and favorable market condition."  Paraphrasing: "Com. A: Adv., 4", meaning "company A has 4 advantages."  By numbering factors, criteria, arguments, citations, examples, you are naturally preventing yourself from re-reading the whole paragraph, so that when you see a question, "Which of the follwing is NOT mentioned as the Company A's advantages?", you automatically understand where to look for answer.    I hope this helps.  I feel your pain.  Studying GMAT is a pain in the arse, but there are some known methods in approaching questions.    Good luck to all of you who are still in the hunt.  And please let me know of your progress/results.

      As most of you guys probably know, the Lakers are up 3-1 against Timberwolves in the Western Conference Final series, which brings up my favorite Kobe moment....  Some years back when I was still in college, I and my friends were watching a Lakers game in some crowed sports bar.  At the time, Kobe was young.  He was still inexperiened, helplessly ball-hogging (still to this day), and a constantly crying "me, me, me" type of player (still to this day).  In one particular possession, he kept holding on to the ball, weaving through the traffic, ignoring his teammates, doing 360-degree dribbling, dribbling behind his back, and other silly one-on-one street hoops move.  As the shot clock was tickng down, all of us were in dismay, shouting, yelling, screaming "Pass the freacking rock!", "You ain't Michael Jordan, give up the ball!", "This is Shaq's team! Not yours!". Then, he did some stupid move to the basket, trying to go up against two 7-footers in the air, cluess about what he was about to do.    Unable to resist the urge, I "rose to the occassion", getting up from my seat and yelling out "Pass the fucking ball, you ball-hogging piece of shit, Michael-wannabe!"    Swish.    He made the unbelievable shot, double-clutching on the way to the basket and 2 points.  Inevitably embarrassed, I softly sat down back to my seat and shouted, "Good shot, Kobe!  Great shot!  There you go!", clapping my hands in a vote of confidence at the same time.

      "One guy I interviewed was definitely quite enamored with himself," says Sullivan. "He sat back and acted like I should do a sell job on him, but was so aggressive I had a hard time getting my questions in." But what came next made his jaw drop, says Sullivan. "His cell phone rang, and he took the call rather than turning it off. I had the strong sense he'd staged the whole thing. After talking for a minute or two, he told the caller he was in the middle of something, then turned back to me, without apologizing, and proceeded with the interview." Far from impressing him, says Sullivan, the candidate came off as a jerk, and not a very bright one at that.    Now, throwing that lazy 70-mph fastball (since it's too obvious) to so-so hitter like University of South Alamaba is one thing.  Trying to sneak in that shit to a top hitter in the league like Hass is an invitation for getting "posterized", which he enamoredly became the receipient in this anecdote.  This makes me feel better.  Knowing that there are still some people like this guy even at top schools assures me that the "actual" acceptance rate might be higher for some normal people like us.

      I really didn't like the movie.  It seems as if they were trying to squeez in 5 hours worth of movie scripts into 2.5 hours.  Dramatic moments at times seemed a bit dull.  Which brings up my all-time favorite movies including all genres of the movies.  1. Hoop Dream - sheer drama, true story with only one fitting ending, dedication on the part of producers to follow two boys over the span of 5(?) years.  2. Matrix I - sleeper by nature.  I didn't go to the movie theater to watch it.  Rather, I calmly waited for the movie to come out in the video.  To my plesant surprise, I found the movie very insightful.  I could totally see what the director had in mind when he set up the whole situation with "what you see is not what it is" theme.    3. Bridges of Madison County - I am not mushy by nature, but this movie did bring a few teardrops, I confess.  Actually, for that matter, this is the first time I ever watched a movie in movie theater all by myself.  I just didn't want my friends to see me...crying.  Great acting by Eastwood and Strip.  4. Identity - a big fan of John Cusack.  Disappointing closure at the end as the kid is the guilty party.  Memorable final line by John Cusack, "I see you with oranges".  Funny, I saw the movie with my brother, and I was all fired up during the movie for my keen ability to identify the "real killer" in these kind of movies.  When the father was seen in the movies, I quickly whispered to my brother, "hey, that's the killer, I know for sure!", perhaps too loudly enough for other people around me to hear.  Of course, the father gets killed right after I whispered to my brother, bringing out some cynical giggling from a few people around me.  Nevertheless, a good movie with alot of "food for thoughts".  5. Gladiator/Brave Heart - similar movie about heroism in the face of adversaries.  All about the manhood.  No, I didn't cry.  I just thoroughly enjoyed the movies.

      Today, I was "running" on a treadmill, casually strolling at the speed of 6.0.  I was on the treadmill in the back row with 5 other overweight guys, with another 4 skinny guys running on the front row of treadmills.  Most of us were just walking at a leisurely pace of something like 6.0~7.0, hardly breaking sweats.  After all, summer was still a couple months away, and most of us still invariably girlfriend-less.  Then, all of sudden, this girl, who looks very open-minded at a first glance, walks in with some very intriguing outfits that would make Brittany Spear blush in utter embarrassment and starts stretching right in front of us, vividly guiding us to the each step of her elegant moves.      Understanding the urgent need to emerge out of the pack, suddenly, each of us started to pick up the pace, with some of the guys even running at the speed of 14 or so.  I think, on average, we ran at the speed of 11, keeping our postures as straight as possible, as intructed by our unconscious instincts.    Then, after a few minutes of stretching, she decided to go for water, leaving the room with the air of restless anxiety and unshakeable disappointment.  And, simutaneously as she was exiting, all of the guys decides to scale down back to the leasurely pace of 6.0.  Some of the guys were already seen taking a deep breath or two at very unrregular intervals, and a few others coughing like a jackass.  I, of course, a practical man who has always been keenly aware of my conditioning, or lack thereof, firmly pressed "URGENT-STOP" button as soon as she was out of the sight.    No one said anything, but invariably everyone understood.  Some smartass kid starts giggling as if he was the only one understanding the trend.  But we all knew.  We all knew that, even without a single word of exchange, we were a bunch of losers, still living in the imaginary world of glory previously initiated and subsequently perpetuated by our own fantasies, fantasies beyond the manageable compass, yet within the idealistic realm filled with burning desire for that elusive moment.    Today was a good day.  Another day of introspection, indeed.

      "I'm amazed by the how GMAT envy is to Indians what penis envy is to Americans."  I remember my days during undergraduate, and a couple of my Indian friends got into a shouting match.  And it turns out to be that they were debating the cut off GPA for I Banking position..... 3.4 vs. 3.5.

      Another Funny post from BWeek   "I am absolutely sick of idiots who keep on posting messages asking for advice on picking school A over school B, while offering no more information on their backgrounds. Half the time these punks are just trying to boost one particular school, as they probably did not even make it into the other.  When people spend money and time filling out application forms, don't they prioritize which schools they really want? And if not, how hard can it be to decide without having to ask for strangers with all sorts of vested interests to help.   I can understand a Stanford vs Harvard debate for the sake of argument, but I'll go nuts if I see one more Rochester vs Wharton thread or the occasional UCLA vs Stanford bullshit.   So for now let us stick to the following rules:   1. H/W/K/S are the top schools for anything. Even if you want to specialize in Martian Real Estate Finance, one of those four schools would serve you better than any school on Mars.   2. No tier 2 school should EVER be compared to a tier 1 school. Scholarship offers be damned!   3. There is nothing like a "top-tier ivy." If you are willing to tell us that you went to an Ivy league school then you should be damn sure ready to tell us which one it was and let US decide where it ranks.   4. Mensa is not spelled "MENSA." It is not an acronym.   5. Exams are taken, not given.   6. Carter Mayfield is the only person allowed to sign his name. Under no circumstance should YTN, Mark Callaghan or Van Staake signatures be tolerated.   7. No posting should be this long. "

      Isn't it amazing that, as we are approaching essays, how quickly the value of GMAT score has been diminishing in the broad context of whole application package?  Think about it.  Out of 20~25 minutes they will spend in reviewing in your application, the adcom people will spend no more than 10~20 seconds in taking a quick glance at my GMAT score.

      I know it's a tad early to start writing about an essay, but given the potential hazard in the future, I might just well start doing some stuff at this stage.   Havard Essay #1:   Typical Leadership experience question.  However, we should keep the word "recent" in mind.  It seems like HBS people are more interested in reading some recent leadership experience so that they can effectively evaluate your leadership potential.  I think I am gonna talk about the leadership experience I will have in the upcoming months when I will be an Academic Director.  Unfortunately, my leadership moment back in 2002 would have been nicer, given that I lead a team of consultants for a "sexy" project of F500 multinational company operating in Korea.  I guess I have to talk to some people about this choice of my leadership experience here.  400 word limit seems to imply that the adcom's preferance is to keep all those "gibberish" comments off the essay.  Straight "what have you done? why did you do what you did?" thing.  It would be highly appropriate for anybody to write 80~100 words to set up the situation with any tangible background information and to spend next 300~320 words to write about what you did and your subsequent reflection and result on the actions.  It will be interesting given the word limit.  It will be a very dry, very serious essay with the subsequent analyses to be done by HBS adcom on the underlying principles of my actions.   Wharton Essay #1:  Now, I gotta love Wharton adcom.  They are actually sensitive enough to allow us to tinker with 1000 words here.  Most likely I will talk about what I have learned in this global economy with a variety of job functions (this is critical one for me, since I have to turn all those adverse spotty job changes into the positives by emphasizing the fact that I have had fortunate experiences of having worked at different cultures and different climates over the previous 4 years.  Compared to the 400 word limit imposed by HBS, this essay should be easier to write and to be "poetic" to a certain degree.  I have to justify my future career plan, my short term plan, why Wharton, why now, why MBA, and my prior experiences in 1000 word limit.  Dauting, but not impossible.  I am already approaching 600 word limits as I have covered up my previous work experience. (Of course, I envision about at least 5~6 revisions over the course of next few months on this essay.)  Glad to have some room to add some "flavor" here.  Thank you Wharton!

      Contrary to my initial expectation, I am getting very useful information from admission consultants.  Previously, I mentioned my "blind date" with Sandy Kreisberg, and I shall mention again that it wasn't a plesant experience from my ego's perspective.  He basically said that, at first glance, I wasn't pretty enough or sexy enough for him.  Getting a cold shoulder from one of the hottest chicks at a local bar is one thing.  Getting told that I am not sexy enough by admission consultant is heart-breaking. However, I believe that Sandy will be a good consultant for some of you who are still searching for that elusive answer to "why MBA and why now".  He seems like an ideal person for procratisnating, undisciplined, and unorganized applicants who need some good yelling in getting the job done.  Overall, he seems to actually have much useful "inside" information.  Since I fall into the category of "look, I am paying you to work for me, not vice-versa!", it is highly unlikely that I will hire Sandy in the near future.   Accepted.com: Linda Abraham   After I saw how much work she's been doing on BusinessWeek website, I decided to call her a few days ago. Prior to calling her, I sent a one-page length of my background information, from my academic profile, work experience, to my extracurriculars and my long term objectives. To my pleasant surprise, she actually took time and talked to me for about 40 minutes without giving me any signs of getting irritated or frustrated with my aggressive interrogations.  Obviously, the fact that she seems to recognize my unresistable charm has something to do with this.  Eh...  back to the original topic.  She provided very useful information about what to do and what not to do in writing essays, even though the information are somewhat basic and self-explanatory.  However, she did give me a good tip on what I should write about some of the skills I have learned from teaching.  Among some things, she mentioned about "communication skills", which I had never thought about until this moment.  So it was a good session, obviously.  The impression I got from her throughout the session was that she does actually know alot of stuff and has experience to show for.  Unfortunately, she mentioned that she is not working with applicants directly, and that she was more of an editor and a manager who oversees the operation.  She said that she will have me assigned to a consultant named "Jennifer Bloom", whom I have not yet spoken to.  Overall, I got a good vibe from her, and I really sensed that she was down-to-earth, sincere, honest, and most importantly a person with intergrity whom I can build personal relationship with beyond conventinal client relationship.  The only knock on her is that she doesn't seem to work with clients directly, despite her claim that she does some editing work on essays.  Overall, a big thumbs-up.  I may consult with Jennifer on my first essay of Harvard ("the recent leadership experience"), but the jury is out on Jennier at this moment.  The cost?  $700 per essay, with $450 per subsequent essay thereafter.   Clearadmit.com     Graham Richmond   I finally got to talk to him live by calling him in France.  Previously, I sent him an email with the same profile letter attached.  He had not called me back, so I decided to give him a ring.  As I expected, he was very personable, professional, and insightful.  The major advantage of his service seems to be his prior working experience in actual adcom setting, his MBA experience with Wharton, and his current position as an admission consultant.  I ended up talking to him for more than 50 minutes, 50 minutes of free consultation.  Like Linda, he is a good one, confirming some of the things on my application which I had previously confirmed with various people and suggesting various positionings for me to pursue my application essay process.  I could sense that he was genuinely interested in getting to know his clients, and he seems to impply the notion that "what makes you unque" part of essay is a very critical element.  Upon finishing talking to him, I already made my mind working with him on my Wharton essay.  It will cost me around 4~5 hours worth of his services for my whole Wharton package, including essays, resume, recommendation, and other stuff.  His service is $185 per hour if I buy a block of 4 hours, otherwise $200 per hour.    Overall, I have to give Graham a big thumbs-up for his professional attitude and his genuine interest in his clients.  He has already sent me a quetionairre to fill out.  You gotta love that!      I really believe that each of you should initiate conversation with these people first.  They usually allow 30 minutes or so to talk to you without charing you a dime, and I think everyone should take advantage of this "free offer".  My take on these two consultants is that you can't go wrong with either as long as you are aware of your own weaknesses and limitations.  I mean, after all, they can't help you mitigate sub-600 GMAT score with 55% Q percetile, no matter how much you pay them.  Good luck.

      Angry Young Summer Associate  By Tim Shields, MBA 2   Well, summer is over and by all relevant measures it was a smashing  success; after all, in addition to getting to spend 110 hours a week next to Iris, my job provided me with a whole new crop of people towards whom I could direct my rage and bitterness. The 38 members of my Investment Banking Summer Associate class represented a wide range of personality types, from the merely obnoxious to the moderately narcissistic to the overwhelmingly repugnant. What amazed me most of all was how these differences invariably broke down along school lines. I had always been of the impression that all MBA students were more or less the same, allocated in some random fashion  (a.k.a. the admissions process) to the various schools. I was wrong.  I was very wrong. The differences between people from school X versus  school Y are enormous, and I write this column to provide you with a useful glimpse of the person you might have been if Marie's dart had landed just a tad to the right.   Without Further Adieu:   Wharton. These people were frightening. Like caged tigers long  deprived of fresh kill, they descended upon Wall Street seeking to satiate their unquenchable thirst for discounted cash flows, coverage ratios, and, of course, 'the Big Deal.' They were boorish and dull, and interacting with them was like being locked in a room with a Bloomberg machine, except that the Bloomberg screen has two dimensions. Their armor was not impenetrable, however, and I loved tugging at their Achilles' heel. It annoyed them to no end when I referred to them as 'the Penn people.' They also have this  complex about their status in the b-school hierarchy, desperately  trying to convince themselves that everyone buys into Business Week's  assessment of their school. When one of the Wharton people expressed to me his disappointment at the number of fellow summer associates who were not from Stanford, Harvard, or Wharton, thus presumably reflecting poorly on the Bank's recruiting efforts and relative prestige, I concurred, noting that 'at Goldman they hire nearly exclusively from Stanford and HBS, which explains its sterling reputation.' His subsequent wince was one of the highlights of my summer.   Columbia. Sort of Wharton-lite, Columbia MBAs were finance semi-gurus  with a little less attitude. Having successfully climbed over the backs of their classmates in order to obtain one of the precious few slots allocated by Wall Street firms to the hundreds of eager Columbia MBAs, it was always great fun to tell them how by comparison it was so remarkably easy to obtain an investment banking job from Stanford. 'My background? I worked in a food pantry in Appalachia for a couple of years after obtaining my peace studies degree from a junior college in Arkansas. I also failed my finance and  accounting core classes in business school, so I was really surprised  when I had eleven banking offers for the summer. Do you think that would have happened if I had gone to Columbia?' Yeah, I loved doing that. If I was in a truly nasty mood, I would follow up with a discussion hypothesizing on the quality of life differences between Palo Alto and Harlem. As you might guess, I wasn't too popular among the Columbia crowd.   Kellogg. Believe it or not, I actually like the Kellogg people. Not  the sharpest ginsu knives in the set, they were as out of place on Wall Street as you might expect from people who'd spent the prior year intensely debating the merits of Dave Thomas appearing in person in the Wendy's commercials. Still, they were all pretty cool and laid back and into having a good time. I thought they would have fit in quite well here at Stanford; in fact, if you took the average Stanford MBA, subtracted 50 IQ points and added a penchant for sub-zero weather (probably related to the lost IQ points), you would have a Kellogg MBA.   MIT/Sloan. I think I found Waldo. Every stereotype you have ever  heard about MIT is true. These guys were such incredible weenies, brilliantly managing to combine both the brainpower and social grace of an HP19B-II. Every time one of them came anywhere near me I did my best to convey a look which said quite plainly: 'go away - now.' I was generally unsuccessful, as they would not budge until they had finished telling me how they had been working until 5am every day this week on such and such a glamorous and sexy project, and  that they had worked on a project similar to the one I was assigned  to 'when they first started.' Moments before going postal, I could usually get them to leave me alone by making a comment to the effect of 'it must be a bummer constantly having to remind people that the school you go to in Boston is not Harvard.'   Harvard. Speaking of Harvard, I've got to hand it to the HBS people.  Their ability to mask their general incompetence with sheer arrogance  impressed me. Floating through the summer like Cinderella at the ball, they expected you to accept their jargon-laced drivel with the same attitude that Moses and his stone tablets received on Sinai. Universally despised, they were oblivious to the disdain they inspired among their summer classmates. I suspect they would have been indifferent, though, associates being several levels below anyone they considered worthy of their attention.   Others. There were also a few stragglers from other random schools.  To quickly summarize, Darden and Chicago people get a thumbs-up; NYU and Yale a thumbs-down. There were also a few ranch-hands from Canadian schools who I thought should have been raising cattle or growing wheat or doing whatever it is they do in Canada, but probably not investment banking, eh.

      I can't believe I haven't yet written anything about this.  I need to priortize my stuff here.  For those of you who are looking for some meaninful community service, try volunteering at "Juvenile Prison Center".  If you are living in America, I am sure you can easily find one nearby :)  I am not going to lie to you.  I first decided to do some community service to beef up my extracurricular activities for the application purpose, but as I spend more and more time with those kids, they have been a pleasant surprise for me. I didn't know how significant this experience will be, but now I really care less now whether this "EC" will help me gain admission to a top MBA program.  Korea, a homogeous country comprised of 99.99% Koreans, is devoid of racial problems so rampant in America and other European countries.  However, Korea has its own social problems.  People are often and heavily judged upon by their socioeconomic position more than anything, and this has been the main knock on Korea through its entire history.  More than anyone, I believe that these kids needs some benefits of doubts.  I mean, it's not like they killed someone, dealed drugs, or committed an act of treason.  Most likely, they probably stole something, broke into some place, or simply "fooled around" when they shouldn't have.  Again, I am only making a light-hearted assumption here.    I just hope, I just hope that there are some wise adults in every corner to talk to these kids when they go out.  Korea has also its own version of "streets", quite distinct from the one in the US, yet similar in its cruelty.

      I talked with Sandy (http://world.std.com) who is a fairly well-known admission consultant.  He really let me know where I stood against my competitors for the upcoming 2005 application, in no uncertain terms.  I thought I was registering for a boot camp initially.  He said, "You worked for shitty companies, you got shitty grades, you went to okish school, you barely got over the decent score on GMAT, and say what?  You want some corporate restructuring job after HBS MBA?  Wake up!  You live in a cuckoo land!  You have zero chance of getting into HBS, zero!"  The lack of blue-chip work experience along with fuzzy career progression with equally puzzling career goal basically puts my application in the bottom rung of the applications, he seems to imply.  I probably don't have to tell you how I felt at the moment.  I think the long pause of silence rather spoke for the state of my mind.  In all honesty, this hurt me a little bit, especially after I got somethin like "91" on my IQ test (see below for link).  However, after a few minutes of regrouping, I kinda saw through his initial remarks.  He was inviting for my strong opinion to speak up.  He wanted to see whether my resilency would emerge amid those harsh moments to validate my strong desire to pursue the tough road ahead of me.  He also mentioned that I might have "a shot" for Wharton, given right execution (his buzz words).  Funny thing, right after finishing talking with him, I went to the BusineWeek forum and found the thread where a HBS alum named "PersCoach" shared her insightful knowledge regarding the HBS admission. And this certainly helped as she told that she only had 2.9 GPA (granted, it's Ivy League GPA in a tough engineering major).  She really seemed to imply that the unique experience regardless of the scales of such size is what HBS is looking for, and I believed her.  Well, today was a good day.  I definely woke up, and now I know that I have to squeez up more juicy insights in order to justify "why MBA, why now" question - perhaps the single most important question of the most important criteria for just about any MBA admission procedures.

      From BusinessWeek,  "Katrina Gill, a 36-year-old certified nursing aide, worked in one of the premiere long-term care facilities near Portland, Ore. From 10:30 p.m. to 7 a.m., she was on duty alone, performing three rounds on the dementia ward, where she took care of up to 28 patients a night for $9.32 an hour. She monitored vitals, turned for bedsores, and changed adult diapers. There were the constant vigils over patients like the one who would sneak into other rooms, mistaking female patients for his deceased wife. Worse was the resident she called "the hitter" who once lunged at her, ripping a muscle in her back and laying her flat for four days.   Last month, Gill quit and took another job for 68 cents an hour more, bringing her salary to $14,400 a year. But like so many health-care workers, she has no health-care benefits from her job. So she and her garage mechanic husband pay $640 monthly for a policy and have racked up $160,000 in medical debts from their youngest son Brandyn's cancer care.  In New York City, Joseph Schiraldi, 41, guards one of the biggest terrorist targets in the world: the Empire State Building. For eight hours a day, he X-rays packages, checks visitors' IDs, and patrols the concourse. But on $7.50 an hour in the priciest city in the U.S., he's a security officer without security -- no pension, no health care, and no paid sick days, typical for a nonunion guard.  Bellingham (Wash.) day-care teacher Mandy Smith can't afford child care for her 6-year-old son, Jordan, on her take-home pay of $60 a day. Neither can commercial cleaner Theresa Fabre on her $8.50 an hour job. So her son, Christian, 9, waits for her after school in a crumbling upper Manhattan library where the kids line up five-deep to use one of two computers. The librarian doubles as a de facto babysitter for 40 or so other kids of the working poor."   God Bless these people.  They deserve some benefits of doubt.

      I was surfing over the BWeek board, and the topic was "is it too early to go home?"  There were a handful of people who were debating whether they should go home around 3 PM on Friday, since the boss has already left.  Man, I was laughing my ass off!  This message reminded of the times when I was working as a financial analyst back in LA.  In short, Thursday was Friday for us.  Come Friday, we would stroll to the work around 9:30~10:00, trying to look busy for about a couple of hours before the lunch time.  Of course, we would spend a bulk of these hours checking emails, checking voicemails, IMing friends who are also keenly aware of the day of the week, and surfing the web.  Then, we, obviously in bunch, would go to lunch for about 90 minutes.  The only reason we didnt stay for more than 2 hours is that we would feel too guilty had we stayed beyond the "2 hour" limit stated by the virtue of "unspoken rule" of our office.  So we come back at 1:30ish, and for the next 2 hours, we would call some people (of course, I leave message on their VM, since no one wants to talk on the phone on Friday), get some financial analysis done, which anyone could have done in a span of 15 minutes, talk to boss about the upcoming projects (just to show that you are eagerly looking forward to the next Monday).  When the clock shows 3:30ish, we, of course in bunch, head down to Starbuck for a "quick" coffee.  What I mean by "quick" coffee, I mean at least a half-hour.  After a quick coffee break, we would come back to the office around 4:10ish.  And by the time we come back up, the boss is already gone, having left for the weekend.  I am like, "so can I go now?", obviously I am only talking to myself at this time, since everyone is already packing their bags and ready to go home.  I would usually surf the web for extra half-hour and would leave for good at around 5ish.  Just shows how wonderful our American corporate culture is.  Friday is not a Friday.  It is a day to reflect how much you have worked over the previous four days, a day to contemplate about exciting work projects you will have in the follwing week, a day to plan and schedule productive weekends, a day to enjoy your life, and a day to jerk off in front of your computer monitor since you have nothing better to do.

      I couldn't resist the temptations of logging in again and posting this message about some of the reflections I just had about MBA essays.  I have been actively browsing through some of the fellow MBA blogs who have succeeded in gaining admission to top MBA programs and who have not.  I am trying to find common themes or traits being developed here, but obviously it is hard, almost impossible.  The variety of applicants and their previous experiences makes it hard for me to find, say, formula,which is understandable.    However, the one thing I can say is that the successful MBA applicants have shown strong signs of confidence in their jouney to the MBA.  True, there were times that they were stressed out, but in overall pictures, I can actually sense that they have been enjoying this ride, as much as the moments have been agonizing for them.  On a side note, these are some of the useful reminders when approaching essays:  1.  You have to make a seamless story of a full picture of your goals, your previous achievement, and your current status and positions with your insights on who you are and what you are.  In a nutshell, Previous Achievements => Present Status, Present State of Mind, and Present Responsibilities => Future Goals and Future Career Aspirations.  The logical flow from the first to the end has to be smooth, leaving no questions to the admcom people along the way.  Obviously, this is easier said than done.    So, let's examine my case for a quick example.  "Real estate consultant, financial analyst => teacher => consulting and entrepreneur"  See what I mean?  There is no logical flow here in my case in apparent glance.    And this will be a daunting task for me to pursuade admcom people and more importantly myself to make sure with detailed insights of who you are and what you are and with equally detailed anecdotes that this picture of your long terms diagram does indeed make sense.  Many people seem caught up in the fact that they have to touch on several key traits in their essays, such as leadership potential, teamwork traits, initiatives, humanitarian characteristics, etc.  However, what is more important at least from my opinion is that you have to develop a clear, concise, and overwhemingly pursuasive diagram of your past, present, and future roadmap so that MBA at this juncture of time does make sense to me and to others who read my essays.

      Verbal:  1. Improvement in Sentence Correction should be a matter of time.  Given time and effort, everyone should significantly improve score on SC section.  Implication?  practice, practice, and practice.  I can confidently proclaim that I can now get about 90% of the SC problems right, should I have to retake the exam - indeed, a significant improvement, considering the fact that my initial performance on SC yielded only about 50% correct answer.  You should "get down and get nasty" with SC by doing each and every problem on the OG, preferably more than twice throughout.  Make sure you fully understand the basis behind each explanation.  2. The Reading Comprehension is by far the hardest part to master, yet the easiest part to improve.  Paraphrasing is your best friend when you approach the RC section.  Knowing what they are saying and actually paraphrasing each paragraph with the diagram drawn to illustrate the clear process of logics are two different things.  GMAT RC is not to test your understanding skill, rather it is a test to evaluate your understanding of logical path flows used in the passages (so to speak.  Do the following for each passage:  for example:  1st Paragraph: "Beta vs. VCR and their pros and cons"  2nd Paragraph: "Beta's cons and VCR's pros in the market share, stratgies, and marketig alliancements"  3rd Paragraph: "Author's opinion on VCR's emergence in the heavily competed market"  With such a paraphrasing work, you should be able to sharpen your critical reading abilities.  I reiterate again the importance of doing paraphrasing for each paragraph; they will pay off at the end.  3. Do not underestimate the difficulty of Critical Reasoning part.  I was fucked over by CR part on my second part.  There were strings of "inferred" questions on the test; I was just awed by the difficulty of some of these questions.  Try LSAT CR questions, and try to read each explanation in detail to prepare for some "unexpected".

      I went down to Pusan by flight for a seminar with parents.  Pusan is supposed to be the second largest city in Korea, second only to Seoul, but from my perspective, it's hardly a city, with a few scattered office buildings here and there, and with about one-tenth of the market size of Seoul.  Anyway, I met with about 8 parents who bombarded me with questions, such as "What is your strategy on teaching TOEFL, SAT, etc, blah, blah,?"  I think the dumbest question of the day has to be when someone mentioned "how much do you think my son will improve over the summer?"  Geez, I don't know.   I may have better luck at answering to "What is the best pickup line?"  Dear parents, there is no formula in getting a high score on a test.  Well, there is.  You just need to study hard at it.  There are some minor strategies you need to keep in mind when you take a test, but to expect such minor strategies to have overwhelming influence on your test score in such a short period of time is absurd and unrealistic.  Talking about tests, I took GMAT 3 times, as previously mentioned.  The score on my first test was in line with my expectation, given that I haven't spent too much time studying for the test.  I think I spent more time worrying about the psychological impact the score would have on me.  And to my dismay, I bombed the second test.  I got a meager 610 on my second test, with my verbal percentile showing a miserable 67%.  (In all honesty, I even went as far as questioning the rigor of my undergraduate institution after having exhausted all of the options avaliable to me in blaming game.)  However, to my pleasant surprise, I increased my score from the second test by exactly 100 points after a couple of months without studying at all!  I think the relaxed state of mind and better focus certainly paid off at the end.  The GMAT is more or less about what you know.  I think it is more about your determination, your focus level, and some random luck involved in giving you a selection of questions from the pool of questions.  So let me give you a quick run-down on what I have learned in approaching GMAT:  Math.  1.  Do not worry about combinatin, permutation stuff.  I repeat, do not worry about combination, permutation materials.  At most, you will be given two very BASIC questions pertaining to these topics, and as long as you know how to solve "5 People in total, 2 People being selected from this group, how many different scenarios?", you are ok.    2. Try to solve every freaking problems on OG.  Understanding the process of solving problems and actually solving the problems using scratch paper are two different things.  And I, of course, heavily emphasize the values of doing the latter for an obvious reason.  You need to keep your quantitative, more specifically, your familiarity with actual calculating process as sharp as possible.    3. Do not give up too easily even if you are stuck.  Contrary to the conventional belief that you need to quickly move to the next question when stuck, I have found many questions that were confusing at first ridiculously easy after carefully examining the concepts in question.  Remember, the length of explantion for the math problems in OG is on average less than a paragraph.  Implication?  Most questions can be solved in quck 1-2 steps method, without doing much calculation.  4. If you have been consistently scoring between 43~46, you should focus more on honing your "soft" skills, rather than trying to focus on gaining "technical" knowledge.  The consistent scoring in this range clearly illustrates that you know what you need to know for the test.  You only need to sharpen your time management skills, your focus level training, your stamina, you psychological mindset, and your determination.  Verbal...more tomorrow.

      man, today was just one of those days.  Throughout the day, I was just thinking about MBA, essays, "why MBA", "why Harvard", "why now", "leadership experiences", etc.  The whole damn thing wouldnt get off my mind!  I think it is natural for me to act this way, since I have already made up my mind to apply for the next year's class.  I was just browsing a blog done by "Tad Holdie", and I must say I am damn impressed  by the level of dedication and insights shown by his whole blog.    It is unfortunate that he will no longer share his wisdoms with me, but I also appreciate his decision to have his blog open still.  It's almost 4 AM, and I am still thinking about this whole MBA application stuff.  THis is just killing me!

      The Year of the MBA Applicant    With fewer prospects and no pickup in sight, B-schools are competing harder -- and offering more perks -- to fill their classes  Until recently, Amitabh Nayak, 27, was weighing a full ride to Purdue University's B-school, with acceptances from both the Chicago Graduate School of Business and Maryland's Smith School of Business. "When I started the process, I thought that Chicago was a little bit of a stretch," he says. Nayak says he had good essays, but only a 690 Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) score and a 3.1 grade-point average in chemical engineering. "I certainly didn't expect a full-tuition offer from Purdue."   Significant declines in application volume at the top management schools have made the 2003-04 MBA admissions season the year of the applicant. Demand for the degree is lower due to a slow economic recovery, fewer MBA-age workers, and fewer non-U.S. applicants. So schools dipped deeper into their applicant pools to find new MBAs -- and deeper into their coffers to help fund them.   "MORE OFFERS."  Plenty of evidence, both anecdotal and statistical, shows that applicants were accepted to more B-schools than in years past. Graham Richmond, CEO of MBA-admissions consultants Clear Admit, says he saw clients get 30% more offers of admission than in the 2003 academic year. "Since we haven't totally changed our methods, and since clients are still applying to the same number of programs [on average], this indicates that the schools must be handing out more offers," he says.   Back in the more competitive years of 2000 and 2001, Richmond says even his best applicants only had a couple of options, "rarely gaining acceptance to more than one of the top three [schools]." In 2004, his clients are weighing offers from the likes of Harvard, Wharton, Stanford, and Columbia. "It's rare to see the top few schools in such direct competition [for the same students]."   Few schools avoided a significant decline in student interest in the 2004 academic year. Heavyweights such as Wharton received 21% fewer applications vs. 2003. Wake Forest University's Babcock Graduate School of Management saw a 29% dip, while the MBA programs at the Tuck School at Dartmouth and UNC's Kenan-Flagler Business School received 25% fewer applications. Washington University's Olin School of Business and UCLA Anderson School of Management saw 21% and 15.8% fewer MBA hopefuls, respectively.   HEDGING THEIR BETS.  Many admissions directors learned early on that fewer people were taking the GMAT. They hedged their bets of enrolling a good class by accepting more applicants in the early season. At Kenan-Flagler, MBA admissions director Sherry Wallace admitted 50% of her class by the end of February, vs. one-third of the class in 2003, an increase of 100 students.   The 2003-04 season had no clear rules. People who applied to schools with a high yield (the number of admitted students who chose to enroll) had a better chance of being placed on a school's wait-list or offered deferred admission. If yields were lower, late applicants found themselves with offers of admission -- and the financial aid that's often reserved for the early birds. Says Rosemaria Martinelli, Wharton's director of MBA admissions and financial aid: "We knew we had to admit more people this year, because when applications are down, your yield falls."   FINANCIAL EXTRAS.  To encourage enrollment, schools opened their checkbooks wider in 2004. Some schools reimbursed admitted applicants for travel expenses to spring admit weekends. Others offered lucrative financial-aid packages to more students.   Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management doubled the $1 million it usually offers MBAs in loans and scholarships. However, Ann Richards, associate director of admissions and director of financial aid at the Johnson School, says, "what we offer and spend are often two wildly different numbers."   New York University's Stern School of Business reintroduced a two-year, full-tuition dean's scholarship, which was limited to a one-year scholarship in the past. "We felt it was something that would help us attract the top students," says Julia Min, assistant dean for MBA admissions. At Kenan-Flagler, 20% of the school's next class of MBAs will receive some sort of fellowship, ranging from $5,000 to full tuition and fees for two years. In 2003, the figure was 13%.   MATCHING OFFERS.  Schools also tried different tactics for doling out scholarship money. Figuring that their top applicants -- those most eligible for merit-based scholarships -- would probably choose to enroll elsewhere, Indiana's B-school decided instead to award money to the people most likely to attend the school. "It's the group in the upper-middle [part of the pool] that we may end up getting," says James Holmen, director of admissions and financial aid.   With tuition starting at $65,000 for top schools, applicants are becoming more active in seeking cost relief. Some are asking schools to match offers from other programs. Wharton's Martinelli says she has heard all sorts of requests this year. "I'm being asked, 'what can you do to match that?,'" she says, adding that she refuses to offer anything more.   Ultimately, it's not about the money, but it's a "fit and educational" issue, she says. She warns that students shouldn't feel overly entitled or be overly demanding because it begins to weaken the educational experience for everyone.   TRICKY SITUATIONS.  Perhaps some admissions offices are playing the game as well. Some B-schools are rumored to be offering money to applicants who have already declined their acceptance offers. BusinessWeek Online couldn't confirm these rumors, but many schools did say they've heard of such tactics from their own applicants.   "This is not a typical practice," says Linda Baldwin, head of MBA admissions at UCLA's B-School. "Trying to persuade someone to renege on a decision they've made puts the applicant in an awkward situation...with ethical dilemmas. It indicates that [reneging] is O.K." Any such practice sharply counters schools' tough policies that MBAs should never renege on job offers they've accepted from corporate recruiters.   Other schools opted to reduce their class sizes to keep quality high. With applications down 30%, Indiana's B-school eliminated one of its four cohorts of students for the class of 2006.   "BETTER TO STAY."  Admissions directors aren't likely to see much of a pickup in the fall. GMAT test-taking is lower than in previous years. From Jan. 1 to Apr. 30, just 70,179 GMATs were taken worldwide, an 8.65% decrease, vs. the same period in 2003. Broken down, the decline is most pronounced outside the U.S., where volume dipped 17.5%.   Signs of an improving economy could also encourage otherwise strong MBA candidates to stick it out in the real world. With a work promotion in hand, Matthew Seim, 28, passed on his admissions offers this year, saying "it's better to stay...and to look at doing an executive MBA program in a few years."   Schools say quality hasn't changed, and that admitted MBAs in 2003-04 have the same caliber of academic, professional, and personal backgrounds as in previous classes. Linda Meehan, head of admissions for Columbia Business School's full-time MBA program, says her selectivity will be a little different from last year, but she's not accepting people she wouldn't normally take. Julia Tyler, director of the MBA program at London Business School, say there's "no way" her office has lowered its standards. "You change your application requirements at your peril, because you will get found out."   Despite his lucrative offer to study for free, Nayak chose Chicago. He'll pay about $73,000 in tuition alone over two years. While money talks, it's clear that it's not all that matters to applicants. But if a top school doesn't offer tuition aid, they might make room for a few more applicants, and that's a trend that many MBA hopefuls would like to see continue.

      It's been a long time since my post.  I have been busy for the past two weeks, trying to organize the project here in Pusan as the first time Academic Director.  As expected, parents have been very aggressive from the start, as every single one of them virtually expect me to single-handedly carry on the task of guiding their sons and daughters to the promised land of "IVY League".  I called one of the mothers whose son was chronically falling in sleep during my class.  Trying to be polite, I mentioned that the student is a very good student when he is awake, always eager to participate in the class discussion, which is true.  To my surprise, she snapped, "well, don't try to make me feel good about the situation by sweet-talking to me about his goody-goodie stuff!"  Indeed, teaching is hard as you, as a teacher, need to find a fine line between a disciplined teacher and compassionate one.  Perhaps I will use this lesson on my essay, after all:)  Now back to Stanford.  I am getting more and more inclined to also apply to Stanford.  I know it will be a long shot, given that I do not have any stellar academic records or GMAT score.  However, I am really getting to like the approaches and philosophies radiated by admcom people through their choices of essay questions.  The first main essay, "What matters to you most, and why?", really strikes me as a very introspective question.  Maybe I am a little melodramatic, but I am getting a vibe that they actually care about the personal characters of applicants.    I am just about done with my Wharton essay, as I do not expect any radical changes on the essay.  I have about 3~4 different themes and explanations in the essay, and the choices of themes will not change since I have thought of this for a long time.  For those of you who are done with GMAT and are waiting for new essays questions from their schools of choice, START EARLY.  I am really seeing the values of starting early as I am getting really comfortable with my Wharton No. essay.  If someone questions the wisdom of picking the themes in the essay, I would probably resort to vigorously defending the choice I made, as opposed to making changes.  This is how much I feel comfortable with my essay.  I believe that the most conventional and most effective steps to start an essay are (1)to outline a list of themes to be used in the essay, (2) find the relevent and HUMBLE stories that reflect the core values of the themes, and (3)draft the first rough draft in some sort of concrete form of any format ASAP just to see whether you like what you see.  The one thing I have had difficulty with is my tendency to get too "philosophical" about some of the stories by circumventing (this's the SAT word of day for you!) the lessons I have learned.  I used to believe that presenting lessons in a downright straight, in-your face way was a bit corny, considering that there are more lessons to be learned during the course of a lifetime.  Since we are going to business school, we do have to use more direct business writing.

      "I don't mean on the BW forum, that's a given.    I mean are we wasting our lives by going to B-School.  Two years in B School followed by most people with IB, MC, Corporate etc. for 40 years, with probably one or two minor career transitions along the way.  Isn't it just a bit too, ordinary?    Good salary, decent but smallish apartment in the city (whatever city) until we get married and/or have kids.  Then move to the suburbs, drive a BMW, get a golden retriever and play golf on sundays.  When we're 80 are we going to regret time spent at the office doing work that was by nearly all accounts trivial and personally unfulfilling?  When we look back, what are we going to say our accomplishments were?  Raising the market share of Tide detergent from 16% to 18%?  Sheperding through 50 IPOs that anyone else on wall street could have done just as well?  As school is getting closer, I'm getting nervous.  Where are the viceral experiences going to be that make life worth living?  Somehow making sure that a client presentation is finished by the 3pm meeting doesn't quite cut it.  Are we going to be the type of people that go on vacation to highly regulated, organized and luxurious wild life safaris and consider it an adventure?  God I hope not."  - "Saathi"  Believe it or not, I have thought about this as well.  As I am approaching my 30's, I have recently become more accustomed to wondering what my life is for.    When it comes down to it, what have you offered to this humanity?  What will you  offer to this society you are living in?    On a very serious level, I have been actively thinking about this very question, and only recently I have come to the final conclusion, my own conclusion, that is.  I am doing as much good to this society or this country as anyone could have done in the sense that I am trying to live a full life, trying to mainly reflect the values of still-developing Christian values I cherish so much.  "A full life" should not always have to be a day filled with attending $10 million fund raising campaign for the cause of hungry children or a day punctuated by helping people save lives.  Rather it could be any of other "normal" days, days filled saying genuine "Hi" to people who would appreciate it, helping an old lady with her luggage with a warm smile, taking time to talk to some of youngsters around us in a casual conversation, and saying a little prayer before every meal and every now or then to honor the One watching over you.  I think the biggest depression and the biggest emptiness in our lives come from our inflated ego - the ego that constantly tells us that we MUST do something "meanigful" to help others, as if carrying out your day and executing your days to the "fullest" degree with sincerity, honesty, integrity, faith, warmth, and hope are not enough.  And I think this is where I part company with some of people out there who are still searching for the clues.  While I must do more and squeeze more from myself each day, each new day, it is my fiduciary duty,  at the same time, to enjoy what I do and respect what I do, regardless of the level of social impact.  This prerequite should be the first step to achieving what I will pursue tomorrow.  Without such self-motivating and self-respecting awarenesses, my life can be as futile as someone who's living on street relying on others for daily survival.  I know so, because I have been there.

      As expected, I am enjoying writing for Wharton essay 1.  I am within the word limit, and I was able to insert 3~4 different themes about me and my professional career.  I did have some problem in articulating my visions for my future career.    I am getting many advices from many different sources that when an applicant articulates his/her short-term career goal, it is highly recommended that the applicant writes down the actual name of company he/she wants to work for.  In this way, you are further highlighting that you have done actual research on the career industry, school, and the company.  I guess it would be even better if the company is among the "top profile" recruiters for the school.  Overall, on my first Wharton Essay 1, I feel good.  However, this doesnt mean that the draft will remain unchanged.  I am being awfully realistic about this.  I know that there will be many, many moments within the next few months that I would be contemplating whether to start fresh anew from the scratch.    And as expected, I am over the word limits (400 words) on my first Havard Essay 1 draft.  I am getting more and more convinced that this short word limit was put on by the adcom people so that applicants will be forced to speak only one or two important things about the lessons learned in this essay.  In order words, the adcom people seem to use the word limit as a tool of "enforcer" so that each applicant would only discuss about one or two meaningful lessons.  In order words, each applicant must choose only one or two things as the most important lessons.  Kinda of "pick your poison" stuff.

      I went to Wharton Club of Korea infor. session a couple of days ago.  In short, the alums were mostly recent graduates, having graduated in the past 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; As expected, they are top-notch intellectuals, clearly evident by their respective job positions and the way they carried themselves during the Q&A session.&nbsp; I would like to share a few things you guys might find useful as far as admission questions are concerned.  1.&nbsp; R1 vs. R2   In general, it was the consensus of the whole alum group that there is a marginal difference between R1 and R2.&nbsp; However, one of the more vocal/active alum made an insightful comment that if applicants are ready, they should submit in R1, given the fact that there are LESS applicants in R1, albeit stronger applicants.  2. Why Wharton and Why Now questions.  Almost everyone made a point that articulating these two questions are extremely crucial to standing out in the piles of applications.&nbsp; In other words, the very first essay question is the most important one by far.&nbsp; ( I am sure many of you guys are already aware of this)  3. leadership initiative  Traditionally teamwork emphasized B-school, Wharton has recently made initiatives to strengthen its leadership programs.&nbsp; One of the alum has mentioned that this is a direct response to some "unwarranted" criticism that Wharton lacks some concrete leadership initiatives, compared to other top B-schools.  4. Start with Why MBA question first!  The more knowledgable alum clearly mentioned, in a very strong tone and conviction, that once applicants answered the "Why MBA" question, the rest of essays should "easily fall into the pieces."&nbsp; Obviously, this is easier said than done; however, once you clearly linked the previous work experiences and accumulated skills sets from the working experiences with a set of skills you wish to learn at Wharton, what you have a compelling case of your application.  In general, I really sensed that Wharton is clearly looking for people who want to come to Wharton and have clear goals of what they wish to learn and to do after MBA, rather than "superstars" on paper.&nbsp;   As I am writing this, I am also thinking about re-drafting my first Wharton essay.&nbsp; If you remember, I stated that I was quite comfortable with the earlier drafts of the essay&nbsp;a couple of months ago.&nbsp; Well, I am on my 6th draft at this point:)  I am targeting R1, as I had already jumpstarted the application process.&nbsp; However, I envision I would be doing 10th draft by the time I submit the application.&nbsp; It is a pain.&nbsp; I am not trying to put pressures on myself, but I can't stop thinking about the notion that Wharton essays are by far the "ESSAYS of MY LIFE".

      It was one of the most compelling dreams I ever had in my whole, entire life!   The dream started with Wharton adcom member calling me to notify me of alumni interview schedule.&nbsp;(apparently, I&nbsp;was too&nbsp;busy, even in my dream, to make it to the States for an adcom interview.)&nbsp;She (it was she, for sure) told me that she located one alumni in South Korea, who is someone in high-ranking position working at "Hyundai Engineering" (how specific can a dream be!!! just amazing).  What is further compelling is that, in my reply to her notification, I voiced a legit concern, by asking her, "Is he a Korean-Korean, or is he a Korean-American? Because if situation arises where I have to speak Korean to the interviewer,&nbsp;it would be a very akward situation for both of us."&nbsp; (Normally, you don't analyze in your dream; here, not only had I analysed the implication of interviewing with a fellow Korean who might be in his 40s or 50s, but also I logically voiced my concerns in a polite, but convincing way!!!)  Furthermore, after having finshied talking to the very nice lady (Who might this be, Alex??? I am awefully curious),&nbsp;I moved to&nbsp;the next scene in which I am officially breaking news to a group of my relatives here in Korea. I was sitting in a round dinner table, and I finally broke the news to everyone.   "Well, I guess I am past the first hurdle; I just got an interview invite from Wharton, which means that now my chances of gaining admission is slightly higher than where I have been previously." To my surprise, my oldest aunt shouted, "you go, boy! that's money!"&nbsp; (how weird can my dream be??? She is a traditional Korean lady in her 70's, and she perfectly executes a string of American slangs here, very timely I should mention)  Forget the ranking, Harvard vs. Wharton vs. Stanford, "I only have 780 GMAT, 3.8 GPA, with 'great' essays, now do I stand a chance?" debates.  For anyone who is spiritual by his/her standard, please tell me whether this dream is a sign of actual future, or just a sign of a bad omen?  Maybe I should mention this in my optional essay.&nbsp; I have another reason to go to Wharton.&nbsp; After all, I am being driven by the Divine Power to apply to Wharton this year:)

      One night, George W. Bush is tossing restlessly in his White House bed. He awakens to see George Washington standing by him. Bush asks him, "George, what's the best thing I can do to help the country?" "Set an honest and honorable example, just as I did," Washington advises, and then fades away.  &nbsp; The next night, Bush is astir again, and sees the ghost of Thomas Jefferson moving through the darkened bedroom. Bush calls out, "Tom, please! What is the best thing I can do to help the country?" "Respect the Constitution, as I did," Jefferson advises, and dims from sight.  &nbsp; The third night sleep is still not in the cards for Bush. He awakens to see the ghost of F. D.R. hovering over his bed. Bush whispers, "Franklin, What is the best thing I can do to help the country?" Help the less fortunate, just as I did," FDR replies and fades into the mists.  &nbsp; Bush isn't sleeping well the fourth night when he sees another figure moving in the shadows. It is the ghost of Abraham Lincoln. Bush pleads, "Abe, what is the best thing I can do right now, to help the country?" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abe replies, "Go see a play."&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Not sure how much truth is in this remarks, but you guys may find it amusing, if not useful.  "I have spoken with a formed Ad-Com member. This is how it works:  HBS initially screens applicants with only data points and Essay 1 and 2. That's their first cut.  Applications are then read again 2 times in order to determine interview invites.  Candidates who have a powerful backer have their applications "white-tagged" and are given a special read by Brit Dewey."

      I am sorry, but because of South Korean government's regulation that prohibits viewing www.blogpost.com and www.blogger.com, I can't post reply to your comments.  There are some interesting comments to my post that I would like to reply to; however, ever since the beheading incident of a South Korean in Iraq, South Korean government has apparently restricted access to some websites that may air the videotape of the beheading.  I can post a message, but apparently, I can't see my own posts.  So I will try to post a reply through a post - highly inefficient, but I am doing my best not to ignore thoughful comments.  Laura:  I thought Tim Wields went to Stanford MBA.  Are you sure he went to Wharton?  Brit-Chick:  Yes, I agree with you.  I think the interview process with HBS will be a dauting one.  They will try to find a match through interviewing whether HBS is a good fit for the applicants and vice-versa.  I heard that HBS interviews are the most intense and grueling.

      Try this link.   urlLink    http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/  There are many useful templates you can use without any constraint to copyright issues.  The description is like the following:  1. Corporate finance spreadsheets: These spreadsheets are most useful if you are interested in conventional corporate financial analysis. It includes spreadsheets to analyze a project's cashflows and viability, a company's risk profile, its optimal capital structure and debt type, andwhether it is paying out what it can afford to in dividends.  2. Valuation Inputs Spreadsheets: In this section, you will find spreadsheets that allow you to  a. Estimate the right discount rate to use for your firm, starting with the risk premium in your cost of equity and concluding with the cost of capital for your firm. b. Convert R&D and operating leases into capitalized assets c. estimate the right capital expenditures and diagnose the terminal value assumptions to see if they are reasonable.  3. Big-picture valuation spreadsheets: If you are looking for one spreadsheet to help you in valuing a company, I would recommend one of these 'ginzu' spreadsheets. While they require a large number of inputs, they are flexible enough to allow you to value just about any company. You do have to decide whether you want to use a dividend, FCFE or FCFF model spreadsheet. If you have no idea which one will work for you, I would suggest that you try the "right model" spreadsheet first.  4. Focused valuation spreadsheets: If you have a clear choice in terms of models - stable growth dividend discount, 2-stage FCFE etc. - you can download a spreadsheet for the specific model in this section.  5. Valuation of specific types of companies: Valuation is all about exceptions, and these spreadsheets are designed to help value specific types of companies including:  a. Financial Service firms: While dividend discount models tend to be the weapon of choice for many, you will find an excess equity return model here. b. Troubled firms: You will find an earnings normalizer spreadsheet, a generic valuation model for valuing a firm as a going concern and a spreadsheet that allows you to estimate the probability that a troubled firm will not survive. c. Private companies: You will find spreadsheets for adjusting discount rates and estimating illiquidity discounts for private companies. d. Young and high-growth firms: You will find a revenue growth estimator as well as a generic valuation model for high growth firms in this section.  6. Multiples: You can estimate equity as well as firm value multiples, based upon fundamentals.  7. Valuation in Acquisitions: You can value synergy in an acquiisition and analyze a leveraged buyout.  8. Valuation of other assets: In this section, you will find a model for valuing income-generating real estate.  9. Value Enhancement Spreadsheets: In this section, you will find a spreadsheet that reconciles EVA and DCF valuation, a model for estimating CFROI and a DCF version of a value enhancement spreadsheet.  10. Basic option pricing models: In this seciton, you will find Black-Scholes models for valuing short term options, long term options and options that result in dilution of stock (such as warrants). In addition, you will find spreadsheets that convert Black-Scholes inputs into Binomial model inputs and use the binomial model to value options.  11. Real option models in corporate finance: In this section, you will find three basic real option models - the option to delay, the option to expand and the option to abandon. In addition, the value of financial flexibility is considered as an option.  12. Real option models in valuation: In this section, you will find models to value both a patent (and a firm owning a patent) as an option, natural resource firms and equity in deeply troubled firms.

      Prior to finding out that the new essays for Harvard came out, I had just finished writing Essay #1 based on the last year's essay topic.  For those of you who have not been following the recent trend of HBS's first "trademark" essay question (and the most important, naturally), HBS has been, for some time, really focused on learning the different traits of its applicants through the course of actions they took in MAKING A BIG CHANGE for their respective organizations.  Last year, HBS focused on "recent leadership experience", but apparently, this year, they are back to the original theme of leadership - "the ability to make impact, to make a change on an organization."   Here are my two cents, and I am sure many of you will probably disagree with some of the comments below.  And I welcome any of your insights.  After all, I believe that the collaborative efforts to "hammer down" HBS essay questions should bring out much-needed insights which we can all benefit from.  1.	Describe a significant change that you brought about in an organization and its impact on your development as a leader. (400-word limit)   Analysis: I really believe that HBS adcom chose somewhat too broad topic last year, focusing on "recent leadership."  Apparently, the adcoms must have been bombarded with a string of essays that had focused on some minor leadership experiences of qualified candidates.  This question doesn't really surprise me because I have been hearing constantly how much HBS is obsessed with selecting people who have made impact (change), or at least, have potential to make substantial impact on an organization in the near future - apparently a leading trait of true leader according to HBS "hidden" criteria.    For your information, I have been hearning from numerous, different sources that the most effective, but not typical, approach to pack in your story in this 400-word limit is, first, set up your unique situation within 100 word limit parameter, and spend the remaining 300 words or so in describing the actions you took and the LESSONS you have learned through your unique situation.  Ideally, less generic your lessons are, the better your application will look, obviously.  So I think the best way to finish off this essay is to restate your unique philosophy (read: leadership style) in conherent manner, clearly reflecting your core values and motives behind the actions.  Also, I really believe that your should first mention the changes you have made in your setup, instead of leaving the change part at the very end.  You should immediately present what changes you have made in your setup section.  2.	What are your three most substantial accomplishments, and why do you view them as such?  (600-word limit)   Analysis:  Same as the last year.  I think the ideal combination of "professional achievements" vs. "personal achivements" should be 2:1, well at least for me.  I have talked to several people who are HBS alum, and they have told me that they have included at least one compelling, very personal achievement for this essay.  It could be anything from your struggle to accept Jesus Christ as your savior, completing a marathon despite your above-average weight, or helping other who were in need that have essentially "set the tone" for your values.  3.	Provide a candid assessment of your strengths and weaknesses. (400-word limit)   Analysis:  I really like this one.  For me, I have so many holes and explanations to do, and I couldn't do so based on the last year's essay questions.  Last year, HBS essentially took away many of the opportunities for the applicants to personally market their applications in their own terms.  This year, I guess, HBS is willing to become more sensitive to the needs of well-qualified applicants who may have one or two minor gliches in their career progressions or academic issues in their transcripts.  I really believe that you must put down a real weakness here in essay 2 that you HOPE TO ADDRESS in business school.  "Lack of broad perspectives on managerial issues", "inability to multitask", "desire to learn some cultural diversity", etc.    4.	How do you define success? (400-word limit)   Analysis:  Bravo!  HBS, you really impressed me on this one (not that they would really care).  This essay question has to be one way for them to learn more about your philosophy in life.  The last year's question, "describe the instances you have questioned your values", was apparently too straight forward, forcing many of the applicants to respond to this introspective-oriented question in equally a straight forward manner.  For your information, please check out this link as this article will give you some insights.    http://www.pwcglobal.com/Extweb/NewCoAtWork.nsf/docid/93DD06AA68426C6085256C0F000636FC   - written by a HBS professor: "Four Keys of Enduring Success: How High Achievers Win"  5.	What are your career aspirations, and how can an MBA help you to reach them?  Why now?  (400-word limit)  Analysis:  You really need to provide coherent, focused, realistic, and ambitious career plan in both short term and long term.  I am hearning some conflicting tips about the manner of describing your short-term goal here.  Some say it is ok to describe a couple of jobs in your short term career plan, while others say that you must put down an actual name of a company that you wish to work for in the short term, preferably the one that often comes to HBS during a recruiting season (it shows that you have done some research about the school).    Also, notice that there is no "WHY HBS" in this essay question here, and I don't have any idea on the implication of such obvious omission here.  Anyone with an idea here as to why such blatant omission?  6.	What do you wish the MBA Admissions Board had asked you? (400-word limit)   Analysis: Typical "fill in the blank" question.         Hmmmmm, I am really curious to know what some of your guys out there think of this year's essay topics?  What are the HBS adcoms' motivation for asking such questions?  I really would like to hear, so please feel free to share with me:)

      Guys, I can't overstress the importance of having a clear and realistic, yet ambitious career goals in your essay.  I have been actively talking to several MBA admission consultants through their initial cosultation, and they have all been stressing the importance of presenting clear career goals (ST, MT, LT) that logically tie to the previous working experiences.  I even emailed a draft of my Wharton #1, and to my dismay, most consultants cite the vague, unrealistic career goals and my lack of enthusiasm for the school as the significant shortcoming of my essay.  Thus, it seems all inevitable and very likely that I am gonna hit the magic number "10" for the number of drafts before the R1 deadline.  Some of them made a good point that I should devote myself in illustrating why my careers goals make sense, why wharton, why now, etc. in a more extensive manner. Furthermore, the Wharton #1 is not to provide what you did in your professional working experiences, rather the essay should serve as the medium to give brieft overview of what you learned through the experiences.  From strategic point of view, they all stress the same thing. Distinguish myself from the rest of pack, by heavily emphasizing the detailed plan of my career goals, incorporating the unique characteristics of each school.  I am just awed by some of the advice, since it really opened my insights as to certain approaches required to draft essays. How much I know at this points far exceed how much I knew just a couple of days ago.  Many people are still concerned about their GMAT scores, GPAs, and other stats. However, I am slowing realizing the fact that a clear and feasible vision in your essays can picture you as a compelling candidate in a true sense. And I hope that fellow MBA bloggers take this very seriously.  For instance, let's look at this stat from last year applicants in Korea. (I found this from website) The list shows the stats of the applicants who were invited to Wharton last year. (For your information, Wharton interview 50% of the applicants, from which they select 30~35% for the class.)  Disclaimer: Koreans are sterotyped for their passive, less enthusiastic approach to classroom discussion and their preferance to only hanging out with their countrymen. In other words, they must have some compelling academic profiles in order to warrant an interview, since the streotypical behavior patters of Korean students often put them at disadvantage, against fellow Americans.  (GMAT, GPA, TOEFL, # of Years)  660, 3.1, 273, 13 680, 3.1, 250, 10 690, 3.4, 260, 6 700, 3.27, 270, 3 700, 3.6, 267, 5 710, 3.3, 263, 5 710, 3.2, 267, 7 710, 3.5, 280, 5 710, 3.1, 260, 3 720, 3.0, 277, 3 740, 3.1, 277, 4 740, 2.9, 263, 5 760, 3.0, 280, 5  Thus, from this shortlist, we can easily conclude that while GMAT score is somewhat consistent overall with the range of 690~760 for the most part, the wide range of GPAs suggest that Wharton is clearly more focused on people with professional achievements and growth than with cum laude notation on their transcripts. I am really shocked at this finding, given the logical notion that Korean students should have more impressive academic profile to compete against Americans who graduated from US undergraduates. After all, Korean students have not demonstrated that they can communicate with fellow students during classroom discussion. From what I hear, Columbia heavily relies on interview to gauge the applicant's communication skills, and Columbia has stated in the past that they will not admit Korean students without an intensive interview.
