       I have a friend who has a friend ...  My friend is an atheist. His friend is a Christian of the literalist variety. He, the atheist, and she, the Christian, appear to have a close, loving friendship.  I once asked my friend if his friend ever proselytized to him. He said, "No, she respects me to much to do that."  This answer, while it didn't surprise me, still baffles me.  My wife, who was with us for this conversation, agreed with my friend: his friend was being respectful by not preaching her religion to him.  So I asked, if he were practicing unsafe sex, and if she had reason to believe he'd thereby contract a deadly disease, would it be respectful to keep her concerns to herself? They agreed with me that it wouldn't be. They even agreed that she would be neglectful as a friend to just let him destroy himself that way.  So why didn't they make the same move with his eternal soul that they made with his mortal life?  Don't get me wrong! I don't worry for my atheist friend's immortal soul. I'm not a believer in Christ or Jehovah or any version of an afterlife -- I don't believe in immortal souls. I'm closer to my friend's atheism than I am to his friend's Christian literalism. But that's beside the point. If she believes in Hell, then I would want her to try to keep her friends and loved ones out of the place.  Should she pester him about the afterlife? No. I also don't think she'd be right to pester him about his sexual practices if his (hypothetical) risky behavior were at issue. I'm not advocating nagging in either case.  But why do non-believers have such a hard time taking seriously the beliefs of the believers? I don't mean that agnostics and atheists should suddenly become Biblical literalists; I mean that non-believers should be capable of following the literalist logic of believers, especially believers they care about.  At some other point, I'll give other examples of this problem with the moral imagination of my fellow non-believers, but meanwhile I wanted to point to a Gary North article from a couple years back on why American Christian fundamentalists don't proselytize to Israeli Jews. (Hint: it's not out of respect!)  While I'm at it, I'll also throw in a Wiccan(/witch)'s advice on how Christians can respectfully preach to pagans.  ---cut here---   "The Unannounced Reason Behind American Fundamentalism's Support for the State of Israel" by Gary North --   urlLink http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/north7.html   "How to Share the Gospel With Pagans" by Gwydion --  urlLink http://www.homestead.com/barbooch/Gospel.html

           Game Rules   Politics is a zero-sum game: for anything won, there must be something lost.  The market (i.e., voluntary exchange) is a positive-sum game: every voluntary player wins.         Game Rules Revisited   The Market is a positive-sum game (winners and winners) that is usually thought of as a zero-sum game  (winners and losers).   Politics is a negative-sum game (losers and losers) that is talked about as a positive-sum game, while generally believed to be a zero-sum game.

       There seem to be three distinct approaches to taking a position. I sometimes call these the    3 'P's -- principle, practical, persuasion      -- and sometimes the         3 'E's -- ethics, economics, emotions.  The first-tier approach is for those of us who believe the ends can't justify the means. The second-tier approach is for people who not only say that they are results-oriented, but who actually mean it! The third-tier is for everyone else -- it is the realm of both the a-rational and the irrational.  The only necessary argument for liberty is the ethical, first-tier argument: The  urlLink Non-Aggression Principle : "No one has the right, under any circumstances, to initiate force against another human being, nor to delegate its initiation." -- L. Neil Smith   But I've never managed to bring anyone over to  urlLink libertarianism  with a first-tier, ethical appeal to principle.   For almost anyone I've ever talked to,     the ends justify the means  ! As H.A. Scott Trask  urlLink says , "Americans are quick to deny the ethical legitimacy of this doctrine when it is presented to them as a naked proposition, yet there is no doctrine that they more readily turn to in order to justify morally questionable practices."  So, sadly, I turned to the study of economics and game theory a year or two ago, to learn more about the practical realm of the second-tier. (I say "sadly" because the move from first- to second-tier was an emotional defeat, but I am, in fact,    very   happy to have discovered  urlLink economics !)   Not all second-tier arguments would be recognized as "economic" by most people, which is why I also describe E2/P2 as    practical  ,   strategic  ,   utilitarian   and   consequentialist  .  The third-tier is where most people really choose their positions, but I don't have the strength to address that here and now. I've written a piece on the 3 'E's of the Minimum Wage, and I will post a link when and if I get it published. [ urlLink update ]   Meanwhile, I highly recommend these two second-tier arguments for liberty, both published today at  urlLink LewRockwell.com :          urlLink   Those                                  Good Old Days     , by Gary North. The pattern behind what gets better and what gets worse over time.         urlLink   Don't                                  Vote   , by Bretigne Shaffer.     So-called  urlLink liberals  (left-wing social democrats) are naive to think you can have a Welfare State without the Warfare State.

      Once upon a time, I had a friend who dreaded freedom.  That doesn't mean he wanted to be a slave, with all his decisions made for him and probably to his disadvantage, but he preferred the idea of a universe with limited options and one correct path. Like a multiple choice test with only A, B, C, and D to choose from. Where I was always talking about generating  more  options, generating an abundance of options, he saw such an abundance as reducing his chances of picking the one correct path. Rules were good. The more the better. The more rules, the fewer options.  This cartoon reminds me of him.    urlLink     urlLink  Click to Enlarge

      Somewhere or other I've claimed that one's understanding of minimum wage law is a good litmus test for economic (il)literacy. Here I will claim that the belief that we can have a Welfare State without the Warfare State is a a sure sign of political illiteracy. This is a practical point ( urlLink E2/P2 ); there are those of us whose objections to the Welfare State are principled ( urlLink E1/P1 ) but people seem unmoved by ethical arguments, so instead I emphasize consequences: welfare leads to warfare and vice versa.  urlLink      urlLink     ( urlLink Click to Enlarge. )

       The Bank of the United States was established in Philadelphia in 1791. By the 20th century the bank was one of the most important in the country. In 1930 rumours began to circulate that the bank was in trouble. On the 7th December long queues began forming outside the bank's branches. Over the next four days depositors took out $20 million from the bank. On the 11th December, all its branches closed, as the bank no longer had any money to give back to its customers. It was the most disastrous failure in the banking history of the United States. Investigators discovered that the bank's owners had been guilty of incompetence and three of them,  B. K. Marcus , Saul Singer and Herbert Singer, were sentenced to terms in Sing Sing Prison.    urlLink       urlLink

      I received the following feedback on my  urlLink TLE  minimum wage  urlLink article .  Greetings bkMarcus,  I enjoyed reading your article about the minimum wage in TLE's 8/8/04 edition.  While discussing the minimum wage laws with people, I have found that including an example is an excellent way to get the point across.  Here is the one that I use:  Suppose that I own a company that ships boxes of goods. Within my company, I have a group of employees who physically pack the boxes. Based on the cost that I charge my customers, I have determined that I can pay $1 per box packed. Some of my employees pack very fast (say 30 per hour) so I pay them more than others who can only pack 10 per hour. When a new employee starts, he might only be able to pack 5 per hour. As he gains experience, he will become a better worker and might eventually become one of my 30 per hour employees.  But here's where the minimum wage laws come into effect. If the minimum wage is raised to $6 per hour, should I pay my 5 box per hour more than the work he has provided for me? Would that be a good business decision? Or am I better off only hiring people who can pack at least 6 boxes per hour? What happens when the minimum wage is upped to $10 per hour? It would be in my best interest to clear my staff of anyone packing less than 10 boxes per hour.  The case of a new employee I would hire who can do 5 boxes per hour will never be given an opportunity at my company; it is not in my best interest to pay him twice his worth (through the fault of the mandatory minimum wage). Because I don't hire him, he will never be given the opportunity to increase his skill and get paid well above the minimum wage.  In the case of my shipping business (which can be applied to any business), the minimum wage laws have hurt the very people they are designed to protect. Instead of earning $5 per hour and being a productive member of society, my former employee is now unemployed.  How is this a good thing? To which I replied:  What I like about your example is that it explicitly ties remuneration to productivity, which is of course the point most supporters miss. Paying by the box is more concrete than paying by the hour. Unfortunately, even this simple example requires a basic level of business literacy that I'm afraid too few people seem to grasp. Explaining minimum wage law and price fixing to someone who actually deals with profit and loss is much easier than it is to explain such things to students, academics, minor bureaucrats, so-called "public sector" workers, etc. Even cubicle workers in a large enough corporate hierarchy are divorced from the basic issues of productivity. Money has become so abstracted for them that it becomes an arbitrary form of symbol manipulation, no longer grounded to the creation of goods and services. This is, of course, no accident. If more people had even the basics of economic literacy, we'd live in a very different world -- one in which the government would get away with much less. Economic illiteracy is therefore in the interest of the ruling classes.

       From a recent email from an old friend:   Someone I work with told me that there was a very high-profile stage production of The Sound of Music in the 1960s, for which the director wanted to release a flock of birds at the end of the song "Climb Ev'ry Mountain," when the soprano hits the climactic final high note. Unfortunately the set designers and production team placed the holding cage for the birds too high up and too close to the hot lights, and the birds were broiled. When the soprano hit the high note at the end of the song and the backstage crew pulled the cord to open the cage, instead of taking flight, hundreds of dead birds free-fell in a heap onto the middle of the stage.

      I have a once-shattered hip now being held together by plates and screws. I'm told that I will eventually need at least one hip replacement.    Walter Williams, in the article  urlLink I cited earlier , says that Canadian "hip-replacement patients often end up non-ambulatory while waiting an average of 20 weeks for the procedure, and that's after having waited 13 weeks just to see the specialist. The wait to get diagnostic scans followed by the wait for the radiologist to read them just might explain why Cleveland, Ohio, has become Canada's hip-replacement center."  So this aspect of socialized medicine strikes a personal chord with me.  Here's a comic strip that might be based on "a December 2003 story by Kerri Houston for the Frontiers of Freedom Institute titled 'Access Denied: Canada's Healthcare System Turns Patients into Victims'," [ urlLink PDF ] but is more likely based on the  urlLink same Walter Williams article  I've already pointed to.  urlLink      urlLink    ( urlLink Click to Enlarge )

      We are moving this week, which makes it hard to do much of anything else.  Fortunately, I have DSL at both ends of the move, but unfortunately, I have little time at either end.  Since I can't do much of my own writing this month, I'll try to put up pointers to other people's good works.  I'll start with Walter Williams on socialized medicine. I like his ending so much that I'm going to blow it right here. But do read  urlLink the whole article  anyway.     Health care can have a zero price to the user, but that doesn't mean it's free or has a zero cost. The problem with a good or service having a zero price is that demand is going to exceed supply. When price isn't allowed to make demand equal supply, other measures must be taken. One way to distribute the demand over a given supply is through queuing -- making people wait. Another way is to have a medical czar who decides who is eligible, under what conditions, for a particular procedure -- for example, no hip replacement or renal dialysis for people over 70 or no heart transplants for smokers.           I'm wondering just how many Americans would like Canada's long waiting lists, medical czars deciding what treatments we get and an exodus of doctors.    My favorite economics writing is that which uses the most basic supply&amp;demand rules to say things most people don't find obvious.  I'm contemplating writing a booklet on Gilligan's Island Economics -- something small, maybe $1 or $2 -- that would at least introduce people to the most basic economic literacy.

      I don't remember who it was who introduced me to the idea of one-handed typing. (No, not  that  sort of one-handed typing!) If you know how to touch-type, you know that certain letters belong to the left hand and certain letters belong to the right hand. Maybe it was Andrei  urlLink Codrescu  on  urlLink NPR  who did a piece on this idea. Talking about which entire words could be done with left-handed letters or right-handed letters. One of the jokes I remember from the commentary is that "Jimmy" is on the right while "Carter" is on the left, and that was the problem with the president himself. (Touch-type those names and you'll get the point.) Codrescu, if it was him, did this bit back in the 1980s.

      Do you get the difference between  irrational  and  a-rational ?  Something is a-rational if it is outside the realm of reason. Feeling happy or sad is neither rational nor irrational. My preference for vanilla over chocolate is not a rational preference, nor is it an irrational preference. It has nothing to do with rationality at all. It is a-rational.  How about the difference between  immoral  and  amoral ? I too often hear people use the latter as if it's a $10 version of the former, but it's the same distinction. Something is amoral if it is outside the realm of morality. Something is immoral if it is part of the good-versus-bad universe and it comes down on the side of bad. The tornado that destroys your house is amoral. The  urlLink person  who  urlLink initiates force  is immoral.  Got the distinction?  A belief system that neither includes nor excludes the existence of God or gods is technically atheistic. Pure Buddhism is, in this sense, an atheistic religion. The Buddhist nun, Pema Chodron, uses the term "non-theistic" to communicate this concept because everyone thinks "atheistic" means "anti-theistic".   The difference between theism and non-theism is not whether one does or does not believe in God. It is an issue that applies to everyone, including Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Theism is a deep-seated conviction that there's some hand to hold: if we just do the right things, someone will appreciate us and take care of us ... From this point of view, theism is an addiction. We're all addicted to hope... Non-theism is relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of the present moment without reaching for anything to protect ourselves ... In a non-theistic state of mind, abandoning hope is an affirmation, the beginning of the beginning.     -- Pema Chodron,  urlLink Hopelessness and Death

I started out doing something similar with the  urlLink Mises feed : playing the lectures on power speakers while I assembled shelves and unpacked boxes of books, but by the second half of  urlLink Hans-Hermann Hoppe 's introduction to Praxeology, I have to admit, there was something compelling about sitting still and just watching the lecture on my powerbook, where I could have (but didn't) take notes, check references, look up words, etc. (Hoppe introduces Praxeology at most of the Mises University summer sessions, but I found this year's particularly good. He gave historical background, political implications, and a philosophical refutation of positivism.)  Here's what North has to say on how the internet will impact 21st-century education:   urlLink The Coming Breakdown of the Academic Cartel   And here's a longer version he makes available in an email report:   urlLink Never Pay Retail for a College Education   North is especially good on the cartel economics of the university system.

       My   beautiful wife   and I are in separate states tonight. (I don't mean like the state of fatigue and the state of inebriation: I mean like the state of Kentucky and the state of Pennsylvania -- or are they commonwealths?)    We spent more than half the time apart last year, so you'd think I'd be used to it, but this is the first time this summer and I miss her.     She loves   urlLink Non Sequitur      by Wiley Miller. Like   Boondocks  , which she also loves, it is  stupidly interventionist on some basic economic issues -- but who isn't these days? Still, there's some real intelligence behind both those strips.    My   homepage   randomly includes comic strips from my  urlLink collection of favorites . It's full of Boondocks. Non Sequitur is starting to catch up. Here are a couple of recent ones I quite liked.
