      Hidden layers, peeling off, untold players, subtle soft. And round the world we start to dance, And in the back we hear the trance, We duel with death and things much worse to our role, And focus on a labyrinth so that we do not lose control.  ============================================ Though time with silver locks adorn'd his head Erect his gesture yet, and firm his tread His seemly beard, to grace his form bestow'd Descending decent, on his bosom flow'd; His robe of pursest white, though rudly joind Yet showed an emblem of the purest mind....  ============================================= "Exercise in Metric Interuption" by Lukas Driamusek  Simply put, enough was said, to bring you back to life from rest, to turn back time and raise the dead, the sun set in the east, not west.  And all I want, if it at all could ever bring me peace at last, to hear your cel'styne voice again, and live forever in the past.  But now I wander listless streets, With ash and sand around my feet, and though I never will accept defeat. Things will remain incomplete. and jarringly ruined.  ------ "A Problem a Friend Once Needed Help Solving" by Lukashi Driamusek  Oh what is art?  She did enquire... A flavored word, or lyric fire? A high burlesque, or sorrowed note, A thick string bowed, or poem wrote?  The answer lies in who-knows-where: It has to do with what we dare. The question be, to those who see, Is how our art does make us free.  Each rhythmic beat is simple math, Predictable perhaps as Krath, Yet travels far to spread the word, Of life, and love, and loss unheard.  And like an old friend newly met, It's something that we can't forget Thus thirstily we crave for more, Until it's all been done before.  And when it has at last been said... We all will lie forgotten, dead.  ================================================ "Restated Metric Verse"  How foolish of us, to not think it the same With history repeating again and again So mote it be that with time dulls the pain What has been shall be, and will be again.  A rose is a rose still by any old name The path of the righteous is the road of the sane The footsteps that follow shall always remain What has been shall be, and will be again.  Long since its breaking has my heart been tame A pulse and a life have been long to regain Once fixed, only to be broken again, What has been shall be, and will be again, It's always been this, and forever the same.  ================================================  "Three Rhyming Couplets, Times Four" by Lukashi Driamusek  On seventeen to lines by twelve  into our minds alike we delve,  for just as stars, with shadowed light, etch sweet runes across the night, so does word craft fill a room, lifting dread or raining gloom.  While colleagues sit in silence thick, and away the hourglass does slip, to reverse soon, begin anew, I try to puzzle my way through, another line, another rhyme, another tempo, beat or time.  Mathematically bound, lyrical lips searching for sound, and up they spring a well of thought by thirsty minds. With coin are bought, truth and fiction slant and leaning, hungrily they pick at meaning.  But meaning lies not in the word, not in the rhythm that is heard, nor in symbols that are shared, it lies where looking, no one cared, inside a heart not in a mind, is where a treasure you will find. ================================================ Seems I must revise my last soliloqy, and make the meter slightly more precise. If you should on the morrow like some tea, meeting Lukas in the Circle would be nice.  ================================================= Year 10. The 184th day of the Descending Sun.  As I sit here with you, I understand what I must do, To win our way above the blasted sands, And hear me now, as I do pledge, as eyes and ears and privilage, To serve you best, in all the lands. And so my goblet sits empty, As you listen quietly, I twist my tongue softly to the air. If you had not chosen I, I might entertained a cry, Though I do not know if I'd have dared. For a man once looked past Though his ego be quite vast Surely twice is not a blow that I could last. In summary I'd like to say, that for you now my lips shall play, and may our days together, be the greatest pleasure, and lighten our hearts from day to day.   ================================================= "Zelafin's Address to Poets Circle"  (Zelafin stands upon a woodpile to address master and apprentice alike, the crowd some hundred strong and after a moment, the excited mass quietens)  Today is Ocandra and we gather here this morning, free to voice and to listen to words that have been locked by the chains of oppression inside of us for two generations. Many friends have we, whose words we now shall never know, whose ears shall never hear us celeberate their memories, whose eyes shall never see us come together, as we do now. They sacrificed themselves in order that the people might hear their messages of dissent, and hope, when they were needed most.   Yet, they are here, amongst us, today.   Some of these friends, disappeared, some never completing their missions of rebellion, insurrection, sabotage and other secret errands, without which, we surely would have failed.   (at this point, Zelaphin chokes, moved too heavily by emotion, and tears flow down her cheeks)  Yet, they are here, amongst us, today. And all shall hear them, when they listen.   (as her loud, quivering voice rises as if in anger to combat a deep sadness that wrestles for control)  As the cries of battle dim across our lands, a New Poets' Circle will pulse with life; the healthy, beating heart of a free North whose rhythm shall haunt our oppressors for all eternity.   (raising her voice a bit, collecting herself and motioning to silence the beginnings of applause, which quickly stills as she continues)  Please! I ask you all to still your applause, to remain silent. The show is far from over. Listen! Hear the subtle rhythm of our future, and let it guide your spirit, in His Radiance, as we play on.   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome home.  (the crowd, many hanging their heads and struck deeply and profoundly by Master Zelafin's words, lingers briefly, and then scatters off to assist in celebrations of victory that continue elsewhere in Gol Krathu)   ================================================= "Tektolnes"  Once, his dark and ruined hands, held their grip over our lands, curled fingers crooked to squeeze. Feeding off life as he pleased, to sate his infinite thirst for power, which torments him endlessly at every hour.  They say he is the serpent-king, transformed into some vile thing, and that the ageless man is never seen: that he has never taken any queen. In a black tower sitting all alone, a shattered dream, on a crumbling throne, is Tektolnes.   ------ "Some Thoughts Amidst a Crowded Street" composed by Lukashi Driamusek  Twisting patterns of tempestuous people, Strong and weak and bold and feeble, Swirl about along their paths and routine ways, And amongst them I spend my days.  And alone I break every rule I know, Bend to the ebb of fate and flow, Though every dream of this machine is flawed, I seem alone to think it odd.  So above the crowd my gaze did slowly lift And saw an ivory pyramid. I wondered if someone inside knew my mind, and there, might, someday, wisdom find.  Or was it too bold of me to hold the thought, that despite the things I was taught, the world is far more than it first did seem; that life I hoped to lead, a dream.  Damn my fortune, damn every league of these lands! Yes, damn to drov these blasted sands! They've harried me at every wrestled step taken In a life long left forsaken.  If somehow I could find a way out of here, Out of this body that is dear, Out of my mind! (For I think that is the case), I might with hope my loss replace.  For as my friend Holten once advised to me, "We -cannot- let what's gone by be." And with his statement I sadly must agree, For it is by holding on that we can only ever truly see. =================================================  I fell down one day from a distant star come back to the plains where I lived before And the wind blew me across the grass as I looked for something to abate my sense of loss  oh come back to me, my dear you're the only other reason that I came back here oh come back to me, my dear help me wash away the meaninglessness I found here  I feel the sunlight pounding on my face roaming free across the sands once made my heart race a wilting flower in the shade of the shield wall and a whispered moment of regret before my fall  oh come back to me, my dear you were the only other reason I came back here oh come back to me, my dear help me wash away the emptiness that I found here  And as we sail through the air once again We vow never to return to a life of pain As the ground rushes up from below I'll feel the freedom return if I just let go So... close your eyes and I'll close my eyes And someday where the grass is green and life is good or so it seems the sky above not stained with blood the waters pour down in a flood  I'll meet you then, we'll live again, and someday soon blossoms will bloom  just come back to me, don't fear just come back to me, my dear  ------  "Light is Dark" Originally composed by Jalaya Orlani of the Konviwedu Circle.   "Just who am I behind this door, a whisper soft upon the air?" "A frame of light, or hole of dark - my darling sweet, you're unaware!" "Your eyes are shut and cannot see the shape of blurred intensity." "So dull, your vision is to everything that you and I could be."  "Apart from you I am alone, but there I can conceal myself.." "I sit and wait... I'm poised to move...a marble set upon a shelf." "A gentle nudge and I will roll, upon the sands towards the silt.." "Into my chest, a dagger planted deep from jagged blade to hilt."  "The sand about will bathe in blood so deeply red it shines of fire.." "And from this place I'll float away, but still the living I'll admire." "The game I do not play - I am a pawn that sits upon a board.." "But games must end, as music does: the final striking of a chord." ------  Sunlight and sands may you hear me call into the wind or hear me not at all be my nightly vice or set me free! while you're alive, I can never find my peace. and my thirst will never cease   ------ "Cavilish, written on a banknote" Composed by Ceridwen Irofel.  Well worth thy power, thou cursed leaf! Foul source of all my woe and grief! For lack of thee Ive lost my lass.. For lack of thee I scrounge my glass! I see the children of affliction, unaided though thy cursed restriction! I've seen oppressors cruel smile, amid his hapless victims spoil.. And for thy potence I've vainly wished, to crush the villains in the dust; Yet, for lack of thee I'm all but poor! I'm happy. I would ask no more.   -------------------- You know times must be tough when a little girl gets her hand cut off for stealin' waaaater. She had pale-blue eyes that were much to dry to cry when the templars cauuuught her.  And I keep saying stay a while behind me. I'll help you out in one more hour.  You said one day you'd come back home to your child and set out to roam in the saaaands, dear. And now your little girl's a'sittin and starvin and wishin' she had both'a her haaaands here.  And I keep preachin' stay a while behind me. I'll help you out just stay with me one more day?  She walks down the street and my heart skips a beat, and I know I'd love to hooooold her. It really stings that such a precious little thing's gonna never get much ooooolder.  And you hear me say stay a while behind me. I'll help you out just stay here for the year.  It's not quite true love, that with som coins in your glove ya know ya can woooooo this girl. But we walk hand in hand sometimes across his land and watch our liiiiives unnnfurl.  An' you say to me, I'll stay a while behind you. Cause baby I got nothin' left in this life else to do.  --------------------  Sing to me, you fallen dry-mouth'd bastards. Sing to me, and parch your mouth's a little fuckin' faster. You know right across the way's some water for you folk, Spillin' on the ground like some sick and twisted joke.  While you lay out here, you poor, thirsty shits, Trying to vainly beg for coin as you thirstily sit, You know right across the way's some water for you noble folk Spewin' in the air and on the ground like some sick and twisted joke.  Sing to me, that sound of rushing water crashing, Let me hear the drops fall by noble feet onto the ground, Steal a gourd and you get twenty fuckin' lashings, But don't and you'll be a shivelled mass of shit outside the temple when you're found.  --------------------  Below in the clamour of the crowded street, from that windswept sandy balcony I saw a sight that beckoned to my heart, scene shocked with gravity There a poor child desperately and frantically sought for a drop of water, scrap of food to fill her gut And what to do? for no one around seemed to see nor for her care nor feel the dust and silt the only reward for her frantic zeal with one last burst she shall collapse into the street and will be trodden on before my eyes by callous, crowded feet only paused beside to be looted by some other desperate souless sorrow by other hungry urchins, who of them, as I watched I wondered, will die tomorrow? -------------------- SIOBHAN If there is a way to say I'm sorry perhaps I'll stay another evening beside your door; And watch Lirathu rise inside your window - here jewels are falling, and flowers weeping, and strangers laughing and you are grieving that I have gone.  And if I do not know why I am going, perhaps I'll wait beside the pathway where no-one's coming. And count the questions I turned away from, or closed my eyes to or had no time for, or passed right over... Because the answers would shame my pride.  I have heard them say the word forever but I do not know if words have meaning when they are promised in fear of losing what can't be borrowed. Or lent in blindness, or blessed by pageantry, or sold by wily merchants while you and I are still walking our separate ways.  Sometimes we bind ourselves together and seldom know the harm in binding tha only feeling that cries for freedom. And needs unfolding and understanding and time for holding a simple mirror to the one reflection to call your own.  If there's an end to all our dreaming perhaps I'll go while you're still standing beside your door And I'll remember your hands enfolding a bowl  of moonstones; a lamp of childhood, a robe of roses - Because your sorrows  were still unborn.   At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her voice   falling into a sweetly flowing rhythm:      "Lirathu silvers the tops of trees, moonlight whitens the pymlithe shadowed wall; and through the evening fall, clearly, in echoing keys..."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her dainty   hand lifting and cupping as if to shape the words:      "Footsteps passing, an infinite distance away, in another world and another day."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, softly:      "Moonlight turns crimson roses blue, moonlight leaves the branches hoar   and old, and the boughs of pymlithe grow green and cold, our footsteps echo   on gleaming stones, the leaves are stirred to a jargon of muted tones."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her voice   hushing and fading:      "This is the night we have kept, you say: this is the moonlit night that   will never die. Through the grey streets our memories retain: let us go back   there again. "  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her   fingers fluttering up over her head:      "Dust goes up from the streets to dim the stars, the roads are black and   cold; so let us dance! To flare of horns, and clang of cymbals and drums..."   At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, a smile   widening on her face as she continues:      "And strew the glimmering floor with roses, and remember, while the rich   music yawns and closes, with a luxury of pain, how silence comes."   At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her voice   smooth as she sways in her seat:      "Yes, we loved each other, long ago; we moved like wind to a music's ebb   and flow. At a phrase from violins you closed your eyes, and smiled, and let   me lead you; how young we were."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, closing   her eyes for a long moment:      "Your hair, upon that music, seemed to stir. let us return there, let us   return, you and I; through changeless streets our memories retain: let us go   back again."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her eyes   flicking open to regard the dark-haired, diminutive templar and you with   their intense, almost molten silver hue:      "Dust goes up from the moonlit grass, and clings ghostly with light among   silvered pymlithe trees."   At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, extending   her dainty, gloved hand:      "We walk in silence and see how the moonlight flings fans of shadow upon   it the music's mournful pleas."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, continuing   softly:      "They die out behind us, the door is closed at last, and a net of silver   silence is softly cast over our thought. Slowly we walk, quietly with   delicious pause, we talk."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, with a   smile drifting over her features, carried in the silver tones of her speech:      "We speak of foolish trivial things; of life and death, time, and   forgetfulness, and dust and truth; roses and youth."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, leaning   forward, her eyes gleaming:      "You laugh, and I hear the after-taken breath, you darken your eyes and   turn away your head at something I have said, some intuition that flew too   deep, and struck a plageant chord."   At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, lifting   her hand to her lyre's strings to begin a fragile melody that weaves with the   words:      "Tonight, tonight you will remember it as you fall asleep. Your dream will   suddenly blossom with sharp delight, 'Goodnight!' You say."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, over the   softly-plucked chimes and tinkling notes:      "The leaves on lirathufavor dip and sway; the golden spikes of bloom nod   their sweetness upon us, lift again. Your face turns, and I am cought with   pain."  At your table, the delicate, nacreous-haired woman says in sirihish, her voice   hushing even lower:      "And silence descends, marked by the falling swish of sand from eaves and   jeweled points of leaves."    ================================================= "The Mindbender"  In the shadowed night, sometimes in the shadowed night, I become like spirit.  The walls, the bars, the gratings disolve into light. I become lost in Your music. I fly through the inner darkness, I fade, I become transparant, merely a specter.  A burnt dream singing as an echo of life.  I have no presence.  I have only past... and perhaps, a future?   Presence has left me, I'm left in nothing, an empty space... darkness.  Carve.  I must carve, myself a view out of the silence.  This steel box.   I will know the essence and the pain, of freedom.  I will be ordinary again. Yes ordinary.  That terrifying condition where all is a possibility.   Where a present exists... and must be faced.  Listen to me, listen, I am being your voice, hear me crying out of the wind! Hear me crying out of the silence.  I am the voice of your children, crying out to you from their unyielding silence. I am the voice of those now dead, their tragic tales stain the crimson sky. I am a chorus of breath... of water... of blood, hear us. Our 'evil' cry will not be still, we are your own mind calling to you. You are lost in your own voice, crying, unheard within you.  Let -my- unheard voice part your puzzled lips,  my gentle song spill forth, it's origin unheeded. Obey. Obey.  You are lost, you cannot be found, obey.   Speak, find my voice, for it is now your own. Your light has fallen and I will catch it.  The candle is snuffed and you have snuffed it... Like a burnt dream... singing... as an echo of life.

      You are my darling baby girl, Came back to see us on Tuesday. You were the mighty Aphrodite, and I your simple peasant muse. Away we go into the snow, a winter lifting from our hearts. What I wanted you to know, is you're my light within the dark.  And I... Would give... Anything to you for you to stay and never send your muse away, to always be there to softly call my name your love immortal not the same as any other girl I'll ever meet again.

      In silence sweet, we tred our feet, in sands on shores of time  seeing past the rhythmic beat and truly touching those we meet  is why our  ONLY  weapon is our rhyme.  But... as it's said, (or so I've read) "Words are Dozens by the Dime."

      Out of time, my mind: a quiver of hours, shooting stars at these unjust powers, and in blowing wind, fly overthorwing every rule that was before.  SO, now I've found that golden door, where nothing just as before is sure, save she, my muse, hears me and caring so much that my next words seem daring:  Her silkin hair, copper in the noonday sun. Her brown eyes glowing, showing her often to be risen high up above, like Valkyrie, as the turtle dove.

      A perfect sheet of satin cloth as white as gold Is stretched upon a subtly perfect circle frame. There are no angles like the knots of ancient lore, But yet it puzzles all the asking minds the same.  Fragility encased in something solid.  Pure. The strands of thought entwine around a vanished core That left its calculated essence all throughout The single fragments that my eyes do now explore.  A ripple starting from the edge appears upon The canvas of the mind, and spreads a shadow black As glass obscured by scratches and the shroud of time. A bomb that detonates and frees the mind of flak.  Alas, there is a  snap  and then the ripple fades To travel t'wards the middle faster than it came. It will not ever swim again upon the sheet But where it chose to die, a single thread became.  A thread that must be pulled because it simply is. The mind cannot ignore the fact that it exists. The longer that it comes undone, the more I see That just one thread is all of which the sheet consists.

      Tell it to the wind I'm stretching across the worlds My winter has come to an end And I have awakened The nights are no longer eternal The days have come alive I saw you there Smiling from afar  Long is the memory of trees They can see us anywhere we stand And they know why we are here Like a beacon in the fog I let my light shine upon you Because no matter where you are There I am  3/3/00  -Invisigoth

      The doctor's have all gone away,  we don't need them anymore. New York is our monument to god these days Teachers sometimes need a little fruit and Newton sat.  Adam was ignorant, ignorance is strength ignorance is bliss, ignorance is mindless. Eve was a real beauty, and clothing's just another way to express yourself lately. To communicate, to understand, to differentiate. Be red, be juicy. Learn, my friends, eat those forbidden apples, don't tell me you didn't know the name of That Fruit. You know everything now, you see through this shit. It's not 1984 anymore.  Happiness is slavery, so much greater when you're sad. So much more valuable when it's scarce. Who would rather be happy, and left in the dark, prey for someone who knows better, while you live an empty life and love it. Would you sacrifice understanding, for gaiety?  Honestly?  Choose bananas, choose the grape vine, but moreover, choose. Be free, take free things: got will? got milk? Fuck with the ghetto.  Simplicity is bliss, but complexity is beautiful.  Especially when you've figured things out.  Play chess. Play the guitar. Play on highways. Play with guns; Play.  I'm on top of my building now, just finishing up. I intend to try and write my name in the snow which is a good forty to fifty feet below. How do you like -them- apples?

      When angels know your name, that once you danced so well in combat along the shores of time,  wading down the pebble beach. It's nice to catch a game with a familar face   the land slowly turns to stone,  to sunlight on some broken husks of Babylon journey for a while with our fallen Valkyrie journey for a while together, earth and me journey for a time and don't worry about the sky changing from a rainy night to another cool day   speech is lost in wind along this pebble beach,  the battle maidens, spears raised high, and they are like angels when they know the name that once you danced so well   Come sons and daughters of my ancestors, ride heavy on your trusted steeds or run with powerful stride or flight of godly wings   like the swan or like the dragon swoop  over the crashing waves and mists of an eternity that defies clockwork, winding like smoke ever downward ever deeper into the great gravitational core of a galaxy where angels know your name.   and they, too, remember your passing into the tide to become lost upon the shores of another side they, too, wait for your return  you have forgotten them and misplaced the steps and tempo of the melody they cry but as each star springs slowly back to life In time you will regain  the familiar rhythm of a name that once you danced so well.

      How foolish of us, to not think it the same With history repeating again and again So mote it be that with time dulls the pain What has been shall be, and will be again.  A rose is a rose still by any old name The path of the righteous is the road of the sane The footsteps that follow shall always remain What has been shall be, and will be again.  Long since its breaking has my heart been tame A pulse and a life have been long to regain Once fixed, only to be broken again, What has been shall be, and will be again, It's always been this, and forever the same.

      Upon a time, and far away, In lands not of our own, There rose mountains into the sky That kings used as their throne  From one such mount a child was born; They said he was a sign  That their thrones would crumble to the ground And so they started crying  They wept because of what they knew: This child must be cast From their hall for safety’s sake If their mountains were to last  The child was therefor banished From his mountain home And for many a dark year afterward ‘Twas yonder he did roam  But one day that was doomed to come, The child ventured near The throne and mountains once his home; His destiny came clear  'I must conquer that mountain there,' He said unto himself, 'And rise until I’m at it’s peak, Or fail in my health.'  So up he rose the mountain side Much to the kings’ distress For no matter what they hurled at him His quest he’d not digress  Fire spilt and havoc reigned Down the mountains’ side; Lightning, thunder, tidal waves On the cliff face did collide  And once he’d scaled the highest peak, To his surprise he found The kings themselves had raged so hard; They’d smote it to the ground.

      I have been to three places  of significant note so far in my journey,  in the context in which I shall present.  They came as visions,  as realities  which struck home with the full weightiness of their potential truth.  They were each massive perspective shifts  which happened quickly  and had decisive affects on my altering my state of mind.  I have been to the realm of science the atheist's deepest realm The vision of another world came to me many years ago.  I was confronted by a universe formed by coincidence, where every question had an answer where life was fleeting, an insignificant struggle that ended no sooner than it had begun in the larger picture of Time.  I held this vision and accepted it as reality in its fullness.  For only a moment, this was real.  And then I could not breath. The vaccuum of space entire had entered my sanctuary.  I decided that day, within the core of myself that it could not be so. Every fiber of my being and mind dare I say soul screamed "NO!"   Yet I have also seen the end, as if in a dream, and cried tears both of Joy and of Sorrow.  Sorrow for my passing, and for the passing of those before me.  Joy at the absolute certainty that beyond death awaited a new realm of understanding, awaited a paradise on earth.  What I saw was a utopia of the soul.   But I have seen the husk of what is left behind in the aftermath, like shells scattered over the tumid shores of lifeless, dry salt.  I have heard the mechanical groan of the mundane in its most extreme, the high drone of the automation left in the wake of a soul's flight.  For once the soul has departed, there is nothing but madness to behold, and all the tongues of babel's fall become seperated, unique whispers, meaningless chattering on their keyboards with a backdrop of heavy silence.  There, everything is measured in grey. There, a second seemed like a day. I have only been there once, and I was afraid.

      A string of beads hangs lithely round your neck, slender lane of concrete sliding down your cheek. I remember when the workmen had grey slacks, now it seems the slope's too steep, the curve of your conscience too deep pounding in my head like church bells ringing backward, a feeling in my heart liquidating, overrated, till it's gone and contemplated.   Now I'm lost in the aisles, hallowed hollow pews empty like a strong shot of something seething down the glass.   Beads clatter to the floor, you're gone, stealthy little fuckers smoothly sliming their old ways down the streets, sweeping up the shattered tears as if they were diamonds, they'll bring them down to hell to be appraised. And after the demon jeweler has gazed he'll send them after me to wrench me more.   But babe, I've warded the door,  I've got symbols on the floor, pentagram's gone, key's no more.   Locked downtown in a wooden box, I'll be fine soon, smelt spring when I took a walk. Don't feel so lost today day by day I'm learning to find my way around this new place.

      The orange haze of twilight smog fills the ashphalt streets the potholes of a landscape broken in defeat a subtle rape of paradise moaning in protest old familiar patterns beating in her breast heavy sewer air fills the gutter now where once a river flowed a memory defiled pieces left, in safety stowed passengers and drivers both locked inside their cars burning fossil fuels do you remember stars?   a man in black down there a sidestreet of the mind take a step closer never look behind the tribes of babylon come together to build a machine to save the world to rise above the guilt the stifling UV rays scorching skin the terrible glacier of innovation within I once was young and I lost that to old patterns now afar once upon a time did you remember stars?

      Hopeless, my love, I wander the cold park trails wondering if you'll manifest there before me I don't see you, I can't tell your form in this world.   Hapless my love, I'm watching and waiting and calling your name, I knew it once many years past. I have this feeling.   You're out there somewhere,  but it's been many centuries now would I recognize your face, I think I know your eyes, they sparkle like something in the void of the sky.   Trailing, trailing: trailing like smoke and dancing around in the back of my mind. But I am cold here alone here.   Alone I carry a terrible burden  and I've been flooded, flooded with memories not my own. Sometimes I forget, the taste of your lips. The smell of your hair, the touch of your skin the sound of your voice.   If you... oh if you were to howl out in the street, broken defeat like shattered glass on the icy sidewalks giving up just for a moment the thought that I might find you, I might find you.   Do you exist still sometimes I ask, are you here this time around, in lives past we may've met,  but I don't know, now I don't know: I think we're nearing the end, nearing the end, fading in circles in clouds of smoke wafting softly into the sky the fire is waning inside my heart as the embers, these smouldering embers are fragments of what used to be...   I still think you might be somewhere, seems many centuries now I wonder would I recognize your face, I think I know your eyes, they sparkle like something in the void of the sky.   Like something in the void of the sky.

      As told by Angelika Mikhailova:  A man sets out to swim in the ocean and, before long, he swims out too far and the current starts to drag him under. He sees two sailors sitting on a bench on the shore, facing away from him.   He calls out in Russian - HELP. The sailors do not turn around.  He calls out in English - HELP. The sailors do not turn around.  He calls out in French - HELP. The sailors do not turn around.   He calls out in German, in Japanese, in Greek. Still, the sailors do not turn around.  The man drowns.  One of the sailors turns to the other and says:  "What a stupid fellow. Instead of spending all his time studying languages, he should have learnt how to swim".

      One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.   He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.   A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.   As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!   Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.                 Remember the five simple rules to be happy:                 1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.                 2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.                 3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.                 4. Give more.                 5. Expect less                 NOW --------                 Enough of that crap . .    The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.     MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:    When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass,  it always comes back to bite you.

      Alvin Toffler:      In  what  sense  do  you  copy  "the   conceived picture" of a novel?   Nabokov:      A  creative  writer  must study carefully the works of his rivals, including the Almighty.  He  must  possess  the  inborn capacity  not  only of recombining but of re-creating the given world. In order to do this adequately, avoiding duplication  of labor,   the   artist   should  know  the  given  world. Imagination without knowledge leads no farther  than  the  back yard of primitive art, the child's scrawl on the fence, and the crank's  message  in  the market place. Art is never simple. To return to my lecturing days: I  automatically  gave  low  marks when  a student used the dreadful phrase "sincere and simple"-- "Flaubert writes with  a  style  which  is  always  simple  and sincere"--  under  the  impression  that  this was the greatest compliment payable to prose or poetry. When I struck the phrase out, which I did with such rage in my pencil that it ripped the paper, the student complained that this was what  teachers  had always  taught  him: "Art is simple, art is sincere." Someday I must trace this vulgar absurdity to its source. A schoolmarm in Ohio? A progressive ass in New York? Because, of course, art at its greatest is fantastically deceitful and complex.

      Would I fall for you again, the way I would have done before? A choice that must be made anew, but you, this time, I don't adore. Free will, have I, to stand away and watch and wait as you ignore, The seething spear of metal dread that flies to pierce you to the core.  I cannot intervene this time; It's not my place, I'm not your knight. I do not  want  to put myself in front of that demonic flight. And if I did, by some mistake, decide to help you with your plight, I'd realise before it's done, that this is simply not my fight.

      I won't be leaving you 'till I believe in you my sweetheart I think you're doing just great  But haven't you slept today? Haven't you ate?  You may be a genius, you may be insane, My sweetheart I won't leave 'till you've given a name to your vision, your cause, your life long desire. I will never be leaving you ever again.  I won't believe in darkness nor in pain, My sweetheart you've got to believe that I'm true.  You've got to take care of yourself baby, okay? Don't be discouraged, we will never be through. That's a good thing, my sweety, a flame and a fire, inside our hearts, our minds, and our musical tunes. I will always be there, my sweety, with you!

      A Three pronged fork stretches skyward now, The sign against which demons fly, For, though scheming minds they may just be, They cannot seem to figure just how, To set these my weaves and dance awry, And get past my host of valkyrie.  Nine we are, where once was only three, And form slow webs of symbolic shields. We build together a pattern of mind: Once sung as silent soliloquy, Now felt farewell from once happy fields, And not a one has been left behind.  Drums we have, our runes upon them signed, And loud we play together these days. Our rhythm is what our hearts command. So beat we use to break from this bind, And dance and sing and speak the Fear away: Demons once fashioned by our own hand.  And far spread they have been in this land, for in every life you lived you were, at one point their unknowing smithy. In this age they do need heed command, And they haunt the world and torment Her, she who once was; must once more be free.

      An eerie, senseless brooding filters slowly into view. A sucking pit of empty dreams, too young to understand. A path that once was straight and firm, now twisted an askew, Is where I find myself this day, alone and without you.  This time was just a time was just a time, or so I thought. The minutes passed behind my back, too fast the ticking hand. Our morning walk disrupted with me there while you were not, But soon inside my fragile mind, a battle would be fought.  A wavelength flowing through the swaying pools of mindful force; Your soul, the center of your core, was ready to expand. A monster, of your blood, attacked your soul without remorse, And did this world crime by cutting you off from the source.  My waves can still connect; I am a bridge.  I am a plank. But where my bridge was to you then, is now a static blank.

      Revised mathematical solution to earlier discontinuity in proposed equation. ================================= Oh what is art?  She did enquire... A flavored word, or lyric fire? A high burlesque, or sorrowed note, A thick string bowed, or poem wrote?  The answer lies in who-knows-where: It has to do with what we dare. The question be, to those who see, Is how our art does make us free.  Each rhythmic beat is simple math, Predictable perhaps as Krath, Yet travels far to spread the word, Of life, and love, and loss unheard.  And like an old friend newly met, It's something that we can't forget Thus thirstily we crave for more, Until it's all been done before.  And when it has at last been said... We all will lie forgotten, dead.

      Oh what is art?  I must enquire... A flavored word, or lyric fire? A high burlesque, or sorrowed note, A thick string bowed, or poem wrote?  The answer lies in who-knows-where: A shrouded cave, a sunken lair. The question is, to those who know, The reason why our art doth grow.  Each rhythmic beat that comes from here, Escapes our hearts without a fear. And travels far to spread the word, Of life, and love, and loss unheard.  The journey ends where it began, From far and wide across the lan', Behind it all there is no more, Until it's all been done before.  And when it has at last been said... We all will lie forgotten, dead.  *     *     *  I'll not go into the specifics of what this poem means, though I do believe it is fairly obvious.  There is an updated version of it in existence, tweaked by a collaborator of mine, and I hope that it will be put up here shortly so that the kind of evolution of thought and communication of ideas we are trying to foster can be shown in a very real and comparable way.

      This is the first entry of the blog. You should read from here up. But it is only one entry point of many. This is a web of thoughts, a collaborative effort put forth by many minds, working together in a network to build a creation that follows a certain pattern which we feel within ourselves.   Let's see where this road takes us, if we follow the unspoken, hidden rules shared by every official collaborator.  Feel free to aid us, and post comments to critique and question the ideas we present.

      My silent screams permeate the tranquil night around me Stirring the waters that breed my tears The hands of time slow to a crawl, threatening to fall back once again I yearn so much, yet all I see are letters and words I reach out in vain, for my arms cannot stretch far enough All this, fueling the fire, which rages uncontrollably So I close my eyes, and the dreams still persist If I opened my eyes Would you be there? If I opened my arms Would you take that space beside me? And if I open my heart Would you fill the emptiness within?  1997&nbsp; (for Sean)

      "Kenaz, Mannaz, Dagaz"  The shadow across this void does flicker from beacons on the way left behind by ancient ones who passed here yesterday  In their wake I will walk down that familiar path of celestial academia of physics and of math  and all mankind's intelligence will gather on its horizons and with these fellow human beings I conduct my last liasons  For dawn is coming fast, my kin and so my mind awakens to light another fiery beacon on a path you have forsaken.  ========  He was a blue eyed boy  with a certain presence  when he stepped into the room.  But he's got a twisted sense  for recognizing what's behind  a cool demeanor.   Careless hair don't hide  the worries inside  cause he's been treading on thin ice  lately in his life.  Got knowledge of a lot of things,  but they're empty things.   Forget about what you think you know, about the machinations of your peers, or those unseen enemies  that hide behind a smile. He can see the contract in their eyes if only they could get him to sign away his soul it would all fall into place.  His worldview changes from day to day because it has to because the world has become surprising, to say the least  He thought he knew where the demons were, but now they're plaguing him. He wonders how many people have fallen into their thrall. And as he does his mind shies away.  ========  "Evenstone"  I'm a regular man, with a regular job: I go to school, I walk the dog. But every now and then you see  I'm evenstone I'm evenstone  I do not know how to create art, 'cos I've never had a broken heart. That's why often now and sometimes then  I'm evenstone I'm evenstone  I was walking along baby through the park And I saw the devil sitting in the dark He said how do you do, my lucky man  I'm evenstone I'm evenstone  I turned and ran the other way, but I couldn't seem to get away. For all my apathy, I know this day  is evenstone is evenstone  ========  "Void"   Hopeless, my love, I wander the cold park trails wondering if you'll manifest there before me I don't see you, I can't tell your form in this world.   Hapless my love, I'm watching and waiting and calling your name, I knew it once many years past. I have this feeling.   You're out there somewhere,  but it's been many centuries now would I recognize your face, I think I know your eyes, they sparkle like something in the void of the sky.   Trailing, trailing: trailing like smoke and dancing around in the back of my mind. But I am cold here alone here.  Sometimes I forget, the taste of your lips. The smell of your hair, the touch of your skin the sound of your voice.   If you... oh if you were to howl out in the street, broken defeat like shattered glass on the icy sidewalks giving up just for a moment the thought that I might find you, I might find you.   Do you exist still sometimes I ask, are you here this time around, in lives past we may've met,  but I don't know, now I don't know: I think we're nearing the end, nearing the end, fading in circles in clouds of smoke wafting softly into the sky the fire is waning inside my heart as the embers, these smouldering embers are fragments of what used to be...   I still think you might be somewhere, seems many centuries now I wonder would I recognize your face, I think I know your eyes, they sparkle like something in the void of the sky.   Like something in the void of the sky.  ========  Baby, I miss you, you have gone far now, far away under the pale blue moon. I look at the starlight, I gaze at the heavens, and wonder if that's where I'm going soon.  Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I have thoughts, that baby, really bring me down. So I hold my breath now, I'm going under, without ever making a sound.  Shock of the ice cold waters around me, glassy ice is cutting my skin. But I can't feel it, 'cos I've been numb now quite some time where to begin.  Baby can you see me, you feel so far, will I ever see you again. And if I did see you in the moonlight, would I be numb or would I be in pain.  Baby it's done now, I am so far now, I can see the moonlight through the waves. Waves left behind my hole in the ice from when I died the other day.  ========  The melody of silence if candles could sing this shadowy place would host an orchestra.  Smoke curls about my fingers, I pull it down into my lungs. The dragon within is sated as I spiral closer to death by the breath.  I once confronted that reptilian beast it led me on a sacred quest deep inside, where archetypes lie and demons rest.  Now here I sit, cloaked in a dream many moons have passed. And I am a man now, I passed the test that the divine ancestors laid before me.  But as the candles begin to wane, this silence starts to speak. And I know someday we'll meet again where each seperate star screams in defiance of the void within. Vainly trying to bring light to a sunless world.  The shadows engulf me, and what was once there curls slowly into memory.  ========  Shedding skin like a dragon in the spring. Eerie sounds within my scaled ears do ring. Pecking of the buzzards no longer part of pain, as i stretch my wings across the barren plain. The shadows of a giant scower silt and sand, depriving light of day and sun to this here slipping land.   And when high above I have you in my sights, And up you look to see a bird of prey, Remember me not for empassioned nights, But as a serpent that you summoned from the grave.  ========  "The Vision"  Upon a clifftop high into the the womb of the wind the chill brushes the sweeps of grass and behold! Below through the mists mills an ocean, punding relentlessly against the shores of time, rising above the wind its roar thunders once a common sound to these alien skies rusted from the blue grey to a crimson of blood. and as the sun rises, a sliver of energy ripples across the horizon of human potential, Alas, the shores are consumed and wane and wane, and not cliff, but at the bottom of what once sea,  staring into a small pool of salty human tears that slowly leaves its salt, and disappears.   ========  "Sept 8th 2002"  when I unplug my modem your digital siren's call ceases in the static of line noise. I have virtually returned to the 'real world' a world that is much more here than there with you in that comforting void of mind to mind protocol a realm of dualily and imagination, a flawless mirror floor.  I know nothing about where this place is. I only know where I am when I'm not there.  It's not beside the ocean, where the tumultous waves  crash violently upon the skyscraper rocks you rest on It's not once upon a forest, many blades of grass ago Just as I haven't seen where my food comes from ever in my life.  This is my call, unplugged, alone, dreaming of our void, it's lonely either way we sail. Our ship is breaking, thank you my dear I won't be the one to promise that we'll ever meet again some sunny day  Up above it oscillates shivers and fades quietly away.  ========  "Q4-B4-Z4"   A is for apples, that's what they used to say. But what is before, and what is being for? And if seeing is believing, then where has begone? I've only ever heard of delightfully disguised or decentralized.   Easy or Ici as the french like to say is actually all just about being free. Gee, we're getting off track now  and getting quite lame like an H. Whatever that is.   I can only imagine that I is for me, but if I is for me then how can I be? Be cause B is for Be and I am a Being, (one two many J's, they always, always, seem to say) is it just me? does that make all this okay?   I, me and she (elle en francais) mean this is all elementary or should be by the time we've spotted the enemy. No, no, not N, M, P! How many times do we have to go over it, L, M, N, O, P.  Oh goodness me, we're getting rather silly, these children always laugh and snicker at the alphabet by now. It's too long, it's quite a bore, they've left and must go pee. Just when we were getting toward the philosophy.   Q is for Cube, and that's all I can say, a mechanical puzzle that never will stop. Does it exist, well, are not you real? R is the measure we use to determine just that. S is re-port, an essay, (a try), that you're given  to prove that your point is all true, like T, T, to the tea, that's what you sit down and sip whilst you quietly contemplate U. V is for Victory, it means you have won, for now my dear sophist for now. W is the synthesis whereby you find yourself  sipping tea just across from yourself  Tea three, tea four, no more, no more. Except for the final excerpt. Examine the following expections I have of your answer to the excruciatingly difficult question I now pose.   Why?   Zed. Zed holds all the keys.   A is for Apples. B is for Be. C is for Cause. D is for Dead. E is for Ever.   But what doors are Z4?  ========  "Unplug"   Unplug unplug that's what we got for you that's the solution the only solution to your achy pain windows on the screen we lay forth here this conclusion to your polution But I can't I can't I won't unplug you can't  just do that motherfuck. Unplug unplug. Just unplug. Just turn your eyes away.   They don't get it, they'll never get it they  just won't get it, till their caskets are rotting They're coming back, we're all in this together sitting in this labyrinth together walking the steps like fingerprints on the other side of the screen.   Can't unplug won't ever unplug can't just do that can't just turn your eyes away. Just going to have to find the patterns, find the patterns that will make this madness go away. Make this madness go away.

If it's not then why'd I feel  trapped inside an aching heart  imprisoned in a holding cart  &nbsp;  And being dragged down sandy streets  And wondering when I might meet  the one who will make me complete  I think that'd&nbsp;be pretty neat..  &nbsp;  ========  What is Love?  ========  I can't say I've ever known  what love is truly, if it's real.  I can't say I've ever seen  a man and woman touch and feel  &nbsp;  I see couples all around  Love to them seems punctual  &nbsp;but to me all I perceive  are relationships, dysfunctional  &nbsp;  So what is Love? She asked to me  A cool breeze in the broken rim?  A moment in a quiet place?  Or is it only me and him?  &nbsp;  Love is fleeting at very best  for me that is since I'm a 'slut'  but that's unfair I just like love&nbsp; but I just keep my mouth tight shut.  &nbsp;  ========  I loved you once  ========  I loved you once or so I thought  I loved the things you for me bought  I loved the sweet words you dare  and your subtle fingers in my hair.  &nbsp;  I loved it when you did that thing  Even words that meant to sting  I seemed to love, yes, even them,  and come back to you over again.  &nbsp;  But when you hit me once that day  I knew I had to get away,  because that made me feel forsaken&nbsp; and your thoughts are quite mistaken  &nbsp;  I will come back with a fury  and you will feel my total wrath  like some fallen Avangeon  weilding fully the might of Krath  &nbsp;  Because no man is my master  No man owns my mind  Because any man who would do that  I  will  leave behind.

      She gently creeps in Surrounded by ethereal mist With a single candle in hand Her lips part to form a smile A warmth radiates from her green eyes Long, auburn tresses cascade over her shoulders Outlined by that black, flowing dress She glides over to his bed And wakes him with a gentle kiss He rubs the sleep from his eyes To behold this visitor Who nightly graces him with her presence As be beckons her into his welcoming arms She blows out the candle And sinks into his embrace &nbsp; 3/3/96

      My heart ceases to beat in your absence The tears long to fall, but refuse But I will not regret I don't completely understand this Something that brings so much happiness Is something that brings so much pain When we are together, I see nothing else And when we are apart, you are my only thought The fear that we may not always be Haunts me every now and then For you mean the world to me Losing you would be the greatest pain of all Unless, of course, your feelings would be the same &nbsp; There is pain in knowing There is pain in being loved You, my love You are my greatest sadness A paradox in itself And yet you keep me going Because there is still hope I cannot help but wish for the best But the fear won't leave me alone If the best is yet to come I will rejoice in the happiness it brings And live in bliss forever But if the best is now And lonliness is yet to come The memories of you and I will live on forever Especially one sweet reminder A little piece of you that remains And I will not regret &nbsp; You, my love, have invoked great emotion So much to transcend this forgone world And for that you will be loved forever O, my sadness O, my joy My nerves are shaking And the tears are spilling My heart and soul are yearning for you Calling out your name Screaming in agony Because you are not here by my side Oh, why are you so far away When you can be right here Because I need you so very much You, my comfort, you ease the pain The pain, which returns in your absence &nbsp; Until the next time We can be together I sit here in solitude Silently suffering and calling out to you I can only recall your warm embrace Waiting patiently for another opportunity Clinging dearly to the memories A pitiful soul am I Lost in my own thoughts Unable to focus on the rest of the world So turbulent, yet strangely at peace &nbsp; No one else seems to understand This that exists between us My greatest sadness My euphoric joy They cannot see what flows within my soul They do not look past the deceptive exterior Perhaps they do not know what it is Nor ever experienced it Maybe they never will They couldn't possibly know what it's like To be consumed by such great sadness And at the same time by immense happiness I could not tell them of my feelings Because they would laugh in my face And ridicule me for feeling this way For that reason, I sit here in silence Seeming to waste away &nbsp; But only you know And you alone understand Why I am so torn up inside While my composure remains unchanging There are times When I wish that I could show it So maybe it would be easier to cope &nbsp; 11/6/95 &nbsp;

      He sits, barely a foot away And he is all that I see Every fiber of my being cries out for his touch Yearning for the forbidden embrace The desire swells within me, a fire raging inside Quenched only by the fear that reigns &nbsp; 7/18/04&nbsp; (For Aalthei) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You linger in my dreams And haunt my deepest memories I can feel your soul calling out to me Lost in the seas of time I know you are out there Somewhere... I thought I had let you go Many years in the past But one of us has held too tightly What I wouldn't give To get rid of this obsession But your eyes won't let me forget &nbsp; 1/6/02

      The darkness beckons to me Bidding me to come into the endless sea of nothingness Tempting me with the sweet embrace of freedom As the light saps my strength &nbsp; (7/14/04) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Striding out onto the sunbaked concrete Behind this mask of confidence I hide Discarded, cast aside again Still I go back for more Nothing but another faceless number in the crowd &nbsp; (7/14/04) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here I sit, empty inside Pondering how to fill the void I scream, but no sound emerges Trapped, bound within the world I created I have so much, but feel so little I do so much, never for myself I yearn for peace, but am met by discord Forever fighting the unseen turmoil Trying not to keep looking back &nbsp; (7/12/04, for Aalthei) &nbsp;

      1   A Three pronged fork stretches skyward now,  The sign against which demons fly,  For, though scheming minds they may just be,  They cannot seem to figure just how,  To set these my weaves and dance awry,  And get past my host of valkyrie.   2   Nine we are, where once was only three,  And form slow webs of symbolic shields.  We build together a pattern of mind:  Once sung as silent soliloquy,  Now felt farewell from once happy fields,  And not a one has been left behind.   3   Drums we have, our runes upon them signed,  And loud we play together these days.  Our rhythm is what our hearts command.  So beat we use to break from this bind,  And dance and sing and speak the Fear away:  Demons once fashioned by our own hand.   4   And far spread they have been in this land,  for in every life you lived you were,  at one point, their unknowing smithy.  In this age they do need heed command,  And they haunt the world and torment Her,  she who once was; must once more be free.   5   It is of no princess I now speak,  but of our world and collective mind,  which needs protection more than I do.  But, forever which I sought to seek,  buried deep within my mind to find,  the questions to which answers aren't due.   6   For who are you, if not I am you?  The deep inside that radiates light,  The core to all that you might wonder,  Dreaped in not just white but also blue,  On this earth we have no will but Right  And naught makes our legions run assunder,   For we guard all things that are True.   7   Be wary when Fear leads you asquew,  Remember that I watch over ken,  The knowledge that's everywhere you look.  These days we are not many but few,  Walking shadows in ruins: old broken,  wrinkled, like an old, time-worn spellbook.   8   Infinite, timeless grace forsaken.  Harry all your foes with hidden might,  Your guardians, warrior maidens,  Make sure your demons are mistaken  when they try to bring you to Night,  you will instead find new safe havens.   9   And as you see the Fearful raven,  that Edgar Allen Poe one time write  Do not shake and shudder as did he  For fear is also just protection,  You find the power and you will smite  the demons and truly find simplicity.   You will find that you're a lot like me.

      Though the path is wet, the bench is not  so there I rest and can reflect &nbsp;and try to turn off my mind or leave it behind &nbsp;so that I might cease my creations and ask truly where I am? &nbsp; &nbsp;And pressed close as we dance  and guessing eachother's thoughts  &nbsp; and there is nothing else to be done &nbsp; &nbsp;a quiet moment passes me by like a forgotten lulliby  and words actually fail to describe what I feel  for no matter how I try I just cannot fully grasp that this is real  if only I could feel it, what is real, really feel,  I could perhaps say "I know some truth"  &nbsp; And I come close, pressed close,  and the silent minutes tick by  and the leaves of someone's book turn over. &nbsp;The wind is playing &nbsp;singing and playing  in my ear and in my hair  but I am never fully here,  nor am I ever fully there. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am always somewhere in between, &nbsp;on a winding stair.

      The weight of pounding love is heavy on my chest Like an anvil being  hammered from above. Like a herd of elephants trampling my soul. Like a sun ascending to  its supernova fate.  I can't help it - don't hate me. That will only make it worse.

      ======== A sort of farewell to thurisaz ===== I have your gods by my side I am a man of words please no more my love save me bring me my sword  For I'm going to war today  This may be my last time seeing your celestial face divine. The war is in my mind, and as it has been said, everything  everything is in your head, oh come now sit down, be at my side I don't know when I will return, I've come to say goodbye I've come to say farewell I'll see you in the sky or maybe I will see you again in hell.  For that may very well be where I'm going. Going. Gone.  ======== A song inside ======== It's all bits and pieces now, I was lost and never found, THe days tick by as a shuttered breath, inhale, exhale, and battle death.  Puzzles in my mind do scurry, and lead me to believe there's hurry to solve the mathemetics of it all I admit I have been seduced by the Call  The siren moans inside my soul, to come to her and make us whole, but all she does is make me sick, until my ship crashes as a wreck  upon tumid shores of that black river, whose ferryman will deny my toll, so that I sit upon the slag and shiver, and comtemplate the grace of my tragic fall.  ======== SLeep Denied ======== I am so god damn fucking tired, and yet I cannot sleep, There is a demon that I've hired, to make my thoughts be deep.  But as we''ve seen these passing days I cannot stop to take a simple breath, and restlessly I walk the road away, and fear the shadows coming at my death,  For what if in that deal my fragile soul, was truly given to the other side, and I, Iolo, the perfect genius fool, have even now just rrealized I died.  One more verse before I fail to leave, One more sweet word that savors love, one more thing inside my heart that I believe, Before helplessness will grieve and I will be recieved.  ======== On the power of a silent voice ======== I silence may we speak out loud  so that our true thoughts stay a cloud, but we can't hide them from our selves it all depends on where our mind dwells, but somewhere in the deepest spot, there is a quiet void without a thought to rest and repose our grand machination and sit and bask in contemplation.  And the more power I have the more I'm free the less it seems I really need to do those things I wonce held dear whose loss had been my greatest fear. And now I sit and can be quiet, And know with my voice, start a riot, For there's more power when you need it not. More freedom comes when it wasn't saught.  And thought this poem is on voice I've decided not to make a noise, for then I can with open ears find prophets, shamans, spirits, seers, and with them learn some long due wile, and sit back with a patient smile. For now I watch the rainy world turn around, hail and storm and slam against the ground.  ======== Soap ======== Truth will make you so unseen that they will wonder where you've been. Liberty, Justice these are prizes, and with them freedfom truly rises.  But we must move like subtle seasons, saying softly our secret song, and remembering the structure of our prisons, the cells we're in for doing nothing wrong.  And up she goes, thar' she blows, Breaking every rule she knows, leaving scars upon the winter snows, and crying icy tears everywhere she goes.  She's sad because a man like me does not exist. I am a fictional character, and although I persist, my blistered calloused feet have never known defeat, but I have often surrendered in time when I thought my prose where crime.  You see I am an idealist, an ideal man not a realist, And I refuse to give up my hope that we cannot clean up this world, even if all -I- do is sell soap.  ======== Laurel's Audience ======== She laughs and likes my poetry  because of all the imagery, The beautiful things I help her see, and induldges it with flattery.  But no poem I've yet written, has made me so truly smitten, as with this love bug I've been bitten, that turns the pair of us to kittens.  And just as a tiny kitten plays, to train to kill in cunning ways we laugh and chat the hours away as yesterday, again, in future days.  ======== An age of secrets ======== A quiet smile of whispered wills that like fog spread over hills, grass and root alike it sweeps, with a tiny series of silent peeps.  A secret in our day and age, sharper than a sword it's edge,  and cutting like a poet's pen, disarms the mind over again.  But in the age of information gossip, like rabbits' fornication, garbles words so that we're blind, and forget what we have left behind.  So clean your room and go to bed, because you really will not wake up dead, that when you sleep the dreams will come, and you'll find all your knots inside undone.  ======== In summary ======== A warm summer day did pass though showers sometimes came but never did they really last for in my heart the weather's tame  My voice is soft, my touch is gentle (Although some would call me mental) I saw today with a frightening clarity: Nothing.

      I dreamed a fine net so my vision could claim The breath of his being, the wealth of his name.  In long hours I wove it from midnight to day, As the weft of the air directed my way.  With stealth I proceeded, with guile my wit travelled Until all dark knots I had wholly unraveled.  Freed threads fell like down through the warm of the breeze While the Alder in safety was taking his ease--  Unwarded, unwitnessed, drowsing alone, Like a trout set for tickling beneath a dead stone.  Caught napping at noontide, unkeyed was his keeping: He unlocked his lips and spoke naked while sleeping-- Stripped as a sacrifice, naked as flame, Naked as hatred, I heard his true name--  A name to slice silence or sever strong rock, An unuttered tonguing, a hush like a shock.  Few list'ners could bide the brude stroke of that sign: &nbsp&nbsp&nbspKnowing was vict'ry--- &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd knowing was mine!

      Floating through the days They all become a blur And yet, they are crisp like mountain lakes Soft wildflower pedals Thick like iron And paradoxical, for I can only know this moment. Look, there it goes Into the past, as new moments dawn Should they be thought of And toiled over endlessly? The shape of existence The safety and recklessness of time Dwindle into some lost fragment That revolves around itself And perpetuates into eternity.

      Oh skulls never knew the horrors I knew When muttering muses whisper their names most haven't seen the things I do most haven't played the games I play.  For here it is an art in quiet summary of which you shall not see and heads not in the mood to buy it wherever a man shall not, I'll be.  My cloak is thick of needled ends whittled from the bark of dead and tentacles writhing round the bend the North Road's written up ahead.  Today was not the day I meant But tomorrow shan't be either The assassins -- other than I -- you sent all came down with a strange fever.  So in the weeks to come beware The food you drink, an airy breath for well you will do in such fare to contemplate your time of death.

      Peaceful bliss is what I've found, Inside myself and all around. A perfect, positive contagion, through observation, That lifts me up to endless heights And fights the thoughtful blights That haunt me.  The glowing beauty does not flaunt, Nor does it taunt the mind. It knows the hive inside, Because it is you, and it is I, And it is every kind.

      Cycles are the fruit of today, Refreshing the balance of life, And keeping us who we are. For what you receive in return, they say, Is more than what you put in, by far.

      Between the tempo of the living, And the fathoms of the giving, Breathless wonder often makes its lair.  High above it shows its faces, Drifting clouds through open spaces, Coyly letting sunlight fill the air.  Focus is the main attraction, Time succumbs to this subtraction, Pushing all the thoughts beyond the now.  Like silky smoke into the sky, To dull the blazing dragon's eye, The power of the stillness does endow.
