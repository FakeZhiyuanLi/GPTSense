      God as quoted by Mil Millington in  urlLink A Certain Chemistry :  There is another thing, though.  I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier, when I was dropping all the science on you and telling you the names of stuff.  But, well, I lost my nerve, you know?  One reason I lost it is that this word's no sweetheart to say, I can tell you.  Here goes..."phenylethylamine."  What did I tell you, eh?  Even your own scientists shorten it to PEA, so they won't keep screwing it up when they try to say it and making an ass of themselves during, I don't know, seminars or whatever.  But I got to admit, the length of it wasn't the only thing that stopped me.  Fact is, I'm a bit guilty about it.  PEA, you see, is a dirty trick.  Sure - like I've told you - I was worried you wouldn't get yourselves together, and that things would fizzle out 'cause of it, but PEA...well.  Okay, I'm just going to tell you straight out.  PEA kicks in when you're attracted to someone, and here's what it does: it stops you from seeing their faults.  PEA is, like, your actual rose-tinted glasses.  That's bad enough, right?  But then...Sorry.  Okay.  The length of time varies - it can be years - but after a while...it stops working.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not sure I'd have had the guts to tell you this if your scientists hadn't uncovered that bit of evidence already.  A dirty trick, like I say.  Worse still, a dirty trick badly done.  Let's just say I owe you one. This book isn't for everybody.  It's a touch slow in sections and if you don't like brit-wit, you'll hate it.  I really liked it though, and I think it's considerably better than his rookie effort,  urlLink Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About .  The book has a lot of interesting stuff to say, a great ending, and a laugh-out-loud-moments-to-pages ratio of about 1:5.

      I read  urlLink Bringing Down the House  yesterday on the way back from my first trip to Las Vegas (a four day mini-vacation with my girlfriend and her parents).  It's the story of six MIT students who - with the help of some silent backers - won millions of dollars playing blackjack between 1995 and 1999 using an intricate, team-based system of counting cards.  As you can imagine, the casinos were not exactly thrilled about this; most of them now employ techniques for catching people who use the MIT method.  However, I still think it might work if you played low limit tables and didn't draw too much attention to yourself with huge bets.  My girlfriend and her dad are big blackjack players, so maybe next time we're going to Vegas I'll practice counting for a few months and give it a shot with their help.  If nothing else, getting barred from a casino would be an interesting story.  Vegas, by the way, is a great deal of fun.  I had been to Atlantic City before and wasn't all that impressed, so I have to admit that I was a wee bit skeptical about this trip.  It didn't take Vegas long to win me over, though.  There's so much stuff to do even if you're not into gambling - just walking through the casinos and taking in all the extravagance ( urlLink a 54-foot exploding volcano outside of the Mirage ,  urlLink The Fountains of Bellagio ,  urlLink Siegfried and Roy's "Secret Garden" , etc.) is enough to keep you occupied for days.  I, however,  am  into gambling.  I ended up $70 down after a disastrous run of baccarat at The Barbary Coast on the last day of the trip, but up to that point I had broken even playing blackjack and spanish 21 and had won $150 at the roulette wheel by employing the risky  urlLink Martingale betting technique  (which is basically all psychological - roulette isn't subject to continuous probability so even after eight reds, the probability of another red hitting is still .474).  Oh well - as long as you come expecting to lose, casino gambling is a lot of fun.

      Heh, any guesses as to how long this will last? I tried keeping an analog journal one time, and I ended up writing all of one entry. Let me be perfectly clear: I have every intention of at least doubling that here.
