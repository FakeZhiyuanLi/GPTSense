      ...fearsome warriors from around the British isles were gathered for the greatest day of them all.  The stag day.   Here are all the photos from the Stag Day of  Sir Robert Wickins! . Held on Saturday July 17th in the Exeter ghetto.  There were some other pics but they didn't really come out very well so these are the best of the lot. If I get any others then i'll be sure to add them!  If any of the 'Stag Crew' want any copies let me know and i'll run off a batch!  Hope you all enjoy!  P.S. Apologies for the photos which are on their side, the hassle I had getting them all on here meant I was too lazy to turn them all right side up!!

      ... I just have to have a moan about  Kitten    urlLink     She comes across as someone who feels very insignificant in society and who has come into the Big Brother house in order to try and manipulate her new surroundings in order to reverse those roles. The fact that they are now all enclosed within the  'Big Brother bubble'  seems to be a key which Kitten feels that she will now become significant, and more in control.  Within 24 hours of being in the house she was openly discussing ideas of rebelling against the nomination process. Firstly, this seemed to be Kitten 'testing the water' to see how people would respond to her being dominant and dictating, and secondly, it seemed to be her openly displaying her inner worries about being unliked, still insignificant, even in the BB bubble, and therefore nominated. Another display of defiance, during the first nomination task, led to her being overlooked by Big Brother and unable to vote. I got the feeling she wanted Big Brother to keep pestering at her to get into the diary room. She look miffed when they moved straight on, and became rather introverted when it became clear that her wonderful rebellion was already beginning to backfire.  Continued acts of disrespect and defiance against Big Brother are always followed by tentative looks around at her fellow housemates, indicating a sense of wanting to be seen and to be accepted. Accepted not only as the dominant personality in the house but, primarily, accepted as a member of the house.  I believe she is genuinely worried that she is not going to last a few weeks, and the bravado she displays in her rebellion against dictating Big Brother is merely a sorry facade for her need to feel wanted and accepted.  We shall see!!

      He still annoys me, and he's still as arrogant as ever but BB5 participant  Victor  is still making me piss my pants! After his world record for fastest nomination (he nominated  Kitten  for the luggage deprival) he has subsequently come up with the years greatest quote.   urlLink     Discussing her mental state in the BB house he said she had  'as much stability as Rik Waller doing the Riverdance on a tea table '!!! Brilliant! Although very annoying, he'll be one I won't mind staying in the BB house!  Another one who is a possibility for staying longer is  Dan .   urlLink     There is definitely something there that he's not telling everyone, and he's looking less annoying than the rest of them at the moment! Plus! He looks rather like BB4 stalwart  Jon Tickle !!   But I'm still sticking with my final 3 !

      In typical fashion I spent Friday night screaming at the television screen, dismayed at the complete numptys that  Channel 4  have put in the   urlLink Big Brother   house. " Never before ", I wailed in dismay, " Have I seen such a bunch of obnoxious, intolerant and bloody annoying people in my life ". And therein lies the magic of BB, it gets people riled and gets them talking about it.  I know for a fact  Marco  is going to annoy the shit out of me, the minute he came on screen he was doing my head in! In fact nearly all of the housemates annoy the hell out of me, and the only three who don't are my predictions for the final 3.  First up is  Jason   urlLink      Next is  Shell    urlLink      And finally  Nadia   urlLink      Although credit has to go to  Victor  who, while everyone else took about 5 minutes to decide on their luggage nomination, took about 0.005 seconds to proclaim  Kitten  as the most undeserving and fucked in the head!    urlLink      And then promptly comforted her when the nomination was announced!  What a dude !

      As those of you who know me well will certainly testify, my monetary skills are rather poor.  Poor in that I am allergic to it. Not just allergic, but I'm phobic about the stuff.  Poor me. Put the stuff anywhere near me or my bank account and I become hysterical, resorting to spending it like a crazy fool in all good record stores.   The result? 700 CD's. No money!  This usually means that, each month, I take on the Mission Impossible of getting my rent in on time (rumour has it that Tom Cruise is basing the new MI3 film on me). This month I managed it, albeit 3 weeks late, and sat smugly knowing that another month could pass before the crazy charade continued.  However, dear folks, upon checking my balance I saw that TWO rent cheques had gone out of my account. One of these had the terrible misfortune of bouncing.  Today I have spent the morning attempting to find out where this extra cheque came from. The cheque, as far as I can work out, was written in December 2003. But the letting agency have no recollection of it, claim I am otherwise up-to-date with my rent, and reckon they only cashed one cheque!  I am truly baffled. The bank are getting a copy of the cheque so we can see who paid it in, the problem being that the cheque that bounced was the one the letting agency know they paid in.  So I am currently one month in arrears in the eyes of the letting agency. And one months rent money out of pocket but I don't know to who!!!   Anyway, the lovely ladies at the bank are 'on the case' and I've promised them that, should they solve this Agatha Christie-esque tale of murder and intrigue, I will buy them each a rose and serenade them in the bank!!  Updates as and when I hear anything!

      After the upset of breaking the bat there seemed only one thing left to do.  We stirred up the embers of the barbeque and sacrificed the bat handle and the bat.   urlLink     As any good Bush Tucker Man knows, the secret of a splendid fire is to start up a Rolf Harris tribute band. The generous billowing of the wibble board, and the cascading gusts of the Didgeridoo, allow for a fantastic fire!!  Can you guess what it is yet ?    urlLink     But this wasn't doing the job. Where there is smoke,  WE NEED FIRE ! Dave was summonsed to the garage to ' bring the lighter fluid '.    urlLink     As the flames began to grow we watched our signatures, signed at the beginning of this momentous occasion, begin to fade. The heat grew and the flames became towering furnaces of evil!    urlLink     The immense joy of being at one with natures most vicious tool soon turned to fear that we had actually set fire to Dan & Raynor's wooden pagoda. There was only one way to fight this potential for devastation, and that was to fight fire with fire! (well, more lighter fluid anyway!)    urlLink     After the towering inferno had begun to die down there was a fear that, as the bat was made of such quality timber (finest Peruvian balsa, so I'm led to believe), the heat would not sufficiently destroy the beast. Cue  Handy Andy , always ready for action with his power saw. He soon set about wounding the sturdy length, while admirably still finding time to keep drinking his beer!    urlLink     Disaster almost struck! In the excitement of decimating the bat, Dan sought to satisfy his hunger by eating one of the sausages from the barbeque. " No Dan, that's no sausage, that's a flaming bat handle! " We cried. Catastrophe averted, we set about crushing the ashen timber.    urlLink     The ashes were set upon by a pair of insatiable, devouring tongs. Although heartbreaking to do, it was a job that had to be done in order to allow us to bottle the sacred ashes.    urlLink     The careful funneling of the ashes into a Stella bottle ensured that we now had an ashen chalice, ready to be presented to next years winner of the  Annual Sudbrooke Ball Game Gala!  The world waits with baited breath!

      This post is dedicated to the soon to be married  Mr Robert Wickins , for whom it is my great pleasure to be best man for on August 7th 2004!!  Planning my best man speech is providing somewhat of a headache.  Having known Robert for the best part of 15 years I have accummulated a lot of wedding speech 'ammo' so to speak, with the obvious aim of embarrassing the young man!   From our first meeting at   urlLink Cub Scouts  , when I was present at Robert's famous declaration of dismay that his mum wouldn't let him have a mohican haircut! Oh yes, times were hard in Colyton in 1989! Through many a drunken escapade in and out of the pubs of East Devon I have been privileged to be accompanied by such an expert in the art of daring and sick-pile making.   However, the best man speech is not my only problem. There is the matter of the wedding gift, possibly the most important gift there is to buy.  So what could possibly befit such a gent and his beautiful bride?  1)   urlLink A Merkin  . A gift from the heart, and one that can be shared with loved ones and friends. Personally, at the wedding reception I look forward to hearing the words " Nat, Give us a twirl "as she tries it on for the first time!!  2)   urlLink A Wax Jacket  . You know you want one Robert, even if its just so you can show it to Nat on your wedding night! Only true Wax jacket connoisseurs know its actually supposed to be worn around your nob! 3)   urlLink Du pain  . Mon je soif je voudrais un Orangina Robert et I want some pain. 4)  A Sad Bastards Accessory Kit . Complete with tank tops, candy cigarettes, a barrel of Stella Artois and Dave King peering at you spewing in his toilet! 5)   urlLink A Bucket  . You never know when you'll need one to pop your head in, just think of the embarrassment if you forget to put it on before you pass out and spew on the floor!  Decisions, decisions!  Well, no doubt I shall be posting here more as the big day approaches and my pants begin to feel the strain of my nerves!  The  Stag Party  is provisionally booked in for  July 17th , Mr Wickins will be in for a treat! Ha ha!

      Stumbled upon the  urlLink Whatsbetter  website and it makes compulsive viewing, you are given  two  choices which you have to decide the best!  The results are compiled against each other to decide which is the best thing ever!  The current  top ten  is:  1) Sex! 2) A sense of humour 3) Love 4) The best thing you can imagine 5) Free money 6) Unlimited wealth 7) Charlie Brown Christmas 8) Romance 9) Natalie Portman 10) Built-in slide  Although I'm encouraged to see  urlLink Calvin & Hobbes  lurking at Number 14, and  urlLink Monty Python & The Holy Grail  creeping in at Number 17!  After only a few goes I was faced with such tricky choices as:   Iraq needs porn  or  A Kazoo   Doctor Strange  or  Model Railways   World Peace  or  Covetousness   Heidi Fleiss  or  Peter Gabriel   Cadbury's Creme Eggs  or  Action Figures   With such hard decisions to be made in today's society, I'm beginning to wonder if I should just remain a student!

      An innocent day out at Dan and Raynor's House! One thing always leads to another!    urlLink    The FA Cup celebrations began with some glorious weather, a fridge (and freezer) full of beer, and a fine spread put on by Miss Raynor!   urlLink    The gorgeous weather inspired a manly collaboration of DIY and cricket.   urlLink    Dave enjoyed Andy's frantic wrist action between his legs!   urlLink    Success! As fine a set of stumps as any in International Cricket!   urlLink    Like a proud dad-to-be Dave admired the finely crafted set of stumps, fashioned from Raynor's skirting board!   The initial 'stump testing' was complete. Now for some heavy duty action down at the park! We should have known it was going to end in tears!   urlLink    Armed with a kit bag full of beer (no space for the cricket stuff!) we set off for pastures green, the stumps deserved a proper cricketing baptism!   urlLink    Spotted by the locals, and fearing they may mistakenly think we were perving on their tennis playing daughters, Andy performed his  He-Man  routine.... " He has the POWER !"   urlLink    Disaster strikes! With the field set up, and everyone in position, Dan came to the crease and let rip! Perfectly poised with the bat handle in his fingers, the bat flew majestically 50feet into the sky.   The game was over .

      ...making Weetabix cookies. Cooking home-made meatballs. Drinking Miss Raynors alcoholic concoctions. Indulging in cricket-bat burning. Feeding a panoply of farmyard animals. Riding on a tractor. Getting sun-burned. Initiating a Rolf Harris Tribute band. Under-performing in the National IQ test. Handcrafting a new cricket bat. Excelling in the First Annual Sudbrooke ball game championship!  All of which resulted in the lack of posts over the weekend. But rest assured that as dawn breaks tomorrow I shall be updating you all on the crazy goings-on that occurred, including photos courtesy of Miss Raynor!  Apologies also to Miss Kendrick, I shall endeavour to get your link posted tomorrow too!

      At the behest of his highness Prince Buxton of Notts, I bring news of the work of genius that is DJ Danger Mouse's   Grey Album  . Bar the awful 99 Problems, which does absolutely nothing to enhance the track, the album is absolutely sublime.  Mixing  Jay Z 's vocals with musical tit-bits from the  Beatles  White Album, the overall effect is stunning and is testament to the hours of sampling that Danger Mouse carried out on the beatles masterpiece. Working for weeks to sample every little drum riff and musical sequence that would complement Jay Z's final body of work.  The New Yorker published an interesting piece in February,  urlLink The Mouse That Remixed , which highlights the work Danger Mouse did as well as the subsequent interest that came his way. None of which, unfortunately, looks likely to get the album the full release it undoubtedly deserves.  Let common sense prevail everyone, and give this guy the break he deserves. An album, written for the personal enjoyment of himself and a few friends, identified by everyone who hears it as a masterpiece. Produced with no intent for personal gain, this album needs to be heard and in a perfect world would be.  Alas, to the dismay of the Prince, it seems destined to remain hidden.

Opposite me was a little stone gnome who began singing to me but without making any noise, we ended up having a silent sing off with each of us getting more and more exuberant in our facial movements. After a while I noticed a female director staring at us laughing profusely, at which point the gnome's little stone hat slid off his head.&nbsp; urlLink    Then I woke up.

I found the documentary very interesting, in particular the way it gave an interesting twist on the  nature/nurture  debate, as well as to how certain aspects of American society can moralise killing when it suits their own means.  Looking at Nick's  urlLink website  made me realise how little I actually knew about his work, other than the highly publicised  urlLink Aileen Wuornos ,  urlLink Kurt & Courtney , and the  urlLink Biggie & Tupac  documentarys.

I've done my time in Poundland, the Shell Garage, the Onion Factory, Mastercare warehouses, building sites, Greenwoods Menswear et al.  No this time its to be a proper job, no more dossing around each day.   Playing snooker when I have 3000 words due in yesterday .  Never again .  Laying in, watching 6 hours of daytime TV pap when there are umpteen other essential jobs awaiting .  Ha Ha, a thing of the past I tell you .  So here goes, my valiant attempt to actually get a proper job and live an honourable existance. Updated each day in the faint hope that it may, somehow, aid in my eternal struggle against life as we know it.  What would Fred Elliot say... " I tell thee Ashley, I tell thee "

       urlLink     Me and Ang watched  urlLink this wonderful film  on DVD at the weekend.  Set in and around a Glasgow second-hand bookshop and the nearby hospital, the story revolves around a chronically suicidal Wilbur and his older brother Harbour.   urlLink      Having heard nothing about the film prior to watching it I absolutely loved it. The humour is sometimes necessarily slight, sometimes blatant but always completely bizarre! And it all works so well.    urlLink     The mix of comedy and sadness, at first, seem rather at odds. As is trying to maintain some sympathy for the characters when the love-triangle develops. But then you realise that this is intentional, provoking plenty of thoughtful moments and building to the whole atmosphere of the film.  Definitely one film going in my DVD collection!

      Via [ urlLink BBC News ]  The BBC news website featured a story on Monday about the new ultrasound technology being used to discover more about the life of the foetus in the womb.  There are some incredible images being produced. This is at 22 weeks gestation, showing the baby's sensory skills developing to allow it to scratch, rub and pat his cheek and nose!   urlLink     The foetus has been shown to exhibit some behaviour identical to what it will do after birth. In this picture the foetus, when upright on a flat surface, tries to move forward.   urlLink     After birth, babies take up to 4-6 weeks before they smile. However, in the womb they can smile although the reasons for this are not yet known. Personally, I'm not sure I'd call this a smile, a 'gurn' maybe!   urlLink     And never mind finding comfort in sucking your thumb.  This baby has found himself a nice juicy big toe!

      Have had an evening listening to  urlLink Elliott Smith , the greatest singer-songwriter that ever graced this planet. Not sure why I've never written about him before but suddenly felt the need to tonight. Probably because I was trying to work out the piano part to  urlLink 'Son Of Sam'  from his 'Figure 8' album. The last album before he died. Or was he murdered?  The man was a genius. There is no other way of describing him. Tortured. Depressed. Lonely. But the greatest song writer ever.  This picture is a snippet from the cover of his  Figure 8  album.  urlLink     A truly wonderful album. A demonstration of how truly great one singer could be, playing all his own instruments and doing his own thing.   urlLink     Really still can't believe he is dead. A legacy of beautiful songs, some sad, some just stupidly brilliant, keep him alive.  A beautiful man. Elliott Smith.

I was expecting to hear whether I was through on Friday 18th June by letter and so put it to the back of my mind. Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon the phone rings, expecting it to be my mum or my brother I answered with a lazy sunday " Yo ", only to hear the voice of the Lincolnshire Probation Service co-ordinator telling me I was through! Glad they weren't testing my telephone skills!!  Next interview is  Tuesday 13th July ! Got a presentation to plan for that in the meantime, so updates as and when required!!

      Via [ urlLink Sore Eyes ]  The website  urlLink retroCRUSH  has come up with the coolest idea ever. Polling readers on their favourite guitar, drum, or piano solo, best obscure lyric and so on.  And so they devised the  urlLink Top 50 Coolest Song Parts ! Complete with small MP3 files to hear the song parts in question!!!  Not sure if I agree with all the choices but there are some blinders on there,  urlLink Prince's guitar riff  from " Let's Go Crazy " is wicked and  urlLink The Who's opening synthesiser riff  from " Baba O'Riley " has always been one of my favourites!  I do think the lyrical gem from " Tribute " by Tenacious D should have got higher than #41, facing the demon threat with such aplomb.  Demon : "Be you Angels?"  Tenacious D : "Nay, we are but men,  ROCK !"  The problem with polling a Top 50 list like this is that it always misses out some of your own favourites. I'd have loved to have seen the whiney synthesiser riff from Tina & Ike Turner's  'Nutbush City Limits' !!  A quality title and a great tune!!

Jonathon was orphaned in March after his parents were caught peddling crack cocaine across the Colombian/Arctic border. Their public beheading left little Jonathon feeling withdrawn and confused, and it took me a few weeks to get him talking again.  But now Jonathon is like a new penguin, and is due to feature in the new James Bond film as the Bond girl  Frosty McCrotch . A comedy tour is scheduled around Christmas with support from  'Pingu and the Pinguettes' !  I'm thinking of getting myself a duck too!   Pop over to  urlLink bunnyherolabs  and adopt yourself a wee animal!

      ...when you're having fun!  No entries for the past week what with looking after the missus and darting round the country in the  urlLink Batmobile !!  Angie came down with a nasty case of tropical frostbite, otherwise known medically as  urlLink tonsilitis . Cue much mopping of her fevered brow!  Managed to get quite a few pictures taken in and around Ipswich of which I'll be posting a few as and when I get time.  Also, after a request from Mr Cawte -  Ireland's 2nd most greatly received import  (after Miss Herring), I shall be posting a tribute to the wonderful game of  Stairball . Possibly one of the greatest games ever invented.

      [via  urlLink Ben Hammersley ]  " urlLink WordCount™  is an interactive presentation of the 86,800 most frequently used English words"   urlLink     This is brilliant! A very clever Flash application!  In its own words it-  'presents the 86,800 most frequently used English words, ranked in order of commonality. Each word is scaled to reflect its frequency relative to the words that precede and follow it, giving a visual barometer of relevance. The larger the word, the more we use it. The smaller the word, the more uncommon it is.'   A few of my favourites-   plinth  #23108  mellifluous  #62851  panoply  #42958  misanthropic  #77633  laburnum  #45345

      ...announce 2  urlLink David Devant & His Spirit Wife  gigs that I can actually get to!   urlLink     And to make it even better, they're on consecutive days!!!   DD&HSW  are my favourite band, but while I've been at Uni for the last 6 years I've not been able to see them. So the gigs at York and Hull (October 7th/8th) can't come soon enough!  I urge you wholeheartedly to check them out, they are absolutely amazing!

       urlLink     In a similar vein to the  urlLink Exploding Dog  website, the  urlLink Devoted Bee  website is a great site with some weird and wonderful pictures.  Home to the egg-straordinary  urlLink Eggpants!  And also the brilliant  urlLink Hamilton and Reggie Metal!   urlLink     The picture here is too small to read properly but if you use the link there are loads. Some of the older strips in the  urlLink archive  are pure genius!   urlLink Plant Care  and  urlLink Chicken Storm  are my favourites.

       urlLink     This  urlLink website  is wonderful! Regular readers send Sam random titles such as  urlLink 'and he did that'  or  urlLink 'I am out of ideas'  and produces weird and wonderful picture creations!  There are 1000's to look at so its definitely an archive to look at in installments!

      Last Saturday we had the big Stag Day for  Squire Wickins !  And a fantastic time was had by all! &nbsp; Photo's are being processed as we speak and will be posted as soon as we get them. The day was action-packed and was probably one of the best day/nights out we've ever had! &nbsp; I'll put more details up when I have the pictures, as I'm sure it will all make more sense then! &nbsp; Just got to wait for the big day now ( August 7th ) and get my best man speech done!

      I have had my final interview for  Probation Officer  yesterday! Really not sure how it went, the interviews were the hardest things I've ever done, and I came out of them feeling like I'd done a marathon!  I should hear, either way, by the end of next week! Fingers crossed because I think I'm going to need all the luck I can get!

      Would you believe it, after all that waiting around I missed the flower opening!   urlLink     After going to bed late Tuesday night I wasn't able to get on the net until this morning and it turns out that, during yesterday, the bloody thing closed back up again!! So I never got to see the thing fully in bloom! Gutted!! Serves me right I suppose!

      The beast is blooming!  urlLink     It's going slow but I'm sure it's not going to be long. I dread to think what the smell must be like inside that room!  I'm going to try and get regular screengrabs from the webcam in order to try and build up a timelapse profile.

      Looks as though today will be the day!!   urlLink     The plant looks as though it is beginning to give in to gravity! The large 'spathe' at the top is beginning to loosen its grip around the main section of the plant and the sheer size of the flower means it should begin to bloom soon!!  I can't believe I'm just sat here watching the plant!

      Continuing from my post about  titan arum  a few days ago, the mighty flower was due to bloom around June 30th. It has, however, continued to grow about an inch a day and shows no sign of stopping! The botanists at the  University of Connecticut  fear that instead of flowering the thing may just explode!!  The Uni guys have been keeping a  urlLink daily progress chart  to show its growth pictorially and in charts.  To give you some idea of how big this thing is getting here are some sequential photos from the last  month !!  June 8th -  16.5 inches tall . A mere baby in comparison to how big it's going to get!  urlLink     June 14th -  25.75 inches  tall  urlLink     June 17th -  33 inches  tall. Getting big so they employed a gimp to guard it!  urlLink     June 22nd -  45.75 inches  tall. For public safety they've now replaced the gimp with this dude!  urlLink     June 25th -  51.25 inches  tall. Now this chump gets in on the action! I swear that's Germany's ex manager Rudi Voller!!  urlLink     June 30th -  56 inches  tall. At this point it was thought that the plant was going to flower.  urlLink     However, as of 9.30pm GMT today, the thing is still holding out!!  urlLink     Keeping an eye on the  urlLink webcam  so I can hopefully get a screengrab just as it opens! Sad I know!  All pictures courtesy of The University of Connecticut.

      ...by any other name would smell as sweet.  The famous  titan arum  is about to flower! Otherwise known as the  corpse flower  it releases the stench of rotting flesh so as to attract the flies it needs to pollinate it.   urlLink     The  urlLink University of Connecticut  has been cultivating one for the last TEN years! And its about to open. And it's all live on the net!  Take a look at the  urlLink webcam !  The flowering only lasts for a few days so catch it now!! Luckily it isn't  Smellyvision  as the plant has a smell akinned to old socks, rotten vegetables and dead fish!!  And if the whole thing isn't cool enough, the plant is warm-blooded so that it can heat up and better spread its putrid aroma!!

      Just heard my first taste of  urlLink Velvet Revolver  on TOTP tonight and i can say i am suitably impressed.   urlLink     Home to the talents of Guns 'N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum, plus Stone Temple Pilots troubled singer Scott Weiland plus Dave Kushner of Wasted Youth, I have to admit the sound wasn't quite what I was expecting.  The sound was somewhat similar to that of  Screaming Trees  which can only be a good thing.  Briefly checking out the website there is a lot to be catching up on, and with the debut album,  Contraband , selling more first week copies in the US than any other rock album it seems the hype may actually be believeable.  Am now looking forward to wading through the music and video files available at the home site!

      I defy anyone to work out what the hell  urlLink this website  is all about!?!?!  An example quote -   'Stephen laughs and drinks all night with every karaoke singer because one agreeable orange organizes a fruit. The wasp who plans an escape from aardvark makes love to that Dalmatian goes deep sea fishing with the monkey. The goose finds lice on a unicorn and the bastard groundhog writes a love letter to a martini. This heron steals pencils from Stephanie'   Excuse me. What?
