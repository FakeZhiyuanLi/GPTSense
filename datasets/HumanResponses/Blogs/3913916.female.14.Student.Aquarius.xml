      Isko. Kat. Mic-mac. Steph. Vicky. Lari. Lianne. Klarisse.  It's really nice to get along with someone; to spend time with someone not that close with you; and with someone you can be bestfriends with. I love to have a time with my not-too-close-friends and get to know them better.  I just hope that I may be able to bond with my other classmates because its been 3 yrs since I've entered Honor Sec but until now, I don't know them that well.  ** Ang saya ng araw ko!! Ang saya talaga sa house ni Klar. Nag-reminisce kami nila Steph, Vicky, Lari, Lianne at Klar. Ang saya saya. Nakita pa namin nila Klar, Vicky at Lari si Sir Romero nung may buhok pa sya. Pinakita namin, using webcam, kanila Pielle. Pati kanila Sophie. Tapos pati pic ni Soj nung Sr Prep. Ang asteeg talaga!! Sa totoo lang, hindi kami natapos sa mga proj.**

      Go to:  urlLink Googlism    and search for you name...  I'm sure you'll laugh at the results   Example: "karen is open and willing to listen to criticism" "karen is an “active villager” at the eev"  or is that AAv?  "karen is a friend who is there for you always" "karen is a kind person" "karen is the woman of my dreams"  yuck! sinong karen kaya yan?

       As jam said, "kung may aalis sa buhay mo, dun mo lang malalaman kung gano mo pala siya mahal"    Grabe pala kapag may aalis sa buhay mo. Kahit ilang buwan palang nagkakasama, talagang naramdaman mo yung  importance  nung taong yun sa buhay mo. Hindi mo akalain na  one day  bigla syang aalis sa buhay mo. Hindi mo napapansin yung mga ginagawa nya, sinasacrifice nya para lang sayo.  You take advantage of the kindness this person showed you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hindi mo naipapakita yung  thankfulness  sa mga ginawa nya  for you.   Sana isipin din natin na kahit sa tingin ng iba, na nakakainis ang taong yun,  he still touched our lives and we thank him for this.  Its so hard to think that someone moving away and leaving us because of some conflicts or issues we have.    Sana talaga magbago ang isip ni sir guinto...

       "I miss you when there's no reason, how much more if there was. I miss you more when you reply, how much more if you don't. I miss you after I see you, how much more if I see you never. I miss you now how much more later..."   Katrina Santos. Rachel Casis. JM Ochangco. Rosemae Rubio. Patrick Deyto. Leonette Gonzaga. Jessica Carlos. Rina Villar. Larson Smit. Joseph Castro. and everybody else! I miss them all. Some were really my closest friends, even best friends, some were just friends. All the moments we had, all our laughter we shared together, the getting-to-know-you days, and every memory. I miss them all; I miss that all. I want to talk to them again; befriend them again; bond with them; and laugh and talk to them. If I could just turn back time, I'll really do something about this - like always talk to them, just by saying HI is enough. All I want is to bring back all the memories we had. Sigh. Even those people I still get to talk to, I still miss them coz before we had that bonding, but now, our friendship isn't that stronger. People like... Pielle Pacifico. Judd Antonio. Norman Riego. Yvana Carangan. Michael Kalalo. etc. etc. So now, I've made a promise to myself that I will keep all the friends I have now and still make new ones.

       after a finished book, comes another start, another book...    i'm almost finished with the book,  the notebook,  so i decided to make this kind of entry...     &nbsp;  End. End. End.  Everybody, and everything, comes to an end.  When our lives end, someday, we'll live again in another form.   We don't know when our lives might end. What we know is that it ends.  So we better make the best of our everyday lives. We don't know when we'll be taken away from our bodies.   Do all the good things you can do while you're still alive - in short  magpaka- holy  kayo .  If you've done something bad, start a new life.  Read another book .

       "High expectations are the key to everything. ~ Sam Walton   (from  urlLink Daily Celebrations )   Is that so? If high expectations are the "key to everything" well why does our school expect more from our section? Shouldn't they expect more from the other sections too?   It is hard to be in the  Honor Section  even though its fun. The teachers expect you to be good at this, at that, at almost everything! It's hard to live up to what they expect you to do. Can't they image what its like to live up for someone else's expectations. It's really hard to understand these people. Why can't they be fair enough? We're just human beings like the other people in other sections.    wala na ko ibang maisip na topic eh...

       "...Thank you, for teaching me how to love for showing me what is... and now I know, there is nothing that I could ask for more, thanks to you..."      "...Farewell to you my friend, we'll see each other again. Don't cry coz its not the end of everything...I may be miles away, but here in your heart I'll stay, with you, my friend..."    Some people come and go. Some leave then someone else takes there place in your life. Some leave without anyone noticing.  Of course, special people in our lives won't be disregarded. We would miss them, feel so lonely without them and of course, always txt/call/email them most of the time.  Hindi natin maiiwasan yung pag-alis ng mga espesyal na tao sa buhay natin. Mahirap mapigilan ang pag-alis ng isang tao.  But in every loss there's always a replacement. And someday, somehow, this lost person would be found again.  The "replacement" of the special person may not be as special as the lost one. But at least we have someone NEW to share our lives with.  It may hurt to lose a friend/a loved one. But it takes time for us to heal that "hurt" we feel inside.  They may keep in touch with us so far but time after time they would stop communicating with us.  Someday this lost person would just pop out of nowhere and say 'Hi' and whatsoever. Then we might not know this person that well. We might not also know [by face]&nbsp;who they are the next time we see them.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  ** I made this entry for the day because 1 of our classmate last year -  jeanne  cruz sent vicky an letter/card for the class. It felt sad for me coz even though we weren't that close friends there are some memories we shared together. Another reason is  Sir Romero 's moving to another department. He's been very nice to us.&nbsp;They are planning to move him to another department this school year. For a short period of time, Sir was really nice and gave interesting facts that made our discussions very fun to learn.  Bea,  also made a card for us. I know I'll really miss her even if we didn't spend time with each other.**     &nbsp;   sorry medyo magulo 'to...wala ako sa sarili ko ngayon...atsaka may ginagawa ako...   oh klar, lari, yan wala na si mickey ah! [ay sa xanga nga pala yun! hahaha]

       "He said simply,"My daddy used to tell me that the first time you fall in love, it changes your life forever, and no matter how hard you try, the feelin' never goes away. This girl you been tellin' me about was your first love. And no matter what you do, she'll stay with you forever..."    As the saying goes, "First love never dies." That's true, of course. When you fall in love the first time in your life, you'll love that person so much because its the first time you'll experience how it feels to love and be loved.  For me, I don't know if I've felt this before but it's really hard to forget that person I first liked. Until now, I still like him. I really can't forget him.  yuck! what the heck am i saying?  Anyways, this guy isn't cute  parang ako lang nacu-cutan sa kanya  he's so funny  that's what everyone likes about him i think  but he's annoying  some people just don't like that attitude of his  he's smart  of course!  i really don't want to describe him coz other people might know who he is.  dont want him to know it  Getting back, the memories of the first love just doesn't want to die unless there's a closure between the two people involved.    wala na ko ma-say, wala naman kasi akong experience eh...share nalang kayo....

       "He is happiest, be he king or peasant, who finds peace in his home."- Johann von Goethe    I've experienced living with the urban people. It wasn't really that bad. It was really fun. The people there were nice, friendly and outgoing. Some of them just seem scary. But almost all of them were really, really  maasikaso.  I really loved my foster family coz they were really nice and easy to get along with. I also met a new friend. Her name is Jonalyn. She's a little girl. And she's really, really cute!! She even kissed me on the cheek when she was about to go.  Aww how sweet!  I'll really gonna miss her!!!

       i die without seeing the sun rise on my own country. you who are to see the dawn, welcome it, and do not forget those who fell during the night  (- Jose Rizal , from his book " Noli Me Tangere ")   Isn't that a nice quotation from Jose Rizal. We should at least love the country where we were born. Jose Rizal died without seeing our country rise up from all the fight the war or whatsoever before. But we saw it. We should at least try to keep the peace and unity we have now. Love our country. Take care of that peace. And do all these for the sake of those who fought for the peace we have now.

        "I am nothing special; of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."   (from the book,  The Notebook  by  Nicholas Sparks )   Everyone is a simple person; not known to everyone. Unless we do something great that everyone will remember and cherish. I may be a common person today, but tomorrow  in the near future  I may become someone known to man. People close to me may someday forget me. But one day, I know they'll remember me. Heroes, rich people, Presidents, Officials, etc. etc. - they are the people known in the world. They did/do things that are unforgettable and unimaginable. They are  SPECIAL . I hope, I too, would be special even just for the people around me.  We have a lot of works we can do that can simply make us popular. Even by doing the simplest things in this world, we will be well-known. If not well-known to the people, maybe by GOD we could be.

       'Tis better to have  loved  and lost than never to have  loved &nbsp;at all. -Samuel Butler   Well, I haven't experienced it yet but I could compare it with the feeling I had before.&nbsp; It is true but it hurts. You know what I mean. sigh. Love. love. love.    Sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light. - Albert Schweitzer   Yeah its true. I really wanna thank my friends who've been there for me throughout. I lvoe them so much and I'll treasure them forever!    The hardest things in life is which bridge to cross and which to burn. -David Russel   I know that and I've experienced it. I've  burned the wrong bridge  and  crossed the other one . Now I regret all those  wrong bridge  that I've  crossed  and ignored the deserving ones.    That's all for now...

      Isn't it hard  for someone like me &nbsp;to say  I Love You  to your parents? If I'd really have a chance, I'd do it. But somethings really pulling me away.&nbsp; That's why I'm also with that  pulling away  now, from my family. Our communication with each other is not open. We don't talk about things like school, or personal ones. I'm the one who's really moving away from them. I don't know why. I really can't explain it. I really don't like to go home everytime after school. I wanna stay with my friends and talk with them.&nbsp; It's easy to talk to them coz they know so many info about me. Is it bad that I do it? When I'm at home, I'm really not close with my brother. I ignore him most of the time. I move away and ignore him. My other brother, I don't ignore. He's close to me compared to my other brother. Sometimes I don't like him coz he always tells me to do this do that.... But it's OK. My dad, I don't like his jokes and name calling. That's why I hate it when he calls my friends some other name. My mom, she's ok. She's always there for me.  all of them are   If you ask me, friends or family, I pick  FRIENDS.  I'm really closer to them. They're like family to me already. That's why in our Reco, I really cried because I know I've done so many bad thigngs to my family.

Someone so sweet,    I really want to meet    Someone who's very funny,    In times of sorrow makes me happy,    Someone so musical,    Very vocal, and lyrical.    Someone who'll make me fell loved,    Now and forever, make me beloved.    Hpe to find that "someone"    To be called "my one"    Someone I always knew,    That someone must be YOU!

       "mabait, tahimik but when you get-to-know her/ pag naging close ka sa kanya maingay pala, helps you, namimigay ng food...etc." That's what some people think of me. I didn't see that I was like that. It wasn't just my quietness/shyness that they see in me. There are also some traits that they can know about me. It made me have a little more confidence in myself. I really wanna know what they think of me more. It makes me feel alot better; alot happier.&nbsp; I really don't know what to say about them coz they aren't really close friends with me. But at least I told some traits I know they have.   &nbsp;

      I don't know why but I've got this feeling that my friends and I have this some kind of wall between us. Not because of someone/something. I don't know. It's like were beginning to break. Not totally but just some parts of us begins to break in little pieces. I know that something might have changed in them but why like this? Is our friendship being tested by a big wall between us; a long road we need to cross before we see each other; or maybe a 2 different worlds we are in? I may be just insecure or something or maybe just got used being with her all the time/ most of it. But I just feel that she's flowing away/tearing apart or just moving away from me.&nbsp;What could this be? Is it just me or is it our bond is breaking?

       Before, I really don't appreciate what my parents have been doing for me. Now, because of someone's blog, I began to realize all the pain, the sufferings, the stress they've been doing just for me to be healthy, to study at a great school and for me to grow good and all.&nbsp; I really don't know how to show my parents and brothers how they really mean to me; how I appreciate each and everything they do for me; all the love they show me; and EVERYTHING! I didn't see it before. I always took it for granted. But for some people who doesn't have their parents with them, they would be really greatful for those kind of suffering their parents would do just for them. I don't know how to say "I Love You" to my parents because its really awkward for me to tell them these 3 words.&nbsp;

      Changes. All what happens in ones life. Change occurs everyday, everytime, everywhere. People, places, features...almost everything! I, for one, had changed in the past years. I realized I've changed since the day I first entered DLSZ. It came to me that now I've grown up. I became taller, became "smarter," became DIFFERENT! My personality, for example, is really different from before. Outgoing, friendly, boyish. That was ME before. Now, I'm shy, kinda friendly, kinda girly girl. Look what change can do to a person. "Become a student of change. It is the only thing that will remain constant." Anthony J. D'Angelo.  That's really true. But we should at least think before we act. Think of the consequences that may happen if you'll change something. It may be bad or may be good. But as for me, I really didn't see that I was changing. It didn't notice that I was changing. It just came to me that I was not the same as before.  Everytime a flower blooms and then withers away, a new flower blooms and then again, withers. Everytime a flower grows it changes just like me. But, this change doesn't stop there. It continues growing until it blooms. For me, I'm still a closed bud waiting to bloom and then wither in the end. But this kind of life is useless without the sun, water and soil i grow in. These things are someone important to me. Meaning, my loved one. I can't just wither and die without being loved.

      regret.regret.regret.all the wrong decisions ive made makes me regret the past! i hate it! why does this all to have to happen? now, my life's really change because of all the decisions ive made before.  when the sun first shined upon you, i saw your reflection. i saw how you were smiling before me. i saw the passion you had. i saw all the love you had inside. i saw you. i liked you. but when i knew you had feelings for me too, my life changed. our relationship, as friends changed. i dont know how. i dont know why. but one thing i know, its all because of my feelings for you. you were nice, you were sweet, you even gave me a rose. but what did i do? ignore you?! avoid you?! shouldn't i have showed the same feelings i have for you? for a year we've been doing this. all that year weve been avoiding and ignoring each other. but that span of time, i didnt ever forgot you; you're face; you're sweetness. i know i still had feelings for you but it wasnt really good enough. now we meet again. but now youre beginning to talk to me, and i did the same. now i feel kinda ok with you not like before that i feel very awkward when your around. it wasnt the same. before we were close. we shared our laughs, our happiness, our sad times with the class, our FOOD! everything! we did this with the class. but now, well we do things with the class but not like before that we were really close and we talk most of the time. i really miss those times. i just hope that you'll read this and miss the times we were together as friends, close friends. wi miss the times we had. the games we played, the jokes we laugh at, the problems we shared that includes assignments and test, all the memories we shared are unpriceable. now ive kinda accepted that past is past. i cant change it anymore. ill just make my future very memorable. as before was just a memory that will stay in my heart all my life.

       August 10, 2004 Tuesday    So Incomplete...     Even though it seems I have everything I don't wanna be a lonely fool All of the women All the expensive cars All of the money don't amount to you I can make believe I have everything But I can't pretend that I don't see That without you girl my life is incomplete   It seems so incomplete without something that lasted for sometime already - like a plant without the soil, a body without the soul, internet without websites, a story without words and words without letters, etc. Doesn't it feel so incomplete without that special someone for you to love? Don't you feel somethings missing in your life?  **someone to love here means "the one," every girl's prince charming, the beauty in every beast or the girl of a guy's dreams...**  It may seem that our hearts miss something - a little piece of our hearts we're looking for in a haystack. We may not be looking for that piece at the moment, but one day, someone will hand it over to you and guess who that is? - The real "missing piece" in your heart.   August 11, 2004    Memories   It's been a while. 14 years had passed and now, my life's beginning to become very difficult. The world's change! Everything changed! As I look back, I see myself being someone I didn't think I was. It struck me to think I was like this, I was like that. But now, reality check! I've changed!  I may not be able to change the past, but I can reminisce and think about all the memories I've shared with other people; the laughter and joy; the people I've spent time with that made me become the person I am now; and all the things that changed me.  It's nice to look back at the past. I often wish to go back in that past. I loved my past. But now, I've just got to let it go, one way or another. I can't live my life with the past! As people say, "Past is Past!" But still, some other people say,"It takes time" So let's just wait and see!   August 13, 2004    All By Myself    "All by myself... Don't wanna be... All by myself!! Anymore!!..."   This day, I really felt the all alone - even though my friends and classmates are around me. I felt the emptiness inside of me. I felt how a  LONER  feels. Even towards my friends, I felt out of place. It may be my fault, too, because I don't come with them and all that. Now it just me and a "new" closer friend.   It's Been A Long Time  It's really been a while since I last went online. I missed all the chatting and surfing!! Sigh. But now, I'm back!!!   Rejection from a Friend  Here I go again, feeling lonely. Plus, REJECTED! It's like being rejected and ignored by the people close to you! Doesn't that feel *ouch!* People ignoring me... Talking to me when they have no one else to talk to... things like that! Sigh. Its just so heartbreaking!! :(

       Peer Pressure  Never felt pressured by my friends. Never wanted to be IN. If I want to be friends with them, I just wait for them to say HI and it starts there. With a simple HI begins a friendship.  But sometimes, it really doesn't...  Anyways, it doesn't matter if I don't become EVERYONE's friend. As long as I've got my friends, that's fine with me.   This blog.  Do you mind if I ask you a favor? Please give me topics I could put on my blog. I can't think of any topic anymore...   About my day...   It SUCKS!  My glasses got lost!! And this is the 2nd time that I lost my glasses. I'm dead meat when I tell this to my mom.  The truth is, I'm not going to tell her, not YET. I'll be saving some money then when I reach P1000, I'll tell my mom. I just hope I'll be able to be patient until I save enough money.  It's really going to be a heck of a week or so without my glasses...

      "Pieces Of Me" On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care  When I'm angry, you listen Make me happy it's a mission And you won't stop til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face...I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...  (from  urlLink A-Z Lyrics )   The Ashlee Simpson Show  I just realize now, that Jessica Simpson has a younger sister who is, Ashlee Simpson. She is also starred in "7th Heaven." She's the girlfriend of Simon there. I liked one of her song  and the lyrics is up there.  The tune was really nice.   just wanted to share...

       wala akong magawa...      A BOOK To Remember  I just finished reading "A Walk To Remember" and Jam was right - it was really a nice book  and inspiring too!   Now I'm thinking of what book I should read next.   A Long Rest For ME  Today, I really slept for hours. I woke up at 9:45am then after lunch at about 2:30, I slept again. I was really tired and exhausted from all the work last week  and also this week  so I got the chance to rest for a very long time. It was such a nice day for me!! But I think this day wasn't enough for my rest...   Ella Enchanted  Lianne let me borrow her "Ella Enchanted" DVD. It was really a nice movie. I LOOOVEEEE it!!  Hope it happens to me... But not the "obedience" gift thing... I don't want to be SOOO obedient that I'll do everything someone says. I'll look stupid!  Anyways, the story was really funny, romantic and very MUSICAL!! I loved the songs there. Especially the part where Ella was in Giantville(?) and she was asked to sing. That song was really CUTE!!   Klarisse's Birthday  I'm so excited already!!  As if I'm klar...  But because, there's a possibility my crush would be there...  I just hope he does go...

       Happiness after all the tears:   Kaninang AP time, di ko akalain na nakakamiss pala ang pagtawa during AP time because of Sir Guinto's jokes. Kanina ko lang napansin ang happiness ng mga tao sa mukha nila. Talagang nung Monday at medyo nung Tuesday, ang lungkot ng mga tao. Tapos ngayon, makikita mo sa mga mukha nila at sa mga ngiti na abot langit ang tuwa nila, at kasama na ko dun, having Sir Guinto around.     I know it was only "God's plan" and part of life that, that happened to us. But at least we've learned a lesson not to take someone for granted.   Memories...  It's nice to bring back all the memories. Even though we had some tears or sadness in the past, its nice to remember all these and see what it has done to us now in the present.  Just like the one I said, after the tears and anger we had before, now I can see some discipline and LOTS of happiness and laughter in their faces.  Ang saya tingnan ng mga tao  after  all that  happened .      **Sorry for bringing back that topic...Ü**

       Pansinin Mo Naman Ako     Pansinin mo naman ako, Konting pagtingin ang hinihingi sa'yo. Pansinin mo naman ako, Puso ko'y litong lito, Kung pag-ibig nga'y totoo. Pansinin mo naman ako, Hirap na hirap damdaming para sa'yo. Pansinin mo naman ako, Kung pwede lang sanang itigil ko na ito. Pansinin mo naman ako, Nakatingin lagi sa tulad mo, Ikaw lagi ang hanap ng pusong ito. Pansinin mo naman ako, Iyon lang ang hinihiling ko, Pansinin mo naman ako, Pansinin mo naman ang pag-ibig na alay sa'yo...  Sigh.

       Life is full of surprises.  You'll never know that what's happening to you now will be part of it.  One day, we need to make a decision, a right one.  But when we chose the wrong decision, we will regret it for the rest of our lives!  We would want to go back in time and change that past.  But no one can do that now.
