      Today is Thursday. Today went for my second interview! Woke up at 7.30am! Yuppy! Got the job! :P SO damn happy!  Went out for lunch with JN to Serangoon Garden for duck rice.  Later met Sam to go Town to Shop! Bought a halter black blouse for $15!  We had lunch at Far East Sq to eat Hot Plate Balacan Beef Fried Rice.. Too bad!  We sat at KFC outside to smoke and talk.. While talking, one man asked us whether if we mind to share seats with them. They were both Russian Guys who are seamen. I mistaken them as staff from siemens HAHAHA ! So damn funny! We had a chat with them. And the guy sitting next me was so damn close to me while chatting with me! Sam got worried and asked us to leave first. HAHAHA . What a day!
