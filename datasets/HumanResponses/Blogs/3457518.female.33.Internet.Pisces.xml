       This particular man has been a thorn in my side since he joined the group. He started with insulting me left and right, then took the side of a man who ADMITTED openly he thought sex with kids was alright, then insulted a woman who shared a story of being raped as a child, then tore me to shreds when I tried to support her by telling my own story -- kind of a "Hey, don't do that to her, I know where she's coming from. I thought I could get him to understand the effects....HA!  He turned into a monster.   He's arrogant, pompous, and humorless.  When I responded to his last post, he came at me with personal insults that rivaled anything I had said. Kind of funny, really. I made the comment:"...wonder if his wife knows he spends so much time contemplated other women..." and he turned it into ME trying to be allies with his wife and threatening to "tell" on him. Uh.... didn't do that. Of course, he proceeded to insult me as a person....   It used to really make me mad and I would come back at him with more vigor. Now, I'm quite bored with the guy.  Still, it infuriates me that people like him exist.  He fancies himself knowledgable of everything and puts forth the persona of himself as "leader of men".  He's cruel and vicious, so just about anything else he says makes me want to PUKE.  But now, it is kind of funny. I don't take his insults all that personally anymore. I just say what I want to say.   Oh yeah, he's a MAILMAN. Nothing wrong with mailmen. It is just his crazy idea that he is "better" than other people combined with his profession that is laughable. Of course, that attitude isn't pretty in ANYBODY.   American women are wonderful. I'm sure there are many other wonderful women in the world, too, but don't insult my "people". Scum.

       I have despised this man ever since he came to the group (womanvsman). I swore a few months ago that I would not speak to him at all anymore because it had gotten WAY out of hand.   Had to respond to this one, though I didn't speak to him directly.....        From:  "Daniel Marshall"    Date:  Tue May 25, 2004  2:22 am Subject:  American Women     Now my favorite Guess Who song is going through my head...actually, this message is inspired more by a common complaint I hear from American men that have traveled overseas and/or dated women from other countries- especially from Asia and Latin America. They much prefer women from these other countries, and many vow not to date American women any more. They complain that American women have been corrupted by feminism- that they don't appreciate men, don't know how to treat a man, are bitchy and whiny, are crude and unsophisticated, and chop their hair off and gain a lot of weight when they get married. They "let themselves go" once they've gotten the man to commit. Sure, lots of these guys are losers, or they want a more traditionally feminine and submissive wife- and they learn that lots of women from poorer countries want to marry an American man who will take them away to the US. These women give them more attention than they ever got at home. I look at some of these guys, and then look at my female friends- who wouldn't touch these guys with a ten foot pole. However, although I have dated and loved many American women, and married one (and never dated women from other countries, and have limited travel experience overseas), I do understand where they're coming from. I do see a lot of the "suburban housewife" look on my mail route (short hair, clean, pressed blue jeans, tennis shoes, a nice sweatshirt or polo type shirt- not the sexiest look. But in the affluent area in which I work, they are not often fat, as they know their rich husbands would trade them in for a trophy wife in a flash if they let themselves go too much), and I realized one day that my three most favorite female customers were from Brazil, Hungary, and England (although the one from Hungary left when she found out that her live-in boyfriend was diddling her daughter). I also realized that so many women in the US are quite confused and conflicted by changing sex roles and expectations for women, which does not occur so much in pre-feminist societies. Some are, indeed, nasty bitches who hate men. I would in fact recommend to men that they NEVER marry a feminist. However, there are many fine, mature post-feminist women out there if you know where to look. However, you may detect some ambivalence on this whole topic on my part- so I would like to hear other opinions on the subject. I am especially curious about how American women are viewed by men in other countries. Fire away, boys!
