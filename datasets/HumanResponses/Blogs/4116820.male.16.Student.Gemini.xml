      Well golly. I guess it's a crime to hate ones sister. Not only was I yelled at for no damn good reason, but I'm really missing my girlfriend. Shes down in North Carolina and I'm kinda wondering how she weathered that hurricane hope shes ok. I lost the Beans vs. P war. 1000 paintballs like 3 hits. I think I'll help everyone pass there day by giving them good sites to read. www.maddox.xmission.com and chester.secretpeaks.com. Oh yeah,  MONK  may be the dumbesty show I've ever seen. Actually I feel like taking a break from being so pissed. So one show that rocks is Disneys  Filmore . Also  I Love the 70s 80s and 90s  well I think I'm going to go to bed.

      So, I got up early today (6a.m.) and my mom told me to take out the trash. I got out there and what do I see? Maggots all over tghe trash ("it stunk so it couldn't stay in the garage")after taking it out I cleaned the cans and took a long shower. What relevence this has to anything else I know not but I thought I'd write it anyways. My computers on the frizt right now so I'm stuck on this one, my dads. Right about now I'm watching "Skillet - Savior" on SteelRoots which is this sweet christian music show. I'm not usually all about that kind of thing but I do like SteelRoots. Humm what to ridicule oh yes, I remember from last night. I was watching TV (bad choice) and what was on, reruns of  FULL HOUSE  I think that says just about everything. Wow, I'm so nice I cleaned my whole house today.

      It appears I'm the antichrist, obviously anyone who hates their ex-girlfriend. Is sarcastic or heaven forbid dislike anything is the antichrist in my house. Goddam I'm in for one hell of a boring lecture on how my dads trying to establish himself as the avenger of justice. (but obviously I couldn't tell you that because its so nonchalant.) I hate this pansy lets talk out our problems bull crap. What this world needs is WWIII ethnic cleansing at its finest. Get rid of my scum bag neighbors, white trash, and any other nationality's scum (actually if you look up the "N" word in the right dictionary it says "Used as a disparaging term for a member of any socially, economically, or politically deprived group of people" So lets get rid of all our "_ _ _ _ _ _ s" (I wonder if they could pull me off this site for that.)War toughens all of our people (as long as someone you know personally is involved) This war in Iraq really just won't cut the Dijon. For all of you who decide that I'm one of those people who need to die, good, you used your brain to come up with your own thought. For all of you wondering no I didn't go to Iraq, yeah I'm sure it's a hell but hey if were still there when I'm 18 I'll be right next to your son or daughter on the front lines. In fact lets have fun for a minute Pfc.(or not) Lindy England "just for fun" huh? Bull crap. You're guilty now stop being a whiner and accept your death. None of this higher ups crap just straight to the guillotine. You know how much faster crap would go if people would just plead guilty when they are and innocent when they aren't. Public Opinion might be swayed in your favor if everyone told the truth in court. (take my advice Martha, Oj, Micheal Jackson, Kobe Bryant, R Kelly, and DMX) Do you realize the amount of "celebrities" are on trial now. Shows what scum my arents generation raised.

      Don't you just hate when people mess with you for no darn reason? Today was one of those day unfortunately my parents still haven't emancipated me so I have to live with them. I was driving today and someone stopped short so I slammed on the brakes to avoid an accident. Of course this makes me a bad driver (or at least to my mom) so now she decides not to teach me anymore well you know what, UP YOURS! Then later Were in our local Marc's grocery store and my sister is running her mouth like a gosh darn retard so I say "Close your mouth before you lose it" obviously meaning shut up or I'll cut your lips off. To which my mother replys "Do what you have to, but get your anger under control". Now don't get me wrong these wern't the only reason I blew up, but driving with my mother is hell on earth and being in the mall (one of my least favorite places) didn't help. God I just want to murder everyone who ever said "Get control of your anger" you don't know me you don't know my situation. So "judge not lest ye be". Also remember you heathens repent for the end is near.

      Wow, for the first day of this im Really feeling like telling you the masses everything you need to know. In my last atricle you saw the equation 20 seconds times x amount of commercials times 4 breaks (estimate) divided by 60 to get your total minutes you get taken out of your show so heres how it comes together with 6 commercials. 6 x 20= 120 x 4 = 480/60= 8. 8 minutes of your life you won't get back and spent absorbing corporate propaganda.

      Does anyone realize how stupid this can be if you use it as a diary, who really cares that "i've sat in the DMV for like 3 hours one time" well congratulations you're average. So I guess I'll do this one up like the rest of you.  Today I woke up at 9:36 I know this because I own a clock. I didn't go get a job. I ate subway for lunch. I cheated in poker and made $100. (okay maybe I didn't) I gave up TV today. TV has way too much advertising especially when people all ready pay upwards of $35 for basic cable. So lets do the math lets say you have 4,000,000 customers in Northern Ohio, that means you make.....$140,000,000. For 140 million can't Wide Open West pay Kotex for less advertising, it's all profit for Kotex and I don't have to watch bad commercials. Either way how much advertising does Kotex, Trojan, Pepto Bismal, and Invisaline need. Suffice to say if you walk into a store these are the corporations you automaticly see bacause they pay for eye level placement. Think about this too, you see a Kotex Commercial look at the demographics. Skip all male viewers, Menopaused Women, Prepuberty girls, and now the girls on the 4 periods a year pill. (I know about it from health research.) Now think of how small an audience you get. Now assume that these women only need your product during sex, once a month, during your stint with braces, or during your dieareha. Next time you watch TV count how many commercials you see in a 30 minute show then multiply that by 20 (seconds) the divide by 60 (seconds to find how many minutes you lose from these "fine" products) Now join me and Boycott TV for a week. Email me if you do.

      I hate girls. (except Cat and any other unnamed exceptions) Women are the worst minorty in my book. (Don't you love my stupid minority comment I know it's a lie, but hey facts never were my strong point.) I say this because once again i have to listen to bad "My guy friend who beats me, whats that look for and yes he does love me" story. All guys either know what I mean or are the beater. Don't get me wrong I have no problem listening helping and talking to girls. Although when the girl is so stupid as to say the guy who beats her loves her that my friend is when I drop you like abad habbit. More Later.

      5 months jail 5 months house arrest and 30,000 dollar fine well now then what can I say except B/S 30,000 dollars for Martha Stewart is less then a slap on the wrist, you're kidding yourself if you think she hasn't paid that much on the trial allready. By the way does any one know who the judge was? Lance Ito perhaps, I mean if he lets "The Juice" off with murder i'll bet he'd let good ole Martha off with a little Insider Info. I wonder what the possibility is that she'll decorate her cot, cell bars (in a "festive" candy cane color) and have some loser bring his pets in. So, who gets to take care of her 20 cats while shes in the pokey, and another question if you're under house arrest and you name is Martha Stewart do you go to your summer home or weekend getaway if it's waterfront is the water offlimits? So many questions so little time.

      Well, Well. It seems I have a new home for all my ideas, rants, and overall whining. I know this is a blog, but I think it'll suit me much better then AOL. Next few posts will be what was on my AOL homepage, what a joke AOL is and anyone who reads this join me and don't watch TV for the rest of the week, commercials suck.

      Mat Damon is so lucky I have a girl friend. I saw the  Bourne Supremacy . I got in trouble with Cat when I laughed at the people who died/committed suicide. Then my girlfriends sister was covering my eyes during the club scene needless to say I couldn't tell you if it was nude. Then threre's some fake secret agents then this guy shoots Bourne. Then there's a chase. In the end, he admits to some chick that he killed her parents. In the last scene he learns his real name which ironically I too forget, willingly though. The first thought in my head when thinking about a Mat Damon movie was shitty love story, and I was right. Here's the good news, his girlfriend dies. In the very beginning too. She gets shot in the head by this assassin. He's supposed to kill Bourne. This is because he sets Bourne up, the reason? To steal $20,000,000. That's shit. If you're going to steal money you take more then 20 mil. How much did Enron have embezzled? Well this guy is such a good shot he hits Bournes girlfriend and doesn't make sure it's Bourne. Come on what a shitty job. More tomarrow.

      Well, before a few days ago nothing was really blow my mind away crappy or it was so crappy I chose to forget, but then I made the mistake of watching TV. 2 words, "Open Water". Yes, thats right another shitty shark movie. More money wasted so people can have their false fears about sharks exploited. Sharks almost never attack humans, and even then it's because you smell like blood or look like a seal, and hey if you look like a seal we don't mind because you're ugly. On another note John Kerry, sissy Democrat (What would possess someone to be a democrat?)still sucks. Vote independent or write yourself in for president.

Today my sister was ironing and got burned she yells the iron burned me. To which I replied No, the heat burned you. Ain't it the truth.

      I filled out applications yesterday at Subway, JcPenny, and a car wash. Today I was hanging out with Big Rick and started to cut my hair. I had messed up bad and started to shave it all when the phone rings. Well now, I wasn't expecting a call at all, but got one. My sister handed me the phone and I said "Hey, I'm shaving my head.". They reply I got was "Hi, this is Donna from JcPenny.". Argh! The one place I'd like to work I gave a really shitty first impression. Well wish me luck on my interview.

      To end this summer I've decided to just recap the summer in politics, music, movies, and overall random news. In the category of politics John Kerry won the Democratic nomination. President Bush made a bigger fool of himself by saying "Terrorists keep finding ways to harm and scare our people, and so do we." I swear to God that is an exact quote from Bush. If you watch Jay Leno you've all ready seen this. In the genre of music MTV continued to retard our youth by playing shitty rap music videos by artist like Kevin Lyttle and Akon. On a much better note rap artist Kanye West not only released a respectable song, but one about God entitled  Jesus Walks  finally the youth of America has found a mainstream artist with more morals then a wildebeest. Under the title of movies people still didn't figure out how bad they're being shafted by theaters by being over charged by Coke-a-Cola advertisements and over priced pop corn. A steady flow of shitty movies came out this summer as usual, and lets not forget about the yearly Will Smith saves the world in another shitty sci-fi movie. (See  Independence Day ,  Men in Black ,  and Men in Black 2 ) Last but not least in the overall news subject of news the war in Iraq didn't end, thankfully.  Saddam went on trial along with Kobe Bryant, Martha Stewart, and Michael Jackson.

      Today I was at my grandma's house and hanging out with my cousins. Kevin the wretched always evil jakc@$$. He made a plate the said "Kerry, Edwards President '04". God I hate him the truth about politics is that there all liars and con artist. Your job as a voter is to find the one who lies least or keeps our economy rolling by and means necessary. I think the war in Iraq is great, we'll get cheap gas eventually. We were later playing baseball and I said "This games over once I hit a homerun." to which Kevin replied "Looks like weren't going anywhere." to which I said "Kinda like the Kerry Edwards campaign." Note that Kevin isn't even 13 years old. Other then that I skipped the fest. which was a christian gathering I volunteered for. Well lets see my excuses are no ride, no will to go, Cat wasn't going so I didn't want to. Besides I got shafted again anyway, they gave me sales and I hate selling food, crappy toys, or being some bands bitch boy.

      Man I just remembered I had a post before my computer froze about my neighbors son. Hes being stalked by a gay is what it amounts to. Heres the site. http://wonderboyblog.blogspot.com/2004/08/whos-that-guy.html thats the site. On to the idea of this post. I'm so fucking sick of my family. There all hypocrits. My fathers a condescending asshole, since Tommy got a job I have to hear all this  need a job bullshit. While Tommy gets away with murder till he's 17 just because he gets good grades. "When are you going to start paying for stuff around here I mean your mother just took you school shopping." Yeah cause Tommy only went 2 weeks before me and Catherine 1 week before me. My mother claims my summer school which costed $220 so I cannot by any means necessary be put through driving school (It costs too much.). But Tommy's increasing tution ($5800 a year)  shouldn't be considered, oh wait he was put through driving school. Realize that Tommy's school costed well over $20,000 over not under or close but well over (Freshman year= $4800 Sophomore =$5000 Junior = $5300 Senior = $5800 TOTAL = $20,900) and lets not forget the fact that they want us to sell 4 $30 calenders or foot thge bill ourselves. Bullshit. I cost taxes maybe $120 for public school and lets say $200 for polaris (my vocational school) Hum. Tommy = $20900 Pat = $420 so we can't possibly put me through driving school. Catherine well she just gets everything she wants and in the process intentionaly gets in the way. Tommy, Well I can't blame him for being intellegent but I can blame him for being an ass about it. We've lived in this current residence for 3 years, he has yet to cut the grass once. Come on do some work other then school. Its not that I think I have it so bad, but Jesus Christ when I can't go over Cat's because Catherine needs to spend 2 hours on the phone with that fuck faced whore Julia I tend to get aggrivated. Shit, I ask to see Cat at least twice a week Mondays at bible study and Friday wherever we choose. Fuck this family I think I'll sue for the $20,480 difference I got fucked out of then I'll put myself through car class($300), buy a new Mazda 3 ($16,000) and pay insurance/gas with the last $4180. Also realize that my insurance would be $100 not too bad.

      4. A.A./N.A.    Cause: Help people with drinking / drug problems    Reason they suck: What do you think they do before and after these meetings I've seen it, they drink and do drugs. How effective can you be if your clients are doing what they are there to cure.  5. NAACP    Cause: National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.    Reason they suck: Get your people to read then we'll take you seriously.  6. EAW    Cause: Environmentalists Againast War    Why they suck: Oh, a double whammy. I hate people who bitch about green peace. Also I support the war. This group unified the environmentalists. What a shitty idea, who cares about "US clusterbombs, thermobaric explosions, electromagnetic bursts and weapons made with depleted uranium are indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction.". Boo fucking hoo.  I think that about covers it theres probably a lot more that I just don't feel like taking the time to list. Leave a comment on the ones I forgot.

      So I decided yesterday instead of calling John Kerry a blubbering asswipe, (WHICH HE IS) to actually give him a chance. Well I wasted my time I looked at all his campaign planks and that shit but found nothing that I like. Then I went to G.W.'s site same shit. Other then the war I don't support any of the planks either candidate has. I have yet to go to Ralph Nader's site but I better be impressed. I'm going to look now. Ralph looks like he'd be my vote. He has no chance but every vote counts. And while I'm talking about politics everyone needs to stop bitching about voting machines. Now in Cali. Blacks call punch ballots "discriminatory". Once again I herd that while listening to  The Tavis Smiley Show .

      Okay, I'm experiencing technical difficulties with blogger. But any way heres the list I promised I'll add more later  1. Feminists    Cause: Womens Rights     Reason it sucks: Too many bitchy women complaining about men like their shit don't stink  2. Peta    Cause: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals    Reason it sucks: Too many bitchy people saying killing animals is wrong, but in the process of not eating meat they kill animals through grain harvesting. (special thanks to maddox at www.maddox.xmission.com)  3. Amnesty International    Cause: Human Rights    Reason it sucks: Not everyone deserves human rights.   I've got a party to go to then out to see Cat and the gang so more tomarrow.

      You know for all the bashing I do there are many things I do like that most people would call me a lying asshole for. For instance I tend to like Good Charlottes older music. (i.e. little things, anything from that album) I used to like Simple plan too. Not. Okay maybe I took that one too far. So how about that US Olympic basketball team, they suck. Iraq soccer looks better. Hell we can't even beat Italy. (Being Italian I don't mind) For as much as I usually dislike Arabs, I must say that the Olympics may be just what they need to unite their nation and if it makes them any more respectable I'll stand behind it. Well looks like we (USA) have a shitty team. I'm listening to  The Tavis Smiley  show and their sports commentator is talking about how the American teams are cussing out anyone who beats us. "Its bad that we can't even accept defeat anymore, that we cuss out the better team. It's because we're so used to beating ourselves!" Isn't that true. We won't give "props" to Italy because we're so selfish and worry so much about being the most powerful in the land. I'll admit I'm the haughty American. I think my country could kick and others ass. Why? Because we're America and I'm a piece of this pie. Now lets assume I live in Italy for a minute. What do I think of the Americans? I think their punk ass bitches who can't live without starbucks, MTV, and some shitty teen idol to tell them what to think. Oh wait I all ready think that. For being the most powerful nation we aren't shit. When most of our people won't get off their asses to try to be anything more then middle class we have a problem. When we won't take responsibility for our own actions that's sad. When we're so obsessed with ourselves that we "deserve things" , "You deserve a quality car with an affordable loan no matter what your credit report says". No, actually you don't you have to works your ass off for a nice car and house and even then nothing's guaranteed. If you saw  Office Space   remember when Their talking about if you had a million dollars what would you do? Well they were right it is a bullshit question. I beieve that if someone doesn't fail were all screwed because no one would own a grocery store when they could do somthing better. Same with farming. Lets face it everyone who ever won an arguement was told they'd be a good lawyer, why don't we tell anyone who took out trash they'd be a good garbageman? Oh wait garbage "person" I don't feel like wasting my time on some dumb broad whose hurt because shes not getting her "props" if I say man. Either that or somthing along the lines of me being sexist. So anyway back to other shit. I think after this I'll post a list of people, their position on a subject and why it sucks.

      So today I feel like bonafide shit. Theres nothing to do in my life. I'll bet I feel like shit becuase its summer, but either way I just want to die, theres nothing to do in life. I usually try to stick to other things about society, politics, media, news, or anything else but myself. But today I feel like shit. (do you get the idea?) I miss Cat, and knowing I have to deal with this stupid fucking party tomarrow at my aunt Heidi's. My moms brother-in-laws family blows so much ass. Not just because there annoying as hell but mainly because they bring their ugly ass dogs. All dogs but mine suck ass. No animals Besides human deserve to live. Oh yeah, the reason I made this title. So now I'm lying in my Basement and feel a little better. The End I hope you all die. Not that anyone but me reads this. Well except Beans and Cat started to the other day. Oh shit now not only is my least favorite movie,  Austin Powers  on but now my mom says I act like Doctor Evil which is partly true because I am evil as clown at AA.
