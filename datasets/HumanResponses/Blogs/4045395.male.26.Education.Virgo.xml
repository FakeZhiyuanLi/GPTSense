      After an entire day of thought, a simple moment smoking a cigarette revealed a little of what I thought this imperative might mean. While it's a little vague, I think that keeping the gods alive by thinking of them does them honor. One doesn't have to run to the heights and proclaim their existance. Nor, even, tout their meaning and importance to others through testimony of their roles in my life.   However much I might think of the them though, benevolent parents, I still did nothing to participate in the blue moon tonight. Does this make me a bad participant? Again this question of what are trappings of the religion and what is active faith. I spent the day in thought. Is it enough? What is? Should I spend of portion of each day sitting in front of candle meditating? How much time is enough? I know that only I can answer any of these questions based on my needs.  What's missing? Isn't this a question we all come to every now and then?  Today was the first day in a long time that I have felt overwhelmed by life's responsibilities. Many things to do for many people. Everyone of them pulling me their direction with claims of the importance of their need. That's just complaining. Never enough time. I am so tired.  I will set aside a day or two more for this first statement. The others that follow seem given to obviousness.

      This evening, I did my absolute best to search for a site entertaining the idea that Wicca should be as simple as possible. The web is destistute of much other that retail and people doing their best to rehash what has already been said in the book market. However, the search did prove helpful for something I want to try.  The title of the post says it. This particular site first examines the Rede (several versions) and compares the underlying hegemony. Loved it. It does give perspective and only agreed with everything that I had already felt about the Craft and magic. To simply believe that a person can begin manipulating events, people, and life willy-nilly IS ludicrous. No matter what good we might do in order to balance the situation. Karma, or the Rule of Three doesn't allow for us to pick and choose where we pay our debt. The lender always decides the APR and I doubt that the God/dess will allow us to choose our own payback.   However, neither here nor there with where I am going.  Further down the page (and is it lengthy) are several (87) items that someone new to the path might see as "ardanes" to life in Wicca. Beginning with "honor the Gods." Until I feel that I have found some true meaning in my own life for this one simple imperative, I will not move on to the second. An exercise in futility? No, sitting still much longer is my own version of futility.  So beginning tomorrow (today)I will find space in my life for this simple exercise.  1. Honor the Gods, for They are the channels and the manifestation of the Source. Honor yourself, for this force also lies within you. Love the Gods as They love you, and by loving yourself and your brothers and sisters, so the Gods shall honor you. As the love and joy of a man and a woman [or "lover and beloved" -- LAH] flowers and grows when nurtured with respect, and cultivated with understanding and honor, so should you love the Gods.   from: http://www.unc.edu/~reddeer/gs_course/rede.html  Stay tuned to find out how this particular journey goes.

       urlLink   How does a person define their spirituality and why it's important to them? I have had more than my share of special moments where I have felt touched by the divine. I have seen others touched by the divine, hell I have even been touched by the divine in others. Yet, what I feel lost about is my participation. How much of spirituality is simply trappings?  Are trappings, clothes, candles, holidays, and relgio-speak? Can I still say that I participate in my own chosen religion if I do not actively do those things that books tell me means that I am what they are attempting to define as being ______? I do not like to follow the letters in a book alone. Religion comes from within and I could create my own definitions, but it doesn't compete with the feeling that overwhelms me when more than I are invovled.  Time and again, I have turned away from one person, group or another for whatever reason. Something turns me off, something turns me away, something says,&nbsp;"not again." Is it so hard for us not in the mainstream easy-to-define religions to participate with one another. There's a disturbing trend that pushes solitary on us, saying that it's a viable alternative to finding a group to learn, grow, and love in. I disagree.   I don't believe that any one person can say, you Journeyman, have attained the level of _____ in our spirituality and here's your symbol of that attainment. But my agreement with being solitary stops there. Being solitary isn't about going it alone. It's about self-reliance. Our spirituality lost the message somewhere in there that it's our (each of us) own responsibility to see our life knowledge grow. No one can do that for us.   People can be symbolic of lessons along the way, yes. But still solitary will leave us wholly alone. No true thing worth doing is made worse by doing it in numbers ;) . So where are the people desparate to find one another so that we can form groups of two, three, four, five, seven, nine, and thirteen? Where are the people clamoring to share their own specialties in herbalism, candles, writing, et al? Where?  Self-reliance once again rears its ugly head and lo! 101 Classes are full of brag brag brag, and I can, and I did, and you should let me teach you to... One of the foundations of teaching in our spirituality is the request. The Gardnerians and Alexandrians, and other trads.&nbsp;are not wrong in their belief that time must tell if a person is ready to learn. Even then, these trads don't believe that they should shove information off on a person. It's the person's responsibilty to see the information kept. It's the group's responsibilty to see the person through it, to help them deal with the gravity of the knowlege they're taking on. Sure we share, sure we teach. But it's more about the relationships grown. Are you willing to suffer, so that you may learn? Don't you?  A seed is not happy in itself knowing that it can become a tree. A seed is not happy in itself mentally running through the exercises&nbsp;of itself taking root.&nbsp; A seed works with its family:&nbsp;water, earth, and air, to be a tree.&nbsp;  Journeyman&nbsp; urlLink

       How many people begin a blog in the hope that one day, they might be well read? Is it another exercise in futility? The strangest thing is that I don't believe that I have viewed anyone else's blog before deciding to begin one of my own. Who knows, maybe in all those searches on the net I have seen them and never known it.&nbsp; And you know, I would like to share a link to my MSN profile, but I don't want to see all that garbage that follows an address. SO, look for me under the same nick in MSN people. Or heck, drop me a line and find out.     What's the purpose in posting when I have nothing real to say? My life, my woes? I can't say that I even rant anymore...thanks to anti-depressants. That could be a rant. How many of us are on them?     &nbsp;   I always believed that I could conquer anything if I only set my mind to it. However, the past eight months have shown me otherwise. You can never know that you really have a problem until the problem is gone. What does it mean - generalized anxiety disorder? Oh, I know all the definitions, I own a copy of the DSM and work in a library.     &nbsp;   On the whole, my life is better. I don't worry nearly as much as I used to. And let me tell you, I worried a lot. I could spend hours jotting down rants into my little spiral bound notebooks about anything at all. And I never did anything about it. Any of it. I'd rather have sat and let it fester and put on the closest woe is me CD.     &nbsp;   Is it over? Nah, the difference is that I don't develop ulcers over it. With the worry out of the way, I can take care of some things without too much to-do. I guess that I still feel like I have put a band-aid over top of a leaky faucet. Welcome to the century of the quick fix presciption and life long addiction folks.     &nbsp;   There is so much going on anymore. Why can't we simplify? Has anyone read Starhawk's  The Fifth Sacred Thing ? Ah, despite all the adversity the protagonists suffer, the simplicity of living portrayed is one I believe we all might want. (holds glass up) Here's to simplicity! Cheers.

      Over the years of following the Wiccan path, I have asked this question several times over. I have even heard female pagans ask this too. When I first began exploring Witchcraft/Paganism in elementary school, I could only find books on spells, hexes, history, and the like. By the time that I made it to junior high school and picked up the tarot, there was still no appreciable material on Wicca and its theistic structure. Mind you, this was also before the true advent of the internet when computers began to quickly appear in many of our homes. By the time that my best friend got her driver’s license, I had already planned the trips to Nashville’s bookstores that we would take. So, I suppose that I learned the name Wicca my freshman year of high school. Already, I had burned through the public library, the school library, and local bookstores looking for more information on mysticism and witchcraft. At this point, I was only a history buff as far as being a witch is concerned.  Now that we are back in time, I will continue with my diatribe. The day that I walked into Hickory Hollow Mall’s B. Dalton Booksellers and picked up my first copy of Cunningham’s Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner, was a momentous one. Here was exactly what I had been looking for from the media. Years of watching Hollowood’s bent on the Craft, and grossly distorted accounts of history by acceptable authors of the local library council, left me wholly unprepared for what Wicca/Paganism/Witchcraft is today. Even in Cunningham’s introduction of his hugely popular book he writes, “Anyone interested in learning “The Craft” had to content themselves with hints from books and articles.” I had never thought that I would be switching faiths altogether.   From the beginning, Cunningham outlines the religion of Wicca, its roots in shamanism, and (more importantly) chapter two jumps head first into “The Deities.” Being inundated with information on spells and ritual in the past, I jumped straight to those sections at the back of the book that pertained to the “how” of it all. With no one to guide me, I was left to make a paradigm shift on my own. The Wiccan path determines itself for us. In other words, it’s my belief that simply deciding to discover more about Wicca forces us to see Wicca in a different light than we originally might have thought.  Back to the theistic structure of the Craft. Cunningham quickly jumps into a Witch’s relationship with her/his deity. Coming from monotheistic - patriarchal backgrounds (well, most of us do) it is easy to continue seeing the God as someone who is quiet, maybe fatherly, and most often removed from our day-to-day lives. Coming from an oppressive patriarchal religion (not that we all do), we’ll ignore him altogether and concentrate on our all loving and motherly archetype of the Goddess. Look around any New Age/Metaphysical Bookstore and it seems that even the jewelry has a better selection of the Goddess, than the God.   Just as no one can dictate what type of personality a goddess has for you, no one can dictate a god for you. Borrowing from Taoist philosophy, I have the feeling that balance between the two is key. If you have named your goddess and god after the Greek, Mesopotamian, Hindu, or Celtic backgrounds you may have discovered the differing personalities of them all. Some are wrathful goddesses, some are loving and motherly. The same story can be found for the god, there are dark gods, sun gods, fatherly gods, gods of music and revelry, so many we might not know what to do. Truly, how close or removed is our relationship to our makers? What is their role in our lives?  These questions determine more than one might first realize when picking up that first book on Wicca, Santeria, or Paganism  So, am I touting the importance of a male counter part or waxing on whether we understand our personal relationship with our deity? Both are correct; the two questions might be considered inseparable. If we lump all the responsibility onto our goddess, she will surely rebound with so many responsibilities on her plate. She already has to over see all things green (I follow a Celtic pantheon) so why would I also ask her to oversee the animals? When I lay out a tarot spread, I ask the goddess to provide me with the intuition to see the story, and the god to allow me to cut through to the heart of the matter.   Each has their own share of responsibility in dolling out life lessons. In ritual, the goddess affords me the protection I ask, the god is my stalwart – the actual conduit behind the energies I am working with. She is the river and he is the bank. Neither one is complete without the other. To give more substance to our mother and not equal with our father is an imbalanced path to walk.

      Being a smoker and driving taking up the better part of my workday, I have (until recently) been throwing cigarettes out of my window. Berated from various other pagans for my lack of care for our planet, I would make excuses. “Using the ashtray is too much trouble, it stinks up the car, and filters are biodegradable.”    Having a resource-protecting life partner is frustrating, but enlightening. Frustrating because it requires me to rethink how I live my life. I now have to separate plastics, crush aluminum, tin, break down cardboard, never put food in the trash can, use less water in the bathroom, and the list goes on. Protecting our earth isn’t about what’s easiest. After all, who wants to spend time dividing out the plastic from the aluminum, deliver it to another location than the end of our driveway? Or take a shorter shower, use kerosene lighting instead of all electric, or pay more for gas powered refrigerators, stoves, water heaters, and wash all food containers out? Let us not even touch on learning about solar power…oops.   Yet, more than simply being a pagan, we are (most of the time) environmentalists. What can I do, I am only one person? What difference can I make if I am one of the less than ten percent who care? More than simply caring for mama in our own way, we should feel obligated to educate and lead by example. Otherwise, aren’t we simply giving lip service to being Pagan, Wiccan, etc.? If every vista is a sanctuary and the forest our chapel, shouldn’t we be keeping it clean?  Again on the crusade of shaping up my own life, I have quit kvetch-ing about cigarette butts in my ashtray. Part of this is due in fact to having read Starhawk’s The Fifth Sacred Thing. Quite apart from being an incredible writer of pagan how to literature, Starhawk is quite a tale spinner. She paints a futuristic view of the world (specifically, California) where many starve or die from dehydration. The earth is now depleted of more ozone and natural resources. While not touching on what actually happened to the U.S. government, she writes of a totalitarian local government where racism is a matter-of-course and rations are all anyone gets to eat.   However, the story’s main character, Madrone, lives with many others including Pagans, Radical Fairies, Christians, Catholics, Native Americans, Buddhists, etc. in harmony with their surroundings. In fact, the concrete streets and parking lots have been destroyed by the people who refused to be oppressed any longer. Communal living, acceptance, and consensus are the way everyone lives. No one has the concept of private property. However, the southern government has ignored the socialism occurring in the north bay area long enough and has plans to move in.   Leaving you there, I urge you to find a copy. Better yet, urge your local New Age/Metaphysical store owner to stock it. The story will give all readers a new view of conservation and care for the four of the five sacred things: earth, air, fire, and water. So, back to the matter at hand. What can each of us do? We could all use a nightly walk through our neighborhood. Why not pick up street trash? (wry smile) Walk through a local park and pick up litter. Better yet, go to your local superstore and begin picking up litter. See what the public thinks about that. Recycling isn’t just about the waste we produce by eating either. Those jeans you don’t fit into anymore might fit someone else now. That sweater that has a hole in it can be mended, or even made into another purpose. That faded, hole-ridden favorite shirt might become material for napkins or a pomander. What about being a recycler in an area that doesn’t have decent facilities? Here are a couple of tips and resources to begin with.  • Color code, label or put pictures on containers, so small children can help sort recyclables. Show them how to separate plastics by using the num-bers on the bottoms of the containers. • Reduce the volume of tin cans. Remove paper labels, rinse, drip-dry in a dish drainer, cut off both ends, then step on them to mash them flat. • Have necessary supplies at hand such as twine for bundling newspapers (check local regulations). Use step-top cans that allow hands-free disposal. • Arrange storage containers at a convenient height for sorting recyclables, perhaps placing them on a table or bench. Put containers on carts or dollies to make moving easier. • If containers will be “on display,” find ways to make them attractive. Use old paint or wallpaper to match the room decor. Hide open-topped con-tainers behind folding doors, blinds, roller shades, or curtains. • Keep storage areas free of insects and odors. Take materials to the recycling center frequently, or move them to a long-term storage area outside. Find a safe place for storing hazardous wastes until the items can be taken to a community clean-up day. (Contact your county extension office for more information about hazardous wastes.) • Make regular trips to the redemption center a part of your shopping routine. Use paper bags on shelves, in deep drawers, or stand them on the floor. A standard grocery bag is just the right size to hold newspapers. • Ask local stores for cardboard boxes. Line with old plastic bags to keep the cardboard dry. • Obtain moving cartons (boxes or barrels used for moving household goods). • Get fiberboard barrels from bakeries or milk-processing plants. • Hang a laundry bag on a hook and fill it with soft drink cans or plastic milk jugs. The bag will be easy to carry when full. • Use old plastic bags for collecting recyclables. • Coffee cans are convenient for holding small, plastic lids, kitchen utencils, pencils, nails, screws. Jars of any kind are a reason I buy products. I reuse all my jars for candles, screws, powder incenses, herbs, sugar, homemade soups,  • A piece of furniture, such as a buffet or window seat, could become a recycling center. • A basket, crock, or antique boiler could hold newspapers in the family room. • A table or rolling cart in the basement or laundry room could be used for sorting recyclables. • Laundry baskets or tubs, wooden fruit baskets, or old kitchen cabinets could have new life as recy-cling storage units.  http://www.rutherfordcounty.org/recycle/other.htm  this page gives listings for various locations in Rutherford County, including Kroger’s, Inc. that has quite an aggressive recycling program.  http://www.state.tn.us/environment/  believe it or not, our state has a recycling program in place. this site is a wonderful resource for information for Tennessee citizens.   http://www.epa.gov/recyclecity/mainmap.htm  This is a fun place for kids to explore. Not just for kids, I had a blast playing around in Recycle City where the citizens have several ways that they not only recycle, but reuse common items. Check this one out!  I apologize for not having "clickable" links, but I am afraid that blogger.com doesn't supppor it. You will have to copy and paste the addresses into you browser's address bar.

      Given any thought to the idea that all information, no matter the source or the message, is completely meaningless until it is needed or questioned by someone (or thing) of intellegence? So, despite all the import of being a librarian and harboring information, if no one is there to read it - does it exist?  When we have been wiped from this planet, like so many small bacterium on a recently cleaned surface, what will it all add to? Who will care and to what end will its existence come? What medium is there that will stand the test of time, forever?   Even though we might find artifacts of times and civilisations long gone, what do we know of them? Would they find comfort in the things we know of them? Truly doubtful. Especially given that there are civilisation like the Nazca for which we truly know nothing about.   Oh yes, we can use modern anthropoligical methods to hypothesize that this piece of pottery was for water. Or, that blanket with small knitted people marching around the outside edge like an army of ants singularly going nowhere, yet intricate enough that each minuscule person is individual from the rest - was a death shroud.   Its easy to imagine that all that the people had become is small recompense for the lives they actually lived, the challenges overcome, the mysteries they knew as common knowlege.   Weep for the passage of time, for no one is immune, and all will fall to her beauty.  Saying so, does this mean that too that information can be true and still be wrong? Is it nihilistic to say that all study, no matter how virtuous in helping our race is useless? How far can it go?   Soy nada, tengo nada. Usted es nada, somos nada. Nada, nada, nada.

      I wake for an hour each night, sometimes more. I cruise the net, smoke and wonder. Strangely enough this new spiritual "cycle" has gone hand in hand with a new series I ordered for the library, and a need for creative output. "Fire-Us: The Kindling" by Armstrong and Butcher has me thinking about those dreams I had so long ago.   I wouldn't call this insomnia. I don't know what to call it. I just feel directionless. Again.  Back to bed.
