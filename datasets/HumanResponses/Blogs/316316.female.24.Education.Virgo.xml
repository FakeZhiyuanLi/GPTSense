      OK, so I suck at this...  Today is a very exciting day in the Mitchell-Harnett household. We just got our dog, Chance. His name was Champ at the rescue, but we figured a small change would be OK. He seems to be doing OK with being here so far, though he's only been here for about an hour. He is already asleep on the office floor while both Mark and I click away at our computers. That can't possibly be a bad sign.   I'm apprehensive about having a dog--the mess, the responsibility, the cost, all that. But it is already making Mark so happy that I'm glad we're doing it, and I think I am going to grow very attached to this dog very quickly as well. He's just so damn likeable. He is a big boy (103 lbs), tall, well proportioned, gorgeous. And he's so mellow and kind, at least so far. Reminds me quite a bit of my stepmother's old dog, Kahn, and that is definitely a good thing.  Other than that, not much going on. We did a lot of home repair type stuff this weekend (finally painted and covered the bench, moved some stuff around, put some pictures up) and I'm very happy with the results. This place has really come together.  And I'm worried about money, of course. I got my financial aid check and it seems to have rapidly disappeared. It didn't disappear, of course--I put some in savings and paid my credit card bill and all that fun stuff, but I'm still apprehensive about how much I have to live on in the next year. I'm sure it will be fine, but I can't help but worry. I really hope the internship at Texans Care for Children works out, but I am very much lacking hope currently.  I am going to apply to whatever private scholarships I can find, though, especially if I am not working. Even a $500 scholarship will make a lot of difference. Someone on the Ms. boards posted a link to a Third Wave Foundation scholarship, so I'll start there.

      Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday dear me, happy birthday to meeeeeee!  So today is my 24th birthday. I don't really feel like it's my birthday, but the calendar assures me that it is. It's stange how much less exciting birthdays get as you get older. I still try to maintain my childlike level of birthday excitement, because being excited about things is fun, but it feels kind of fake. Especially this year. 24 is my last birthday before the serious ages begin, as far as I can tell. Next year, I'm a quarter century; after that I enter my late 20s. Then 30s, then 40s, etc. I'm not particularly afraid to age (that's just a boldfaced lie, actually I am afraid to age, but I know I shouldn't be), but turning 12 seemed a lot more magical than turning 24.   Be that as it may, I'm going to try to enjoy my "special day." If nothing else, at least there will be presents, and we're going out to a nice dinner with Susan and Tony.   Having a 9am class on my birthday is probably not helping me feel celebratory. Perhaps my post-class nap will change my mood. :)

      Classes start in less than an hour and I am jittery. Too jittery to write anything worth reading.

      I'm slacking off already, I guess.  Classes start tomorrow. I wish I felt more anticipation than dread, but I don't. I'm getting bogged down in the financial mire again, too. I need to not let it get to me--with my loans and everything I will be OK. Still, it worries me. I would really prefer not to have to live hand-to-mouth all semester (though I know that what I am thinking of as I type "hand-to-mouth" is a really rich white Westerners version thereof and I should be ashamed to complain about it).   I am going to try to build some time into my schedule to get into the fitness center(s) on campus and maybe take some classes. I ought to be ashamed of how out of shape I am at my age. Since all logic tells me my problems (back, legs, whatever) are going to get worse and not better, I really need to start being a bit proactive about this stuff. I know it sounds funny to say this at two-days-shy-of-24, but I'm not getting any younger. So I paid the fee that allows me to take whatever classes I want for this semester and hopefully I can drag my ass to kickboxing or yoga or pilates or something a couple of times a week.  I'd like to find a new pottery class, too, but perhaps I'd better take it one step at a time before I go completely overloading my schedule.  It looks like we may be getting a dog sooner rather than later. Mark fell in love with a dog off a rescue site and he's coming for a home visit this weekend. He's a German Shepard-Rott-Swissy. He weighs 103 lbs and from his picture he is beautiful. Mark talked to his foster mom on the phone yesterday and she couldn't say enough good things about him, so I guess we'll see where that goes. Getting a dog might be a great thing for my needing to get into better shape, too. I imagine it's a workout to walk a 100+ pound dog, whether he's obedient or not.  Unforunately, classes are starting on my heaviest day, Wednesday. I have Public Financial Management from 10:30-12 and Polical Economy from 2-5. I'm a bit perturbed about the length of my classes (I have two three-hour classes, two hour and a half classes and one four hour class every week). I always hated the longer classes at Reed, and they weren't any longer than my shortest classes here will be. Let's hope graduate school is different, or the temptation to skip class is going to start awfully early.  I hope it doesn't, though. I don't want to skip class. At this point in my education, it seems really counterproductive and stupid to do so.   My used Political Economy book cost $80. Bah. I haven't bought any of the rest of my books yet.

      A member of a message board I frequent asked a question today (or maybe yesterday?) about how one knows when one is bisexual. My response, which was as honest as I can get on this subject, was that restricting my feelings for people based on their gender simply makes no sense to me. It's not just nonsensical, though, it feels like bigotry. To me, restricting attraction or romantic feeling based on gender really does make about as much sense as restricting it based on race.  The problem is that I think my outlook on this can (easily) be read as very inflammatory and even insulting by people who are not bisexual. I mean, basically I'm calling them bigots, right? That can't be good. And I really hate that aspect of it. I don't think it's my place to judge anyone's sexuality, but if I am going to be perfectly honest, I have to say that heterosexuality and homosexuality really make very very little sense to me. Homosexuality for women makes some sense for political reasons, but as far as actually only being attracted to women...I don't get it.  Ug. This is confusing stuff. I should really start reading some bi-theory, but I am afraid it will only piss me off more.  I went shopping for several hours today. My main objective was to get Mark's birthday present (accomplished!), but I had to go to a bunch of places and get stuff for our office, etc. as well. It was a complete nightmare. Target was brim-full of incoming U Texas freshlings buying plastic shit they don't need for their dorm rooms. Oddly, I wasn't jealous of them like I expected to be. Mostly, I was relieved that part of my life is over. Man, I must be getting old.  Speaking of old, I will be 24 in just a few short days. How weird is that? 24 is, undeniably, mid-20s. And Mark will be 26! I don't know how we got so grown up.  The ongoing conversations about the future dog make me feel pretty grown up as well. We're actually going to take care of another living being. A mammal. A companion. It's a big step. I think we're ready, but it makes me nervous.  We've also decided to open a joint checking account for household expense. Shit. We're practically married. :P

      Woo-hoo! I have another interview for Monday afternoon. That's two and I have barely started trying. I'm thrilled! This one is with the Texas Fair Trade Commission, which represents labor organizations, so it's just about as in-line with my interests as the other one. Yay!  Orientation activities today were a colossal waste of time and I skipped out early. I hate how orientation by definition seems to mean being treated like a child. But it's all over now. I don't think I skipped anything "mandatory," so it should be OK. This writing workshop really blew my mind, though. It was at imbecile level and was an insult to everyone there. Plus, the woman running really seemed to be stoned. Very strange.  Tonight is the big beginning of the year banquet thing. I bought some shoes on my way home (I drove myself to campus, yay!), so I think I'll be able to dress respectably enough. Actually, it starts in an hour, so we should probably start thinking about what we're wearing. Open bar, I hear.  Mark talks to his parents on the phone like twice a week at least. It's so damn odd.  I have to figure out what to get Mark for his birthday. Ag. I have some ideas, but nothing is really jumping out as me. Must be time for an E-bay visit.

      These things suck: 1. Registering for classes at 8am online on a first-come first-serve basis. Ick. 2. Mark having stomach cramps so I have to drive myself to campus (and take the scary highway!). 3. Having what promise to be remarkably worthless orientation sessions today (library orientation, writing center orientation) marked on my schedule as "MANDATORY." 4. Not having any reasonable clothes for the big dress up beginning of the year reception tonight. 5. Wanting to go back to bed when I have been up for less than a hour. 6. My constantly smudged glasses.  These things rule: 1. I got three of the four classes I want (this sort of sucks also, though, because I did not get my perfect schedule in which I would only have to be on campus Mon-Wed and never before 10:30am) 2. Entemann's coffee cake for breakfast 3. Having my head feel so much lighter with only a couple of inches chopped off my hair. 4. The promise of a big financial aid check sometime next week. 5. Already having a job interview 6. My new cell phone, which remains charged for more than 5 minutes at a time and is very swanky looking (and you can write your own ring melody on it, something Mark has forbade me to do).

      Today's big news is that I got my assingment for my PRP. PRP stands for Policy Research Project, and it's a year-long project, culiminating in the publication of a book or articles or professional report, on any one of several subjects. Yesterday we had a PRP Expo in which all of the faculty who are leading PRPs told us what their specific projects would be about. Then we turned in preferences and today we got our assingments. I got my first choice.  Have I bit off more than I can chew?  My PRP is called Regulation of Gender II, and the sheet I have in front of me has this to say: "In 2003-04 we hope to have team members author creative policy proposals by developing a series of political analogies that could apply to people who don't perfectly fit the enforced binary gender system. Current policies might be addressed in terms of: treatment of visibile minorities (un)equal opportunities for persons with Disabiltiies protection of human research subjects separation of Church and State Freedom of Expression and Association (1st Amendment)"  Basically, the course is about how to best make policy concerning intersexed individuals when "gender binarism is actively maintained by public politics."  I'm so excited I could just wet myself.  Tomorrow at 8am I register for my other three classes. I am hoping to get into Political Economy, Political Financial Management and Political Administration.   Between this and my job interview on Tuesday (yay!), I feel like I am really doing quite well. Life is good.

      Grocery shopping should be simple, right?  Tell that to Mark. I let him go by himself (cuz I hate grocery shopping, particularly with him) and he is gone for 2 hours and spends $150. To feed two people for a week! It's fucking ridiculous. He has no concept of reasonable shopping. He came home with bags and bags of stuff, some of it logical, some of it more on the $5 lobster mushroom continuum (yes, he paid 5 freaking dollars for one mushroom).  How do we get around this? The money is a problem, the excess is a problem...but food is his think and I don't want to try to take that away from him (especially because I sure as hell don't want to cook). My current solution is that we decide what a reasonable amount to spend per month on food is and I give him half that amount. He does the shopping and if he goes over the amount we agreed on, he pays the difference. This would work because it would put the impetus on him to change, and I wouldn't have to be worried constantly about grocery bills. Seems reasonable. But will it work?

      I haven't been up this early in quite awhile. It sucks just as much as I remember it sucking. Especially since I've basically been awake since about 5am. Fucking first day jitters. And it's really dumb to have them today, too, because all I am doing is going to convocation and getting my freaking picture taken. I don't have to DO anything except find the right rooms. I even had first day jitters dreams. Ug.  I also had a sex dream about one of my best female friends (if any of my female friends are reading this, it wasn't you). Very strange. This is someone for whom I've always had some attraction, but nothing too earth shattering. And it's the first sex dream I've had in forever. Very strange. Gotta have some release for my inner lesbian, I suppose.  Which reminds me that I should get my usual lengthy bisexual rant down in this blog soon, just for fun. But not now. It's too early.  Also, I have split ends.

      Hrm. Orientation starts tomorrow and I should be excited, but I'm not. I really would rather just stay home, paint some more furniture, etc. Hopefully I will be more into once I get there. I am interested to see what my class schedule is going to look like, what sort of research opportunities there are going to be, etc., but I don't want to get up early and have to be there and all that.  How did I get so fucking lazy in only a couple of weeks?  I'm noticing that I am posting a lot of self-centered blah blah blah and no real substance here. Hopefully that will change with time. I really do have thoughts, I just have gotten way way out of practice at recording them. (And and writing without excessive :) and :( all the time).   On the message boards I post to, someone is being really mean and vile to me. This has happened before and it will happen again, but my skin doesn't seem to be getting any thicker. I always come back to questioning myself, even though I am positive that I'm in the right. I have to cultivate some sense of not caring about things and people that don't matter, but I haven't done it yet.  If you haven't done it yet, subscribe to Bitch. It's a good publication and it needs help.  Yeah, right. Like there is someone reading this.  I need ideas for a really spectacular birthday present for Mark, followed by a really spectacular anniversary present. Anybody got any ideas?   Speaking of anniversaries, it was the one year wedding anniversary of one of my very favorite couples on Earth this past weekend. Just the thought of that makes me giddily happy for a moment. I love people who are in love.

      Today on "things overheard while Mark is watching TV in the next room":  "I'm never going in the water. The ocean can suck my ass."  He seems to be watching film of sharks attacking people. His viewing habits are...strange.  I've renewed my love of Ebay. So far, the damage is slight, but I'm having increasing trouble restraining myself. Why is it that whenever I have the least money, I feel the need to spend the most money? It makes no sense.  I wonder if anyone is reading this? I somehow doubt it, yet the idea that someone might be does sort of keep me on my toes with regards to putting periods at the ends of my sentances and making some attempt to spell correctly. Which is good, I think.  We've moved our furniture painting operation out on to the front porch because things dry so much faster outside, so I really should be trying to clean up the sunroom (where we were painting before). Once it is cleaned up and put together, the whole house will be in some semblance of order. Not a bad place to be with less that two weeks' residency, I think.  But I'm blathering on here rather than actually cleaning it up. Funny how that works.  I'm hungry. I'm hungry all the time now. I know it's because I am not eating enough or often enough, yet I do nothing to remedy it. I'm actually in some sick way sort of starting to enjoy the feeling of being hungry. That has to be a bad sign.

      Another day in the continual quest to find some place to put my anger. But the anger just comes, as Ani says. Today's bout is over what I feel is an unfair withholding of some of our security deposit from our former landlord and Erica's subsequent email stating that she thought that since the bulk of what we left behind (some boxes and a box spring, basically) wasn't her's, she should have her entire portion of the deposit refunded.   This pisses me off on so many levels I hardly know where to begin. First, the landlord. Even if we did leave a few things we shouldn't have behind (I'll cop to the box spring being inappropriate, but I think the boxes, left out with the recycling, were fine and the place was DAMN clean), the apartment was in WAY WAY WAY better shape when we left than it was when we moved in. When we moved in, it was a disaster. We had to clean it from top to bottom, and the people who moved out before us left way way more stuff that we had to deal with than we ever thought of leaving. So I think it is unfair. And I think she's just being cheap. The note she sent us with our partial refund said that she was witholding $120 from our refund because she worked for 7 hours at $15/hr and had to pay a $15 dump fee to clean up waht we'd left. So it's not much money, given the size of the deposit. And there is absolutely no way it took her seven hours to break down some boxes...  The whole thing sets my teeth on edge. Adn the fact that I can't just let it go sets them even farther on edge. Ug. Why can't I just write stuff like this off? It's an extra $40-$60 (depending on Erica). It's not the end of the world.  But my heart rate increases, I can't sleep, I grit my teeth, and I am generally angry. And so I continue to look for a place to put my anger. And I continue to be totally unable to find one.  School starts in like a week and a half. I am totally unprepared to be a graduate student. Who the fuck am I kidding?   And I should get a job and really really don't want to. Not wanting to makes me feel lazy and shiftless.  Just another day in the great life of Grace's self esteem.

      We went to this strange little theatre production the other night with Susan and Tony. It was an exploration of communication using only "H" words (and so the playwright told us at the end, rendering all other interpretations of the previous 45 minutes null and void--I hate it when they do that). Anyway, it has me thinking in "H" words. Here are some good ones that they didn't use: histrionics hieroglyph hemmorhage heliotrope  The word the play ended with was "hope." If it had been a lot more subtle, I would have liked that. Most of the time, I think hope is really all there is.

      "As if sexuality is a game like that!"  Mark's reaction to "Boy Meets Boy." I have to agree, and to admire him for his distaste.  I have decided to start blogging. I hear all the cool kids are doing it. Seriously, I'm trying to get back into some form of self-discipline as a writer, and my old-school journaling just isn't cutting it. I can't write long-hand anymore. Depressing. So hopefully I can introduce a few friends of mine to this blog and have somewhat of a writing support group.  Or at least write without hand cramps.   An online friend of mine has a really really excellent blog that I just read a month's worth of entries. She's inspiring me. Thanks, Flea.  Anyways...we now have way way more cable channels than we ought. I think this bodes ill for my school future. We even have the BBC and IFC and...  Uh oh.

      Yea gods I am exhausted. I should not be this tired. I must be getting old.  Had a very nice dinner tonight with Susan and Tony. It's so nice that Mark likes to cook. It would be nicer if he liked to clean up, too, but you can't win 'em all.  I need to go read some econ but I know I'll be asleep before I get through two pages, much less two chapters. Tales of a dedicated student...  I just looked down and realized that I forgot to put a real shirt on before Susan and Tony came over and you can pretty much see my nipples through the tank top I have on. Shit. Uncouth. I hope they weren't offended.

      So here is the problem I see with having an online journal that your friends know about, rather than a private, nobody-reads-this journal:  You can't complain about your lack of sex life.   Well, you can, but you'll be roundly and rightly accused of giving TMI to the people who you know might be reading your blog.  Must find a way around this issue.

      This morning has a very Sunday kind of feel about it. Mark is off walking Chance; when he gets back we'll go on an errand run (grocery shopping, Target, etc.) Then later we have a play date with Chance and Tosca, and Mark wants to make a Sunday fried chicken dinner. What could be better?  The only problem is that my neck is hurting like a mofo again. Dammit. I am trying to figure out if it's better with my hair up or better with my hair down, but I think it would be better with my hair off completely.  My interest in actually doing the reading for my classes next week has dwindled to sort of a sad trickle. I did the reading for my Monday night class, but haven't cracked a book for any of the others, and it doesn't look like there will be tons of time to do that today. Oh well, at least I had four weeks at the beginning of the semester of pretending I am a dedicated student.   I wonder if anyone is reading this thing? I kind of feel sorry for them if they are--it is so rambling and so very uninteresting.  Someone on the Ms. boards called me inauthentic the other day. Is inauthentic even a word? I felt like an imposter Van Gogh painting or something.   Today's shopping delimma: Does (fruit flavored) nonfat yogurt WITHOUT artifical sweetners in it exist? If so, why can't I find it?  Things that say Sunday morning to me: The Sunday Times Waking up with the sun streaming on to your bed Sitting around in pjs or whatever passes for them for hours before you take a shower A long slow stretch and the feeling that although you should probably do something productive, you don't really have to The church bell down the street

      Chance barfed up a sock this morning. A whole freaking sock. Not even one of those little quarter sized socks. Nasty nasty nasty. How can something with a digestive system no bigger than mine swallow an entire goddamn sock??  Susan and I went to see The Magdalene Sisters last night. Heavy, depressing stuff, but one of the best made films I've seen in awhile. It struck that balance, being heavy enough to be realistic and to keep you interested and concerned about what was going on, but having a few moments of levity so that you didn't turn off completely because it was 2 hours of nonstop depressing. I really liked it. I want to read a book about that situation now.  Interesting trend of anti-Catholic movies. One of the previews last night was for the new film Luther (about, duh, Martin Luther). Not exactly blockbuster stuff, but very interesting to me. I wonder if I will outgrow my love/hate/obsession with Catholicism?  I started writing the article about the Ms. boards I've had in the back of my head for so long. So far it's unmitigated crap, but hopefully it will get better. I'd like to come up with something I could be proud of and actually submit it to a few places (Bitch, maybe?). That would be an actual worthwhile use of my time, unlike participating in the snarkfests and battles that are raging over there. I am on open-ended hiatus from there now. So far it's been only about 24 hours, and I already miss posting (and I'm still lurking). I'm an addict, it's that simple.  All boils down, I think, to the fact that I need more friends in my real life and better communication with myf riends who are far away. Having a giant and semi-diverse Internet community is so much EASIER, though, even if I am not getting what I need.  I should stop babbling. There is laundry to do, coffee cake to eat, a dog to walk, football to watch, and all of next week's reading to do somewhere in between. And it's already nearly noon.  I fucking love Saturday.

      Ugggg....so tired.  I really like the job, but working in the same place for eight hours straight is something I didn't miss. I'm glad I am only doing a full day once a week. Half days are much easier. I am really only productive for four hours or so anyway. I might be better off to do 4 1/2 days...have to think about that.  I get paid with no taxes taken out, though. Woo-hoo! I'm sure I'll regret that in the spring, but live it up now, right? Actually it should add up to little enough that it shouldn't be an issue in the spring (I think). No state income tax here, either.  There is a thread on the Ms. boards right now that is driving me fucking nuts. It's all about growing up a "gifted" child and how it's oppressive or whatever. In some ways, I totally sympathize--growing up a smart-ass nerd sucked in many ways. In another way, it reminds me a little bit too much of rich kids whining about how hard it is to be rich or something like that. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Being smart is a good thing.  Mostly, though, I just wonder if everyone who is considering themselves "gifted" is really all that fucking bright.

      I'm not doing a wonderful job keeping this up. Oh well. I suck.  Mark's parents are leaving tomorrow morning, so I think we have to go out to some schmancy dinner tonight. Hopefully the food will be good, because I'd really rather put on pajamas and park it on the couch. I don't know why I am so freaking exhausted right now, but I just have no energy.  I suspect it's because I am on a 100% sugar diet. I have got to stop eating like this if I want to stop feeling like ass.   I am looking forward to the weekend. I am going to have to spend 90% of it doing school work, but at least I won't have to be at LBJ or at work. I like LBJ and I like work, but I am feeling like I'm not spending as much time as I'd like at home lately. I'm such a pathetic homebody.  I'm really scared my grandma is going to die.

      Still depressed and without the energy that I need to get the things I need to do done. And Mark's parents are here, so that's an extra stressor (so far so good with that, but they've only been here since yesterday afternoon). Mark is in the shower right now and I really need to pee, so I'm irritated about that.  I love my dog, though. Love him more all the time. I'm beginning to see why people are so nuts about dogs. It's an interesting personality development.  I really want some Entemann's coffee cake. My food obsessions are so strange. I am about to start my period, though, so I think I'll give myself a break.  I hate to notice this, but I am forever giving myself a break. I need to give myself fewer breaks.

      I'm suddenly depressed. Really, really depressed. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to get out of bed, I can't see any reason to live. It hit me like a truck all of a sudden last night and it hasn't let up. I am at a loss for what to do. I thought the damned antidepressants were supposed to keep this from happening? I've been taking them every morning like clockwork. Why have they suddenly stopped working? Or is it something else entirely? What am I doing wrong?  It sucks that this happened right on the heels of my declaring myself a compulsive shopper and figuring out a plan of action to deal with it. I hate having all of my mental/emotional maladies rear their very ugly heads at once.  And I hate that I have to sit through four hours of TCFC meetings this morning feeling like this. Yuck. I hope I don't have to socialize too much.

      All the federales say We could have had him any day We only let him slip away Out of kindness I suppose -Pancho and Lefty  I am so fucking thrilled. I have discovered that I can download all my mom's old-time country music from Kazaa and listen to it. It's making me homesick in a bittersweet way, but it's nice. It's really nice. I hear this stuff and I'm home again and I know exactly who I am. Nothing to reconcile, nothing to worry about. Just a small town Western girl.  Which is totally untrue, of course, but it's still nice to be in that place for awhile.  Another brilliant idea of the day? Buy Chance stuffed animals to play with from the Goodwill. They are cheap enough that way that I won't freak out when he rips them up. Hopefully Mark won't either. I can't believe how uptight Mark is about the damn dog. We're in the opposite roles I expected. That's probably good.  Oooh, I love this song!

      My main concerns at the moment are financial...  I know how much money I have to last the semester, and I know how much I should be able to spend each month. The past month I've overspent by at least 100%. I rationalize it to myself, saying it is all about start up costs for a new house, a new dog, etc. But really I am just being fiscally irresponsible because it's more fucking fun that way. I have to pull my head out of my ass and start using a reasonable budget or I am really going to be fucked in a few months.  The part-time job will help me to have a bit of "mad" money, and I'm really glad for that, but the bottom line remains that I have got to be frugal or I can't live off part-time work and financial aid. I have to stop buying clothes, spending money on E-bay, etc. I have to relearn my discipline.   Guess it's time to put together a new budget spreadsheet. Icky.

      I'm not getting any better, am I?  See Thirteen. It's amazing. Susan and I saw it last night and I can't stop thinking about it. So many elements of it took me back to being right there. They obviously felt like I felt. Truly, it was unbelievable. Evie was Moriah in some ways, and I could empathize with so much of the pain I saw in Tracey. I felt like I was in middle school/early high school again throughout most of the movie. Even if a lot of the exact experiences didn't parallel mine (and some of them did) the feeling was so right on.  I'm aware that's a very poor review. Sorry. My reaction to it is still very viseral at this point.

      I am back at work and I am not really planning on doing much work today. Hopefully I will be able to put together my Powerpoint presentation for PFM next week and maybe do some more HPV research, hang out on The Phoenix, send silly emails, and generally waste time. I do have a few little projects here I'd like to finish up, but nothing too pressing.  My first waking thought this morning (well, other than "Chance, get your butt out of my face!") was "It will be OK. Tomorrow is Saturday." It's getting that bad. When I look at the list of things I have to do between now and Thanksgiving I just shudder. I have no idea how it's all going to get done. I pretty much informed Mark this morning that he's going to be on housework duty for next month. He took the news well, but we'll see what actually happens.  It wouldn't be so bad if I weren't so fucking tired all the time. I managed to not take a nap when I got home last night, but I was in bed by a bit after 11 and fast asleep in like two minutes. To be fair, though, getting up at 7:15 this morning wasn't much of a problem, so I guess maybe I just need 8 hours of sleep. My tiredness at work yesterday may have been boredom as much as actual fatigue.  Anyway, blah blah blah. Told you I didn't have anything interesting to say.  Woo-hoo! Today is allowance day! And I have an extra-large paycheck to deposit! I'm rich!

      Eek. The amount I have to do for school over the next month is seriously freaking me out. The rundown: For public financial management, I have one problem set, one personal memo presentation, one group budget analysis project and presentation, one final exam. For policy development, I have one op-ed piece, one 15-page policy brief, one presentation of 15-page policy brief. For policy research project I have an in-depth outline of my research proposal and a report to the group on my findings so far. For political economics I have one problem set, one group cost-benefit project, one group cost-benefit presentation and one individual presentation.  Shit.

      Exhale. The big school week is over. Now just two relatively calm days of work, then a weekend. Good stuff. I am definitely in the mode of wanting to play. I'm going to hang out with Susan tonight, which should help considerably. I'm giving myself tonight completely off work. I'll start back up again tomorrow night. Or at least I'll make a new list.  Or maybe I should make a new list tonight. That's not really work.  Budget be damned, I just ordered three tshirts from Northern Sun. One is the old standby "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" (it was on sale for $8), one has a red handprint on black and says "The Death Penalty Makes Killers Of Us All," the final one says "I Read Banned Books" and has a banned books list on it (I've wanted that one forever). Something about living here really makes me want to wear my politics on the outside. I guess that's not a bad thing.   I have to start thinking more about internships. I have to redo my resume. I have to...god, I have so much to do.  The Phoenix is kicking ass, though. 90 active members in less than a week. No complaints from me about that. And people seem to be having actual conversations and everything.  I wonder if anyone aside from Susan and Emily read my blog? If you aren't Susan or Emily and you're reading this, would you let me know? I'm just curious. avengingophelia@yahoo.com

      OK. So I suck. My turn to be passive aggressive.  I'm jealous. That's all there is to it. I'm jealous of S's rambling blog entry about all of her other friends and how she'll be spending the holidays with them (at least I didn't humilate myself by asking what her New Year's plans were). I don't know why I am jealous--I mean, obviously S and T have other friends. It might be that this is the first week since we've been here that we haven't hung out. And that's all me--I've just been too busy--but I guess it makes me insecure. Especially on the heels of S and my first "fight." Though it wasn't really much of a fight, I know I will feel a lot better once I see her and see that's she's not mad at me.   Blah blah. I should erase all that.   In other news, I met with Aditi today to discuss my Reg of Gender paper. She bugs me more every time I have to interact with her. The bottom line is that she's flakey-smart, and there are few things that irritate me faster than flaky smartiness. And she thinks she's fucking brilliant. It all comes back to my hatred of the Reed philosophy department, I think, as she kind of reminds me of the Reed philosophy department. Be that as it may, I'm closer to started on my paper, which is good. I don't really even have time to think about it though--it's a much less immediate priority than the million other school things I have to do. I'm really starting to freak out about all this school crap. The problem, I think, is that I forgot what it's like to never be finished.  My grasp  on reality is tenuous, too. I bought a book today. A novel. Like I am going toh ave time to read a fucking novel anytime before the plane ride home for Christmas? Give me a break.  Given the horror story with Chancey the other morning, we're going to be trying the new pinch collar tonight. THe thing looks like a torture device, but hopefully it will work without hurting him too much. I don't know what else to do. I adore him, but we have to be able to control him.  Fuck. It's the end of the month, almost. Need to pay bills.  Halloween is on Friday and I have no plans. When did I get so old?

      Update your blog, she says. So update my blog I will.  School is just kicking my ass. There is no other way to put it. Suddenly I have rounded the corner from happily overwelmed to freakily overwelmed, and I am not enjoying it. If I could just get a good day's work done I know I'd feel much better, but I am so tired and so distractable...it's not happening. I work for a little while, then I check my email, read The Phoenix, see if anyone needs to be authorized, pet the dog, get some cookies...it's ridicluous.   To be fair, though, I did crank out a PFM memo in fairly short order this morning. I have no idea if it is any good or not (my guess is no), but it is one more thing I can cross off my list. If I have time to go back later and edit it, all the better. If not, so be it. I have other stuff to do.  The Phoenix is rocking and rolling with 75 members and over 700 posts in the past 3 1/2 days. I feel a sense of accomplishment, which is nice. Unfortunately, I am letting it keep me from stuff I really should be focusing on, like my fucking econ midterm. Oh well.  The weather here has turned a little chilly and windy, as if it's really fall. As long as it doesn't last too long, I'm all for it. The trouble is that it feeds right into my urge to curl up in the papasan and read, not do the work I need to get done. Esh. Are you sensing a theme, here?  I did LBJ Day of Service volunteer stuff yesterday. It was pretty much a waste of time. My group was assigned to paint this multimedia room at Johnston HS, which would have been cool, except the guy in charge of the project was in no way ready. He didn't have neccessary supplies, the room wasn't cleaned, blah blah. It was a hassle. I stuck it out for almost three hours, but then I bailed. I got a pretty cool bright green tshirt out of the deal, though. Next time I will follow my gut instincts and go for the library book-sorting project. :)  OK. Back to work. I swear.

      Woo-hoo! We are up to 61 registered members!  This is really thrilling me. The more I talked to Mark about it last night, the happier I was. I feel really great about taking some initiative and actually attempting to build something, rather than just complaining that Ms. was dying.  I feel really bad that Susan hasn't been more involved, though. I really didn't mean to hurt her feelings or be such a freaking steamroller. I have to remember that not everyone feels the need to do things immediatelyjustassoonasithinkofit. I really thought maybe the anti-ds were helpig me to get over that urge, but maybe they aren't.  But Susan and I are OK and I've apologized, so I am going to try to not flog myself over it.  In better news, it's 4:45 on Friday. What a good time to be alive. In 15 minutes I can go home to my dog and my couch and my weekend, busy and school work-filled as it will be.

      A new feminist community for anyone who is interested:  urlLink The Phoenix . Please come on over and join us!   So far I can't believe how well it's going. Only a bit over 24 hours and there are over 50 registered members already and everyone is talking, and behaving civilly. A lot of my favorite Ms. posters are there, and a whole swarm of people I'd like to get to know better are there as well. There are a few more people (well, lots, really) that I am hoping I can convince to come on over as well.  THings are good.

      I'm done with the Warbird, the Ms. boards are becoming a less and less friendly space...I'm thinking maybe it's time to start some boards of my own. Susan says she's interested, so we're going to talk about it tonight (we are going to see Kill Bill). I am trepidatious--what if nobody wants to post on my boards? What if moderating is really hard and puts me in horrible positions all the time? I am not just looking for a place to house my clique, you know? I really want to find a place where women can meet and talk and support and discuss and yeah, even argue, without completely disrespecting each other and treating each other like dogshit. I want a community, the kind that I keep trying to make out of Ms. with damn poor results.  Is it even possible? If I post about this on Ms., how many of the people from there will come over and hang out? Is there a way to make it easy to use/user friendly? I know I can use Ezboards, but I really dislike that format. I'd much rather have something that looks more like Ms. or like the Warbird. Is that expensive? It can't be that expensive, since Rich can apparently afford it. But does it take a ton of technical know-how? I have next to none. I know Susan (and especially Tony) have some...  I don't know why this is so important to me, but it is. I really want this space to exisit, and it has become more and more apparent that's only going to happen if I get off my ass and do something to create it.

      Update: Grits are satisfactory, but we need some salted butter. For some reason unsalted butter+salt doesn't do the same thing salted butter does.  Emily posted a question on the Ms. boards re: "If someone gave you $100 with the express directions to "treat yourself," what would you buy?" I had the hardest time thinking of anything. I could think of lots of ways I'd like to treat Mark, Susan and Tony, etc. My first response was that I'd buy stuff to send care packages to all of my friends afar who are having rough times. At first, I was like, "how cute, look how selfless I am." Then I realized it is much more a case of my treating myself ALL THE FREAKING TIME. Most of the things other people listed are things that I buy for myself regularly, or would, if I wanted them.  No wonder I have a spending problem.

      I walked Chance into an amazing golden sunrise this morning. It almost made being up at 7:30 when I don't have class until 2 worth it. Almost.  I have a stupid group project meeting at the massively inconvenient hour of 9am this morning. Then I'm coming back here and working (read: coming back here and taking a nap) before 2 o'clock class.  So far, having my schedule split into work week and school week seems to take a lot of pressure off.  I am trying to decide if I want to submit a paper/which paper I want to submit to the Women's Studies Colloquium thing. I am tempted to submit an abstract of the paper I am going to write for PD on HPV, since I would like to get more into women's health policy work, and presenting some would be good for the resume. However, I feel weird about signing up to present a paper I haven't written yet. Hrm...The deadline for abstracts is Nov. 14, so the chances of me writing it before then are pretty low, too.   Still, I think that's what I will do.  I am going to try to have grits for breakfast. We'll see how that goes.

      Mmmmm...it's Sunday night and my life is just good. I love my Mark, I love my dog, I love what I'm doing (school and work). I love that I made lentil soup today and it's cheap, it's good and it's nutritious. I love that even though I am tired, I am tired from actually doing school work and chores and playing with the dog. I love that the TV hasn't been on all day and isn't on now.   It's hard to just be content. I don't trust it for very long, and it worries me when things get too quiet and seem too good. But I am content with this. This is what I want. Mark and were sitting on the couch and Chance came up and sat between us (on both of our legs) and we petted him and he just stayed there for several minutes. This is my family, I thought. And it is. I love my family of origin, but this is the family I am creating--the family we are creating. There isn't anything better than that.  OK, I should go get some more reading done before I melt completely into a puddle of gooey romantic nonsense.  Now if I could just figure out what THE FUCK happened to my sex drive...

      Hello, my name is Susan and I suck at updating my blog. It has been nearly a week since my last entry...   Anyway, now that's out of the way. It is an incredibly beautiful Saturday morning here in lovely Austin, Texas. We just took Chance for a walk and as soon as Mark is done with his incredibly gross breakfast (cinnamon raisin toast with peanut butter) we are going to go outside and attempt to give him a bath. Our last attempt at bathing him didn't go too badly, so maybe there's some hope. Then I am going to do inside chores and Mark is going to mow the lawn (it desperately needs it--if I were able to do it, it would have been done a long time ago). Then I am going to see Casa de los Babies with Susan and Tony. I'm excited about that. Then, this afternoon/evening, Mark and I are both going to do school work (I swear!). Sounds like a pretty decent Saturday. Not exactly going to go out partying, but frankly the idea of going out partying nauseates me. I hope I don't regret being this old for my age when I'm 50. I don't think I will, though. I love this life. It's so much less stressful than trying to pretend shit is fun just because it is what I am supposed to doing at this stage.   I slept really well and really long last night (like eleven hours or something). I love sleeping. I love waking up and not having to get out of bed. Few things make me happier.  I think the problem is that I am just inherently lazy. :)  A thread on the Ms. boards has me thinking about which posters I have/have had crushes on. There are a passle of them. It's nice, actually, to be able to get a crush on someone solely for their words, without knowing what they look like. Flea, for example, I've never even seen a picture of. I have no idea what she looks like. I think Emilin and Esch's wedding pictures gave me crushes on both of them before I even knew who Esch was as a poster. I think I still have a crush on them from their wedding pictures, actually. It's a very platonic crush though--more like a "I want to be friends with those beautiful happy women" crush than a "I want to jump their bones!" crush. And the more I know of them, the more that's true--I can't wait to meet them IRL someday.  Less I embarrass myself anymore (I sometimes forget that people do on occaison actually read this thing), I'm going to go and make doggie bath preparations. Have a great Saturday, y'all.

      I had the strangest dream last night. I was walking alone down Henderer Road in Elkton. I was just at the mouth of the road. I can see it so clearly, it's like I was really there. As I was coming up the road, a yellow SUV of some kind came up over that little hill. Then, all of a sudden, a person on a motorbike darted out in front of the SUV. The SUV hit him and he flew into the ditch (and oddly I don't think it was the ditch there, I think it was the deeper ditch, like on Mehl Crick, but I'm not sure. Anyways, he stayed on the bike and came up out of the ditch, only to lose balance and fall again. He didn't come back up, so I ran over to see what had happened. He was lying at the bottom of the ditch, across a big rock, as if maybe his back or neck were injured. Then a car full of people who were coming by on Mehl Crick (right by where our paper box is) stopped and jumped out to come help. One of them was a doctor and he sort of took over, asking the  man where it hurt, etc. I said, "does anyone have a cell phone to call an ambulance?" and the doctor-guy snapped at me, "We already did that!" Then some police came, only they weren't in uniform or anything, but I somehow knew they were authorities. They asked the people from the car what had happened and assuming it was the SUV's fault (the SUV had somehow disappeared at this point). I kept trying to break in and tell them I had seen the whole thing and it was not the SUV's fault, this guy on the bike had darted out in front of them and there was nothing they could do. First I couldn't make the words come out of my mouth (as often happens in dreams, symobolizing impotence supposedly...?), but then I could and they were just ignoring me. They kept talking to the people in the car (both men and women, and there were like 10 of them for some reason) and completely brushing me off when I said I had seen it close up and could give a full description.  Now tell me, what the hell does that mean?

      I'm finding what I wrote yesterday to be quite embarrassing and am tempted to edit it, but I'm not going to. Why should it be embarrassing?  Had a very nice walk with Chancey this morning. It's getting chilly enough for a (light) sweatshirt here in the mornings, if you go out before 9. It's nice.   I have to go to work in a few minutes. I have a pill lodged somehow in my estophagus or something and it is sending burning bile up into my mouth. It is not pleasing me.

      Why is it that no matter what time I get here on Wednesday, there's never any place to fucking park? I always have to park illegally in the library lot during my first class. Makes me crazy.  Susan and I went to see Ani last night. She was good. I've seen her better, but she was good. Very mellow, just her and her guitar. I think I liked her best with just Andy, or maybe with Andy and Sara Lee. I certainly like her better by herself than with the full horn section and all that crap, but she loses a bit by not having a rthymn section.  Someday, I will learn to spell rythme. Rythmn. Was that right?   Anyway, I think Susan enjoyed the show and I was really  happy she came. I had been worried for days that she wouldn't like it, and with the tickets being so spendy, etc., I was going to feel terrible if she didn't. She did though, so all is well.  I honestly don't understand how anybody could not like Ani, but I'm biased.  I really don't want to be at school today. Wednesday is always like this.  Next semester's class schedule is up, so I'm trying to figure out what to take. There are several interesting sounding seminars. Maybe I should email some professors...I have one extra space in my schedule, so I can take something fun, rather than a core course (because I didn't take AQA last semester). I'll pay for it by having to take PE II and AQA II next year, but whatever. Spread that nasty shit out. :)  I'd like to take something in the women's studies department. I keep thinking about joint degrees...but then I realize that I have already bitten off more than I could possibly chew and really I should just leave well enough alone.  I have a lot to do, school-wise. I should probably be stressed about it, but I'm really not. I am too freaking tired to be stressed right now. I have no idea why, but I'm exhausted.   I think changing my work week so that school and work are seperate (school Mon-Wed, work Thurs-Fri, weekend Sat-Sun) will help. I hope so...

      There is lots floating around in my little head this morning. Walking Chance was great--beautiful weather, he was well-behaved, and my mind just wandered. I had no idea having a dog would offer me this particular chance for peace and reflection in the mornings. It's so nice. I'm sure that once it gets into winter and it's dark and shit when I need to walk him I'll be less all about it, but for now it's lovely.  Anyway, I realized that I am worried about what happens when Susan and Tony finally go get their little girl. I'm so excited for them, and I think they will make exceptional parents, but you hear all those stories about how it's tough for people with kids to be friends with people without kids...I'm afraid of losing them as friend. I think most of their other friends (the ones closer to their own age) probably have kids, too, so they will have more in common with them than with us...blah blah blah. I don't know why I am even fretting about it--it will either work out or it won't. But I just enjoy hanging out with them so much, I don't want that to all go away when the baby gets here.  My selfishness knows no bounds.  What else have I been thinking about? I had so much to write and it sort of flew out of my head as soon as I got back in the door. Stupido...  Oh, yeah, thinking about internships for the summer. I'd really like to stay here, it would be infinitely easier, Mark and I wouldn't have to do the LDR thing, I wouldn't have to pay rent in two places, etc. However, the more I look the more I see better opportunities elsewhere (including and right now especially in Portland). It wouldn't be THAT tough to go back for the summer, would it? On one hand my relationship (my family, I guess, when I think about Mark+Chance) is my top priority. On the other hand, I don't want to sell myself short career-wise (or financially) by taking something mediocre here when I could do something excellent elsewhere. This is going to require a lot of thought.   Off to class in a bit, then back here for the afternoon, then class tonight. My weekends have been so relaxed lately that the week sort of takes the breathe out of me when it rolls around. Mark and I even found time to watch a DVD last night ("Philadelphia"). With the Ani show on Tuesday night, this week is going to be especially busy. I'll survive, I know, especially since I miraculously finished all of my reading (well, all of it that I'm going to do) over the weekend so I don't have that pressure. Still, I find myself in "gearing up" mode this morning, as if I am headed into battle and not just a week like any other.  I am a little bit concerned at the amount of energy my everyday life seems to be taking out of me recently. It reminds me uncomfortable of The Time Before Antidepressants. :(

      Another very mellow day. Read my econ, did some grocery shopping, made enchiladas to eat for lunch this week. All in all, I'm doing quite well with crossing things off my list and not spending any money (well, besides the groceries, but that doesn't really count--that was joint account money and those are sort of necessary). It's a bit after 4 now though, and I am bored and restless. I have more work to do, but I've been so well-disciplined for the last few days, I am losing my drive. Maybe I'll watch one of Tony and Susan's movies or something.   Mark is beginning preparations for dinner. Mustard-crusted pork loin and roasted baby red potatoes with mixed greens, I'm told. My stomach is upset and has been all day, so hopefully by the time dinner rolls around I'll be up for eating it. I think I fucked up the enchiladas by making them with sharp cheddar cheese rather than a mild cheddar/pepper jack mix. Stupid store didn't have any pepper jack. Guess I should have just gotten regular jack. Oh well--they'll be edible anyway, I'm sure.  I should really call a bunch of people, but I don't really feel like talking on the phone. I should also get some work done on that damn scholarship application essay, but my dreams and how I plan to accomplish them (in 500 words or less) is pretty much the very last thing I want to write about right now.  So maybe I'll go watch TV. I intervened in Mark's TV watching this morning, though, so I will feel like a total hypocrite if I turn it on myself (even though I shouldn't, as I barely ever watch it anymore).  Blah. I love the laziness of Sundays...why am I jumping out of my skin?

      Today continued my trend of getting shit done, for which I am grateful. I read all of the PD chapters, two of the three PRP articles, did some PRP writing, watched the first 1/2 of the very depressing UT-OU football game, took TWO naps, took a bath and shaved all of the parts that needed shaving AND did eight loads of laundry (including sheets and blankets). I'm very proud of myself. I have more to do tomorrow, of course (like always), but I think I did a very reasonable amount today. Oh, and Mark and I went out to dinner at the Hyde Park Cafe.   Mark has pretty much been watching TV and otherwise lazing about all day, even though he keeps telling me he really really really needs to work on his NSF application. I'm not sure what his deal is. Far be it from me to nag him, though. He'll figure it out. I just wish he would watch less TV, because having the TV on is increasingly annoying to me. Wow, that sounded incredibly snobby. With as much as we pay for cable, I should be glad someone is watching it.   It's been raining all day and is supposed to rain for the next couple of days. It's so weird how it can be both very warm and rainy here, even in the middle of October. Strange stuff. I wish the rain would stop, though, because I am tired of Chance having muddy paws and us having muddy feet every time we go outside. The floors, which I spent so much time cleaning yesterday, are already covered in dirt and hair again, as are our bedsheets and blanket, which I washed just this afternoon. You can't win, I guess. It's part of having a dog. Again, I wish Mark were just a wee bit more helpful with this stuff (I don't think he reads this, so I am going to go ahead and leave that. If he does read it, well, maybe he'll get the clue!). Either I think he does less than he does or he thinks he does more than he does, but either way it's becoming more of an issue, at least in my mind. And the last fucking thing in the world I want to fight about it housework.  Interestingly, Mark and I have fought WAY less since we got here than we did before. I don't know why, exactly. It's good, though. I feel more and more like he's someone I could spend the rest of my life with.  If he'd learn to do the damn dishes and pick up his clothes, that is. :)  Susan and I are going to see Ani at an outdoor venue on Tuesday, so as long as the rain stops by then, I'll be satisfied. It looks like it is supposed to (but you never know). The tickets were expensive and I really want Susan to enjoy the show, so I really hope it stops. I also hope Ani is "on." She usually is, and when she is, it's something to see, but she was a bit off when we saw her last fall.  OK. Enough babbling. Susan, if you are reading this, UPDATE YOUR DAMN BLOG!! :)

      Sleepy-deepy. Tony and Susan came over tonight, we all ate pizza and watched Baz's Romeo and Juliet. Susan hadn't seen it before. It was a good time. Susan and Tony left us some other movies to watch. They did that last time they came over as well. Plus we have three more from Netflix. We are awash in movies. I really really wish I could find some time to watch some of them.   I need to consult my list, but I feel like I accomplished a good amount today. Tomorrow's agenda includes the football game, reading, doing laundry, reading, reading and reading. Trying to get something out for an essay for this scholarship app. and some writing for my PRP would be good, too.  And maybe some preliminary research on internships. I met with the internship coordinator today, though, and it sounds like I am in good shape. I need to rework my resume, though, so I will have it on hand if something comes up. Should probably try to get to that this weekend as well. We'll see.  I have an econ midterm in less than two weeks. I definitely need to learn some damn econ.  For now, though, I am quite tired. I think it's time for bed.

      I am Grace, accompishment-machine!  First I actually used my sick day yesterday and got almost all of my econ problem set done. Yay me. Then today I went to work, then went and met with the internship woman at LBJ, then came home and cleaned practically the whole house. That cuts some significant time off my weekend list. Yay me again!  I'm tired now though, and I think I'm gonna watch TV.

      I have decided to use my patented, one-of-a-kind stress-busting method today.  Yep, that's right, I called in sick. No work. Spending all day at home getting things done, then going to that event tonight un-exhausted. Probably not the most mature thing to do, but fuck it, it's a mental health day.  And I do kind of feel like ass, actually. Sore throat, sinus headache, itchy eyes...must be allergies.

      I am stressed. I am not enjoying it. I have that water-rising-above-my-head-too-much-to-do-not-enough-time feeling. SO perhaps a to-do list will help. Perhaps it is just a waste of time, but I'm done for the night either way, and I'd like to be able to sleep, so here goes: Annoyingly long list of things I need to do in the near future: 1. Work all day Thursday 2. Go to POWER domestic violence event Thursday night 3. Work Friday 10-2 4. Meet with LBJ internship coordinator Friday at 2:30 5. Read 4 chapters and an essay for policy development, then check out a webpage, then email my group with my thoughts. Do this by Friday. 6. Draft a memo topic for public financial management by Monday. 7. Do my economics problem set, at which I have not yet glanced, by Wednesday. 8. Read three articles for Regulation of Gender, email Aditi at least once, and do at least three free-writes, by Tuesday. 9. Read Lessons from the Intersexed, or at least get a good start on it, this week. 10. Do my economics reading for Wednesday (two chapters). 11. Do my PFM reading for Monday, then for Wednesday. 12. Wash the filthy floors in my house. 13. Do laundry. 14. Write a 500 word essay about my dreams and how I plan to achieve them in order to apply for some scholarship I don't remember the name of. Due 10/21. 15. Get together some care packages for some folks who I know could use them. Get these in the mail by Monday. 16. Wash the dog. He is filthy. 17. Make something to take for lunch next week. 18. Finish reorganizing/cleaning out the office. 19. Make an appointment at Planned Parenthood to get my cervix scraped and see if I still have pre-cancerous growths there. 20. To to Pier One and scout out things for my relaxation kits.  I could go on, but I won't. It isn't helping, and I sound so damn whiny. The upshot is that I have lots to do, mostly stuff I don't want to do, and I am afraid the stuff I really think is important, some of which I didn't even list, now that I look at it, will fall by the wayside.  I have to get used to never being finished. That is what school is all about. There's always some project, some reading, some writing, something you should be doing. It took me two years to get used to that in undergrad. I had no idea I would forget so quickly.  I want to hang out with Susan this weekend. I want to watch the Red River Shoot-out (it's the game of the year!). I want to go to the one-night-only mother and daughter themed play at the Blanton. I want to go see the Warhol exhibit before it goes away. I want to take a bath and read the new Bitch that came in the mail today.  But something has to give.

      Ug ug ug. Today is just shitty all around. I can't believe how much the upsetting news of all of my friends is upsetting me. I can't tell if it's empathetic or self-centered to say that, either, which just makes me feel vaguely shitty about myself.   And I got not enough sleep last night, so I am crabby and tired. For the first time, I'm not looking forward to Regulation of Gender this afternoon.  I'm bailing on the doggie training class on Thursday in order to volunteer at a Stop Domestic Violence event. I have on idea if the event (which includes a performance by Lisa Loeb, a short film and a speaker) will be any good at all, but I told myself I was going to get more involved in actual feminist activities here, and by God I am.  For all that's worth.

      Why does everyone around me seem to be going through such a terrible time? Emily's mother is dying. Frog's relationship is ending. Susan and Tony are excited about going to China to pick up their little girl, but Tony still doesn't have a job. My mother lives in agonizing pain for no damn reason. Why can't only good things happen to the good people that I know? Aren't there enough bad people in the world to take up all the bad shit happening? And what's next? Is it me? Am I horrible for worrying that I'll be next, rather than focusing all of my attention on the people around me who I so very much want to  support?  This fucking sucks.

      Deep breath.  I talked to Emily on the phone a bit ago. It sounds like her mom is very sick. Dying, probably. And there is nothing I can say about that that will make it any better. I wish I could, but I can't. Still, I thought I'd call and at least let her know I am thinking about her and I am here if she wants or needs to talk. Now that I'm off the phone, of course, I can think of a few things I wish I had said. Something about how it feels to watch someone you love die of cancer, and I know that, because I have seen it a couple of times now. Something about how even though I've seen it, I can't imagine it happening to my mother. Something about how my mom is the single most important person who will ever be in my life and I can't even fucking comprehend anything like this happening to her.  But perhaps it is better that I did not say any of those things. Instead, I asked questions about the prognosis, about the trajectory of events. I think I did that because sometimes talking about things makes it easier--going over the details is something you can sort of control, you can speak about it calm, measured terms. It's easier than how you feel, it's easier than what you are afraid of.   I don't know, though. Maybe I shouldn't have called at all. I really have no idea. I know there is no way I can help.  Crying, now, for Emily and her mom. And for Papa Gene, who I still miss, though I wasn't old enough to understand I was saying goodbye to him when I was. And for Grandpa Davie, to whom I was old enough to say goodbye, and that doesn't make me miss him any less.  I am so glad that Emily has her God. I don't know how helpful He(he? she?) is in all this, but I think this kind of situation is one of the best arguments for keeping the faith.  I wish I had some faith I could keep with her. I wish I could pray so I could pray for her. But I can't, so I guess I'll just keep writing.

      Yay. Monday morning. :)  I actually kind of like Mondays. The big chunk of time to myself in between my morning class and my evening class is nice. And it's especially nice this week, because I actually have almost all of my reading for the week (everything except for economics) done, so I don't have to feel guilty about napping instead of reading during those precious afternoon hours.  There was a big beautiful storm here last night. Thunder and lightening and the whole 9 yards. It has faded into drizzly rain today, which isn't so cool, but it's worth it. I am grateful that Chance isn't afraid of storms. He doesn't seem to even notice them, actually. When I get home and the whole house smells like wet dog, though, I'll probably be less pro-rain.  Still, the weather here is certainly nothing to complain about. I hear there are parts of the country where you have to wear a coat! :)

      Goodness but I'm muddled.  So the LBJ list serve is 1% interesting or useful information, 50% people wanting to sell or buy football tickets, 49% announcements about LBJ social events I couldn't care less about. On Friday there was something called the "Booze Cruise," which I think was about like it sounds--bunch of people getting smashed out on a boat. Today, someone posted some pictures from the event. I flipped through them and saw some of the insipid people from my classes were there, as well as a few of the less insipid people. I would rather poke myself in the eye with sharp sticks than attend one of these parties.  Why, then, do I feel all left out and like I'm not one of the cool crowd (uh, cuz you're not, dumbass)? I was invited. I could have gone. I didn't want to. It wouldn't have been fun. It would have been stupid. I'm completely uninterested in having an LBJ-centered social life. I've had a really good relaxing weekend at home. So where does the jealousy come from? I think it's sad and pathetic that these people are still reliving their undergraduate experiences, I want no part of it.  Why do I get so disgusted with  myself for being antisocial? I have friends, both the ones that are scattered to the four winds and the ones here (Susan and Tony). I don't WANT these social climbing nitwit wanna-be politicians as friends.  But I guess I still want them to want me...:(

      All day to myself...all day to myself...  I couldn't be more excited. It's beautiful outside, the house is quiet, Chance is being mellow (so far--I need to take him for a walk before I get too into anything, though). And Mark just left a bit ago and will likely be gone until late afternoon. Much needed alone time. Yay!  I actually have on idea what I am going to do with the time. I have a pretty much endless amount of school work to do, so I'll have to get going on some of that, but I want to do other stuff, too. Make the mixed CDs I want to make for Ms. folks, listen to my own music at my own volume...  I'm tempted to make some phone calls I am terribly remiss in making, but that sort of defeats the point of having the day to myself, so I think I'll wait on that. I got a message from Nana the other night that was very much along the lines of "are you still alive?" so I really should call her. Maybe tonight.  First thing's first: Chancey is obviously itching for a walk. Please let him be mellow....

      I am bailing on the lab picnic tomorrow and spending the day home by myself. I'm quite excited. I feel bad, but not that bad. If the situation were reversed, Mark would probably go with me, but there are things I do for him he won't do for me, too.   We rearranged the office a bit today and added a couple of new cheapo Target bookshelves. I'm much happier with it now. Takes care of the problem with piles of my school shit on the floor, at least for the moment. Hopefully I will be able to muster the energy to do some more cleaning tomorrow. Maybe not, though. It is, after all, my day.   Mark is watching Eddie Izzard on HBO Comedy. He is damn funny.

      I had the worst dreams last night. All of these related vignettes about Simon and how bad living with him and dating him and attempting to trust and/or love him was. Mostly stuff very inspired by real life. But real life years ago! What's going on with it popping back into my head now? Strange stuff. I am glad to be awake now.  I have some errands to get done (I get to buy stuff with joint account money, yay!) before the game starts at 2. It's 11 and I haven't even showered yet. Have I mentioned how irrationally much I love weekends?  Tomorrow I have to go to some lab picnic thing with Mark in some state park. I'm less than thrilled. For some reason I really don't want to go. Mostly I don't mind that kind of stuff, but I'm in such a big "I want to be alone" phase, I would so much rather he just go and I have several hours at home by myself. Not going to happen, though, as it would cause some pretty chilly weather in this household if I told him I won't go.  Last night we went to see Lost in Translation with Susan and Tony. I think I liked it more than anyone else in the group did. There were certain things about it that irritated the fuck out of me (like the girl always being in her underwear and the preponderance of karioke), but the general tone of it really impressed me. I related to it, to the loneliness and the confusion, and that always sells me on a film.  Hanging out with Susan and Tony so much is so great. I got all worried on the drive back home last night that we are availing ourselves of their company too much and they are getting sick of us and are just too polite to say anything. I really hope that's not the case. I honestly think my wanting to hang out with them so much has very little to do with not having any other friends here--I didn't really have any friends left in Portland by the time we left, and I was pretty content to just hang out by myself and with Mark. I just really LIKE doing things with Susan and Tony. I really hope they feel the same way about us as we do about them, since they aren't in our situation and presumably could be choosing to do other things with their other friends.  Inferiority complex much? Sheesh.  One thing Mark and I were talking about last night that is really peripheral to why we like Susan and Tony so much but is a good side benefit is the age difference. They are 10 years older than we are, but it feels totally normal to hang out with them. Weird as it sounds, they make me feel SO much better about aging. Looking at them I feel like it's totally possible to get older and more mature and consider stuff like buying a house, getting married, having a baby, etc. and still not lose yourself the way you always have been. That is such a great thing.   I'm rambling on and on and I've got to go take a shower and get my shit done if I want to be back in time for kickoff. Plus Chance is making a very strange noise...

      Big excitement this evening. Just as Mark and Chance and I were driving up the street on the way back from doggie class and there was a big accident right at the intersection practically in front of our house. Two completely smashed cars, and the kid who ran the stop sign and caused it got out of his car and ran. Mark just came in and told me that he left his license in the car, though, stupid fuck. It's going to suck to be him in awhile.  Who the hell hits someone and then runs away without even seeing if they are OK?

      So much talk about babies is making me wonder if I want to have one. My gut instinct is no. Once in awhile I get that, "awww, a baby, I want a baby!" thing, but not very often. Not as often as I probably should. It will come with time though, I expect.   Strangely, though, I've been thinking about getting married. A lot. Thinking about how it maybe sounds like not that bad an idea. This frightens me immensely. I know Mark doesn't want to get married, and I would be hardpressed to put into words why I think it's anything less than a terrible idea. Still, the thought keeps coming back to me.  I  have even had a couple of dreams about it lately.  Why am I doing no work today?

      I need new running shoes. I want Asics or New Balance. I need a size 12. I want them to be reasonable looking, light, and cost less than $40. Is that doable?  I think I just spent an hour dyeing my hair the exact same color. Again. For some reason it didn't cover up the freaky blonde streaks.

      Things are still quite excellent. It's just been a lovely weekend all around. Today we slept in late (even though I had to nap on the couch with Chance to keep him from whining) and in a bit we're going to take Chance to the park. Then back here to do some work this afternoon and maybe a movie (but probably just home and TV) this evening.  We watched Scotland, PA on DVD last night. It was way way better than I expected it to be. True, I'm a sucker for modernized retellings of Shakespeare, but I think they did a really good job with Macbeth. It was close enough to the original but still far enough away. And it was funny, too. I really liked it.  Mark wants to use the computer...

      I am so thankful.  This has been an amazing Thanksgiving. Mark and I did a great job with the food and we've just had a wonderful day. I'm really really happy we decided to stay home and just have it be us. We even gave Chancey a big plate of food, which he demolished in 30 seconds or so. It was hysterical. And Mark and I both conked out for like two hours after dinner. We're going to be eating leftovers for a month.  In a more general way, though, I am very thankful for my life. Things are going well. In general, I am happy and healthy and stable and secure. Mark and I are doing wonderfully and we feel permanent to me. I'm worried about my mom's back, but there is really nothing I can do about that from here, so I should try not to worry about it more than I have to. Hopefully she can have the surgery while I am in Oregon over Christmas. I want to be able to help her...  My presentations this week have stressed me out, but things are going very well. I am really happy with both of my groups. Group work experiences have been so up-and-down (mostly down) for me in the past, group work was something I was really worried about at LBJ, and I these experiences have made me feel much better about it. This is good.  I'm attempting to get my internship requirement for the summer waived. I'll try to do an internship anyway, but if I do it for credit, as is required, I have to pay out-of-state tuition on it, which amounts to about $2,000. That's a huge fucking waste. So hopefully they will waive me on the basis of the work I am doing at Texans Care now. I doubt they will, but it's worth a try. That will mean I have to take one more class next year, but that's really no big deal, especially since it won't change my tuition costs (and I get a waiver on the out-of-state portion for the academic year). If I get the waiver it will also allow me to be more creative in what I decide to do for the summer. So I'm going to finish the waiver app this weekend and hope for the best.  It's amazing how cold it feels in here when it's 53 degrees outside. My feet are like icecubes.  Mark is doing better this week with work/school stuff too, which is really nice. I worry that he'll resent me if he doesn't like it here. I know he likes Austin, but the school thing is so mixed. I have high hopes for Hitoshi's lab, though. Hitoshi came over the night for a few minutes. He's really funny. Japanese James Cagney is exactly the right way to describe him.  I haven't been writing in my blog as much lately because I have been busy, but there has been another reason as well. I have blog-envy. I read Flea's blog and it's so damn good--interesting, funny, well-written...makes me wonder why I bother with it when all I do is blab on and on about my not-very-interesting life. Then I feel really stupid for my envy, because honestly, I don't want a kid that puts shitty underwear in my coffee pot*. And if I had one, I don't think I'd find the energy to write about it like Flea does. I really admire her.  Anyways...blabber blabber blabber. Mark is on the phone with his parents. Chance is curled up on the floor. All is good.  But I need to go put some socks on.  * Actually, I just don't want a kid. The shitty underwear and the coffee pot are side issues. And I don't even have a coffee pot.

      It's possible that we may have a new addition to our happy household.  Last night when we were walking Chance (it was 11:30 or so), we got by the gated condo community where I always encourage him to pee, and a cat started following us. We tried to keep Chancey's attention and figured it would go away after awhile. We were wrong. It followed us (at very close range) the entire way home. Then, when we got home, it ran up to the porch and attempted to go inside with us. So Mark took Chancey inside and I brought the kitty some milk. It's a smallish long-haired cat (really funny looking, actually, like with a Siamese body and tail and a calico face) and it's pretty thin, no collar, full claws. It sat on my lap and purred and I petted it. I have no idea whether or not it's a stray, but it's obviously a pretty damn spunky cat if it's willing to even get close to us with monster dog around. Mark and I talk about it and realize there is no way we can bring it in--Chance would kill it, even if he didn't mean to. So I figure if it's still around in the morning, we can start feeding it outside and see what happens. With the claws and everything it should be OK with being an outside cat.  In the morning it seemed to be gone, so I figured it had moved on.  Wrong.  Mark and Chance were just outside, and the cat showed back up. And took a stand against Chancey. Chance barked and growled and the cat stood his/her ground and gave him a swipe across the nose that drew blood.  So...we'll see. S/he seems to like it here. Maybe we can work something out.

      Shit.  I think I might be getting sick. I don't necessarily feel sick yet, but I feel distinctly like ass this morning, even though I got plenty of sleep. My throat kind of hurts and I feel kind of achey and I really just want to go back to bed.  That can't be good.  Oh well. Just have to get through today and then I can renegotiate. If worst comes to worst, I will have to skip work this week. I have to be well enough to go to class next week, since I have presentations in every class.  One step at a time.

      What a great morning. Slept late (after 10!) and then walked Chance. The weather is amazing--sunny, 70s and windy. Chance actually behaved on our walk, too. All in all, a very good way to start the day.   Now I have to go to campus for two group meetings and a class, but I'm sure it will be fine. Also, I finished the problem set in record time yesterday, which makes me feel real cool.  Listen to  urlLink Mary Prankster . For real. She's amazing. I'm so excited to have new music. Now I just have to get paid so I can actually buy her CDs instead of downloading her.  I wish I could think of more political and social commentary to put on here, but honestly it's just turning out to be a space where I vent about my life. There is nothing really wrong with that, I suppose, but I don't see why anyone would want to read it.

      ...A gentle, non-demanding reminder: Susan, you have not written in your blog since last Sunday. End of message...  THe problem with Do Whatever I Want Day is it is directly followed by "Do All The Stuff I Should Have Done Yesterday Day." Damn I wish Mark would get better so I'd have some help with all of this shit.  My current plan is to skip PFM (it's a guest speaker, something about taxes--I feel guilty for not going, but this is the first time I have skipped without a legitimate reason and I just can't go to campus and come back three times today). I have a meeting with my PE group at 2, but I can do housework and get things back into shape until then. Then hopefully I can work on my PFM problem set, which sneaked up on me and is due Wednesday.  Fascinating, I know. I don't know why I feel the need to post the intricacies of my daily schedule on my blog. Mmm...narcissism.  I am tired of Mark being sick. It's horribly selfish, I know, but I was so looking forward to his return because then I would have some HELP, and instead all I got was more work. But at least I am not feeling sick myself. I can handle it.

      Do Whatever I Want Day has been a raging success. It's now 11:30, I'm thinking about bed, and I haven't done a single thing I didn't want to do all day. No chores, no homework, nothing. I am definitely going to have to schedule days like this in a couple more times before the end of the semester if things get too tense. This has worked like a charm--I feel ready to go on and work hard now.   Which is good, since shit is about to start up again tomorrow morning.  Mark is watching "The Rules of Attraction" in the living room. I am glad I can't see it, because just hearing it is bad enough. Stupid shit. Why are most movies so stupid?  I really want some movies that I want to see to come to a theater near me. I love going to the movies. I went to this  urlLink bizarre film  with Susan and Tony tonight. It was really well-done, even though the movie was ass-stupid. I do not understand Mexican wrestling. The masks sort of freak me out, though. They remind me of nasty bondage gear or something.

      Do Whatever I Want Day delimmma: It is 9:15. I have been doing whatever I want all day, and it's been quite fufilling. Now I'm home, Mark is still really sick, and there are several chores that need to be done. Should I do them now, or leave them until tomorrow? I am thinking leave them until tomorrow. I'll walk the dog, but other than that, they can all wait. It's good for me to learn to leave things go a bit, and the whole idea of DWIWD would sort of be moot if I ruined it with chores now. It will all still be there (unfortunately) tomorrow.  So there.

      Today is my day completely off, or so I have ordained. My schedule will be as follows: sleep late (which I did) take Chance for a walk (I already did that, too, we just got back) take a shower (that's up  next) curl up in the papasan and watch a depressing documentary about Poland  read the Sunday times, but only the parts that interest me and not the parts that I think I should read go to Target and the Goodwill and spend money, but not too much money hang out with Susan/go to a matinee come home and lie around watching TV all evening take a long hot bath go to bed  Sounds good, huh? I have a sneaking suspicion in the back of my mind that I'll be tempted to do some much-needed housework or proof my paper or something, but that can all wait until tomorrow. Today is my day. I've earned it.

      Finally, some progress on my paper. I'm halfway through page 7 and things are moving along much more smoothly. Thank God.   Getting into all this HPV stuff pisses me off to no end. I wrote an impassioned thing on The Phoenix about my HPV experiences the other day, and it drew very few responses. It doesn't seem to be much of a resonating feminist issue. Makes me wonder if it's really all that important, or if I just think it's important because it has affected me personally?  I do think it's important, though. Something about millions of women trooping dutifully in every year to have Pap smears when they have no fucking clue what they are being tested for rubs me the wrong way. It seems unethical. Don't people have the right to know what the fuck they are being tested for? Or do only men have that right?  The reasons for not making the connection more explicit make some sense, but they all come down to stigma against female sexuality. Unlike breast cancer or endometrial cancer or whatever else, cervical cancer isn't a "blameless" disease. You got it from sex. No, you didn't necessarily h ave to have multiple partners or even have gone unprotected, but the bottom line is that saying a woman has cervical cancer is saying she has fucked, and nobody wants to admit that women fuck. It is supposed to be burnt or frozen off quietly and not mentioned, rather than talked about, because while cancer makes you a martyr, sexually transmitted infections make you a whore.  So what happens when the two collide? Lots of lying and looking the other way, apparently.  I'm not sure the paper is going to be any good, policy-wise. At least not in this incarnation. Hopefully I can have it whipped into shape for either or both of the conferences, though, if either of them accept me.   I'm increasingly interested in lesbian health issues. Again, the whole idea of stigma and misinformation. Hopefully I can get further into that in the future.  A lot of people think that public education campaigns are "soft" policy. What do you think?

      Mark is so sick. It is distracting me from everything. I am really worried about him. I hate it when people who are not me are sick, because I can't get inside them and gauge how sick they really are and how much taking care of they need. I worry I'll underestimate and he'll get worse. Maybe I should have forced him to go to the doctor today. Anytime anyone has a fever, I get scared.  But the fever is gone this afternoon, so at least the cold medicine seems to be doing its thing. Perhaps I worry too much and he will be fine.  My shoulder thing is getting worse. Lifting my arm up is excrutiating and my hand is tingly. I should go have it looked at, but frankly there is no way to find the time right now.   This is probably going to be a pretty stressful weekend. My three priorities: 1. Take care of Mark. 2. Don't get sick myself. 3. Write my paper.  If I can manage those three things, I will be very happy indeed.

      I'm in a bit of a storytelling mood...  It was the summer of 2001. I had just graduated from Reed. I had just blessedly ended my ill-fated relationship with Simon. I was madly in love with Mark, I knew it, he knew it, but there were several rather large obstacles (like 1500 miles and a long-term girlfriend) standing in the way of realizing that love. Mark and I were best friends/worst enemies, though, and spent hours a day on the phone. My life had fallen down around me, I couldn't find a job, I had no idea who to define myself as if not a student. I was miserable. I lived with Jenny and Natalie and I treated them terribly. The whole situation was bad. I drank more than I should have,  I drove when I drank (something I had never done before and have never done since),I engaged in extremly self-destructive behavior, I cut for the first time, I smoked like a chimney...I could go on and on.  At my graduation party, my grandmother very kindly offered me a part-time job teaching basic composition at her school. Teaching two nights a week for eight weeks for $800 didn't sound bad to me, and I certainly had nothing else to do. So I took it. The minute I walked in I knew it was a mistake--my "students" were people going to a washed-up "business" school to get computer credentials. They were all older than me, from a few years to a few decades. They were hard. They didn't want to be there, and, unlike me, they weren't getting paid.  And their writing skills were fucking abysmal.  I fucked up from minute one. I treated them like comrades, I didn't assert any authority. I cursed and told them how stupid and worthless I thought their school was (and it is, but that's besides the point). I taught them nothing (and then graded hard, which is really awful). We left our three hour class 1.5 hours in nearly every time.  And then William started hitting on me. He circled me from the second class. He was tall, Black, sat in the back row, did absolutely nothing but crack jokes during class. Dead fucking sexy. The first time he stayed after class (to "get extra help"_ he showed me the scar where he'd been shot and some of his tattoos. It was all fucking over.  So I started sleeping with one of my students. The sex was good, his stories were great. He'd been a crack dealer back east and moved out west with his brother to get computer skills and "start over." He was clean but drank like a fucking fish. He grew up in an actual ghetto, he'd been stabbed and shot, he had seven tattoos. I was fascinated.  Part of it was about getting Mark to be jealous, which I think worked, to some extent. Part of it was novelty. Part of it was that I was so goddamn sick of being me that I would latch on to anyone who would make me someone else.  So I tried to be someone else. I started listening to Tupac. I wore Nikes with miniskirts and started mimicking some of his speech patterns. I drank more than ever before and didn't think twice about driving, or about riding with William when he'd been drinking. I had a lot of sex and watched a lot of TV. I immersed everything real about me.  And I kept teaching the damn class very very poorly. The rest of the class knew something was up between him and I, but they were chill about it. William and I had agreed to keep it under our hats until the end of the term, but it was pretty obvious.  Then he got kicked out of school, for reasons I am still unclear about, but had nothing to do with me. We continued to "date" for a few more weeks. The novelty wore off, we had a few stupid arguments, we broke up. I saw him once after we broke up (a week or two after, well before Mark moved back to Portland). We got drunk and then went to see "Blow" at the Laurelhurst and had sex in the back row.  Then I went home and realized just how low I'd sunk.   As far as strings of compounding mistakes go, I've made my fair share, but that summer has got to top the list. Embarrassingly, the shit with William wasn't even the most morally reprehensible shit I did. I betrayed my grandmother's trust, I acted in the least professional way possible...everything I did was wrong.  Why I am thinking about that tonight I have no idea, but there it is. It's not a very good story. Mark thinks it is funny that I once-upon-a-time dated a crack dealer, but I don't. I lost myself completely for a while there, everything I believe and stand for. It's one of the scariest things I can ever remember happening, and it was completey my fault.  No moral. I fucked up, I more or less got away with it. I won't do it again.

      Adam was in town last night, so we hung out for a few hours. It was good to see him--he seems good. Seeing him always makes me question my decisions, I guess because he proves it's possible to do something I wouldn't think it would be possible to do. Makes me feel like a big-ass sellout, especially when my alarm goes off because I have to go to work in the morning.  On the other hand, though, I would never be able to deal with that kind of instability. I worry too much.  Besidse that, his way with words makes me look like fucking W. Music talentlessness aside, I don't think I could write songs that good, even if I did devote my time to it.  I would like to start writing something more substantive in my blog. I have to start thinking more substantive thoughts, first.

      There are little snails all over the sidewalk when I walk Chancey. This happens every time it rains here--very odd. I step on them accidentally and then feel terrible.  Chance is lying on the floor right next to my chair looking up and me like he wants something. I think it is my breakfast. Too bad, Chance! He made a huge mess all over the floor with his dirty paws after he came in from outside, and I did only a marginal job of cleaning it up, but too bad, I'm busy.  I hate it that I had to get up before 8 when I don't have class until 10:30. I wonder what time Adam is going to show up tonight? I need to make that bed in there if he's going to sleep in it...I kind of hope he doesn't stay here, as it will just trip Chance out even more...  Ah, stream of conciousness blogging. How boring can I possibly get?  Anyways...

      So I just put my roses in fresh water and clipped them. They are doing pretty well, considering they are on their fifth day. I think taking care of them makes all the difference.  It is amazing to me the difference having fresh flowers in the house makes to my psyche. I know it's not PC to buy cut flowers and I am supporting the use of all sorts of nasty chemicals and all that, but I can't help it. They make me feel better, and when I feel like I have been, I'll do whatever makes it better.  Could be heroin, right?

      Tonight is better. I dragged myself through the whole day and I feel good about that. Aditi gave me a book on how to conquer writer's block, so I am going to go through that tonight and see if I find any gems that will help me on the paper. I've already accepted that this thing due Monday is a draft and it's going to suck--but I still have to get something down on the pages.  Mmm...nachos...

      Yep, I'm definitely down in it. I went to bed at 10:30 last night and still could barely pull myself up at 7:30. I am already thinking of ways to get out of class this afternoon and hoping my meetings this morning will be short. And it's not that I want to come home and get to work on this damn paper--it's that I want to come home and go back to bed.  Wonderful. I know what I need to do--just keep my head down, try to eat reasonably, and see myself through this. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no time for self-coddling. Shit.

      I think maybe I am feelling better. Walking Chancey was nice--it is a lovely night. He's still hyper, of course, but I'm trying to ignore him.  My shoulder is still really bugging me, so I am going to take a bath with some nice lime bath salts here in a bit.  I saw the funniest thing on our walk. We passed a house on our usual route, and the garage door was open. The inside of the garage was packed, floor to ceiling, with all manner of shit. Boxes, bags, loose stuff, bicycle tires...everything you could imagine, precariously stacked. At the very age of the rubble was an old man, sitting in a folding chair. He was watching a tiny (six inch?) black and white TV.  How random is that? I wish I could draw the scene, as the picture in my mind is far more amusing than the one painted by my brief description above.  I am hoping that getting a discussion going on The Phoenix about HPV will lead me to a breakthrough on this stupid paper. The whole thing (and then some) is written in my head and has been forever, but I just can't get it out. I don't know why I am so enamored with this topic...but I am. This is the trouble with picking topics you are highly personally invested in for papers--it's impossible to get started. I am rethinking entering an abstract into the Women's Studies Forum, as the deadline is Friday and I have less than a paragraph completed (though I have a huge marked up stack of articles right by my left elbow).  Adam is coming after all. He'll be here Wednesday night, just for one night. It will be good to see him, if I don't get any more depressed. If I do get more depressed, I am really going to dread having to play hostess. We'll see.  OK. My shoulder hurts. Bath.

      I think I might be getting depressed. Leaving the house to go to class this morning seems like more than I can manage. I am going to try, but only with the understanding that as soon as I get back I can return to my pajamas and not take them off again all night (i.e. skip my night class). I feel so overwelmed...and I'm not really sure why. Sure, I have a lot of work to do, but no more than I'd easily have done in this time frame at Reed. Maybe it's being here by myself and taking care of the dog and all that? I don't know. Maybe it's seasonal--the cold weather gets to me? But I have that distinct sinking feeling.  The Phoenix, which I love and am so proud of, is on the verge of becoming just another headache I don't need.  Basically, I need to grit my teeth and hold out until the end of the semester. Vacation sounds SO good. Until then, one step at a time, one foot in front of the other. First, a shower.

      I am in miserable fucking pain. It's only 11 and I really should stay up for a couple of hours and get some work done, but my shoulder is killing me and all I want is to take a bath and then get in bed with the heating pad. I spent the evening watching movies with Susan and Tony, which was fun, but it would have been 100% more enjoyable if I weren't in such fucking pain. I honestlly don't know how I am going to get out of my shirt this evening--every arm motion hurts. Driving is becoming increasingly problematic.  Chancey was really good on the walk and didn't pull on me at all, thank God.   We watched "Spirited Away" tonight, which I liked, though it confused me. I would like to see it on a big screen or at least a really large TV, because the animation was pretty cool. We also watched a short film called "Book of Life," which I wasn't crazy about. It was funny in parts, but it struck me as pseudo-religious pretention, which gets really old really fast.  I haven't heard from Adam, so I don't know if he's coming this week or not. I hope he is, because it would be good to see him, but I also hope he's not, because I will get even less done with him here. Maybe if he just comes for one night or something. We'll see. I'm sure he'll turn up.  Chancey is being pretty affectionate tonight. I think he misses Mark.  I should probably erase that, lest my stalker know I am here alone. Fuck that. Come and fucking get me.  Alright, I am going to work. I swear.

      I think blog updating is something you should do only when you want to. If it feels like a chore, don't bother. I will stop bugging you about it.  But if anyone wants to talk about anything that they don't feel comfortable talking about on their blog, I can certainly find time.   Now how's THAT for passive aggressive? :)

      Susan, you suck at updating your blog.  So there is something wrong with my shoulder. It's like the pain that I had when Chancey pulled my shoulder out that one time, but a bit less. And it's persistant. Taking a shirt off over my head just about makes me cry.   Great. A health problem. Just what I don't have time for.  Today I am attempting to outline my PD paper, do my research for PFM and PE, and not lose my mind. So far I am failing on all counts, but it's still early. I am also making curried squash and mushroom soup from the Moosewood recipe. We'll see how that turns out. The baking squash smells really good.  I really really want to take a nap. Chancey woke me up every two minutes from 8am on this morning. I finally just got up a bit after 9, I think. Damn dog. I am going to start locking him out in the morning, I swear.  For some reason he really wants to be outside, which is massively inconvenient for me, because it is muddy outside and he's a mess whenever he comes back in. He's not cooperating terribly well with having his paws cleaned off, either. So he's staying in here for now.  Why am I writing this and not doing my damn work?  I attempted to "chunk" my hair yesterday, but it didn't reallyw ork. The chunks are a lot smaller than I wanted them to be, and a lot more bleachy-orange instead of blonde. It's not really all that noticeable. I should probably fix it, but honestly I don't have the time or the desire today. Maybe later in the week.  Chance is panting at the window because he wants to go outside. Dammit. I wonder what his deal is? I think he wants to chase birds and squirrels.  Ug. I have got to get something done...  Or maybe take a nap...

      So I am sitting here looking out the window at Chance's attempts to chase squirrels. He is very dismayed that he can't climb trees and they can. It's hilarious.  We went to quite a good movie last night, Pieces of April. Teenditzactress Katie Holmes makes a surprising turn as the bad daugther in a falling apart family. That sounded very review-esque, didn't it? Well, I don't want to bother explaining the plot, but it was good, you should see it.  Susan cried. It was so cute.  It strangely made me miss my fam, though. Wonder if I will ever get old enough to stop missing my mom? I wish my mom were better at talking on the phone.  I have a big list of stuff to do today. Put chunks in my hair, lots of cleaning, the enivitable school work. Only four weeks left...  I can't think of a damn thing that is even slightly interesting to say.

      My head has been pounding for 24 hours now. It is making me less-than-thrilled.  I have lots to do at work now. I think perhaps I am on a little bit thinner ice than I previously suspected, due to all of this stalker bullshit. Sucks. The stuff I am doing is really really interesting, though, and I'd rather be busy than not.  May be going to a movie with Susan and Tony tonight (haven't heard back yet). Right now I am counting the minutes until I can leave, because my head is throbbing and I want to get my stupid grocery shopping done and get home ASAP. I came in a bit early, too, so I can leave in just a few minutes. Everyone else is already gone.

      Alright, you stalker fuck. If you are out there, come and fucking get me. Stop this cowardly emailing my professor and boss lies about me bullshit. Bring it the fuck on. I'm ready.  I cannot believe how angry this shit makes me. If it's supposed to be scaring me, it's not. It is just making me want to fucking kill. The nerve of someone to take shit from online and use it to try to fuck up my life, just because they don't like that I pulled out and started a new space rather than putting up with their bullshit anymore. Makes me so mad I could spit.

      My face itches. I have no idea what it is, but something is making me itch today.   My PFM presentation went reasonably well. It could have better, I think, but it certainly could have been worse. There are no words to describe how excited I am to be going to a three hour economics class this afternoon. None. Really.  Ug.  I don't know why I am dreading all of my responsibilities lately. I think it has something to do with menstruation. I think I will blame everything on menstruation until I cease to bleed.  I just had a tasty lunch of frozen pizza and veggies with dip. Dip is, in fact, the secret to raw veggie consumption. That and precut veggies. I need to procure more precut veggies, because I have eaten all of the baby carrots and sugarsnap peas.   I can't believe I am saying this, but I am tired of this weather. My house is always hot. It's fall, I want to wear a fucking sweatshirt!

      Ug. I should be very happy about today--all I have is an hour or so meeting at noon, the rest of the day is completely free (well, I have to drop the car off at the repair shop and then walk home, but other than that). But I feel very ugh this morning. I'd like to go back to bed. Showering didn't even make me feel better. Maybe walking Chancey will.   This period thing just fucking sucks. The problem with only having a period every three months is that I forget what a collosal pain in the ass it is and then I am surprised when it comes. It hurts, it's messy, I have a headache, I have cramps, and I just don't feel like myself. Most inconvenient.  I was reading an essay last night about periods and PMS and how they have been pathologized, etc. It was interesting, pointing out that if we lived in different kind of society, women might be able to see their periods as giving them times of enlightenment, creativity, etc. I honestly don't feel any more creative or sensitive or anything, though. I just feel put out. I wish I could make it go away completely, or just hibernate until it's over.  That is probably not a very healthy feminist POV, but there you have it.  As has been the case for awhile, I have an extremely large amount of shit that I really need to get going on, and I'm not doing a goddamn thing. My excuse has been that Mark needs to use the computer all the time until his NSF application is done, but that excuse is going to run out today. I wonder what my next excuse will be? I really just need to buckle down and get to work, but I don't feel like I have it in me right now.  Yuck. This is a depressing morning.

      I really need to just stop reading the stupid fucking Ms. boards completely. There is a thread there now calling for the boards to be shut down to get rid of all the fake-feminist "buzzards" (bet you can't guess what that would be). Another poster suggests that Ms. publish a statement of what feminism is so that people will know what it means when they sign on to it, since all of us buzzards obviously don't.  Give me a fucking break. These women are pissed off because the reasonable members of the boards are slowly trickling away, sick of fighting a losing battle (and yes, a lot of them are trickling to The Phoenix!) and they have nobody to pick on. They are only there to fight and to assauge each other's egos. I shudder to think what the boards would look like if Ms. did what they suggested.  What I don't get is why, if they are so fucking sure they have all the answers, they don't just start boards of their own? Why is it important for Ms. to validate that they are the one true kind of feminists? And I'd like to post that, but I'm attempting to stay out of shit over there  now. There is no reason to go over there if all it's going to be is a fight.  The whole thing is just such a fucking waste.

      It is a rainy drizzly Sunday morning, which is just perfect. It only compounds my desire to curl up in the papasan and read all day. True, I will have to read economics and stuff for my PD paper, but you can't win 'em all.  I'm in an interesting discussion about school dress codes and uniforms on The Phoenix. I'm not sure where it's going, and I'm not 100% sure I'm right, but it's an issue that deserves some real feminist analysis, I think. The subject of young female sexuality is one that most of us won't touch with a ten-foot pole, and I think that is a failing. It only serves to make young women more confused and stigmatized when we try to protect them in this way.  What else is going on today? We took Chancey for a nice, only slightly drizzly walk a bit ago. Mark is on the phone with Nace now, talking about his stupid NSF application. I will be SO glad when that thing is done.  Strangely, I am really looking forward to Mark being gone for a few days. I'm sure I will miss him like crazy and I will hate taking care of Chancey all by myself, but I really feel like I could use the time alone. Maybe it's just all the academic pressure and shit, but I just feel very compressed right now and like some personal decompression time would be just what the doctor ordered.  I am sad it's Sunday already. Weekends go too fast.   Still haven't heard back from Jenny or Natalie. Man do I ever feel lame.

      So far a pleasant Saturday. We slept until 11 (well, we were awake periodically between 7 and 9:30, but then Chancey finally calmed down and we slept some more). Then we watched an EXCELLENT UT football game. Then I went grocery shopping and bought mostly pretty decent food (I'm trying!). I compensated by having lunch from Jack n' the Box. I have plenty of stuff to do, but Mark is in the living room yammering away to his mom on the phone and I can't concentrate. Besides, I know the minute I start doing something on the computer he will come and kick me off. The NSP app is due Tuesday, so I really can't say anything.  Yesterday I did something incredibly brave. I wrote a long long overdue email to Jenny and Natalie apologizing for being such a horrible housemate and horrible friend the summer and fall we lived together. I really was umitigatedly awful. I did everything I wouldn't want done to me--I was melodramatic, I was nasty, I ignored them except when I expected them to be there for me, I was on the phone ALL the time...I was just terrible. And it's been something for which I have tried to lay the blame on them for far too long. I've owed them an apology for over two years now.  I have no idea if my apology will be excepted, or if we will be able to pick up some kind of friendship again. I don't know if I would be interested in a relationship with me if I were in either of their position--I think I would question my motives. But I'm going to hope for the best until I hear back from one or both of them.  What is interesting is what finally convinced me to write this email that I had been periodically thinking about forever. Friendster. Yes, the Internet friends/dating service. Erica sent me an invitation to join a while ago, then I got one from Simon the other day, so then I signed up and saw that quite a few people I know (including Natalie and Jenny) are on there. So that got me to thinking about having friends spread out to the four winds (Natalie being in L.A. and Jenny being in Chicago now) and how I really have done some horrible things to my friends. First I was just thinking about how sad it is to grow apart from people and all that, but somehow, sometime yesterday afternoon, I got honest with myself and realized that Natalie and Jenny and I didn't "grow apart"--I forced them away and they were totally legitimate in ditching my ass.  One thing I appreciate about myself as I get older is my increased ability to admit when I'm wrong. Now if I could just stop fucking up in the first place...

      More reflections on my dream...  The dream must have had something to do with going back "home"--both to Portland and to my family, and not finding things as I left them. I didn't really have that feeling conciously when I was actually there, though. To the contrary, I felt like nothing ever changes there, as if it's time warped or something. Every time I go to my parents house, even if my visits are six months apart, I can count the changes on one hand.  So why the dream, then?

      I had the strangest dream this morning...  I don't remember it all that well now, but it had something to do with running into JKD, who had her hair dyed blonde, at Fred Meyer on Hawthorne in Portland. They had changed the whole store around and didn't have any organic or healthy food anymore, etc. and both JKD and I were very upset about that. Then it went into something about being mad at Erica...? It was really intense. I wish I could remember it better.   I was really really upset at the store had been reorganized and I didn't know where anything was. I can see that store so clearly in my mind and it was like my whole world had been turned upside down. And JKD wasn't really JKD, either. She was, but she wasn't.  Very very strange.

      Mark comes back tomorrow! Mark comes back tomorrow!   I'm so excited I can hardly sit still. I have a bunch of presents and stuffed stockings waiting, so we can have our Christmas just as soon as he gets here (well, maybe a bit after he gets here). I'm also really excited for unmentionable reasons...it's amazing the things that two weeks apart will bring out...  I went on a total buying spree today, getting presents for Mark and Chancey. It was BAD. I spent like $200 or something. But it made me really happy, and now Christmas shopping is officially over and I can get back on budget. The pile of presents in the living room makes me smile every time I walk by. It's worth it. I can always say I spent my suit money from Nana (and my digital camera money from Dad, too, I guess). I don't really need to buy a suit now anyway, since Target bailed me out. And she'll never know the difference.  The cup of coffee I drank a bit ago is not sitting so well in my tummy. I wonder why sometimes it doesn't bother me at all and sometimes it just makes me feel like I am going to retch?  I suppose I should be thinking New Year's resolutions...I kind of already made mine (getting in shape, losing weight, watching what I eat, etc.). I've fallen off the wagon a little bit in the past week, but I think I can get back into it now that I'm home. I don't officially want to call that a New Year's resolution, though, because then I'll NEVER do it. Regaining financial control would be another good resolution...  Damn resolutions that require self discipline. What I can't I resolve to sleep less and have more sex?  Speaking of sleeping less, I have slept SO poorly the past few nights. Hopefully it will be better tonight. I have no idea what is keeping me awake. It might just be because Mark is gone, but that didn't really bother my sleeping patterns last time he was away.   Or it may be the coffee. Does coffee have more caffeine than Pepsi?  Sadly, my blogging does not seem to have improved since yesterday...

      My poor blog, neglected for so long!  I am back home now, and I picked Chancey up from the kennel this morning. He seems to have faired very well there, which is wonderful. Now maybe we won't have to worry so much about leaving him next time we go away.   I have a list of about a million things to do today, but so far it's pretty slow going. I am about to head out to Target to pick up a few things--hopefully I'll have the skills to install towel racks on the back of our bathroom door when I get back. Nothing hugely ambitious. I'm still getting used to how quiet it is here, compared to in Elkton. Enjoying some much-needed time alone, too.   Mom's surgery went well, draining as it was. We are hoping for the best as far as results, but it's too early to really be able to tell. She seems pretty optimistic, though.  It felt like I wasn't in Elkton for long enough. Anxious as I was to get back home and especially to pick up Chance, I wasn't really ready to leave. Strange how that works. I think Mark is ready to come home, though, even though he's only been in Minnesota a few days. I talked to him a bit ago and he didn't sound particularly as if he was having a good time.  Blah. I am obviously out of the blogging habit. I'm sure I will get back into it. Until then, though, my apologies to any reader who has made it this far.

      I swear, time goes so much slower here than it does anywhere else on the planet. Not totally in a bad way, but it's so strange. I feel like I've been here for a year already, and I've just been here since Wednesday night.  All is going reasonably well, though. It is amazing how much better I get along with them than I used to. No political arguments yet, and I'm pretty proud. We even discussed socialized healthcare, and there was no fight. Partially that's because they are beginning to come around to my way of thinking on their own ('bout damn time!) and partially it's because I am learning, in my old age, that some arguments are just not worth having. I'm not going to change their minds, at least not both at the same time, and even having the discussion just makes things uncomfortable. There are some things (well, most important things really, but I'm not going to think too much abou that right now) that I don't have any reason to talk to them about.  Being here is strange, though. I feel myself conciously having to struggle against reverting to my younger behavior. It really highlights for me how I am a different person now than I was at 16, or even 19 or 21. These past couple of years have made worlds of difference. Part of it, I'm sure, is pharmaceutical (mmm...antidepressants), but part of it is just growing up. I don't begrudge helping out around here when I am here now--in fact, I welcome the opportunity. Sounds mature to me!  Before I get too impressed with myself, though, I do have to admit that being here makes me eat asbsolute crap. I cannot believe the amount of junk food I've consumed in the past few days. According to my calorie count I'm still within reasonable levels, but there are very few nutrients in my system. I guess it's only for another week, though, and then I go back home, where it's easier to eat well. I'm not going to lose too much sleep over it. I'm keeping up with yoga and cardio, so that's good. Maybe tomorrow I will take another long walk. It seems to want to rain here, though, so maybe not.  I could go on and on forever and still have nothing new to say about family dynamics. I swear it's one of the very weirdest subjects on Earth. It's one more reason I don't want to have kids--I wouldn't want my kids to feel the sense of pity/incredulousness/worry/distain/love for me that I do for my parents. It feels bad enough from this side. I really wish my relationship with them could be completely untroubled, I wish I could understand them and they could understand me. But right now, I am pretty happy to settle for peace, even if it does feel a little bit shallow.

      Today was distinctly better. I think I was just grouchy last night. These are my people, as far away from them as my life gets, I am still grounded by them.  I took a walk "into town" today. Six miles, took about an hour and a half. It was really nice to do and I was really proud of myself at the end. My feet and legs don't seem too sore, either, though that might change tomorrow. I am eating like a giant pig here, which needs to stop (but won't, I'm afraid). There is junkfood everywhere, and the way people cook here for meals isn't exactly diet-friendly. Oh well. If I can hold steady until I get home, I'll be happy. No use trying to actually lose while I'm here--it's just not going to happen (unless maybe I find time to take that six mile walk every day...)  My mom is really really miserable. She's been worse every time I see her for ages now, but you can tell she's really at the end of her rope right now. And she's up to 3 or 4 pain pills a day, which can't be good for her. She says she is in pain and depressed and she doesn't know how much longer she can take it. I don't know what that means. I guess it means that this surgery better fucking do something. It's so unfair to see someone as great as my mom in so much pain. And it makes me feel guilty for not being here to take care of things. I don't think George helps around the house as much as he should. He does some, but Jesus, she can barely walk. She shouldn't be doing laundry and cleaning and making dinner and all that crap. Not that I think she'd stop even if someone else were here to do it, but still. I'm trying to do as much as I possibly can while I am here...and hopefully by the time I leave she'll be feeling better (though that's really unlikely, as it will take her six weeks or so to recover fully from the surgery). I hate seeing her like this. It's really aging her, too, which is sad, especially since she's really so young.  This is really odd to admit (and I hope Mark still doesn't read this), but being here makes me want to get married and maybe even have a baby sometime. I love my family, and I love that they are my family. And I love my family with Mark and Chancey as well. I want them to be...connected more, I guess. I long for something more "official." Which is really really strange, because I am completely politically opposed to getting married and I have absolutely no plans to do so. I was daydreaming today, though, about telling my mom she was going to be a grandmother.  It's in the air down here, I swear. I have to get away quick!  I saw Sadie today and she knew my name. She's only just started talking in the past few months, but she recognized me. Amazing, considering she hasn't seen me since August. She's a beautiful, bright, tempermental little girl. She looks just like Randi, but I think she acts more like me. Apparently she's prone to tantrum-throwing. :) I hope I get to see a fit before I leave. Proud to have passed that particular legacy on.  The wood heat is drying out my skin, chapping my lips, and making me sneeze. It's nice to listen to the fire crackle, though, and to stand in front of it until my ass gets so hot I have to go bury it in the couch. There are always good things about being home.  Tomorrow I think I'll have some solitude. Mom and George will be at work and Mitch is going fishing, so I'm just going to hang out and make Christmas cookies and watch TV and read. I hope this Janet Frame book speeds up a bit--her childhood doesn't interest me as much as it could, and I'm finding her a little bit unaccessible (inaccessible? INXSable?) I'm sure it will be more interesting once she gets to the mental hospital, though.  Speaking of, I think I will get under my covers and read a few more chapters. One thing about the wood heat--my bedrooom, as always, is ice fucking cold. I don't know how I stood it here when I was growing up with the door shut. I sleep with the door open when I am here now. Fuck privacy, I want warmth!!

      I thought I was going to leave that short and sweet and be done with it and go to bed, but apparently I was wrong. I feel like such a freak here. I should feel natural, these are my people--but I feel like I'm 9 feet tall and everyone thinks I'm judging them for being short. And maybe I am. But it's not my fault I'm tall, and it's not my fault they are short, and just because I am tall doesn't make short better.  That was a damn stupid analogy. I really am quite tired. This is actually the one place where I usually don't feel freakily tall. I should think of something better to compare this to.  Blah blah. I'm hardly even making sense to myself. The bottom line is that I'm not comfortable here. This isn't home. Home is in Austin, with Mark and Chance. Home was with Mark and Erica on Belmont. Home is about me and the people I choose not, not about the people who birthed and raised me. And that's a strange thing. I feel...disrespectful, I guess, for saying it. And then that's weird, because I never liked this place anyway. I spend 17 years trying to get out, and now that I am out, I insisit on trying to feel like I belong here and am not just visiting when I come back.  I just don't get it.  I've been saying "I want my mom" for months, and now I am here and I don't know what to do with her.

      Well, I'm here. And that's about all I can say about it. I have to keep in mind that it's always miserable at first and I feel like ass, but I'll get some sleep and adjust to the way things are here and I'll be fine. Not enough sleep last night and all day flying makes me cranky, and I'm sure that's part of it.  That being said, why does everyone here seem so goddamn stupid? And why do I hate myself so much for thinking they seem stupid?  God I hate this part.

       Going to Graceland   Today is the big day. In a few hours I get on a plane and head home for ten days. I feel mixed about it--excited, yet uneasy. I have no idea why I'm so uneasy. I'm not afraid to fly in the least. Going home is just stressful, I guess. Prepare yourself, o gentle reader, for daily updates on how I'm biting my tongue (or not) and the kind of uncomfortable self-reflection only your family can inspire.  It will be good. I'll get some rest, I'll hang out with my mom, I'll help my mom out. I'll get some reading done. Hopefully I'll study calculus, but realistically I won't. It will be a nice ten days.  Repeat five times and take a deep breath...

      On the blog I post on with my group of college friends, we've begun to talk elections. The more I post and read their posts, the more concrete my position seems. I am still working it all out in my head, but the bottom line is that I don't really support the Democrats. That isn't exactly big news--I haven't been registered Dem for years--but I *really* don't support them. I'm not sure we'd be in a much better position than we are now if Gore had taken office three years ago. I'm not sure we'll be in a much better position a few years from now if Dean somehow manages to win. I'm not sure there is much difference whatsoever between the animated corpses on the "right" and those on the "left."   I sound so stupid when I get started on this, but sometimes I think we're on our way to the revolution, and the only way we're going to get there is with four or eight or twelve or sixteen more years of bad conservative government. We're so fat and lazy, so apathetic and uninformed, it is no wonder we are in this position. The question is what will it take to shake us out of it? What will it take before the people demand real choices, before we demand a return to our civil liberties, before we demand that this country become what it could be?   In some ways, I hope that things *will* get worse, so that they can get better. This particular equilibrium is just not OK with me.   But then I wonder how much worse, and I get scared just like everyone else. I wonder how willing I am to fight if things do get bad. If abortion is outlawed, will I work on the underground? Will the line I draw between peaceful protest and actual organized resistance blur? When? How can I call for revolution when I'm not sure that I myself am willing to come out of my complacency and help it happen? Given how complacent I am, why don't I just shut up and register Dem and vote the-lesser-of-two-evils like everyone else?

       Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World   This movie was surprisingly better than I expected it to be. It's a big-budget Hollywood epic, there is no doubt about that, but the acting and dialogue aren't as bad as they could be (note that I am *not* saying they are good, just that they aren't as bad as they could be) and the special effects are great. When they sail through bad weather, you get sick to your stomach. Plus there is just something inherently cool about big old boats.  It also manages to meet most of my criteria for a decent period film. The cast never really looks clean, and they wear the same clothes over and over. They also keep fake accents to a minimum and don't try to overdo the "period speak" (althought they do a fairly irritating job of calling each other "Mr. Lastname" instead of by first name, which I don't quite buy). The medicine is grisly (if fairly unbelievable). The ships quarters seem larger than I would expect, but I guess you have to sacrifice some accuracy in the name of cinema.  I have never pretended to like Russell Crowe. I make no bones about it, I think he's a pompous ass and I don't think he has any acting chops whatsoever. That being said, he didn't irritate me half as much in this film as he did in  Gladiator  (and yes, I think  Gladiator  is one of the worst movies every made). And Joaquin Phoenix isn't in this either, so that helps. Billy Boyd, the guy who plays Merry in LOTR, has a smallish part, though, and he's awesome. I also liked Paul Bettany as Crowe's doctor friend, which isn't surprising since I got such a kick out of him in  The Knight's Tale  (which is, nonetheless, a truly terrible film).  This film has no women in it. It's hard to tell the minor characters apart because everyone is grubby and dressed the same and talks the same and nobody has a first name. It's l-o-n-g. All in all, though, it's one of those things that is worth $8 to see on the big screen, if you get the chance. If you don't, don't bother renting it.

      Ah, the Christmas season. Bringing unnecessary stress to a household near you!  Fuck this. Every year I get excited about Christmas in late October/early November. Every year by December 1 am so fucking tired of Christmas.  Mark's family's handling of Christmas makes me fucking crazy. They give each other Christmas lists, complete with name brands, prices, and where to buy. Where is the joy of gift-giving in that? I don't understand that at all. The whole point of gift-giving, the whole thing that makes it fun, is showing a person how you feel about them and how well you know them through what you pick out (or even better, make) for them. The point of commercialization it has gotten to when you give someone a brand-named and priced list makes it completely not worthwhile. And that is for immediate family for fuck's sake!  I feel sort of blah about my own present offerings this year as well. They aren't terrible, but they don't have quite the spark I'd like them to have. Maybe I'll feel better about it once I get everything together. One thing I do knwo, though, is that I didn't break the bank on them, and nobody got something they specifically asked for, but everyone got something I think they will like/use at least a little bit. So that's at least a step in the right direction.  I have no idea why the way Mark's family does things makes me so angry, but it really does. At that point, why bother with presents at all? Just save time and exchange checks.  I continue to be terrified about Mom's surgery. I'm sure it will be fine, but it frighens me nonetheless. I just want it to be over with already. I'm glad I get to spend a few days at home before we go to Portland, just to rest and relax before taking it on. Hopefully she will only have to stay at OHSU for one night.   I said I didn't want dinner, but now whatever Mark is cooking smells really good. Perhaps I should investigate. I'm getting a little bit concerned about my calorie counting, since it makes me think a bunch of times before I eat anything. In a way that's good, obviously, but I don't want to become someone who gets no joy out of food. I love food, and I plan to continue loving food. Just got to learn to love it a bit more responsibly.

      I dreamt about Emily's mom last night. I have no idea what she looks like (though I think I have seen a picture at some point), so she had the face of the mom in Pieces of April. I dreamed that I put my hands on her and willed her to live, like Shaedra talks about with her "raiki" or whatever it is. I had some miraculous healing power in the dream, apparently. And I was doing everything I could to make her get better. I woke up with a wet face and a feeling of complete uselessness. There is nothing I can do. Even normal, day-to-day stuff to help Brooke and Emily out would be great, but what the fuck do you do from 1000 miles away? As usual, I wish I were capable of prayer. Though I don't know if God is a help or a hindrance with real grief, I think s/he would certainly be helpful with "sending good thoughts." Sending just my own, unamplified, seems woefully insufficient.  My house is very cold, but my tea is very hot, so it all works out.  Got lucky on a book-buying spree at the Goodwill today. I picked up a multicultural family book for Susan and Tony, Backlash, Susan Brownmiller's rape book, Amy Tan's newest book, and Molly Ivans' book about the Clinton years. That, along with Janet Frame's autobiography (I have to remember to get that from Susan before I leave) should keep me busy while I'm home.  My sense of excitement about going home is pretty repressed now. I'm honestly terrified that my mom is having surgery and that I have to be there and see her through it and stuff. Have to is the wrong way of putting that...I want to, I'm just scared of the responsibility. But at least I have a place to stay in Portland worked out (thanks Sarah!) and hopefully I will be able to make a stock-up swing by Trader Joe's. Wonder if Mark would be mad if a stock-up from Trader Joe's is all he got for Christmas? I'm sort of out of ideas.  I need to get the relaxation packs put together. I meant to make some yoga cards for them, but I don't know if I have the energy now. I wonder how much laminating costs at Kinkos?  Obviously I'm just rambling. Mmm, more stream of conciousness blogging.  I really want to be able to help Emily and her mom. I can't stop thinking about it.

      Eesh.  I must just be really cranky today or something. I just popped over to The Strife to check it out, and now I'm all jealous and mad that it is taking away from The Phoenix (if it even is). I know how stupid that is--it's a different board, there are room for lots, etc. But I thought that board was supposed to be just for fighting, to keep it in its own space, and it seems to have grown beyond that and I know Bean doesn't even read the Phoenix now and blah blah blah.   I want everyone to like me. I have got to fucking get over that.

      You know how sometimes you think someone is your friend, but you aren't really sure, and you don't want to overstep your bounds with them and seem like a huge stalker if they don't consider you a friend? I'm in that situation right now. I have an acquaintance who I am afraid I scared off by being too "friendly" too soon. I hate that. It is so damn difficult to make friends, it's like I don't know the rules or something. I'm not trying to stalk her or take over her life or be her bestest buddy forever, I just...consider her a friend. She's someone who I communicate with on a more regular basis than most of my closer friends, so that, if nothing else, makes her seem like a friend to me. But maybe I'm projecting cyber-reality onto real reality and that's freaky? I have no idea. I feel like such an asshole for overstepping my bounds.  Blah blah blah. That made very little sense, I know. The bottom line is that much as I really try to be nice, I have no social skills.

      I'm feeling better about the weight stuff--I am much more confident that I can do something about it if it's that important to me. And given the very important point Mark brought up about the vericosity in my legs already and the compounding effect extra weight has on that problem, it is becoming very important to me.   But enough about that.  I am finished with my first semester at LBJ--the final yesterday went fine and now I really do have time off. I'm already nervous about the prospect (yeah, right) of learning enough calc to take the validation exam in January, but I'm going to give myself a couple more days before I start freaking out about that or my PRP paper. This is, after all, supposed to be vacation, and it's bad enough that I have to work 3 days/week during my supposed "vacation."  I'm having a good morning at work this morning, though. I finally found data for two of the things that were hanging over my head from the maternal and child health indicators list. I knew they were there all along, it has just taken ages to find them. I should take another look at the JJ stuff while I'm on a roll.  My baking bonanza was a partial success. My biscotti didn't meet the Mark test, and some of my shortbread broke and thus became Mark's tea biscuits, but I think everything else is OK. The gingerbread men and sugar cookies look nice, and I'm pretty confident the pound cakes will be good. The fudge is a little bit soft, but it should harden over the next couple of days, and soft fudge isn't the worst thing in the world. So tonight I need to start getting it all packaged up and sent off. The problem is that there are other things I wnat to send to some of the folks I am planning to ship it too. I think I might just skip that, though. No need to let Christmas be overwelming. I got about half a dozen cards sent out on Tuesday as well, so that's going pretty well. Need to do some more tonight. Writing out Christmas cards makes me feel strangely grown up, and signing Mark's name to them as well as my own makes me feel...married. It's odd, but sort of nice, in the same way it's nice to refer to Mark and Chancey as my "family."  Emily is off to stay with her parents for a few days. Her mom really sounds like she's not doing well, and I apparently I am talking about it a lot, because Mark said something last night about how surprised he is at the effect it's having on me. It's really two things, I think. The first is Emily and wanting to be able to make her feel better and knowing it's simply not possible, and the second is fear that this means my mom could get sick, too. I simply cannot fathom my mother being terminally ill. It's beyond my capacity to comprehend.

      So my mom is having back surgery on Dec. 22, and it is now officially my job to take her to her surgery (in Portland, about 3 hrs from where she lives) and be with her, etc. She'll be in the hospital at least one night and maybe two. I feel...old. Seems like a huge responsibility. Obviously I'm happy to do it, but I'm scared, too. And I wonder about the protocal--do I need to stay at the hospital the whole time she's there, or should I make some time to see some Portland folks while I'm up there? What is she going to need from me? Will the weather be OK for the drive? Can I handle this?  Jesus, I'm 24 years old. I sound like I'm 12.

      I'm going to be using my blog for something a bit different for awhile (in addition to my usual rambles). I am embarking upon a journey to lose 20 lbs. I feel that 20 lbs. is a reasonable amount for me to try to whittle off, and I have no plan how to do it yet. Once I formulate a plan, it will be posted here, as will my updates.  I think I am going to buy a scale. I know counting numbers is not a good thing, but I need some way to measure progress, and on a 6'0" body, you can't always tell by the way your clothes fit.

      What a generally irritating day. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.  On the plus side, my biscotti look great. Too bad I don't actually like almond-anise biscotti.  I don't remember the crampy post-Pap smear feeling usually lasting this long. It blows goats. I just want to take more Advil and go to bed.  Which I will, in a few minutes. Mark is walking Chancey without me. I walked him this morning and walked all over campus today, so I think I am OK for excercise for the time being.  I was wondering if walking Chance "counts" as 20 mins/day (even though it's 20 mins twice a day, usually) of physical activity? I don't break a sweat, my heart rate doesn't much accelerate, but I am walking. Is it worth the time, workout wise? Is there something else I should be doing to supplement it that wouldn't be too much of a time strain? I'd like to start lifting weights (arm definition, rather than just arm flab, would be great), but I can't muster up the energy.  I can't muster up the energy to write anything worth reading here, either. Fuck it, I'm going to bad. Probably best just to call this day a loss and move on to tomorrow.

      Dear Person Who Irritates Me,  Please stop going out of your way to irritate me. If you do not, I may start screaming and never stop. I may abuse my power like a petty little dictator. I may hunt you down and beat you with a wet noodle. I have a monster headache, I'm fat, I had to get a Pap smear today, and I think my dog is getting sick. I need to start holiday baking and I am not in the Christmas spirit. Mark is going to call me to come pick him up at some point, and that irrationally pisses me off. To make a long story short, I'm not in the fucking mood to deal with your passive aggressive horseshit today. Go ruin the hard work and soul of someone else for awhile.

      Fuck. So my post-doctor's visit freak out is about something totally unrelated to what I was concerned about.  It's about stepping on the scale.  I don't have a scale, I don't believe in scales, I try to never use scales. But I looked today when I was weighed at the doctor.  187.  187.  That's nearly 200 lbs.  I need to face facts. I'm overweight. First it was "no worries until I'm over 160," then "no worries until I'm over a size 12," then "no worries until my clothes don't fit." Well, all those things have happened. I'm well over 160, I'm a size 14 on a good day, and my clothes don't fit. I've gained well over 30 lbs. since high school, and probably 20 since I graduated from college. Worse yet, I've gained another 10 at least since I've been in Texas.  It's got to stop.  And I don't know if I can do that.

      Shit.  Why am I freaking out about this AGAIN?  I have to go and get my cervix scraped this afternoon (Pap smear/annual exam). I'm overdue, as I was supposed to get one in six months after my last one came back abnormal, and that was in May. I have a pretty definite feeling they are going to find something this time, something that's not just "a little weird" but that needs to be frozen or cut out. And I know that's no big deal, it's not even real surgery, it's easy to take care of, etc., but I'm still flipping out.  To make matters worse, Mark and I had sex for the first time in probably a month last night, completely forgetting about the "no intercourse for 24 hours before the pap smear" rule. I've broken that rule before and nothing has happened, but damn, you'd think we could have thought about that. (Sorry for the TMI, but I need to write about this and I have decided I'm going to try to censor my blog less, since I don't have another journal anymore--if you are uncomfortable knowing this much about my life, you don't have to read it, right?).  So. Blah. I'm all twitchy. Maybe taking the dog for a walk will help.

      I am sleepy.  There is no good reason I should be--it's been a relatively lazy day. I did get up reasonably early and go to Costco, but then I napped and just hung out and edited my final paper for policy development, ate yummy dinner and sat around watching the Two Towers DVD. I love Saturday.  I also love that classes are over for many weeks. If I also didn't have to work, I'd really be stoked, but I need the money and they need the help, so I'm on for three days a week while I'm in town. That should still give me enough time to write my PRP paper and learn calculus for the qualifying exam. Really.  Before any of that, though, it is Christmas baking time. That was the major purpose of my Costco trip today--baking supplies. I got most everything I need (economy sugar, butter, etc.), so I think I'm ready to get started. I sat down this evening and wrote a Christmas cards/people to bake for list. I may start tomorrow. Really, though, I should study for my PFM final first.   I just want school to be over. The PFM final is all I have hanging over my head, though, and that's only until Wednesday and I'm really not that worried about it, so I think it's all good.  I wanted to write about Costco:  I am embarrassed that I enjoy Costco so much. By all rights, as a thinking anti-consumerist individual (OK, in spirit but no in practice...), I ought to hate Costco. It's a bastion of more is better, bigger is better. Buy shit you don't need, and buy four times more of it than you could ever use. Brilliant plan. But something about the bizarrely large quantities appeals to me.  For some reason I am drawn to things that are larger or smaller than I think they should be. Miniatures, like dollhouse furniture and baby liquor bottles, and large stuff, like Costco. I wonder where the preoccupation with size comes from?  Anyway, Costco wasn't as bad as I expected it to be today. Going there on a Saturday morning a few weekends before Christmas was not a brilliant plan, but it worked out OK. I'm in list mode, so here's what I bought: -Two Towers DVD -holiday cards (they are peace-oriented and non-holiday specific) -NY strip steak -pesto -almond poppyseed muffins -brown sugar -white sugar -chocolate chips -butter -Oreos -Cheerios -a six-pack of colored bell peppers -granola bars -peanut butter (it comes in packages of two regular sized jars now, which is way cool) -Ghiradelli brownie mix -milk (they have organic 2% there, but no organic skim, which is irritating. I couldn't buy skim there anyway, though--I don't drink it fast enough)  Probably more stuff as well, but that's all I can remember.   Fascinating, huh? Aren't you glad you read my blog? I know you were dying to see my grocery list.  You know what is cool? Holographic snowflake tin foil. Very badass. One more thing that I should write off as silly, stupid consumerism, but I just...can't.  Oh well, at least I have something nice to wrap the holiday baking in, right?  I think biscotti and shortbread are the first items up for bids. Maybe gingerbread as well, if I can find a suitable recipe.

       Elephant    So foul and fair a day I have not seen.   I've been reading exisiting review's of Gus Van Sant's "Elephant" all morning, and I'm shocked to say that it seems almost everyone got it at least partially right. From Roger Ebert to Indiewire, I agree with at least part of all of the reviews. The truly amazing thing about the movie is highlighed by Ebert--Van Sant doesn't offer an answer. He doesn't offer an explanation. As the Indiewire review pointed out, the film depicts all of the every day battles and humiliations of high school in such a way that you aren't really left wondering why Columbine happened, you are left wondering why it doesn't happen more often.  Which is exactly what I've been saying about this school shootings for years. Why is everyone so fucking surprised? Don't you REMEMBER high school? Had the conflation of circumstances been a little bit different, I might have shot up my school as well, and I think, if you can be honest with yourself, you'll admit that you would have to.  Which is not to say that it has nothing to do with violent media, nothing to do with bad parenting, nothing to do with guns--those are all mechanisms, I think, that make these massacres possible. But whenever I think about it I come down to the problem really being high school. A prefabricated two-dimension wasteland in which it is so difficult to conceptualize anything or anyone as mattering enough to not deserve a good killing, especially in a culture where we don't understand what killing means.  My pontifications aside, "Elephant" is a stunning film. I can't compare it to other films, because it's nothing like other films. The only ones I'd compare it to would be "Kids" (it's way way better) or maybe "Welcome To The Dollhouse" and "Happiness" (it's way different, but accomplishes some of the same things, I think). The decision to use mostly untrained teen actors was a good one--they weren't ackward enough to be real teens, but they were a hell of a lot more ackward than the latest culled-from-Dawson's Creek bunch would have been. And they were more real than even the accepted teeny-bopper indie actors would have been. I felt like I knew some of them, like I'd gone to school with them myself, even if they did have slightly better grooming and wardrobe than the kids I remember. Strangely, I was especially pulled not towards the cool artistic kids, but towards the popular couple. Watching them, I was taken back to my own high school days almost immediately. And I didn't hate them enough to kill them, but I did hate them.  Another really striking thing about the film is the monotony, the flat, washed-out, bored way it's filmed. Every time someone pushes open the door to go outside the school (which seems to happen several times), I got the same feeling of what it's like to do that, how the entire color scheme of outside seems to be more vibrant than the one inside the school. And the sound editing was also amazing--the choice not to use contemporary music was a wise one, I think, and the way the whole film sounded sort of hollow was both haunting and subtle.  All in all, I was captured by it. It was the best thing to date I've seen about these killings. I'm sure Van Sant is drawing criticism for not taking a stand, not having a theory as to why this shit happens, but I think that's the true brilliance of the film. The whole situation is why it happens. Not just the kid having spitballs thrown at him in chemistry, but the hollow sound of the hall, the regimented look of the cafeteria food. This shit happens (in part) because high school steals your soul and without it you have no reason not to kill people. And that's a pretty dangerous statement.

      Given where my readership seems to come from, it's probably very passive aggressive for me to write about this here. Be that as it may, I'm going to do it anyway, because this is my blog, dammit, and I get to say what I want:  The Phoenix is officially giving me a headache. It's obvious there is no fucking way I can win. "More moderation but let me say whatever the fuck I want!" just doesn't work. I'm doing the best I can to be fair and objective and to read nearly every thread (which is getting tough, by the way, the way the place is growing and with pesky school and the pesky job and all that) and to keep my eye on everythign and make the changes that everyone asks for and please everyone.  Which really comes back to the problem: you can't please all of the people all of the time. I ought to know that by now, but I still INSIST on trying, thinking I am going to find a new way and magically be able to be everybody's best friend.  I don't know when I got so fucking eager to please. For a while there I was thinking it was a good trait, but now I'm not so sure. I don't want to lose what I think and what I feel in my quest for the middle ground. I've NEVER been a fucking moderate--why would I be starting now?  I really love The P, and I really want to see it grow and flourish, but I can't be everything everyone wants. Solutions to that are welcome. :(

      I feel remarkably less like ass now. It's amazing what nutrition, even a little bit of it, can do for you. I had an awesome sandwich for lunch, and I've actually been drinking water today (yay for me!).  I'm also getting a fair amount done at work, which makes me feel like less of a lame-o.  My five week vacation is filling up awfully fast on my little calendar.   I think my coworkers are having a thinly veiled argument. I am trying not to overhear, but it's not really working.  Yippee for the new format. I want to keep a movie list with release dates on my blog. Anyone know how to do that? I'd like to start writing reviews for all the movies I see.

      My stomach is upset, my glasses are dirty, the sound of South Park filtering from the other room is irritating me, and I really want to go to bed, even though it's not even 9:30.  On the upside, though, my first semester of classes at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Freezing Your Ass Off is over. PE was my last class today, and what a way to go out! The presentation went well, we turned the paper in, and everything is all wrapped up in a nice, tidy bundle. One class completely finished. And the most difficult class, at that.  So why am I so cranky? Decompression, I suppose. That and I have eaten nothing but absolute garbage today (really, it's been terrible), so I just feel like general ass. I'm going to do better tomorrow, I swear (she says, knowing full well she has NOTHING in the fridge to take to work for lunch tomorrow).  I am strangely nervous about going back to work--after being gone for two weeks, I feel like it is going to be uncomfortable or weird or something. That is dumb, I know, but there it is.  Ick. My stomach is really queasy. Maybe Mark can walk the dog by himself. I so just want to curl up and sleep.

      I've been asked for a kitty update:  She stayed here for a couple of days, but then followed us on our walk one evening and didn't follow us home. I was really worried about  her, but hoped someone else had taken her in. Then, on Sunday, we were walking Chance and we ran into Laura, a wonderful young Japanese woman who lives in our neighborhood with a beautiful and very well-trained Bernese Mountain Dog, Mokie. We stopped and chatted with Laura and Mokie for a few minutes, and lo and behold, that silly cat started darting out and teasing the dogs. I was so excited to see her, but I was even moreexcited when Laura told us that she has taken her in and that the cat and Mokie are tolerating each other fine. Laura was obviously really excited to have a cat, and she's able to let the cat inside and everything, so it seems meant to be. I hope she comes and visits again. She's obviously really independant. However, even if she doesn't, I couldn't wish for a better owner for her.

       The Station Agent   Put simply,  The Station Agent  is the most moving film I have seen in quite some time. It's a beautiful story about friendship, told beautifully, without any trace of sappiness. It has both a subtle humor and a subtle darkness that leave you feeling both bittersweet and renewed. The filmmaking is simple but flawless and the score (by genius Steven Trask) underplays every seen beautifully.  The story is about Fin (Peter Dinklage), who moves to a rural New Jersey train station after his friend and boss suddenly dies and wills it to him. Fin is quiet and it is clear that he moves to the station in search of solitude. Fin is also a dwarf, which is both what the story is about and not what the story is about. Fin's dwarfism is not ignored in the film, but it's not put on display, either--it comes up, but sometimes it doesn't come up. I have no idea what it's like to be a dwarf, but I think this way of treating differences (or even what some people consider "handicaps") in general is completely effective. There were times I forgot all about Fin's being small, but most of the time it was in my mind, it simply wasn't relevant, or was one of many relevant factors.  Fin's quest for solitude is in vain, as he is befriended in spite of himself by Joe, a hot dog vendor with a dying father (Bobby Cannavale), and Olivia, an artist suffering a great loss of her own (Patricia Clarkson, who should be on everyone's "one to watch" list after her performances here and in  Pieces of April . The story runs along in peaks and wanes of their friendship, with no real climax, but an ending feeling of comfort and of finally being comfortable not being alone.   Honestly, I think this movie is a must-see for anyone suffering a recent loss, and really for the rest of us as well. It left my feeling uplifted, but in a realistic way, not a saccharine-high way. The characters are all good people who live, who makes mistakes, and who fall apart and then come back together again.   I'd really like to see Peter Dinklage get an Oscar nod for this performance, and I think Patricia Clarkson deserves one as well. Doubt that will happen, because this just doesn't seem an Oscar kind of film, but one can hope. In the meantime, I am going to be looking for both of them, as well as Bobby Cannavale, in other roles. The acting in this film is outshone only by the amazing writing, a real boon for the first-time writer/director. I'm generally disappointed in movies these days, particularly ones that focus on teh story rather than the sound effects, and it's nice to finally seen an exception.

      This is how this test says mine works: Auditory : 64% Visual : 35% Left : 52% Right : 47%    Grace, your hemispheric dominance is equally divided between left and right brain, while you show a moderate preference for auditory versus visual learning, signs of a balanced and flexible person.   Your balance gives you the enviable capacity to be verbal and literate while retaining a certain "flair" and individuality. You are logical and compliant but only to a degree. You are organized without being compulsive, goal-directed without being driven, and a "thinking" individual without being excessively so.   The one problem you might have is that your learning might not be as efficient as you would like. At times you will work from the specific to the general, while at other times you'll work from the general to the specific. Sometimes you will be logical in your approach while at other times random. Since you cannot always control the choice, you may experience frustrations not normally felt by persons with a more defined and directed learning style.   You may also minimally experience conflicts associated with auditory processing. You will be systematic and sequential in your processing of information, you will most often focus on a single dimension of the problem or material, and you will be more reflective, i.e., "taking the data in" as opposed to "devouring" it.   Overall, you should feel content with your life and yourself. You are, perhaps, a little too critical of yourself - and of others - while maintaining an "openness" which is redeeming. Indecisiveness is a problem and your creativity is not in keeping with your potential. Being a pragmatist, you downplay this aspect of yourself and focus on the more immediate, the more obvious and the more functional.       urlLink Mind Media

      It is with reservations that I give  In America  a four-star rating. As many things as there were to love about the film, there were almost as many annoyances. So maybe it's best to start with things I loved? 1. The acting was great, both from the kids and the adults. I especially liked  urlLink Emma Bolger  as younger daughter Ariel, and was stunned by  urlLink Samantha Morton  as mom Sarah. Morton is best remembered, by me anyway, as the only redeemable part of  Minority Report . Also, she's got  remarkable  urlLink hair . 2. The story itself was nice--it was a tear-jerker, to be sure (I cried more than once), but it wasn't so damn unrelentless in it's depression-induction that I left wanting to kill myself.  3. The cinematography was very very good.  Now, things I didn't like: 1. No attention to realism in details--for example, if the radio station when they are driving into New York says they play the "best of the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s," then why do they go to the movies to watch  E.T. ? More irritatingly, how are they easily driving a gigantic station wagon through Time Square? And perhaps worst of all, how in the hell am I supposed to believe that  urlLink Mateo  has late-stage AIDS? Look at his arms for Christ's sake! I'm supposed to believe he dies a few months after that?  2. At the very beginning of the film, the family "sneaks" into America from Ireland, with no green cards, etc. It's never really explained WHY they do this. I mean, you can draw conclusions, based on the rest of the film, but that's a pretty drastic thing to do for no explicit reason. 3. Was the white rapper in the cab really necessary?  But there was one thing that put the film over the line from me and turned an OK movie into a really good movie. There's a scene pretty early on where the family is at a  urlLink carnival  and Johnny, the dad, risks all of their savings/rent money/whatever to try to win his little girl a stuffed E.T. The tension, the crowd, the sinking feeling in your stomach--the whole scene was just freaking amazing. I felt like I was there.  So, all in all, it's definitely worth watching, even if your suspension of disbelief will have to be set very very high for minor details that easily could have been corrected. And I think it's great that Samantha Morton got an Oscar nod for if--the kind of performance she has here doesn't get recognized often enough, and she has a smile that makes you glad to be alive.

      Chancey and I just had an encounter where he lunged and barked at a 2 or 3 year-old little girl.  I can't deal with this. I just called Mark and told him we need to give Chance back. I'm second-thinking that now, of course, but...this is just too awful. I don't know how to make him behave the way he needs to in order for us to be able to trust him, and if we can't trust him, we can't keep him. It's really that simple. We spend a ton of time with him, he gets all of the love and affection any dog could want, we work with him as far as training and stuff goes...and he still does this every once in awhile. And it only takes once. So far we've been lucky, but...  Fuck. I can't even believe I am considering letting him go. I love him to pieces. I would feel awful if he weren't here. I would feel like my family was broken apart. There has to be another way.

      No, I didn't make that up--rather, it was on a license plate holder in front of me on my commute to work this morning.  Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm in a sucky mood today. My sinuses are killing me, I still feel like potted ass, I didn't sleep well, I don't want to be here, and I'm just cranky. That being said, this particular license plate holder made me want to drag the women driving the Lexus it was connected to out of her car and beat her.  What the fuck is up with the scary religious threats? I don't see treating God like the bogeyman doing anyone any good with spreading the word. If anything, it only further alienates those of us who are not necessarily for or against the idea of God. I'm still thinking about it--I imagine I'll be still thinking about it ad infinitum, but that's another issue--but seeing stuff like that makes me not want to believe. I am not going to achieve faith by means of fucking threats.  Maybe I am completely overreacting. But I don't think so. The same car had a big Jesus fish eating a little Jesus fish on it. WTF?

      We just took Chancey for his nightly walk, and I had the brilliant idea to let him off-leash for a few minutes in the schoolyard. His recall is so good at home, I figured he'd run around a bit and then come right back when we called him.  I was wrong. We chased him all over. He was practically in the highway. But he eventually allowed himself to be caught (once he was tired, I think), so all is well.  Except Mark is having a fit and says he is never allowed off-leash again.

      I just spent an hour or so whipping up several batches of bath salts. I made grapefruit (my personal fave), orange ginger, blood orange rosemary, and rosemary lavendar tangerine. They smell great seperately, but the mixture of all of the smells, in conjunction with the amount of salt I got in tiny papercuts on my hands, is less than pleasant at the moment.  If any of my loyal readership would like a care package of homemade bath salts, lemmeno which flavor strikes your fancy.  I spent a good hour and a half this afternoon cleaning out and reorganizing my dresser and closet. My closet is now color-coded (I can't believe it took me so long to do that) and all of my drawers are reorganized and neat. I'm on a real organizational binge lately. I want to get some more clear plastic containers and organized our pantry cupboard (pasta in one container, nuts in one, dried fruit in one, etc.), but Mark begs me not too. He'd never be able to find anything that way.  This is the trouble with someone like me cohabitating with someone like Mark.   That and the piles of fucking papers everyfuckingwhere.  I have to go to work tomorrow morning. I didn't think I was going to have to go in until 11 or so, so it's a bitter pill to swallow that I have to be there at 9. Oh well. I could use the hours, and there is stuff to do. I'm not so sure the working from home thing is going to work out as well as I'd hoped, actually, because I haven't been able to get it together yet. Hopefully next week.  Ug. My hands smell mostly like rosemary essential oil, with this sort of background citrus smell. It would be nice if it weren't so damn strong. Also my left index finger is stained yellow from the coloring. Looks like I have jaundice of one finger.  I am fairly successful so far in my quest to stop biting my nails! They aren't past the ends of my fingers or anything yet, but they are to the point where they pretty much look like I just cut them short, rather than gnaw them off. I'm impressed.  Yeah, I know, it doesn't take much.

      What that last post didn't mention is that I've been on kind of a money-spending binge lately anyway, and I have easily spent $200 on "presents" for myself in the last month ($40 at Target, $60 on clothes, $45 on essential oils...the list goes on). So really, the question is whether I can justify using this money for a *new* present or whether I should consider it repayment for presents I already bought.  Shit. I hate being an adult. Particularly an adult who likes to shop.

      If you mysteriously had $200 that you didn't expect, and you felt compelled to use it to buy yourself a present, what would you buy?  This is not a hypothetical question. My dad sent me a check for $200 today, after taking back the digital camera he bought me for my birthday/Christmas, because Mark got one as well and we don't need two. I never expected to see the money, and here it is!  So the practical part of me knows I should just put it in my account for books and expenses and the money I always end up spending, even though I shouldn't. The other part, though, is screaming that this money is a PRESENT and should be spent as such.  What do you think?

      We took the Myers-Briggs Personality Test in my management class this week. Unsurprisingly, I am still an  urlLink INTJ . Apparently this particularly configuration is relatively uncommon. My I, N, and J are all relatively strong, my T is only a 5 or something.   I basically think this is bullshit, but, to be fair, the INTJ description fits me, for the most part.  Then again, so does the description of what being a  urlLink Virgo ...

      So the cedar count is way down today, and I still feel, as I told Mark this morning, like potted ass product. Could it be that it's not an allergy and I just have a cold or something? Or that I am allergic to something that isn't cedar? Or could it be that the fine folks at KVUE are just conspiring to make me doubt my self-diagnosis?  I know you're waiting with baited breath, so I'll keep you informed...

      In case anyone is wondering, if I have a bit of an absence from my blog it is only because I am in allergy hell and it's all I can do to get up and go to class. Extra time in front of the computer is just not an option right now. I'll be back with my usual witty insights about myself (and very very little else!) as soon as I can breathe and my face stops dripping.  In the meantime, recommendations for allergy remedies are oh so welcome. So far the over-the-counter Claritin knock-off is completely fucking worthless.

Who knew you could get allergies in fucking January? True, it is nearly 70 degrees here, but still. It's January! It should not be allergy season!! FUCK!  So yeah. I'm not sick, I'm chronic. And nothing is touching it. OTC stuff is a joke. I should probably go to the doctor, but that would require time and energy which I do not have.  Fuck.

      So I'm about to confess one of those things that I fear will make anyone who reads my blog hate me. I really hope it won't happen that way and it will be taken in the spirit in which it was intended, but I can't help but entertain a certain level of paranoia. Even more so than my Bennifer story, this could be taken the wrong way:  I am jealous of lesbian couples. Really, deeply, profoundly jealous. I have known this for awhile, but it was brought to mind again tonight. My intersex class met for a viewing of Hedwig, and one of the women in the class brought her partner. Watching the two of them together (not in a freaky stalkerish way, but just being exposed to their dynamic), I was able to pinpoint at least part of why I am so jealous of women in relationships with each other. They had both the romance and the comraderie. Mark may well be the best friend I've ever had, but there is still never going to be the sense of being on the same side between us as there can be between two women. I'm not talking about having a relationship and being friends--I can do that with a man, and I have--I'm talking about having a relationship and being the same species. I think it's socialization, rather than Mars and Venus, but I do think that women and men are profoundly different, and there are so many things that Mark is never going to understand, no matter how much he wants to and no matter how much I want him to. At the end of the day, he is my partner, but he is also, in a profound way that I can't shake no matter how hard I might try, my enemy.  When I was younger I thought my bisexuality was about my irrepressible sexual desire for women. I've said for a long time that I am more sexually attracted to women than I am to men, and in general I think that is true ( think that's also partially because as a citizen in this culture I am taught to be more sexually attracted to women than to men, but that's another tale for another time). But my jealousy of two women in love, spending their lives together has very little to do with sex. I've had sex with women. I have some concept of what it can be like. It's great, but I don't necessarily think it's better than sex with a man (and yes, my best sex has been with men). But I've never had a real relationship with a woman. Not as a grown-up. I've never lived with a woman I had a romantic attachment to, I've never shared my bed with a woman, etc. And that is what I am jealous of. I am jealous of having that feeling of partnership that I have with Mark with someone who has this shared set of woman's experiences with me.  I fear that I am making tons of generalizations about lesbian relationships, or that it is at least coming off like that's what I'm doing. That is in no way my intention. I am obviously not talking about every lesbian couple, or even every lesbian couple I know. I'm talking about potential. Part of it is the political potential of being able to exise men from your life and blah blah blah, but that isn't really the potential that interests me. The potential that interests me is the kind of bond you can have with someone who is like you in this fundamental way.  I think there might also be an element of lesbian couples (and I say lesbian and not "same-sex," because I can't think of a single gay male couple I know) not seeming to take each other for granted the way those in different-sex relationships can. I have no idea why that would be, and again, I know it's a generalization and not the way things actually are, but I've just seen a level of respect between two women that I don't think I usually see between a woman and a man. Perhaps it is that there aren't the same prescribed roles to buck up against and chafe? In a relationship with a man, I have to be  the  woman, but in a relationship with a woman, I could just be  a  woman? I have no idea. I just feel like it would be easier for my identity to be my own if I were in a relationship with a woman instead of a man.  The more I write the more this doesn't come out sounding like what I am actually trying to say. I'm afraid it's terribly offensive and I am totally misrepresenting myself. I am afraid I sound like the worst kind of "trendy bi." I'm afraid I'm not recognizing my own privledge. I'm afraid I am just missing the whole goddamn point. But I think I'm going to leave this up anyway, at least for tonight.  If this has been offensive, I am really really sorry. Please know it isn't meant to be, and please take the time to correct me. I really appreciate it.

      When I was a kid, I hated Sunday. Sunday inevitably meant being stuck at my house with parents, fuck-all to do, only books I had already read around, and extreme boredom. Seems like it was ALWAYS raining, my parents were ALWAYS home, and the day ALWAYS ended up in some sort of boredom-induced battle.  Now I love Sunday. Love. It. Waking up this morning was like waking up into a good dream. I've got my man (heh), my dog, it's unexpectedly sunny outside, and we've got all day to play. We're going to go to the park (or the pee-eh-are-kay, as we are forced to call it in front of His Highness) and make the most of this weather, even if it will be muddy. He scratched the living shit out of me trying to wake me up this morning, but I don't care, I'm still having a lovely Sunday morning. As I post this, I'm in my frog pajamas, I haven't eaten yet and am secretly hoping for challah french toast, and I am waiting for Mark to get out of the shower so we can take our beast for a nice walk. Does it get better than that?

      Having given some more thought to my Bennifer Breakup Disappointment, I think it is about fairy tales. In my adult life, Hollywood suffices for fairy tales, make believe, too much of the time. And given that it's supposed to be "too good to be true" it is sad that the relationships never work out. So when a couple for whom I actually have some positive feeling breaks up, it makes me question whether or not I believe in fairy tales.  If that makes any sense, which, now that I write it down, it doesn't.  To further humiliate myself, I will admit that I hope Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are very happy as well.  Moving on, today was a really good day. It was rainy and gray and my head hurts a lot still, but it was still really nice. Hung out at home, had an excellent and ass-kicking workout, finally had some damn sex--all in all, good stuff.  For those of you who know me IRL and read this, sorry. Yes, I do have sex. Once in awhile. Get over it. :)  I think it is going to be possible for me to go to Washington in April for the March for Choice, which makes me really happy. I knew I wanted to go, but I didn't think it would be fiscally possible. The North Texas PP, however, is giving scholarships to full-time students so we can go for only $75, and that pays for airfare and two nights in a hotel. SWEET!! So as long as my application gets there before all the slots are full, which it should, I think, I should be in. So all I have to figure out is how to get from here to Dallas and back for the flight (and I'm sure there will be carpools for that). So that's exciting. I think it will be a really re-energizing feminist experience. Or at least I'm hoping so, because I could really fucking use one of those sometime soon.  The Phoenix really does drain me. I really want it to realize its full potential, but my hope of that actually happening gets slimmer with every ridiculous in-fight. And nobody is immune, you know? It's not just people I don't like who are tempted to get in their jabs, is folks I really do like as well (and I'm certainly not above a low blow or two myself, to be fair in taking my part of the blame). I don't know why we like to shit on each other, but for some reason we do, and that really disturbs me. Is it just that this is how women in our society are taught to treat each other? Is this what happens in all frustrated progressive circles (I'm thinking of the New Left infighting now, or the gender problems and other problems in the Civil Rights Movement)? Or is it a problem with online communication in general, and none of us would do this in real life? I don't know what to blame it on, but I know it exhausts and depresses me, and some days, like today, I feel better if I just stay away (which is an abdication of responsibility that makes me feel guilty, but whatever, you can't win 'em all).  I'm beginning to worry myself a little bit with the diet/weight loss thing. I don't want to be turning into a calorie counter who sucks the joy out of food, you know? It shouldn't be a point of personal pride to me that I am down 9 pounds, because those are just numbers on a scale, and it shouldn't be a point of pride either that I burned 1000 more calories than I consumed today. I should be focusing on how I feel (which is actually pretty damn good, but I think that is due almost entirely to working out and has very little to do with food restriction), not what my numbers are. But it is harder every day to divorce my feelings from the numbers, and I think more and more about how I can get the numbers lower, what foods I can sneak out (for instance, it's amazing what limiting all beverages to water or tea will do for your calorie count)...I don't know. It seems unhealthy to me even from my internal vantage point, so I can't imagine it looks good to others.  And the bottom line is that yeah, I want to be in better shape and not have back problems like my mom and all that, but basically I'm fucking vain and I don't want to be fat. This all boils down to me not wanting to be fat. And that makes me feel like ass. So what if I am fat? Why should that matter to me? Why is my self-worth so connected to my body? Haven't I learned anything?  Apparently not.  But the chances I am going to quit thinking about it that way seem slim, so I just have to moderate myself as much as I can. Focus as much as possible on excercise and as little as possible on calories. And I have to promise myself that when I reach the goal weight, or when I reach the deadline, whichever comes first, then I am going to STOP counting calories. Because I am so fucking obsessive about entering every mouthful in to the website, and I know that can be a bad behavior.  Really I'm not worried about developing an eating disorder or anything dramatic like that. Rather, I just don't want to get any more fucking vain and self-indulgent.  Funny that I am blogging about not wanting to be so self-indulgent! As if this blog is ANYTHING but self-indulgence...

      So this is one of those things I should not be admitting in public, because I will probably never live it down:  I am upset about the breakup of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Well, not upset, exactly, but disappointed. I have been pulling for them through their engagement, their wedding-that-wasn't, etc. I wanted them to get married and be happy.  Why would I care about something like that? Well, that's a good question, and it is one I'm not sure I can answer. I think I just have this romantic notion of both of them being po'-kid-makes-good stories, and I liked the idea of them building something out of that together. Plus there was so much tabloid bullshit about their relationship, I wanted to see them prove everybody wrong and make it work.  Isn't that lame? Neither one of them are celebrities to whom I am particularly drawn. Though I've had a soft spot for Affleck and Matt Damon ever since I found out they wrote  Good Will Hunting  themselves, and their performances in  Dogma  made me even more sympathetic towards them, Damon has always been my favorite. And Lopez mostly annoys me, at least she has since she lost weight (I used to like her just for being a teeny bit bigger than the average Hollywood waif, but anymore she's really not).  Anyway, so they broke up and it makes me sad. And given the nasty presents they give each other (a Bentley, a pink diamond ring) and their bizarre male-female dynamic (he goes out to strip clubs, she learns to cook, WTF?), I should think their break-up is a good thing, but...I don't know. It disappoints me. I wanted a Hollywood fairy tale.  Gah. How humiliating.

      It's 2:30. The house is much cleaner, I still feel absolutely awful, as if my head is stuffed with barbed-wire. I've ordered $125 worth of books for my "fun" class this semester, I've started an application for an internship I don't really want, I've worked on my resume a bit, and I feel guilty for being out of bed but not being at work.   If I had the car, I'd just say fuck it and go into work for a few hours, but Mark has the car, and by the time I get there on the bus there won't be any point in being there. Besides, if anything is going to make me feel more like ass, it's the bus.  So here I am, wondering what I should do next. I honestly feel like getting back in bed, but I know it won't make me feel any better physically or emotionally if I do.   God this day sucks.

      So I'm not at work today, even though I am supposed to be. I woke up at around 6am with the world's worst sinus headache, which has yet to go away, and I didn't go in.  And boy do I feel guilty.  Today would have been my first day in this week, lots to do I'm sure, most everyone else out of the office...and I'm not there because I am too much of a wuss to go in when I feel like this.  I have got to get better and slogging through when I don't feel good. I've never been any good at it, but as I get older and get sick less often, I think I get worse. The thirty minute discussion I have with myself about whether or not to go to work when I wake up feeling shitty is down to about five minutes now before I give up and roll over.  This has got to make me look terrible in the eyes of employers. If I were an employer, I wouldn't like me very much.   So I'm here, I feel like ass, looking at the monitor is making it worse, and I can't figure out what to do with this day, since I feel like ass and I'm not at work, where I should be.

      I've added titles to my blog, because I really like other people's titles. Lemmeno if they are irritating.  So I feel guilty for not excercising today. Isn't that strange? I just didn't feel like it, so I didn't do it, and now I feel all ass-y, like I let myself down. Which is ridiculous, I've been putting in a good six days a week of exercise, and I walked the dog twice today, so that has to count for something. But now that it's too late to do any yoga or cardio before I go out, I feel like I really should have done some.  Sometimes it seems that the liklihood of my winning anything, ever, is very very slight.  In better news, in a few minutes I'm out the door to a celebratory evening with Susan and Tony. They have waited a long time for this particular celebration, and I'm really happy for them and happy to be going out with them tonight. Good food helps, too. The fewer calories I eat, the more obsessed with food I get. Which tells me that I am undoubtably doing something wrong, but that's for another time.  I want to find a way to keep a running list of movies I'm seeing and books I am reading on my blog. Does anyone know how to do that? Perhaps I'll just experiment...

      Day two of el sucko semester. I now officially have three classes, which is good. I'm the first person on teh waiting list for class number four, and I have a back-up plan for if that doesn't work out. This is also good. However, I am going to have missed the first meeting of at least one and probably two of my classes (and these classes meet only once a week), so that's bad. Especially because one of the one's I missed was economics (for some reason, the sheet said Tuesday and my brain read Wednesday--I have no idea how that happened).  So...all in all, it's still a big mess. If I actually get into the radicalism class, I'll be thrilled. If not, the international journalism class I have as back-up sounds interesting, and it's not in the morning.  So why am I still so stressed?

      It gets better after the first day, right?  Today was pretty much a disaster, no two-ways about it. And for some reason I am other-wordly exhausted tonight. I feel like I ran a damn marathon. It's ridiculous.  However, I will not be taking the quantative class, so that's good. I couldn't even do one problem on the validation exam. I heart humiliation. Guess I'll be looking into an online calculus course, perhaps? If anyone has one to recommend, I'm all ears.

         Classes start back up tomorrow. I'm not even a little bit excited, but I'm sure I will be once my schedule gets straightened out. Tomorrow I take the validation exam to see if I can take AQA I--I'm not expecting to be able to, and I'm really excited about my "back up class," so once that's all done I'll be a lot happier, I think. I know it is irresponsible to put AQA off until next year and all that, but I don't see how I am going to learn calculus tonight, so that's just how it's going to be.  Tony and Susan are here! Pizza and movie time!!

      So I've been curled up on the couch reading the latest edition of Harper's for the past hour or so. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday evening. I'm especially amused by the story about high school journalism that mentions my very own little teeny alma matar, and even refers to a letter written by my own mum.  However...  There is a reason I should not read the left press, or the "left" press, as may be more appropriate. Every article makes me want to change my life, start a campaign, march on the capital, DO SOMETHING, and I just don't have the energy to DO SOMETHING about everything. For instance, in this edition, there was a piece on Bush's Medicare "reform"--I already knew about that, but this piece reminded me what a fucking nightmare it was. Then there was an article about how much energy we use to feed ourselves, from the domestication of grain all the way through high fructose corn syrup and feed lots--terrifying. I knew a lot of it already, too, but that doesn't make the terror any less real. Then there was something else, then something else. So now I'm like afraid to go to bed, afraid to eat anything, knowing that my very existance is killing the planet, that my government is raping the world, etc. and I'm not doing anything about it.  A bit more objectivity and a bit less melodrama would probably be a really excellent idea. That or just no news, ever. And I think a news moritorium would probably be bad for my career.  Today's word of the day was irenic, which means peaceful or concilliatory. I like that a lot.

      This has made me feel better:   As Cool As I Am   Yea, there was a time I didnt like the love, I liked the climbers,  I was no sister then, I was running out of time and one liners,  And I was afraid, like you are when youre too young to know the time, and  So I watched the way you take your fear and hoard the horizon,  You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on,  Like you own them just because you bought the time,  And you turn to me, you say you hope Im not threatened,   Oh -- Im not that petty, as cool as I am, I thought youd know this already,  I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.   So now were at a club, you watch the woman dancing, she is drunk,  She is smiling and shes falling in a slow, descending funk,  And the whole bar is loud and proud and everybodys trying, yeah.  You play the artist, saying, "Is it how she moves, or how she looks?"  I say, its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks,  And as long as shes got noise, shes fine.  But I could teach her how I learned to dance when the musics ended,   Oh -- and thats not petty, as cool as I am, I thought youd know this already,  I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.   You tried to make me doubt, to make me guess, tried to make me feel like a little less,  Oh, I liked you when your soul was bared, I thought you knew how to be scared,  And now its amazing what you did to make me stay,  But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going,   And so Im leaving, you can find out how much better things can get,  And if it helps, Id say I feel a little worse than I did when we met,  So when you find someone else, you can try again, it might work next time,  You look out of the kitchen window and you shake your head and say low,  "If I could believe that stuff, Id say that woman has a halo,"  And I look out and say, "Yeah, shes really blond,"  And then I go outside and join the others, I am the others,   Oh -- and thats not easy, I dont know what you saw, I want somebody who sees me,  I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.  -- Dar Williams   Perhaps I will listen to it again. Perhaps I will post it to The P...

      OK. I am reaching the end of my cyber-rope. The bullshit on the various message boards with which I am involved or peripherally involved is really getting me down. I worked and continue to work REALLY FUCKING HARD on The Phoenix, and it seems like it is getting torn apart for NO FUCKING REASON. Because Bean is an asshole and can't own up when she fucks up everyone has to suffer? What the fuck is that about? The amount of damage a single woman can cause to a feminist community honestly stuns me. First it was Lucky, DarkOne, Tiffany...and now Bean? What the hell is this all about?  I shouldn't have to say this, since this is MY blog, but what I post here, I post as an individual, not as a Phoenix moderator or whatever-the-fuck. I have a right to my own feelings and opinions, and here they are. Deal.  So now I have second thoughts about everything. Again. Maybe starting The Phoenix was a bad idea. If we hadn't started The Phoenix, maybe there would be no Strife, blah blah blah.  AGGG!!

      Weirdness at my house last night:  It's about 12:30, and I'm fast asleep. Mark has just gone to sleep as well. All of a sudden, Mark sits up in bed and yells, "Holy fucking shit, get up!" I jump up to see there is a lot of what looks like fire outside our front windows. Aggg!  As it turns out, what I thought was fire was just flashing lights from our street being completely full of fire trucks. The house two doors down from us burned practically to the ground! By the time Mark went outside to check it out, the fire fighters had most of it out, but we fell back asleep an hour later to the sounds of them chainsawing through walls to get at embers. Then, when we walked Chancey this morning, we went by and the house is obviously completely demolished. The outside walls are still up, but the windows and doors are all gone, and the inside is just black. The lawn is covered with burnt debrise, etc.  Isn't that awful?  On the upside, it didn't spread, and the man who lives there got out just fine.

      Well, we made a valiant attempt. Here's what we actually accomplished: 1. 18 pages on the PRP paper 2. No studying calc 3. Vague conversations about ordering computer 4. Made lentil soup 5. Played with Chancey in the yard 6. Set up the new printer 7. De-cluttered office and organized shelves, as well as putting up new stuff on the walls 8. Didn't vacuum because we have no bags 9. Didn't get a bird feeder 10. Didn't pick up poop 11. De-cluttered large bedroom table, Mark still hasn't done his nightstand 12. Didn't write any thank you notes  All in all, not terrible.  I'm realizing, as I do periodically, that I am guilty of great financial mismanagement. Surprised? Didn't think you would be. Mark and I are overspending our joint account every month and having to keep it alive with mid-month transfers, and I'm not sticking to my weekly allowance (or even getting my weekly allowance out of the bank). It's all falling apart. Christmas does that, I supposed. Anyway, I need to look at the numbers and develop a new plan, pronto. Now that the holidays are over and I really don't need any new clothes until summer sets in for real, I should be able to decrease my weekly spending. As far as decreasing our joint spending--I'm sort of at a loss as to where that money is going. Well, not totally at a loss--it's going to the grocery store. We have GOT to spend less on groceries. It's fucking ridiculous.  Anyway, that's my project this morning. Figure out the financial crap. Then it's off to work for the afternoon. Yippee.

Set up new printer? 7. De-clutter office and organize shelves 8. Vacuum 9. Get bird feeder for O. 10. Pick up poop in the yard 11. De-clutter bedroom table 12. G. write thank-you note to M.'s parents for Christmas present 13. M. writ thank-you note to G.'s parents for Christmas present  The likelihood of me getting even half of this stuff done...? Well, it's 11:30 on Saturday morning, I've been out of bed for about 15 minutes, and I'm posting the list here rather than crossing anything off. What do you think?

      I'm having that same feeling I had Monday, where all I want to do is get back in bed and it's all I can do to keep myself upright. Which of course makes me worry that I'm pre-migraine again. I'd be really concerned if I had another one so soon. Another option is that I'm getting a cold (I am sneezing all over and my head is all stuffed up and I have a runny nose), or it's allergies (same symptoms).   Whatever the issue is, I'm awake and dressed and up, but I'm not getting anything done. I swept the living room and kitchen floors and had some breakfast, and now I'm fucking exhausted. I'm hardly going to make progress on the paper this way...

      This morning I was faced with a prime example of why it is difficult for me not to hate humanity sometimes.  I was in the car on the way back from dropping Mark off at work. I was at a stoplight next to a bus stop. At the bus stop there were two men. One told the other the following, loud enough that I could hear it inside my car, 7 or 8 feet away, with the radio on: "Man...it was the sloppiest pussy I ever seen. She was naaaasty. When she spurted, I thought she was pissin' on me, but she was just comin'."  Ew.  Just ew.  File that one under "never want to have sex again."

      So you tell me if this is stupid...  I was sitting on teh couch this morning, waiting for Mark to be ready to drive me to work, petting Chancey. And I got to thinking--why are we so much more comfortable with physical contact with animals than with other people? I would pet anyone's dog, but to even shake hands with the person freaks me out, and I certainly wouldn't touch them, or want them to touch me, in the intimate sense that petting implies. Does it have something to do with the power differential between us and animals? Or is it even simpler than that--would we all pet each other if we were all covered in fur?  Sometimes the "no touching" thing bothers me. I wish I could be more physically affectionate. Other than with Mark, I have a really hard time with it. Even hugging friends or my parents or whatever feels strange and stifling to me. And that definitely makes me feel like I'm missing something, because I like petting Chance, and Chance obviously likes to be petted.

      So the reason for yesterday's feeling odd and not wanting to do anything became very clear last night at around 10, when I developed one of the worst migraines I've had in a long time. Complete with light and sound sensitivity, bizarre rings in my vision, nausea (which I hardly ever get) and what amounted to a six+ hour ice cream headache. Yuck. This morning I feel like a wrung out wash rag. I am really tempted to stay home and in bed to recoop, but since the headache itself is gone, I'm up and dressed and going to work.   And hoping for the best...

      In light of yesterday's note to myself, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I woke up today (late) with a distinct feeling of laziness. I don't want to do ANYTHING today. I want to nap, read, watch TV, eat junk food. I am tired by the thought of driving Mark to work or walking Chance. There is absolutely no way I am going to get much, if anything, done on my paper or calc studying.  What I should do is force myself into productivity by going in to work, but I don't think I am going to do that either. The devil on my shoulder is saying, "you're on vacation, taking one day off is no big deal." And I'm listening to her.   Didn't I used to be an ambitious, productive person?

      Dear Self,  I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but just because you have two more school-free weeks DOES NOT mean you have no responsibilities. You have a 25 page draft of your PRP paper due on the 15th and you have to take a calculus validation exam on the 20th. You are completely unprepared for both of these tasks, having put, at most, an hour of work into each of them so far over your break. Also, you have to work three days next week and three the week after. Also there are a million and one house projects it would be great if you could get done during your time off, and you need to check out a gym.  Get on it. Stop reading stupid books (has anyone read "The Nanny Diaries"? It's hilarious!) and watching TV.   I mean this with all due respect.  Love,  Self

      Those of you who have never lived with me (which, by my count, would be all of you) do not realize this about me: I have a bit of a food obsession problem. I find a food I like and then I want to eat nothing but that, and I eat it gluttonously until I am so sick of it I never want to look at it again. Inevitably, I pick really awful foods. This has happened with both Entemann's coffee cake and Entemann's chocolate covered donuts, for example.  Frozen strawberries (pre-sugared) were another favorite, as were strawberry and lime all-fruit popsicles. In my coffee cake prime, I ate three a week, easily. Between Halloween and Thanksgiving it was frosted sugar cookies from the bakery at H.E.B. I ate five at a time. I'm not even kidding. Two or three ten-count cartons a week. It can get ugly.  Right now, Nocello (so, so so much better Italian version of Nutella) and raw apples is my food obession. Because I am calorie and weight and nutrition concious now, unlike before, I am holding myself to only having my snack (one sliced up raw apple and two tablespoons of Nocello, and yes, I measure it out) once a day. I'm very proud of my restraint. The problem, though, is that my theory about this has always been to let myself have as much as I want, and eventually (usually in two weeks or so) the craving runs out and I don't 'want it anymore. If I only have apples and Nocello once a day, though, is that going to happen? Or I am going to be a maintence apple-and-Nocello-holic, having to have my one apple and Nocello a day to survive?   (Note: After some time passes, my relationship with my previously-obsessee foods seems to even out. For example, I am now able to eat small(ish) quantitites of coffee cake and donuts, or have ONE popsicle, rather than one box of popsicles. I'm not ready to test the sugar cookies yet, though.)

       Kitty update  Chancey and I came upon our friends Laura and Mokie on our walk this morning, so we inquired about the mystery kitty. Sad new and good news: Sad news first: Laura couldn't keep her--apparently she and Mokie didn't get along as well after awhile. Good news second: Laura found a home for her with a friend in Dallas.  So she's OK and taken care of, but I won't see her again.

      I love the New Year. It seems...open. Like I can start over. I know that is sort of lame and cliche, but I really feel that way.  Things that are good: Starting a new year with freshly weeded sock and underwear drawers and a gift certificate to buy much-needed new bras. Taking the dog out to go to the bathroom and 5am and being warm in my sweatshirt. Curling up on the couch with Mark to watch a movie. Doesn't matter how bad the movie is. Finding the archaic bit of information I am looking for. Knowing that there is no real reason I have to get out of bed.  Things that are bad: Working on New Year's Day. Disappointing and boring bowl games. How hard it is for me not to bite my nails. Running out of toilet paper at 9:30pm on New Year's Eve, knowing nothing is going to be open until Friday.

      Do y'all remember the part in  urlLink The Goonies  where  urlLink Chunk  gets captured by the  urlLink Fratellis  and recounts everything bad he's ever done in his whole life?   In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle Max's toupee and I glued it on my face when I was Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog... When my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me out... But the worst thing I ever done - I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life.    Remember?  Well that was me last night. When I was trying to sleep. From about 2am until morning. Going over and over every wretched thing I've ever done. And there have been some pretty amazingly awful ones. It was an experience I'd prefer never to repeat.  Where the fuck did it come from, though?

      I don't really have time to be blogging today, but I need a break and I'm feeling verbose, so lucky, lucky you...  I wanted to write about my neighbors. There are two possible things going on with me+neighbors. The first is that I just have incredibly bad luck when it comes to neighbors. The second is that the problem is not them, it's me. Hopefully after reading these total unbiased accounts of my neighbors, you'll be able to decide for yourself which is the problem.  Note that I am leaving out dorm neighbors here, because that is a whole other problem.  Case study #1: "Arg Fuck" My junior year in college, I lived in an apartment with my then-boyfriend, Simon. It was my first long-term experience living off-campus and on my own. Retrospectively, the tiny apartment was kind of a hellhole, but at the time I was quite excited.  Or I was excited until I experienced Arg Fuck. Arg Fuck was my next door neighbor, an emaciated man with long stringy hair. Arg Fuck was, in my best guess, a man with a small methamphetamine problem. Or perhaps a large methamphetamine problem. This became apart to Simon and I when we were awoken the first time by his midnight tantrums. These were the most extreme tantrums I have ever had the displeasure of listening to, at least thrown by an adult. They included what sounded like throwing furniture down the stairs and repeated yelling of "Arg! Fuck!" (hence the name). They included screamed phone conversations with one of many women. Then, one night, they included what sounded like physical assault of a woman. That was the first time we called the police. There were at least half a dozen other times in the space of about six months, and many of those came with added bonus of having him come pound on our door after the cops left and scream that he was going to kill us. Keep in mind that this man had a balcony adjoining ours. It was freaking scary. There was also an incident in which he smeared blood all over the walls of our hallway.  We complained to the police. We complained to the management. Nothing happened. It was awful. So after that I moved back to campus. Dorm neighbors may be loud and obnoxious, but at least they aren't usually frightening.  Case Study #2: Don and Pauline After I graduated, I moved into this great house with two friends, Natalie and Jenny. The "house" was actually a tri-plex, with a small upper unit, a large lower unit, and a small basement unit. We rented the middle part, the landlord, Don, lived in the basement, and another woman, Pauline lived upstairs.  At first, it seemed like a good situation. Pauline was quiet, Don seemed like a pleasant old man (he was in his mid-80s, I'd say), and the house was great.  Then a few things came to our attention: 1. Our thermostat controlled Don's heat as well as our own--and he insisted it be way the fuck up all the time. 2. Don came into our apartment when we weren't there. All the time. He didn't even try to pretend he didn't. And there was a door that connected his place to ours, which locked only from his side. He often left us rambling notes, giving instruction, with many exclamation points and always signed off, "God bless." 4. Sometimes Don would come in when we were there. He called it an inspection. He was a WWII veteran. These occasions were very odd. He wanted to make sure we weren't repainting or anything, he said. What seemed more likely was that he was checking for alcohol and other contraband. He was not just a little bit Catholic and he had very specific ideas about what was and was not appropriate for three young women living alone to have around.  3. Don liked to make rules. No doing laundry at night (we learned of this rule when he came pounding on our door at 9pm when we were doing laundry, screaming at us about how inconsiderate we were), no washing your hair in the shower because it clogs the drain (yeah, right), etc. These rules were subject to change at any time and without any notice, and we may or may not be notified by screaming note or screaming voice. 4. Don was deaf. Don's living room was directly under ours, and although he otherwise lived pretty much in squalor, he had a giant big screen TV with cable. It was turned up so loud whenever it was on that we could not only tell whether or not he was watching a war movie or the Christian Broadcasting Network (his only two choices, apparently), but we could tell  which  war movie or what the sin of the day was. 5. After we'd lived there for a few months, Don tried to raise our rent by several hundred dollars a month, saying that he'd been mistaken about how much he charged us in the first place. This was only one of several times he tried this. We were always able to talk him out of it, but it was still weird. 6. I could go on and on about Don, but you probably get the idea.  Above us was Pauline. Have you seen  What's Eating Gilbert Grape? . The mom in that movie was Pauline, both physically and temperamentally. She had some sort of condition that caused her to be very very obese. What exactly that condition was wasn't ever clear. At first, she was very nice, she invited us up and wanted to meet us, etc. (she was housebound). Then it became apparent that what she really wanted was three free caretakers. She'd call all the time, asking us to run to the store for her, and later to come up and rub her feet. Her heat was always on and her apartment was always at least 85 degrees. And it smelled bad enough to make you gag, literally. I felt sorry for Pauline, she was sick and lonely, but she was also very demanding. Then, one day, I came home from work and kept hearing this weird sound, like a cat crying. I went up to Pauline's apartment and found her on her kitchen floor, having fallen and not been able to get up. I had to call EMS and they send the fire department as well, to haul her back up. It was humiliating for her and for me. She went downhill after that and moved out and into a nursing facility a month or so before we moved out (which we did as soon as we could get out of our lease), and she died a few days before we left.  Case Study #3: The 1331 crowd The next place I lived was a double-studio apartment in a very rundown building. The price was right, it was the first place I'd ever had of my own, and I was jazzed. And in general, my neighbors were OK. Except. Except that there was an old man in the building, an alcoholic who used to be the building manager and sometimes thought he still was, who would come knock on your door and solicit money. Except that my next door neighbor had a delinquent grandchild who beat on her door and threatened her in the middle of the night every now and again. Except that the person who lived above me bowled in his apartment every now and again. In general, though, it was a step up.  Case Study #4: Jack and Jill The next place I lived was the upstairs bit of a really great duplex in a wonderful neighborhood. Well, wonderful except for the methadone clinic two blocks away. Anyway, I lived there with Mark and our friend Erica. Below us lived to student from my alma mater. They had annoying matching names, so I'll call them Jack and Jill. Jack and Jill were nice enough at first--they were in their first place, they were students, whatever. Then we realized a few things about Jack and Jill that were a bit annoying. Jack thought he was a musician and played a guitar and sang, often late at night. Jack was NOT a musician. Jack and Jill liked to have loud-ass friends over. Fine, they were college students, whatever. Normal annoyance. Jack and Jill also liked to have very loud, very melodramatic sex. They sounded like porn. We heard everything.   All of that was minor, though, in comparison to the laundry problem. The laundry problem was as follows: the shared washing machine and dryer in the basement was hooked to their water/electricity. They asked us the first week or so we moved in if we’d mind paying them back for the water/electricity we were using, and we settled on a figure of $25/month. We thought that was kind of odd, but didn’t think a whole lot of it, didn’t want to rock the boat, etc. We found out months later than their rent was $50/month less that ours. This was, at least in part, because they had to pay for our laundry use. When we confronted them with this information, they told us we had to keep paying or we couldn’t use the laundry. It turned into a gigantic battle involving the (extremely worthless) landlord. We eventually won, but they hated us from then on and there were a few nasty encounters.   Case Study #5: The jazz musician	 This brings us to our current case. Mark and I love our house. We knew when we moved in that we’d be sharing laundry facilities with a man living in a one-room apartment attached to the back of our house. However, he was a nice-seeming old man in a wheelchair, we didn’t share any non-closet walls, and all we were going to be sharing was the washer and dryer, so we didn’t think it would be a big deal.  We were wrong. So wrong.  First, the annoyance was just his music. See, we were told he was a musician. We assumed, stupidly, that meant he was a real musician. He’s not. He plays what sounds like a little kids Casio keyboard. He likes to play it at 8am. Also, he does laundry nearly every day---at least three times a week, anyway. However, those seemed minor things and we tried to make friends with him. Before we got a dog, we asked him if he would mind a dog around/in the yard, and he said no problem. This was important, because his back door/small deck faces out into the backyard. Which we didn’t realize was shared space. But it is. But I digress.  Once we got the dog, Chance was understandably scared and confused when he went into the yard and suddenly someone popped up out of nowhere in a terrifying machine (wheelchair). We told the Jazz Musician we’d be happy to work with him in making friends with the dog, etc., so he wouldn’t get barked at and stuff, and he said great.  But all he ever did was yell at the dog. To make matters worse, he spread food out not only on his deck (which is low—at the dogs nose level), but in the yard as well. And then yelled at Chance when he ate the food, as I would assume nature for someone of the canine persuasion to do. The Jazz Musician calls the food “bird feed,” but it consists not only of bread and crackers and stuff, but also of whole fruit, sausages, frozen peas, you name it. He also throws cigarette butts out, which the dog, being a dog, tries to eat. We asked him numerous times to stop this, explaining that it is very difficult for us to keep the dog away from him/his porch when there is free food there. He hemmed and hawed and then said he’d stop if we got him a bird feeder to use instead. We got one. He hasn’t stopped.  Recently, the Jazz Musician asked Mark if he could have a word with him. He will only talk to Mark, not to me. OK, whatever. What he told Mark was that he’d like me to stop  “invading his privacy” by “looking in his house” when I was in the yard with the dog.  Yeah. Right. Like I want anything to do with his scrawny ass. If I look at his house, it’s because I’m trying to make sure he isn’t out on the porch, poised to yell at my dog for no reason. However, he sits in his house with his blinds (sliding glass door) open 24-7, often in his underwear. Even though it looks out on what is supposed to be our yard. So I can see why he’d feel like his privacy was in question.   Things got worse when he got a prosthetic leg (he’s a diabetic who had to have one leg amputated last year, hence the chair). Now that he’s more mobile, he wants to use the yard more. And that means we have to keep the dog out of it, because he is certain the dog is going to attack him (which at this point I’m not sure I’d blame him for) or one of his family members (his grandkids come over sometimes, etc.) He says that he’s going to “teach the dog a lesson.” This is terrifying, because if all 87 pounds of him tries to teach my 110 pound dog any kind of lesson, it’s pretty obvious who will come out on the bad end of it. And if Chance hurts him, then Chance gets put down. So we have to keep Chance away from him.  For awhile we only took Chance in the yard on a lease (what exactly is the point of having a yard then?). Recently things came to a bit of a head and our landlord (who is fabulous and 100% on our side, or at least it seems that way) put a fence down the middle of the yard, separating about 1/3 for him and 2/3 for us. So hopefully that will take care of it.  Some more things about this particular neighbor? He is on 19 different types of medication for his various illnesses, yet he grows a giant pot plant outside on his deck and our yard reeks of ganja all the time, even at like 9am. He also occasionally throws loud fits, yelling and cursing at nobody, although it seems, from what I hear (since I care so deeply about him and his life), that he thinks someone is there. He’s also irritatingly incapable of discerning what is and is not recyclable and how it should be separated, so I always have to take his stuff out of our joint recycling bins and put it where it should be.  Keep in mind that these are just snapshots of my neighbor experiences. All of this really happened, but a ton of stuff I didn’t have the energy to write down happened as well. What do you think—is it them, or is it me?

      There are a number of people around school today with ash smudged foreheads. As always, I'm struck by my jealousy of them. Maybe I don't believe in God (and maybe I do...I wish I'd figure that out), but I think I believe in religion. Or maybe not even religion, but ritual. I believe in ritual. I want to take part in these rituals, to feel their importance viscerally. Perhaps more than any other reason, I wish I could develop faith so that I could legitimately do that.

      Yesterday, for the first time, someone noticed that I'd been losing weight. At this point I believe I've lost 12 lbs, which isn't that much. In combination with general body tightening from excercise, though, the difference is significant, my clothes are fitting looser, etc.  Even though the weight loss is intentional and I'm working really hard on it and I was in some ways happy someone noticed, it was a very strange feeling to have someone acknowledge that my body is getting smaller. Even thought I intellectually know that even if I weigh a bit less, I'm getting stronger ever day, I still very weird purposefully making myself smaller. I spent so long as a skinny, skinny kid, I still have it in my head somewhere that I should be gaining weight, not losing it.   At 6'O" and (currently) 175, I'm hardly petite. There is little to no chance of my wasting away. So why am I embarrassed when someone notices I've been losing weight? Why do I feel the need to minimize it, saying, "I've lost a little bit, but it's not a big thing"?  It's a strange connundrum. Realistically, I don't think there is every going to be a "right" size. If I don't lose a lot more weight, I'll continue to feel "too fat." If I do lose a lot more, I'll progress directly from "too fat" to "too thin." There won't be anything in between. Is there for anyone, or is this just another lovely side effect of being a woman in this culture?  If it is, it fucking sucks.

      I have a great aunt...well, let's back up. Technically, she'd be my step-great-aunt. She's my stepfather's aunt. But my mom and my stepdad have been married since I was 4, so it's not a distinction I've ever really made. Anyway, I have a great aunt named Agnes. I wish I knew more about her life, actually, but the pieces I do know amuse and inspire me--she went to college at Stanford and became a nurse, even though she was born in 1912 or something on a farm in rural Oregon. It sounds like she sort of always did just about whatever she wanted. She apparently married a real asshole and that sucked for a long while, but he was dead before I was born, so I don't have any first hand knowledge of that part.  The part I do have firsthand knowledge of is her in old age. And she was a pistol! I remember once, after hearing I'd been sick with an ovarian infection, she wrote me a letter counseling me about safe sex and including the memorable phrase, "I, thank God, have never had VD!" Keep in mind that she was nearly 90 when she wrote this and you can begin to see how funny she was. And she valued education really highly, and having no children of her own, spread her wealth around to help a bunch of us in college. She sent me money every month for quite a while when things were tight, and I couldn't have made it through undergrad as well as I did without her.  She's been in an assisted living place for two or three years now, because she's gotten weak and because she doesn't see well and sometimes gets confused, etc. And this morning, my mom sent me this email:   Agnes had to be moved to a nursing home 2 or 3 days ago.  She fell a couple of times- didn't break anything though.  She fell in the night and was slightly dehydrated when they found her in the morning, but she's alright that way.  She just is too weak and dizzy to stand up on her own.  I think she had some small strokes too because the right side of her face droops, she only talks out of the left side of her mouth and it takes for ever to get a sentence out - but it's not garbled.  Also when I saw her yesterday she didn't seem to be moving her right hand. I didn't ask if she could though because I didn't want her to obsess about it. Anyway, I'm taking Thurs & Fri off and packing all her stuff up (nothing heavy though) so George and who ever he can find to help can move it to storage this weekend.  We need to get her out by the end fo the month which is Sun. or it will cost another $2000. When I visited her yesterday the only thing she seemed to want to talk about was you.  She wanted details on what you are doing - in college and what your future plans are.  Then, it took her a while to get it out but she said to tell Grace we love her. If you could send her a card - maybe a just thinking of you kind and let her know what you're doing.  If you have any photos of you and Mark and the dog maybe you could send her one.    My guilt, she is enormous. I didn't see her when I was home for Christmas. I told myself it was because I didn't have time, or because I had a cold I didn't want to spread to her, but really it was because she's old and she's sick and I don't deal well with that. The place she was in depressed me, and I don't deal well with that. I don't want to remember her the way she is now, so I didn't go visit. And now it looks like I won't get the chance. Subsequent emails from Mom confirmed that she doesn't have much time--and why would she? She's over 90 years old.  It's completely my fault that I didn't see her when I had the chance, and I accept responsibility for that. My question is this: if she is asking/thinking about me, what can I do for her now? Obviously I can send a card/letter and some pictures, but is there anything else?

      I don't know if I have mentioned this before, but my full support is behind  urlLink Dennis Kucinich  for the Democratic presidential nomination. Make no mistakes--I'm not delusioned enough to believe he'll actually  get  the nomination, but he is the only candidate I support at this time, and I am planning to vote for him in the primary. I'm not a registered Democrat, but they tell me that even us  urlLink Commies  can vote in the primaries out here, so I'll be at my polling place next week.  I support Kucinich for fairly simple reasons: we're in nearly 100% agreement on political positions. See, maybe I have it all wrong, but I thought that was the basis I was supposed to vote on--candidates whose positions I agree with and wish to see forwarded. Am I wrong about that? Because that doesn't seem to be how other people are thinking about things. Mostly, what I see around me are people trying to figure out how to beat  urlLink Bush . And don't get me wrong, I'm 100% for that. However, I don't know if I'm for that to the extent of actually being able to pull a lever in favor of  urlLink John Kerry . Besides the facts that I don't  like  John Kerry and I don't  trust  John Kerry, there is the little matter of John Kerry and I disagreeing on some essential shit. Does he take a stong stance against capital punishment? No. Does he come out for same-sex marriage rights? No. Does he support single-payer health care? No. So why the hell would I support him? Better than Bush? Sure. But am I supposed to be voting for the less of two evils? Has it really come to that? Is that the best we can do? Is voting a matter of choosing the best option on the ballot, or is it a matter of choosing the option you think might have a chance of beating the worst option?  I've only voted in one presidential election so far, and I voted for a third-party candidate. And no, it wasn't  urlLink the one  all good Dems love to hate. It was whomever the Socialist candidate was, and no, I don't even remember who it was. I didn't like my choices, so I opted out and voted with my chosen party. I don't do that too often--I vote Democrat more often than I don't--but I don't see how much sitting back and accepting the same breed of candidate from the Dems as the Republicans offer is making a damn thing better. Sure, these old rich white guys are a little more "Liberal." They probably won't fuck things up as badly. But do I think they'll institute actual change? Real progress? Frankly, no, I don't. And I don't see how we are going to get to a place of real progress if all the supposed progressives in this country do is play defense. Yes, four more years of Bush would be a fucking nightmare. Yes, I want him out of there. But in the long run, is selling out my principles for another four or eight years of half-assed Democratic rule really going to help anything? Would it be better to let Bush get elected again, let things get four years worth of worse, and then see if people are willing to suggest and fight for real change from real candidates?   Part of the problem, I think, is the entire institution of the presidency. I'm not sure we should keep it at all. Maybe our whole government needs to be reworked into something a bit more representative and a bit less easy to buy or be born into. But where could we possibly start with that? And especially where could we start with it in a time where the best we as progressives can think to do is to try to keep our heads above water?  Don't get me wrong--come Election Day, I'll be rooting for whomever the Democratic least-of-the-evils candidate is. But I don't know if I am going to be able to vote for him.

      I just went to a meeting and got a couple of nuggets of internship info: 1. I'm going to get an out-of-state tuition waiver after all, so tuition should be $1360, rather than $2300. 2. The internship is required to be 12 weeks long. 10 week positions will only be considered on an individual basis and you have to make up the extra two weeks somehow (with research or a paper or something).  In other news, tomorrow is Ash Wednesday. Anybody giving anything up for Lent? I usually do. I'm not Catholic (or Lutheran, or any religion), but I really like the idea of Lent. I wonder if that is insulting to those who are actually practicing? I certainly don't want to take over anyone else's holiday. I just like the idea of giving something up for a number of weeks and really having to think about the way I live...  Jeez! I just realized that tomorrow being Ash Wednesday means today is Fat Tuesday. Happy Mardi Gras, everybody! Too bad I'm not in much of a celebratory mood.

      Rereading what I just posted, I just thought of something I do find interesting:  Why is it rude in our culture to talk about how much money one makes or has been offered? I nearly went back and edited that last post because it seemed uncouth, but I'm not sure that's a social nicety to which I want to subscribe. It reminds me too much of union-busting, of enforced ignorance of pay scale between employees at the same company or people in similar jobs across companies. Why SHOULDN'T we know how we're being compensated compares to how other people are being compensated? Does it pose any danger to the worker, or is all the danger to the bosses? And if all the danger is to the bosses, how can we eradicate this particular bit of backbiting politeness?

      I am indebted to  urlLink Frog  for today's title. :)  I've been having a lot of what I would consider interesting thoughts lately, and I keep thinking I should write them down so that I can blog about them later and maybe actually get some content going on up in here, but so far, no luck. Instead, I make ten to-do lists a day. I think I need to go to "To-Do List Makers Anonymous."  My mind is pretty occupied right now with trying to figure out what to do about the internship situation. For those who need a refresher, here's where I am: 1. I have been offered an internship in Portland doing program evaluation. It pays well ($6500 for eleven weeks) and would be an excellent experience. And I'd be in Portland for the summer, which is both a (small) benefit and a (large) detraction. 2. As of yesterday, I've been offered a summer position at my current place of employment. It's a great little nonprofit and I'm enjoying working there. The money is decent ($13/hr for ten weeks). It's here. I absolutely adore one of the women I work with. But I'm not sure what kind of experience it would be and what connections I could get from it. It could be great or it could be largely a time suck that I don't get much new experience out of. 3. I am attempting to apply to a third position, as a legislative aide to a state rep. He's supposed to be a great guy and I think the position would be good, it's stuff I'm interested in working on (school finance, health and human services) and it would probably be the best option as far as getting "connections." Howeer, I can't apply w/o a reference from my current boss (see #2). And I think it would make for a stressful summer. And, although I know it's paid, I don't know what the pay scale is.  So that's where I'm at with that decision. I'm leaning towards the path of least resistance (#2). I think I'll probably have the least stressful summer that way. But I have to figure out how to negotiate what I'll actuallly be  doing  this summer before I agree. Advice, as always, is appreciated.  Gee, I thought that was going to be an interesting blog entry. And I was wrong. Apologies. I'll try to think of something more interesting to add later.

      I've seen two movies ( urlLink The Triplets of Belleville  and  urlLink Rabbit-Proof Fence ) since I last wrote a review, but I'm going to sidebar those for now in order to review Ani DiFranco's new CD,  urlLink Educated Guess .  To begin with, I have to cop to my history with Ani. I'm one of those uber-fans. I've been listening to her since  Out of Range  was her new record, which means I'm a fan of (gulp) ten years. I expect a lot from her. She's been the #1 artist on my soundtrack for a long, long time now. And like a lot of her long-term fans, I've been pretty disappointed by some of her recent releases and her shows. I have no idea if the creature Ani sings about is herself, or if the story she weaves is her own, but I've always just assumed it is, and therefore been more than willing to grow with her and accept her expansions (and, in my view contractions) as part of that process. When her politics dimmed in favor of her broken and breaking heart in  Dilate , I was right there with her. Even when she insisting on spending numerous albums recording with a band (folk travesty!), I was patient. I didn't fault her for getting married, I like all her phases.   But I think she may have lost me on this one. It's not the music--this album is back to just her, although it's a weird analog recording and some experimental mixing, rather than just her and her guitar. It's the utter lack of hope on the album. Even when she was wallowing in misery on Dilate  , I always felt there was humor, hope, love behind the bitterness. And frankly,  Educated Guess  is just bitter.  I understand that this may just be another one of her turns--the marriage thing didn't work out, either for Ani herself or for the character Ani sings about, she gave herself wholly and now she's disappointed. I can see that. And maybe her hope will be back on later albums--I hope so, and I'll keep trying. But as for this one, I dunno.  The album begins with a short poem,  urlLink Platforms ,as follows:  life knocked me off my platforms so i pulled out my first pair of boots bought on the street at astor place before new york was run by suits and i suited up for the long walk  back to myself closer to the ground now with sorrow and stealth    The poem sets the tone for the rest of the album, much of which is centered around needing to be alone, reconnect with herself, etc. In the second track,  urlLink Swim ,  she sings, "i let you surround me/i let you drown me/out with your din/and then i learned how to swim." Similarly, the 7th track,  urlLink Bodily , says "you broke me bodily/the heart ain't the half of it/and i'll never learn to laugh at it/in my good natured way/in fact i'm laughing less in general/but i learned a lot at my own funeral/and i knew you'd be the death of me/so i guess that's the price i pay." The trouble is that the way the songs are recorded, the way her voice sounds, the "I'll never learn to laugh at it" seems a lot truer than the "I learned a lot at my own funeral." It's easier to believe Ani is miserable, and harder to believe that she is learning.  Unsurprisingly, the political tracks are the album's strong points. Back to back on the record, urlLink Animal  and  urlLink Grand Canyon  show the only sparks I can find of the old Ani. In  Animal , she bemoans the imperialism, consumerism and "willful ignorance" of Americans, singing, "and there's this brutal imperial power/that my passport says i represent/but it will never represent where my heart lives/only vaguely where it went."  Grand Canyon , however, is the real gem, starting out, "i love my country/by which i mean/i am indebted joyfully/to all the people throughout its history/who have fought the government to make right." She goes on to speak specifically about feminism, both acknowledging the work we have left to do and giving a much-deserved nod of respect to those who came before us, which of course warms my heart:  people, we are standing at ground zero of the feminist revolution yeah, it was an inside job stoic and sly one we're supposed to forget  and downplay and deny but i think the time is nothing if not nigh to let the truth out coolest f-word ever deserves a fucking shout! i mean  why can't all decent men and women call themselves feminists? out of respect  for those who fought for this  i mean, look around  we have this    The album version of  Grand Canyon  doesn't warm my heart quite the way the song did when I saw her live last, when she raised her hands and looked around at an audience full of women, saying with wonder, "we have... this ." The album track does a good job at bringing back the memory of that particular moment, though, so it's pretty damn good.  Aside from the usual politics and the bitterness and hopelessness I mentioned, the other common thread I see throughout the album is a sense of worldly exasperation with the weaker sex. In  urlLink Origami , she sings, "i know men are delicate/origami creatures/who need women to unfold them/hold them when they cry/but i am tired of being your savior/and i am tired of telling you why." I was reminded immediately of Ani's much older work ( Make Them Apologize ,  Fixing Her Hair ) when I heard that, and it made me happy. It also made me sad, though--she's spent so long trying to make men into what she wants them to be, no wonder she's tired.  The albums final track,  urlLink Bubble , she hints at another kind of relationship, writing, "i want you to always remember for me/baby, if you can/how much you hated the woman/who made you a man/and remember for me won't you/back further before that/how you loved her like a boy/cried from the joy/when you weren't laughing." If for no other reason, I'll buy her next album to see where that goes.  All in all, this album wasn't any more or any less disappointing than the last few--it has a few bright spots and a lot of darkness. However, I can't write my disappointment in this one off to the music, because all of the musicians are gone. This is raw Ani, all by herself, and I never thought that would be something I'd be disappointed in.

      When I was in high school, what seems like 100 years ago, I wrote a short story called "And Then There Was Nothing..." The "moral" of this horrifying little gem was that those who strive for perfection end up with nothing at all. The plot involved two overachieving high school students trying to do well in Chemistry accidentally inventing something that blows up the world. As was my typical style at that time, the characters were based on students I knew and particularly despised for their perfectionist tendancies.  I was 14. Give me a break.  Anyway, for some reason I'm thinking about that story today.

      I just dropped this particular bomb over at my online home, urlLink The Phoenix , so I figure I might as well expound on it here as well.  I've been thinking about this for awhile, but I just got up the nerve to talk to Mark about it a little bit last night. It's talking to myself about it that's really tough, though...  I think I want to get married. I have been privledged to be friends with some really great married people recently, and I'm coming to believe that marriage CAN be something other than what I've always believed it to be. I am coming to see why one might want to be married, and why I specifically might want to be married to Mark.   I feel like a complete sell-out loser for even considering the possible positives here. I have been railing against marriage for years. The fact that I'd even consider it if pressed, much less bring the subject up myself as something I might want to think about doing in the not-that-far-away future, is so...strange and surreal.  What the hell is happening to me?

      Thanks to  urlLink Pinky .        You're  The Sound and the Fury !   by William Faulkner     Strong-willed but deeply confused, you are trying to come to grips with a major crisis in your life. You can see many different perspectives on the issue, but you're mostly overwhelmed with despair at what you've lost. People often have a hard time understanding you, but they have some vague sense that you must be brilliant anyway. Ultimately, you signify nothing.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     Other answers I got were:  Les Miserables ,  Waiting for Godot  and  The Poisonwood Bible .

      I have a big fat crush. One of the first I have had in a long time. She's a woman in one of my classes. She is from another country (Eastern Europe) and has an amazing accent and way of speaking. She's obviously very bright and is almost finished with a dual masters.  And she looks like  urlLink Angelina Jolie.  Or rather she looks like what Angelina Jolie would look like if Angelina Jolie were a regular person and not a cartoon character superstar.  So she's amazingly beautiful. Really, stunningly beautiful. And I'm afraid I am staring at her in class. I am trying really hard not to, but I'm afraid I am.  She sat next to me today, and she also has this really amazing smell, as well as very neat handwriting.  That's all I know about her. That and my heart skips beats when she walks into the room.  This puts me in an odd position. First, there's the being in a relationship thing. I am not too worried about that, because this isn't like a real attraction, you know? It is a superficial crush on someone I don't know. It's not a real threat or anything. But I still feel kinda bad.  Beyond that, though, there is the fact of even having a crush on another woman that is based so much on what she looks like. Hello objectification. And that puts me in a weird space as a feminist.  So yeah. That's where I'm at today.  That and I still have no freaking idea whether or not to take this internship.

      I got some interesting news today. I was accepted as a member of the 2004 class of  urlLink Oregon Performance Interns . It sounds like a great opportunity--training, good work, possibility of making a lot of connections, pretty decent pay, etc. The downside, of course, is that it would mean spending the summer in Portland, with Mark and Chancey staying here.  So it's a big decision to make. Not mine alone, of course. Mark doesn't seem to keen on the idea, which doesn't much surprise me. I feel selfish as all hell for even considering it. But on the other hand, if it's a good opportunity and it's only 11 weeks...11 weeks really isn't that long, is it?  As of right now, I don't have other offers, but I am hoping to have a summer offer from the great organization where I currently work. It would be less money, but it would be here...  Ag. I'm probably going to be obsessing about this for awhile. Feedback much appreciated.

      Something unpredecented and unpleasant happened to me this afternoon.  I was walking from the parking lot towards the building where I had class. My school is next door to a presidential library that has a big, if  urlLink strange  exhibition ending today, on President's Day, so there were people all over. It took me like 20 minutes to find a place to park.  Anyway, I was walking along, wearing baggy jeans and a semi-fitted t-shirt with no bra. This is a pretty standard school day uniform for me. Yes, I should probably wear a bra. But I don't like wearing a bra, so if there is any way I can avoid it, I do. Suddenly, someone leaned out the window of a passing car and yelled "boingy boingy boing! Nice tits, bitch!"  What, you ask, is so unprecedented about that? Street harassment is something I complain about all the time, though I have noticed it happens far less here than it did at home.  The individual leaning out the window and yelling at me was unmistakably a woman.  I've been called every derogatory name in the book, had all of my body parts complimented or criticized, been propositioned at least 100 ways, all from passing cars. But I've NEVER been yelled at by a woman before. And it's SO much worse.

      Two words: don't. bother. OK, so technically a word and a contraction, but you get my drift.  Now don't get me wrong--I didn't expect it to be good. However,  urlLink Susan Sarandon  has surprised me before by turning what I thought would be stupid roles into something worth watching ( urlLink Stepmom  comes to mind). And this film has  urlLink Geoffrey Rush  ( urlLink Shine ,  urlLink Quills ,  urlLink Frida ) in it, so I figured how bad could it be?  Boy was I wrong. Both Sarandon and Rush should be ashamed. The movie is a beginning-to-end formulaic piece of crap. The script is bad. The acting is bad. The premise is stupid. Even the costumes are ridiculous. And the film's warped sense of time is probably the most irritating part. It's set in the early 2000s.  urlLink Goldie Hawn  and Sarandon are supposed to be former best-friend rock groupies who haven't seen each other for 20 years. Early 2000s minus 20 years lands you in the early 1980s. So WHY are they talking about groupy-ing for bands in the late 60s and early 70s? Do the fucking math!  There is really no point in my going on and on about why this film sucked. Consider the premise. Consider Goldie Hawn. I got what I deserved for attempting to watch it in the first place.

      So it's now Monday morning, Mark is in lab, and the floors are still fucking filthy. He did do most of the laundry, though, as well as going grocery shopping and stopping to buy a book for me that I desperately needed, so I guess I can't complain too much. I'm not cleaning the fucking floors, though. They are just going to stay dirty until he does it, I swear.  Yeah. Right. We'll see if I can make it until noon.

Yesterday morning, or perhaps Friday night, I asked Mark if he would take care of the household chores this weekend, because I really need to write this paper and if there are chores to be done, I will use them to procrastinate. He said sure, just to tell him what needed to be done. To be completely honest, I was already irritated at that point (can't he tell as well as I can what needs to be done?), but I gave him a short list anyway.  Yesterday he played with Chancey and took a nap, as well as doing some magazine reading and going with me to a movie. He didn't do a single chore.  This morning I re-emphasized the importance of both the chores getting done and my not having to do them. He acted a little put out that I was bringing it up again, but he said he'd do it.  Now it's nearly 4pm. To his credit, he has cleaned out the fridge, cleaned out the bathtub, and done numerous loads of laundry. However, the house is still mostly a disaster and we still don't have any fucking groceries for the week. I believe he is currently having tea and reading yet another magazine.  So here's the question: should I be grateful that he is doing chores at all, or am I rightfully irritated that he's not doing them within my time frame and to my specifications? In a few hours, it will have officially taken him all weekend to do half-assed what I could have done well in a few hours. This is why I usually just do it myself. It seems like a better use of energy. I just start a project and then finish it and move on to the next project. Mark, on the other hand, seems to find it necessary to spend much more time sitting and thinking on what to do next than actually getting anything done.  I know that I have a tendancy towards psychotic neatness and that I can be very hard to please in this department. However, I really feel like he's not even much trying, and that is driving me up a fucking wall. I explained very clearly that there was a specific reason (my still unfinished paper) that I needed him to take care of this stuff in a timely way this weekend. Why can't he just fucking do it my way for once?

      I'm writing the second draft of a really difficult paper today (as I was, albeit in theory more than practice, yesterday). So I'll probably be posting random and totally useless stuff on here a lot. It's going really slowly. Every sentance I write I have to write multiple times, and even then I'm not happy with them. Didn't I used to be good at this?  School is stressing me out more than I'd like to admit right at the moment. This draft is due on Tuesday, I haven't yet begun to think about the reading for any of my classes for next week, and I really can't skip any more class, so I'm going to have to find time to at least take a stab at the reading. Economics is rapidly moving over my head and the quantity of work that is going to be required for my journalism class hasn't really sunk all the way in yet. I fear the rest of the semester is going to be rather long.  And blathering here rather than getting started on this damn paper is helping that how...?

      I just saw a rare thing: a mediocre book turned into a damn good film. The last time I remember feeling this much better about a movie than a book it was Sofia Coppola's brilliant take on  urlLink  The Virgin Suicides  . Obviously, that was a while ago.  I read  urlLink  Cold Mountain   probably four or five years ago, and it pretty much left my mind as soon as I put it down. I didn't think it was good or bad--I just didn't think about it at all. Something in the previews made me want to see the film, though, and I am really glad I went with that instinct.  First off, the film is well acted. The major characters ( urlLink Nicole Kidman  as Ada and  urlLink Jude Law  as Inman) are pretty damn good, avoiding the overacting that would be so easy to slip into in their rather melodramatically written parts. The real gems, though, are the supporting cast. Small roles by the truly amazing  urlLink Philip Seymour Hoffman  and  urlLink Giovanni Ribisi , as well as a surprisingly mature turn by  urlLink Natalie Portman  are fun to watch, but  urlLink Renée Zellweger  is the real star of the show as Ruby Thewes. Partially it is that Ruby is the best written part in both the book and the screenplay, but part of it something Zellweger manages to bring to the role herself. She delivers my favorite line, condeming war for what it is--men's bullshit-- "They call this war a cloud over the land. But they made the weather and then they stand in the rain and say 'Shit its raining,'" and she does it fucking perfectly. Just spot-on. She's funny, she's tough, and the juxtaposition of Kidman's spoiled Ada and her self-sufficient Ruby says all I needed to know about the small-town Southern women left behind during the Civil War.  Scenes of the war itself are, as is typically the case, too long and too bloody. We've seen that all before, from  urlLink Braveheart  to  urlLink Courage Under Fire  and in every movie about every war in between. There's blood, there's mud, there's smoke, there's death. If you've seen it once, you've seen it for every war movie, and I for one have no need to see it again. That being said, the cinematography is better than average, and other than a long battle scene at the beginning, the movie doesn't waste too much time on these things.  What it does focus on, and what I found really remarkable about it that I didn't feel in quite the same way from the book, is women struggling to survive while their country is being demolished. Left without resources, without money, and under attack from all sides (the Union Army, Confederate deserters, the Home Guard), we are faced over and over again with women fighting. Not fighting to kill, and not fighting for the almightly Confederacy, but fighting to survive, fighting to keep something for themselves and their children. It's a part of war that they don't like to make movies about, at least not in anything other than the most trite ways.  Another thing I found really admirable about the film was that the romantic relationship between Kidman and Law was not at the end allowed to overshadow the enduring relationship between Kidman and Zelleweger. To me, they were the interested and sustaining part of the film, and at the end they were what remained. You don't see that very often, and I appreciate it.  Finally, I was a big fan of the film's score. The theme song, "You Will Be My Ain True Love" (written by Sting and performed by the amazing  urlLink Alison Krauss ) is good stuff, but what really impressed me was the bluegrass-influenced music that sifted in and out of the scenes. The White Stripes'  urlLink Jack White  plays a Georgia musician in the film, and the songs he sang and arranged went a long way to help the viewer feel connected to what was going on in the South Carolina hills.  All in all, it was a damn good movie and I'd highly recommend it, particularly if you don't want to bother with the book. I definitely think the movie is a better investment of both time and money.

       La Resistance    I got excellent intentions And unbeatable excuses And I’m moderate in vices With the usual abuses  I got entertaining stories And a cheerful disposition And fanatical devotion To a kamikaze mission  And you can take your common sense  And head it out the door If you have no confidence  In what I’m fighting for ’Cause I love you, baby I just love me so much more  And so you see, my vanity comes through for me More often than you do for me And in the end I’ll choose the path of most resistance  And you’ll say, “It doesn’t have to be this way” And try and pull me back in play And rue the day you ever learned of my existence  I got well-examined motives And a pre-ordained direction I’m utopian by preference But I’ll settle for perfection  I got friends of every flavor  Evangelical and shifty And if I can crack this open I’m taking everybody with me  And you can take your precedents  And head ’em out the door ’Cause this ain’t like anything That’s ever come before And I love you, baby I just love me so much more      urlLink Check her out.

      My friend Emilin lost her mom today. I know there is nothing I can say, here or anywhere else, that is going to make that any better. I don't know anything about loss that hasn't already been said elsewhere--I have no advice, no words of wisdom--just my whole heart going out to you and your family today, Em.  If you haven't already done so, go read Emilin's  urlLink blog . It's one of the most beautiful, terrible, inspiring things I've ever read.

      It's Friday the 13th, the rain has turned to ice, and today's play list has a special meaning to me that I'm not going to share. Just the songs. If you can pick out the common thread, good for you.   'Cause I've got a little one who loves me as much as you need me And, darling, that's loving enough For a hiking boot mother who's seeing the world For the first time with her own little girl.  Holly Near, "Started Out Fine"   One night while I was out a ridin'  The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn The moon was bright as a readin' light  For a letter from an old friend back home.  And he asked me  Why do you ride for your money  Tell me why do you rope for short pay You ain't a'gettin' nowhere  And you're loosin' your share  Boy, you must have gone crazy out there.  Jerry Jeff Walker, "Night Rider's Lament"   Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp, Sister played the ringing tambourine. Mama couldn't hear our pretty music, She read our lips and helped the family sing. That little band was all a part of living, And our only means of living at the time; And it wasn't like no normal family combo, Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind.  Merle Haggard, "Daddy Frank (The Guitar Man)"   I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the sky Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes  Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I’ve been Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend Loving her was easier than anything I’ll ever do again  Kris Kristofferson, "Lovin' Her Was Easier"   It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat And Mama hollered out the back door y'all remember to wipe your feet And then she said I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge   Bobbie Gentry, "Ode To Billy Joe"   But I'll hang around as long as you will let me I never minded standing in the rain You don't have to call me darlin', darlin' But you never even call me by my name  Steve Goodman and John Prine, "You Never Even Call Me By My Name"

      In honor of the impending holiday of doom, today's play list includes some of my favorite lost love songs:   My lover's gone,  His boots no longer by my door,  He left at dawn,  And as I slept I felt him go  Returns no more,  I will not watch the ocean,  My lover's gone, No earthly ships will ever bring him home again.   Dido, "My Lover's Gone"   It's been seven hours and fifteen days Since u took your love away I go out every night and sleep all day Since u took your love away Since u been gone I can do whatever I want I can see whoever I choose I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant But nothing I said nothing can take away these blues `Cause nothing compares Nothing compares 2 u  Sinead O'Connor, "Nothing Compares 2 U"   And the years have proved  To offer nothing  Since you moved  You're long gone  But I can't move on  And I miss you-  Like the deserts miss the rain   Everything But The Girl, "Missing"   This borrowed dress --  It doesn't do much for me, but it's doing it's best This stolen purse --  it's got a bad history, but mine is much worse I've been down on my knees drunk While you're out doing standup You're making love to your punchline, baby  When this just ain't my town I'm just another luxury liner going down And I guess we're through Well lucky you  Heather Eatman, "Lucky You"   See the stone set in your eyes See the thorn twist in your side I wait for you  Sleight of hand and twist of fate On a bed of nails she makes me wait And I wait without you  With or without you With or without you  U2, "With or Without You"   And I'm here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know  Alanis Morrisette, "You Oughta Know"   well we put a thousand miles on that beat up forign car whenever weather would permit we'd make love under the stars our happiness completed by being attached and being free we would each take turns being bobby mcgee we were headed for salinis, but we hadn't got there yet some girls you don't remember, some girls you don't forget  Adam Brodsky, "Some Girls"   maybe the moral higher ground ain't as high as it seems  maybe we are both good people  done some bad things i just hope it was okay i know it wasn't perfect i hope in the end we can laugh  and say it was all worth it  Ani DiFranco, "Hour Follows Hour"

      This morning I had to run around and do some errands (go to the bank, buy dog food, that sort of thing). I listened to the anti-Valentine's Day show on  urlLink eklektikos  on  urlLink our local public radio station , and I am happy to say I've been introduced to two women whose music is worth checking out. The problem is that the set list isn't up yet, so I don't know who the second one was. The song was about it being harder to be friends that lovers and it was hysterical and poignant at the same time. The first was  urlLink Claudia Schmidt , who I have since found out is on Greg Brown's label, urlLink Red House Records . Cool, huh?

      A while back, my friend  urlLink Emilin  (scroll down to November 13) introduced me to the "Three and Pajamas Rule." Basically, the rule states that after three problems in a day, you aren't going to be productive (at work or school, say), so you may as well go home and put your pajamas back on, saving everyone lots of time and energy.  Well, by Em's rule, I shouldn't even leave the house today, because I've had three already and it's only 9am. Unfortunately, I don't think my workmates are familiar with the Three and Pajamas Rule, so I'm going to go in anyway.  Here are my three (so far). Please let this be it: 1. I wake up and realize that 1) my lips are so chapped they are split and bleeding; and 2) it's my turn to get up and walk Chance. 2. I get up and get ready to walk Chance, only to have him misbehave right before we're going to leave, in such a way as to require a 20 minute time-out. This is most inconvenient for me, throwing my entire morning schedule off. 3. While Chance is in his time-out, I make myself breakfast of hot cereal and milk. I take it to the office to eat and compute, like I do every morning. Before I can even sit down, I spill steaming hot cereal all over my hand, burning the living shit out of myself, and milk all over my computer table, meaning I have to move everything to take up the sheet that is covering the table and put it in the laundry.

      I got my hair cut on Monday, for the first time in months. This time, throwing caution to the wind, I got it cut into an actual "style," rather than just getting the ends trimmed. I now have what I believe is know as "long layers." It looks vaguely like  urlLink this .The bottom layer of hair is about two inches longer than the next layer up, and the top layer is probably 1.5 inches longer than that. No bangs, but the sides are shorter than the back. Thankfully, it is all still long enough to go up, so I have that going for me.  The problem with me having a hairstyle is that I don't really know HOW to have a hairstyle. So far I've been putting some straightening lotion stuff in it when it's wet (my first use of "product" in at least five years) and combing it out straight. My idea was that this would keep it from being puffy on the top  layer and frizzy at the ends. Results have been very mixed. It looks a lot better a day or so after being wet (I let it dry naturally and even with the straightening goop it's frizzier than I'd like). So my question is this: is there anything I can do to give it that flatter, day-after washing look every day? I can't just not wash it on most days, because of the whole working out and sweating thing.  Also, I want some color advice. What I have now is pretty basic dark brown with some splotchy leftover highlights. I want to do something funkier, but still look employable. Ideas?

It won't rain all the time The sky won't fall forever And though the night seems long your tears won't fall forever   Jane Siberry, "It Can't Rain All The Time"   Woke up to the sound of pouring rain The wind would whisper and I'd think of you And all the tears you cried, that called my name And when you needed me I came through  Skid Row, "I Remember You"   well there is no time there is only this rain there is no time, that's why I missed my plane  Greg Brown, "Two Little Feet"   There's rain down in the alleys Rain down in the street It was raining when we parted It'll rain next time we meet And I must, I must be in Oregon.

      The devil I know has returned. It's pouring here. Flooded streets and sidewalks, slow traffic, no visibility, getting soaked just getting in the car pouring. It seems as if it's never going to stop. My back yard is a lake, I had to ford rivers to take Chancey for a walk this morning.   And with the return of the rain, like clockwork, the return of the depression. Getting out of bed may well have been the biggest accomplishment I will have today. I have two classes this afternoon/evening, and I know I won't be there. I can't imagine getting in the car driving to campus, much less sitting in class. I'm struck with that familiar feeling of not being able to participate in my own life. The only thing that seems a reasonable option is getting back into bed, curling up under the covers where it is warm and dry, and staying there until spring.  The up was a lot shorter than I'd hoped it would be this time. I didn't accomplish much of anything that I actually needed to do. Perhaps the carnage was kept to a minimum, but at least I felt alive.   To come: playlist of songs about rain.

      Signs I have seen in the last 24 hours that I am probably going into a manic cycle: 1. I got my hair cut for the first time in six months 2. I spent $100 at Target on Valentine's Day crap, and I have grand plans of turning it into cute little Valentine's packages to send out to friends and family 3. I'm not cold 4. I had class for 1.5 hours and had to leave twice because I couldn't sit still 5. I talked throughout the entire class, using lots of phrases such as "this pisses me off..." 6. I'm seriously considering taking the dog for a run 7. I dyed my hair once last night and am wondering if I have time to do it again this afternoon 8. I'm not hungry 9. I drove really fast everywhere I went today, even though it is raining 10. I have a craving for very loud music  So here's the thing. I'm not bipolar, at least not that I know of. However, I have very obvious up and downswings, and this is the first time I've gone up in months. I've been tired and lazy and semi-depressed since before Christmas. Is this better? Well, if this is just a bizarre beginning rush and it's going to even out, then it's definitely better. If not, though, it's not. Depression sucks, but at least I don't get into fights and spend money when I'm headed the other direction.  Does this happen to anyone else, or is it just me?

      It has come to my attention that I check the same blogs, mainly those listed at the left, multiple times a day (sometimes multiple times an hour) to see if there is anything new on them. Taking alone, that seems kind of freaky. In reality, it's not that I am a stalker (I swear!). Rather, it's that I need more blogs to add to my "check out daily" list. So I'm soliciting recommendations. If you have or know of a great blog that I don't have listed, lemmeno?  Not just political/social commentary stuff, either. For reasons I am unclear on, I find the minutae of other people's lives fascinating.

      So I'm the first to admit that I have a regrettable lack of fashion sense. I'd really *like* to be stylish, but when it all comes down to it I'm a jeans and t-shirt girl through and through. So very little of the celebrity designer fashion crap makes any sense at all to me.  Ugg boots, however, are something that I really don't get. These look like something my mom would wear to feed the cows. It's not so much that they are ugly, but they don't fit into any of the pointy/shiny/high heeled/labeled/completely unreasonable for normal weather conditions criteria to which most "stylish" apparel, particularly footwear, seem to conform. How the hell did these get to be so popular with the celebs?    urlLink Don't know what the hell I'm talking about?

      By all rights, this should be a movie review for  urlLink Cold Mountain . Last night, when I was finally feeling up to food and entertainment again, Mark and I decided to go to the Alamo and see the film and have dinner (the Alamo, for those not lucky enough to live in Austin, is a great local chain of theaters that serve you dinner while you are watching the movie). But we got there to a line approximately 900 miles long, so we ditched that plan and decided on dinner out and then a DVD at home.  So I could be reviewing the DVD. It was  urlLink Igby Goes Down . However, I think everyone but me has already seen it, and I didn't find it all that interesting, so I don't think I'm going to bother. I gave it a hesitant *** (look to your left). One thing I will say, though, is that I think  urlLink Kieran Culkin  is worth keeping an eye on--he gave a damn good performance.  Instead, I think I am going to try my hand at a restaurant review. We went to the  urlLink 34th Street Cafe  for dinner, and I found it to be good food, medium to bad service, lousy ambiance, and lousy decor. I'd go back, but I'd be more careful when ordering (my entree was really overpriced) and I'd expect to wait.  The wine was one of the highlights of the meal. I've been enjoying a nice sweet glass of white wine recently, so I had a German Riesling that was really good. I don't remember what Mark had, but I thought it tasted like paint thinner. Our appetizer was a quail marinated in a maple and soy sauce over pumpkin raviolis. It has some wilted spinach on the side. It was really tasty, especially the quail skin and the ravioli. It took like 45 minutes or more to come, though, which is a bit much.  My entree was really good, but if I had asked how much the special was before I ordered it, I would have had something else. It wasn't worth $25. It was a pan-seared piece of red snapper over a pesto couscous. I wasn't sure what pesto couscous would be like, but it was amazingly good--sort of creamy and studded with really excellent quality cherry tomatoes and yellow bell peppers. Mark had oriechetta pasta with boar sausage and a chipotle cream sauce. He wasn't all that impressed, but I just had his leftovers for dinner tonight and I thought it was pretty good. The spicy chipolte flavor was a really welcome surprise in a cream sauce, and the sausage had a great flavor.  It took a really long time to get a dessert menu, and when I did, I asked the person who stopped by our table (not our original waitperson, a second person) what was meant by "Mexican Vanilla Wedding Cake" on the menu. I wanted to make sure it wasn't vanilla Mexican Wedding Cake, which would be very different. His smart-ass response was, "It's exactly what it says. Wedding cake flavored with Mexican vanilla." So helpful. I ordered it anyway, though, and it was really good, except that it needed some fruit or a fruit sauce to cut the vanilla/sweetness. It came with one strawberry, and for a piece of four-layer cake, that wasn't enough.   I have to stop here, though, and give Mexican vanilla it's due. Before I moved down here, I'd had things that claimed to be Mexican vanilla, but the stuff they give you under that name here is a totally different (and nearly transcendent) experience. It's amazing. There's something slightly herbal about it, something slightly alcoholic...I can't even explain it. Suffice to say that if you haven't tried it, you should.  Anyway, so that was our meal. The ambiance of the place was very strange and industrial, the plastic chairs reminded me way too much of the ones in my high school cafeteria, and our table was in the path of all of the wait staff, so our chairs kept getting bumped and stuff. We did, however, see a woman in a long shiny leather-esque coat just like  urlLink Trinity , so that was pretty funny.

      I've been thinking a bit this evening about what the point of my having a blog is. I think of blogs as somewhat like self-published personal columns in newspapers--you can write whatever you want, you are constrained only by your own imagination, blada blada blah. The trouble is, I've had the uniquely horrifying experience of having a newspaper column, and I hated it. I thought it would be fun--a platform from which I could rant. But I was 17 and I didn't like being edited and I really didn't like taking responsibility for what I wrote.  Well, looking back, that was pretty damn immature of me, and I'm sad to admit that I haven't changed all that much in the past seven years.  When I first started blogging, I didn't have any readers. Nobody knew it was here (at least I don't think they did), and I wasn't really advertising. At that point, my blog was a glorified online journal--it was just me rambling about my life, with no hopes of sparking discussion or soliciting advice or entertaining or anything.  The trouble is that now I *do* have an audience--both people I know online and people I know IRL read this thing--and I'm still writing like it's just for me. My tag line up there about dedicated narcissism and daily ramblings isn't self-deprecating--it's absolutely true. I don't give much if any thought to whether or not what I write will be interesting to an audience (and certainly not whether or not it will be interesting to the specific audience I have). In fact, I don't even give much thought to whether or not I'm being offensive. I'm still writing like this is my locked diary, even though I am aware that people actually read this--some of them even read it regularly.  So in thinking about this I realized that I want to change my focus here a little bit. I'm still going to write about my life and stuff that is going on with me, my reflections on stuff, etc., but I need to try to re-learn (or, more honestly, learn for the first time) that there is a difference between writing for an audience and writing just because that's what I do. What I'm doing here has all too often been the latter, and I'd like it to be the former. I *want* people to read this--I like having an audience. So I need to write for one.  At least those are my thoughts ATM. If you read my blog regularly and have any thoughts about my trying to turn over a bit of a new leaf, please leave a comment. In the meantime, I think I am going to try to generate some thoughts on a topic of more global interest than my personal life (OK, so it will probably just be a movie review or something, but bear with me), as well as reacquaint myself with spell-check.

      So this is one of those things I have posted about a few times in the last couple of days, then erased the posts and hoped nobody saw them. So if you see this and then come back and it's gone, don't worry--I probably just thought better of it again.  It is something I really want to write/talk about, but I'm just not sure how.  I made a therapist appointment. Finally. After more than a year of putting it off. It's a week from Monday, and I'm terrified. What if I don't like her? What if I just get in there and break the fuck down and everything comes out at once? What if she doesn't like me? What if she says there is something essentially wrong with my personality and I'll never be fixed? What if she says there is nothing fixable wrong with me and this is just the way I am? Worst yet, what if she says nothing?  What if all she wants to talk about are my parents?  I have no idea what to expect. I have no idea if this will help. I'm terrified that the experience will just be one more thing to feel shitty about.  I'm really really tempted to call the whole thing of. Yes, I accept that I could probably be very helped by therapy, but WHAT IF I'M NOT?

      So I just made a couple of mistakes.  The first was to try the Teddy Grahams again.   The second was, as I was travelling through blogs and ljs I hadn't read in a while, go to the lj of this particularly vile little person whom I have encountered a bit online at a message board where I used to post. VLP (as I'll call her here) has made it clear on her lj that she reads the blogs of several of my online friends--she makes nasty and completely inappropriate comments about them on her lj. I was dimly aware of this, as it had been brought to my attention before, but hadn't given it a ton of thought.  However.  Her latest entry said something really fucking horrible about someone I really like, using information gleaned from an entry on the best blog I've ever read. Not only did she use the term "white trash," which is just fucking unacceptable in any context, but she took a really low shot at someone who is obviously doing the best she can, and the best she can seems to me to be a pretty damn good job.   I honestly don't get what's up with VLP. Why in the world would she waste her time and energy reading blogs of people she professes to hate (as much as you can "hate" anyone you are only acquainted with online) and then bashing them? Is she really that desperate for blog-fodder?  (Here you might ask if *I* am really that desperate for blog-fodder, but I do actually have a point in recounting this, so be patient--I'll get there.)  So, in my infinite sick-person rationality, I start yeling at VLP when I read this. Really yelling--top of my lungs and all that.   And then it hits me.  She isn't here. I don't *know* her. I'm screaming at a goddamn computer screen. This is just as ineffectual as it is when I watch Shrub on TV and scream at him. All it does is make my throat sore and scare the dog.  At what point in our development as cyber-people, or at least in my personal development (not that I believe for a second that nobody else does this...) did shit that happens online take on this reallife quality? I remember when I first started posting at my first message board, quite some time ago--it was fun precisely because it had nothing to do with my real life. It was something invented, like a story or (I can't believe I'm about to admit this) like playing an RPG. It was completely seperate from reality, and I could and did turn it off whenever I chose. I certainly didn't think I had personal relationships with any of the other posters, good or bad. Good ones amused me the same way characters I like on a TV show might, and bad ones irritated me like Raymond (yes, I hate Raymond--everybody may love Raymond, but I hate him. OK?). It was simpler.  Now, however, there are people I know from online to whom I have real-world attachments. Amd I'm not just talking about speaking to them on the phone or sending them packages through the real-world slow-ass snail mail. I'm talking about people whose lives I care about, who I think about not as sympathetic characters, but as friends. Conversely, things that make me mad "online" or people like VLP who are obviously just shit-spewers affect me in a way they wouldn't have previously. They aren't something I'm watching--they are part of my life.  Ultimately I think this is a good thing. I was never 100% comfortable with the role-playing version, and I like the opportunity the Internet affords us to build relationships beyond geographic contraints. I think it helps with making friends of a greater variety of ages, backgrounds, etc. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't come with a price, and the price, for me, has recently been sleepless nights and more immediately been the feeling of futility one experiences when one realizes she is yelling at a goddamn electrical box (which she herself bought, paid for, and put together, so she ought to know it's limited capacity for yelling back).

      Yay! Something good happened today!  I figured I really couldn't feel any worse, so I went ahead and did my taxes. I am getting a ton o' cash back, totally unexpectedly! I was expecting a few hundred in the best case scenario, and I'm actually going to get almost enough to pay my summer internship tuition. I hadn't thought about deducting my interest from student loan payments and current tuition, etc. Score one for me!  So anyway, yeah, something that doesn't totally suck happened, so I had to share.  In other news, I can now eat Saltines without puking. I think. Chocolate Teddy Grahams, on the other hand, definitely still make me hurl.

      1. Lay down and not be able to sleep--multiple hours 2. Give up and get up. 3. Try to get the Internet to work--1 hour. 4. Decide that Rice Chex are suitably bland and I can eat them--15 minutes. 5. Throw up. 6. Watch soap operas. 7. Throw up. 8. Finally get the Internet to work. 9. Wonder if it is humanly possible for me to throw up again.  That's pretty much where I am right now. How's your day?

      Bad has quickly made it's way to worse. I haven't slept yet, but it's not just insomnia. It's the goddamn stomach flu in all it's disgusting glory.  Yuck.  One of my coworkers and her 2 year-old son just got over it, so I should have known it was on its way. It came on really suddenly though, which is strange.  Back to bed.

      Some facts: 1. It is four-thirty in the morning. 2. I am awake. 3. I have been awake, more often than not, since I went to sleep, at about midnight. 4. One of my cuticles is bleeding.  I have insomnia. It's unpleasant. The little bit I did sleep was peppered with increasingly strange and violent dreams, however, so I guess this is a bit better than that.   It's bizarre the things you think about when you have insomnia. For instance, I have been fixated for several minutes (hours? I'm not quite sure.) on this book that was on my mom's shelf when I was a kid. She had this weird little section of "self-help" type books up in the top lefthand corner of the big bookshelf in the living room. Titles I remember include the ubiquitous  urlLink The Difficult Child . Anyway, this particular book had a blue cover and was called . urlLink I touch the earth, the earth touches me . I never knew what that book was about, thought it had an odd title, and wondered. It just occured to me that I'm an adult now, and I can find out what that book was about--read it, even--if I so desire.   Incidentally, did you know that you can make contributions to presidential campaigns using Amazon.com? That disturbs me, but I'm not quite sure why.   Some more things that have crossed my mind in the last minutes or hours: 1. I don't know what  Les Miserables  is about. I have no idea.  2. There is a line in a song from Hedwig that says, "decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit." I thought it was "blood, graffiti and shit" until I looked up the lyrics. 3. I've somehow lost the links section of my blog and I can't seem to get it back.   I feel the need to remedy #1 and #3 immediately, but I think I'm too brain-dead to try to do so.

      My evening class today was a mind-blow. It was three hours of sort of overstimulation of the empathetic system. Yes, I know the empathetic system is a figment of my imagination, but I don't really know how else to describe how I felt. First, we watched a short film about the  urlLink School of the Americas . School of the Americas is something I sort of knew about in the back of my head, where my long list of government attrocities is filed, but nothing I'd ever given too much thought or study to.  Jesus H. Christ. It should be unbelieavable, but sadly it isn't.  That segued into talk about human rights abuses worldwide, inequality, etc. etc. etc. All of that stuff that makes a nice, comfortable, happy liberal like myself feel really fucking guilty, and for good reason.   In the midst of my class notes, I jotted this down: Get out of your own head and start actually doing something. Walk the talk. Being indignant is not enough. Being outraged is not enough. There is so much that needs to be fixed, sitting here in your comfortable life and whining is NOT ENOUGH. Wake up!  Obviously not great prose, but you get the idea. I feel really strongly that I need to stop pretending that "caring" in some abstract way is enough while not being willing to make any sacrifices in my own life. I shop at Old Navy for God's sake! If that's not explicit support of the entire system of global repression of the poor, I don't know what is. There is just as much blood on my hands as on anyone else's and pretending that I believe that what I choose to do doesn't make a difference doesn't change that. I'm not fooling anyone, and I'm really not even fooling myself.  So.  What to do?  I'm going to start a list. Please feel free to add to it in the comments. I need all the help I can get. 1. Stop buying clothes and other items that I know good and goddamn well were manufactured in countries with unprotected work forces. There's no fucking excuse for me to be doing that. I have the time to find better places to spend my money. 2. Educate myself about what's going on worldwide. Stop being so American-centric with my interests and politics.  Actually, I am going to stop with just those two things, because if I can incorporate those into my life successfully, that will be a good first step, and overwelming myself with a whole big list will just give me an excuse to slack off about it.

      I kind of feel like shit about myself today. However, coming home from class this evening and opening my mailbox made everything a lot better. I got not one, but TWO gifts from friends in other states! How great is that? I don't think there is anything in the whole world quite as wonderful as getting a package with your name on it. It's not even necessarily about the contents of the package (although both of these packages contained quite wonderful self-pampering treats that I will certainly be making good use of), it is more about knowing that someone took time to think about you enough to not only acquire something to send to you, but also to send it. It's better than email, phone calls, anything, because you have some physical proof right there in your hands that someone cares about you. It's fucking wonderful, and it cheered my whole day. So huge thanks to both of my friends--your timing was impeccable.

      So I hate diet food. I really, really do. My trial of the  urlLink Skinny Cow  mint ice cream sandwich was a complete accident--I was in a hurry at the grocery store and didn't realize I was getting low-fat treats.  They are AMAZING. Seriously. They are as good or better than the full-fat variety, with a really reasonable number of calories and fat grams per. I am IN LOVE with them and have to spread the joy.  On the downside, they are spendy as hell ($4.50 for a package of six). But I hear you can sometimes get coupons on their website.

      Hello, I'm Grace and I'm an alcoholic.  Well, not really, but that's where I wanted to start, because what I am thinking about this morning is the words we use to identify ourselves. I'm very uncomfortable with AA for a ton of reasons, but one of those reasons is the sentance above--I don't like the idea of "an alcoholic" being the first term you use to identify yourself. In fact, I'm not sure I like terms used as identifying markers at all, especially when they get long and complex and they don't really fit.  I will take myself as an example. Here are some terms that could be used to identify me: -woman -female -feminist -bisexual -monogamous -dog-owner -non-mother -white -Oregonian -Texan -student -non-profit employee -Virgo -INTJ  The list could go on, but that's enough for now. When I look at this list of terms, though, it says absolutely NOTHING about me. These are just easy identifiers, words that people can make easy associations with--they aren't me. They certainly aren't when taken seperately, but even the whole list doesn't say a whole hell of a lot.  So why are people so damn attached to their identifying words? When we describe a friend to a third person, do we relate a story or something that reveals who the person really is to us? Usually not. Usually we say, "my friend X, who is a ____ from _____ and is married to _____ and has _____." We use easily definable characteristics--sometimes sexuality or nationality, sometimes physical characteristics, sometimes job status, sometimes things that are even more arbitrary. But do these signify anything real or true about the person we're describing? What about when we're describing ourselves? If I say I'm a 24 year-old student/non-profit employee, originally from Oregon but transplanted to Texas, who lives with my partner and my dog, that seems like it should give quite a bit of info, but does it really tell you anything?

      It's easy-peasy, as Jamie Oliver the cutie-boy says, so go for it: First mix up your salts. The kind you use really depends on what texture you are going for. I usually use about 1/2 espsom salts, 1/2 sea salt, and a good amount of baking soda. Mix all that together. Add a bit of vegetable glycerin (about a teaspoon for every two cups of salt, I think). You get get vegetable glycerin at a health food store, generally. Then add essential oils and colors of your choice. The color is the hardest part, because liquid color (I use food coloring, because I'm cheap, but you can get special soap colorant at a craft store) doesn't adhere very evenly to salt. The best thing to do, I think, is to mix and mix and mix and mix with your hands to get the color as evenly distributed as possible, and even then larger grains of salt are going to hold more color than smaller ones, so don't be too much of a perfectionist. Scent is really to your liking--I use a little 1/6 dram sample vial of a scent for about 4-6 cups of salts, but it depends on the flavor. You want the smell to be fairly strong when you are mixing it up, because otherwise you have to use too many salts at a time, and the smell seems to fade over time.  For containers, you can use whatever, but my current favorite are old glass containers from the Goodwill, particularly the heavy glass type with latching lids like folks keep coffee and stuff in.  I think I'm going to try sugar body scrub next, so I'll let you know how that goes.

      I really want another tattoo. I want it on my very upper arm--above the bicep. Like the arm part of my shoulder.  So I'm collecting ideas. And I'm going to post a few of them here to see what you think. Please let me know in the comments section (especially those of y'all who I know read but never comment!).    Just the balls, or the juggler and the balls. Can't decide. This is my favorite book in the world, even if it is Catholic.    I'd like some sort of Tree of Knowledge, and this is as close as I've found to what is in my head.    A classic.    Give peace a chance.  Another idea would be something from my dear Pablo:  Like this:    Or this:    Or this:    Or a bit simpler:    Or even this:   Although given the piece from Hedwig I have on my ankle, I don't know if I really want any more faces.

      As I've mentioned around 110 times before, I have had about 2000 pap smears in the past few years. At first it was because I was part of a research study and being paid $50 per appointment (I know most people wouldn't do it for that, but I was very broke at the time, and they didn't used to bother me). More recently, it's because I can't get conclusive test results to save my life, and I have at least three strains of HPV, one of which is considered "high-risk." So I have to keep an eye on things.  Anyway, I'm going for a follow-up pap today (last one was inconclusive) that I've been putting off since December. It makes me nervous. Not the test itself, but what the test might find. I am very educated about this--I know that even the worst case scenario simply isn't that bad--but that doesn't help me not freak out. Frankly, I don't want my cervix cut, burned, frozen, or electrosurgically fucked with, and I don't care how safe and easy it is.   But it beats the hell out of the alternative.  Anyway, the point was not to gross you out or give you TMI on my medical history. The point was to remind all readers that if it's been more than a year since your last pap smear, you should go get one. Gay, straight, bi, monogamous, not--it doesn't matter. It's a pain in the ass, but if I can submit to it four times a year or more, I'm positive you can live through an annual one.

      On today's edition of "what not to read with breakfast": A slew of emails from "progressive" men telling women how they should be dealing with sexism. My favorite bit? One man thinks that the thing standing in the way of putting institutional mechanisms in place to deal with sexism is APATHY.  Yep, you heard it here first, folks. I am not a victim of discrimination because I'm too ugly/pretty, tall/short, fat/thin, smart/dumb, or just because I'm too damn female. I'm a victim of sexist discrimination because I am APATHETIC!! If only I cared enough to do something about it, the world would surely change.

      I live in a supposedly liberal town and go to a supposedly liberal school (albeit in the middle of a decidedly non-liberal state). I came from another liberal town in a "left-leaning" state, and I went to undergrad at a school that put the "liberal" in liberal arts.   The one thing I am fairly sure about is that liberals are too goddamn conservative.

      (Title courtesy of Ani.)  **Warning: This post will most likely contain many, many curses.**  Wow. That was a collosal waste of time and increase in blood pressure. Fuck this place, anyway. It's impossible to even get folks here to agree that sexism  might  ben an itty-bitty problem, much less talk about actual solutions or real ways to move forward. We sat there for an hour and people talked about sensitivity, they talked about what life is like in the "real world," they talked about how it hurts  "learning moments" and conversation to use -isms. They talked about victimization and who has the responsibility to speak up. One woman (this has to be my favorite part) actually made some obviously very well thought-out claims about how men and women just think and communicate differently, and it's nobody's fault, we just need to learn to understand each other's styles.  They talked about just about everything except for the real problem. And I can't say I helped things much. I'm not comfortable here, I'm not going to get comfortable here, and honestly I find it really difficult to muster up much caring at all about what an old-boy's-club hellhole this place has really turned out to be. I'm just waiting, putting in my time, getting through my recs, and then I will get the hell out of here. Out into that mythical "real world" where I am assured things will be so much worse.  The next person who trys to talk to me about the real world as if I've never been a part of it is going to get a big smack in the face. I'm not even kidding. Could you be any more fucking condescending? I don't need you to tell me about the real world, Mr. Dean--let me tell you about my real world. In my real world, I have to put serious thought into what I wear to school or work every day, lest I be misjudged in my intentions due to my clothes. In my real world, I get to sit through disparagements of my gender, subtle and overt, multiple times a day. Every day. In my real world I can't walk outside alone at night, I drive with my doors locked, and I regularly have nightmares about being raped. To be more school-centered, my real world includes an impossible class schedule juggle to try to get classes with female professors. It includes having to find classes outside of my program that focus on gender because there are so few of them here. And above all, today, my real world is comprised of sitting fairly still, with a near smile, for over an hour while people surrounding me belittled what has been the only serious attempt I have seen here to deal with sexism. My real world sucks at the moment, thanks.

      In a few minutes, I am on my way to a town hall meeting to discuss sexism in the community in my school. I am quite sure that more than two but probably less than four people will have the nerve to say that they don't see sexism as a problem. And that may well be the easier part of the discussion. So stay tuned, I should be back to rant about how I hate my school and my species in about an hour and a half...

      Actually, it's not really all that beautiful--it's cloudy and I think it might rain. Still, I made a few observations about where I live while I was walking Chancey this morning, so I thought I'd share:   10 Things I Noticed on my Morning Walk  1. My neighborhood is full of very strange cats. These are large, fluffy cats who like to curl up into balls and sleep in the very center of a damp lawn. I have never seen cats behave this way before, both in terms of getting wet and in terms of being out in the open. And there are at least four of them along our route, all on different lawns. 2. There is one house that has two large vans and three full-size trucks parked in front of it/in the driveway at all times. How many people can possibly live there? 3. Same house as above still has their Christmas decorations up. Not just lights, either--it's a complete display, with Santa Claus. 4. There have got to be more birds here than anywhere else in the world. I'm not just talking about the plethora of  urlLink grackles , either. There are also a jillion  urlLink crows , a lot of very fat  urlLink pidgeons , and a bunch of other birds I can't identify. 5. The  urlLink mountain laurel  is almost done blooming and falling off. Which is too bad, it's very pretty, and it smells like artificial purple (think grape Kool-Aid). 6. Some people on the corner have a giant  urlLink prickly pear cactus . It stinks and attracts bugs. I had a very romantic view of cacti before I moved here. Now not so much. 7. We met the woman who walks the two French bulldogs in two different spots on our route today. I think she basically goes the same way we do, just in the opposite direction. Her little dog looks like  urlLink this , her larger one is brindle and looks more like  urlLink this . She's not terribly friendly. 8. Squirrels are mean little creatures. I like that about them. 9. There is a four-way stop on the major street we walk down, and I see someone run one of those stop signs nearly every morning. 10. The school in our neighborhood must start awfully early, because we walked by just before 8am (or maybe just after...) and all the kids were already inside.

      Things that are good about today: 1. Mark cleaned up the bathroom mold.  2. All of the household chores I wanted to get done are done. 3. I watched most of "A League of Their Own" on cable. 4. I made vanilla cake with strawberries and Cool Whip icing. Yum. 5. We took Chancey to three more new places, which means we CONQUERED the 12-new-places-in-14-days task. 6. Had an appt. with Lee that went well. 7. Got a ton of excercise. 8. Did laundry, so I now have clean socks AND clean sports bras.  All in all, it's been a very good and very productive Saturday. I'm quite tired and my calves are really sore (I walked for a total of about 2 hours yesterday and nearly that today, and yesterday it was in dress shoes), but I feel pretty good. Satiated. It's a good way to end a day.  I realized something odd about myself today. Or maybe it's not odd, it's just not something I've thought much about. I am really attracted to competence. People who are good at whatever it is they choose to do and are confident that they are good at it are a real turn-on to me. How did I realize this? When I caught myself being attracted to our dog trainer, who is at least 15 years older than me and probably 100 lbs or more overweight. He's got a really funny personality and stuff, too, but what it was that struck me was his competence and confidence. It's just so nice to see in people, and so rare. Most of us just go around with our heads down and hope nobody notices how we're muddling along.  Actually, my attraction to competence and confidence came up earlier in the week, too, now that I think about it. Mark getting his NSF grant was a huge turn-on. Which is odd. It makes sense that I'd be happy about it, as it is a huge honor for him and more money for us, blah blah blah. But I wasn't just happy--I found it oddly erotic that he won.   Interesting. I'll have to think about that. I'm not sure I want to be someone who likes winners simply because they won. I don't think that's really the case with Mark, though--I've seen firsthand how hard he's worked and how many times he's been disappointed. This isn't just about his being a winner, it's about overcoming.  And then there's me. I feel pretty confident right now, too. My presentation yesterday seemed to go fairly well, and it apparently had an impact on at least one member of the tiny audience, because she emailed me and wants to talk more about it. My interview went well. Basically, I feel good.  I still have hives, however. The Claritin is keeping them just-barely in check. I take it when I get up in the morning (it's 24-hour, supposedly) and by the next early morning they're back. And they never go totally away--I can still see them, especially on my stomach, they just don't itch. My other allergy symptoms are in high-gear as well--the Claritin doesn't seem to do a goddamn thing for them. It's frustrating.  I shouldn't complain, though. In a month or two it will be a million degrees here and nothing will be alive enough to be allergic to. At least right now everything is green and blooming and changing every day. If I could breathe, I'd actually really like being outside.

      I am home today, rather than at a "New Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies" conference that I really wanted to attend. Rather than at work. Why? Becuase I am presenting at same conference tomorrow, and I have not yet written my talk.  Am I writing my talk right now? No, I am not. I am staring at a blank screen, I am falling asleep, I am going to get something to eat, I am reading blogs, I am checking my email, but I am not writing my talk.  This is bad. In less than 24 hours, I have to have something to say. But my brain just isn't working and I want to go back to bed.  Fuck.

      I think it's time to seriously consider the possibility that God is smiting me.  I have hives. I have had hives, off and on, since late Monday night. My hives look more or less like  urlLink this . Right now, they are centered mostly on the backs of my knees, the small of my back, and my inner thighs. They itch like nothing I have ever experienced before (I don't get poison oak and I can't remember chicken pox, so that is perhaps not saying too much). I am afraid they are spreading to my hands again, as they did Monday night. If they do, I will surely kill myself.  Since I haven't eaten anything weird or rubbed anything weird on my skin, I'm not experiencing anaphalactic shock symptoms, and I'm not particularly stressed, the only reasoning I can think of behind this plague is smitten by God.  Whatever I did, I'M SO SORRY!!!

      Once again I am forced to justify bisexuality. Or not forced, really--it's just that I happened upon  urlLink Tiffany's  (See, I use actual names when I call people out, rather than woman-hating slang! You should try it some time, Tiffany!) little rant about my selfish, fake, cake-eating bisexuality. Yes, I know that responding is the last thing I should do, and maybe if Tiffany were the only one to feel that way I'd just let it go, but she's not and so I feel the need to try one more time to explain it.  The really funny part about what Tiffany wrote on her blog was the bit about "didn't your mother ever tell you that you can't have your cake and eat it too?" Strangely, she did. My mother also told me that she could totally understand being gay, but being bisexual is just "greedy." So it looks like mum is on your side for this one, Tiff. Good for you.  But being bisexual is not about being greedy. And it's not about double standards. And it's not about wanting to fuck women or objectify women "on the side" while remaining attached to what Tiffany so charmingly refers to as "the three-leggers." Being bisexual isn't about being confused, it's not about experimenting. It's not that much different than being heterosexual or homosexual, I wouldn't think. It's part what you choose and part the way you were born, or at least that's what it is for me. I believe I was born with the capacity to be attracted to people of either gender. I choose to embrace that capacity and not try to restrict my attraction to one gender or the other. When I was single, I chose not to restrict the possibility of getting into a relationship to those of one gender or another. And now that I am monogamously partnered with a man, I choose not to deny that I have silly little crushes on people of both genders. That's all there is to it. I could pretend that because I am in a relationship I'm never attracted to anyone outside of that relationship, but what would be the point of that? I would know I was lying, Mark would know I was lying, and things would feel secretive and dirty. I have absolutely no intention of acting on any attractions--I'm in a relationship, and being bisexual doesn't change how I feel about monogamy. But I get crushes on women as well as men.  And yes, I will even cop to getting more crushes on women than I do on men. And if I really look hard I can maybe even admit that could have something to do with my being culturally inundated with messages telling me women are beautiful and are to be looked at, etc. But I honestly don't think it's because I respect women or relationships between women less than I do men. Quite the contrary, actually--in many ways I am very sorry to have found the right man when I did, because I think I could find something totally different and in many ways "deeper" with a woman. But that's not what happened. I fell in love with a man, and that's that. Luck of the draw. I fell in love with a man--this particular man--even though I am probably more often attracted to women. Why is that so fucking hard to understand? I also fell in love with someone short even though I am usually attracted to tall folks--does that make me fake and greedy as well?  How would you like it if your every attraction was accused of being "trendy" or "greedy"? Why is my being attracted to men and women any  more greedy than your being attracted to only men or only women? Is there some magic number of attractions we are allotted per lifetime and I have already used mine up?

      I am having bad Chinese food for lunch again...  My crush got a very short (buzzed) haircut. We spoke about it briefly while she was taking my order. She said something about feeling the wind on her scalp. So cute.  Also, I don't think she's straight.

      So first I have to cop to my biases. I really like  urlLink Jim Carrey . I liked him a thousand years ago in the oh-so-silly  urlLink Ace Ventura: Pet Detective  (though  urlLink Courtney Cox  tried desperately to ruin it), I loved him later in  urlLink The Truman Show , and I really loved him as Andy Kaufman in  urlLink Man on the Moon . I have wisely avoided some of his probably less-impressive features ( urlLink The Majestic ?), and so I've been able to keep a pretty good ideal of him in mind.  Well, he fucking blew my mind in  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . Seriously. He's GREAT. He's understated, he's believable, he's likeable, and he's so...regular. Five minutes into the film I felt like his character, Joel, was someone I knew from college or something. It was wonderful. I suspected he had depth not only as a funny-ass comedian but as a real actor, and I was so so right.  Which brings me to the co-lead, urlLink Kate Winslet : My feelings about her have been mixed. She was in  urlLink Titanic . That's hard to forgive. However, I liked her in  urlLink Quills  (and yes, I very much liked  Quills --I've seen it three times--do I have to turn in my credentials now?), and I thought she made a great Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's  urlLink Hamlet . She was also good in  urlLink Iris , but she was frankly outclassed by  urlLink Judi Dench  (which is not saying much--I can think of few people who would not be outclasses by Judi Dench).  But in this film, Kate Winslet shines. She's wonderful. She's so alive, so radiant, and so fucked-up. She felt like someone I knew, too, only she was someone who I wasn't sure if I absolutely loved or couldn't stand. Her "impulsiveness", her multi-colored hair, her trying so hard...it was great.   So you take these two really wonderful characters, played by actors who really know their stuff, and you put them in this completely unlikely and bizarre plot about memory erasure. Sounds like the making of something horrible, right? But it works SO well. The film is dark in places--really dark, asking questions not only about love and relationships and all that jazz, but about the relationship we have with our own minds and how much agency we really have in making the same mistakes over and over again--and in places it's hysterical. And for something that makes you think so hard about your own life, your own relationships, your own memories, you come out of it feeling amazingly good about life. And I put that on the actors and the direction--the plot isn't necessarily hopeful.  Another really stunning thing about this film was the visual effects. The low-tech spotlighting and the slow erasure of details in memory scenes was not only really cool to watch, but also really gave you a sense of being in a memory. The camera work was a little bit dizzying, though--I wouldn't suggest going on an upset stomach.  Downsides? Supporting performances, definitely.  urlLink Kirsten Dunst  is just bad. Her character is annoying and seems out of place, and her acting goes from mediocre to really bad. I wasn't terribly impressed with  urlLink Elijah Wood , either, but honestly that could just be because I am so goddamn sick of seeing him everywhere.  urlLink Tom Wilkinson , however, is great as the doctor in charge of the memory erasing procedures. He's just mad scientist enough, without going over the top. I really enjoyed his part in the film.  One other thing I have to complain about is the small role played by  urlLink Jane Adams . I can't stand Jane Adams. And to be completely honest with you, it's because she bothered me so much in  urlLink The Anniversary Party  and I just can't get over it. That and she's way way too thin and I always get distracted from scenes she's in by marvelling at how thin she is.   All in all, it's a five-star movie and I'd highly recommend it. I know I'll be thinking about it for awhile.

      I have been meaning to write about this all week and am just now getting around to it. But it's worth the wait. Trust me.  On Monday, I accompanied S. to  urlLink Thundering Paws . The reason for our visit was both happy and sad: Sad because S. has been forced to give up her long time companion, fat cat Oscar, but happy because she'd found a santuary to give him to. Though he is 13 (I think?) years old and in excellent health (and weighs at least 20 lbs I swear), Oscar has a bit of a spraying and peeing all over problem. More than a bit, actually. He does it all the time, all over. S. and T. have valiantly been putting up with this for years now, but since Baby Rutabaga is on the way and will likely be crawling around and eating things off the floor, Oscar had to find a new home. So, after much trial and tribulation, S. found Thundering Paws. A perfect fit!  But what I wanted to write about was what a complete trip this place was. For starters, it is W-A-Y out in the middle of nowhere, with a bumpy dirt road to ford and the whole works. Secondly, it's a house.  Yes, a house. A manufactured home that has been built on to some, if I am remembering correctly. But a house nonetheless, and a fairly average sized one.   And there are 67 cats, 2 dogs, and 4 rabbits there, along with one very compassionate human woman who is dedicating her life to taking care of all of these creatures.  When we first pulled into the driveway, we knew this must be the place not because of the sign, but because there were at least 12 economy sized gallon buckets of kitty litter stacked up out front. That was a pretty good tip-off that we were in the right neck of the woods.   Walking into what would I guess be the living room of the house was like entering another world. There were some regular living room pieces there--a couch, a small TV--but mostly there were cats. I'd say about 20 cats. All shapes and sizes. All friendly, playing with each other and rubbing up against us for loving, lounging in corners and on boxes, walking lazily about like they owned the place (which they obviously do). It was amazing. In an adjacent room (what would I think be the dining room), there was a large mesh cage with four giant rabbits in it.  Communal litterboxes (made out of Rubbermaid containers with holes cleverly cut in the lids, so the kitties can get in and out and have privacy, but there isn't unsightly litter all over the place) and food and water bowls were scattered about, but in general the place was very clean. Or at least as clean as you could possibly expect a living space with about 30 cats (there were another 10 or so back in other rooms) in it to be. It smelled, but it smelled, as S. pointed out, like a vet's office, more than anything else.  Where are the rest of the kitties, you ask? Well, I'll tell you. They're outside.  See, the "build-on" to this place is a giant screened porched. And on that screened porch are probably 40 cats. Some are ferile. Some are cuddly. Some are declawed, some still have claws. And they all live there together, like an outdoor kitty commune. It is so damn cool. And again, relatively clean. They still use litter boxes out there, and have communal food bowls and stuff. And they flirt/spat with the dogs, who are outside dogs and come up to the screen and bother them. It's like a normal situation, times 70 or so!  There were two really amazing things about Thundering Paws. The first is that the woman who runs it knows all the cats names and personalities. Even though there were at least six black cats who looked exactly alike to me, she knew them all and talked to them all. The second is how well the cats get along. They seemed so harmonious, all living there together. It just seemed really natural.  Anyway, I wanted to give a shout out to Thundering Paws and the amazing woman who runs it (I wish I could remember her name, but it's probably better not to use it here anyway). I think Oscar will be very happy there.

      My friend  urlLink Adam  has a song that includes the lyric, "Bitterness becomes me, it makes me all aglow/I'm self actualized enough to go to concerts alone." I've thought that was fucking brilliant since I first heard it, since I myself am NOT self-actualized enough to go to concerts alone. Movies, either. I very much like to shop alone, but going to an actual event alone is generally beyond my self esteem.  Which brings me to my current conundrum: there is a concert tomorrow night I'd really really really like to see. It's  urlLink Kris Kristofferson . I've seen him once before, and it was amazing. He doesn't tour all that often, and I think he's a local here, so I'm really psyched about the idea of the show.  But...  I can't think of anyone to go with me. I can't think of anyone who would like him, and I hate to drag anyone along if they are going to miserable.  So I need to go alone, and see above about that.

      It has come to my attention that I haven't posted anything of any actual substance since Monday. So I am going to attempt to remedy that. My brain is feeling not-quite-here today, though, so don't expect too much.  I am currently working on fact sheets on different issues in children's health in the great state of Texas. Probably needless to say, children's health doesn't seem to be a big state priority, so creating these fact sheets, while interesting, is inevitably depressing. I really wish I could be drawn to work that was not depressing on a daily basis. It would be good for me, I think. But it's not going to happen.  Life seems to be getting a bit more complicated than I would like. Partially it's this job/internship thing. Yesterday, completely on a whim, I sent my resume to a half-time position I had just gotten a posting for. It would be a good job, pretty well paid, benefits, etc. I don't think I'm particulary qualified for it, but I hate to limit myself, so I sent in my resume. The woman to whom I sent it called to inquire about my interview availability literally less than ten minutes after I sent the email. What does that mean? Does that mean she's desperate? Does it mean I'm a good candidate even though I didn't think I was? Does it mean I misrepresented myself in my email?  And why can't any of the other things I have applied for get back to me...? What's taking so long?  Nag nag nag.  Also, I need to go to the doctor. In fact, I'd say I  really  need to go to the doctor. I think there is something wrong with my anti-depressant prescription, I'm getting more migraines, blah blah blah. So why haven't I made an appointment yet? Well, because I'm scared, frankly. I'm terrified of doctors and it takes me weeks of building up to make an appointment.  To make matters worse, I now know which strains of HPV I have. The research study I was in finally ended, so they un-blinded the results. And yes, one of the strains I have is a cancer-causing strain. So I really need to go for a repeat Pap. But have I made an appointment to do that? Fuck no--again with the fear of doctors.  So yeah...that's where I am today. Perhaps it was better when I was just posting recycled song lyrics and pictures, huh?

      I just listened to this for the first time in a month or so, and I was once again floored. So I had to share:   When the earth was still flat, And the clouds made of fire, And mountains stretched up to the sky, Sometimes higher, Folks roamed the earth Like big rolling kegs. They had two sets of arms. They had two sets of legs. They had two faces peering Out of one giant head So they could watch all around them As they talked; while they read. And they never knew nothing of love. It was before the origin of love.  The origin of love  And there were three sexes then, One that looked like two men Glued up back to back, Called the children of the sun. And similar in shape and girth Were the children of the earth. They looked like two girls Rolled up in one. And the children of the moon Were like a fork shoved on a spoon. They were part sun, part earth Part daughter, part son.  The origin of love  Now the gods grew quite scared Of our strength and defiance And Thor said, "I'm gonna kill them all With my hammer, Like I killed the giants." And Zeus said, "No, You better let me Use my lightening, like scissors, Like I cut the legs off the whales And dinosaurs into lizards." Then he grabbed up some bolts And he let out a laugh, Said, "I'll split them right down the middle. Gonna cut them right up in half." And then storm clouds gathered above Into great balls of fire  And then fire shot down From the sky in bolts Like shining blades Of a knife. And it ripped Right through the flesh Of the children of the sun And the moon And the earth. And some Indian god Sewed the wound up into a hole, Pulled it round to our belly To remind us of the price we pay. And Osiris and the gods of the Nile Gathered up a big storm To blow a hurricane, To scatter us away, In a flood of wind and rain, And a sea of tidal waves, To wash us all away, And if we don't behave They'll cut us down again And we'll be hopping round on one foot And looking through one eye.  Last time I saw you We had just split in two. You were looking at me. I was looking at you. You had a way so familiar, But I could not recognize, Cause you had blood on your face; I had blood in my eyes. But I could swear by your expression That the pain down in your soul Was the same as the one down in mine.  That's the pain, Cuts a straight line Down through the heart; We called it love. So we wrapped our arms around each other, Trying to shove ourselves back together. We were making love, Making love. It was a cold dark evening, Such a long time ago, When by the mighty hand of Jove, It was the sad story How we became Lonely two-legged creatures, It's the story of The origin of love. That's the origin of love.  -Stephen Trask

      When I first started reading the Ms. Magazine message boards (three years ago? Four?), it was with a mixture of awe and disgust. Some of what I saw going on there was amazing, awe-inspiring—it was online feminism, women connecting with one another with no regard for the boundaries of race or age or nationality or physical proximity. It was wonderful. Usually, the disgust followed the awe pretty closely, though, because the nasty undercurrent was there from the beginning. However, I was so enraptured by what I was seeing that my initial skepticism wore off and after awhile I felt like a real member of the community. I put my shyness and feelings of inadequacy aside and I jumped in and started posting.  I was an active member there for two and a half years, and much as I hate to say this, much as I know it makes me sound like a Republican pundit on TV talking about the decline of family values in America, I watched it decline. What had been a pervasive but generally ignorable undertone of racism, misogyny, and joy in the pain of other women when I started out became something much darker, and it clouded the waters over and over again. Every time there was clarity or a brief reprieve, I hoped that my community was on the way back up, and every time I was disappointed.  I could spend thousands and thousands of words giving examples of the horrible things that went down at Ms., but I’ll limit myself for your sake as well as my own. Basically, a small group of women calling themselves “radical feminists” made their presence known in nearly every thread, and they made it known in the most hurtful and vile of ways possible. There are only half a dozen to a dozen of these women there, but they have for years now spewed hatred with a consistency and determination that would be laudable if it were dedicated to actual feminist activity. Lowlights include various racist and anti-Semitic comments, horrible class bias, and intolerance bordering on hatred of women with non-lesbian sexualities, but the worst thing was always the general nastiness pointed towards posters who had been deemed “non-radical” and apparently not fit for human form. Examples of this include telling a board member the world would be better of if she committed suicide, referring to mothers on the board as “breeders” and worse, questioning not only the feminism, but the humanity of nearly every post some of us made for months. There is no way I can count the number of times one of the few women in this destructive pod wrote something to me that had me in tears, and I don’t cry easily. And I am not alone, either. I am one among dozens of women who were routinely abused in exactly this fashion in what they had come to depend upon as their community online.  After months of attempting to fight this and seeing more and more of the posters I really respected wisely jump from the boards like they were a sinking ship, in October of last year I finally gave up, left, and started The Phoenix. The Phoenix has been wonderful for these past months, providing me and a lot of other women with a safe feminist space. It doesn’t and probably never will have half the traffic Ms. did, so it suffers from a greater skewing in age, race, nationality, etc. that I regret and want to try to fix, but the environment there is almost wholly positive and I am proud to have created it.  Since I left, things at Ms. seem only to have gotten worse. I have lurked there from time to time but haven’t posted much if it all. The moderation was always spotty—sometimes there daily, sometimes no presence for weeks, etc.—but it seems to have worsened considerably, including the bannings of some wonderful long-time posters for infractions that were retaliatory, at worst. Having lost contact with some of these women, I truly hope that they have found better communities elsewhere. The moderators have also persistently refused to hear complaints about the core group of so-called “radical feminists” who have caused all of these problems.    Recently, the situation escalated in a way I wouldn’t have thought possible. A long-time board poster committed suicide, and board members turned this tragedy into one more excuse for in-fighting, back-stabbing and brutality towards one another. My level of disgust now is as high as it was when I left, even after having six months to cool down. This is NOT a feminist space. It is quite simply a catfight. If the patriarchy had planned it themselves they couldn’t have done it any better—it’s women as women’s worst enemy, and when we’re all busy destroying each other, who is left to destroy them?  For these past months, I’ve had this back-of-my-mind hope that the place would return to the “mostly-good” state in which I found it years ago, and that all of us who abandoned ship could go back and rebuild it. But that’s not going to happen. What could be a locus of hope, communication, strength, activism and friendship for women from all walks of life, worldwide, is nothing more than a mud pit, where women go to beat up on each other, sling filth at one another, and generally participate in the destruction of their own sex, all for the pleasure of what I really hope is an imaginary audience. But what if it’s not? These boards are open, and the women there are happy to give any lurkers all the inside help they need in defeating a feminist movement that still—perhaps now more than ever—desperately needs all of our strength.  This is the part where I’m supposed to say what I have learned from all this and how it’s made me a better person, but I’m honestly not sure it has. Because of the creation of The Phoenix, and because of the excellent friends I’ve made through Ms., I do feel as if something good has come out of it, but as far as my growth as a feminist, I suspect my participation there has been counterproductive. I used to trust other women more than I do now. I used to like other women more than I do now. And I want my old self back.

      Again. This is getting old. Last night is was no sleep because of the migraine, and now this? I slept for about three hours or so before I woke up, and now it seems I am just awake, and have been for at least an hour and a half.  This is so irritating.  And of course I'm not cognizant enough to write anything worth reading...

      Last night I had a migraine. This isn't exactly unusual, but this was the worst one I've had in some time, and it didn't go away and let me sleep until about 5 or 6am (I went to bed with it at about 12:30). It was fucking nasty. Anyway, I was thinking this morning about the dynamic of having a migraine. There is something so lonely about it--it's just you and your pain, and nobody can help you. In fact, interaction from the outside, no matter how well-meaning, inevitably makes things worse. It's very strange to think that I laid there, awake, for more than 5 hours. It seems like it was both less and more time than that. The pain is so all-consuming that you don't get bored and in some ways time goes fast, but every minute is so torturous that times goes very slowly at the same time.  In better news, this morning is T's birthday brunch. I'm feeling pretty wrung out from my night, but I'm excited anyway, and my excitement was compounded when I put on a pair of pants that haven't fit for about a year and they look great. The numbers on the scale aren't going down anymore (and are in fact going up in the past few days), but my clothes are telling a different story, which is nice.  Mark and I had a strange discussion last night about what would happen if I got pregnant. Given the length of time I've been on the pill and the clocklike accuracy with which I take it, I don't think either one of us is particularly worried this will happen, but it's always a good discussion to revisit every now and again, just in case. When we've had it before, we've always agreed that, tough as it would be, aborting would be the only answer. Now, however, we're not so sure. We know that unideal as it would be, we  could  have a baby now. Financially it would be tough, it would mean a lot of sacrifice, etc., but it would be possible. What a very strange transition that is. I still don't want to have a baby now, or any time in the near future, but it's odd to think that I could, and it wouldn't even be all that strange. I wouldn't really be a young mom anymore. It wouldn't really be all that "irresponsible" of us to decide to have a kid. Very fucking strange.  We finally saw  urlLink Finding Nemo  last night. To be honest, I was underimpressed. It was cute, and the animation was very cool, but I was expecting something transendental with all of the good stuff I'd heard about it, so I ended up a bit disappointed. Susan and Tony and I also saw  urlLink The Fog of War  on Friday night, and I should probably review that here, since I definitely think it was worth watching, but do have some problems with it. I just don't seem to have the energy to write an actual review, though.

      I had a frighteningly realistic dream last night about my future son, Liam. He was blonde and brown eyed, and he looked more like Mark than like me. He was about a year old, barely toddling, not really talking, learning so fast I couldn't keep up. He was playing with the dog, playing with Mark, nursing...I woke up crying. I spent all morning thinking about whether or not we could pull off a baby right now.  We can't, of course, and I don't think I'd even want to if we could. But where does this fucking feeling come from, then?

      My friend Susan calls this "feeling purple." It's as good a description as any I've heard. I'm feeling purple today. Makes me think I'm feeling bruised, which I am. Makes me think I'm feeling like my head it wrapped in purple velvet and I can't see or hear clearly, which is certainly the case. I like it. It's descriptive.

      I'm checking lots of stuff off my to-do list this morning. So far I've reorganized drawers and closet for the season change, hauled two big bags of old clothes to the Goodwill, gone to the car wash and gone to the pet supply store for non-wheat doggie treats. Now I'm settling in for some Internet time and lunch, and then off to class.  I like it when I feel energetic and productive and can actually accomplish things on my mornings off, rather than crawling back into bed. It's good stuff.

      I am bopping back and forth between message boards this morning, though I really should be doing something a bit more productive with my time (and really, any use of my time, including sleeping or replacing the grout in my shower, would probably be more productive). And the same thought keeps crossing my mind: why are people such  assholes ? There has been some relatively heavy shit in message board land these past few days (someone I didn't know/don't remember having been around apparently killed herself), and people's reactions to it, on multiple sides/multiple boards, are fucking appalling! It's like it's nothing more than today's excuse for attacks.  You know how there is often that one person that you just don't fucking like, even though you try to like them or see the good in them or whatever? Well that person has been on my last nerve for a long damn time now, and I'm just about fed up with the whole thing. I don't like his friends, I don't like his enemies, but most of all I just don't like him. So there. Why is it so hard for me to admit it when I just don't fucking like someone, end of story? It isn't a misunderstanding, we're not in a fight,  you're just an asshole!    This is both a rant and a ramble, so I'm going to sign off now and go try to find something more productive to occupy my time. Perhaps I will do the dishes and the laundry for the man I live with, cuz I'm oppressed like that.   Blah.

      I feel like absolute ass. I didn't feel well last night--just achey and tired and grouchy and not quite right. But I work up this morning in pain. All my joints hurt. My back is killing me. My HAIR hurts. I feel feverish. I really really want to get back in bed.  So I can only assume I am doing what I do best--getting sick. Why is it that I have a 90 year-old immune system in a 24 year-old body? I honestly don't get it.  My macro midterm is this morning. I can't stay home. So I'm all wrapped in my new fuzzy yoga pants and my fuzziest hoodie and I'm going to campus. I'll do the best I can on the test, then come back and go back to bed.  Please let this be brief.

      I realized today, suddenly, that I am trying to do much too much at once and I am in danger of failing at all my goals due to spreading myself too thin. Here are things I am working on: 1. Diet, exercise, weight loss 2. Stopping nail biting 3. Stopping recreational shopping 4. Finding spirituality  And that is on top of a pretty stressful work and school schedule, and this whole thing about the internship. So I've really been feeling like a failure, as if I'm doing everything half-assed and not suceeding at anything.  So it's time for a new plan. Refocus. I am going to keep working on my spirituality. I am not going to worry about my shopping for the time being, other than to try to keep it generally in check. I'm going to focus on excercise and worry less about caloric intake. I'm going to try to be patient and see where the chips are going to fall in terms of the internship.  Does that make sense, or am I copping out? I feel like I've totally lost perspective...

      So I am awash in questions and contradictions having to do with my summer internship. As I think I've mentioned, I declined the position in Oregon. Spending the summer away just didn't feel right, and I think that was the right decision.  But now...well, I'm second and third and fifteenth guessing myself. I have a sure thing--an offer of a decent-paying position at the non-profit where I currently work. Upsides: it's stable, I love my coworker, I know what I'm getting into. Downsides: I don't really think I want to do non-profit work long-term, I'm not sure the boss likes me and I'm not sure I like her (but I'm not sure I don't, either), I'm not totally sure what I'd be doing, there doesn't seem to be anywhere to advance to within the organization (and I don't think I'd want to stay there after I graduate anyway).  And then there are the plethora of other things I am applying to, but I have nothing yet (not even an interview) and I can't count on being offered anything. There's a legislative aid position, a position with the Dept. of Insurance that would last through next year and culminate in my professional report, a position with the state council on local governments, a position with a state women's organization...these all carry different levels of pay, etc., but I think they'd each be financially doable.  Ag! I don't want to give up my sure thing, but I feel like I owe it to the org. where I am currently working to tell them sooner, rather than later, if I'm not planning on working there over the summer. I'm afraid of burning bridges, but I'm also afraid of taking the "easy way out" (i.e. the sure thing).  Suggestions? Comments? I'm stumped.

      I found out today that my abstract on HPV and cervical cancer in lesbian women has been accepted to the  urlLink Working Together to Create Healthy Lives 2004  lesbian health conference in Chicago. I'm so excited! Huge thanks to  urlLink Frog , who made this opportunity known to me in the first place.  So, between now and May, I've got to get my shit together. Actually, I have to do it before that, because I have a trial run presenting the same paper at a UT conference in late March. Basically, I'm talking about HPV as an example of a health risk that lesbians are very often misinformed about (by their doctors, no less) and how this is one example of the necessity for lesbian-sensitive health care policy in this country. Anybody want to read and critique? Next week is Spring Break, so I plan to do most of the work then.  Also, I have to figure out logistics. This conference coincides very nicely with a trip I was already planning to make to that neck of the woods (to visit both online and RL friends), so that's cool, I just have to figure out how to shuttle myself back and forth between the three relevant cities in question.   Ah! I'm so excited!

      Over the course of the past three days, a search for "smithie girls" or "Smithie Girls" has led five or six seperate people to my blog. Is there something I should know about that?

      I think I've hit the diet-and-excercise plateau. I've been working on it for three months, and I'm just completely sick and fucking tired of watching what I eat, of keeping track of what I eat and how many calories and what I weigh and what excercise I'm doing. I'm sick to death of exercise. I just want to eat what I want and do what I want. I'm discouraged.  And it's been working--I'm more than halfway to my goal. But I haven't changed weight at all in about two weeks, so that might be part of it. Part of it, though, is my tendancy to want to call it good enough and quit now. And if I did that, I know, I'd be back where I started in just a few months.  I need...inspiration. Why should I keep going? Why am I doing this again?

      I don't feel capable of thought this morning, much less composition, but here I am anyway. I'm seriously considering going back to bed. I have plenty to do--house to clean, economics midterm to study for, work to do. I'm supposed to be working from home today, but I can't concentrate. I have an interview at 3pm today that I should be preparing for, but I can't concentrate. The only thing I can think of to pontificate upon here is how very sick I am of multigrain hot cereal for breakfast, and that's not even interesting to me.  So...looks like I am probably going to be wasting this particular Friday, or at least the morning portion of it. Great.

      Once upon a time, a million years ago, I lived  urlLink here .  As you can see, it's a wee bit institutional. It is also in a very rainy climate. Due to the combo of institutional-building-with-a-rubber-floor and constant wet feet, the stairwells had a very specific wet-rubber smell that I've never associated with any other place.  I just went downstairs in the office building where I work to get a snack from the vending machine. It's pouring outside. We have rubber stairs like MacNaughton did. I smelled that smell.  And I'm right back there, worried about my first Humanities paper, drinking to the point of getting sick, making late-night trips to Denny's or calls for pizza and sleeping only during daylight hours.  Yeah, I miss it.

       Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart among the rags and the bones and the dirt. There's piles of lies, the love gone from her eyes, and old moving boxes full of hurt. Pull up a chair by the trouble and care. I got whiskey, you're welcome to some. Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart, but I don't reckon you're gonna come.  I've tried to fix up the place, I know it's a disgrace, you get used to it after a while - with the flood and the drought and old pals hanging out with their IOU's and their smiles. bare naked women keep coming in and they dance like you wouldn't believe. Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart, so take a good look - and then leave.  Oh Lord, why does the Fall get colder each year? Lord, why can't I learn to love? Lord, if you made me, it's easy to see that you all make mistakes up above. But if I open the door, you will know I'm poor and my secrets are all that I own. Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart and I hope that you leave it alone.  -Greg Brown  Yup.

      I am having one of those annoying days where I really want to write something here, but I have fuck-all to say. I have to leave for a meeting and then 4.5 hours of class in a bit, and I think I'll probably have fuck-all to say there, as well. I did the reading and everything, but I just feel brain dead.  I wish I could figure out why I am tired all the time. Seriously, it's like the plague. No matter how much or how little sleep I get, no matter if I do or do not nap, no matter if I eat good food or eat crap, no matter if I exercise or not, I am tired almost all the time. I've searched high and low for a biological cause for this (hypothyroid, PCOS, chronic fatigue, something) and haven't found one. Then I thought it was just a depression manifestation, but I don't think it is, because it seems to happen even when I'm not feeling at all depressed. It slacks off for a little while now and again, but it always comes back. It's very frustrating.

      I am an agnostic. Agnostic, according to  urlLink dictionary.com , is a noun meaning: 1. a. One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God.      b. One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism.  2. One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something.   I'd say I fit strongly into 1a and 2, and 1b really depends on the day. I used to describe myself as an "I-don't-care-agnostic," or someone who not only doesn't know whether or not there is a God, but doesn't particularly care, either.  But that is so, so far from true.  There are few things in this world I want as badly as I want to believe in God. And I don't just want to believe in some god, I want to believe in one with a religion already set up. I want the ritual, the community. Most of all, though, I want to experience faith. And I really try. I am, and have been for several years now, looking for God.  What I mean by looking for God is this--every time I see or hear of something I find truly amazing, I wonder if that was supposed to be my sign that yes, there really is a higher power, and I was just too stupid to recognize it? But then I second-guess myself, thinking that if I really had an epiphany, there'd be no question about whether or not that was the sign. It's like love, right? If you have to ask yourself whether you are in love or not, then you're not? Something like that.  And so I haven't found God. I've had people try to show God to me, though not in anything but the worst possible ways and never from anyone I actually respect. And I've tried not to look before, too, but now that I am looking, I want to know where the hell God is hiding?  This has the potential to disintegrate into serious rambles, so perhaps I should cut it short. This is a subject I've really been wrestling with lately, so I'll probably come back to it at some point.

      I just made the best gingersnaps I've ever had. I already ate 1/2 dozen of them and they aren't even finished baking yet. So I have to post the recipe. It's "Grandma's Gingersnap Cookies," posted at  urlLink All Recipes  by Marie Ayers. I just made a few changes:  Ingredients: 2 cups sifted flour 1 tbsp ground ginger (I used about 1 1/2 tbsps) 2 tsps baking soda 1 tsp ground cinnamon (I used about 2 1/2 tsps) 1/2 tsp salt 3/4 cup shortening  1 egg 1/4 cup dark molasses (I used mild, because it's what I have, and I used a bit more than 1/4 cup) 1/3 cup cinnamon sugar (I mixed this one-to-one, but I really love cinnamon)  1. Preheat oven to 350 2. Mix and sift the first five ingredients. Sift a second time and place the mixture back in the sifter. I think this double-sifting is important, because these have a really great tender crumb. 3. Beat the shortening until creamy. Add the 1 cup sugar gradually and continue beating. Beat in egg and molasses. 4. Sift the flour mixture in about 1/3 at a time, stirring after each. I switched to a wooden spoon here, because I am sad and do not have a real mixer. 5. Roll the dough into tiny balls, roll the balls in cinnamon sugar, put on a parchment covered cookie sheet. I think the tinyness is important here. I did mine small enough to get 5 dozen from this recipe. For some reason they are better smaller. 6. Cook. The recipe says it takes 10 minutes, I think it takes about 7. Tops are rounded and slightly cracked when when they're done. Cool on a wire rack.  These are spicy, so enjoy with good cold milk.   Yummy!

      Mom sent another email. Apparently Agnes told her nurses on Friday that she didn't want to eat, she just wants to die, but has since lost lucidity enough that she doesn't remember saying that or feeling that way and she isn't arguing with being fed now. It sounds pretty bad. Mom doesn't seem to think she's got too long.  I sent a card and picture last week. I'm not sure what else to do now.

      As is so often the case, Dar is speaking to me today:   Sometimes I see myself fine, sometimes I need a witness  And I like the whole truth  But there are nights I only need forgiveness  Sometimes they say "I don't know who you are  But let me walk with you some"  And I say "I am alone, that's all  You can't save me from all the wrong I've done."  But they're waiting just the same  With their flashlights and their semaphores  And I'll act like I have faith and like that faith never ends  But I really just have friends   -Dar Williams

      As I mentioned last week, I am abstaining from any sort of recreational shopping during Lent.  I'm also trying to lose weight, through both healthier diet and daily excercise. This effort is about three months old now. So far it's successful, I've lost 12 lbs and I feel a lot better.   I'm also trying to stop biting my nails. This effort is about a month old. So far it is also successful, my nails are grown out and they look great.  All three of these things take a lot of self-discipline. Self-discipline is not and has never been my strong point. When it really comes down to it, I'm basically an extremely self-indulgent person. I don't just mean as self-indulgent as would be natural for a white, middle-class American (although you'd think that would be self induglent enough!). No, I'd say I'm particularly self-indulgent. I'd say I'm self-indulgent to a very large fault. I have always been really bad at denying myself anything, and every time I do something even minorly good, I feel as if I deserve a reward.  This is where I'm running into a problem right now. I am sort of at a loss as to my reward system. I can't reward myself for not shopping with food, I can't reward myself for not biting my nails with buying something, etc. I keep telling myself that virtue is its own reward, but my self-indulgent brain just isn't getting it.  And this, of course, makes me feel really shitty about myself, which takes most of the joy out of the fact that I am actually successful, so far, in all three of my goals. And feeling shitty just makes me want to scrap the whole plan, write that I'm not Catholic anyway and if God is going to smite me, it's already gonna happen, and head to Target to buy some cheap shiny plastic shit.  Which would, I'm certain, make me feel even worse, probably setting off a cookie-eating and nail-biting binge. And then I'd be right back where my self-indulgent little ass started.  So...what to do? I'm trying to develop a plan, a reward system that has nothing to do with eating or shopping. So far I'm coming up empty handed. It seems that, like a good American, joy for me is all wrapped up in consumption.  Yuck.

      My elation is wearing into exhaustion at this point, but nothing has ever been so worth it.  I think the March for Women's Lives may well have been the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Right up there, anyway. I'm trying to decide where it falls on the continuum, and it's definitely in the first-Ani-concert/Renn Faire (which is NOT a Renaissance Faire) area. A million people (or 800,000, or whomever's estimate you want to believe), most of them women, marching on the capitol to demand what is rightfully ours. All smiling, singing, shouting, waiving signs and flags. I can't imagine another time when I will be able to see so much beauty and so much hope in one place.  It really reminded me of a part of my politics (and my life, really) that has gotten away from me lately--hope. One of the pre-march speakers used that Che quote about optimism being the weapon of the revolution, and I remembered how I used to believe that. And then, looking around me, I really felt like it was true again. We may be under the harshest regime this country has seen in decades, atrocities might be committed falsely in our names both at home and abroad, but we are not cowering and we will not give up.  I really am exhausted, and in theory I am supposed to perform some odd ritual known as "homework" tonight, so I'm going to leave this here. More reflections tomorrow, hopefully. To close, though, to my sisters who are reading this and weren't able to make it to the march yesterday, your presence was felt. I know I thought of you often. And to my sisters who were, thank you for marching with me.

      One of the things I really love about having a blog is that when I get into a discussion about something that hits close to home elsewhere online, I can take it back to my blog and write it out for myself, without having to worry about following a discussion or answering questions that are throw at me or anything. This is my space, so I can write just what I'm thinking about it, even if others don't think that's the important part. Ultimately, I'm still responsible for what I write, of course, but I can at least do it on my terms and my timeline.  So that's good.  I read a lot of parenting blogs these days. I'm not sure how that happened exactly, as parenting isn't exactly a burning issue of mine, but I welcome it. One can never be too prepared, and the parents I read are an insightful bunch with superb writing skills. One thing I have noticed about the parenting blogs I read is that nobody hits their kids. I'm really, really happy to see that.   I think part of it is generational. People spank a lot less now than they did 20 years ago when I was a wee one, and probably less than than 20 years before, if my mum's stories are any indication. To me, that's progress.   Obviously some cases of child abuse are so egregious it's hard to see them as anything but a specific abuser's fault. That's not the way I see common spanking, though. It took me quite a while to come to this position, but I really see it as a societal thing. I've never seen my mother raise her hand to another adult, to an animal, etc. She's just not a violent person. Yet she broke wooden spoons on my ass with regularity before I was old enough to defend myself. Where does that come from? It's very difficult for me to think that's it is something within her. Rather, I think it's societal--she did what was expected of her. In that way, it's much like circumcision, which is another topic we've been discussing on The Phoenix. I don't blame moms who have their sons circumcised, even though I personally do believe it's multilation. I don't think they are personally responsible, though, because nobody knows how to parent magically, and lots of times you just muddle along and do what is expected. When and where I grew up, spanking was expected. In the U.S., circumcision is expected.  Not that I want either of these practices to continue just because they are normal. Far from it. But I don't think individual blame pointed towards the women who spank their kids or have them circumcised is a good conduit for change. It's better, I think, to shift our efforts towards parental education. I don't believe my mom would have hit us if she would have thought she had another choice. And it wasn't her fault she didn't know.

      I am sick. I have been sick all week. I run a fever, I throw up, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I hurt all over, I'm dizzy, you name it. And it's been like this since Monday, with the exception of Wednesday, when I was totally fine and thought I was over it.  In 24 hours I am getting on a plane to D.C. I really, really need to not be sick while I'm there. Five days should be enough, don't you think?  Good thought appreciated.

      For no reason other than it will make me feel better, I am going to subject you, faithful blog reader, to a rundown of everything I have to do in the next three weeks: this Saturday-Monday: go to D.C. this Monday (magically, while I am on a plane from D.C. to Dallas): register for next fall's classes also on Monday, miss a class Tuesday, 4/27: My best friend's birthday, but I'll probably forget, due to the fact that I have three hours of macro, which I need to read SIX chapters for sometime between now and then. Then I have a break, then I have four hours of my intersexuality class. For the intersexuality class, I have a written critique of someone else's paper due. Oh, yeah, and an article to read. Wednesday, 4/28: Just class, blessedly. I have about a book and a half to read for class before then, though (I'm telling myself I'll do it on the plane). Monday, 5/4: Final draft of my 30+ page medical alienation and intersexuality paper due. Tuesday, 5/5: 10 page paper detailing my "field work" due for my journalism class. Monday, 5/10: 30 page final research paper on media coverage of rape in the military due for my journalism class Wednesday, 5/12: Management final Thursday, 5/13: 15 page management case study due. Friday, 5/14: Macro final. Then collapse, then get up a write a talk that I have to give in Chicago on Thursday, 5/20. Then be on blessed vacation for a few days.  Funny. Writing that out made it absolutely no better.

      It has come to my attention that my blogging lately sucks. It sucks a lot. I only post memes or short, stupid rambles about my personal mental state. I can't remember the last time I wrote something interesting.  Truth be told, I am suffering from blog impotence, triggered by my inadequacy complex. Over there on the left you will see a list of blogs that are nearly all better than mine. Some of them are miles and miles better than mine. The more I read them, the more I wonder why anyone would bother to read this, the less interesting stuff I can think of to write.  So yeah. That's the big reason for my prolonged (well, prolonged for me, anyway) silence.   In an effort to update--I read Joseph Stiglitz's  urlLink Globalization and its Discontents  this weekend. It's worth reading. Yesterday, when I was home feverish and throwing up, I watched  urlLink The Life of David Gale . It is worth watching, and it gave me an inexplicable crush on  urlLink Kevin Spacey . One of my senior year prospies at Reed had a producer daddy and was a family friend of Spacey's, or so she claimed (and I vaguely remember checking out her story and having it stack up--her dad worked on  urlLink Swimming with Sharks , I think). Anyway, she told me Kevin Spacey is definitely gay. Makes me sad that he's not out. But he was hot in David Gale anyway, in a philosophy professor kind of way.  What else...? Saw  urlLink Kill Bill Vol. 2  over the weekend. Actually, S. and T. and I went with some of their friends, to a double-feature of the first and second volumes. It was a good time. I love the  urlLink Alamo Drafthouse .   Do you ever think that maybe I put in lots of links in a effort to hide my lack of content? I do.

      I haven't been posting anything of substance here lately, as some of you have noticed. There is really one simple reason: The Man is getting me down. I don't know what it is precisely, or more I can't put a neat label on the combination of things it is, but I'm wearing a little bit thin. School is overwhelming me, which makes me feel lame. I'm exhausted all the time, which is probably just from allergies, but it still makes me feel lame. Work is...gray. It's fine, but I feel guilty for being here when I have so much school shit to do (and of course I feel guilty for not being here when I'm at home). I'm tired of doing all the freaking housework. I'm tired of exercising and trying to eat well. I'm incredibly tired of bleeding and of the pain that comes with it every. freaking. month. Mostly I'm just tired.  So yeah. I'm in a funk. If I snap at you, I apologize in advance. I'm trying not to be a pain, even though I feel like being one all the time.

      Dear Self,  When you  massively bomb a test, you feel bad about yourself. Coming home, snarfing down four frosted sugar cookies, napping for two hours, snarfing down three more cookies, then going shopping DOES NOT make you feel better. In fact, it invariably makes things worse. Take that into consideration upon your next test bombing.  Love,  Grace

      First, for  urlLink Frog , a  urlLink trackback tutorial . It makes sense to me, but you don't have your trackback set-up, so I can't try it.  Now, from Frog:   [Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says]   "its repression, from the end of February to April 1991; and the Kurdish..."   [Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?]  The wall. Ow.   [What is the last thing you watched on TV?]  The very end of "Dogs with Jobs."

[Did you dream last night?]  Probably, but I don't remember.   [When did you last laugh?]  Just 30 seconds or so ago when Mark came in here and said, "Your online time is taking up too much of your life and I feel like I'm being excluded!" (He was kidding.)

      For reasons to varied and probably not interesting enough to go into here, it seems that I have come to a decision on the summer job/internship front. I'm going to stay where I am. It's good to have that settled.  Well, almost settled, anyway. I have to wait until someone with some authority comes in so I can make sure I still have a job here, then it will be settled.  In other news, I feel...frustrated, I guess. This week has just been such a wash so far, and I'm falling back into habits I tried so hard to break (with regards to eating and nail-biting, but more serious self-hating stuff, too). I don't know why, either. Things seem to be going so well--where is this coming from?

      Remember those lovely pictures of my house I posted just a day or two ago?   Well, here's what it looks like this morning:     My apologies for the picture quality--it's just that we seem to be having a flood!  Here's another view:     If it looks like water, that's what it is. See the "puddle" on the porch with the umbrellas in it? Well, here's how deep it is compared to my feet:     Yes, they are submerged, and no, I'm not standing in the deepest part, this is just what happened when I stepped out the front door.  This would be the street in front of our house. Notice there is water nearly to the dividing line:     We can't go anywhere, because of the pool at the end of our driveway, and the obvious impediments after that. Mark took one look and went back to bed. I think it's exciting, though. In sort of a sick way. Who says there is no water in Texas?

      I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me today. I have done everything I shouldn't have and none of what I should have (except that I did finally clean the floors). I stayed home from class for no reason, I went to Old Navy and spent $125 on clothes, I ate 4 super-size sugar cookies, I bit all my nails to the quick...you name it, I fucked it up today.   I don't feel depressed. I don't feel tired or sad or good or bad. Actually, come to think of it, I don't feel much of anything. Certainly nothing that could lead to any kind of motivation to DO anything. That seems bad. I have been eating terribly, sleeping plentifully, and haven't excercised in a week. The less I do, the less I feel like doing.  Obviously the thing to do is to force myself to do some stuff in order to break out of this vicious cycle. But I just don't have the motivation. And at this point I'm so digusted with myself I don't even want to try. I want another cookie and another nap, but even taking the dog out just seems like so much unnecessary work.

      We have had a most excellent weekend. First, on Friday night, Mark and I went to dinner and a movie with T. and S. We saw  urlLink Spartan . It wasn't great, but it was pretty good, and it was an enjoyable experience in general (non-crowded theater, good company). Then on Saturday we had an unexpected nice day, so I made Mark get up early and we finally went plant shopping. After a few hours and a more money than I want to admit spending, we turned the front of our house from this:     To this:    Other views:       After our hard day's work, we took naps and watched some of  urlLink Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure  on cable. Then Mark made dinner and we split a bottle of red wine. After half a bottle of wine, it seemed incumbent on us to keep drinking, so we did, both getting pleasantly smashed before we walked Chancey, hung out some more, had drunken sex a couple of times, and finally passed out.  Then today we slept in super-late and just hung out until about 5pm, at which time we went on a super grocery shopping trip. We now have food in the house! Before we went grocery shopping, however, I spent an hour or so like this:    And now, wonder of all wonders, we have a cleaned out fridge!  Then we came home and watched  urlLink The Sopranos , and now I'm going to take a bath. It's started to storm here, complete with real thunder and lightening, and I don't have anything I have to do before my 2pm class tomorrow.  Life couldn't be much better.

      I showed my ideas to Mark last night. He rejected the Picasso dove, saying his parents had that on their wall in poster form for years and he's always thought it was tacky. He really liked the tree, though. He also really likes the tree gate I posted a couple of days ago, and the olive branches.  So many options, so little body space...

      I just read the comments in Julia's latest  urlLink Tequila Mockingbird  post. They are all about folks on diets. South Beach, Atkins, etc.  I am so fucking sick of dieting I can't even tell you.   I've lost somewhere between 10-13 lbs. It's been four months. I seem to be stuck. I'm not sure I even want to lose more. I want to change shape, and I am working on that. In theory, I have 8-12 lbs. left to lose. I know the only way I'm actually going to get them off is with a DRASTIC calorie cut, something I haven't been willing to do so far (I've been staying at consuming about 500-750 fewer calories per day than I burn). Basically, I need to decide whether to forget about the dieting thing, be fine with this weight, and continue working on shape and scultping, or whether I want to make the health/nutritional sacrifice (not to mention being a raving lunatic because I am not getting enough calories) and try to lose 10 more lbs.  Seems like it would be an obvious choice. After all, I'm at a healthy weight, even by ridiculous BMI standards!   So why am I seriously considering the latter?

      The patio is done. It took three days. It was miserable, hot, backbreaking, and it looks half-assed. The best part, however, is the toll on my body:  These are my legs:      This is my toe:      My legs? Those are fucking misquito bites. No, I don't have chicken pox. I am just a Texas misquito buffet. It's fucking ridiculous. I have used half a bottle of anti-bug stuff (with DEET) this weekend, and they insist on biting and biting and biting. And then I have the bizarre red reaction you see in the pictures. At last count, there were over 40 bites on my lower legs alone. Yummy, huh?  Then there is my toe. I ran it over with a hand truck loaded with eight fifteen or twenty pound concrete paving stones. It's a lovely shade of purplish green now, swollen and throbbing. It was blackish purple at first, but it has faded. Unfortunately, it still hurts just about as much as it did to begin with.  So all in all it's been a wonderful, relaxing weekend...why am I not still on vacation?

      I'm listening to Suzanne's CD. It is beautiful. The more I listen, the more I feel like I knew her a little bit.   I don't know if this always happens when I come back from a trip. I suspect it does not. At any rate, I've come back feeling very different than I felt when I left. I feel like I'm on the verge of changes, but I can't quite see around the corner to identify them.  And then I reread that and I just feel like I'm being unncecessarily dramatic. Maybe nothing is changing. Maybe I'm just not caught up on sleep yet.  *Title courtesy of Lee Ann Womack, "I Hope You Dance"

      Tomorrow morning, way way way too early, I embark upon my great midwestern adventure. I am very excited. Right now I'm really nervous, too, because I feel very time crunched and like I am almost certainly forgetting something or forgetting to do something that I will find essential in a day or two. I've never been to any of these cities I'm visiting before, and in Chicago I am pretty much on my own to navigate mass transit and the like, so I'm a bit worried about that. I have printed out every map known to gracekind, though, plus route plans for everywhere I plan to go, so I can't imagine it's going to be that tough.  And I get to see so many of those folks over there ---> I'm so excited about that!!  Anyway, I still have stuff to do before I go to bed, and I have to be at the airport at 7am, so this is going to be it for now. I will be back late next week with lots of tales to regale you with. Or something. Until then, miss me!!

I wanted to start packing, so I looked up the weather forcasts in the cities I'll be staying in.  The weather is out to get me.  Thurs: Thunderstorms Fri: Scattered thunderstorms Sat: Scattered thunderstorms Sun: Scattered thunderstorms Mon: Scattered showers Tues: Scattered showers Wed: Rain  Great.

      **Warning: This entry gets a bit triggery.**  I don't know if anyone else is a big TLC head, like I am, but I watched the most amazing and awe-inspiring and depressing program I have seen in forever tonight. It was called  urlLink Growing up Old . It was about kids with Progeria, which is that disease which makes you age really fast. So these kids were from 6-14 and they looked like very small, very old people. And they had old people health problems (strokes, heart trouble, arthritis, etc.). It was so sad. One little boy was only 6 and already had two major strokes. All of the kids were bald, had vericose veins, swollen joints, wrinkled faces...  It gave me a lot to think about. Aging is one of the most difficult things that any of us go through--can you imagine going through it super fast? And at that age? How could you possibly understand it? I don't understand it, and I'm supposed to be an adult. The idea that my body is deteriorating, that my cells are dying faster than they are being born--that is nearly enough to make me cry. I look for wrinkles and try to pretend I don't have gray hair. How could I possibly have even wrapped my mind around these thoughts at six?   And even if the six year old doesn't understand that he's aging (the older kids most certainly did understand), he does understand that he's really really sick. I can't imagine that, either. Again, it's hard enough as an adult, or even as an elderly person--how can you be anything but permanently angry if you are a sick child? Or, maybe worse yet, if you have a sick child? That was the other thing this program really had me thinking about--how does one parent a child that is aging faster than you are? It kept showing these kids with their parents, and the parents all looked so young. I can't imagine the feeling of watching your child grow to old age in only a few years.  Mark and I were talking during the show, and one thing that came up was how some human disease just seems like a sick joke. This is one example of that. It's like a very vengeful god, who is very familiar with our culture and what hurts us the most, invents ways for death to be not only painful and dehabilitating, but also as horrifying and humiliating as possible. What other explanation can there be for having to watch yourslef grow to old age and die as a child? Isn't the one benefit of early death supposed to be avoiding old age? What other explanation can there be for Alzeimer's, turning people into something they never and torturing their families, often for years, before they finally die? What explanation for  cancers that attack the parts of our body that society most expects us to display? What explanation can there possibly be besides a god who hates us and has a very sick sense of humor?  I should so not watch TV.

      I have a running list in my head of things I want to do before I die. It's got to be 1000s of things long by now, and of course I have forgotten a lot of them (and done a few of them). But I've decided I should add them to my blog, for posterity, when I think of new ones.  Things I want to do before I die: 1. See Elvis Costello 2. Actually learn some kind of dance 3. Write a novel 4. Write a children's book 5. Travel to every continent 6. Learn a second language 7. Be a mother 8. Find faith, or have faith find me 9. Learn to knit 10. Live abroad

      So I have the allergies that will not stop. My throat is swollen and hurts, my eyes are watering, my nose is stuffed up, and I would give my right arm to be able to go back to bed, rather than going into work. Seriously. I feel fucking awful.   Wah wah wah.  To make matters infinitely worse, I agreed to work Monday-Wednesday this week. I agreed to do this knowing full well that I am flying out to give a talk that I have not yet written in Chicago on Thursday. I'll write it over the weekend, thought I. Wrong. I am no farther this morning than I was last week when I agreed to work these days.   So, to put it simply, I'm fucked. I feel exactly the same way as I did last week, before finals were over. This truly is the semester that never ends.

      Two things I love are rolled into one in  urlLink this book . It's a book about my favorite (I think) artist,  urlLink Frida Kahlo , illustrated by the author/illustrator of my favorite children's books, the amazing  urlLink Tomie de Paola ! It's fucking fabulous. If you have a kid, get it. If you don't, get it anyway. Hell, give me your address and I'll send it to your kids. There aren't enough kids in my life. My neices would inevitably think they are too old for it, and Sadie and Li-li are still a bit too young.  Today we solved all of our bed problems. We ordered the bed for our room, and we went shopping for something for the guest room. After hours of trial and vists to at least a dozen stores, we decided to just buck up, spend the money, and get something we like and can use in the future (hopefully as a couch, and hopefully sooner, rather than later, I say, because our current couch is an atrocity), rather than settling for whatever we could find the cheapest (not much, as it turns out). So we ended up with a very nice futon. Beautiful all hardwood frame, Japanese style, dark Java finish, thick futon mattress with inner coils, queen sized. It's really lovely. They'll deliver it on Wednesday.  So much adulthood.  We also took Chancey to his first agility class today. He was great! He did everthing he was supposed to do. It was wonderful. Mark was in heaven, too. I'm sunburned now, though. I have to remember that yes, it is summer here now, and yes, that does require sunscreen.  Lots of sunscreen.  Was it just me, or was tonight's episode of  urlLink The Sopranos  weirder than hell? Now Mark is watching  urlLink Deadwood . I've never actually watched this show, but just hearing it from the other room pisses me off. The cursing is so historically inaccurate! Can't they even get the easy details right?

      We are buying a bed.  urlLink This  bed, to be precise. Let's hear it for getting the mattress off the floor! I feel so grown up!  We're also trying to figure out what to do in our guest room to get that mattress off the floor. We'd like to just buy a box spring for it, but we can't find one used and don't want to pay for a new one. The mattress is actually in fairly sad shape, so we may just scrap the whole thing and put a futon in there (I think that's the best idea, but Mark just can't stand the idea of getting rid of anything, especially not a mattress we hauled across the country).  Is there anywhere you can donate mattresses that comes to pick them up?  Chancey has graduated to a group agility class! Our first one is tomorrow morning. I'm less than thrilled about the Sunday morning classes, but Mark was fairly beaming when the trainer told us he thought Chance was ready to move on to group work. Mark's been itching to try agility stuff for awhile, too. I'm sure it will be fun.  I still don't want to have to get up at 9:00 on Sundays, though. If I were able to get up at 9 on Sundays, I'd go to church. This class wipes out any possibility of my doing that for the next two months.  Oh well. Guess I'll have to remain a heathen a little bit longer.  By the way--what do you think of my fancy new template? Blogger added a bunch of new ones when they did all their other upgrade stuff. Very exciting. Now I don't have the same template as half the other blogs I look at!

      Or perfect punk rock resumes Or anorexic magazines It smells like girl, it smells like girl  Anybody recognize the title and following lines?  Believe it or not, this post is going to be related, albeit loosely, to the title.  Specifically, I am irritated because  urlLink Cameron Diaz  is not a geek.  And she's always supposed to be one! Her  urlLink Charlie's Angels  character,  urlLink Natalie , is so geeko-charming I could just puke. The show younger pictures of her with headgear, show her wearing Superman underwear and knocking over a row of bathroom stalls, and have her do that ridiculous "I'm-so-in-love-with-my-own-ass" dance at least ten times.  But she's just not a fucking geek! She's blonde, beautiful, thin, rich, famous, and KNOWS IT. They can put  urlLink fake spooge  in her hair to make it stand up all they want, and she's still fucking Cameron Diaz.  And she's an insult to real geeks everywhere. As if we don't have it hard enough without being supposed to live up to Cameron Fucking Diaz's standard of geekiness.  See, she's not making geekdom cool. She's making fun of geekdom and making that cool. And I resent it. If you are Barbie, just be Barbie. You can't be geek-chic without actually being a fucking geek.  Now that I have that strange rant out of my system...

      OK, first, the new Blogger template--very, very snazzy. I'm impressed. Go Blogger!  Now, on to how much I rock. I rock the house. I even rock the Casbah. Here is how much I rock the weekend:  1. 32 page paper on media portrayal of inner-military rape, not started until Friday night and not due until Wednesday night? Done. 2. Brunch with Renee and Sofiya? Attended. 3. Annual LBJ Follies? Also attended. 4. Alcohol consumed? None.  I would like mad props now, please.  I do still have stuff to do--two finals this week (one Wednesday, one Friday), and one of them requires a pre-written essay of a few pages that I will need to at least get started on this afternoon. Still, the fact that I worked my ass off all weekend and actually finished this paper (yes, this is the one I was whining about maybe having to take an incomplete or get an extension on or whatever) not just on time, but ahead of time, makes me giddy. Plus it's actually pretty good, or at least I thought it was last night at midnight or so when I wrote the conclusion. I'm actually sort of scared to go back and look at it now.

      Once again, I am struck by the overwelming urge to do more. I am not doing enough. Not doing enough to better myself, not doing enough to better the world around me, not doing enough to help people, not traveling enough, not loving enough, not living enough. I want to do more.  But it seems so difficult just to do what I must to get by, doing "enough" would be impossible. There is never enough time or enough money or enough energy. The whole situation is very frustrating.  This is stemming from a wonderful class I had tonight. My last class of the semester, and it couldn't have been better. I put myself on the line a bit and took a journalism class this semester--the subject was coverage of international crises. As one of the (many...I still have 30 pages left to write...) requirements for the course, we were to do 20 hours of volunteer work somewhere in the community and report back on it (write a field report and do an little informal oral presentation). Today, our last class, we had those presentations. And the organizations people worked with were so fascinating, so vital, and so in need. I ended up wanting to volunteer for all of them. And I ended up feeling really, really bad, because I just used the non-profit job I already had to fill the course requirement. I wasn't cheating or anything--the professor OK'd it--but I feel like I should have done more.   So I'm trying to figure out how to do more. Now is the absolute worst time to be thinking in these terms--I've got PLENTY to do in the next week or so, thanks! But I am thinking about the summer. Yes, I have to take a calculus course, and yes, I have to work full-time, but what else can I do? My reasons are fairly non-philanthropic--I want to contribute because I don't feel like I am pulling my weight, and that makes me feel like ass. But whatever my reasons are, one more volunteer body is one more volunteer body, right? And it's about damn time I got involved in something beyond myself.  That being said, I move on to the subject of friends and my not having any. It's quite strange. I went out to lunch today at a campus place (between work this morning and class this afternoon), and I ran into a group of acquaintances from school there. I talked to them some, but sat by myself and read my paper for the most part. I go to lunch by myself often enough now that I don't really think of it as weird, but today I was very much aware that these people were thinking "Poor pitiful Grace, doesn't have any friends to have lunch with," or something of the sort. And it's true. There isn't a single person at my school that I would call a friend. There are a handful of people I say hi to or am happy to have class with, and I'm doing better with school-oriented social events (such as going to Happy Hour after class yesterday), but basically, I have no friends.  The really surprising part, though, is that having no friends doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have lots of  friends. I have my online friends, and I have my real-life friends, most of whom happen to be far away at this point, rendering my relationships with them very similar to those with my online friends (although really, reading my blog and being in my internet community are the only ways to communicate with me from afar on anything resembling a regular basis--I don't even talk to my mom on the phone more than once or twice a month). I absolutely adore the friends I have and hope they will always be my friends, geography be damned. But not having friends at school here just doesn't bother me. And it's not that I don't think tere are people here I'd like to be friends with--I'm sure there are--but I don't know how to form friendships intentionally, and I can't be bothered to figure it out.  Is that severely misanthropic? Maybe it's because I have Mark and we spend a ton of time together, but I honestly don't think that's the bulk of it. I just don't consider geographic nearness to be a particularly important factor in friendship, I guess. And at this point, I don't even consider regular communication to be that important a factor--as seeing Howell and Melinda and Ron and Sandy in D.C. the other weekend demonstrated to me, we fall right back into the same friendship no matter how recently or not we have talked. And to me, that's what it's all about. If they need me, I'm here, and if I need them, I trust they'll be around.  Still, I should probably attempt to be at least marginally social here. I'm really not an anti-social person. Just lazy, I guess. Or guarded? I don't know. Mostly I think I just don't have the patience to develop friendships over a long period of time--I love hanging out with good, close friends, but I'm not exactly enamored with the first date-esque stages before that. And making new friends really does remind me of dating, another activity I would never be good at and I'm kind of glad not to engage in.  This all reminds me of how strange it is to meet people IRL whom you have interacted with for a long period of time online. The idea that you are just now "meeting" them is so strange, because chances are you know more about them and have shared more with them than is true of most of the people you see quite often in your everyday life (at least in my circles, this seems to be the case). So it's not really meeting them. Ani has a line that goes, "I have only just met an old, old friend," and I always think of that when I meet someone whom I already know I like. It's a strange dynamic. On one hand, you wish you could just brush away all the preliminary getting to know you stuff that is inherent in meeting someone, but on the other hand, you don't want to be too familiar with someone who you "just met." And I know that I am far more open online that I would be in relationships with people in person, so it's weird to meet someone and know how much they already know about me. It's this strange feeling of not knowing what face to put on, because they are going to recognize that your public face isn't you--after all, they've never seen it before.  Actually, that makes it sound like it's a really excellent way to meet people, doesn't it? No pretenses that way. Why doesn't it actually work like that?  Or maybe it does.

      I'm calmer this evening. I finished one project, got a relatively decent start on two others, had one due date extended, and generally feel like maybe there is some hope after all. I'm sure I won't be saying that in a day or two, but for now, I feel pretty OK about things.  Partially it has just been a good day. S. and T. got their referral, finally. They will be bringing their daughter home in only a couple of months. I'm so excited for them I can hardly stand it. I of course wanted to rush right over there tonight when I heard the news, but they need time to themselves now, I think, and we will celebrate with them tomorrow night.  In other good news, I got my financial aid stuff for the summer and next year, and I am getting a hefty sum in subsidized loans, which is good. Enough, actually, that I could not work next year if I didn't want to. So that's a nice option to have, particularly because I don't think I am going to get a TA'ship (supposed to hear about that tomorrow morning).  I'm also getting really excited about my trip in a couple of weeks. I am hoping to get to meet some  urlLink online   urlLink friends . A  urlLink bunch  of  urlLink online   urlLink friends , actually! Can't wait.  OK. Shower. Sleep. Yes. Good.

      So I have alluded a few times to my massive stress level of late. Well, I just spent all fucking weekend reading, writing, and worrying, and things have reached a pretty critical point.  I have too much shit to do and not enough time to do it in nor energy to do it. Looking at my calendar for the next two weeks makes my stomach hurt. I only managed to write nine not-very-good pages this weekend, and I have 50ish to go in the next two weeks, plus two finals and countless other crap. Things look bad.  I don't know how this is happening now. My undergrad was fucking intense. It was way, way more work than grad school. And I survived it. And I don't remember more than a couple of times I felt this hopeless at the end of the semester. Maybe I just forget too easily. Mark says this happened every semester. Maybe I'm just getting too fucking old for this shit.  Or maybe it's the fact that I've been sick all fucking semester and I have the worst allergies of my life in this hellhole and the Claritin I am taking every fucking day is doing fuck-all to stop it. Maybe it's that I have a house and a dog and a relationship now, and I feel like they deserve my attention too, so I can't dedicate myself soley to school the way I could in undergrad.  Whatever it is, it's running me down, and scenarios that include "take an incomplete" are running through my head more often than they ought to. I've never, in my entire life, turned something in late. The idea of starting now is just more than I can fucking bear. One of the reasons I came here (albeit a minor one) is that I thought it would be a walk in the park compared to what I went through in undergrad. This isn't about academia, it's about certification. To be defeated at this point, to turn something in late, or take an incomplete...It would be a fucking humiliation. School is supposed to be what I'm good at, for God's sake.  You know what's pissing me off the most right now? Feeling that I'm being stupid by pouring this all out in a blog entry, because I know I am opening myself up to ridicule from some of the nastier elements of the internet, who prey on weaknesses people display in their blogs like bleached blonde, Ugg-wearing vultures. Well dig right in. And fuck you in advance.

      OK. I've thought about it. I've consulted with a number of sources, both personal and official. And I've made up my mind.  I am taking next year off from school and working full-time at The New Job, which I will start as soon as I am finished with my internship. Well, semi full-time (32 hrs/week). No classes except for the correspondence calc class I have to get through before January 31. Then I'll go back to school full-time the following year, and I may or may not be asked to stay at the job, which may or may not go down to 16-24 hrs/week. Depending on how I feel about it then, I may or may not stay.  My heart, my gut and my brain all agree this is the right thing to do, as do most of the folks I've consulted. I'm slowly getting over the misgivings coming from the Guilt Place that thinks I should be able to do everything all at once, even when I know I can't.  So...lots of changes. Feels weird to think I won't be going to school in the fall, but honestly it's mostly a huge relief. I have to get a budget worked out and stick to it to make sure I make the most of this opportunity to dig my way out from under some of my loan debt. And I have to keep up with the calc class so time doesn't get away from me.   In the meantime, I have to focus on putting myself back together again. I haven't been to work in two days--the damnable head cold and my overwhelming depression have conspired to keep me in bed (Skye, I trust you'll keep the second part of that clause under your hat and just go with the illness explanation). I could easily succumb to it and spend the rest of the week or more there, but I won't do that. Tomorrow I have to get back on my feet. Enough is enough with the self-pity and mopiness.  And the goddamn shrink still hasn't called me back. Really makes me wonder what happens to folks with a more dire need for psychiatric help.

      First, I keep getting spam urging me to eliminate my bills the Christian way. Seriously. I am almost curious enough about what the Christian means of bill elimnation would be to open the messages. But not quite.  Secondly, a thought has come into my tiny brain: What if I just take next year off from school? I could work 4 days/week, make a ton o' cash, and not be stressed out. Then when the contract is up in a year I could go back to school full time, have the schedule I want, and not have to work during school.   I can't think of any good reasons not to do that, except the possibility of losing my aid. I'll have to check on that.

      There is a plan in place for next semester. It involves me working 30 hrs/week and taking 10 hours of classes. This includes class from 10:30-12 and then 2-9pm on Tuesdays. That ought to be fun.   I'll graduate a semester late under this plan, which is really no big deal. I'll also save enough to pay off a huge chunk of my undergrad loans, which is a big deal.  All in all, I'm psyched. Worried as all hell, but psyched.  I just wish the possibility of quitting school completely would leave my little head...

      So Mark totally fucking rules. And I am going to tell you why.  Last night, I came home to find a clean house and several loads of clean laundry. Then, he sat me down and had a talk with me about how my depression is obviously getting worse, I sleep all the time, and I need to go to the doctor.  I balked at it at the time, but he's right, of course, and it got me off my ass today and I went through the extremely tedious and fairly humiliating process of filling out a transfer request for my medical records and filling out the 19,000 pages of pre-shrink paperwork. So, in theory, I will get an appt. sometime in the next eon.  In the meantime, I wait. I am actually doing fairly well today--I've been really busy, I got less than 8 hours of sleep last night, and I feel damn good. Not even too tired. But I know it won't last. I feel a lot like I did before--as if there is something physically wrong with me.   I wonder if it's normal to conceptualize one's psychiatric illnesses as physical? It really does feel that way to me.  Anyways. Yeah. I'm going to go read now.  I got a library card today!! Wheee!!

       Things I Need To Do  Perform at work. Start my calculus class. Refill prescriptions. Clean up my house. Do laundry. Send out belated Father's Day cards. Figure out my finances. Buy a desk. Rearrange the office after I buy a desk. Fix the table my computer is currently on for outside use. Procure patio furniture.   Things I Want To Do  Learn how to put bullets in my posts. Go back to bed. For a few days. Or maybe weeks. Get a library card. Send T's package. Make mixed CDs for various people. Put pictures in albums. Shop at book stores. Read.  You'll notice that nothing appears on both lists? Yep, that's the problem.

      A fascinating meme, started by  urlLink The Most Honorable Frog .)  My room in hell would be painted the same Pepto-Bismol pink as my ill-fated childhood bedroom. The paint would be peeling, the walls would be dirty and yellowing. There would be tons of clutter everywhere and I'd never be able to find anything. The bed would be single, hard and extra-short, and only have one very thin pillow. The sheets would be very low thread-count percale, and they would be stained. The bed would never be made. All of the blankets would be scratchy wool.  The floor of my room in hell would be covered in wool carpet, so my feet would constantly itch or I'd have to wear shoes. I'd have no closet space and no shelves or drawers to put things in. There would be uncovered windows to look in on me in the night, with extra-bright street lights just outside and loud, abusive neighbors.  The dust would be inches thick over everything in my room in hell. There would be no vacuum for the rug, dust clothes, or any way to get rid of the clutter. There would be a musty smell, as if somewhere something is molding.   There would be a small black and white TV with lousy reception playing "Days of Our Lives" over and over again, with extra-long breaks for that super irritating "Mama's got the magic" Clorox commercial. The stereo would only be able to play contemporary country and Michael Bolton.   All food in my room in hell would incorporate slimy mussels and boiled spinach. Nothing would have any salt. There would be no Pepsi. It would have the world's slowest dial-up connection.

      Depression is coming on. I can see the cloudiness at the edges of my vision. And I'm so tired, as if I've run marathons and solved equations for days. Everything is sad. My officemate's music is making me want to cry. The usual Phoenix shit is setting my teeth on edge.  Timing, as usual, is bad. Mom is still here. Howell and Melinda will be here in three days. I just want to get in bed and stay there.

      My mom is coming to visit us! She gets here this evening and she'll be here until Tuesday afternoon.  I'm oddly nervous. I guess I feel like I have something to prove about my big, grown-up life, you know? This is the first time she has ever visited me, now that I am far away from home and living my  so-called adult life. That and I am nervous about how she'll deal with the dog.  I have a whole list of things to do with her while she is here, but I don't know how much of it is actually going to happen, given the horrible fucking weather we have been having. The radio dude this morning described tomorrow and the weekend as "mid 90s with gross humidity." Great.  My stomach is all in knots. And she's really not a judgemental person at all, so I don't know what my problem is.

      My toe is back to black and purple underneath the nail. It was better for a couple of days. Guess it's probably going to fall off. Or at least the nail is going to fall off. :)  I'm also very congested, and I have cramps and a backache and general first-day-of-period pain.  So yeah, I could be better.

      So, as you undoubtably already know, Ronald Reagan has finally died.   God, Nancy must be so relieved.  I have no love lost for Ronald Reagan. Go to  urlLink Jasper's  blog to read a summary of pretty  much how I feel about his death, though it's written much better than I could have managed.  But that's all about Ronald Reagan the POTUS. And right on as it is, I wonder if there wasn't once more, you know? There had to have been a person in there somewhere, and that person just died of Alzheimer's.  I guess Alzheimer's is what I really want to talk about here, rather than Ronald Reagan.   But how the fuck do I even begin to talk about Alzheimer's with feeling some sympathy for Ronald Reagan, and particularly for those around him? After watching someone die of it, slowly and with no honor, I wouldn't even wish it on Ronald Reagan.  So I guess it's like this: if the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan had been successful in '81, I think the world would have been a better place. The man did a ton of damage and no good I can think of. I would not have mourned his death by gunshot before he had time to terrorize the poor.  But I mourn for his death at 93 of Alzheimer's. For one thing, the damage has already been done, and his legacy is living on stronger than ever in today's White House. More than that, though, I am horribly, horribly sorry that anyone has to live through what he and his family have lived through in these past years. I am glad for them and for him that it is finally over.

      This is another one of those occaisons wherein I take something that is bothering me from The Phoenix and bring it to my blog to expound upon my thoroughly. Just so's you know.  The subject is work ethic. As far as I am concerned, good work ethic means taking pride in the job you are doing, getting what needs to be done and done well, and doing things that need to be done without being specifically intstructed to do so. Period. Busy work does not require good work ethic. Just doing something job-related every minute you are on the clock does not necessarily imply good work ethic. You can be "busy" all day and have lousy work ethic, and you can spend a part of your day at work goofing off, posting on the Internet, whatever, and still have good work ethic.  My first "real" job was as a dishwasher and then a waitress at a cafe. I started right after I turned 14. It was a miserable, back-breaking job. The kitchen was a million degrees, you were running your whole shift, and you got paid minimum wage (although in retrospect it actually paid more with tips than most of what I've done since then) In those kinds of jobs in Oregon at that time (I have no idea if it's different now), you are legally guaranteed a 15 minute break for every four hours of work and a half hour lunch break for each eight hour shift (I think...it's been a long time, could be slightly different). The cafe where I worked (and the cafe after that...) never bothered with this. There was no "I'm going on my break now" or "I'm having my lunch now"--you sneaked in a few bites if and when you had time, and you sat down if and when you had time AND nobody was looking. One of the cooks with whom I worked said that the only reason she started smoking was because she knew she'd have to leave the kitchen to do it, and therefore she could justify leaving to take a break.  I learned pretty quickly in that environment that the only way to get a break was to take one--no one was going to offer one to me. Fair enough.  My next job, another waitressing gig, worked the same way, though it was a smaller and much more friendly enviorment. No set break times, just take one when you can. Sometimes it was slow and I got sent home early because there was nothing to do. Fair enough. The thing that pissed me off, though, and still does to this day, was when there was nothing to do and I had to stay for whatever reason, because those were the time when I had to invent something to do. Generally something that was not my job (back up cooking, etc.) Whatever. Annoying, but that's how service works unless you have a cool boss who realizes that s/he is paying you to be there, and if there is nothing to do, there's nothing to do. Inventing something doesn't get their money back.  My next job was working at a public pool. I opened the pool in the morning, did clean-up, and worked the desk, taking money, scheduling lessons, etc. Often, there was nothing to do but sit there. My boss was very chill. She understood that she was paying me because someone had to be there. I read or wrote when I had nothing to do. I still had no set breaks or lunch, but I didn't much care, because I had lots of down time that I could rest and whatever. If I needed to leave the desk for some reason, I had to get someone to cover, but there was no set relief.  Next I was a lifeguard. Being a lifeguard is one of those jobs that requires constant attention when you are on. I totally respect that and I never did anything when I was lifeguarding but watch people swim. Oddly, though, there were STILL no set breaks, and if I needed to pee or something, I had to get someone to cover.  Since then, I have had a series of office-type jobs in a variety of locations and at a variety of levels of responsibility (and pay). These jobs have offered me set "duty-free" (and unpaid) lunches for the most part (though the one I have now does not, which is fine), but there are still not set breaks. By now, I have no problem taking breaks when I have time/think I need them. And I don't think that says a goddamn thing about my work ethic.   To go a bit farther, it is possible that I actually take MORE breaks than I am legally guaranteed in my current job (and in past jobs) on some (or even most) days. And I don't think that means I have a bad work ethic either. Why? Because I get everything that is asked of me done and done well. I seek out more projects. I take interest and pride in my work. If I say something is going to be done on time, it is, and if I say I am going to be somewhere, I'm there. I'm not being paid to sit at my desk for eight hours a day or whatever--I am being paid to produce products, and I do a goddamn good job producing them. What more should an employer ask for?  To continue on this tangent, I think that most people, especially people in lower-paying  service jobs, administrative jobs, etc. are doing more than they need to be for what they are paid. An argument can be made that if you do personal things on work time you are "stealing" from your company. Well, most likely your company is also stealing from you. Ever asked to do stuff that isn't in your job description? Your company is stealing from you. Even take on more responsibility than you are paid to take on, or cover for a co-worker (or better yet, boss)? Your company is stealing from you. The list goes on, but the bottom line as far as I am concerned remains whether or not the work gets done and done properly. If it does, why the fuck should your employer care if you work fast and then take breaks, or work slowly and don't?

         OK, so today there was some excitement in the world of my toe. I went to the doctor. They admonished me for not coming in earlier, then they burned a small hole in my toenail using a thing that looks like  urlLink this . The tip gets really hot and then they just burn a little hole. After the hole was there, the doc squeezed blood and puss out from under my toenail. It's still coming out, actually. It's amazing how much was built up in there. Then I had X-rays to see if it is broken (no fracture on the X-ray, but the doc said she wasn't at all sure that there wasn't one anyway, or maybe just a sprain). They they put a very awkward splint on it and sent me home. I have to go back on Friday to see if it needs another drainage hole drilled and check for infection. The doc said the toenail will probably fall off, since there is a lot of blood clotted up in the nail bed, but it will probably grow back OK if it does fall off, as long as it doesn't get infected.  So...it hurts a bit less with the pressure relieved, though it honestly doesn't hurt as much less as they said it would. And they gave me the cauterizing thing to take home. That was the coolest part.

      I am going to the urgent care on campus this afternoon, after talking to the guy on the nurse advice line. He mentioned the following words in reference to what many need to be done to my toenail: "extract," "remove," excise" and "cauterize."  I am unhappy. They had better give me good drugs.

      Once upon a time, in the little four-aisle grocery store in the town where I grew up, I had a big thing for  urlLink U-No bars . Specifically, the mint ones. They were the best thing ever. I loved them. As you saw if you clicked on my link, they have been discontinued for some time now.  I found a substitute. They are pricer and not quite as good, but the Meltaway Mint  urlLink Seattle Chocolates Truffle Bar  is a reasonable substitute.  And all is well.

      Do you ever just want to hole up by yourself for a year or two? I'm serious. I'd like nothing more right now than to just sit at my house, completely alone, and do my own thing. Read, watch TV, cook for myself. Not go out, and most of all, NOT talk to anybody. No social conventions and no responsibilities. I even want the dog to go away for awhile.    I have no idea where this is coming from, or if it's healthy or not. I have never been hyper-social, but I think I may be getting a bit overly reclusive. I have this reoccuring daydream of a tiny one-room house by the ocean (not the Atlantic or the Gulf, either, the REAL ocean) where I don't see another human being for days or even weeks at a time. Where I don't have all my shit surrounding me to tell me who I am. Swimming and eating healthy and sleeping a lot. Writing. Reading. Being.    It's bad enough that I don't want to go to parties or talk on the phone, but the thing that makes me feel really guilty is the wish that I lived alone. Most of the time, I love living with Mark, but right now....God, I wish he'd go away! And it really has nothing to do with him, either. I am feeling trapped by anyone breathing my air.     I suppose ultimately it doesn't matter whether or not it's healthy or whatever, because it's not going to happen. Getting myself stranded on a conveniently well-equipped desert island doesn't really look to be in the cards.

      One of the things I bought today at Bookwoman was a book made from collaged cardboard pieces 3-ringed together with pieces of recycled paper between them. Sort of a blank book/journal thing. I used to make collaged journals for myself all the time, and I have to tell you, mine kicked the ass of the one I bought today. They were just way, way cooler. Smarter, more political, and more artistic. Not to mention sturdier.  And I paid $17 for the one I bought today.    Which makes me think...could I sell the ones I made to people? I loved making them--I always made more than I could use. And I still collect collage materials, even though I haven't collaged anything in a long time.  If I wanted to try to sell them, how would I go about it? Website?     Advice? Ideas?

      The following came across my email this afternoon:     Dear Friends and Supporters of BookWoman,      We are writing to ask your help. The still sluggish economy, our rising rent, and the difficulties of the construction project on Lamar Blvd. are all colliding to make this our most challenging summer ever. BookWoman is having a severe cash crisis! We are asking that you come shop at BookWoman right away and tell all your friends! If 160 people each spend $25 here in the next two weeks we would be able to pay our August rent on time. Why not start your holiday shopping now!      Or if you are able to give a small donation of $10, $25, or $50, it would be most gratefully and lovingly received. Although BookWoman is not traditional non-profit, we exist to serve all the women of Austin and all our diverse communities- both in the selection of the products that we carry and the in-store programming that we support and provide.We are actively looking for more economic digs...any leads will be welcome. It is really hard to believe, but we are nearing our 30th anniversary. It's a huge and humbling milestone. Hopefully we will be able to continue our work.    In Sisterhood: with love and gratitude for so many years of your support,     Susan, Kristen, Marla & Jennifer     BookWoman     918 W.12 St.     Austin, Texas 78703      www.ebookwoman.com        First thing is first--if you have  any  spare money lying around and an inclination to help keep a really wonderful store in business, go on down there, if you are local, or go to  urlLink www.ebookwoman.com  and buy something, if you aren't.   Secondly, this is the third or fourth feminist book store in trouble I've heard about lately. There are no words for how much this pisses me off. It is ESSENTIAL that we keep these businesses going. Given the social and political climate around us, protecting our safe havens is more than a good idea, it's a necessity. These stores were some of the first places in the past few decades for women to gather, to be safe, to talk and laugh and cry and be together. They carry books, magazines, music that other stores won't touch, full of information that we need to have access to, as well as entertainment that makes our lives richer. This is a service to the feminist community, and it is one that doesn't pay for itself. If we don't get off our collective asses and support these stores, they won't be here much longer.

      I could totally be making this up, but I believe NPR told me this morning that today is Judy Chicago's birthday. Or maybe that was yesterday. At any rate, if you don't know of her already, check out some of  urlLink her work . I think she is pretty famous, so everyone has probably already heard of her, but just in case.    My favorite thing she's done, I think, is  urlLink Womanhouse , although that may be for more political than artistic reasons.  urlLink The Dinner Party  is truly amazing, and it's of a similar political bent. Also, for the Princess, check out  urlLink Quilting Bee .    When I worked at the art museum, one of the things I did was helped out with the docent program. The average docent was a well-off white woman somewhere between 55 and 75. There were a couple hundred of them. And they came in once a week to hear lectures. One lecture was to be about women in art, so I excitedly sat in on it. The speaker showed the slide from Womanhouse of the "Menstruation Bathroom."   I was a lot more amused than some of them were, I think. And I was definitely more amused than the assistant curator who ran the program was. (Hi Sarah!)

      You know, I complain a lot. But nothing shuts me up faster than a gander at my new favorite blog,  urlLink Sweat Equity.  I know the folks who are blogging on Sweat Equity in real life, and I know they have real, honest-to-God, hard-work type jobs. After which they come home and do things like refinish floors and strip wallpaper at their new house.     And it's all I can do to do the dishes after sitting at a desk job all day.

      Type "you know you're from (your state) when" into Google. Bold the ones that apply to you.     You know you're from Oregon when you...        Feel guilty throwing an aluminum can in the trash.   Use the word "sunbreaks" and know what it means.       Know more than 10 words to describe a cup of coffee.       Obey all traffic laws except "keep right unless passing."      Never go camping without waterproof matches and ponchos.    Feel overdressed wearing a suit to a nice restaurant.   Hear the word "ferry" and think of boats and long waits.       Know more people who own boats than own air conditioners.       Stand on a deserted street corner in the rain waiting for the light to change.       Know at least eight people who work for Intel or Nike, or used to work for Tektronix.       Are amazed by an accurate weather forecast.   Consider if it doesn't have snow on it or has not recently erupted, regardless of altitude, it is a "hill" not a "mountain".   Only honk your car horn if a collision is imminent; never for anything else.    Go to a really nice bar and sit at a table.    Think skiing always means being covered from head to toe, in snow or water.     In winter, go to work in the dark and go home in the dark, but only have an eight hour work day.       Can taste the difference between Starbucks, Seattle's Best and Veneto's.       Know the difference between Chinook, Coho, and Sockeye salmon.       Know how to pronounce Sequim, Puyallup, Issaquah, Oregon and Willamette.   Consider swimming an indoor sport.       Are not fazed by: "Today's forecast: showers followed by rain," and "Tomorrow's forecast: rain followed by showers."   You cannot wait for a day with "showers and sun breaks."   Have no concept of humidity without precipitation.   Know that Boring is a town in Oregon and not just a state of mind.       Can point to at least two volcanoes, even if you cannot see through the cloud cover.   You exclaim "the mountain is out" when it is a pretty day and you can actually see it.    Put on your shorts when the temperature gets above 50, but still wear your hiking boots and Gore-Tex coat.    Switch to your sandals when it gets about 60, but keep the socks on.    Have actually used your mountain bike on a mountain.    Think people who use umbrellas are either wimps or tourists.    Buy new sunglasses every year, because you can't find the old ones after such a long time.    You often switch from "heat" to "a/c" in the same day.     You use a down comforter in the summer.    You design your kid's Halloween costume to fit under a raincoat.     You know all the important seasons: Almost Winter, Winter, Still Raining (spring), Road Construction (summer), and Deer and Elk Season (Fall).

      I realize that on a global scale, it doesn't suck that much, but it's Sunday night and I am realizing that I've had a really pretty lousy weekend. That sucks.    Also, my hair is currently somewhere between orange and pink and seems bound and determined to stay this way. That sucks.    Finally, not only have I had little fun this weekend, I've done precisely 0 loads of laundry. That sucks.

      Last night, I finished reading Gini Sikes'  urlLink 8 Ball Chicks . The book is a study of female gang members in Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, circa the mid-late 1990s. Sikes did a year of research, traveling around and talking to the girls themselves, their families, police, social workers, etc. Her level of involvement is amazing. She obviously cares about her "subjects" and her willingness to go into depth with them, and to examine herself as much as she is examining them, is truly inspirational. I will definitely look for other work she's done (I think she's a journalist and this is her only book, but I'm not certain).   The subject matter of the book is amazing and horrifying. I am totally aware that I grew up white and rural and privledged, but being aware of it in a vague way is different than reading these stories. The things some of these girls lived through before they were even in their late teens were truly worse than I could have imagined. And their cavalier attitudes about it all, the expectation that it wasn't going to go away and that was just the way life was...it chilled me. The common threads in their stories--abusive parents, sexual abuse at a young age, poverty, violent relationships with boyfriends, pregnancy early and often--are the stuff stereotypes are made of, but when you read about it happening to someone specific, Coco or Alicia or Sad Eyes, it becomes something totally different. I think that speaks really well of Sikes' work.   I don't know where I am really going with this...I haven't gathered my thoughts about the book enough to write anything resembling an actual critique of it. I guess I just wanted to recommend it (with a huge trigger warning, because it is HARD to read). It's making me think a little bit differently about feminism this week.

      I've been thinking and talking and writing a ton about money lately.  Saving, spending, debt, shopping. I'm reading books about it, too. It's  actually pretty crass, and I am getting sick enough of hearing myself  talk about it, so I definitely owe a debt (shit! another one!) of  gratitude to the folks who have been listening to me work throught it  and giving advice about it, particularly a certain Princess. I really  appreciate the willingness to give advice without judgement.     But the bottom line, of course, is that annoying everyone around me  with a subject most people would rather not talk about isn't going to  fix anything. I have to make my decisions myself and get myself through  this one. Reading and talking to other people has its place, but it's  no good trying to put the impetus on someone else, which is part of  what I do when I ask advice on questions that I really already know the  answers to.   One good thing the books I've been reading and  people I've been chatting with has given me is perspective. While I  think it's true that I spend too much, shop too much, save too little,  etc., I don't have credit card debt, a car loan, etc. My only debt is  student loans, which are huge, but I've never missed a payment on them  (aside from when they are deferred). I am also paying the interest on  the non-subsidized portion while I'm in school. This isn't to say that  I don't have a problem, just that it hasn't reached epic proportions  yet, so if I can get a handle on it now, I'll be much happier.    I am still deciding exactly what form that handle should take. I know  that I don't feel like depriving myself, and that stopping shopping  completely isn't a goal. I also know that it's going to feel great to  make large loan payments during this year of pulling in an income, and  that I have several savings goals to reach. So I'll figure it out. It's  trial and error, I suppose.    In the meantime, I'm going to try to shut up about it.

      I'm sure everyone is going to be all over this in a matter of minutes, but I can't resist.    Martha Stewart got 5 months in jail, 2 years probation and a $30,000 fine for her shady stock deal.    Fuck that. As  Bitch  rightly pointed out, this is a fucking witch hunt. Yes, she fucked up, but Jesus H. Christ--Ken Lay does shadier things before he gets out of bed in the morning! In a man, the behavior is good business. Just ask Vice-President Enron.     I am so sick of this country's hypocrisy I could scream.     By the way, the new Blogger writing/editing screen rocks my world. Except that yesterday I wrote a long post about my triumph over Linda, and when I tried to spellcheck, it crashed. That was no good.

      You know that saying about true wisdom being knowing that you know nothing? Well, I think I'm getting there.  Things have been pretty riled up over at The Phoenix in recent days, and basically the conclusion I have come to is that everyone else is right and I am wrong. I know that sounds obnoxiously self-depricating, but I'm totally serious. I need to learn to fucking listen to people, because they often have things to tell me that I need to hear, whether I enjoy hearing them or not.   It was incredibly hubristic of me to think that I could start a space that would somehow be immune to all of the old battles and old bullshit. And it didn't work. And that makes me sad and it makes me feel defeated. Really, though, what it should make me feel is humble. Why the hell did I ever think I would be capable of this? I'm 24 years old, I'm white, I'm straight (well, I'm not, but you know what I mean)...what the fuck do I know about oppression? What the fuck do I know about anything, really?

      It would not be an overstatement to say that I have identity politics issues.   I don't know how to identify. I don't know what to make of other people's identifications. I don't want to support factionism when I think we should all be helping each other, but some theories make more sense than others to me, and a lot of times that is due to shared experiences.  So yeah. If I had to make a list, here is my identity. This is mainly for my own edification, and it's subject to change:  I am: 1. A human being 2. A woman 3. A friend/partner/daughter/sister 4. A feminist 5. A bisexual  6. A socialist 7. An Oregon native 8. A small town native 9. A death penalty opponent 10. A pacifist  There are more. And more will be added. Those are the ones I think about when quickly trying to list my identity politics, though.  I wonder if Unitarian-Universalist is going to make it on to this list? I am beginning to think it might...

      Yes, I suck. It is completely obvious to me that I suck. My life in recent days has been little but an excercise in discussing the numerous ways in which I suck.  OK! I get it! I suck!   Now leave me the fuck alone.

      My grandfather would have been 75 today.  He's been gone 20 years.  As I was 4 when he died, I don't have a whole lot of substantial memories of him. The ones I do have are suspect--do I actually remember this stuff, or do I just think I remember it because I saw a picture or someone told me a story? I have to believe that some of them are mine, though, especially as they get dimmer over the years.  He bought me bags of jelly beans at Arlene's Cafe. They came in a ziploc bag and cost $1. Our deal was that he would eat the black ones, I would eat the rest. Still seems like a good deal to me. When I was in high school, I used to put black jelly beans on his grave.  I remember him being thin, so thin, and coughing. Sitting in an easy chair, coughing. He had lung cancer. Since he died when I was 4, he probably had cancer for most of my life.  It is completely possible to miss someone you never really knew. I still miss him to this day. I've lost six other grandparents and great-grandparents since he died, but I still feel his loss the most. And today, he would have been 75.

      Caveat to the non sports-minded: In a volleyball game, there are two referrees and two line judges. The sole purpose of the line judges is to stand at opposite corners of the court and judge whether balls fall in or out of bounds.   The sermon today was about sports, competition, etc. The second element of it was about abdicatin of responsibility. Where people used to say "no harm, no foul," meaning that even if there was technically a foul, if it didn't harm the flow of play, it was not worth stopping for, they could now say "no foul, no harm." No foul, no harm. That would mean that unless a foul was called, i.e. unless you got CAUGHT breaking the rules, no harm was done. You see this in football, where linemen are taught to hold without getting called on it, for example.  The minister was making a point about how the competitive nature of sports leads us to shrug off personal responsibility for following the rules. We do not call fouls on ourselves. If you step out of bounds making a touchdown and nobody notices, you sure as hell don't argue with them. If a mistake is made, then, it is the responsibility of the official, for not seeing it, rather than the player for doing it.  The point was that putting what is right and what is wrong in someone else's hands allows us to break rules without culpability. Which got me to thinking, what I need in my life isn't a referree, it's a line judge. I don't want someone else to make the calls--I am rather fond of being in charge--but I want someone else to stand at the corners and tell me when something is in bounds and when it is out of bounds. Then when someone argues with a call I've made, I can simply point to the line judge. She did it. The expert opinion given to me was that was out, so I called it out. It's like the president blaming a bad war on the CIA.  But I don't get a line judge. I have to figure out for myself if the balls I am lobbing back and forth are landing within bounds or not. And I just can't see the whole court, so there's a lot of guesswork involved. Sometimes, I make the wrong call. Often, even. And ultimately, it's nobody's responsibility but mine.

      Last night I had the good fortune to run across an episode of  urlLink  My So-Called Life   It was on Noggin, I think? Apparently they play it every Friday night. Anyway, I was thrilled to dig into the couch and reconnect with Angela and Rayanne and Rickie and (of course) Jordan Catalano.  As I was watching the espisode, though, something seemed strange and out of place to me. Almost...dated. At first I thought it was just that I am now a lot older than those characters were supposed to be ( urlLink Claire Danes , who played Angela on the show, is the same age as I am in real life, so when I was 14 watching the show, she was 14 making it). Then I thought it must just be the age of the show--after all, it is ten years old.  The plot lines of high school dramas don't change all that much, though. Sure, MSCL was made before everyone had IM, so there is a fair amount of talking on the phone, but other than that the drama is pretty much the standard fare--sex, friendships, family, the future. So why did the characters on MSCL seem so archaic?  Then I figured it out. It was because they were covered up.  No, not their emotions. Those were pretty wide open. Their bodies. The difference was their  clothes . Angela Chase almost never wore less than three layers, one of them generally being overalls and another nearly always made of flannel. And it wasn't just sexless Angela--the non-virginal characters weren't flaunting their stuff either.  urlLink Rayanne , the supposed wild one, dressed in tights, boots, a big coat...even  urlLink Sharon , the one who was actually supposed to be HAVING sex on the show, who had  breasts , which much was made of in the first few epsiodes (if I remember correctly), never showed much skin. In fact, she sort of dressed like a kindergarden teacher.  If you compare this to current teen dramas--not just the shitty ones, but even endearing and offbeat ones like  urlLink Joan of Arcadia , you will get an assault of midriffs, ass cracks, high heels and cleavage. Not to be a huge prude, but Angela looked a whole hell of a lot more comfortable in her overalls than Joan does in her lowriders.  It make me sad to think that there was a time only ten years ago where teenage girls on television weren't expected to be sexpots. Sure, part of it was the impervious nature of grunge culture at that time (thank you, thank you, THANK YOU Kurt Cobain), but I don't think that tells the whole story. After all, baggy "grungy" clothes stayed "in style" and available a lot longer for teenage guys than they did for girls. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, guys are still encouraged to wear baggy jeans and button-downs, even if they are supposed to be a little bit cleaner than Jordan Catalano's ever were. A teenage girl dressed like Angela Chase, though? There would be two names for her--dyke or bag lady.  For the first time, I realize that there was some luck in when I came of age. Sure, I'm part of the first generation who started having sex knowing about AIDS; sure, I graduated from high school into a dismal economy and graduated from college into a much worse one; I'll even admit that Converse All-Stars are not any more attractive than they were the first time around. But at least I had until my 20s before I had to start worrying about low-rise thongs and push-up bras. And at least, for that one sweet year, before Claire Daines got all sexxxeee and started dating Billy Crudup, I had Angela.

      I have been attempting to make coherent posts all day--about church this morning (I will definitely go back), about  Farenheit 9/11 , which Mark and I saw this evening (good way to spend the 4th, I'd say). But I'm just not in a coherent frame of mind, so it will all have to wait until tomorrow.  God I am happy to have an extra day off this weekend. Yay for rich white men who didn't want to pay their taxes...

       "Kathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping.  I'm empty and aching and I don't know why."  -America, Simon and Garfunkel  I'm making a mixed CD for the 4th of July. They were playing progressively patriotic songs on the radio on Friday, and it caught my attention. I'm opening it with the song quoted above, which is my favorite Simon and Garfunkel song and one of my favorite songs, period.  But I hear myself in it, and I hear current politics in it, and given that it's over 30 years old now, that makes me really sad. While I am not quite naive enough to believe in linear progress, either personally or nationally, I'd still like to see at least a few steps forward with my steps back, you know? And hard as I look, I'm not seeing much progress lately.   I know it's there--both in my own life and in the life of the nation and the world in which I live--but there is so much bullshit clouding my vision. So much terror. So much disappointment.  A bit ago, a friend of mine identified something in me that I've been aware of for awhile, but haven't had the energy or the guts to say aloud to myself. She said that I cling desperately to one thing, thinking that if I could just fix or figure out that one aspect of my life, everything else would fall into place. This is absolutely true. For awhile, it was "what do I want to do with my life?" More recently, it's been alternating between some sort of acceptance and embracing of my sexuality and finding God or faith or whatever you'd like to call it. I always feel as if I could just figure out that one thing, everything else would suddenly make sense. And frankly, it is so frightening as to be nearly incomprehensible for me to think that isn't the case. That I may find a faith community and still not fit everywhere else, for example, or that I could learn to accept and understand my own sexuality and that wouldn't magically fix any relationship problems I have. That I could ostensibly learn how to love without stings, like I wrote about yesterday, and still not everyone would love me back.  It's not something I even want to think about. I am lost without a goal. More accurately, I guess, I am lost without an obsession. I need to focus on something, to put all of my insecurities about everything else into that one thing. This probably isn't a healthy way to be.  But I'm so tired of trying to change.

       urlLink Frog  wrote an excellent post yesterday about "owning" all of the parts of yourself, even when other people (and perhaps you yourself) find them to be in opposition to one another. This is something I have been thinking about too. Part of it is reconciling my bisexuality for myself, since I seem to have to defend it to others all the goddamn time, but it goes deeper than that. There are a lot of things about me that seem...contradictory, I guess. And even if they don't seem that way to other people, or other people aren't aware of them, they seem that way to me, which may be more important.  I'm trying to think of an example that I would feel comfortable sharing here, but nothing is coming to mind. Most of the stuff is dumb anyway, and would seem trite if I were to actually publicize it. Or it's just too freaking embarrassing to live up to at the moment. My political views are pretty well aligned--I'm even getting kind of environmentalist in my old age. It's nothing so simple as to say "I'm a Christian Anarchist" or whatever. It's more personal stuff. It's how I interact with people. On one hand, I am insolent, uptight and generally unfriendly. I have an extremely difficult time making friends and people often just plain don't like me. On the other hand, the people I like, I fucking worship. And I make a real effort to treat them well. But that effort doesn't come without a price, because I often fear that what I see as "nice" or "generous" or "thoughtful" others might see as needy and pathetic. Which makes me insecure. Which makes me want to not bother.  It is very very important to me that the people I love know how much I love them, and I try to tell them as much as I can and in as many ways as I can. But I wonder sometimes if my methods are all wrong?  And when I get caught up in wondering that, I forget so show the people I love how much I love them, and then it is all a moot point anyway.  Basically, I want to be secure enough to not care how my love comes off. I want to be secure enough to make a phone call, send a letter, even give a hug. I want to be secure enough to give presents that are never returned or even acknowledged and not take it as a personal affront. I want to not care if I seem to give other people more than they give me. In fact, I WANT to give other people more  than they give me.  But on the flip side, I don't want to be walked on. I want to mean as much to the people in my life as they mean to me. And I don't know how to assure myself of that. They have to do that for me, and I don't know how to tell them I need it.   I guess it's not a small thing to ask to be able to love without reservation. In fact, it might be one of the biggest things I've ever asked for. But I think it's a noble goal all the same, and I'll see what I can do.  ***  In only slightly related matters, The Phoenix had me beating my head against the wall again today. I'm not impartial. I'm controlling. I play favorites. And on and on it goes. But you know what? I really TRY to be impartial and not play favorites. However, I have history with folks, and there is no way people who I trust aren't going to get the benefit of the doubt. I want to be fair, but I am not going to go out of my way to chastize my friends when they haven't done anything wrong just to prove nobody's the teacher's pet!   The whole thing makes me so goddamn angry I could scream. I put hours and hours per week into that space. Susan and I created it out of love, out of community. And more often than not, it seems, our faces (and especially my face) are spit in for it! I feel like I am supposed to be responsible without being in charge, and that just doens't fucking work. Yes, it is a community and yes, I want all members to be comfortable, but I am not going to lay down and be called a bitch just because someone needs to take their aggression out. I love the community, but not enough to be its fucking punching bag.  ***  In not-even-slightly-related news, I seem to be on a cleaning/organization binge. I made Mark help me with housecleaning this morning, and he actually ended up doing the bulk of it, which is excellent. I have been organizing like a madwoman since then, though. I wonder what it is in us that makes organization so appealing? I love lists, charts, things put into order. I guess it's pretty obvious that it's a control thing, huh? But is that necessarily bad?

      Being a well-conditioned American girl, and especially being one who not only does not wear a size 2 but NEVER has (it's true--I skipped straight from kids clothes to an adult 6 over the course of one summer), I hate my body most of the time. Just like I was taught to do. Just like my mom does, just like her mom does, ecetera.  Once in awhile, though, I don't. Just now when I was walking to Starbucks to get my full-fat full-sugar Frappacino (yeah, I know, I suck), I caught sight of myself in a window.  I am SO beautiful.   I have thick, strong legs and a big ole butt. I have wide shoulders and a strong, straight back. Even my increasingly-heavy breasts look strong and capable. I have big-ass feet, but they carry me and give me foundation. I have big-ass hands, but that just means they can hold a lot and I have a firm handshake. Even my hair looks strong.  I have spent most of my life wanting to be small, petite, tiny. Wanting to take up less space and be less capable. And I've just gotten bigger and bigger. I'm bigger now than I've ever been before, probably carrying 20 or so extra pounds around and pushing 6'0". My hips and ass seem to be still growing, as to my breasts. My upper arms look more like my mom's every year, and my mom looks like a blacksmith.  And, today at least, I'm OK with that. Today I am glad there is so much here, I am glad I take up so much space, and I think I take it up well.  Thanks to whomever for that. I really appreciate it.  (Thanks to William, about whom I haven't thought it months, for the title.)

      I thought the danger was past, but apparently I was wrong. I was so sure, I even gave in and put a couple of coats of "Oriental Red" (I know, what a horrible name) on my big toe when I did the rest of my toes on Sunday night.  The toenail is coming up now. Seriously. It is seperating from the toe and wiggling like a loose tooth. It doesn't hurt, but it's damn difficult to leave it alone. I feel like I should wiggle it out and then put it under my pillow and maybe the nasty smashed toenail fairy will come and leave me some money.  Probably not, though.

      As anyone who has been anywhere near me recently is undoubtably sick of hearing, I just read this really great book. It's called  Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls . Basically, a writer took the time to talk to a bunch of groups of elementary-to-high school aged girls about how and why they are mean to each other. Teaching girls not to be aggressive, the author postulates (and I think she's right), backfires into girls putting their aggressions into all of this underhanded, backbiting meanness. Rather than just getting in an argument or a even a fight and getting it over with, girls spread rumors, exclude, keep secrets, use particular kinds of body language, "kill with kindness," etc. And it causes psychological damage that haunts us for the rest of our lives, sometimes sutble ways, sometimes in clear-cut ones, like abusive romantic relationships, self injury, and eating disorders.  Every single fucking thing in the book rang true to me, both from the perspective of the aggressor and from the perspective of the victim. The thing is, it didn't just ring true to my childhood memories, but to my interactions with women now. The fear of exclusion and of being talked trash about, the cliquishness, the jealousy, and the searing, barely hidden anger that underlies it all--it's all still here, and I am not at all sure that I am reacting to it any differently at 25 than I did at 15, or even at 5.  If it's here for me, is it here for other women? Is it poisoning our relationships with each other? Most importantly, how can we get past it? Can we talk about it without falling too deep down a well of recrimination? Can we lay our feelings at each other's feet, bare ourselves, and still live to tell about it? Can we learn to trust each other?  I'm caught up in trying to figure out what the first step could possibly be. The truth is that I am terrified of women. The truth is that I want more than anything else in the world to be able to love and cherish and trust other women, to be a part of a sisterhood, but I don't. And every time I think I am getting close, I get burned worse than the time before. And I don't know how to stop it, I don't know how to fight my way through the layers of bullshit that lie between me and my sisters. I keep trying, because really, what else can I do, but frankly I'm losing hope. We were taught from birth to fear each other, to hate each other, and to keep all of our rage to ourselves until we could find a suitably "feminine" outlet for it. We were doing it in kindergarten, and in middle school, and we're doing it now. How do we unlearn that? Individually and collectively, how do we get past what we've become?

      It seems that maybe Mark  (and Chancey?) had a virus this weekend, in addition to the heavy drinkin'. I say this because now I'm sick, and I haven't been drinking at all. I feel awful. Queasy, headachy, can't keep anything down.  So much for my righteous anger.

      This was pretty much the weekend of vomit. First, I was awoken at 7:30am on Saturday by a barfing dog. Then I was awoken again right after I went to sleep Saturday night by a barfing Mark. And more times than I can count in the night and morning by a further barfing Mark. The dog I have sympathy for--who knows what his was due to. Mark, on the other hand, was throwing up due to four beers followed by what he characterizes as "six to eight" shots of vodka. My sympathy is limited.  I am tempted to post the picture I took of him last night, with his head in the toilet, but I guess I'm not that mad. :)  All of this added up to not a great weekend for me. I elected not to go to the party Mark went to Saturday night, and I had hoped to go to a movie this evening, but Mark is still pretty sick, so that didn't happen. I basically did laundry, dishes, etc. all weekend.  So I'm irritated. Not angry, really, just irritated. So it goes, I guess.
