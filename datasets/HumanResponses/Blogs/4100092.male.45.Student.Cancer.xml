      	The purpose of the site is to further the idea of the awakening of the human soul.  To best describe that experience I use the phrase a "reality epiphany".    	People often imagine the awakening of the soul as some gentle magical experience, when in fact it may be engulfed in conflict.  When the inner person is revealed it is often confusing to those who have known us, it is also confusing to us as well.  We may not have been real behind the facade however we at least were predictable.    	This conflict is the subject of the movie, The Matrix.  It is the realization that no matter how harsh reality may be, life behind the facade needs to be rejected.  We all must come to the truth.  In the movie "Neo's" has a conflicting conversation with a nemesis "Cypher".  Cypher was a member of Morpheus' crew, Cypher decides the life of a resistance fighter isn't all it's cracked up to be and engineers a deal to be reinserted back into the Matrix, at the expense of Zion.  He comments to "Neo", "I know what you are thinking, why oh why didn't you take the blue pill?"    	As shocking as this scene is I have asked myself that question a million times.  Having our eyes opened is no picnic, the pursuit of what is genuine is at times conflicted.  It was easier when I didn't know, I didn't see.    	My struggle continues, as I embrace the reality that for me there is no going back.  And so I end this post asking a question of you, "why didn't you take the blue pill?"

      Skeptics, got to love them.  For me it is the stuff that reassures me that there is intelligent life on the planet.  Most people don't like skeptics, they are labeled doubters, or scoffers.  They are perceived as trouble makers so their social life is not always as active as those who express extreme optimism.  I normally take issue with the label. Even though I am a skeptic it does not mean I do not believe in anything, nor does it mean I am not optimistic.  I am committed to what ever it is that I am convinced of.  I don't believe everything I read, or everything I hear. I think about it for a season and if it checks out I am sold.  This skepticism has saved me from spending useless dollars on stain removers, fat reducers, and puffed up politicians.  I am skeptical that the world can change all that much in four years. I am skeptical that any one person can be elected to an office and really pull off all that they promise.  I am skeptical that people are basically good.  I am skeptical that all rebels are evil and I am skeptical that compliance to every rule makes me a better person.  My skepticism has allowed me to find my place in this world.  It has allowed me to ask the right questions. It is through these questions that I have been able to see through the veil of fog that surrounds most people who refuse to see the truth even if it is screaming at them.  I would like to be skeptical of less, I simply think that with every new day I will discover something else to be skeptical of.  The good news of this is that with every new day I will also be convinced of something as well.   Victor Manning

      The Christian Bible quotes from Jesus these words "be careful how you hear".  This always stood out to me; I just like the way it sounds.  It implies that it is somehow detrimental to us if we hear wrong.  That leads to the conclusion that there is also a contrasting benefit if we hear then hear the right way.  This seems odd, mainly because it shouldn't matter at all how I hear anything.  I should hear it, get the chance to think about it.  If I like it I take it in, if not I reject it.  The responsibility You should watch what you say. It doesn't seem fair that I would be effected by something that you said?  To be effected because you said something out of context, or I inadvertently misunderstood what you intended.  However I have experienced it.  It is why I may shut a conversation down, or walk away from someone.  I bring it up because some of you have not learned that dynamic, you need to becareful how you hear things as well as what you say.  I see you ever day in the congregation of the 2000's, Starbucks arguing about what ever you philosophy might be.  You seem "hell bent" to convince me of what ever illusion may be suffering from, you can't let it go.  I know that as I write this most of you are imaging some born-again Christian on a soap box, but I am not intending it at all.  I have to hear from the Kerry"ites, the Bush"ites.  The Genome, black hole, political what ever.  What ever happened to "hi".   I just want a cup of coffee.  I think that we all like to be victims a little.  We are good at throwing stones but not as good at looking in mirrors.  People are not very nice to Christian's or others of strong convictions.  I witnessed a guy who was following this poor guy out to his car.  It seemed all the guy wanted was to wish the other a nice day, he said the most offensive words a man could hear, "God Bless You".  I would propose that part of the problem of having to argue is driven out of an out of balance defense mechanism.  I think that is connected to what I will call a spirit of offense.  It means I just have to fight about something.  This is the reason I am suggesting that we need to be careful what we hear, how we hear.  I don't need to be offended at what you said.  I don't have to slay every dragon.  I don't have to champion every cause.  My mom used to tell me becareful when arguing with stupid people, people watching may not be able to tell the difference.  I can live in peace.  I believe we can live at peace with God, live at peace with others and live with peace with ourselves.  Victor Manning

      I used to take 40 kids camping with me every summer.  It started out innocent enough.  As a kid growing up in inner city L.A. I did not have an opportunity to experience nature.  As a matter of fact the only campfire I ever experienced was standing around the trash cans they lit in the neighborhood.  There was this one time when I was about eleven-years old, but that involved a field, the fire-marshal's son, a book of matches and some youthful curiosity (which was a really bad combination); this most certainly is a story for another time.  For this camping trip we would take as many provisions as humanly possible.  Our truck would be so loaded down that we looked a little like the Beverly Hillbillies.  Even with all that stuff we would always invariably forget something.  It seemed no matter how prepared we were it was insufficient.  We were lacking in some way.  There are times when I am given to stress all that I do not have.  It is the nature of compelled humans to gripe, as much as it is in our DNA to live in a constant state of discontent.  The pressures of life seem close in and produce the same sensation as claustrophobia.  All the things we have to make our lives more convenient and yet none of them can deliver us from both what is inevitable and that which is really needed.  I have always laughed when I think of the analogy given by Douglas Adam's as he helped point to this conflict.  Douglas infers that all we really need in life is a towel.  In the story "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy he informs us that a towel is "about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have".  You can wrap it around you for warmth or wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat.  You can even wrap it around your head to ward off noxious fumes.  As Douglas Adams so poignantly puts it "any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, win through, and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with."  It is not silver or gold, nor car or plane, simply a towel.  This same idea that we don't know what is important can be seen in the scene from Steve Martin's "The Jerk".  In a despondent moment his character says "all I need is this chair".  These analogies help remind us that "what's happening" is often "not what's going on". There is more to it than meets the eye.  There is more happening around us, we easily lose perspective.  There is aneed to reclaim the right perspective in the process of awakening.    I am often asked why it is that I do not panic over deadlines.  Why it is that I seem to be able to look the most fiercest dog of the corporate world eye to eye with little fear.  Is it arrogance?  Is it a lack of intelligence?  It is an awareness that my most ardent adversary is simply human, he has no more power over me than I allow him.  I see that my most severe trial is only temporal.  I carry a keen awareness that "this will pass" and that I really have more than I need.  The nature of that awareness and the well of that provision is beyond me, it is most certainly relational.  I often speak to skeptics about this "luck" I seem to have.  If it is coincidence (and I think it more providence than not) than may I be on the right side of chance as much as I can.

      What this site is not is a Matrix fan site.  I want to avoid endless analogies to the Movie. I do not want to see you in your best "Neo" costume (as handsome as you might be).  The movie simply serves as basis for the subject.  As I stated in the first posting it the purpose of the site is to further the idea of the awakening of the human soul. If it is anything it is dedicated to the personal epiphany people can experience.  It is also meant to help people as they begin to walk that awakening out.  In my mind I am thinking of people who are in the process of redefining themselves.  They go to the barber a clean-cut icon of the American boy, they return with a Mohawk.  This is an outward expression of an inward change.  What they are expressing in doing something this radical is that they are different, or at least perceive themselves different. Understanding that is important.    Understanding that when something like this happens; the people that I am intimate with may have something to say about this.  I might lose my job, or even risk losing a relationship.  There are always risks when change is present.  This not to foster the myth that this conflict you experience is even worth it.  The analogy of Cypher in my earlier post was given to highlight the reality that what we experience may be painful, or even confusing.  We may lose sight of why we woke up in the first place.  This is rough and ugly but true none the less, if you are going to continue on the path of awakening then you must realize it will have it's own price tag.  Truth does not come in neat little packages.  You cannot expect that the truth will even meet you on your terms.  This is not something you can control.  When truth is presented (or in my weird view of the world, introduced) it is something I must react to, something I must acclimate toward.  Effort is made to synthesize it into my experience.  In this sense change is not a natural progression, or evolution but a discipline.  What has been your experience with the being made aware of truth?  What change did you have to make as a result?
