      I have always had a great love of science, there was a time in my life that I wanted to be an astronomer until my dad said "An astronomer there's no money in that" thanks dad for being supportive.  I excelled at math, because there were provable answers, and fought with my mom about religion, because there was to many unanswered questions. I would be a atheist, if I could figure out who made all of the shit that caused the big bang. Even then though, I would repeatedly ask how, so I wouldn't be an atheist or a believer. I guess sitting on the sidelines is where you'll find me.

      I watched amelie tonight for the first time, and though you think i didn't like it, i did i tell you. The scene at the end where she is baking, daydreaming of the man she is in love with, when he is standing outside the kitchen and runs his hands through the beads of the doorway and she hears the beads move for real, and turns around and sees it was just her cat who moved them... (and i felt her desperation hoping it was him and her despair when it wasn't)...but then the doorbell rings, filling you with hope that it might be him. I won't say what happens next because, you should really see this movie if you haven't.  I also find it pretty easy to relate to her when she was behind him in the cafe writing on the window trying to get his attention and when she does, she gets scared and runs off, only to write a note he might find, so she can try and get it right all over again (why does that sound familiar)  Its very good movie, with characters that i can relate to.  By the way you do like amelie, and she looks nothing like mj.                         xoxo

      When did everything lose its meaning...when did it all become work sleep work sleep repeat, i too don't think i can handle this cycle for much longer.  Im trying though, to live closer to the heart, to quit being afraid, to create something that has meaning in my life, to actually enjoy life.  So when i say you are not alone with your thoughts i truly mean it.   This song by Arcwelder (Finish my song)  sums up better than I could just what i'm feeling   When the night is turned to coal black And all I have are wounds in my back And I'm looking for a smile That will save me for awhile Now some will call it reckless To wear my heart like a necklace But it seems they'd never miss me And I want someone to kiss me Don't wanna be looking anymore Don't wanna be missing anymore I wanna have I wanna have  Finish my song  When I'm doing what I'm able And I choke under the label And I'm looking for a friend So it won't happen again Now they tie me to the desktop 'cause the cycle never will stop And I want to get away Live to fight another day Don't wanna be looking anymore Don't wanna be missing anymore I wanna have I wanna have  Finish my song

      I went to the racebannon show tonight, and Chuck D just for your info, they brought the noise.  Somehow my friend hector slept during the last half of their set.....i dont know, but before he fell asleep he asked me "whats up with everyone having the captain caveman hair" hahahaha. For those of you with the above mentioned captain caveman hair it was him who said it not me.  Good show, caught the act before racebannon but didnt catch their name, local two piece group with just a drummer and guitarist screaming his lungs out....good stuff. Saw part of right turn danger, it was past time to put hector to bed, but what i heard sounded good. Now i'm thinking of guitars, amps, a frequency generator and how i can combine all three. hmmmm.....

       Two days in a row i have scamed my way out of work early, but before i head out for the night, been thinking of friends and family with thanksgiving coming up.  Listened to the get up kids-holiday and it just made me feel how bad it sucks to miss people that meant something to you, but now are only memories. Here's to the friends that are still around and here's to the ones now that are only memories. Cheers

       "The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel"  So i picked up the new Wired magazine today, because i have a thing for technology especially all the new gadgets their coming up with. I'm sitting here reading the article about amazon.com building what amounts to a searchable online library in which you can see the pages of the book your searching for, this being the first step in creating a "Digital Great Library" where all books will be stored online.  For some reason that i cant quite nail down yet i'm fascinated by this idea.  It reminded me of something William Gibson said, but i cant remember his exact words. So i googled him to see if i can find it. No such luck, but i did find  urlLink this  . I really want to see that i say to myself. So once again back to google, and type in "no maps for these territories"  in hopes of finding it and downloading it. Nowhere to download it, but it is playing on the  urlLink indie film channel  hmmm.... i wonder if i get that channel, let me see. Holy shit i do, finally 500 channels and something will be on that's worth watching.

      Went to a hockey game tonight, saw about five fights, 40 shots on the opponents goal, and many kids dancing like fools to get on camera. I got there early to get a ticket so i could sit with my friend... no luck the seat next to him was taken. I get the closest ticket to him, which was a row up and three seats over. I have some time to kill because he hasn't left his house yet, and the game doesn't start for another half hour. So i walk inside the arena, and im greeted by the ticketman/slash security guard.  I hand him my ticket and because i was wearing one of those baggy hoddies with the one handwarmer pocket, he asks me what's in the pocket.... oh just my cellphone, and smokes i say...without even looking closer at my pocket or asking me to take the stuff out he say oh ok...i think if i would of told him its just some c4 and anthrax his answer would of been the same. If your going to bother asking me maybe you should make sure im not lying. So anyways, now i'm in with still a half an hour to kill...hmmm.... where's the bar, oh there it is. After showing two id's, i have the beer in hand. Sitting down in the bar area, i watch the tv, its showing a football game, it must have been a good game, because the people eyes sitting around me didn't move from the screen the whole time that i was sitting there. With the beer all gone and 15 minutes left before the game, i went to find the smoking area. I walked halfway around the arena before i found it. Its outside the arena fenced in so no one can sneak in to see a free event. I proceed to walk up to the door and a security guard says its closed... what its outside how is it closed i say to myself...The security guard who looks like he's in training to be this years Santa at the mall says "Its only open during intermission"... Me..."When is that"...Santa..."When their not playing hockey"...Me... "Well their not playing now"...Santa..."...."  Ok so i lost that battle, but for the price of some cotton candy i managed to get a seat next to my friend so im doing alright. Our section and another was picked for the pizza hut challenge, which is pretty much who can make the most noise during the game. The people in the winning section each get a free pizza. After three 20 min periods my throat is very sore, but at least i know what im having to eat tomorrow.

       "A man can't live for what he saves"  I was listening to the dismemberment plan-automatic, and that lyric hit me pretty hard.  While taking the lyric within the rest of the song, I believe he means you cant live for the memories you have, you can't go on living in the past.  Aside from what it means in the context of the song, by itself it also means to me you'll regret the things you wanted to do, but never did, because of some foolish reason that was all in your head. The words you wanted to say, the thoughts you wanted to get across, but didn't, because you weren't sure of how it would be taken by the other person. Its a reminder to me that the greater pain for me, is not the things that I have done, but the things I didn't do.  A man can't live for what he saves will be my mantra for the times when I feel vulnerable.   What does it mean to you?

       2+2=4  So its been 243 days since the start of the war in iraq and no weapons of mass destruction have been found. Our leaders go on the news and say that the war was never solely about finding iraqs WMDs, but before the war that's all you heard about, that and  possible  al-qaeda links that iraq might have. Now you don't hear WMDs mentioned on the news, but you still here about al-qaeda. We will continue to hear about al-qeada for the years to come when ever they need a scapegoat to justify their actions. To use the tragic events of sept 11th to propagate your agenda is sick, especially when you had this whole iraq war planned out before those events even transpired   urlLink see here ,  urlLink and here.  Now you want to censor the media coverage of our troops returning home in coffins-  urlLink read here . With all the media control, false wars, and the passing of patriot act it seems like the world pictured in  urlLink 1984  is becoming more of a reality with every day that passes. I still have hope though, we are not "the dead" yet, 2+2 will never equal 5.

          It snowed here in spokane the other day, just a few flakes here and there, but it was enough to get me daydreaming of Saturdays full of road trips to the mtns with all involved screaming there lungs out to what they think are, the lyrics to "new noise", Saturdays full of windy mtn tops overlooking miles of undiscovered thrills waiting to be experienced, Saturdays full of the calming rhythm of your board, as it floats on top untouched snow, Saturdays full of the walk out of the bone chilling cold and into a heartwarming smile of a rosey cheeked woman,   Saturdays full of us standing out in the cold, clear night sky, drinking warm alcohol, having a conversation of what it all means.       Sundays full of not being able to move from bed, Sundays full of being alone with a book and a cd as the world hurries by, Sundays full of remembering Saturday, Sundays full of looking forward to next Saturday.   So yeah, let it snow, let it snow,...let it snow

       Don't hand me that common courtesy line, if i don't take off my hat while eating. I want to know how you could   possibly be offended by me wearing a  hat . Really i do, because I find the whole matter rather absurd. Why don't you do us all a favor, and take your tired traditions and put them to sleep.

       Welcome to my hometown-The American Nightmare-    Most of  my waking hours today were spent playing Tony Hawk underground, while playing through the different cities, I couldn't help but think wouldn't it be neat if my hometown  urlLink youngstown  ohio was one of them. I thought of some things you could do while visiting youngstown.     - You could skate through the city, trying to lower the city's  urlLink murder rate    In doing so however, you would attract the attention of the mob, which runs the city, and would have to work for them if you ever wanted to skate again.      -There would be a goal dealing with running errands for our once Congressmen  urlLink Jim Traficant  while he's behind bars   - Another one would be doing the same for our former  urlLink Sheriff Phil Chance  who was found guilty of racketeering, and is also behind bars   Once you get those two completed you'll have the mob's money, which you can use to buy secret levels within y-town.                               -secret levels-      -The burned and decaying  urlLink amusement park        -The abandoned steel mill,  urlLink take your pick   While trying to find links for this entry, most of the ones I found were dead.....go figure.

      Some experiences replay in your head like your watching a movie. You go over and over the same scenes trying to find where you went wrong/the meaning that escaped you. You do all of this with the hope you'll get it right on the next take, because your getting sick of watching this clueless actor fuck up all his lines.

         A Metaphysical Musing   Have you ever felt a connection with someone that you couldn't quite explain, as if you could tune in the persons thoughts, like a radio tuning in a frequency. Say for instance you think of them and then they call a few seconds later. Now the first time this happens you brush it off as just a coincidence. When the second time comes around, you ponder the matter for a bit, but once again you tell yourself it was just a coincidence. After the third one hits, you start to question reality, more specifically you begin to question the actual limits of the human mind.

       Well today was noteworthy, only because of the painful absurdity of it all. I had the joy of going to work today.  I already work 40 hours a week so coming in on one of my few days off was bad enough. Oh, also i dont get paid for coming in on one of my few days off, gotta love that. Were having this big inspection next week and at the last minute they decide everything must be cleaned.  When i get there i find out that everything is done. The prior two shifts had cleaned it all (you guys rock). Instead of saying hey its all done we dont need you guys here, they say well its not really fair to the other shifts if you guys go home so go ahead and clean what they already cleaned just to make sure its good....what.  Yeah sure, we'll get right on that, so we proceeded to spent the next six hours driving laps around the flightline acting like we busy taking care of things. It was kinda like being in a nascar race, except that we were going only 15mph, and that there was no one racing us. Today would have been one of those days where you tell your boss to fuck off as you head for your car leaving that soul sucking job and never coming back. It would have been one of those days if I wasnt in the air force where they'll thrown you in prison for that kinda thing. Is it to much to ask, that if your going to make us come to work, at least have something for us to do. T minus ten months and counting till that day.   My job is shitier than your job...sing it

        You said you were going to send me a coffin, and in it a picture of you and him. You can kill it, and bury it six feet down, but I fear the ghosts will still haunt you my friend.   Does anything truly die in our heads? When all it takes is one hear that song, a single sight of that face, to bring it all back, knocking us off our feet.  And when it does, should you remember the times you shared, and look back and smile, or to feel sorrow, for those times you shared will never be had again.  I really don't know

       The last eight days were spent by, working 12 hours shifts, last minute christmas shopping that's still not all the way done, trying to get a hold of the police who have business hours...what?,  seeing just how long it does take me to get to work, by sleeping in later and later everyday, wondering how you see me through your eyes, then stopping that, not wanting to accept what I saw, realizing that I can't stand to drive at all without music. So much more could be said, but im going to keep it to myself instead.

       This is to the fuckers that broke into my car last night, may the cds you stole annoy the piss out of you so much that you get distracted and wrap your car around a telephone pole send you flying threw the windshield, where you can awake to see every scar from every shard of glass for everyday after in the mirror. May the snowboard boots you took, not fit just right for you and let them make you lose control, ending up with you smacking face first into a tree that will not break, and may the stereo you thieved and are going to pawn for your next fix, let that one be the one that does you in.........

      I went to see the Return of the King today, wasn't really planning on see it today, but it was a nice spur of the moment deal, I like when my friends don't let me sleep in, but not when they set a kitchen timer in my room.  I can see why the movie won the New York Film Critics Circle award for best film of the year.  The visuals are amazing(when the orcs bust down the door to the city, and you see what comes through...jawdropping) but its all just eye candy, the story is what makes it come to life. (its to late George, you fucked up). I have never been in a room with so many strangers that were openly weeping. The story may be fantasy, but its easy to put yourself characters place, because at sometime or another you have been there as well. Go see this movie, just don't expect to walk out of the theater happy though.

        America all is right, Walmart is still open   Just what do they have in walmart that warrants the need for 26 fucking video cameras viewing the parking lot. I mean really, god forbid someone walks off with a shopping cart, though it would be interesting to find out what would happen if one tried. I'm pretty sure I can out run the old man at the door, but im sure they have a plan for such an instance. I wonder if the crack walmart security team will come running wildly after me as I look back and laugh glee.

      I think I slept about 4 good hours since in the past three days, I tried to get friday off because a good friend was coming back from the gutter or Quater if you like, but alas I was needed at work, to sit and stare at the walls for eight hours.  I got off work about midnight and picked him up we drank till about 3 in the morning, which by itself isn't bad but we were waking up at 6am to go snowboarding. I was already in pain when the alarm clock went off but, snowboarding.....its a reason to wake up early in the morning, thus we got to the mtn as it opened.  The snow was like mother teresa, immaculate and forgiving.  Met up with some "internet friends", that's always a little weird, but had a good time non the less. We gave them a ride back down the mtn to their car, it had been snowing all day, had a good 4 inches on my car. I was asked "have you ever wrecked" me "no never but there's always a first time" her..."you just cursed us" me..."well you brought the subject up".  After 15 minutes of going down the mountain my car had eyes for this one guard rail, it wanted to get closer and closer to it. It almost hooked up with it, but at the last second I somehow was able to do the advanced physics calculation of the effect of pulling the ebrake while counter steering then hitting the gas would have on the ice covered road in all of about .5 nanoseconds. We were about an inch from hitting the guard rail but the calculation was right on, thus avoiding a couple thousand dollars in damages, and more importantly possible trips to the hospital, it was long way down if the rail gave way.  Sometimes fucking around in the snow pays off (see Nov 4th post). We made it back to my place without any further incidents. Once back here we both passed out, the previous night catching up to both of us. I woke up about two hours later and Christopher Walken was on the tv. Christopher Walken, he can hold my attention, so I watched the rest of the movie that was playing.  The Dead Zone was the name of it, really good movie, the ending wasn't the typical hollywood b.s.,  but then im a sucker for sad bastard shit be it movies, music, or books. I want to see the first half that I missed.    Today was spent trying to finish Christmas shopping, it didn't go so well, maybe I should figure out what to get before I even leave the house, because I spent most of the day trying not to buy things for myself. Almost got another tattoo, but decided not to just yet. I have an image in my head that I want to get, if only I could transfer it to paper, I'd be set.   Even though I a felt like a walking zombie, for most of it, the weekend was a nice change form the normal day in day out routine. Its good to have you back in town man.

       My roommate, insists on having mtv hits on when ever he's at his computer which is quite a bit. His computer is in the living room along with the tv, and the sound from the speakers must hit all the right angles and bounce off all the right walls, because it reaches my room and all of its annoying, bubble-gum flavor, is still intact, like its never been chewed before. So on this channel they have been playing, dashboard confessional-hands down every 45 minutes it seems, now I have this song stuck in my head, just when I think its ok, they play it again....arghghgh. The scary part is that im actually beginning to like that song.....Help!!!!!!

      The signal scrambled by the noise in my head and I lost the key to decipher you, now I can only guess what you really mean. A classified paper, words blacked out, the overall meaning missing. I fill the gaps with bits and pieces that I can recall, and even then, im back to the start with no clearer view.  And I hate that it is this way, and I know im guilty of doing the same to you.

      Jimmy Eat World- If you don't, don't  Have you ever listen to a song hundreds of times, then finally you hear it one day and its meaning hits you like a tidal wave. Its waters crash upon you bringing a flood of emotions. Its going to be on of those nights where sleep will escape me, my heart battling my head, battling my heart, in what is right. I thought I could bury it deep underground, but tonight i found out that was just a lie.

      I have to work this weekend 12 hours at a time for tonight, sunday and monday. I not so pissed that i have to work i've grown to accepted that as part of the b.s. but i know there will be nothing to do once im there. I really don't feel like watching any movies to pass the time, but im sure i will. There has been rumors of underground tunnels connecting different parts of the base, i found one of the grates last night at work. There was to many people around though to explore it any further. There will only be a handful of us this weekend, i'm thinking an Indiana Jones-core adventure needs to take place. Yeah this is going to be fun, im bringing my camera.    "You want to talk to God? Let's go see him together, I've got nothing better to do!"

      I really don't feel like going to sleep now, i want to go out and do something but its three in the morning. I tell myself that im going to wake up early tomorrow so i can go out and get some stuff done that i been putting off all week. Waking up at 10am is early for me, however it seems that's when i get the best sleep, right after my alarm clock goes off. I wakeup and a debate goes on in my head sleep or go to the store, going to the store only gets a word or two in before sleep over powers him and me. I didn't wake up today till 1pm and i think i could have slept for an other couple of hours. I really need to get on some kind of schedule that's somewhat productive.

      Schweitzer is having 4 dollar lift tickets this thursday, anyone feel like calling me in sick to work, i'll do the same for you...(if only i could do that, but its nice to pretend), doing the math in my head now if i can wake up, drive two hours, get to the mountain at 9, board till 1, and make it to work at 1500 hours or 3pm for you non military types. I think i can make it, however work that night will be super busy that im sure of, because it always turns out that way. When ever you feel like taking it easy, or you're feeling sick, that's when your the only person there who can get the umpteen (is that even word? ok Merriam-Webster's says it..cool) jobs done that are waiting for you. Oh no, you can't leave them for the next shift, like they were left for you, because someone is in your ear every goddamn minute asking is it done yet? No not yet i tell them. "How about this one?" Havent even looked at it yet. "OK well when you finish those two, there is this inspection that needs to get done, but it isnt due for another week, however we need to get it done tonight." Me with a blank stare trying to hold it all back-Why is that? Them "Blah Blah Blah Blah. Which translates to shut up and color. 294 days i tell myself....294 days.

       "At 350lbs she moved like she was a ballerina."  I was seventeen when this happened to me, and i cant get the image out of my head. Myself and my friend bob were walking in the mall, can't remember just what we where there for exactly, but it probably had something to do with dropping quarters in killer instinct gold, many quarters where dropped in that game. So we were walking from the arcade passing B. Doltons book shop on your way to  the pretzel shop i cant remember the name of the pretzel shop and its pissing me off right now, but back to the story. Turning the corner we were horrified to see  urlLink this man  with a mob of sweaty overweight mother types marching feverishly to his yells of self encouraging weight loss motivation. "Inside every fat person there is a skinny person dying to get out". He was only ten feet away from us, and getting closer every nano second, an uncontrollable fear gripped me at that very moment, i looked at bob and he looked at me, without speaking a word we knew what we had to do. We ran like kids, who had just broken the neighbors window seeking refuge  at the bookstore as he and his power walking horde trampled by. I sigh of relief was uttered between us. So the next time you go to the mall, be on the lookout and don't let your guard down, because  urlLink richard simmons   just might be there. You been warned.

      "Going in a circle never getting to the point"  Thank you Blake Schwarzenbach your lyrics have hit home so many times. It feels like all the aspects of my life are so true to that statement. And im getting dizzy.  I've been waiting for someone to fill the emptiness that I have inside. But im slowly realizing that no one can, its something that is going have to be done and must be done by myself. Only then will I feel that im not lost.  I brokedown a couple of weeks ago, but it showed me what I have to fix, that and reading a lot of taoism, things are becoming clearer. Im finding my balance, when for so long now i've been down on the ground.   "At birth all people are soft and yielding. At death they are hard and stiff. All green plants are tender and yielding. At death they are brittle and dry. When hard and rigid, We Consort with death When soft and flexible, We affirm greater life."                               (Tao Te Ching 76)

      I had this dream the other night, it wasn't last night, I didn't sleep at all last night. The dream was of me and you in a coffee shop and we were able to say everything that was going on in our heads and what we felt in our hearts, there was no fear and nothing was kept hidden between us, everything was put out in the open.  And it was the most beautiful thing that I have seen.

      I wish the man in your life was an asshole, but he seems like a decent guy, and I hope he makes you happy, because if he's not, that's just going to depress me even more.

      I work with this guy, he's about 40 or so and the military is all he has. He's past his 20 year mark meaning he can retire from all of this, but he stays around, because he has nothing else to do with his life. He likes to cause drama at the work place by being buddy buddy with you one minute, but the whole time he's waiting for you to cross this line, that only he has drawn in his own head and when you do cross that line, and you will, he'll use his power (number of stripes) over you, and will try to punish you somehow. I told him he needs to get out of the air force and direct his own soap opera...it would be something he's good at.  He followed this up with a blank stare, I know he put another entry about me in his secret database he keeps. Its really not to secret anymore because a couple of us found it one day, you shouldn't leave your computer logged on if you step out of the room. Im going to start calling him Tsgt Rommel because he acts just like a fucking nazi gestapo officer (you cant trust him one bit, you always wondering what his motives are) and the fact that he looks one of the german tank commanders from the movie Patton.  So wish me luck, as now i'm going to have to be dealing with him on a regular basis.   "Nazis....I hate these guys"      Name the movie and get a prize.

       The other night was Kung-Fu movie night starring Sonny Chiba in The Street Fighter (that music has to be in kill bill, it has to damnit, how come kill bill isn't playing in this town anymore...wtf). We made enough stir fry to feed a mongol horde. I really need to find out where that kendo place is in this city, that or some tai chi classes....I need something, something other then the same routine...blea.  Again, I bought way to many cds today.  I think I have some disease that makes me buy all these cds, but its one that I can live with.  So here's what I got for under 40 bucks.  The Red Hot Valentines-summer fling- and the self title one Planes Mistaken for Stars- self titled Unsane- The collection 1991-1998 (free dvd of their live shows, to bad none of the shows are from cleveland) Reggie and the Full Effect- Promotional copy- Greatest Hits Jawbox- For your own special sweetheart Smoking Popes- Born to quit  The Smoking Popes are my favorite band at moment.   "Turning, tossing and turning My love is burning me down"

      Were all on this journey, hoping to reach a destination, and its a journey without a map to give us any direction, so we walk around aimlessly trying to find our way.  When we think we found a path to get us there, sometimes it winds up being a dead end.  And what then, you have two choices turn around and wonder how you got lost or to keep moving forward hoping that the next path you run across will be the one that leads you there. I'll be taking my steps forward, because I still have many miles to go till I reach that destination.

      I built this damn to try to keep it  inside, and for a while it worked. Then slowly little cracks started forming in the in wall reminding me there was something there trying to get out, I tried to ignore it.  Then one day it all came  crashing down, spilling everything that was bottled up, and I choked on what it all meant, and what it said about me.

       Leatherface-Springtime  There's a little bit of springtime in the back of my mind, That remembers when there was a time when we danced and laughed an spent some time drinking wine, and somewhere in there, There's a little child without a thought, without a doubt that every cloud is silver lined. He is warm and everything is new, and everything is clean and everything is free and there were still so many things to see. So many things still left to be. You're a very small drop in the middle of a big sea of high and mighty things. Your fascination for larger than life, Your brand new appetite, as though we'd invented it. We danced. There's a little bit of springtime in the back of my mind, That remembers things, perhaps as they should've been, rather than lies, rather than the cruelty, That sometimes we were guilty of and as everyone knows, We were only young and really couldn't have known. We were very young and it's nice to know there's a place to go and still so many things left to see. You're a drop in the middle of a big sea of high and mighty things. Your fascination for larger than life, Your brand new appetite. As though we'd invented it. We danced. It could be the longest time and I'll remember it. You don't know what's in store, when we laugh.  The whole bike chain bracelet thing with us, is tripping me out now... to weird.

       I picked up Jawbreaker's Unfun today for 2 dollars at the pawn shop, unfortunately i didn't see any of my stolen goods. They caught two kids who are responsible for a series of break-ins of people cars and apartments the other week, and they only lived a street up from me, so i called the cops to see if they had a list of recovered items....nope not yet, and he (Mr police man) said well even if we do recover any of your items they are going to be held as evidence, and you wont be getting them back till after the court date... outfuckingstanding, so after a year i  might  get my stuff back that they  might  have recovered...awesome. Anyways the reason we were at the out and about was that my roommate wanted to go get a dresser  (the ball of clothes on the floor needs a home) I suggested we go to a thrift store and get one for cheap since rent is due soon, but instead we ended up at an antique store, ummm yeah ok... not really going to find a cheap one there but whatever.  Looking through all the old books and magazine there, I picked up this science fiction magazine from 1949 and on the cover is a drawing of a robot/tin man looking thing with an a pinned on paper heart looking up at the night sky...rad. For a while i was that robot just going through the motions of day to day not feeling anything, what a waste of a way to live. You don't experience any pain but you don't experience any true joy either. You hold nothing close to you. I can't live like that, i cant watch the rust form and wonder what happened, when did everything pass me by with it being to late to do anything about it. Im just glad a change did occur, that my heart was thawed.  I cant say its a pleasant feeling right now, because i have experienced true happiness and peace, but its gone, and so now i too look into the night sky searching for it again.

I cant tell exactly what's different, but everything now is seen in a new light and it was a long time coming, maybe its my heart and finally catching up with my head, and im going to let it run for a while and see where it takes me. That's all, happy new year!

      Tomorrow at this time I will be 35,000 feet above the north pole on my way to Germany, I wish that was the last stop but its only an overnight stay on way to the "gutter" Or a country in the middle east with a  similar sounding name anyway. At least they have an applebee's off base (insert sarcasm) its funny how our corporation's can infiltrated and set roots in a country far better then any special forces team could ever hope to....We are the new roman empire and cd's are the arrows we shoot. I was in Turkey about two years ago and had the chance to swim in the Mediterranean sea...at the beaches I was expecting to see and hear some of the Turkish culture but all that was seen and heard was nike logo's on the people's backs and britney spears songs on the speakers. There was a man who swore he was tupac, hailing from nyc. It was pretty depressing. Will Qatar be any different, I really doubt it.  Give it an other ten years and all those countries will be U.S. territories in one way or an other....suck them dry...Can it be any other way, maybe it could but its to late now. Gas prices will continue to rise, people will continue to die,  so drive that SUV to the store and say you are against war, as long as you can drive to the mall and buy the newest and latest gadget for almost wholesale price, but who gives a fuck about what going on in some other country ,when you cant even place that country on a map.  I think it was Noam Chomsky who said this country would be ok if we as a nation spent as much time trying to memorize and take in major league sport scores as we do international politics, or just national politics for that matter.  That's how they want it they though, apathy is the only way they can run the country as they see fit.  Why is it that you don't see stickers saying "Fight terrorism, ride a bike" from the government, instead its the line, you smoke pot, then you're supporting the terrorists, and where do the terrorist get more funds from....oil or weed....I wonder. I really need a new job.  Goodnight,  My next post will be from the land of 1600 shades of brown, maybe, it all depends.   Take care, to all who read this.

      Saw  urlLink defiance ohio   last night they played for about 4 people at a coffee shop. There's such an energy behind there music, its raw sounding but you don't need any distortion, or effect pedals when the music comes from the heart....so much passion behind everyword. Some people are born with old souls, and they are a few of the ones that were.   Found out last night the Pixies are playing in spokane, but as my luck goes when ever I leave spokane for a while is when it decides to get somewhat decent here, it happens everytime. So I'll miss Henry Rollins and the Pixies and im sure that wont be the only things I'll miss when im gone its just the only thing I know about right now.  " I'll say goodbye in hopes to never mean it "

      I got a call from my friend the other day, he told me he was trying to leave this place to. It kinda depressed me that he was leaving, but im leaving here to in the not to distant future as well, it shook me up a bit, because I really don't think about it that much, or rather I don't want to think about it that much. It's never fun to leave people behind that mean so much to you. And we'll try and make our friendship last, but its so easy to let people slip away, to let them fade into only memories. The fellowship is breaking up. While leaving here and living somewhere else is something I want to do, its the saying of goodbye that is going to make it tough.

      I took a nap tonight before going into work, but I didn't need to because I didn't have to work tonight but of course I didn't find that out until I got there. Anyways, I turned on the radio to quiet all the noise in my head, and there was some right-wing christian lady on the radio talking about terrorism and terrorist and whatnot. She was upset that were talking all these measures to make our planes safer something about retinal scanners at airports and other such measures to try and stop them. She had a point that its all pretty useless, that they'll just find some way around it. She just wants to see them"eradicated" to find and destroy them like insects, I guess that's how most of this country feels. But all of that is similar to getting sick and taking medicine for it. You can cure the symptoms of the cold but until you realize why you got sick and do something about it, its just going to happen again. For every bomb we drop that misses its target and kills a child, a mother, a father, and it leaves someone in the wake to mourn them, how are we going to stop terrorism, because didn't we just give someone a reason to fly a plane into one of our buildings. We need to look at what we do as a nation that causes the people around the world to hate us with such a passion. Once we realize why they hate us, maybe then can we change our ways and stop getting sick.

       I remember a time I listened to music because I just liked the way it sounded.  ...I am so fuckin emo...    After the other night, Refused "the new noise" is now banned from being played in my room if there is more then two people in it.  How come we don't start a band, really what is holding us back besides instruments and musical ability, the passion is there though.

       Lessons of the Heart  by Glenn J. Morris  Love is learned, it cannot be taught  You can be loving, and lovely is in the eye as seen by the lover You can be a lover to those who love you Without loving them, but it is hard It requires discipline; its a job; it gets old It deadens the soul and the soul is the heart And the heart hardens and forgets  You can love those who don't love you But the service is empty The devotion is wasted And if the loved one is callous or cruel It wounds the soul and the soul is the heart And the heart hardens and forgets  You can love  with a small "l" as small "l" love is better than no love But it requires being false to your self Which isn't all bad You learn to live with other people But the soul doesn't grow And the soul is the heart And the heart withers and forgets  You can live with a handicapped heart mistaking dependence for devotion, approval for love You can try to force yourself to forget what it is to be complete Put your passion into your work Or material status/wealth/muscles/whatever So the soul doesn't forget passion And the soul is the heart  And the heart hungers and almost forgets  You can find with electric recongnition the love of your soul Soul mate Who feels you at a distance Whose touch electrifies your blood Whose eyes hold you looked Whose voice delights your ears Whose laughter awakens your heart Awakens the heart And the soul is the heart And the heart softens And will not  WILL NOT FORGET.

      My body is broken, two days of straight snowboarding and now I feel like I need a tailbone replacement.  The pain from that is working its way up to my head. The agenda for tonight is, a bath, drink some whiskey, put on some john coltrane....and sleep.   On an other note I pissed of my roommate this morning, he cant take a joke, and he's probably not going to be talking to me for a while, I had roommates that were friends before and there was no problems, but this shit is stupid, quit acting like a little 5 year old, don't you see that the deeper you dig this hole the harder its going to be to get out of. But maybe you don't want to get out of that hole, because your acting like you don't, and I try to offer you I hand out of it, but you rather play your game. There's going to be one day when I quit trying, when I just don't give a fuck anymore. If you want to be a roommate and nothing more, so be it.

      When did this happen, when did you become more then a friend to me in my heart. I don't know, if I can go back to the way it was. If I can just be your friend. Because it just going to resurface all these feelings that I do have for you. My love for you is going to tear us apart..... I wish ourselves the best.

      I think I slept most of yesterday, really I think I slept like 20 hours off and on. I think it was a combination getting sick, a hangover, the sledding riding behind a truck, I'm still sore from that, trying to figure out why you have to so goddamn mysterious with me, deciding that its best to shut the door for now, so I can breath, so I can see, trying to kill my ego, wishing life was like a math problem because no matter what it was you could find a way to work things out, seeing it through your eyes, feeling how you are torn, knowing that im causing you pain, realizing that im being selfish, wishing there was a way for our love to fit.

      Weekend- MTV cribs style video of my apartment, waking up to an amp being plugged in "its Saturday...Saturday, going boarding on a Saturday", snowboarding, watching friend faceplant from his first jump, watching friend getting pulled down the mtn by ski patrol in a sled. Taking friend to the emergency room, finding out all is good, its just a bloodied(is this word?) nose. Watching the Last Samurai, thinking if there is such a thing as having past lives then I must have been from ancient Japan or China, because it would sure explain a lot. Sleeping on someone's floor, waking up to a sore back...wishing the snow would of fell on Saturday, having a meaningful conversation on the phone, talking a cat nap, writing this, having to work tonight, wishing the nap was longer.    Did you see that superbowl....yeah neither did I.

      The days blend into one faded memory, I don't know what day it is monday, sunday, thursday I really don't know, not like it matters anyway, its better to be lost, then to count down the days. The closer you get to leaving, time slows down and the days grow unforgivingly longer. It's the little things you take for granted, that start to bug you...eating what and when you want, not having to get fully dressed to take a piss in the middle of the night because the bathroom is about 50 yards away. I miss just jumping in my car and going for a drive down an unfamiliar street. I'm up at night around 3am here sitting outside smoking and the should be silence of the night sky is filled by the screams of fighter jets taking off, their afterburners propelling them up, like a star that was called back into the heavens. Its easy to get caught up in the bleakness of the desert, when you look out all around you and see nothing but sand...no trees, no mountains, no animals, no birds in the sky... life is not meant to be here.  Books help to fill the void of the landscape, I thought five books would be enough to keep me occupied....I was wrong. I went through those in the first two weeks I was here.  There is a Barnes and Noble just five minutes away from my apartment in spokane, and now the closest one to me has to be a couple of thousand miles away......

      There's something in the air over here, maybe the sand, or it could be the that's about 90 plus degrees during the day and 50 degrees at night, possibly its the in and out of the air conditioning,  its something over here that has me sick. I'm Hoping that if I sleep for sixteen hours today it might help, but it happens everytime I go overseas. I was going to post one of those questionnaire things my friend send me but the email is not working on this computer and blogger is blocked on the other computer. So anyways I'll make up my own list of questions, it'll give me something to do today if sleep doesn't happen, which it probably wont.  Here's my email add over here   Nicholas.Necastro@auab.aorcentaf.af.mil   write me.... I'll send you a my questionnaire to fill out, I really don't care if I have never met you before, if your reading this send me an email. Time seems to stand still over here and it helps to have reminders that there's an actual civilization out there where everthing isn't brown, and the air doesn't smell like feces and piss.

      So I finally made it here to the gutter, and it does live up to its name. Stopped in Germany for what was supposed to be an overnight stay, but it turned into a five night visit. The reason for this being is when a jet lands, it should land with the back landing gear touching down first and it should stay on the ground until enough speed is lost and then the nose landing gear should then touch down....that is a good landing. Now picture someone skipping a stone across a pond...the stone hits then bounces, hits, bounces and so on...when you do this landing a plane stuff tends to break. We finally come to a stop at the end of the runway, and the crew starts taking panels off the avionics equipment rack.... wtf are they doing im asking myself...I don't like the crew touching the equipment I work on, they know how to fly the plane but are pretty clueless on how to fix them.  When the panels come off smoke is coming out of the equipment rack.....you don't want to see smoke anywhere on the jet,  especially when the jet is a tanker with an landing loud of close to 40,000 pounds of jet fuel, but there was smoke there and to make it worse it was in the avionics equipment area, so even if we didn't blow up, I was going to have a lot of work to do...screwed both ways.  When Captain "I don't know where the runway is" bounced the jet across the runway, the cooling fan for the electronics equipment seized up, causing the motor to burn out. Luckily that was all that was wrong causing the smoke. Waited a couple of days for parts to come in , while waiting went to a German castle, watched some  german tv, listened to some really bad german industrial music, explored a small german town looking for a german pub, drank some german beer (which is overrated). Now that im here in the "gutter" Germany is looking really good and im wanting to go back. I been here for about 3 days now, and I don't have any email yet, cant get on to any computers, my bed attacks me everytime I turn (a spring right in the rib), I just got a bunkmate in my tent my room which is the size of a closet, the only computers I have access to this site is from a British morale tent like 2 miles from my own tent, but im sure they'll block this site for some reason.  But until they do, I'll keep the posts coming from this casbah.

        He stared at the ceiling, while shirty thoughts hammered away at his conscience.    Its about time that I quit smoking, expect my posts to be a  bit  (insert sarcasm there) more choleric in nature for a while... i.e. more pissed off, angry, heated, irate, ireful, mad, shirty, waxy, wrathful, wroth.     Am I the only one who has never heard of shirty, waxy, and worth before. Is shirty really the right word to get a crossed that you are angry at something. It just doesn't have the same punch as say, wrathful carries.

      I should be sleeping now, going on a roadtrip tomorrow... my friends are all passed out on the couch, but yet I sit here. I read all of my earlier posts, I guess im feeling kinda reminiscent right now,  I read through them all remembering exactly how I felt when I wrote each of them. When did six months become to feel like two weeks? The past year has been very enlightening for me... I used to think that once you hit a certain age you stopped growing as a person...but now I know that you never will, you'll always have a new emotion that catches you off guard, a new pain to go through, a new joy to experience, you'll be confused, and then think you have it all figured out, only to be lost again. To all of you, I raise my glass to getting older but never growing old in the heart.

I haven't done a damn thing this whole week, I can't say I like my job, but there is some satisfaction to be had, in fixing something that is broken. I feel so dead inside when I walk in those doors, I sit in the parking lot at times and think, I should start my car up and drive....and keep on driving. Bring on the unknown, I don't want to know whats going to happen next, I want anything but the routine, I want to feel alive.

        Rocked with Gina Gershon....?    Flipping through the channels today I witnessed this documentary urlLink  Rocked with Gina Gershon . Its a six part series of her touring, fronting a band across americia in support of her movie. Now the movie has nothing to do with the band she is touring with...but she's on tour anyway, ummm ok. The band backing her up are the members of  urlLink Girls Against Boys . After watching this documentary I came to these conclusions.   1. Girls Against Boys = Rock  2. Gina Gershon = Does not rock  3. Gina Gershon and Girls Against Boys = Rocks only if you substitute Gina Gershon for Eli Janney

      Had this dream the other day maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, I was at work, it was sometime in the late afternoon. I was pacing the up and down the hallways trying to kill some time when I looked out one of the windows. What my eyes saw were three tornados weaving back and forth on there path straight towards the building I was in. I don't remember much after that. So Friday around four o'clock I was at work when over the radio came the announcement that there was a report of lightning within five miles of the base.  Lightning is not good, when you work on a airplane with a metal skeleton. So everyone leaves the flightline and comes inside to avoid possible electrocution. An other five minutes go by and we here the hail start failing. Being from the Midwest I seen my fair share of violent storms and this one was getting pretty angry. Then the report of a funnel cloud spotted north of the runway came over the radio. So what does everyone do? Of course we all rush to the windows and doors to see if we can spot it. About a minute later the radio says in a shaky voice two tornados have touched down on base...seek shelter. No damage was done by the said tornados. I'm just finding it rather eerie that I dreamt of tornados while at work and a few days later that dream came true. Wtf is that all about? Why cant some more uplifting dreams I've had come true, why that one. Feeling kinda cheated....

      Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid due out this summer. Now if any of you have seen the first Anaconda movie, you know that this movie was a piece of shit.  But it seems someone had the brilliant idea to make a sequel, and some studio head bought off on this idea. Im sure it went down like this..... ok the first anaconda movie made x amount of money...but that was only with one snake guys.... now you take that formula where x is amount of money the first one made times 1 snake = amount of profits...now with the second movie hence the name Anacondas we have this formula x times 2 snakes= 2amounts of profits, what do you say guys looks good huh. The very sad things is someone actual fell for this idea and went ahead and gave the greenlight to this movie. I'm sure people will go out and see this movie, but have you heard of the police stings where they lure people with warrants in by saying they won a free vacation and once the people show up to collect their prize they're taken to jail. This is how that movie should work, once people by tickets for this film, they should be taken into a back room where they are seated down and then told there are being deported. They'll wonder what's going on, and someone well tell them " I'm sorry sir that was a test and you just failed we have deemed you  (borrowing someone else's term here) "intellectually inept".

Gee angel, gee angel, I need some slack There's nothing in this world that I'd rather do Than buy a set of wings and fly away with you  Climbed up the mountain, observed the view But angel wouldn't say what I had to do Then angel flew away and left me standing there I knew I couldn't fly, but I didn't care

      I need some new habits because the old ones just aint cutting it anymore. My life seems likes its on hold, while I wait for my time to be up here. The things you want the most are the same things that keep you up at night. Holding onto some hopes at times is like drinking a poison that slowly consumes you until it rots your head. Some dreams are better left to let die, because at the end of the day we all want that dream to materialize into something that's real, that you can feel and hold onto. Im getting tried of waking up to disappointments.

      8000 miles and I'm home, still part of me is trying to catch up to myself....."soul delay".....its some where over the Atlantic, floating ever so slowly back here.  12 hours in a plane can feel like a lifetime when the sleeping pills you take don't have the desired effect.  That was friday, the weekend was a trip to Seattle which took 13 hours roundtrip....we took the scenic route...Bruce Lee's gravesite, singles going steady, an oak harbor beach, one decent cop, the university district, many near car crashes, a hilarious walk back to the hotel after some sushi/a mad dash for others, a "slightly" bald tire, and the Weakerthans-Plea from a cat named virtue.   "All you ever want to do is drink and watch TV Frankly that thing doesn’t really interest me I swear I’m going to bite you hard And taste your tinny blood If you don’t stop the self-defeating lies you’ve been repeating Since the day you brought me home  I know you’re strong."

      I should be in bed sleeping right now, but sleep isn't like a light switch that I can turn off and on. So yeah I have to be getting up at 6am to go to school, but I just got off work an hour ago and im wired, to much pepsi in the blood. Hopefully I'll only have to put up with this routine for another couple of weeks, until im done with work. Anyways today was my first day and why is it that in every class there always the one guy who asks every intellectually deficient question that enters his head. If he could just let the teacher finish explaining the example on the board, then maybe he wouldn't come off a such a tool, but he just cant keep his mouth shut. "What does that circle around the equation mean?" The teacher "....."  What the teacher wanted to say "Hey man that circle means. Hey you, pay the fuck attention to this, this here, this stuff in the middle the circle, its important enough that I circled it, so you won't miss it, hence the circle, got it."

      Took a math placement test the other day, thinking about going into some type of engineering field, and found out I do math at a 9th grade level....outfuckingstanding, but you gotta start somewhere just sucks that the place where im starting is somewhere I've already been.    So today one of the people I work with, brought in this astrology book with all of the days of the year in it, what you do is find your birthday and that page tells you about yourself......fucking creepy that page was right on for me, well except for the part where it said that I need to watch what I eat because I have the habit of gaining weight easily (haha), well everything else was dead on except that part...really it was. According to the book my strong traits are that I'm purposeful, and influential, and my weaknesses are that I'm self-unaware and self-involved. I can see all of those.  Work was ok today, mainly in part because we had none, instead I spent my time reading a  urlLink found magazine ,  urlLink Survivor , and listening to  urlLink KEXP     urlLink

I won't be surprised if they try, and make me take it off my car, but there comes a certain amount of freedom when I know my days here are numbered.

      Why go to the mall and pay 30 dollars for shorts when you can go to value village and make your own for 3 bucks. So that's what I did. Then I got one the internet and decided to spend some more money. Bought some stuff from this  urlLink place , then looking at my backpack which was once black, but now is mostly brown (one to many trips to the desert) went to amazon.com and got a new one. Of course since im already going to be paying shipping why not get some cds I say to myself,and purchase  urlLink this ,  urlLink this , and  urlLink that . You can find more of that  urlLink here .

      Doesn't it seem that everything is picking up pace, as in the whole world, all of society is in this race, everything is becoming quicker, faster, more instant. But where is this all leading to? Looking back say 50 years ago did kids have A.D.D. or was that disease brought on by technology and our current way of life? It just seems we are headed for this massive crash, where there will be to much information, to much noise assaulting us on a daily basis. In the book Lullaby, Chuck Palahniuk makes a point in comparing the world envisioned in 1984 to our current world. The world in 1984 was one where people were always silent, afraid to speak out because there were thought police always watching them and listening in, and if they said something against the status quo they were taken away never to be heard of again. Our world is one filled with this ever increasing static of meaningless garbage, its a new distraction every 30 seconds, but in the end it serves the same purpose as the thought police did. Instead of trying to controlling our thoughts, they just keep us from thinking. As long us we are entertained, we will stay quite, remain docile, and most importantly the status quo will remain the same.

       Are you staring at the ground through blackened eyes? Are things better, or is it more of the same?  I wanted to call, and ask you these things, but that thought faded. Faded like pictures kept in a shoebox. Over time all that will be left is the faded pictures in a shoebox and the feelings that don't fit. I just hope your doing ok.

      The world in itself is black and white. The grey area's are created by those who are looking for excuses to dodge excellence.&nbsp;Not my&nbsp;statement but here's my take on it.   Those who see the world as black and white are looking for other people standards to measure their own existence against. Those who see the world as grey realize that not every situation&nbsp;can be&nbsp;to boiled down to right and wrong, because its all relative to&nbsp;the persons situation at hand. They are not looking for a&nbsp;scapegoat to dodge excellence, they just&nbsp;choose their own meaning of success.&nbsp;

      Friday was my last day at work, I avoided getting tackled and tied up to a chair, thus escaped the flour and eggs and sour milk they had waiting for me in the fridge. That was their last chance to get me, for I'll never walk through those doors again. Some of the people will be missed but&nbsp;the majority of them are still the&nbsp;closed minded assholes as they were the first day I met them.&nbsp; So now I'm jobless but still getting a pay check&nbsp;till the end of September, so that means I have all kinds of freetime on my hands.&nbsp;I really don't like all this freetime, I like to keep busy.&nbsp; School takes up my morning, but its only two classes and im done at around 11, with not much homework in either class. Since im taking a music class, and learning some basics of music theory even though its an intro class, the professor likes to go overboard on some of the subjects. I decided to get one of  urlLink these  and&nbsp;my make&nbsp;learning how to play it&nbsp;my new hobby.&nbsp; Speaking of music even though  urlLink Underoath  is a christian band their new cd is really good much more melodic then their earlier stuff,&nbsp;but I&nbsp;really want&nbsp;to&nbsp;here the cd from the  urlLink Decahedron . Someone said music is like a drug, I know its true because I got a pretty expensive habit.

      Went to the warp tour over the weekend its probably the last one I'll go to since I'll be living in seattle and will&nbsp;actually get to see shows and not have them cancel, 30 minute sets of the two bands I wanted to see really didn't cut it, it was more like a tease.&nbsp; Thursday was amazing but for only 30 minutes, and Alkaline Trio rocked but for only 30 minutes.&nbsp;  urlLink Vaux&nbsp; &nbsp;played two sets which is good because they remind me of Helmet and I missed the first set.&nbsp; Ima Robot was another one that was good, good because they didn't sound like any of the other bands playing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I spent&nbsp;an equal amount of&nbsp;time looking for people&nbsp;as I did&nbsp;watching bands. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;In other news there's a small chance that I might have skin cancer, I guess its really not all that surprising when you have&nbsp;spend close to nine months in the desert sun. Its just coming&nbsp;at a bad time, not going to have any medical insurance in 70 days, guess I'll see what happens.&nbsp;haven't smoked any cigarette's in a 24 hour period, and im hating it, but its usually at the&nbsp;day three when I&nbsp;break down and smoke one.  &nbsp;  Watched this really informative movie called the weathermen underground, its about a group of students in the 70's who tried to overthrow the US government,&nbsp;&nbsp;it was kinda depressing because after all there actions they didn't change a goddamn thing. American or Amerikian (as some people say) people&nbsp;&nbsp; are just&nbsp;to dumb to have an revolution. I mean there a good chance Bush&nbsp;might get reelected what more can you say.&nbsp;Love it or leave it you're not the only one who's seriously thinking about leaving it Steve. How does the Canadian national anthem go.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        "Your asshole is just the far end of your mouth"    Went to the  urlLink Chuck Palaniuk , book signing. There had to be close to 500 people there, pretty crazy for that many people to be at a event in spokane that doesn't involve a ball of some sort. He read a short story called Guts, during his tour so far he said 43 people passed out from the story. The story deals with three people horrific tales of jacking off. It was the most obscene and vulgar thing I've ever heard in public...it was great. And after the reading the body count was up to 45. The majority of people who passed out were guys he said. The stories involved a piece of candle wax, a carrot, and a pool pump. He tells us later that all of the stories are true...Ouch.... He also said that survivors and choke are being made into movies, and that fight club is going to be a Broadway musical...ha.

      I've just spent four hours studying for a math test tomorrow that I'll most likely fail, its not that the material is hard its more due to the fact that the class is at 7am and I hate alarm clocks. So I've missed class 4 of the 6 classes this past week because I cant pull myself out of bed. Went to Seattle again this weekend, found out where I want to live and got some really good pictures of the downtown skyline at night, and got let down with certain people actions. I'm losing my faith in the human race and the way we treat each other, its pretty fucking disgusting. I'm feel like I'm one of the few people who actually think about others feelings before I think about my own when I do something. I'm just really disappointed in people.
