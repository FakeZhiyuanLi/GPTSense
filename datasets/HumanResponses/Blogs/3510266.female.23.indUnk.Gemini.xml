       I love how boys sound so sincere and so nice to you when you first meet them. They tell you how they are different from the other guys and then 2 days later they become just like every other guy you've ever met. They don't remember the conversation you just had the other night when they were drunk and all the things they said that made you melt even though they claimed drunkenly at the time, "No I won't forget this I'm not like that. No, no I've never said these things to anyone else...(blah, blah, BLAH I'M A LYING BASTARD!!!!!)" Sorry, I got a little excited there.   I can't believe these stupid boys turned me into a total chick! All I do is sit around talking to my friends about boys this boys that. "Oh he's so cute. He did the cutest thing! He said something so sweet! He called me! He hasn't called me! Why won't he call me!!?? He's not like the other boys! He's just like every boy! Grrrrr!!!"  I think I need a map of all the stupid boys' houses in the city so I can hatch an evil plan to bomb all their houses. After all I am Iraqi. It's my job. I will be doing it for the good of woman kind. I think it is my true calling. That's it!! I have found my purpose in this life finally!!! Mwahaahaaaaaaa!!!

      Ok it's official, I am now a fatherless child.  Today was the day that my father and I ended our relationship, and I think I am ok with that, but it's nothing I want to go into detail about, at least not for now.

      Once again I have been sucked into the world of boys. Well, one boy in particular. He tells me again that he wants to hang out with me because I'm "good company" . So I agree to go out with him last night. I was initially supposed to pick him up at work but then he had band practice so he said he'd meet me at the bar after. (jeanine says this whole band practice thing is a red flag because she's soured on musicians from past experience, but she likes him)  Anyway, I go meet up with a couple of my friends, Joel and Jessica, for dinner. Then we head to the bar and find out shortly after that HE IS NOT COMING!! He was stuck in Summerlin or some shit and he has no car. He was apologetic but I couldn't help being pissed off. I would never have even gone out if it wasn't his idea. I could have been sleeping. But I ended up staying at the bar playing drunk pool with Joel, Jessica, and Anthony til about 3 am so it wasn't all bad. Anthony is good at making people feel better. I totally love that guy.  (he's my favorite..=)) I know I shouldn't take his canceling personally cause he does it to everyone but I just don't know if I should even bother to agree to going out with him again if I'm just going to get stood up. Well, I said I wanted a normal boy. And we all know boys are jackasses anyway. So maybe I finally found him. More as the story unfolds...

      Ok so Friday was my birthday. Jeanine spoiled me rotten. She bought me a fossil watch, and floor tickets to see our favorit band Incubus, and her step-mom bought me a fossil bracelet. We went to the bar again as we always do and did the same thing again as we always do..lol anyways so again I think I hae been suckered in the boys world. I have once again melted to a boy's words and actions, so I know I am setting myself up for a huge fall, but at least im prepared. I'll keep everyone posted on what happens with the (BOY)
