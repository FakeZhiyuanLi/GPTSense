      so here i am...halftime of game 2 of the finals.  The Lakers seem to be irritating the Pistons and causing defensive problems for them.  I hope the Lakers lose, i really don't like them, and that Kobe, he's so smug--i hope he gets convicted.  Anyways, i'm in charge of the house again, my brother went over to his "girlfriend"'s house and probably won't be back.  As for Jacob, who knows, i haven't seen him in a week or so.  I need a hobby or something man, i get so bored.  And food, boy have i ran out of ideas of food to eat, makes me kinda wish i was at home and didn't have to buy my own food and didn't have to think about the meals i have to make.  It's nice to live in the city and be semi-independent, but it feels like i'm missing something...maybe i'll go start on the server.  now that i have the software to do it i think it'll be pretty cool to have a server set up for the house.  I know it's not necessary but it might be fun and i might even learn a few things along the way

      have you ever had an indeterminable sadness wash over you and leave a residue you couldn't shake?  i'm pretty sure that i'm not the only person who feels this way.  i just find myself wondering about my future.  mostly, i figure that i'm just lonely.  i've never been in a relationship and question whether i ever will.  i mean, if i've gone this far and never been involved, will i ever?  its the early years when people meet and learn how to get along isn't it?  i've never felt like i fit in and it seems now that i never will.  where is it all going?  maybe i'll leave a life of pseudo happiness and then die.  i say pseudo b/c whenever i'm left will my thoughts i feel like theres nothing here for me.  whenever i'm with company i'm the happy little center of the universe (to paraphrase ed norton).  its not that i am happy, but you flash a smile at the world and the world embraces you.  so in this way i'm pseudo happy.  i'm on one of my stints where i quit on females.  it just seems easier that way.  when you put yourself out there you just find sadness, rejection, and disappointment.  too much roller coaster.  what if, what if, what if...

      hmm...i am the captain of ambivalence and i need directions.  another day, another dollar.  work was boring, luckily it was interrupted by a brief stint of mind numbing in cs336.  speaking of which, perhaps i should prepare for that quiz tomorrow...  Grace:  this isn't a secret diary per se, but a place for me to lay down some thoughts (read the headline :p).  they may seem personal, but aren't everybody's thoughts personal?  directions anyone?

      so, all went pretty well today.  i think i kicked my cs336 midterm's ass.  that class is going surprisingly well, maybe i'm a genious though...afterwards i had the opportunity to meet up with and have some dinner with jennifer (friend from accounting).  She's a really attractive girl, and i want to be able to connect with her, but so far it hasn't been there.  i figure we're still "feeling each other out."  Oh well, can't be sad about having dinner with a smart and attractive lady!

      i think the title says it all.  i need a life, or something.  maybe i just need some hobbies--read a book, fix something, build something--i dunno, maybe i don't have a niche.  i have a test tomorrow and i'm debating studying for it some more.  i'm also meeting with jennifer tomorrow (tentatively).   not quite sure what to expect out of that, but i guess i'll see.  other than that just emptiness on my mind.  where to go what to do, these are the questions that i constantly put myself through.  perhaps someday i won't--yeah i threw some optimism in for kicks.  blah blah blah.

      things i want to learn how to do: 1) Dance - classical and swing are the 2 foremost styles i'd learn, but anything else is game too. 2) Play the piano - seems like something fun to do, but first i need to learn to pat my head and rub my tummy 3) Cook - i'm thinking of taking some classes after i graduate so i can cook bad-ass meals. 4) Mixology - if i'm going to be a killa cook, i need to know how to mix a good drink, or be a proficient alcoholic....  once these tasks are completed, i can make a tantalizing meal for a woman, give her a nice drink, serenade her on the piano and then dance the night away...or just know how to do them to further myself, either way.  i'd feel all kinds of metropolitan if i could do all these things.

      "Here's to today. Because we can't see the future and all we can do is live now...And I will wake up tomorrow. Because I want to live." --grace  where does she get these thoughts?  learning people is so interesting...but to add to what she said, sometimes thats all you can do is wake up and want to live.  life holds an infinite mystery about tomorrow...here's to today and tomorrow, cheers.

      so i decided to explore myself (not like that, don't be sick).  I'm trying out my green thumb in the back yard (again, don't be sick).  I bought an Allamanda and a Texas sage and planted them in our little garden area of our back yard.  Its kinda neat growing things, but people look at me funny whenever you talk about it.  Also, i've been running periodically the last couple of weeks, it feels good to be active again.  I bought a pair of running shoes and basketball shoes so now i have no excuse.  I managed to juke the rubber right off my first pair of running shoes (which i only had a week), so i made the plunge and finally bought another pair.  I had to stop 3 times when running around the lake tonight, but i don't think its bad considering i don't remember the last time i ran--any distance--at all--period.  Also i'm just about done reading Siddhartha, actually re-reading, but i like the book and decided to read it again...what to read next...OH, i also made an A in cs336.  this is turning into the summer of Matt after all, i feel like i'm growing as a person.  good times.

      still not much happening around here.  i finished reading Siddhartha and am debating whether i should read a book for my CS349 class, or another book.  speaking of cs, for my 2 classes i need 6 books combined...i feel like a freshman again having to buy all these crappy books, not to mention the cost--so much for updating my wardrobe.  Instead i get to update my bookshelf.  that reminds me, scott (my brother for those of you not in the know) started putting down the pergo today.  He'd done most of the hard stuff by the time i came back home, but i still put in a few pieces.  The house is going to look badass by the time we replace the crappy carpet and linoleam (that doesn't look right) with pergo and tile.  Hooray for a successful brother!  And since i have an abundance of free time i've been running and playing some pick-up basketball fairly frequently.  I just wish my knees and feet wouldn't get sore afterwards.  But it feels good excercising again.  Now i just need to start playing raquetball again.  i probably should lift some weights, but i'll probably stick to pushups and curls...oh my legs are going to be sore tomorrow.

      so, i'm sitting here at work, and i says to myself, "i'm bored...what am i going to do?"&nbsp; That's basically how my day has gone thus far, pretty slow.&nbsp; the only thing that i've done is get a user's microphone working again, and that was just by plugging it back in....so now i'm killing time while i update another computer.&nbsp; only 2.5 hrs more to go...  However, it is kinda neat to be in charge while my boss is out.&nbsp; Hooray for the positive spin.
