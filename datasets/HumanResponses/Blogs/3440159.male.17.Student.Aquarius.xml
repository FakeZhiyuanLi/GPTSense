      So... we're screwed. It's official. The Ice caps are going to melt and we're all going to die. Or get evacuated down south. I just watched "The Day After Tomorrow" the day after yesterday (or today). Justin Lebens is crackin up right now. Askin me "What else I got?" and tellin me to "Get my face out." It's the new thing: "Get your face out." Use it in place of "Shut up" or "I don't believe you."  Anyway, I liked the movie. Nobody else did except for Angela. She found it both cute and funny and cool. I told her that she needs to learn more adjectives other than "cute". There's a part where all of New York is frozen and Angela exclaimed "Oh that's so cute!"... No, not cute.  So, we're all hanging out at my house right now. Justin G. wants me to type something about him. So there it was. Kevin is special. Not special ed, not special gay, but special awesome.  Hey, you guys are in for a treat! I'm going to make two entries tonight. I have to go pick up three larges for six bucks each right now from Little Ceaser's! That's so great!  Bye for now... until we meet again. (in an hour or so)...  Cy  "If yesterday was today, it would be tomorrow." - Justin Wayne Lebens

      Hey again. What did you come here for? Is it just to read what's going on to make me happy? Or do you really have an interest in what's going on in my life? If it's the first one, stop being a people pleaser. If it's the second one, stop being a freak, you stalker.  Just kidding... keep reading....  So, I'm watching American Idol right now and I've decided. The winner is probably going to be either Fantasia or Diana. Just a guess though. They're all gonna get recording contracts anyway. They say that you get braggin rights though... Come on... "Hey I'm the AMERICAN IDOL!" And?...  Anyway, Ryan "Mr. Vain" Seacrest is reading the comments to them. There's 10 minutes left in the show and we're about to find out who wins... The tension is building. I will reveal the winner in this blog. So don't read somewhere down there if you don't want to know.  American Idol? Well, I don't think idolatry is good, so I think I'm going to call it... OH MY GOSH FANTASIA WON!!!!!....THAT'S AWESOME!!! WOOO!!! Diana's really good though too... Ok. Where was I? Oh yeah I'm going to call it "American Cool Person". That's a good title.  Ok. I do have a life. I gotta be at the Junior High campus tomorrow to do worship. It's gonna be a lot of fun. 6:30AM... early mornin for me. Yeah, so being a senior next year has got me worried. Well, worried, hopeful, excited, etc... A whole bunch of feelings and what not. Whoa, Fantasia is totally killing it right now with this song (in the good way)... That is an awesome first single!  So yeah, I'm just worried about the leadership next year. I know God's been calling me to lead. I'm just hoping he's been calling some others too... specifically more guys... I dunno. Anyway, I gotta go do some homework. See yall tomorrow. Whoa... Fantasia! Yayah!  "You only fall when you take your eyes off the goal."

      Welcome to episode two of a new exciting series called... The Cy-Files!  Well, today was Tuesday. Yep. What happened today? Woke up this morning. Took my Futurama Season 1 back to blockbuster. Went to Jack-In-The-Box to get some breakfast, then went to school...  Wow I was hyper today! I was just really peppy, loud, and obnoxious! Anyway... Yeah it was fun being excited for a change.  I went to get some warm, juicy, delicious, savory, sumptuous nuggets... (with Ketchup) with Kevin and Justin at Wendy's. Good stuff. 99 cents? That's a steal!  Rehearsed a song with the band that we're doing this Friday for chapel called "History Maker"... It sounds pretty good!  Then tonight, there was the academic awards ceremony for the school... What is this for anyway? Is it just for recognition? That's cool. I guess.  Anyway, I'm not going to do this everyday... Just had nothing profound or interesting to say... well except this: Mr. Cronk and I formulated this profoundering quote this morning. It goes something like this:  "The greatest treasures in life are often hidden underneath a pile of poo - it's true."   - Cy and Cronk  Well, that's all for now! Stay tuned for more eppies! Peace out and word up to your g-ma! Yay-ah!

      Hey gang,  Here I am. This is me... well, it's a portion of me... on the web. That's kinda weird. I'm communicating my thoughts through my hands to a keyboard to the computer to the world wide web for your eyes to read. Strange. Anyway, this is my second blog. I was having problems with the first one, so this is a good change. You all know what blogs are for, so there's no purpose in explaining that I'm using this to share my thoughts and experiences; pretty much, just to journal my weekly doings.  So yeah, this is the first post. Right now, I'm at home... sick. And uh... catching up on homework. I can't spend much time on this right now. Hey check out "Anotation" by Ostinato... it just came on the iTunes radio, and it sounds kinda cool. See... that was all in real time right there. I got cut off in my train of thought to tell you to check out a song. Hmmm...

      Well, it's actually been out for three days now, I'm just kinda behind. So anyway, yeah! No more school! Well, at least for a couple months. But it's long overdue.   I'm kinda bummed out, because I didn't do that well this past semester. I'm hoping it wont bring my cumulative avg. down... I just really need to do well on my SAT now to save myself.  So anyway, this past weekend has been awesome! I went back to Cal Lutheran for the 2004 HOBY (Hugh O'Brian Youth) Leadership Seminar as a Junior Staffer. It was incredible! I think I had more fun than I did last year as an 'ambassador', as they're called. So it's fun to be involved and volunteer. Yeah!  Tonight's kinda sad, because I'm going to my friends' graduation. I have a lot of senior friends this year who are leaving the beautiful Antelope Valley, so I'm sad. But it's cool, cause we'll still see each other.   Well, I know I haven't updated this in a long time... but I can't stay long, gotta go to the mall to get some clothes. I'm going to the east coast with my Senior (cause i'm out of school) Class... It's gonna be a blast!  Hey, I'm out! Take it easy!

      Yes, many people fear me... No, probably not. Why would anyone need to fear me? Well, the fact that I'm a psychopathic serial killer could possibly strike fear in the hearts of some... but for the most part, people are cool with me going on my killing rampages.  ^That's all a joke, if you don't know me... (or is it? muawhahaha...)  Here's a list of official phobias that kinda sound like my name:   Cyberphobia  - Fear of computers or working on a computer.  Cyclophobia  - Fear of bicycles.  Cymophobia or Kymophobia  - Fear of waves or wave like motions.  Cynophobia  - Fear of dogs or rabies.  Cypridophobia or Cypriphobia or Cyprianophobia or Cyprinophobia  - Fear of prostitutes or venereal disease.  Psychophobia  - Fear of mind.  Psychrophobia  - Fear of cold.   Come on. Fear of  prostitutes ? This is just more proof that people like to make up things to justify themselves. Do people really have a sincere feel of dread at the sight or mention of a prostitute? Don't get me wrong, I think selling your body for sex is wrong, but fear of prostitutes? Weird. Each man to his own I guess.  Hey, my big bro Abe linked my blog to his blog, so I'm going to return the favor. Go check out my brother's web log or BLOG at  urlLink http://www.onarresdesign.com/blog/ . He's a cool college kid, so his life should be somewhat more interesting than mine. Here's a pic of him...  urlLink      Well the reason I mention fear is because in 20 minutes, I'm going to head over to foursquare church over on challenger to play in the school's spring concert. Now... I'm not in band, though I play alto sax. I told Mr. Lee, the conductor, that I would play in the concerts if he would let me go on the band trips to Biola and Anaheim... So now it's time for me to fulfill my end of the bargain.  The problem is that I have not practiced with the band. Even more of a problem is that I haven't practiced the music at all. As I type this, I still have no idea what it is we're playing tonight. I guess I'll just have to wing it.  And that's what I'm fearful of as of now...   Cyisadummyaphobia : Fear of not being prepared for a band concert... or just fear of Cy not being prepared for something... Use it. Just like "Get your face out of here"...  Anyway, Mr. Lee just called me. I've got to go! See ya later and um... GET YOUR FACE OUTTA HERE!

      I just wanted to say that I love my mom... she's the greatest. It was her birthday today... (shhh... don't tell anyone... she's for tee ate. (that's code for 48) shh...) But yeah, I love her to death and stuff... We went to Red Lobster today and got fat. Good stuff.  Anyway, a toast for all mothers who rock.  Cheers. Cy

      Hey gang... now for something a little more light-hearted...  I'M HOOKED ON MUSICALS! I had a lot of fun doing My Fair Lady in drama last year, but it didn't really spark an interest in me. So this past June, we went to Broadway in New York and watched Phantom of the Opera.  I took some pictures inside Phantom of the Opera and Hairspray. Yeah, I know you're not supposed to, but I loved it a lot... just had to.   PHANTOM OF THE OPERA   urlLink     Wow! This was an incredible musical! It was my first and I loved it very much. The story is so rich and emotion driven. Good stuff. Great acting, great singing. Loved it.   urlLink      HAIRSPRAY: THE MUSICAL   urlLink     I saw this in San Diego as I mentioned a couple days ago with my mom. It was a lot of fun to watch. There was just a bunch of energy. Also, Bruce Vilanch was so funny. He plays Tracy's mom in the musical. There were a lot of ad libbed parts that he did... From our political system to Martha Stewart... it was so funny. Anyway, had a blast. SEGREGATION SUCKS!   urlLink     urlLink      THE PRODUCERS   urlLink     This is going to be great. I've kinda wanted to see this since it first came out, I think two-three years ago. Anyway, I'm going to be seing this in Orange County on August 22... So yeah, I heard it's really funny and somewhat offensive. Nice. Mel Brooks is the man.   urlLink     Musical Fever: Inhale it, get infected, cough it up, give it to the one you love.

      I'm serious. I want this freakin war to end, now! I hate that we're over there killing people and that we're sending our own citizens over there to a hostile place where our own are dying everyday.  I read today that they found the head of Paul Johnson, an American who worked on Apache hellicopters. He was captured and soon after, beheaded. I did some research online and stumbled across a link to a site that had pictures and a video of the beheading. I really didn't want to watch it, but the curious side of me did, so I checked out the pictures, and my eyes welled up with tears. War is so ugly... I hate this. I definitely knew I didn't want to watch the video... but I did. It made me sick. Sick to my stomach (It's very, very graphic) and sick just about fighting and war and all this crap. I don't know how I feel about them putting the video on the internet, but first amendment rights and all... Ugh. It's disgusting.   If you really want to see the pictures and the video, you'll be able to find it... I'm definitely not giving out the link here. Have a strong stomach too... I can take pretty gruesome/gross stuff... but this was hard for me.   Man, I hope this ends soon. Peace and love to all our troops and civilians out there. We're praying for you and want you all to return safely. God, watch over them...   " I HAVE SEEN WAR  I HAVE SEEN WAR ON LAND AND SEA. I HAVE SEEN BLOOD RUNNING FROM THE WOUNDED... I HAVE SEEN THE DEAD IN THE MUD. I HAVE SEEN CITIES DESTROYED... I HAVE SEEN CHILDREN STARVING. I HAVE SEEN THE AGONY OF MOTHERS AND WIVES.  I HATE WAR"   -Franklin Delano Roosevelt     Dang, this sucks. Cy

      Yeah, it's me again. There's nothing going on today, so I'm making another post. This isn't news to some people, but it is to most... I cut my hair! Yep, I sold out and fell victim to the man. (My Mom). She hates long hair. I had to appease her. I got it cut real short, and put some highlights in. Anyway, here is what my hair looked like, and what it looks like now.    Before    After   Nice eh? And because I'm even more conceited, here are more views of my hair:    Front View    Side View    Top View   There... if you didn't have enought pictures of my hair, there it was. Man, I'm really bored... 8:00 couldn't come any slower.  Peace, Cy

      Weird... third post of the day. Anyway, I discovered this new thing called audioblogging! It's been around for awhile and Blogger is offering it for free for its users. All you do is call a number, imput your unique information, then record a message, and they'll post it to your blog. It's pretty sweet. They say it's useful when you're away from a computer, on the road, or just want to hear your voice. It's stored on their site in mp3 format, then when you click on a link, like the one below, it'll download and play the message. It's pretty neat. Anyway, it's cool... If you're on blogger, try it out.    Audioblogger.com    urlLink

      Yo! Wassup? Well, went to Best Buy today and my mom bought me a CD! She's the coolest! I'm just kidding. But seriously, she is. Anyway, I bought --well, my mom bought Chronic Future's new EP out called "Lines In My Face". And it rocks! It's different and it's really good stuff.   You can click on the picture below to launch the band's player. There you can watch their new music video for "Time and Time Again" and listen to some other songs on their CD. I like it a lot.    urlLink     urlLink  Chronic Future's Official Site    Check it out, you'll see their style is totally different, which is pretty awesome. Chronic Future - Lines In My Face... good listens...  Still enjoying my summer. There's a worship team meeting tonight at 8:00... that's all I'm doing tonight. I might have a movie night afterwards for anyone who wants to come. Hey, you're invited too!    "there's some utterly damaged particles to deal with and if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift when stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to lift I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed you dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist and there's no way to get back experiences you missed so start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss.  time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are but you can't keep running away from what your trying to find."

      Hey, I'm making a lot of posts to make up for how long I've been gone. Well, I'm addicted to these shows... I know, I know, I'm a nerd. But I really like watching them change people's rooms into either a disaster or something pretty cool. A lot of them really turn out bad, though... here's an example:          Oh Dangit! It's all white!... I didn't see this episode, so I don't know if they liked it, but that thing is hideous! Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys... I'm off to youth group...  L8r!

       	 		 		  I just wanted to share that I'm really excited about this movie coming out. I loved the first one, so I'm looking forward to this one too. December 10! Wooo!   Actually, I'm just testing out this new picture posting site that I joined so that I could post photos to my blog from my mac. I guess it works, don't know if I like it that much though.  Take care of yourself.  Cy 		 		 		 			 urlLink

      Hey gang,  Man it's been a long time since i've updated this thing. Almost more than a month. I actually tried to post something on the 4th of July, but something went wrong or something.   Anyway, how are you? Thanks for dropping by. Not many people read this anyway, so think of yourself as pretty darn special.  So I went to San Diego this past weekend with the folks, it was pretty awesome. I slept all the way there and all the way back, so no long drive for me. But anyway, We were down there because it was my uncle's 50th birthday. His family threw him a huge bash, about a hundred or so people were there. There was a caterer and everything, some awesome food, some awesome music, awesome stuff. It's crazy though, because most of my cousins are older than me, so a lot of them were drinking. A lot. It was actually quite funny to watch.  That got me thinking. 50 years old... that's only 33 years away for me. I'm basically a third of the way there. 50! That's crazy...  On Sunday we went downtown where we stayed at a pretty nice hotel right in the heart of downtown. Sunday night, my mom and I saw Hairspray the musical. We weren't really planning on it. It was just an idea. We didn't have tickets or anything, we actually went 20 minutes before the show started to see if they had leftover tickets. $32 for cheap seats up in the balcony. We ran into a lady who was with her church group and two people in her group couldn't make it, so she sold the tickets to us. $100 for two tickets, Row K of the Orchestra section. These were $68 seats, so we got a great deal! My mom had a lot of fun. It was the first time she saw a musical. I had seen Phantom of the Opera this past June on Broadway in N.Y., and since then, I've been hooked on musicals. I'm going to see The Producers in Orange County on August 22.  Well, that's all the time I have for right now... Gotta go do stuff...  Love, Peace, and Chicken Grease, Cy

      Wow, it's been a long time since I've posted. Well anyway, Happy fourth to you all! Hope it's memorable.  Anyway, gee... so much has happened since my last entry. Let's see. Here's a list of things I did (I might have missed some stuff)...  1. Went to Washington, D.C., Amish Country (Lancaster County, PA), New Jersey, and New York with my senior class ('05!). 2. Father's Day at Black Angus. 3. Super Senior Summer Smash at Alex Burt's house. 4. Cross Country practices. 5. ....  Wow, pretty uneventful. June was a blah month I guess. Well I'm outty for now, gonna go barbecue with the folks. Have fun and be safe with those fireworks!  Cy
