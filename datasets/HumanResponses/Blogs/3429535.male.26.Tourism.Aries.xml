      	If you like watching aging hippies bitch and moan about how the kids today suck watch the latest episode of the PBS series Frontline called “The Way the Music Died.” Frontline is usually one of the best news shows on television and has done insightful episodes recently on the war in Iraq and the war on terror, but this episode was lamer than a person wearing a tied-dyed t-shirt driving a SUV. The show has two stories weaved together. One is a comparison of the experiences between a new singer/songwriter named Sarah Hudson and a new rock grouped called Velvet Revolver formed by ex-members of Guns n Roses and Stone Temple Pilots. The other story is a study of the problems inside the music industry that are causing the problems such as internet piracy, radio consolidation, and limited shelf space in stores like Wal-Mart. The show also includes commentary by people like David Crosby, Nic Harcourt, and different writers, producers, and mangers in the business. The one group not interviewed in the show is the fans or rather the consumers of the music. The reason for not interviewing the people who actually buy music is that the complaint of people like David Crosby is not that people don’t buy music it is that people don’t buy the music he thinks they should. The entire show is based of a fallacy, which is if people listened to better music, or what some consider better music the music industry would make more money. If good music equaled good sales Mike Watt would be a millionaire and if bad music equaled bad sales Avril Lavigne would playing on street corners. The music industry like every other industry in America relies on cheap low quality disposable product for the bulk of it sales. In rare instances is the most popular music the best music around such as in the late 60’s with The Beatles, but for the most part the best bands are never the most popular or popular at all. The Ramones never had any real popular success, but their records are still in print while whatever was top of the charts for most of their career has been swept into the dustbin of pop music to never be heard again. Good music has never translated into good sales because like any product the market has to be there.  	Sarah Hudson, a young singer/songwriter, is used to illustrate the difficulties of a new artist trying to break into the music industry, but what she really represents is the rot inside the music industry caused by nepotism. Hudson is the daughter of Mark Hudson who is a songwriter and record producer. He had some success in the 1960’s with a folk band and a variety show. It is very clear after hearing her songs that without her family connections the record would never of been made. The songs are standard teenage angst and the music sounds like the Saved by the Bell Theme song. The fact that a record company would spend thousands of dollars promoting such mediocre music into a market that is already super-saturated with teen-girl angst pop is the real problem. The record company would much rather try to recycle previous success than discover something new. I call this the dub syndrome because record companies try to repeat a success by finding something that is similar, but not quite as good. For example a great band like Green Day begets a decent band like Blink-182 who beget a totally crap band like New Found Glory. Like a dub taped each succeeding generation is of lesser quality. In the case of Sarah Hudson she is trying to ride the anti-Britney wave of Avril Lavigne and Michelle Branch. Hudson’s manager actually describes her an alternative to Britney.  	Britney Spears is used in the show to epitomize everything wrong with today's music even though her actual music is never discussed. No one bothers to mention that Max Martin is a great producer who has made with Spears some great pop songs. Her success is explained with the idea that since Mtv started music has become more about the visual than the actually music. Because modern pop music came about around the same time as television pop music has always been visually driven and Mtv is not at fault, but merely a product of this connection. The visual image has always been just as important music in the world of pop; otherwise, Big Mama Thorton would have sold a million copies of Hound Dog and Elvis would still be driving a truck. Explaining Britney success as image over music is condescending to the millions of people who buy her records and see her on tour. This condescending attitude that Britney fans are stupid leads to the moronic idea that if record companies put the money they use to promote Britney into music of "high quality" that music would sell like Britney's does. This is of course stupid because promotion merely opens the door if fans chose not to go through all the promotion in the world is not going to make a difference. Using Britney as a scapegoat just shows how lame and out of touch these people are. On the web page www.pbs.org is an interview with David Crosby and one of the question he is asked is “Be specific. I mean, Jesus, one moment, you're talking about Woodstock and the incredible beauty of what you guys had everybody on that stage to Britney Spears shaking her tits. How did we get there?” First given the choice between the beauty of Woodstock and Britney Spears shaking her tits I’ll take Britney besides is anything more rock and roll than things shaking. More to the point in both the question and Crosby’s answer is a hippie arrogance that anyone born after 1970 has had to live with when it comes to music. Because of hippies and baby boomers in general need to always be cool and hip they see their youth as the pinnacle of coolness with Woodstock being the zenith, so everything after is judged in relation to their time. Baby Boomers are not alone in thinking their the coolest. Every generation thinks the generation after them music sucks and the older generation always says the same thing, “This isn’t real music. When I was a kid music was…” Crosby disdain for today’s music is no different than the disdain older musicians felt about his music thirty years ago. Frank Sinatra along with many others hated rock and roll and thought it was garbage when it first stated. Crosby disdain for today’s music is no different. 	In the contrast to the Sarah Hudson story is the story of Velvet Revolver a new group featuring the band from Guns n Roses and Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots on vocals. Similarly to Britney, Velvet Revolver is used to illustrate what is wrong with today’s music. The band is derided as being nothing more than the record company’s attempt to cash in on the previous success of the band member. Again like Britney the Band is discussed without its music every being talked about. No one mentions that putting a group of talented musicians together may make for some interesting music. Saying that Velvet Revolver may not be a very good band because the success of the band members’ previous bands is stupid. Even worse arguing that this band is cashing in on is old success while using a David Crosby concert to open the show is outright hypocrisy. Most 60’s musician still performing today are cashing in on their success from 30 years ago. When people go see Crosby do they want hear his new stuff? no they want the hits from when they were young. Even someone like Paul McCartney would be booed if at a concert he said he was only going to play new songs. At least Velvet Revolver is trying to make new music and not just singing 30-year-old hits with a group of studio musicians. In comparison to Sarah Hudson, Velvet Revolver is much better investment for a record company because it is not trying to enter a marketplace already filled. Unlike teen pop, there is a vacuum for a good hard rock/metal band to fill. As usual the problems the people on the show have with Velvet Revolver has nothing to do with their music, but all this stuff surrounding the music.  	For all the people on the show complaining about the corporatizaion of rock is anything more corporate than linking the state of music to the state of the music business. Great music is always being made and the fact that major corporations are having financial problems has no impact on that what so ever. The reasons  given in the show for the music business problems sound more like excuses than actual problems. Many argued the consolidation of radio ownership is stopping great music from getting out because of restricted play list. Long before Clear Channel owned a thousand stations radio stations stopped play new music. In the 80’s I don’t remember hearing Husker Du or a lot of other great bands on the radio before radio was deregulated in the 90‘s. By all the accounts I have read not since the early 70’s have radio station taken any chances with new music. Almost anyone who listen to independent music turned off their radio along time except for maybe the local college station. The limited amount of space given to music in huge chain stores like Wal-Mart is another reason given for the lack of good new music, but as someone who grew up in suburban New Jersey the music I wanted was rarely available at the local Sam Goody so I either got it through mail order or  from a friend. It is even easier now with the internet to find almost anything.  	Music piracy maybe the one valid reason for the lack of new music. Downloading music for free has the greatest impact on independent musicians because what little money they make from their music goes right back into their music. I don’t work for free and I don’t expect anyone else to. The excuse that most albums only have few good song and the rest of the album sucks is bologna because the one song is probably a hit song and companies still make cd singles for a much lower price than a whole cd. Downloading music is stealing just as bootlegging is and anyone who really cares about music should not do it. 	What really bothered me the most about the show was that music fans were never asked what was wrong or if anything was wrong with music today. Fans were left out while a number of djs, managers, writers who get their music and tickets for free were asked their opinions. Also the state of independent music was ignored completely. Frequently in the show it is mentioned that 30,000 albums are released every year and only a handful become hits. Well a lot of that 30,000 is released by independent labels who have know they have no chance of having a hit or evening making much money, but do it because they love music. Great music and popular music may at time cross paths but usually they don’t. David Crosby bemoaning what is popular today illustrates what a potato head he is because there is a lot of great music that he and many others  never hear because they don’t go out and look for it.  Great music is made every day without any help from music industry and to blame the music business for running itself like a business is dumb. The only agenda record companies have is to make money and they would sell anything if they thought they could make money. Blaming record companies for what you think is the horrible state of music is like blaming McDonalds for making you fat. No one puts the burger in your mouth and no one else is to blame for your being to lazy go out and find music you like.

      I saw this on ebay "ANGRY SAMOANS The Unboxed Set CD punk rock emo." There are many adjectives to describe The Angry Samonas but emo is not one of them, but I maybe wrong. So I am proposing a Contest!!!!- Name the most emo Angry Samoan song and why and you will win a book if your answer is the best. My choice is My Old Man's Fatso because "My old Man's a Fatso/He's got a bathtub for a mouth/My old Man's a Fatso/ but you know he owns this house" says more about growing up than Holden Caulfield ever did.

      I have just received a new uniform from the hotel where I work. It is a black vest, black pants, white shirt, and a green tie. The manger believes that the new uniform will help us to present a more professional image.  My responsibilities as a front desk clerk do not require any special clothing. I could perform my job functions just as well in Bermuda shorts and tank top as I can do them in my new uniform. So, why does my manger take on the expenses of buying and maintaining uniforms? He does it because I am not a person at work, but a concept. My uniform turns me into a concept for the guest of what he or she believes a front desk clerk at a hotel should be. Simply by putting on the uniform guest will listen to my driving directions and restaurant recommendations, although; I have never eaten at most of the restaurants I recommend and I have no sense of directions because I don't own a car. The faith guest have in what I say does not come from me as person, but from me in a uniform as a concept.

      For the past 3 days  The VH-1/Blender Magazine 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever  has been on TV when I get home from work. I only have basic cable so my chooses are rather slim and at 3 in the afternoon. Television at 3 is a sea of Oprah and Oprah wannabes; although Ellen comes on at 3, but this week is all reruns. Also being a music fan I was interested in what they meant by “awesomely bad.” I quickly realized that show has nothing to do with music and is just a forum for the uber-hip to make fun of songs they used to like. A review of the list illustrates the problem of the music industry over the last 20 years: quick money over good music. The list is full of mostly gimmick songs such as songs by celebrities like Don Johnson or with a pop culture hooks like Barbie world. The disturbing thing about the show is that the same people from Spin and Rolling Stone magazine who are now making funny of these songs promoted them with glee when they were popular. The need of music industry to artificial remain hip at all times requires it to eat its young by promoting what will sell now over what will be good in the future. Many people on the list such as Limp Bizkit, Ricky Martin, and Puffy Daddy have appeared on the cover of every music industry magazine and are given major play on both Mtv and the radio. It is the hypocrisy of promoting garbage and then laughing at those who buy it that has ruined music. Blender magazine, which falls into that category of magazines like Maxim and Stuff of being basically porn for guys to wimpy to buy real porn, is partners in the list with VH-1. Blender is the zenith of image over substance and quick sales of garbage in music because the magazine is nothing more than a glossy advertisement for the flavor of the month. The cover stories have dealt with such musical topics as the 50 sexist artist of all time and sexy, young, and talented with cover photos to match. This month their pulse is really on today’s music with Courtney Love on the cover. Is there a grunge revival no one told about?  To be fair many of the songs on the list I agree sucked, but I never told anyone to buy the records or tried to pretend the “thong song” was anything but stupid.

      People named Lenny are usually pretty cool Lenny Bruce, Lenny Dykstra, Lenny from the Simpson, but there is one major exception: Lenny Kravitz. I have always thought Lenny Kravitz was a dork and that his music is a combination of Hallmark card lyrics" we gotta to let love rule" with cheese ball bloated 70's rock "Are you gonna go my way?" By themselves those two things would not make Kravitz a dork, it is the sheer pretentiousness that oozes out of him in every song and video that puts the D on his forehead. I saw his new video on VH1 and the first minute is hysterical. It is pure Kravitz. It shows him waking in room that obviously was party central the night before filled with empty bottles and waif models. There are so many models that I lost count at one point. Plus all the models have this hangdog expression that makes them look like copies of each other. Kravitz walks by them not noticing as their stare up at him like a dog wanting attention. Kravitz emphasis the coolness of the party by lifting one of the half empty bottles and staring at it and thinking about all the wasted years partying I guess. After putting the bottle down, he runs apparently all the way from his hotel to the stage. Amazingly he is not winded when he sings the lame ass song about love or something. The name of the song is “where are we running?” and I wonder if during his concerts he plays that along with "What Did I Do With My Life?" and "Are you gonna go my way?" as question and answer segment with the audience. It has now been ten years so Kurt Cobain's death is it not time for the tortured rock star image to die as well. No one would blame Lenny if he took his "gift" and kept it to himself. He might not feel so tortured if he was not so rich and successful. Hey it works for me. To clarify Lenny Kravitz sucks, if you like him your taste in music sucks and should go buy the first 3 Ramones records.

      We live in a time of image over substance and mediocrity is expected, so seeing Mort Sahl on Friday night was like walking into a time warp. A time warp where comedians were funny and the show wasn't just a pretext to hawk t-shirts. Sahl performed at McCabe's Guitar shop that has hosted everyone from B.B. King to Henry Rollins (he has a spoken word disc out recorded there). The show began with folk guitarist Shawn Amos. I was rather angry when I heard there was going to be an opening band. Having spent too many years listening to crappy opening bands waiting for the headliner, but Amos was great. His songs were good original folk tunes with a sense of humor and more heart than anything on the radio. It was also great that it only lasted about 25 minutes the perfect time for folk music or any kind of music when you have to go to work the next morning. Mort Sahl came on stage with his trademark sweater and newspaper under his arm with a white board set up behind to explain the world. His routine is combination of political satire mixed with cultural observation and history lessons. On the board was written an L on the left an R on the right and SD in the middle. The L and R on self-explanatory and the SD stood for social Democrat. Sahl argued there is not true left wing in America just a bunch of social democrats that feel guilty. He put pictures of different famous people including President Bush, Fidel Castro, and Sean Penn under what he felt was the appropriate column. Some of the more interesting choices were Michael Moore as a left wing fascist and Bruce Willis as right wing fascist. He followed his routine with a question and answer set open to the audience. He was asked who his favorite young comedian was and he said Jonathan Winters. When asked a question about who he was going to vote for he said Ralph Nader if he can get on the ballot. He explained that the state of American politics is so dismal today because all we do is compromise what we believe in. He pointed out that those who don't want Nader to run are those who agree with him the most. I kept looking for Mr. Peabody and his time machine because someone was doing something old fashion: Telling the truth.   urlLink Mort Sahl   urlLink Shawn Amos   urlLink McCabe's Guitar Shop

       I used to rock and roll all night and party everyday. Then it was every other day. Now I’m lucky to find a have an hour a week in which to get funky.- Homer Simpson   It was like 1980 all over again last night in Los Angeles. The Angry Samoans at one club and The Weirdos at another and me at neither. Why is it when your young you can’t wait to go to 21+ shows, and when you are over 21 you don’t have the time or the energy to go? The last show I attended was the Black Flag reunion shows that despite the naysayers was awesome. Seeing Greg Ginn on guitar, Robo on Drums, and Dez Cadena singing was the closest I would ever get to seeing one of my all time favorite bands. Even if the bass was prerecorded, I wasn’t there for the music as much as I was for the sense of excitement I felt when I was young hearing songs like “Clocked In” and “Six Pack” for the first time. Had I gone out I would have gone to see The Angry Samoans because they have a special place in my heart for once playing at my High School (Santa Monica High) where they were introduced by Richard Meltzer who asked if their were any heroin addict in the crowd. You know you are getting old when you start weighing pleasure vs. aggravation when deciding to go out. For example I would have loved to see The Angry Samoans, but I didn’t want to see the 4 opening bands or pay 5 dollars for a beer. The aggravation outweighed the pleasure so I stayed and watched a Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald concert and the last week’s De La Hoya fight. The biggest reason I didn’t go was because I had to be up at 5am the next morning to go to work. In a perfect world there should be at the most 2 opening band that should play no longer than 30 minute set and the headliners should play at the most 45 minutes. Bands should keep in mind people have to get up and go to work in the morning.

      No man mixed black soul with white country better than Ray Charles. I suggest listening to Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music for the next 24 hrs to pay respect to one of the men that started Rock and Roll. If you don't own this record get your lame ass off my blog.

              Ever since my grandpa bought me some comics as a reward for learning to siphon gas I have been an obsessive comic book reader. Comic books in many ways saved my life. I was told in the second the grade that I had dyslexia. My second grade teacher explained that dyslexia was a learning disability and that I would have to be in a special classroom for the third grade. The school called the special class the resource room; the kids called it the retard room. The only good thing about the resource room was that I sent there with my friend Chuck who also had dyslexia. 	For the next two years, Chuck and I had the same teacher and the same lessons. By the fifth grade I was told I had "tested out" and that when I began middle school next year I would back in regular classes. Chuck stayed in through middle school and into high school. I always wonder what was it that enabled me to leave. It could not of been the teaching or the instruction because they were the same for both of us. The only difference was my fanatical comic book reading.  	The combination of text and visual images in comic books taught me how to read and understand story on a narrative level when I had trouble reading it on a textual one. My dyslexia made it difficult for me to follow a narrative in a text because the words would move or rearrange on the page in front of my eyes, but in comic books I was able to create the connection between the text and visual image to create a narrative. Over time this gave me the ability to follow text in the same way I followed pictures. It was the ability to create a linear chain of narrative elements that made it possible for me to read a novel.  	My own personal experience with comic books illustrates their power as a tool to teach literacy. As teacher have to find new ways to teach they need to open themselves up to all the tools available to them. The image of comic books as poorly written and drawn stories of guys in tights has blinded many to their power in the classroom. The combination of text and visual images can be used to teach a more complete form of literacy than text-only books because students will have to interpret the visual image along with the text. On every level and in almost every subject comic books are being found to be useful tools to help student learn. 	Similar to the term junior college as opposed to community college, comic books by having the term comic in the name causes many to think of them as being childish or not suitable for the classroom. Scott McCloud in Understanding Comics suggests that comic books are a victim of people confusing form with content. Most people judge the form of comic books by judging the content of most comics. Which is juvenile and disposable such as Archie and Jughead. The term comic in comic books seem to limit in many people's mind the potential for comics to tell stories of high quality. Many artists prefer the term graphic novels and sequential art instead of comic book to describe their work. Scott McCloud defines comics as," juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence intended to convey information and or produce an aesthetic response in the view"(McCloud 23). While McCloud's definition is somewhat convoluted it is completely neutral towards style, subject matter, quality or content. It frees comics from the narrow definition many people have that comes from content and not form. Sherry Kerr, an instructional consultant with the Los Angeles Educational Partnership told the Los Angeles Times, " It’s too bad comic books are named comic books. They are a serious approach to expressing ideas and concepts.” 	The form of using images and words in a sequential is thousand of years old. The Mayan used a form of what we would call comics to record their history hundreds of years before Cortex. The father of modern comics is Rudolphe Topffer. He was contemporary of Goethe and was the first in Europe to create works that they text and the images were dependent on each other for meaning. In America comics got their start in newspaper as mostly political editorials such as "The Yellow Kid." Their popularity grew especially among adolescent and teenage boys, who are still today the main audience for comic books, so the form was used to produce content that would appeal to boys.  Everything changed in 1954 with the publication of Seduction of the Innocent by Dr. Frederick Wertham. Wertham blamed comic books for everything from race-hatred to learning disabilities. He also claimed that Batman and Robin promoted homosexuality and that reading comic books would lead to juvenile delinquency. The government took Wertham seriously and held hearings in the Senate. The most popular comics at the time were EC Comics that were mostly of the crime and horror genre. This meant many of these comics were filled with violent imagery such as severed heads and rotting bodies. Out of fear of government regulation the comic book industry created the Comic Code.  The Comic Code set a standard for what could and what could not be in a comic. All depiction of gore and sadistic violence were banned, so were challenges to authority and marriage. EC Comics went out of business because it was unable to adapt to the new restrictions. The genres of horror and crime were abandoned for much safer content such as talking animals, superheroes and romance. The limiting of content left many with the impression that medium of comics could only deal with those limited genres.  The rise of independent and underground comics by artist like Robert Crumb led to the first cracks in Comic Code. Crumb produced comics for adults with adult themes. In the 1980's seminal works like The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and The Watchman by Allen Moore illustrate the potential of the comic book medium to tell stories with depth of character and plot. The best example of the potential of comic books to tell significant stories was Maus by Art Spiegelman. Maus won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992 and tells the story of Spiegelman's father experiences in the concentration camps during the Holocaust. Spiegelman tells the story by having the Jews as mouse and the Nazi's as cats. Maus is as much about the relationship between Spiegelman and his father as it is about the Holocaust. Maus helped to change the minds of many about the potential of comic books, but the prejudice still exists. 	Teachers across the country have seen beyond the prejudice and have begun to introduce comic books into their classroom for a variety of subjects.  An article in the Los Angeles Times reported that at Hale Middle school in the San Fernando Valley students are not only given comics to read, but that the students have to develop their own comics based upon their learning of ancient Egypt. In the creation of the comic books student also learn about drawing and math by learning to keep the characters proportional on the page. Teachers are also using the characters students create to teach science by illustrating how superpower would work in the real world. Comic books offered these teachers a way to engage students in something the students are already interested and allowed the teachers to do it in an interdisciplinary manner. 	Using comics in the classroom is very akin to Paulo Freiro’s ideas that teachers should use tools that students already feel comfortable with. His idea that a primer for students should come from the students applies here because the teachers are connecting to students on their own level.  One could also apply Deborah Brandt’s ideas from Sponsors of Literacy, but instead of the sponsor being a person the sponsor is an object. Comic books have that power to ignite a spark inside of readers that will encourage them to explore literacy and adopt reading and writing to serve their own needs as the students at Hale Middle School have. 	Rocco Versaci in his essay How Comic Books Can Change the Way Our Students See Literature writes how he used comic books to help student overcome their fears that they were not capable of interpreting literature by having them interpret comic books first. Versaci used the prejudice that comic books were simpler forms of literature to teach students the process of interpretation. He found that many of his students had no real opinions about what they read beyond that if it was assigned in class it must be classic and that their interpretation must fit into what others had already said. His goal was to get students to level where they could be critical of a work by using the process they learned by interpreting comics. 	The students desire to interpret literature in a way they believe the university wanted them too illustrates David Bartholomae’s idea from Inventing the University in which he describes the desire of students to read and write in a way they believe is appropriate for the university even if they do not what that way truly is. Bartholomae argues that one way to help students is to "demystify" the process, so those students can see if for the process it is. Versachi does this when he gives comic books to students to interpret because he is able to teach them the process without them being scared to learn it. The account o f F. Niyi Akinnaso’s personal journey towards literacy is akin in many ways to the student in Versaci’s essay because both had a change in consciousness by changing the role of literacy in their lives. The role of literacy in Akinnaso’s world was one of utility in that literacy had practical role in the economic life of the village.  As Akinnaso read more his consciousness expanded and he was able to see that literacy had an application beyond the one he had been taught. Similarly, the students in the literature class had their consciousness expanded about their own capabilities when comic books were used to teach them. Akinnaso’s idea that literacy is attached to consciousness can be seen in the way the students were able to expand their mind using comic books to learn literary interpretation. 	As the popularity of comics in the classroom has increase, so has research into why it is such an effective tool for teaching literacy. One reason is the surprisingly high level of vocabulary and syntax used in comics. Cornell University sociology professor Donald P. Hayes told the Los Angeles Times that comic books scored higher than Mtv and prime time television in analysis of their text content. Hayes found that Mtv and Prime time television were at about a third grade level of literacy and that comic books were at a sixth grade level of literacy. Comic books now are used primarily to help students with learning difficulties or second language learners. This is an excellent use of comics because a study in the Journal of Child Language found that comics introduce readers to twice as many words as most children books and five times as many as the normal conversation between an adult and child.  	The connection between comic books and reading is evident in Finland that has the highest student reading scores and the highest number of children reading comic books. One of the reasons that comics help students so much is the accessible nature of the medium. Many adults who hate to read were once kids who hated to read because of the frustration they felt in not understanding what they were reading. Comic books help to build confidence in one's ability to understand and comprehend literature. Comic books also act as springboard to more reading because reading becomes fun and not a chore. Using comic books to help students who have difficulties reading is a excellent use, but comics have an even greater potential as serious works of literature that can be study the same way students today study The Great Gatsby. 	Comic books as literature is an oxymoron to most people. Fifty years ago so was ethnic literature. Education can never be static. As the students change, so must how and what they are taught. Today, students are entertained from birth and education needs to be in some ways entertaining. During my classroom observations I noticed that the best teachers were also entertainers. Ms. Jag a teacher at Santa Monica High School was able to present material such as The Odyssey in a way that made it enjoyable for the students. I am sure she is teaching it different than she ten years ago. 	 	A very modern reason why comic should be used in the classroom is because there is almost no critical study of comic books. Students would be forced to come up with their own ideas and theories about what a particular work means. They would not be able to just summarize someone else's idea and present them. They would have to enter the work and find the meaning inside the text and inside themselves. Also students would be forced to read because there are no Cliff Notes for comic books as of yet. The lack of critical study would also prevent studies from downloading papers off the Internet. Teachers who have used comics have found that the use of comics disorientates students and breaks down their aversion to many of the terms used in literary study like tone, character, use of irony and others. The accessible nature of comics causes students to put down their defenses towards learning.  	Comic books greatest asset according to most teachers is that they motivate students to read more than anything else does. Sherry Kerr and J.H. Culhane believe that the reason comic books are so effective is because as children: Our attention system has a built-in bias for high contrast, novelty, and emotional overtones. The 	fact that most children gravitate toward the comic form of art and literature at a certain age indicates that their discovery of this medium not only fills their emotional need to mix the symbolic (letters, words, icons) and the pictorial (images, colors, layouts). Students come away from educational comics with a rich narrative meaning and a story that has relevance to their own understanding of the universe they in habit (Kerr and Culhane 2).  Another reason comics are such a great motivator for students to read is their connection to popular culture. The recent Spiderman movie caused increased in students reading comics and teachers using them in the classroom. Jean Diamond a High School teacher in Bethesda, Maryland told the Washington Post " There really is a resurgence in this and it’s a fabulous way to gets to think creatively." 	One reason that students enjoy comics so much is their combination of picture and text to tell the story.  McCloud argues that one reason for this is students’ ability to put themselves inside the story because they are not as abstract as text by itself or as concrete as photographs. In other words a drawing of a circle with 3 dots and smile is every human face, but a photograph is just one particular human face. The use of icons and archetypes in comic books helps students put themselves into the action. The engagement of the reader into the action of the story is not just because she can see herself in the story, but also because the reader makes so much of the story in her head.  	 Comic books’ use of closure to tell much of the story makes them an excellent tool for teaching students that literacy is not just understanding text, but also understanding images. Closure is the ability to observe the parts but perceive the whole. For example, in a photograph from the waist up we assume that the person in the photo has legs even though we do not see them. Scott McCloud in Understanding Comics suggests that comic books more than any other medium use this idea to create the story. In a comic book the space in between the pictures is called the gutter and this is where the magic of comics occurs. Because the images in comic books are static the reader must create the ideas of time, motion, and change that occur from one drawing to the next. Look at this panel (this panel comes from Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud)       and see how the writer leaves it up to reader to decide what happens. Each reader of that panel had something different happen. McCloud argues that comic more than other form put the power in the hands of the reader, "The comic creator asks us to join in a silent dance of the seen and unseen: The visible and the invisible. This dance is unique to comics No other art form gives so much to it audience. While asking so much form them as well" (McCloud 92). Comic books force the reader to read the images and the text and find the meaning of both. 	In this essay I have tried to use the feminine pronoun as much as possible because one of the objection many people have towards comics is that they are for boys and exclude girls on the basis of subject matter. One of my classmates told me she did an informal survey of her class about who read comic books and almost all the boys had read or were reading comic books, but that few girls raised their hands. While it is true that the vast majority of comic books are adolescent male power fantasies in the form of super heroes increasingly women are finding comic books to be an excellent format in which to express themselves.  Unfortunately, the image of the comic book guy from The Simpsons is rather accurate about the majority of comic book readers, but again seeing comic books as a boy thing that excludes girls is a confusion of content over form. There is no reason the form of comic books can not be used to tell stories that girls will have just as much interest in as boys.  	One work that may interest female students is Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. Persepolis tells the story of girl growing up in Iran during the revolution of the 1979. The book offers not only an excellent story, but also a cross-cultural and historical one. Boys like comic books because they can see themselves in them. For girls to be interested in comic books they need to be given material that speaks to them. Persepolis is just one of many new comic books that woman are creating to tell their own stories in the medium of comic books. With student literacy on a steady decline and students entering universities in need of remedial comprehension and composition classes teachers need to use all available tools to help students gain a level literacy that will help them in the world. The potentials of comic books make it an untapped resource for both teachers and students. Comic books should not only be added to English curriculums: they should be required. The combination of text and images found in comic books make it the perfect tool for teaching literacy on multiple levels. Also the capability of comic books to help students enjoy and understand literature and literacy make it necessary to find ways to overcome the prejudice many have towards comic books. I am implicit in this prejudice. Every time I walk out of comic book store I act like I just walked out of an adult book store, but I keep going back because I know it was comic books that taught me how to read and more importantly they taught me how to dream.

      Even in Blackouts is my new favorite band. Such luminaries as The Minutemen, Teengenerate, and most recently The Lisa Marr Experiment have held the position of favorite band in the past. My favorite bands although they all may fall under the heading of punk their sounds are usually radically different. Punk to me is not about a particular sound, but about a particular type of energy in the music. Even in Blackouts brings the energy of punk uses it to create an acoustic wall of sound that is as original as anything I have ever heard. To be honest I only bought the record because John “Jughead” Pierson from Screeching Weasel was playing on it. I have always been a sucker for when a guy from a band I like goes and starts another band although usually the new bands sucks. For some reason I thought Pierson would be singing on the record, so when I put on their ep Foreshadows on the Wall I thought wow he has a really high voice. Then when I saw the picture on the back of the cd I thought wow he looks a lot like a woman. The singer’s name is Lizzie Eldredge and she has the best I have heard since Alison Mosshart from the now defunct Discount. Her voice has that amazing quality of being both trained yet still full of emotion. She also has ability to sing in different style such as going from Motown classic “Tears of a Clown” to the country style in “The Devil's Deed Or No Noose Is Good Noose.” The band plays acoustic but not in normal folk-like manor. They don’t strum on their guitars trying to create some fake melancholy while mumbling high school poetry. They do what all greats punk bands have done and that is take the freedom offered by punk and make music that defies all labels.  I have only heard the ep so far and anxiously wait deliver of their album. As always I am late jumping on to the band wagon (ha Pun), but like most of my life I’m just glad I showed up at all.

      The six dollar tickets sounded like a good idea at the time, but having to work today in my uniform while my neck, face, arms, and scalp(hey I thought I had more hair up there)are peeling from the sunburn I go at yesterday's Dodger game the extra 4 bucks for upper reserves seats might have been worth it. There is some shade in the upper reserve seats, but in the right field pavillon it's just you the sun. The sun burn is less painful because it turned out to be a great game and The Dodgers Won. It looked rather bleak in the 9th, but The Dodgers came back to tie and put in Gange for the 10th. Cesar Izturis hit home Jose Hernadez for the winning run. The game turned around for The Dodgers when someone from the crowd yelled"Dodgers I'm baking like a turkedy out here ya gotta win." Also my sympathizes go out to Bradley Clark the right fielder for The Brewers who was harrased after getting caught in a rundown when no one was on first with a chant of "Fun-da-mentals". My biggest disapointment is that not once during the game did they play "Blitzkrieg Bop", but may be they are saving for when The Dodgers play The Yankees in June. Maybe Johnny Ramone will come and play it live.

      In   Napoleon Dynamite   (the best movie of the summer) Napoleoln's best friend Pedro runs for School President and gives one campaign speech, " Vote for me and all you dreams will come true." Those ten words are the essence of every modern political speech. No matter who the politician is or what party he or she belongs to the modern political speech is an attempt to convince people of the impossible: increase in defense/decrease in taxes for example. John Kerry's speech on Thursday was a prime example of trying to convince voters that he can make their wildest dreams come true. There is no way he can create a system of universal health care and balance the budget and stop deficit spending. President Bush I am sure will do the same with his speech and is doing the same every time he talks about fiscal responsibility, yet does not veto one spending bill from congress. Political speeches that claim the impossible is possible are not necessarily bad things because the function of speech is not to create policy, but to create hope. When Ross Perot ran for president he bored and confused people when he gave speeches with graphs and hard data to prove his points. The idea behind of speech is not give information, but to inspire people to think a particular way or vote a particular way. It was rather sad to watch a focus group on MSNBC after Kerry's speech talk about how Pollyanish and naive his speech was and more than one person said, "how he is going to pay for all that." America has become a nation of naysayers who if they have to play want to play it safe. All great things began as impossible ideas. When John Kennedy announced he wanted to go to moon science how no idea how to get there or even if it was possible. Greatness can only be achieved when their is the possibility of failure. A political speech is not meant to tell how we should do something, but why. A political speech should inspire us to begin to think about ideas like better healthcare, better, schools, and a stronger military. First we have to believe something can be achieved before we can work to achieve it.  Great political opens the doors to the believing the impossible is possible.

      Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat. -- F. Scott Fitzgerald  "Did you stay in bed all day and watch cartoons?!" "No, I got up twice to go to the bathroom."  When your life fall a part nothing is more comforting than drinking Miller High Life in bed wearing nothing but underwear watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force with bed sheets over the drapes blocking out all sunlight and eating nothing but root beer barrels of unknown origin: Living the High Life, Indeed. A Cliché' is a cliché' until they apply to you and then they become scripture. The road to hell is paved with good intention has been echoing in my head like a scream in The Grand Canyon For the last 2 weeks. My good intention was wanting to be teacher and hell is returning to the life I thought was behind me. I had one weekend in which to enjoy my future before things fell apart. You see despite what the media reports the massive teacher shortage in America has not made it any easier to become a teacher. All teachers stills need to have a credential or at least be in credential program to get a job. Normally getting a credential takes two more years of school and cost a substantial amount of money. The extra time and money is one of the reason people stay out of education. To combat this many districts have created alternative credential programs to make it easier to become a teacher. In Los Angeles one of the alternative program is called the District Intern Program in which a person receives a credential paid for by the district while teaching at a L.A. school with a beginning teacher's salary. This was perfect for me because I had a desire to be a teacher and did not want to pay nor could I afford to pay for a credential. In addition to the free credential and the teacher's salary was a stipend of $2000 dollars for the six-week initial course that was a crash course into teacher. It seemed like the perfect program, but as Posion taught us every rose has it thorn.  Not being very bright I tend to focus in on one thing at a time and had spent all of last year focusing just on getting into The District Intern Program; meaning I did not apply for any other programs or make any contingency plans. Becoming a teacher was not just about getting a new career; in many ways it meant getting a new life. All the jobs I have ever had have been out of necessity never out of desire to do whatever the job was. Teaching was going to be for the first time a job I wanted to do. The weeks leading up to the program’s start date of July 12th I spent a significant amount of money on printing resumes and portfolios for my job search. I also bought a leather portfolio that I thought would look real cool during a job interview. I even had a job interview set up for the first week of the program. The day before the program started I took a ride with my father to Mount Vernon Middle School where the program was to be held. I sat in the car with my father looking at what I thought was my future. We shared a hope filled silence that tomorrow was the start of a new life.I woke up early Monday Morning and was one of the first people to arrive. When I registered I was given two pieces of construction paper with clouds on them one-labeled dreams and the other nightmares. I took the two pieces of paper into the auditorium where a melody of Randy Newman's "I Love LA" And Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My Wings" was playing over a montage of pictures featuring smiling students and smiling teachers. I filled out my dreams and nightmares papers and was told to put them on the wall so that we could all share our fears and aspiration. My head nearly exploded from holding back the laughter," When I was told to put a star next to any dreams or nightmares I saw were the same as mine." The laughter soon died when a woman said rather loudly " Oh My God What." I turned to see what "the what" was and was informed that the $2000 stipend had been cancelled due to budget cuts. I sat there stupefied and dumbfounded reminding myself to breathe. Quickly, the news passed through the audience and after everyone had finished looking at the dreams and nightmares a speaker came to podium to make it official-  the stipend was cancelled and all my dreams were stuck on wall and my nightmares had become real.  The $2000 dollars was the only thing that made it possible for me to join the program. It would have been just enough money to pay rent and do little else until I started teaching in the fall. As I sat there the speaker's words took on the phrasing of Charlie Brown's teacher "wonk wonk wonk" suddenly I had gone from standing on the edge of tomorrow to wonder whose couch I was going have to sleep if I couldn't get my job back. I sat there for two hours listening to people who I thought of as liars tell me how great they and their program was. I thought of them as liars because I had been brought somewhere under false pretenses. They had known for two months that there was not going to be stipend, yet made no mention of it in their literature, their web page, or when you spoke to them directly. One of my reason for wanting to be a teacher was getting to work with honest dedicated people to achieve a common goal and to find them to be like everyone was one more disappointment in day filled with them. At the first break I called my old boss and asked for my job backed. At first he thought I was kidding, but the sadness of my tome showed I was not. I got my old job back, but had to go through the humiliating ordeal of explaining to everyone what had happened and why I was back.  It took a week to do the paperwork to get my job back. It was rather depressing week in which days went by without showers or even interpersonal communications. A strange thing happened after two days of sitting in my underwear drinking Miller High Life and watching Meatwad and Frylock I started feeling better than I had in long time. It was as if I was free of something I did not even realize I was chained to. Slowly, I began to open up to the fantastic possibilities of life when your young, have nothing to lose and the world open to you. My single-minded pursuit of The District Intern Program in retrospect had more to do with me wanting to make a safe choice instead of the right choice. I still want to be a teacher, but I am looking into some the more adventures way of becoming way. There are programs in Washington D.C., Mississippi, and Chicago that offer credentials or masters in exchange for teaching for two years. Maybe I liked Northern Exposure a little too much, but having tried the safe bet and failed I figure might as well bet on the long shot. I mean if your going to lose might as well lose big. I think when you lack economic security you become or rather I become overly cautious and forget that as Dylan said" When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose."  The programs I mentioned above do not start for a year, so I have time to plan my future. It has become very apparent that getting stiffed out of the two thousands dollars may have been the best thing for me. Maybe deep down I was looking for a way out anyways, but I won't give myself that much credit. I got screwed and just because something good happen because of it does not change that, nor does it get the loss of a week’s pay or money wasted on resumes and portfolios back. What I lost in money I made up for in a better understanding of who I am and what I want and that should be worth something.

      Mike Watt used to be part of band called the Madonnabes and they would play Madonna covers&nbsp; as one would expect. Their is a new group of Madonnabes who don't cover her music, but cover her approach to the media.&nbsp;Madonna's approach to the media has alway been&nbsp;shock and no&nbsp;awe in that the controversy that surrounds much of her&nbsp;work in the beginning dies down very quickly once people actually see the video or hear the song. Madonna's genius has always been in her marketing ability&nbsp;as much as in her music. Many have learned from her that you can hide mediocre talent&nbsp;behind massive amounts of style or personality. Take for example her video for&nbsp;"American Life" which she knew would never be played on Mtv with its imagary of Presient&nbsp;Geoge W. Bush being attacked, yet the controversy the video created served the same purpose as a video: adversisment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new group of Madonnabes includes Michael Moore, Ann Coulter and many others whose work does not justify the media attention they recieve. Michael Moore's movies are funny, but the information they offer is widely available and&nbsp;the films themselves&nbsp;look like crap.&nbsp; Similar to The Passion of the Christ, Farenheit 911 had so much free publicity from its supposed controversial nature that it was predestine to be a hit. Just as I could predict where every scene and every nutball theory was going in Farenheit 911 I&nbsp;can predict the content of every column by Ann Coulter before it is every published. Her columns are little more than a mantra Bush Good Democrats Evil. Her work possess little insight or intellegence and she&nbsp;is best known for taking a ridiculous propostion and arguing for it. In her book Treason she defends Joseph McCarthy and his tactics and claims the Democratic party itself&nbsp;has commited treason and should be tried. Like Moore the quality of her work does not merit the attention it recieves, but the media knows it easier to sell her and Moore's moronic over-simplified opinions than it is to engage in thoughtul reasonable&nbsp;discourse. Also similar to Madonna both have made a career of taking ideas out the mainsteam into the mainstream and then taking credit for them. Madonna has for years taken music out of the underground and brought it mainsteam. Moore and Coulter do the same with ideas. Moore's ideas about The Carlyle Group have been floating around the internet&nbsp;long before President Bush every took office and Coulter's column are basically trasnscripts of right-wing talk radio.&nbsp; The major difference betweenThe Madonnabes and Madonna is that Madonna actually believes in what she says and does and the others do not. When Madonna's Sex Book came out I really believe in her own mind she saw it as a work of art and not as really expensive copy of Hustler. For Coulter and Moore they have become very rich off becoming ideological personalities that do little the more than play to their audience like a puppy desperate for attention. I don't believe either one believes what they say or could make a valid argument for what they claim to believe in.&nbsp; At least when Madonna sings "Like a Virgin" I believe her. It does feel like being touched for the first time. --Along with Coulter and Moore I would add Ted Rall, &nbsp;Bill O'Reily, Sean Hannity&nbsp;as blowhard hacks whose major talent is being on radio, television, and in magazines constantly without having anything interesting to say or write.

Poetry should unite the mysteries of life with mysteries of language and leave the reader with more questions than answers. The poems of the poets on the show are so obvious in intent that the only mystery is how did they get on the show. Most often the intent of the&nbsp;poetry is to express a political opinion that would be better stated in an essay or if the poem deals with relationships the intent is to try and get laid. The political poems are the most nausiating because the politics are basically a mantra Bush Bad America Bad Evil Evil. One poet actually made the ridiculous assertion that the misogny women face in America is equel to or worse than the misojny in the Middle East. Now while their is no doubt there is&nbsp;misojny in America to compare it to the way women are treated in countries like Sauid Arabia is moronic and belittles the struggle of womem in the Middle East. While the unrealistic images of woman in magazine and on TV has a negative effect it cannot be compared such incidents as when a group of teenage girls were beaten in the streets for running out of school without their faces covered even though the school was on fire. Even worse than the idea behind the poem was how poorly it was written. One line in particular stuck out where&nbsp;he gives a list of cities that include "Montreal, Madrid, and New York City." Even the most basic creative writing class teachs alliteration and instead of New York City he should have written Manhattan for sheer rhythmic and aestic quality. The one highlight of the show was MC Lyte at end who wrote a poem from the heart that had style and wit.&nbsp;A poet's only job is to improve on the blank page and sadly for most of these poets they have not.

      Old people get treated like crap today. We hide them in nursing homes and visit them more out of duty than love. We forget their sacrifices and accomplishment and would rather watch a movie about World War 2 than talk to somebody who was there. Next time you see an old man or woman remember he might have stormed the beaches at Normandy and she might have risked her life as a Freedom Rider going down to Mississippi to register black people to vote in the early 1960's. We forget that the old were once young and that some day we will be old as well. Movies being a reflection of society, old people are rarely given roles above stereotypes, caricatures, or to fill in holes in the plot. The wise old black man, the old lady with the dirty mouth, and the old narrator who is in the first two minutes and last two minutes of a movie are 95% of the roles for old people in movies. It's as if Logan's Run was taken literally in Hollywood. The main reason for this is that most moviegoers are under the age of 25 and want to see movies in which they can envision themselves as the hero no matter how stupid the plot is. The two biggest franchises during the last ten years have been The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. Both franchise made tons of money and was discussed as if they were deep and serious films when in reality they were pretensions, preachy, and confusing. The first Matrix movie was the only one of the three that was actually a good movie. The other two suffered from trying to answer the questions raised in the first one with answers that were not as interesting as the questions. Even worse is that so many people bought into the philosophical non-sense these films spewed. All of sudden I had to listen to everyone cretin with $8.50 talk about deconstruction and the nature of reality while finding some deep meaning in anagrams (Neo=One Whoa) that any 5 year old could figure out. All these deep thinkers never bothered to talk about how the films don't make any sense because how could the machines be so powerful that they can take over the world, yet cannot kill this small group of humans. The dumbest idea in the movie is that man would intentionally black out the Sun to stop the machines even though in that would cause a nuclear winter and the Earth would not be able to produce any food leading to mass starvations. Reality should never get in the way of a good story, but it is only a good story when reality is suspended by the story. The Lord of the Rings like The Matrix is little more than an adolescent power fantasy wrapped around 100 million dollars in special effects. To be fair I have never liked fantasy films or books and I got confused when I tried to play Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons in high school, so Lord of the Rings was not my thing to begin with. My criticism is not based upon subject matter, but on content. The Lord of the Rings is way too long (as this post is rapidly becoming, I promise I am getting to Bubba Ho-Tep) and the movie uses too much symbolic imagery in the costumes, white and pretty for good and black and ugly for bad, to make up for the confusing plot for it to rise above the level of a typical "blockbuster" that looks good, but is as deep as puddle. There is nothing wrong with shallow good-looking movies as long as they are not taken seriously. The last Lord of the Rings movie won best picture last year at the Oscars over Mystic River and Seabiscuit illustrating the triumph of style over substance. Why watch a movie with human relationships when you can watch orgs smash everything? The disturbing part of The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings perceived profundity is that young people have found so much meaning is these inhuman incoherent power fantasies. A line from Bukowski that has always stuck in my head "young men dreaming of pussy and victory" sums up the appeal of these films to young people especially young men. Both films don't allow any reality in to bum out little Johnny's power trip fantasy of blowing people away with machine guns or catapults.  Bubba Ho-Tep on one level is about Elvis and a Black JFK fighting a soul sucking demon, but it also about the pains both physical and mental of growing old, friendship, and trying to have some dignity in a society that denies it to you in every way. The two most touching moments in the film are when Bruce Campbell takes his dead roommate’s purple heart of the trash after the dead man's daughter throws it away and when Campbell and Ossie Davis share a couple of Baby Ruth candy bars. The scene with the Purple Heart speaks louder about the treatment of veterans in society than all two plus hours of Saving Private Ryan. The scene with the candy bars illustrates how we turn old people into children by treating them like children. The scene in which Ossie Davis asks Bruce Campbell if he wants a "dingdong" is very funny, but it also very sad because here is two grown men who have to hide that their eating candy bars. The major theme of the film is that even when history is ignored it does not fade away. The soul-sucking mummy is history coming back to bite us in the ass or rather suck out our souls through our assholes. An Elvis with a hip problem and black JFK represents a different idea about history and that is -history becomes what we believe it to be. The film leaves it open to the viewer if Elvis and JFK are the actual historical figure they believe themselves to be in the film. Like the movie, history is all about what you believe in. JFK and Elvis are perfect figures to show this because people won't let Elvis die and JFK is more famous for his death than his life. JFK is better known today for the conspiracies theories that surround his death than for his presidency and each Elvis sighting is a way for fans to control their idol by denying him death. History is what we make of if because we are what we make of ourselves. If the characters Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are real thing is of little importance because they believe they are the real people. Their decision to fight The Bubba Ho-Tep is their fight to regain their spot in history by taking a stand against a monster that wants to suck out their soul and send it down the toilet. Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis give phenomenal performance and should have received recognition for their work. Ossie Davis takes an insane idea that JFK was dyed black and had a bag of sand put inside his head and turns it into a something that seems possible. A less talented actor would have over acted and done a caricature of JFK, but Davis plays it straight adding a needed realistic quality to a film that could easily have turned into a joke of a film. Campbell's performance also could have become a caricature of Elvis with a curled lip and saying "Thank you, Thank very much" every time someone gave him something, but he doesn't he gives depth and humanity to Elvis who is usually shown as being a hick and a buffoon. Charlize Theron got an Oscar for playing a fat serial killer that looked like Jon Voight as all pretty actress do when they play someone ugly just like Nicole Kidman the year before. Bruce Campbell does something similar, but didn't receive anything. If you want to see great acting look at the scene where Bruce Campbell has to go down a hill with his walker. He is able to capture the whole film in that one scene because it illustrated he had the courage to take back his dignity. A film about JFK and Elvis fighting a mummy in a nursing home could easily have been done as a parody with one joke stretched over 90 minutes, but Bubba Ho-Tep uses horror genre to tell a story that Hollywood no longer wants to tell. The film is more about friendship and having dignity even when the world denies it to you than about Elvis or Mummies.

      The only thing I every wanted be in life was a roadie for Black Flag on their 84' "My War" tour, but seeing as how they broke up in 1986 when I was 8 I don't see that happening. Of course, if Mr. Peabody can get that time machine working , but then again he is a cartoon dog, so I don't see that happening soon either. If there is anyone reading this blog I would first like to say thank you and that you know I recently had my dreams of becoming a teach crushed by the cruel forces of budgets cuts. For the first time in a long time I have time to think about my life and what is it I want from it. For the past 3 years I having been going 7 days a week-5 days of work 2 days at school. This schedule left me little time for anything beyond working towards a goal that a month ago I thought I had achieved. In those 3 years I lost contact with most of my friends and what little social life I had has evaporated into playing Hearts with parents on weekends and leaving big tips at the local coffee house hoping the girl behind the counter remembers me. I was blinded by the light at the end of the tunnel and have just learned that the tunnel never ends and the light keeps getting further away. I wanted to be teacher for many reasons, but mostly it was the only job I thought would be worth doing everyday to the best of my abilities. I work hard at my current job, but I also watch the clock like a prisoner counting down the days to his release. I always told myself I would never confuse who I am with what I do, but in America the two are so connected they almost cannot be separated. The first question people ask you at a party, " So what do you do?"  allows them to  classify you into a group they have created in their own minds with a particular set of traits. If you don't think this is true asked yourself what comes to mind when you here someone is doctor and another person is a garbage man. Based upon a job we make assumption that may or may not be true about a person. I wanted to say I was a teacher, because I like the assumptions people make when you tell them your a teacher. I think in life we all try to find something to serve. Some higher purpose whethers it be country, god, or our family that will lend meaning to our lives: For me that higher purpose was teaching. Now there is nothing stopping me from becoming a teacher it will just take longer than I thought. Great just what I need more time to think.

      A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds-Ralph Waldo Emerson  The Republican Party decision to attack John Kerry and the Democratic party for engaging in an Extreme Make over (  urlLink http://www.demsextrememakeover.com/  ) is stupid seeing as how nothing is more popular in America toady than extreme make over. The sheer number of make over reality shows like  Queer for the Straight Guy, Ambush Make Over,  and  Extreme Make Over  demonstrate that the idea of a make over is not a bad thing to Americans. Americans not only want to make over themselves, but their homes- Trading Spaces , their jobs- Help Wanted,  their mothers-  Trading Spouses:Meet Your New Mommy . Maybe Republican Party is out of touch because to come down hard on something so popular is rather dumb. It may not be the best strategy to paint negatively something a large part of the country is doing. The Republicans must have decided to use extreme make over because of its pop cultural ties and making their people say flip-flop over and over again made them sound to have the vocabulary of a ten year old. I don't know if The Democrats are engaging in an extreme make over, but I do they are more boring than every and I didn't think that was possible. Moreover, make over seem to be fundamental to American culture. In many ways the American Dream is a hope to have an extreme make over. From the pilgrims to the pioneers that headed west to modern day immigrants, America represents a chance to make over your life. One of the most common themes in American literature is idea of self-invention or an extreme make over.  The Great Gatsby  is the story of a man who engages in an extreme make over to win the love of his life. Fitzgerald writes that Jay Gatsby, "sprang from his own Platonic conception of himself" which is exactly Americans have always tried to do. With poll numbers around 50% for everything such as" is the country going in the right direction" an extreme make over may not be the worst idea. Everyone hates Congress, so why not on November 2nd vote for the challenger no matter who he or she is- now that would be an extreme make over. Of course this won't happen because both parties have germinated the country to the point only a handful of seats will even have a challenger to the incumbent. If only both parties would engage in an extreme make over I might be able to tell them apart. Stay the course in Iraq, affordable healthcare, better schools, less taxes, more defense spending, is that an echo I hear nope it just the parties debating the issues. If only The Queer Eye guys could make over the debates they would still be superficial, but at least they would be color coordinated.
