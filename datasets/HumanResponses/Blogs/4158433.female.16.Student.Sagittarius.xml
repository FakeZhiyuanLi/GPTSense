       She lived like she knew nothing lasts   Didn't care to look like anyone else   And she was beautiful, so beautiful   I still hear her laugh like she's here      Shower it down on all the young   It isn't so wrong to have such fun...      Forever  angel , I hope they love you like we do   Forever  angel , I'll be proud to be like you   Be like you (I'll be proud to be like you)      Does the sun shine up at you when you're looking down?   Do you get along with the others around?   It's got to be better than before   You don't need to worry now you're gone...      Forever  angel , I hope they love you like we do   Forever  angel , I'll be proud to be like you   Be like you, just like you...      And when I go to sleep at night   I'll thank you for each blessed thing surrounding me   For every fall I'll ever break      Each moment's breath I wanna taste   Confidence and conscience, decadent extravangance   Never ending providence, for loving when I had the chance       Angel , I hope they love you like we do   Forever  angel , I'll be proud to be like you   Forever  angel , I'll be proud to be like you   Be like you   I'll be proud to be like you

      The night falls in a heavy, suffocating cloak, entwined are we. The emotion for which you lust flares once, then dies, devoured by the all-encompassing dark. All hope must sicken and die. Your passion throbs no more. How could you cause such hurt? Demons surround us, crying, We are Fallen.

       I really  don't get you  right now, you tried everything you could think of to get at me, yet i give you one thing to do and you  back down , aim for  another target .    I don't get you anymore,  Are you crazy !?    Because right now this is no way of going about getting me to have some kind of  feelings   for you  anymore.    I was  seriously thinking  you know, maybe just  maybe things could work , but  you blew it  all, and you know what, i'm  not  going to  let myself  be set up, just so that  you  can  drag me down , again!   This is it,  never again.    I'm  gone.

        I search across the miles,     And wonder if you're out there.     If you can hear me..     Or feel these feelings I have.     Can you see how much i've missed you?     Does it even matter anymore?     Sometimes I just wish you'd die     So my life could be clear.     So I could go about my life     Day to day, Full of bliss, and peace.     But, You've consumed me too much.     And too far inside.     The worms of your lies, pain...     Eat me up inside.     There's no cure for the disease you've given to me.     Maybe someday....I'll finally be free.

           Wanderin' these lonely streets   Runnin' out of time   I try so hard to make it through   To the finish line.   And i look up to the starry skies   and wish upon a star.   That i can make it through this   and ill end up goin' far.   And then I start to fall   As I look up to death's glance   And then you come down   And save me from it all   My angel of reassurance   my light inside the dark   You help me find my way again   And rekindle my sparks.   You take my hand and lead me through   help me start to stride   And you show me that im beautiful   and heal all my pride   and when night fades to day   you look at me and say   Even when it gets dark again   Ill help along the way   Ill always be there to guide you   when things seem a little too hard   and I will always love you   when you feel alone.   So remember my fallen angel   It's because of you      That I kept on goin' and didn't become so blue.

       I  don't quite know  what i am  feeling  anymore, and even when i just  sit and write,  even then  i can come  out with the  most weird   stuff . I can't  believe what i write  anymore, because i have told myself  over and over  again exactly how  i should feel , and what i  should think . But i guess life isn't  that easy.    So heres  what i wrote  last night. It's  nothing too special .        :S

           L   ost   in my thoughts    another  lonely  night   without  you  near by    and far out of  sight     Over  and  Over     Repeating  in my head    How could you  leave  me   Was it what i  said ?   I  tried  so hard    I ripped  flesh  from  bone     Just to  give you  affection   A place to  call home .   But be as it may    Those  words never helped     You  decided  to play    and  leave me  here  alone.

       There are only  two  foods in existence ( pot noodle  and  airline food ) where the  packaging  has more  flavour  and  nutrition   value  than the  contents!
