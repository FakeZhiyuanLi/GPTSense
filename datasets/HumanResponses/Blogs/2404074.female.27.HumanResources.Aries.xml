       -=LoVe iS oNLy A FeeLiNg=-    The first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met And i knew that to you and into your life i had to get i felt light-headed at the touch of this strangers hand an assault my defences systematically failed to withstand  cos you came at a time  when the pursuit of one true love in which to fall was the be all and end all  love is only a feeling (drifting away) when im in your arms i start believing (its here to stay) but love is only a feeling Anyway  the state of elation that this union of hearts achieved i had seen, i had touched, i had tasted and i truly believed that the light of my life would tear a hole through each cloud that scudded by just to beam on you and i  Love is only a feeling (drifting away) when im your arms i start believing (its here to stay) but love is only a feeling anyway, anyway  Love is only a feeling (drifting away) and we've got to stop ourselves believing (its here to stay) cos love is only a feeling Anyway

       -=Hemorrhage=-    Memories are just where you laid them  Dragging the waters til the depths give up their dead  What did you expect to find?  Was it something you left behind?  Don't you remember anything I said when I said  Don't fall away  And leave me to myself Don't fall away  And leave love bleeding in my hands  In my hands again  And leave love bleeding in my hands In my hands  Love lies bleeding   Oh hold me now I feel contagious  Am I the only place that you've left to go?  She cries her life is like  Some movie in black and white  Dead actors faking lines Over and over and over again she cries   Don't fall away  And leave me to myself Don't fall away  And leave love bleeding in my hands  In my hands again  And leave love bleeding in my hands In my hands  Love lies bleeding   And I watched as you turned away  You don't remember, but I do  You never even tried   Don't fall away  And leave me to myself Don't fall away  And leave love bleeding in my hands  In my hands again  And leave love bleeding in my hands In my hands  Love lies bleeding

       =My iMMoRTaL=    i'm so tired of being here suppressed by all my childish fears and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave 'cause your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears i held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating life now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone but though you're still with me i've been alone all along

       -=SuaTu MaSa=-    Bagaimanakan ku mula Dan apakah kata-kata Yang indah untuk diabadikan Tiap wajah berkisah Tiap madah bererti Manakah ilhamku  Cahaya di matamu Senyum di bibirmu mengukir seribu tanda pertanyaan Mungkinkah kau jua dalam kerinduan Di saat begini aku merindukah  Berhelai-helai surat Terbiar di depanku Tak dapat aku utuskan Ku ramas semua Dan ku buangkan Jauh dari pandangan  Lalu aku kesal Ku kumpul semula Tak dapat ku nyatakan apa yang ku rasa Jika engkau tahu di dalam hatiku Mungkinkah kau sahut jeritan batinku  Dengarkanlah panggilanku Dengarkanlah lagu untukmu Angin lalu kau sampaikan Rasa rindu yang membara Kepadanya  Warna-warna cintaku Kian pudar bersama Malam yang gelap gelita Entahkan kau rasakan Apa yang aku rasa Atau kau tak endah  Tapi ku percaya Semua telah tertulis Dan niat suciku takkan disiakan Dan di suatu masa Di hari yang indah Ku hulur tanganku Lalu kau terima

       -=ReLaKu PuJuK=-    Ku dikejar bayang bayang resah Bila hatimu masih tak berubah  Enggan di punya dan di penjara Belaian cintaku ini  Aku bukan lelaki yang tewas Bisa menyambar walau ku di tolak Biar diuji kanan dan kiri Kau kan tetap ku miliki   Tiada lafaz yang lebih agung Kalimah cintamu yang ku tunggu-tunggu Biar jasadku yang menanggung Permainan darimu rela ku pujuk  Janganlah kau salahkan aku Terus memburu menawan cintamu Daku percaya sedikit masa  Kau kecundang akhirnya  Usahlah kau bersedih di hadapanmu aku hadir Memadam resah dan curiga dari hatimu oh Apakah kali ini bisa kau tolak dan berlari Setelah aku menanamkan azimatku

       -=JaNuaRi=-    Berat beban ku...meninggalkanmu  Separuh nafas jiwaku sirna  Bukan salahmu apa dayaku  Mungkin benar cinta sejati  Tak berpihak pada kita    Kasih ku sampai disini  Kisah kita jangan tangisi keadaannya  Bukan kerna kita berbeza  Dengarkan...dengarkan lagu   Lagu ini melodi rintihan hati ini  Kisah kita berakhir di Januari    Selamat tinggal kisah sejatiku  Pergilah....    Dengarkan lagu  Lagu ini melodi rintihan hati ini  kisah kita berakhir..berakhir...berakhir...di Januari  Berakhir Di Januari

       -=KaSiH TaK SaMPai=-    Indah.. Terasa indah.. Bila kita terbuai dalam alunan cinta.. Sedapat mungkin terciptakan rasa.. Keinginan saling memiliki  Namun bila, Itu semua dapat terwujud Dalam satu ikatan cinta Tak semudah seperti yang pernah terbayang.. Menyatukan perasaan....  Tetaplah menjadi bintang dilangit Agar cinta kita akan abadi Biarlah sinarmu tetap menyinari alam ini, Agar menjadi saksi cinta kita Berdua... Berdua..  Sudah.. Lambat sudah... Kini semua harus berakhir Mungkin inilah jalan yang terbaik Dan kita mesti relakan kenyataan ini  Menjadi saksi kita berdua....
