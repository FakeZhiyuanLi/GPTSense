      Thats what it was, it should never have happened, and now i just want to curl up and die, it meant nothing to him and i shouldn't have got caught up in it. I feel worse now, i can't move on yet i can't try and make things work, it sucks. I just want him, and i can't and i can't believe i contemplated asking him about things. Its wrong and never going to happen.  ~Lisa~

      I really have fallen for him, its amazing how all thoughts of Carlos and anyone else drift out of my head and i spend all my time wondering why did he kiss? Why did he just say do it, and why did it feel so good? Why did his hands know where to settle? Why did he say he had been thinking about me a lot, and then say, no i really have, why did he tell me my kissing was still amazing, and why did he lie about the amount of girls hes kissed... And why do i have to care, its because i DO care, and i can't help it, i've always cared, and i always will, no one understand what it is about him that makes me like him, want him, need him, care for him, and maybe love him, i can't actually think about that word. Hes always been there, always listened and always looked out for me, and understood, he was kind, considerate and so what if stubborn and always right? Thats him, i don't just like him for his good parts ;-) I like him for him, thats it, thats why, he made me feel so special, so lovely and so loved, and when it went away i couldn't cope, and i still can't cope getting too close, this is a perfect example, he kisses me a few times, and i totally blow it out of proportion, i honestly don't know if i could get back with him, but i wouldn't mind, just trying, giving him my trust, i think deep down we could make it work, he still has my heart under lock and key and i can't claim it back off him which makes it worse, if i could have taken it back then i wouldn't have this trouble to find someone else to like, to need, i can't handle the thought of him being with anyone, and me not being with him, not having his kids or being married, its what i wanted, and what i had wanted when i first met him, he was my Prince.   ~Lisa~

      That just about sums it up, i think i've fallen for him again, but i think i can control it, its just a lust thing, just i need to sleep with him thing, i don't want anyone else right now, its him, his body, his touch, and the way he kissed me, especially that last kiss, we knew that Tom was going to be coming in the doors and he just grabbed me and his body against mine, his hands all over me and that oh so lovely feeling of pleasure as we kissed, and hes still an amazing kisser... Damn him, and damn him for being wanted, and i know hes been with other girls and i know he won't tell me, but i still feel like there is something there, the way he looks at me, and holds my gaze, and we laugh together, its just me, being silly and wanting more than i can get, why does he have to go meet Mandy? Or why does he have to like other people, all i want is sex... He may have had sex in the past 7 months but i haven't and its doing me in.   ~Lisa~

      I had to tell someone and as no one knows this, no one will find out, technically? I kissed Jason, several times in fact, and each time was just as passionate as the last, i want him so bad, i'm hungry for him, he kissed me and i just melted, my hands were on his neck, and his back, and kissing him and his neck, and his hands were on my arse and sides, and then we walked off and we were up against a wall and my hands were grazing his chest and i was kissing and biting his neck and i could hear his breathing slow and deep and feel his body pressed against mine, i have to have him, i will have him. He wanted me and the moment his lips touched mine i wanted him and his breathing and his hands told me that, i just want to have him all to myself, satisfy this need just for him, i look at him and i need him so badly, i can hardly keep it to myself, i just need him, once, well maybe more than that, and maybe he needs me, i'm going to get him, i'm going to get him, tease and touch him until he can't handle it.   ~Lisa~

      What a fucker to do it to him all over again?   Anyway, Dave, hehe, we seem to be getting on well, sometimes a bit ackward at first but then its all fine, and i quite like him and hopefully i'll be staying over his on my own on Sat night... Hopefully anyway, hes nice and we'll see, its the first time i've felt like this since Jason so i don't want to ruin it...  ~Lisa~

      Wondering why it says my star sign is a capricorn? When i'm taurus? But hey.. And i can't be arsed to go back and re-read these again to take out spelling mistakes, bit of a perfectionist... So bored this is like my third post today, no one online as i'm on inset day, and so i'm bored... Emailed Dave, might talk to him later, once i've been paid i'll be so much more happy, this month has really taught me to save my money and not go blowing it on nice mobiles...   ~Lisa~

      You see i can't understand how Laura can change from last Thursday telling Marc she still loved him to getting over him and deciding she wants Jason? I mean maybe i am biased as you know what i feel for Jason. As much as he hurt me i don't want him hurt, well part of me does, part of me wants him to see how much it actually hurts to be cheated on or played around with. I mean, Jason is practically a lie in himself,he doesn't know how to be faithful or be honest, and thats him, thing is i believed him when he said to me he had changed, which sucks, because when it dawns on you that he hasn't it hurts much more to realise what an idiot you have been... He said he loved me? Maybe i have a stupid opinion of love? Maybe i don't know what it is? But i know i am never going to use it out of context again, i did love him but it doesn't felt like he loved me, i wonder if he will now throw out the book? I hope not, i was trying to work out whether i would want it or not, i should just say no, throw it, maybe if i knew he was throwing it out it would make me understand more? What i can't understand is how he can lay all over me on Wedsneday night, be nice to me and flirty, and constantly remind me of the past, talk about this Emily that he likes and then the next day he is going to get with Laura? He is playing mind games and i don't have the mental strength to work them out and try and get back on him. Eliot was right to yell at me, its pathetic, i just really really want Jason to kick himself and want me back, i'm not expecting it, but for that to happen would be great. Carlos... Not much going on, just want to be his mate, and i don't want anything else. Dave... Now i am having trouble working out what i want with him, i catch myself thinking about him a bit, and wanting to text him.. We get on well when we talk online, which is cool, but when we saw each other Weds night, we were both a bit distant, i just needed the guts to go over and talk to him, i impressed him with getting over the fence though! Even though i almost tripped over! But again Jason was there, and i was talking to him and he was being nice and i was so confused at it all. I am easily confused it seems. I am so glad no one actually knows about this blog, its full of stupid crap about Jason, its all pointless. In a way i don't want him and Laura to work, but in another i do, as then i might be over him, its going to be very hard to see them together, if they are going out? At the cartoon or whatever, kissing etc, and i keep thinking he'll call her things he did to me, and it all seemed special with me but its not when he says it to everyone... Who knows, i'd love to think deep down in his heart, he does still care, when he hears a certain song, or reads the book if he ever does, but he doesn't dwell on the past, and i can't seem to shrug if off me. I'll be paid soon, and that means i will be able to go out, maybe i'll get Dave to come with me?   ~Lisa~

      Everything he said to me was right, he had to be harsh, i need someone to be harsh, to make me stop, i don't know what it is, and i don't know why i care, and i don't want to still love him, depsite that fact i think i do... And i don't follow him and stuff, we're mates, but its harder for me as he now has Laura. I couldn't sleep for imagining what they will do, the walks, talks, hugs etc. Sleeping with each other, him calling her his baby, things he would have said to me, he'll say to her, becase i just know he will. Eliots right about him being a cheater, and a player, but it will be easier for them to make it work as he is at her college, i would hate to see them have a long time relationship, as hard as that is and mean, i will hate it, i want him back.   ~Lisa~

Dave i like but i'm not sure... We'll see. Why say no you don't want to marry me? Why think you ever wanted to get engaged in the first place? STUPID STUPID person. Laying on my stomach? Sticking his tongue out, talking about sex, having control over me, i need to resist him, and stop thinking about it all, wanting him but hating him, and wanting to not hear about it, Laura, and Emily, and i just ignore it and tell him they are silly and they should like him, but hes not really anymore successful than me in getting people? He has these flings but no one seems to want to get serious, and i don't want marriage, i don't want love, i just want him, we worked, and he knows it, its why he reminds me of everything, and its why he still cares etc, bastard, wanker, cunt!   ~Lisa~

      I got a lift from Jason today, i got a lovely look, well i think! From him when i got out the car, he was leaning over and i just said thanks and have fun at the practise, and i got a sad, kind of smile, and i just wanted to hug him... Aww, i miss him soooooooooooooo much its mad, and i miss him more the more time i spend with him, yet i still wana spend time with him, and i have Carlos texting me and Dave, and then all i want is the one thing that is the furthest to get... So close but so far as they say, well i've got an inset day Fri, then work Sat and Sun, then college until Thurs and Fri when i have work shadowing, then i have three days of careers stuff then two days at college then three days of college and two days in France, then three days and we leave, thank fuck! Looks long but not long to go now...   ~Lisa~

      ... Was weird, i got picked up by Jason in his car with Tom at 7.15, and drove to Dave's, we then went to the pub in Redhill and stayed there for a bit, then me and Jason went to Crawley to get Kathryn and her mate as Jason likes her said he'd take her home, then we drove back to Dave's, where we stayed the night, my folks actually let me stay at his when they don't know him etc but they wouldn't let me stay at Jason's for the night when they knew him etc? Pissed me off a bit, thinking of all the sex me and Jason could have had.. Lol! Anyway stuff happened with Dave, kissing and fondling and he went down on me which was really good! Hes really gentle, but for some reason whenever someone tells me like Jason and Tom did that Dave is really into me i feel a bit weird as i don't know if i'm into him as much? We'll see, plus i was too busy trying to eye up Jason's chest.. He spoke about him being annoyed at my parents never letting me stay over and spoke about the necklace he gave me and arghhhhhh...  ~Lisa~

      I spent some time with Joanne as its been cool, we've caught up and had a laugh, and i keep hearing loads of stuff from Laura about Jason and Marc, oh to be her and have him wanting me.. I can dream... Anyway, got college for two days now then weekend, and going out tomorrow night, its weird Dave seems intersted? But i dunno... Anyway, i can't wait to be paid, still love Jason, still trying not to love him... Everything else is cool and i'm ok...  ~Lisa~

      They slept together again, and he really likes her but nothing is happening yet but i love him, i really do, and seeing him makes it harder and i want to be with him, and i feel confused, and i told him about Carlos because we were talking about love lives, and it hurt when he said how Laura held him and it felt right, felt my heart snap. I feel shit about Carlos, and i have no money and i feel rough and i just want Jason. How do i make it clear that i could make him so happy! JASON I LOVE YOU, I WANT TO BE WITH YOU, FOREVER, PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS... Maybe this has sent some kind of mental message to him, i always try and be there even if i fuck up, or say something bad. And he spoke to me yesterday, and just spoke about Eliot and then Laura, and stuff. Oh, bollocks!   ~Lisa~

      I finally got told by Laura what happened between her and Jason, in the past that is, and he started the kiss etc. Anyway onto me, i slept with Carlos today, and i was rather dissappointed by it all and feel that i have been spoilt by Jason, damn him. It really is nothing to talk about, it was the definition of a quickie... But hey, nothing more interesting to say...  ~Lisa~

      Thats five now, Ami, Me, Kirstie, Lianne and now Laura. And this time he actually says he cared about Laura but shes still caught up on Marc... One word, HA! But it makes me feel down and i've realised that all the time i've had to put off feelings for Carlos has made me move on from him, and that yes i fancy him and hes a great mate but i don't think i could be in a relationship... Plus i still have issues with being hurt and shit and i feel bad enough him cheating on Ronnie with me..  I want to be with someone but i'm looking for the right person instead of just having fun which sucks. I just want a casual, happy relationship, with someone who i can care for and trust but someone i am not in love with and someone who is just nice. I wish i wasn't in **** with Jason, i don't even want to put his name and that word in the same sentence, i am trying to get rid of him, but i want to still be there. Caught up on a rollercoaster of emotions and i hate them and it and i must have no will power or anything to make myself hate the bloke, its why i have to be slightly mean and sarcastic, so i don't say anything else. But i swear he spoke about Laura and how he was used and the ignored on purpose? How he slept with her and then hoped they could get together and then she told him she was still caught up on Marc... I feel happy that she did that but when Tom told me they were just hugging etc afterwards like a couple and how much he liked it makes me feel worse, i can imagine it, i had images of them on the way home.   ~Lisa~

      Well it turns out that Carlos has got a thing for me, and wants to take it further, we spent a nice day together, kissed, which i did not plan on considering hes still with Ronnie... And we had to chat about stuff, i couldn't tell him i didn't think i could go out with him because i still had feelings for Jason. Thats not fair, thats not his problem, its mine, and i should deal with them as i see right. Jason has Laura round now and i'm sure hes making a play for her... I don't think she likes him like that but she does have reputation... Thats just wrong of me..  ~Lisa~

      Everyone seems happy but me, everyone seems to have someone, or be getting someone or not want someone. I'd like someone, someone to take my mind off things and have some fun with, i could have had that with Carlos but i got scared, scared of being hurt, scared of completely losing Jason and scared of the breaking up despite us being not being together... I'm happy for everyone who has someone or who's happy because they want to be single, but i just wish i could find someone... Someone kind, considerate, sexy and funny and someone who won't judge me for the mistakes or still liking my ex... As that is always a big problem. I find myself thinking about every guy that i meet. And this fucking candybar, i thought winding him up for a laugh between me and Ami would be funny, now he won't fucking go...  ~Lisa~

      I'm bored and still angry at myself and him, i'm hoping deep down he does care, and that he kissed me because he was confused about everything, and maybe he does like me, but got scared... I can't believe that he kissed me three times purely because i was there, or maybe i can? And he really is the player hes made out to be.. I totally understand about the band, and going to Brighton being the band and not being at rehersals, i like being there and seeing how they all just fit music wise and make something work. Its inspiring... Maybe hes just doing it because we fell out and he doesn't want me there... I still wish i'd never said a thing, and that Tom and Lianne hadn't said anything, i trusted them.. Hoped they wouldn't say anything, as i knew it wasn't going anywhere, and i liked him being nice, even if he wasn't going to live up expectations. I wish i could trust him, and like him, and believe him, makes me sad when i know i can't as i know i couldn't trust him properly. I know i need a new man to get my claws into, something fun and casual as i couldn't do anything serious yet. I feel too much, too young, and its wrong. I need to have some fun, i've got some goals for myself.  * I am going to get my belly button pierced and my ear.  * I am going to restyle and colour my hair. * I am going to start saving money for driving lessons as the more i go out  the more i get interested in it. * I am going to take my mind off Jason and try and concentrate on me and something else.  Think thats all, slightly more positive than the rest of my posts, i just know i'll never get my hopes up anymore, about anything, i have to resists, and live in hope the he does/did love me.   ~Lisa~

      I realise that i am actually alone, i hate it and i want to turn back time and change, but i never realise i've made mistakes until they are done and i can't change them.. I stupidly thought i could go to Brighton with them, i should have realised that it wasa band thing and even if it wasn't Jason doesn't want me there, i'm sure it wasn't Loz it was me who was in the way on Monday. I don't blame him, i should have kept my mouth shut and not said anything, but as usual i did the opposite. I feel like i can't really ever be proper mates with Lianne as he will always be there, always not liking it, i feel like Tom says everything to make me happy as he just wants to impress and i feel like Jason hates me with a passion. Really is completely over and i should have accepted it a long time ago. But he should not have kissed me, never, in a million years should he have done it to me, he knew what would happen and he did it on purpose, and i fell into the trap, again and again... I need to pick myself up, yet again, take myself out yet again, and depend on myself yet a fucking gain. There is no one, or nothing for me, and there definately isn't anyone for him, he deserves no one. I know i'll move on and be even stronger, the way things are going i'm going to be so fucking stronge by the time i finally hate him. I'm not going to be able to be hurt by anyone. I should have got stronger a long time ago... Hes not worth it, hes not worth it, hes not worth it... I'm not worth it in his eyes, so hes not worth it in mine.   ~Lisa~

      Why did i not realise he was just leading me on, why did i think for one minute he was serious? About anything... He never will be serious about anything, apart from his band, yes that he is serious about and i shouldn't have spoken to him, as its probably stressed him out and now hes got this deadline. I can't pretend i don't give a fuck, because i do, and i can't believe some of the things that he said, made a mistake loving me, he just keeps on making mistakes, he keeps losing his senses, keeps being a prick, thats what he does, and i fool for it and think everytime he will change, give him some time, some belief, some nice thoughts he'll not cheat, he'll not lie, he'll not hurt, but thats what he does best, hurt, cheat and lie, and he will continue to do it for the rest of his life, sure he'll be able to make up amazing lyrics on all the shit he does, or maybe he won't be able to tell the truth from the lies as he lies so much? Maybe he will end up lonely, well he will, there will be no one out there who will be bothered as people don't like liars and cheaters and people who seem to get a kick out of hurting others. He's two faced and stubborn and i refuse to love him anymore, refuse to think thats hes better than me, i am better than him and i deserve to be happy, where as he doesn't he deserves to be alone forever. Him and his sentimental guitar and shit, i just wish we'd never got togther, so what if we had fun at the time, we don't have fun now and things will never be the same, i put my heart on the line once too often for him, and now its not happening again, i will continue to fight with all my feelings until i feel nothing for him, nothing at all, no love, no hate, no nothing, hes not worth it and maybe when he realises he's not worth it he'll realise how much hes made mistakes.  ~Lisa~

      I wanted to go out tonight, no one wanted to go out though, oh well, what a shame, yet again i do nothing. Jason has gone away today, probably best, i spoke to him briefly online last night but he was pissed off about lots of things including Laura apparatly being the top of the iceberg, they argue quite a bit, especially as it will only be 4 weeks tomorrow that they have been together, we never had that, i mean we had that blip but as he said in one of his conversations with Ami, nothing was ever bad apart from that blip...  We had fun, we had a laugh, and i feel ok now, as i know we're back on to getting along ok, i have the satisfaction of knowing him and Laura won't last lont, but that doesn't stop me pitying her but at the same time i want to spend time with her, i think its to find out about him...  I am still lonely, its been nearly 10 months, 10 months since we were together, its a long but short time, nearly a year... A year nearly passed since i properly held him close. That sucks, it really does, we were so god damn close, and had everything on our bloody side, apart from her, you bitch!!!!!! I think i want to go shopping tomorrow, spend some money if its not too hot, after all i have 133 in the bank, not so bad this time is it? I better fuck off, at least this year i'm not going to miss Jason,  i pined so much and it sucked so bad last year. Sad thing is, if we ever (not like we will) but if we ever did have the chance, i couldn't miss him like i used to straight away, hes hurt me too bad, hes cut me up, literally.  ~Lisa~

      I am so fucking angry with him, sooooooooooooooooo fucking angry, i wish i could tell her, wish i could fuck things up for him, or at least let her know to be careful, she doesn't deserve to be treated that badly, to be made to feel special when she isn't, when shes just another person to him, i can't believe its the same girl that i used to know in Whyteleafe. Fucking hell, i just wish things were normal, we'd never broken up, i'd never said yes, he'd never asked, be so much fucking simpler its un real.   ~Lisa~

      He actually can't, how can he? How can he? He has cheated on her twice, been with her 3 weeks and only known the girl since last September and he loves her? No, no no. Maybe seeing it will help me? Maybe i truly do need to see someone, talk to someone. She doesn't know, and i can't tell her, she thinks its genuine, she thinks he does, just like i did, she needs to be told. I can't let her get hurt, not like i got hurt, not like i got made to feel loved and special, whats going to stop him getting engaged to her? Oh fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk This doesn't do any good, why do i ask questions i don't want the answers to? And she still knows how i feel, basically because i can't just listen to how they both feel about each other.  ~Lisa~

      I'm still confused and i feel a bit empty really, theres nothing i can do as hes with Laura, and not willing to tell her the truth, and he basically blackmailed me into if i say anything to her, he said in his mind we won't have known each other, not that he can do that. He wanted us to get engaged, theres not something more significant than that to me right now. I do feel bad about everything now, both me and for her.  ~Lisa~

      I'm confused, and down in the dumps, do you blame me? The one thing i want i can't have and it treats me like shit, so why do i continue to want it? Because i know there is a good side to it, but one thing that is irritating me is he will not listen to me. The engagement, was something to me totally unexpected, a total suprise, but something i had to stop and think about, and i did a lot of thinking about it. I had to say no because i didn't want to end up breaking off an engagement as well as a relationship going down the pan. That is something i really didn't want to have. Basically i decided that i couldn't do it, it was my decision, and at 16 nearly, a pretty big one to have to face. Hes so off with me, he can't talk to me, hes guilty about what happened, but at the end of the day he wanted it or he wouldn't have done it. He can't keep pretending, and i still think he isn't telling the truth, and he can't keep avoiding me, its her he should be feeling shit towards not me. It was his idea for christs sake, both times, i just happened to say yes, which was stupid. With a name like love - the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket, he must be either trying to make a point or pissed off too.  He can't talk about the engagement, and i needed to, but we weren't allowed as he didn't want to, did he not think it was going to affect me too? Didn't think i cared about it? Its one of the most important moments of my life, all because it was the wrong time and we both know it meant that it had to end, we had to end. I also think he still has issues with us as well, he so blatantly hasn't moved on properly or he wouldn't have changed the topic to us, i was talking about now, him and her, who i now feel very sorry for. She doesn't deserve to be cheated on twice and she when she finds out as i'm sure she will eventually she is going to hate me but i do still think its best she knows. I guess nothing can be changed now, and with time me and Jason will hopefully go back to talking properly, i wish Tom was here i always talk to him and he always helps me out, i'll have to see him when he gets back, i just wish someone would have listened to me about how i felt, wish he would have listened, its still something that swims round my mind, what if, what would have happened, would i be happy? what now?   ~Lisa~

      I am just one big mess, i was hardly concentrating on my job today, i just couldn't, i was too busy wondering if i was going to see him? And after 3 weeks and she thinks things are just great, i wish i could tell her as i feel sorry for her now. I do feel bad now, not about what happened, but about how she seems to be getting too caught on to him and shes going to get hurt. Its so hard when people talk about it, i can't comment can i? He needs to be told to do it, tell her. I might have to say something to him, get him to do it. I need to wait to calm down, its not the right time and none of mine...  I feel so rough at the moment, this is not doing me any good for my cough and run downness.  ~Lisa~

      I slept with Jason again, was supposed to be spending yesterday evening and night at Jasons, screwing him silly, but he chickened out, lead to me telling Mum everything, lead to me emailing him an ok email, took me a lot to write it and then send it, he had my picture out? Was that on purpose or what? But he didn't seem to notice it... Why the fuck have your ex girlfriends picture out? Why text her twice whilst seeing your new girlfriend wanting sex? Why not go to your girlfriend? Or someone random, not your ex!!! Makes me wonder what he feels or if he is hiding something, he didn't seem happy, or content, why when today they have been together 3 weeks and he has already cheated! GRRRRRRRRR Makes me angry as now i feel confused about him, makes me want him but makes me not trust him, and i can't concentrate and i have it on my mind constantly. Fucking tosspot, well i emailed him..  "but that's because i think your a wicked person, and unfortunately not everyone can see it, which is a shame because&nbsp;people miss out on seeing whata funky person you are, and also&nbsp;then people could understand why i still think your worth it."  Just an extract of it... Sure i'll be posting more often now, Mum thinks i need to cut him out completly, but i just don't feel i can do it...  ~Lisa~

      Carlos did it, and i thought i liked him, and now i think Dave is doing it? I mean, we didn't sleep together but, we did stuff and now he doesn't seem as interested in me? Its just fucking typical, and everyone loves Laura, blah blah, shes so great blah blah. Annoys me, and he ignored me? Twice? What is with that? Then i get a wave? I don't give a shit if he actually cares about her or not, he cheated on her one day in to the relationship with me, and he wanted to, end of, he doesn't care, he can't, hes a cheater and will always be a cheater. I'll never cheat on Lisa, those ways of mine are over, *cough* BOLLOCKS!*cough*   ~Lisa~

      Well... Not sure what to write, i just felt like writing, i realise that my scars are actually quite visable, especially the more rounded one, it shows up when i'm cold too, a deep purple. I've found that recently, well in the past year i get angry and i'm really angry, not like a little bubbling of anger, like a rage of anger, and i can't hit anyone or lash out at anything as there is no one there, its probably a good thing i'm single as i might lash out at someone... Maybe its just hormones or frustration or something, i don't know, but i get angry and i'll just do it and then i've a mark, and another scar, and it can be over stupid silly things. I mean, yes a couple have been over Jason, i mean i was constantly scratching at my wrist just after we split up, i was continually irritated and i did it without even knowing. Compared to about 99% my life is perfect, so i have no real reason to do that, although i've been very good, hardly anyone knows, and i doubt the people who do believe me, but hey, i know i'm not as bad as i was, and its not for attention, to me its like a reminder now, not to go back there, and feel that shitty. I don't seem to have much planned for the weeks except work mainly, but i guess i get lots of money out of it at the end of August, just after results, i really wish that i had them now, i need to know, i can see me getting so agitated about them. I wish i was going on holiday too, be great, even just down to the coast in a caravan, wish me and some mates could go away, or one mate. Would have been something i wanted to do with Jason this year, just go away for a week in a caravan, by the sea, eat cheap etc, he could have driven and just stay on site all the time so not to spend too much money, that to me is a perfect image, obviously he doesn't want it so that is a bit screwy but hey. I'm a bit tired and have a full day of work tomorrow being as everyone else is on holiday. Jason is going away for his 18th to Camber with people, and Laura... Hmm, i dislike her, but i need to talk to the enemy to find out how the target is doing so to speak...  ~Lisa~

      I saw Laura and Jason for the first time together last night and didn't like it, so much so i walked off, but oh well, not sure. Tom still thinks that he still likes me a bit but i don't know, especially with what Tim was saying about wouldn't it be funny if i came back to Jason now, and Jason just went quiet... I can't tell anyone else about what happened as too many people know, i felt so bad when Tom was talking about cheating etc, and i had to tell him to explain myself...  Got work tomorrow, and i never knew Carlos could drive? Well he can... and Ashleigh is lovely, Marc has picked a good one there. Not much else to write about, yet again need to be paid as its Mum's birthday on Tuesday and i won't have any money...  ~Lisa~

      Thats random, just suddenly came into my head, i figured i should get these feelings off my chest, better out than in... But i feel a bit empty today, i guess if things are meant to be with Jason then they will happen, doesn't mean i want someone else to come along, because i'm just not in the mood for them to be honest. I don't know why i bother attempting to talk to Laura, she just patronises me, thinking shes always right, and shes so smug that she has the something i want, i know she is.  She just thinks shes better than me, shes not. Been talking to Ami about going swimming and joining a gym, give me some independance too i think...  Been thinking a lot about A Levels and results and Uni etc, its all looming up so fast and i just don't know what to do or even think right now. Just want to relax and i can do that soon, holidays in two days... &nbsp; ~Lisa~

      Its official, whats wrong with me? There must be something, i don't go around making it fucking obvious that i still feel for my ex, yet i still attract complete arseholes, and my ex shows pictures of me and him to someone that i am interested in? Why do that? Why?  So what if Laura has big boobs, shes not pretty, she talks about sex because she is a slag, and shes been around, theres nothing great about that, so she might be clever, arghhhhhhh she annoys the fuck out of the stupid slut, such a hussy, she has what i want, she stole it, took it away, and i got no good reason, i wasn't even going to be told that he had cheated, oh fucking no? How can she trust him knowing he cheated on me with her? But she really can't trust him, i slept with him girl, and he could have come to see you that Monday night 2 weeks ago but instead he came to me... You not good enough? Aww dear... Hes going to Malta, three guess's what hes going to get up to love, do you blame him? This is casual for him, you can tell, i bet he still flirts with people, still chats up people, and i bet you anything he tries to sleep with people, god it sucks beyond belief... Yes, i am sour, yes i am bitter, and yea i do love him, stupid questions to ask me thinks, doesn't mean i don't think hes a prat.  &nbsp; ~Lisa~

Laura permitting? Like fuck they are still going to be together, nearly two weeks for christs sake, there was a bloody time that he was thinking like that about us? Living together? Sharing everything? And now? Now he wants that with her? Surely there is no way they are going to last longer than us, no way, not at all. I won't be able to stand that, it helps to know hes taken, but i want to find myself someone. I also feel like a stalker commenting on him all the time... &nbsp; ~Lisa~  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Never really get to talk to Jason much these days as hes always with her, maybe he really does care about her? A lot? Maybe he is going to be in love with her? Maybe its best that we don't talk, might help me, but it doesn't help my mind when i think of them, having fun, her, she to me is the most pathetic, feeble person i have ever seen, i mean thats selfish considering she is ill practically all the time but grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, i just need to tell her what shes with, a cheater, and she is one too. She thinks so highly of herself it makes me wana spew everywhere, cheap tart with her whorish ways indeed. I want him for me, but hes never ever ever going to look at me again, i'm not good enough for him.   ~Lisa~

      As well as having a cold, and being run down and stressed i have the most intense tooth ache ever where another fucking shitty widom is coming out, it is really not my fucking week, Jason says he doesn't regret what happened but he doesn't think it should happen again. I hate her, that bitch stole the one thing that i wanted, the one thing that made me happy and i thought life was living for and she had to get her stupid claws in, i hate her for it, hate her with a passion, that i didn't think i could hate with, she is now sleeping with and spending time with that person as she is now with that person, you big fat stupid little tart, you don't deserve Marc and you certainly don't deserve Jason in my eyes you little slag, he needs someone to be nice and supportive, and your a pathetic little cheap tart who needs to learn her lesson, i so want to tell you that he cheated on you, i so want to do it, but i can't bring myself to lose what friendship i do have with Jason. He means that much to me slut, means that much to me that i want him to be happy, just Jason, don't throw away the book, don't throw away our pictures and don't tell her you love her like you did me, we were good and special, and you know it. Please, i wish i had the guts to tell you.   ~Lisa~

      ... I can't helpt it, i'm lost, i'm completely submerged by the feelings that come with it, i can't help the way i feel and i can't help being this way, feeling that, doing what i do, it hurts, it pains me to think of it, i take on selfish, cruel ways, i forget, i forgive, i get hurt, i hurt, thats what happens.  But, he is my everything, he was my everything and 75% of the time it still feels like that, still feels like i am completely covered in this warm feeling, getting close to him isn't sex its making love, and it feels so damn right, feels like we both want it, we look each other in the eye as he slides into me and it just feels so damn right, that could be the randyness taking over but hey, he makes me work, he makes me tick, he makes me breath, without him i die, i fall, i feel even more shit that i do with this god damn chest infection, knowing he is in his room, with her, that hell bitch, most probably sleeping with her, doing things he did to me with her,  it can never be as special as us, can never be as right, or feel so perfect, he knows it, i know he does, we share that something, that makes us work, makes us click, makes us fit, and he knows it, we had always wanted each other, always liked, disliked, loved, its there, and i refuse to forget as the moment i do, will be the moment he realises.  I can't even pretend to forget, maybe i need to talk to someone who knows what they are talking about? I need to get it all out, leave him behind me, but i can't, i keep clinging on...  Falling Tripping Spinning   ~Lisa~

TWAT, you serious dick, your not going to last, he wants sex, you want sex, and you have that desperate fucking look when you look at people, its a hang dog look, let alone dog, i could hang you for it, good job i'm not going to see you for a long time, and if i do, i'll laugh to myself  as i fucked your bf, your bf, yes him, that wonderful person, he cheated on you, and he enjoyed it...   ~Lisa~

      I keep thinking about Laura and Jason and i get well angry and i feel sick at the thought of them, thinking of them sleeping together, just repulses me, i didn't get that with Kirstie or with Lianne, but now i know they are doing it a lot, arghhhhh, just gets to me so much its un real. Its none of my business to care what he does but i do, and i can't help it, and it makes it worse that she thinks shes so damn nice and good etc, when shes a bigger cheat than he ever will be, hes lovely and i swear its only sex he wants, and that he wants to say hes in a relationship and no wonder shes bloody tired when all they do is sleep together, go out or something, in fact no don't, rot in hell bitch i should have just hated you for stealing him off me, and kissing him, you stupid tart, you knew me and him were an item yet you didn't need any persuading, cunt.  She makes me so god damn angry, i see her and she thinks she pretty, and special when you cheated on the best person you could have ever got Laura, MARC! And he still cares, in fact i'm pretty sure he still loves you, and another thing bitch, i slept with your boyfriend, ha? How does that feel to know he was with me Monday night, giving me the best sex ever, feel so special now? No, lets hope not, because your not, you think your good at sex too, but from what i hear you use your teeth more than your supposed to be, didn't you know teeth arn't required when giving head? Obviously not... Dumbass, so he can't care about you, he still slept with me and i bet it don't take much for him to do it again, after all me and him clicked and you know it, you'll never compete in his eyes, so what if we ain't together now, we worked, we loved each other and i'm pretty sure things had been different and we would have been engaged, yea, he ain't going to do that to you love, you ain't worth it.   ~Lisa~

      ... Was actually not the best it could have been, i wish we had been alone, would have been interesting to see how he reacted to me alone... He don't seem to care about Laura, or if he does, he just doesn't want us to see, as he was flirting with Tasha all night, and he wasn't exactly not nice to me, hope he doesn't regret anything, i sure as fuck don't!

And i don't know why? It was good and i hope he doesn't regret it, of course i still like the dude and i know hes taken, but yea, and Eliot and me have made up, i still don't want to hear anything from that guy about Jason, just everyone be normal and nice.

      Guess there isn't really too much to update on, i stayed at Dave's Sat night, which was cool, we had some fun, i'm a bit confused at what i feel for the dude, not sure if i have genuine feelings or if i just fancy him, but i don't really know him, don't want to hurt him especially if he has feelings for me, but from what Jason tells me and the way Dave acts i get confuggled? Erm, back to college again for some UCAS days which are helpful but i'm yet again still confuggled on what i want to do and where i want to take my life, i mean yea Uni would be a great experience and i'd gain a degree and be well proud of myself, but i don't know what i want to do so therefore don't know what degree i want? I want to work as well purely for money reasons and the fact i am greedy and want money to a, spend and b, see piling up in my account. Mates wise everything is cool, i dislike 6th form with a passion but can't do much about that now, could move but is there much point? Plus it would put me closer to Jason and Laura's ever growing sexual encounters and i don't think i could stand seeing them two all day together, would do me in so much, and Tom would be there, don't get me wrong hes a great mate but sometimes i just feel he smothers me too much...  I am desperately looking forward to the holidays, chance to relax, work and see my mates with no hassle of times or dates or coursework etc.  I keep thinking about Jason and Laura, especially when i know that they sleep together, i guess they are a couple now, but for some reason my brain isn't picking up on that bit? Even now when i write it down it doesn't seem to register that he could very well say i love you to her very soon? If i hear that or get told, then i don't know, not thats its my place to have an opinion but i won't like it very much... I try to stay neutral but my feelings just get caught up in it all and then i feel yucky again, and the cycle continues.  ~Lisa~

We still are close, i still care about him i just need to move on and maybe in the future we'll work again, i believe we could, but i also believe that i need some time to be me again, realise what i am and who i am.   ~Lisa~

      Thats what i feel like, basically. Can tell i'm on, everyone is irritating the fuck out of me, and i don't know why? Might not be going to the cinema now as Jo has the gym? All day? I have swimming for an hour in the evening, and she has the gym all day? I don't think so... Go to a BBQ next Thursday in the park, but can't take loads of people from Reigate etc as Ami doesn't want it ruining things for others. I feel stressed out again, Jason not being here worked wonders, maybe it will be good when he goes off to Uni somewhere, i know i won't be able to see him, talk to him etc and maybe it will help, so only another year like this, woohoo! I hardly have much money either and i don't know where its gone, my boss is annoying me and i need to work out how to ask for a pay rise or i'm going else where. Laura just annoys me because she has Jason, and they seem so happy, she wouldn't be so happy if she knew what i knew, not even that keeps me happy these days, i used to love knowing that i knew and she didn't but i can't tell her or anyone that i know will tell her or i'll lose Jason and he said that on purpose as he knew that i wouldn't say, but she told Eliot yet he still loves her? But thats because he didn't care about our relationship anymore because it was past it in his eyes and it would never be the same. I wish i could get him back, but for some reason hes caught on her which annoys the fuck out of me, he would hate it if i went to Gray... He would fucking hate me and try and kill Gray, so how the fuck does he expect me to be? Its been nearly 10 months and i still wish i was with him because i can't find anyone else i click with like that, and hes looking so damn good at the moment and i just hate her, shes not lucky shes a bitch and shes just using Jason as she couldn't get Marc, and if only he saw it. Let me have another chance, what did i do wrong to not deserve to try again? Just remember what we had and how much fun it was and how much i cared and you did too. You loved me Jason, as much as you thought you could ever love and you had wanted me for a long time, and we clicked. Now you have someone who you know cheats on boyfriends and who you know was with Marc... Come on, just try me, i'll never hurt you, i never lied to you, i always wanted you to be happy.  ~Lisa~

      HATE HER SO GOD DAMN FUCKING MUCH SHE MAKES ME SO FUCKING ANGRY AND FULL OF JEALOUS ANGRY FRUSTRATED FUCKING STUPID FEELINGS, WHY THE FUCK HAS SHE GOT WHAT I WANT? I LOOK AT HER AND SEE HELL, I SEE WHAT I WANT AND WHAT I CAN'T HAVE AND I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, I'M SO PISSED OFF AND ANNOYED AND DOWN, AND NO ONE GIVES A SHIT BECAUSE I CAN'T SHOW ANYONE, ITS ALL FUCKING HIDDEN BECAUSE ITS PATHETIC.... IT IS SO GOD DAMN STUPID, I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT, I NEED TO GET FIT, I NEED TO GET PRETTIER, I NEED TO TONE UP, I NEED TO BE DIFFERENT, I NEED TO BE HER, I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM ME AND ESCAPE, ITS SHIT BEING ME, IT SUCKS BEING AVERAGE, I WANT TO FEEL SPECIAL TO YOU KNOW? AND THAT FUCKING PRIVELAGE WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE HER FUCKING SIZE DD BOOBS OUT AND HIM BEING A DICKHEAD OF A BLOKE LIKING THEM, WISH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN, MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER TALKING TO HIM AND HER, AND KNOWING, KNOWING THAT I SLEPT WITH HIM, AND JUST WANTING TO TELL HER, WELL GUESS WHAT PRINCESS? I SCREWED HIM GOOD AND HARD AND IF I HAD MY TIME AGAIN I'D DO IT AGAIN AND I'D MARK HIM JUST SO YOU SEE WHAT I DID... JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT HE WANTED ME, IF ONLY FOR A GOD DAMN FUCK, HE STILL WANTED ME AND I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON HIM. HE CAN'T DO HAPPY LAURA, HE CAN'T DO SECURE AND HE CAN'T DO LONG TERM, IT DOESN'T WORK FOR JASON, NOT UNTIL HES COMFORTABLE AND HE THINKS I FORGOT? FORGET WHAT? EVERYTHING WE BLOODY WENT THROUGH, I COULD NEVER DO THAT BECAUSE I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, I CARED ABOUT HIM AND COULD NEVER FORGET ANYTHING ABOUT HIM BECAUSE ITS ALL SO S[PECIAL TO ME THAT I WOULD NEVER NOT WANT THOSES MEMORIES  Anger over and i feel on edge and not real, its all so fucked up in my head and mind and i can't unscrew it so to speak. On a more positive note i can type and not look at what i'm doing and actually manage to spell what i want to which is alright, finally my touch typing skills are working ok! Not the point of this post, maybe i do need to go see someone? Maybe what i need to do is talk to someone completely neutral, i doubt any of my mates actually tell me the honest truth about what they think  because they all think i am completely pathetic and need to move on. I do need to move on, but it doesn't work like that in my mind because he meant so much to me, so so so much that i cannot put it into words. Going now, need to talk to Tom he always knows what to say to me.  ~Lisa~

      I like talking to Ashleigh, she makes me feel better about it all! Plus i don't have to go back to the orthodentist now as he says my teeth look fine! Which is cool! Pleased about that, supposed to be going to the cinema with Jo on friday and i'm working today and Thursday and Saturday, so more money at the end of the month which is nice. Not much else to talk about on the feelings and crap front, still there, just wish it would go away.  ~Lisa~

      Spoke to Danielle a lot about Jason and stuff today, which was nice, miss him like mad, and i saw Laura today and made me angry and they are together now, i just can't see whats so good about her? But i wouldn't would i? Wish i could tell her or get rid of her, hes worth so much more to be second best, thats the way it seems, Marc is lovely, but Jason was and i guess kind of is my world and i think Laura's heart lays with Marc still. Working 21 hours this week, means more overtime at the end of the Month but i just seem to waste it on stupid things. Results on the 19th having a hissy fit over them, and i keep using Danielle's words which isn't good! Lol, and i need to go on a god damn diet thingy, everyone is so skinny, Laura, Danielle, and i need to stop eating.  ~Lisa~

      To hurt, so hurt me some more... I love that line, don't know where i picked it up from, anyway just had a lovely conversation with Jason, about lots of stuff etc, and i had to ask about Laura... He took her out last night for dinner and shes going with him today to the rehersal... I hate hearing about it, so i shouldn't ask... Hurts to hear him, i still don't believe that he feels strongly enough for her as he still cheated with me... I can gain a lil bit of feeling back from knowing that and knowing she is oblivious to it...  ~Lisa~

      Hes back, and i really want to see him, just to get a glimpse of him, but i'm back to feeling bitter as he'll be with Laura 24/7 or working, and i bet he played around when he was in Malta, i bet he did... No stopping him, i should really just forget about him... Going out tonight so maybe i'll pull if i go into the sheep afterwards... Working lots next week and thats about it, probably sunbathing too, be nice, i missed him even though hes not with me, but i guess i always miss him.... A tiny part of me does anyway. Anyway i better go now as i got to have a shower and i'm hot ans sweaty from work which is nice.  ~Lisa~

      Well its hot and warm and lovely and sunny and it makes me feel better! Stayed at Ami's last night, was fun, saw some very hot bloke at skaterham, which was nice, eyed him up for a good half an hour, yummy! Just chatted loads, i fell asleep thinking about Jason though, and just chilled today and been in the sunshine which has been nice, determind to get my belly button pierced and got Gemma's hen night tomorrow which should be a giggle, got a new black lacy top for it which i love! I been trying to block Jason etc etc all out of my mind, but its still lurking a bit...  ~Lisa~

      I've just seen some pictures of Jason taken by Laura, and i am overwhelmed by jealousy, he looks so good at the moment, really really good, and i know i'm lucky i even got a bit of him, but my i am so jealous of her. I need him and i want him and i want to get him. I need to have him. Why does he have to have her? Shes so desperate and clingy and so blatanly still cares deep down for Marc and Jason you are second best, she has run to you because she couldn't get what she wanted... Can you not see it? I can, maybe thats because i'm trying to be negative, but you shouldn't be second best to anyone, your the best, and i have a fear shes just with you because she doesn't want to seem alone and unloved, so she'll have you because she knows you'll tell her you love her because you feel insecure and need to be loved too. I wish i didn't care, i really wish i did. I really wish you would care about me too. I just wish i was good enough, wish that all the shit that had happened hadn't and we could try again, never say never, but its been nearly 10 months, 10 months on the 16th of this month, it sucks so much. I wonder if he ever thinks of us? Or me or anything like that? I mean he must think of me a bit for him to do what he did with me, i just wish so hard that things would change. For the better, for me. Hopefully we'll be mates again when he comes back as we were kind of talking before he left, mind you he was pissed off with Laura and down about stuff, but they sorted it out, and he won't come in to the shop to see me as he feels guilty, bastard shouldn't have done it then should he? But i can't take away this overwhemling feeling of jealousness that is crawling all over me.  ~Lisa~

      ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I can't stand the thought of him telling her he loves her, some uncontrollable feeling comes out of me, and i hate it, she cannot love what i love,  and he cannot love her, its not possible, its not love, not love until you want it all and lose it all, and still care.  ~Lisa~

      I'm running out of titles for my blogs... I've posted that many times. Anyway, went shopping today with Jo and had a good day, so everything is back to normal there which is good. Saw Carlos too, and hes looking well so glad hes ok. I really think i'm giving up on Dave, he doesn't seem keen on me at all, maybe i'm being silly, but he doesn't seem in the slighlt bit interested and i'm not going to waste my time and energy thinking maybe he likes me when he doesn't. Well i brought two bras and thong sets, a perfume, a shirt, and a c.d today, did pretty well, in the sales and used my student card. Apparantly my mobile has a software malfunction with picture messaging? That sucks if it has...  Jason still away, spoke a bit to Jo about him, but not too much, don't want to push my luck with her really. Sure he's having a wicked time, him and Laura only been together nearly a month, sounds like a small amount of time but that month has killed me, plus compared to us its nothing... So guess its back to me being single with no one interested... Fun, so much shit has happened this month, mainly with Jason, and i almost dropped myself in it with Jo today when she nearly read the messages, just need to try and put it behind me, he has so i should too.  ~Lisa~

      ... apparantly because my left breast is bigger it means i'm guided by my emotions and not logic...? Ok... Rings some truth, as in i am very emotional person, i do cry, i cry a lot, i'm allowed, i get angry, more so now than i have ever known and i get frustrated, there all emotions right? Anyway, if i was always guided by logic then i'd hate it. Jasons away, and guess it means i can't think of him, as hes not here for me to think of, trying to block what happened out of my mind, as i'm sure he is... Mistake is the word, as in i got fucked up over it, not good, again. Plus he has Laura, he should be happy with that... I know they have had arguements, more than she had with Marc, but Marc is a very laid back person who doesn't tend to voice his opinions until later... Just think if he had asked her to try again that night in the cartoon, Jason would be single, and we could maybe meet up for mroe regular times... Fun! Right, if i delve deep into my mind, i like Dave, i know i like him, but i can't figure him out as i hardly see him and hardly talk to him which in some ways is cool, its casual and i don't wait for him to text etc, it just happens, i love that aspect, but i find myself thinking about him sometimes, and i wonder why? Especially about when we were sitting in the long grass and he had his arms round me tightly, that was nice. Comforting. It was a hard night for me, seeing Laura and Jason together, and him talking about the past, and me feeling so god damn mixed up. You see i don't bother talking to anyone about things like this now, as theres no point... Everyone including myself is sick of hearing what i think of him, and what he doesn't think of me, although when we are together Tasha says there is chemistry, but maybe thats simply because we spend so much time together..? I do miss him, but i don't feel hes the same romantic sweety he was to me, to Laura, or with anyone. I re-read what he wrote in the valentines card and that piece of paper with me drawn on it, that was sweet and i will always keep that. It means the world to me, that piece of paper with his writing all over it, talking about me, how much he loved me, describing me... It was perfect. I'm so glad no one knows about this, i feel like i can actually open up, i would never put my diary on a website i knew people would read, its not a diary, its publicly telling people who and what you are.  ~Lisa~
