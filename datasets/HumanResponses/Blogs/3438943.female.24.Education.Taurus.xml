      Do you guys have a settings tab?  Under that is an email tab where you can add in your email and have the posts sent to you.  Not sure if it sends when comments are posted, though I think under settings tab under comments you can alteast choose to be emailed when someone comments on your post.

      This list is intended to clearly explain what items are and are not affected by various traps in War of Ages. Not everything is precisely covered, but there should be enough here to yield a general idea. Obviously, a use of Trap Dodge extends to equipment carried/worn.   Noisemaker, Stinkbomb, Paint, Massive Mechanical, Weapon, Gas, or other Alchemical traps do not affect items, with the exception of Oil of Slipperiness or Paste of Stickiness. The Marshal will deal with those events on a case-by-case basis, and the items will generally survive.   All tagged items AND money are vulnerable to, and destroyed by Explosive traps. The only exceptions are Artifacts (With Plot approval), and Mech items that are Installed or Linked to the Mechanon at the time.   Acid and Flame traps are a bit different:   Flame and Acid traps destroy everything that Explosives do, EXCEPT metal weapons, armor, and items stored entirely within metal containers that were themselves closed when the trap went off. Armor, while not subject to the Destroy effect, still takes the numerical damage from the trap. Wooden weapons ARE vulnerable! Because gems are used for currency in War of Ages, Flame traps also leave money intact.   The following weapons are generally at least part wood and thus count as wooden, unless otherwise specified ON THE TAG: Axes, clubs, arrows, bows, hammers, pole arms, staves, and spears.   War of Ages also adds Concussion and Lightning to the possible Trap effects.   Lightning traps destroy all tagged items, EXCEPT money, alchemical potions/gases, and wooden armor or weapons. However, metal boxes do not protect items within, open or not! Wooden containers WILL protect items inside, unless the trap is also therein.   Concussion traps only destroy Alchemical substances, Potions, Glass Tipped Arrows, and Rockets. Everyone within the area of effect of a Concussion trap when it detonates WILL be knocked down. (The marshal may allow you to three-count the fall and/or the act of standing up depending on field or personal condition.)   All trap effects are automatically avoided by items that are Rendered Indestructible or entirely within a closed container that was Rendered. Likewise, a solid physical wall, closed door, Wall of Force, or Ward between an item (or person) and a trap will stop the effect.

      Does this send out emails everytime a new post goes out?  Thats the major function of the yahoogroups that made it worthwild even tho it's really lame and full of advertisements.  If it wont send out emails just by posting, maybe we can just send out a group email with the new posts.  The features are deffinetly awsome here tho.  -Bryan

      Welcome Aboard, hopefully the other will follow suit.    Headed to AC Moore today to get plant life for Mire Witch.  1/2 the felt things for the army are cut and ready to glue. Looks like we'll have 24 total. Looking for philosopher stones too.  Hoping my cool witch hands make it in time for the event.  Anybody need stuff at AC Moore?

      Well things are coming along.  I'm feeling mostly better- less coughing, less stuffyness less soar throat.  Costuming- supplies bought- shirt maid- the hands for the mire witch have made there way to conneticut and still say they'll be delivered tomorrow.  Felt project 11 glued, rest are cut- phil is finishing up with the cutting and gluing for the remaining 13.  Laundry got done too.  Don't know whats up with my girls(cats loki and ari) they seem attention starved- sleeping on my at night and meowing at me to pet them and play with them.  Today's plans- finish work got some work work to do and some reading to keep my busy- quite day here.  Walk on my lunch?!?!?  Unless I come up with something more pressing that needs my attention.  Maybe hit the gym on the way home- whether I walk or not been missing workouts due to sickness.  Weighed into day 2 down since starting tracking- not bad considering I'm at my heaviest time of the month.  I'll be real active with Nero this weekend so I'll weigh in again next week for more accuracy.  Better eat- well more contorolled portions (i've been over eating alot lately) and getting to the gym more often are important.  Next week out of the office m-w at a conference in boston.  Which means I need to leave out long weekend event early and come home and sleep so I can get there on monday.  Back to further plans- gym on the way home?!?!  Girls night.  Damn forgot to mention it to Jackie or leave a note.  Ah well I'll have Deb head over and we'll wait a bit for Jackie- think she's coming home since she mentioned it in the first place.  Day off tomorrow yah summer schedule.  Must get sticker for my car.  Pick up witch hands and other stuff piling up at my parents.  Sleep in.  Shop at costco, get to site in the afternoon.  Hummm maybe i should get a sticker at lunch and walk a few time through the day.

      Last night entailed- finishing the History of the World Part I, Mel Brooks and Beauty and the Beast, plus some relic hunter.  Trying to catch up on my dvds before the new wave hits.

Prep the other 1/2 tonight and get Phil to work on some gluing.  Things to do: Laundry AC Moore run- glue?  costuming for the mire witch Read The Taking- which I didn't get to at all yesterday :(

      I hate head colds.  This one has acutally been moving around- chest,  throat and head- currently residing in the left side of my head.  My only saving grace is that I can breath through the right side of my head.  Throat gunky- though not soar like it has been the past few days.  Living on tea today, tea and strawberry halls.  Yah for vapor action.  Also considering going home on lunch- i have vapor rub cream there and Loki didn't get brushed this morning.  Since I'm going to Phil's tonight and csi may come- though doubtful I think I'll run home.

      Just purchased Dean Koontz's new book- The Taking.  Since first finding his web site I have known about this book and have been waiting atleast six monthes.  Also picked up a second dvd play so i can have one in the bedroom and one in the living room where my tread mill is.  Today is going much better than yesterday- even feeling better too.  More commentary re: the taking to follow shortly.  Probably won't get anything else done till the book is finished.

      Once a preschool teacher I have come so far from the enjoyment I once found in children.  As of late my favorite thing to do it watch a kid throw a tantrum in the store.  Sitting near kids in a restaurant- out of the question.  Babysitting that used to be a great way to make some extra cash- not so much.  Don't get me wrong I'm not to the point where I hate kids- still think I'll want at least one later in my life.  Maybe I'm just in a selfish phase right now but kids are money and work and time.  I much prefer the cats I have now.  I can decide not to go home- even for a couple of days they are fine as long as they got food, water and a fresh box.   They give back to you too and they don't require all that much.  Maybe its because people rely on my so much for stuff that I enjoy having a relationship that requires very little from me.  Hopefully I'm not destined to be an old cat lady- but I think I understand them a bit better.  I guess I also crave a stimulating enviornment- don't get me wrong kids can come up with amazing things most adults would never even think of.  Guess I'm just enjoying the adult world and at this point I'd be okay with not having kids of my own.  I think my way of thinking is better than the type who want a kid but doesn't realize the commitment and such that it takes.  Final not having a kid is not a way to strengthen a marriage- don't do it.

      Watched out Changing Lanes last night with Samuel L Jackson and Ben Afflick.  Very interesting movie.  Love how things connect back and forth and form a story.  Also watched Edward Scissorhands later on.  Thinking of the six degrees of seperation in my dvd collection.  Think the last Samuel L Jackson movie I remember seeing was Unbreakable, maybe its because I watch it all the time.  Actors I'm enjoying: Samuel L Jackson Denzel Washington Johnny Deep  I just seem to love the movies there in.  Of course I'm also a fan of  M. Night Shyamalan  Jerry Bruckheimer  Tim Burton J. Straczynski

      I've been reading Blogs of some of my favorite actors and writers and such.  I've found them interesting.  I've also connected with them because I often feel I have the same types of things running through my head with no direct audience to comment to.  Since I love technology and routinely plugged in I though a blog of my own would be a great way to put all such stuff together and have it all in one place.
