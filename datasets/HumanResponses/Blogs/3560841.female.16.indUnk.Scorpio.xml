						   You know, so far my summer pretty much sucks. My friends have been in and out of town, and I think I've seen 'em once on our own time, since school let out, maybe twice. I'm still tryin' to find a job, but no one's interested in a 16 year old around here, I'm hoping that I'll have better luck towards when school starts up, seeing as how I need the job to graduate. *sigh* homeschooling was a bad idea, who would have thought it'd cause this much trouble. Dink was lucky, all she had to do was take a couple tests and vuala she was excepted into 9th grade. Me? Nope, sorry Hun we don't except any homeschool other then the Texas one you'll just have to repeat ninth grade, grrr, my life sucks. Okay so it doesn't suck all that bad, I mean I have a great family and awesome friends, but you know, I'm just whining. *sigh* my sis is planning on getting married at 16, how awful is that? I mean she's not giving herself much time to enjoy being a teenager. But I guess I can't blame her, she thinks she's head over heels for this guy in California. I'm actually praying that it wont work out, that somewhere before she makes a colossal mistake they'll split up or something. but maybe I'm just jealous? But then I've kinda stepped away from the whole dating thing, as much as I complain, I know I'm not ready for a relationship. Okay well that's enough random thoughts hey?                             ~Addie

						   OK so my friend helen stayed the night last night, and we went and saw Garfield. My and Dink argued a bit today, not much just a disagreement over child care and went to the gym. I'm reading Jane Eyre, it's a really great book that just wont end. That's if for tonight.                               Addie

						   Alright, so we got back from camp today and no one was home...yeah that kinda sucked. So me and dink sat infront of our door for like 15 min. then suddenly i think, hey you know we can get a key from the front office. So dink goes at gets one, and Mom and Big bro get home right after we unlock the door.  My real dad stopped by today, i keep forgetting he lives so close now. I like screamed DADDY when i opened the door and saw him, and of course he smelled like ciggarrett smoke. But hey, i haven't seen him since.....like last summer so i was thrilled to see him, as much as his actions annoy me he's still my dad. Anways, okay so camp was GREAT, i got sick on Friday though and missed out on the water olympics thing, but over all being a YCL was really fun. Sis. Hill our Ward Camp Leader was just awesome, really really cool adult with a halrious 2 yr. old. okay it's late and i'm 20 min. late for bed, and i've got church tomorrow.

						    Just got back from the store. Dink and I have YW camp tomorrow. Dink isn't thrilled, and i hold my tongue. Camp can be fun, can be boring, but it's supposed to rain until Thursday, so maybe it WILL be fun, who knows?   I'm kind of in the middle of making dinner, spaghetti, and the noodles are in the process of cooking.   Anyway, my real dad quit his job AGAIN, i lost count of the number of jobs my dad has quit, and that's only the jobs that i was aware of the world for. So yet again my Mom's plans on getting us out of debt have been set out. She too nice, honestly, I would have garnished my dad's wages a long time ago, Mom's still "working" with him, which really means letting it all slide and letting our financial statis slide with it.  Dad(step dad) hasn't gotten paid, or rather he's gotten paid but he can't cash the checks(something like $3500) until thrusday or something.   Anyways, went swimming today, also practiced out skit for camp, I think it's pretty cool...if you know you go for the silly stuff, which i do. Anywho, that's it for today         Always,                Addie

						   Alright so just started the blog thing, not to sure what i'm going to use it for. Maybe this'll be that thing wherei just yell at everyone so i don't actually hurt feelings,hey? Let's see...random thoughts..my brother(22) and my sister(14) are playing Little Bunny Fu Fu...purrrrfect sunday activity no? anyway, they get a little weird sometimes, especally when Dink gets bored. Hey now that's an idea, for future reference, Dink= 14 yr old sister Big bro=22 yr. old brother, DJ=21 yr. old bro, Airhead= 19 yr. old brother, Baby= baby sister, Mom...is kinda obvious, Dad= step dad, Real Dad= biological father (i'll probably rage about him quite a bit) uuum okay and that's if or now.
