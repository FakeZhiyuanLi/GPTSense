      Standing on the edge of my demise, With a tear falling from my eye, I turn around as I hear my name call, With my hands out reached, I fall,  The feel of the wind passing through, As I hear a frail cry from you, Reaching out for me as you wallow, Speaking of how you wish to follow,  Praying to God for one last time, To take the tears from my eyes, With your arms out waiting for me, As then you wake up from your dream.

      Listen to my heart as it beats for you, A song of my only love so true, Keeping up the gentle rhythm, As it breaks its lonely prison,  My heart as is beats strong for you, Gentle and warm, and all just for you, Love has made my own love song, For you my heart will beat long,  Just feeling you close to my side, Stops the tears that made me cry, My heart is yours, only for you, As it beats so strong, only for you.

      Here I am all alone, Walking along a forsaken road, Forgotten way as is my heart, My world is torn apart,  Who would come to save me now? Will an angel desend from the clouds? No! as I am all alone just forsaken, My will my heart has been taken,  Black clouds over my head,  A cold chill as all is dead, Why am I left to slowly die? Rain falling as I ask why,  Will I ever get out of here? Will this blackened day ever clear? A slight hope as I walk on past, Broken as it falls with a crash,  The darkened road of no hope, My life at the end of a rope, Sorrow Pain, and all despair, Is what is only in the air,  Will an angel save me? no! Will I ever escape? no! Can I find within to get through? No! as I am stuck lost inside truth.

      I sit and wait for you my dear, Never has my heart seen so clear, This longing feeling as I wait, For you to fill this empty space,  As the time goes on by, With only you on my mind, To then be able to feel your embrace, As you fill the forlorn empty space,  When we are so close together, I can think of nothing better, All my life I did wait, For your love to fill the empty space, That was once in my heart.

      Here I am, and there I was, In my days, missing you so much, For wherever I go, whatever I do, Everything reminds me of you,  As in the morning, when I open my eyes, Looking out far, to the tranquil sunrise, It is beautiful, just as you, Once again I think, of our love so true,  Going on, in the mid days time, I just can't get you out of my mind, Looking around, at all so peaceful, Closing my eyes, seeing you so beautiful,  There I was, Here I am, Waiting to be hand to hand, All in my days, whatever I do, I can only think, of how much I miss you.

      Silence overcomes the fleeting,  Sound of my heart beating,  Pain overwhelms the being,  Of my love ever feeling,  &nbsp;  Regret beacons to be called,  Making me lose it all,&nbsp; And with the crashing of the walls, All my hopes will fall, &nbsp;  Coldness creeps up more,  Stealing my loving warm,  What hope is there in store?  Helpless as I am scorn,  &nbsp;  Darkness falling from the clouds,  Lost in the empty crowd,  As I blindly scream aloud,  I am finally found.
