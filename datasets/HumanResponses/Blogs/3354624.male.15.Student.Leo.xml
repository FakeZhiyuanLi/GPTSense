      Today, not at all happened. Well thats a lie. Where to start,  Victoria lied to me twice!?!?!? Ya. Not once, but twice. She said she would put a poster for her campaigne on my locker door. Guess what.. She didn't. Then, she said she would give me candy. What did she do? Not give my candy.:'(.  Then I got kicked out of french class because I'm stupid. It's not fair. She expects us to remember everything she thinks we were taught :@:@:@. Well thats about it. lol.  Right now, I'm talking with people on msn. To be more specific, I'm talking with Jackie, Tasha, and thats all. I'm gonna phone someone. Yes jackie. I'm gonna phone her. lol  Well I'm gonna go.  Later!

      Why does life seem so boring? Well I haven't written in awhile seeing the is nothing to write about. I'll tell yah about my weekend. Friday I went to Stef's house. P.S stef. That chicken at your house was REALLY good! Ok,then I went to the dance at my school. It was pretty interesting. Mainly just because of all the people that were drunk. And poor Sam. I hope you don't get into too much sh!t! Then after the dance, Stef's dad called Cameron a pervert! lol. He touched her bum! lol. Now on to Saturday. Saturday was pretty interesting. I went camping. With a group called beavers. They are pretty interesting kids. Funny and stupid, but still interesting. lol. So that was that whole day and over-night to Sunday morning. Sunday was ok I guess. I woke up, aching. I was hurting all over. The beavers went home, and I was talking with the leader (which is my dads friend) and I found out that I was getting hours for going. I added all my hours up and found out, that I am done my 40 hours!:D:D:D. So that's my weekend. Now I'm at home, doing nothing at all. Well I'm gonna go now.  Later!
