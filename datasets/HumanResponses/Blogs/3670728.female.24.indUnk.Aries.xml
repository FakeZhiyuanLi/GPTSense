      well, i have to say the more i talk to sean the more i realize how much i care for him...his thoughts...his daily life...he is such a great person...and everyday i have mixed feelings about him...like one day i want to tell him everything i am feeling and than the next day i am unsure and convinced that he doesn't care about me as much as i do for him...  so, i have decided that if i get to go see him next weekend i am going to say those three words i am feeling...i want him to know and if he doesn't say it back than oh well....life is short and i want him to know

      so, i have this online journal that i write in and express my deepest thoughts...and when i read them over they don't seem that deep...they are just impressioins of what is really inside...  i can't even figure out what i feel for sean...he is everything i have ever wanted in a guy but i am scared to death that if i completely let him in if i tell him that i love him he will take my heart and crush it into a million pieces...  i am one who has always been strong no matter what...i take my tears and i swallow them all the time; picking myself up and facing the world again...but i don't know if i can do it again...and i am scared that these fears are going to destroy what could happen with him...i need to let go; i want to let go...i want to let him in...but i am so scare; this could be it if i let it and opportunity only comes so often and this is it with him, my last opportunity...and i guess that all that matters is that i put everything i have out there and just go for it; holding nothing back...b/c in my heart that is the only way to really truely love someone; and if i get hurt than i get hurt and i will be ok as i always am

      so, about six years ago i played cinderella in the musical cinderella...well today at work this older man came in and asked me if i was ever in the show cinderella.  and i was like "yes...why????"   and he asked me if i knew this guy named "Tim L" and i was like "oh yeah he played the prince"  well, he said that this tim guy told this old guy that he could never forget our kiss.  and that i broke his heart....i couldn't believe it!! that was six years ago and this guy remembered me and knew my name and remember our stage kiss. weird eh????

      so, last night when sean and i talked he said that he liked how i had my own "things"...that i was a very nice person but also very very driven and wouldn't let anyone walk all over me....which is true...  i am very quick to take care of myself...i have been doing it for about six years now...i am just use to it...i guess i just never felt that i really had anyone looking out for me...my exes all cared about me but i think they just would sit back and let me take care of them and didn't put forth any effort to do things for me...of course i am not saying i expect all this stuff b/c i have no need for stuff...i just want thoughtfulness.  you know, like sean gave me a japanese charm for my car for safe driving...that meant so much to me...it was so kind and it really surprised me...i am just not use to it...he really is a sweet guy but more than that...he is such a kind compassionate person and i am falling in love with him b/c of it....  i am looking forward to seeing him this weekend and just talking to him face to face....(sigh)

      so, sean might be coming to good old dayton ohio this weekend and i can't wait to see him...  my little nieces were over last night and i couldn't sleep b/c everytime i heard them move i would wake up....  talk to my friend Rita last night she's doing well..i miss her  why is it that when you're single no one notices you but when you are taken everyone starts asking you out?????

      so sean talked to his ex last night.  and he kind of mentioned me but didn't really.  i realize that he will always have a special place for her that i might not ever really understand.  and i would never try to stand in the way of them having a friendship; i just hope he realizes that i will do everything i can to make him happy. and i will give him everything that i have in my heart.  no matter what happens.  i just want him to be happy.  and if things do change between us...i can handle it.  i have taken care of myself for a really long time and i am not scare of being alone.    so, whatever happens i can always relay on myself :)

      sometimes i wonder what you were thinking the day you hurt me were you hurting? did you need something? did you realize that you were going to destroy me?  in that moment  i completely trusted you  unaware you stole from me a part of me that i can never replace a part of me that was suppose to be special  and in that moment  i smiled at you

      I saw a sign the other day outside of a yard sale that said "huge sale" .  I thought it would be funny to erase the "e" so it would say "hug sale"

      Jewel Lyrics  Absence Of Fear Lyrics    Inside my skin there is this space It twists and turns It bleeds and aches Inside my heart there's an empty room It's waiting for lightning It's waiting for you And I am wanting And I am needing you here Inside the absence of fear Muscle and sinew Velvet and stone This vessel is haunted It creaks and moans My bones call to you In their separate skin I make myself translucent To let you in, for I am wanting  And I am needing of you here Inside the absence of fear there is this hunger This restlessness inside of me and it knows that you're no stranger you're my gravity My hands will adore you through all darkness aim They will lay you out in moonlight And reinvent your name For I am wanting you And I am needing you here I need you near Inside the absence of fear

      I stayed on the phone last night until about 2:30 am and i had to get up for work at 6:00am.  I was so tried i couldn't get my contacts in, so i had to wear my glasses.  people at work told me that i looked like a teacher...i said thank you i guess....  I was on the phone with Sean.   He makes me laugh so much and he truely has the biggest heart in the world.  He is one of those people who wants everyone to be happy.  He is so compassionate.  He has a kind heart.  I think he is starting to care about me just as much as i do for him so that is good.   I tried calling my friends in NY yesterday but was unable to get in contact with them.  I miss NY so much sometimes.  It has so much energy and life in it.  Sometimes when i close my eyes i can still see my street; but it is starting to fade.  I don't think that i will ever live there again.  I am thankful for the opportunity to live there.  But i don't see myself trying to live there on my own.  Since i left the city two of my friends have been robbed.  So, i think living in Ohio would be better.  Plus, I would be closer to my family and to my boy.    well, off to work at my wonderful job :)

      I made a wish on a star last night..the last time i did that it i was like fourteen years old or something...so it makes sence to try again now that i am 24.  I wished that sean and i would someday get married...crazy huh??  i just think he is an amazing guy and i am falling in love with him.  i am...so i made a wish on a star...and i hope it comes true.  i just hope that he is feeling the same things i am...i have not said those three words to him just quite yet...but i want too and i say them to him after i hang the phone up every night...  JEZZZ!!!  I am sounding like such a girl!!!  i haven't been this silly about a guy in a long long time....:)  it is great though b/c i am happy

      so, i am falling really hard for my bf...he's so nice to me and he is funny!!!  oh boy, when we spoke on the phone last night, i almost said those three words but i stopped myself.  i don't want to say them to soon, but at the same time i don't want to ignore my feelings...i am not use to being guarded...but it is necessary right now i guess  it is necessary b/c i have had my heart broken at least two other times and i have never tried being guarded...i always let my feelings fly out of my mouth...without much thought...b/c i have always believed in following my heart instead of my mind...like dropping out of school to go chase my New York City dreams with only $500 dollars to my name...i am just like that i guess...i had a different bf at the time of my NYC days and i thought i was done...i thought this is it...but he wasn't it b/c he didn't want to make things work...he didn't believe in fighting for things...and what is really strange is i didn't stop him from leaving...or giving up...but i would drop everything for this new guy in my life...if he asked me too...i would give things up to make things work between us and i have never felt that way about anyone...and i think that is why i want to be guarded b/c i WANT this to work...i want to be with him...:)  i am so happy and so scare and so silly and so (sigh) :)

      ok so i think i have a bf now.  a guy that i have liked for a long long time..  I think he is wonderful.  smart, funny, handsome, and he wants to be with me?   i don't get it at all.  and i keep doubting it b/c i am insane..i think i am...we are taking things slower than i am use too.  and i am having a tough time holding my feelings back...so i am "acting" all cool and calm..but i just want to tell him how i feel exactly....but can't for fear of scaring the crap out of him and having him run away...boys....

      so, i got a lot of things done yesterday.... paid some bills; and filled out some loan stuff for school exercised....  i am going to a baseball game tonight with some friends  last night was productive for the most part until i got upset with sean for no apparent reason....  we normally talk every night on the phone...which is wonderful and sometimes we don't get too b/c i am tired or he is out with friends which normally is fine with me...but for some reason last night him not calling me hurt me so much....i feel awful.....i was mean to him...and he didn't deserve it...so i have decided that i am idoit....i texted him and told him i was sorry for acting like a bitch and he said that it was ok and that he loved me but i still feel like crap about it....sigh  however, if that is our only problem than things aren't too bad??? right????  &nbsp;

      I am a member of the elite coffee club at work.&nbsp; The coffee club consists of different people from all areas of the company.&nbsp; It unifies us under one&nbsp;common love; COFFEE.&nbsp; It has become a peace maker.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is five dollars a month to be part of the club.&nbsp; The five dollars&nbsp;is used to buy the supplies for the club for example creamer and the coffee itself.&nbsp; Being a&nbsp;member has proven to be extremely important to my survival.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coffee is the only thing that gets me through ;mondays and pretty much the rest of the week.&nbsp; However, I have increased my coffee intact since becoming a member.&nbsp; I have noticed I need more and more coffee.&nbsp; So much so that I have a strong desire to "get rid" of other members so I can have more.&nbsp; I have also noticed that the other members of the club are starting to exibit&nbsp;strange behaviors.&nbsp; For example, the other day there was enough coffee for one more cup, and I was next in line to get it.&nbsp; I could&nbsp;taste the wonderful stale flavor.&nbsp; As I prepared to grab the coffee pot, "Jodie", a co-worker, "accidently" knocked me down.&nbsp; I watched from the ground as she got the last cup of coffee and walked away laughing a queer hauting giggle that still echos in my darkest of dreams.&nbsp;

      can one find strength in another? or strength found within?&nbsp; i have been asking myself that question a lot lately.&nbsp; i have always been shut down i think...to others taking care of me.... i think i expect myself to never need anyone b/c once you need someone you become weak...sean said something to me that made me think...he said i am always looking for ways to escape....and it is true...i think in some situtions i still see myself as a little girl...scared and navie....and my escape is through shutting down..closing my heart to others...being tough....but with sean i don't mind if he takes care of me...i wouldn't care if he held me when i was scared or sad....i need him but it doesn't make me feel weak....strange eh????? maybe the answer is that strength comes from within but can only be seen through another's love...or maybe it is just that strength is a cup a coffee in the morning....:) &nbsp;

      okay so last night i talked with sean and i went on and on about new york...and how i miss it, you know...every detail...like the way the bulidings cut into the blue sky...and how when you first wake up if you are really quiet you can hear birds singing outside your window...and how every person who walks by you looks like they are doing the most important thing in the world... i miss the church around the corner from me where i cried about missing my family...where i lit my candles to pray for all of my friends....i miss the way the subway sounded when it stopped...and how you could never understand the driver of the subway...how when you were on the subway it was really cool to stand instead of sit...i miss how in strawberry fields random people play beatle songs really badly...i miss it all...i really do...
