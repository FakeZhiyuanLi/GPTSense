      I feel like a fraud sometimes but I am really just confused I never defined myself, never thought I would have to I thought being me would be enough  I am not sure who that is anymore.  I live in a world of labels If I hide my contents I may be mistake for an empty jar My jar is far from empty  There is still room for perfection and a few more mistakes Do you know where I could find a label to fit me? What would you write on me with your black permanent marker if you could?  I am not quite full, I am not quite  I have the faith of a sinner and the prayers of a beggar begging for what they do not know they want and things they do not need.  I hope God loves me.  Is hope enough?  Am I kind enough?  Good enough?  Even though I want to love you in ways not depicted in the bible.  If actions speak volumes, I scream a whole lot of nothing.

      Love poetry is interesting to write.  Someone once said that all the love songs have been written, and in away they sorta have.  However, as long as there are lovers and poets there will be love songs and I am not an exception:  You (June 30, 2004)  You are so damn beautiful I wish I was beautiful and had something to offer you  other than this trembling body and a well worn heart  I was warned about you Told you had a charm that could lure a goddess and every girl to your arm  Well, I am just a girl like the other girls who follow you around and dream of taming your soul and making you home  It would be better if you were cocky and you wore your skills on your sleeve but instead you hide behind an awkward demeanor that makes me want to take you in my arms and tell you how wonderful you are  I do not understand if you are a player  why are you not playing me? Why do you look so shy and sigh, than walk away from me? What type of girl could make you home? Could I take you home?  You are so damn special, I hope I am special  and you think of me like I do you.

      I have decided that my poetry can never reach it's full art potential if noone ever reads it, for my creative process is only one step in the process of art.  I need people to interpret it and relate to it to be real.  So, I am going to be posting my art here.  It is a seperate entity from my blog rants, and deserves its own place.    Here is warning however,  My inspiration may come from real or fictional events or people and noone is allowed to worry that a poem is about them.  Even if it is.   I am also open to suggestions to make my poetry better. I will be posting both fresh and old poems.

      (D1 - Sept. 24/03, D2 - June 30, 04)  I crave sweet kisses upon my lips A place to lean my shoulder  Two hands upon my hips  Fingers grazing gently the small of my back that escort me through doorways or try to make me laugh  Hair to run my fingers through the caress of an eyelash A soul to run through rain with and in puddles splash  A warmth to fill my body A tingle down my spine The look of love's sweet reasoning that says, "You are only mine"

      You are so quiet, sweet and comfortable But I am not comfortable With what's rolling in my head And the place that I am Between you And every him that came before
