      When you put boredom and anxiety together it creates a state of being that may be worse than death.  Since I've gotten up this morning I've been pacing back and forth and I know a cigarette can briefly cure my woes... but no I fucking quit smoking.  I am a shining knife today, ready to stab back.

      The other night I took part in these bizarre games where I was driving around my home town...  I was running around up to mischief with three boys...  I was thrown back into this sentimental feeling, back when I regularly was up to mischief ... I remember Kathleen and I and our "grocery antics," my most favorite memory involving eggs and pantyhose...  I remember Erica and I screaming out the window at certain houses and leaving bizarre art projects on certain people's cars... Years ago Kathleen saw the creation of the "Enchanted Fucking Bird” and Erica witnessed the ceremony in which I gave away the "Plasticware Heart,"  and Sebastian and I welcomed "Kwafasa Zimbuki the Yard Bushman" into our lives...  Running around the other night made me miss the art of chaos, the art of mischief... I touched it again, briefly clinging to a carefree sensation that somehow reminded of summer days that passed me by in South Glastonbury...  my daily run around Matson Hill and my daily stop in the berry fields to visit Sebastian and Grub, with the sun beating down on me, the zen in the buzz of the bugs, the beads of sweat running down my back, the relief in jumping into the pools of cold water at Cotton Hollow, the relief in the endless summer days, the humid air on my skin and the contentment in listening to the thunder rumble in the distance,  like the clouds in the sky my life carries on. It reminded me of this poem I wrote when I was 18.  This is parts of it, it’s like five or six pages long. heh heh.  I loved writing the long nasty ones when I was 18.  So I’ve cut it up and these are just my favorite lines from it in an unreadable sort of way.  SOUNDS AND SMELLS I'LL DRIVE TO Summer, summer. Sweet sexy summer Letting the word roll off my tongue makes me want my tank tops and makes me want to walk to  Dustin’s house.... Summer summer satisfying summer. I went swimming down at Cotton Hollow. Every single friend I had  went swimming with me down at Cotton Hollow... During the summer I’m sure there were thunderstorms- crashbangboom and hailand tornadoes. If I could only remember them, but then I was busy with cars and frisbees, rock and roll, drugs dizziness forgetfulness, smiles sleepingdreaming, handstands... Rockandroll, crashbangboom, I made love to the summer in all my helplessness  under a fireworks-lit sky. Bitten by mosquitoes, listening to birds mocking my voice at dawn in my front lawn... In summer we became dancing tribes- passionate children,  we watched the sunset and magic rise out from our fingertips. The heavy summer air satisfied me: dreams and comets and lightning and running, movement and boiled noise. Follow my laughter into the summer: I’ll go swimming even through a billion thunderstorms. I won’t even have to wear  scarves and boots. I’ll just take a nap, a ride, a sigh I’ll listen to and smell everything I make love to.   So, I guess it was a nice run around.   Chaos stays in the blood, even if it is idle for a long time.

      Jon has convinced me to quit smoking today.&nbsp;  So I am.  He said he'd ollie off the staircase behind Daybreak if I quit, &nbsp;and that sounds pretty amazing.&nbsp;   Now, I am thinking about my beautiful cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shared my&nbsp;longest relationship with cigarettes...  &nbsp;I started smoking them when I was 16 and they've been there for me ever since:  they've been there for me at various concerts, they've started a many conversations with folks I've never talked to before, they've been my comfort in sour times, they've been part of my daily breakfast (along with a cup of coffee),&nbsp;they've kept me company in cafes across Europe, they've been my perfect prop when I played Bohemian writer - sitting in the corner of a smokey cafe listening to deary jazz music as I write over dim candle light with a carafe of red wine....   I'll miss smoking.  It's really quite an art.

       The mix tape.  A beautiful thing.   I was asked to create a mix tape of music that would be brand new and liked. So, this is the final result, with explanations for each track.   Side A.&nbsp;   Bruce Springsteen   "Tenth Avenue Freezeout"    For some reason, the Boss is an easy target of insults&nbsp;slung by ignorant indie brats that think they are "too cool" for the Boss.&nbsp; The truth being, the Boss is too cool for them.&nbsp; If you've yet to experience  The Ghost of Tom Joad , it is time to go to Borders, or wherever you buy your music, and purchase this magnificant album right away.&nbsp; Now, "Tenth Avenue Freezeout" is a standout track from  Born to Run , another essential Boss CD.&nbsp; This song is constantly stuck in my head, mainly the part when Bruce sings about being all alone.&nbsp;

      Early in the morning, I come here, looking for you again, and when I hear the music of you play it leaves me feeling dizzy, I see you standing outside the door covered in cowboy magic, a convincing smile, and a child's face, you say something subtle, you look at the sky, like you are waiting for it to fall on us. and you always have something new everytime - just enough to keep me coming back.

      A palmist told me that I shouldn't bother looking for love.  She assured me life was taking me down a different pathway, and that I should try doing yoga instead.  The palmist assumed that yoga was a simple replacement for love.  So, go along not calling me back and ignoring me and I'll just stick myself in the child pose or the sun salutation for the rest of this life.  Cheers, my eyes are all fucking open and I feel enlightened.  Lonely and enlightened.

      L'amour est un spectacle, il amuse. L'amour est une drame, et je peux t'assurer : ta charme se fane plus vite que ta passion. Je te visite rarement de nos jours, et quand je visite , c'est la compagnie de ta chat que je préfère.  Merci bien, quel bon effort!

      Jesse, Clampet and I recorded twenty minutes of avant garde sounds over bizzaro spoken word, thanks to yours trully.  If you haven't heard it yet, let me know you are interested.  Here is part of what I rambled on about: "You are on another plain of existence now, when you resurface from the caves two men in masks will greet you and they will take you to where you need to go..." The twenty minute piece has become infamous in our circle of friends, we've hyped it up, and when you join the circle of those that have been enlightened by it's powers, you may run very far away.    Basically, if we someday reach this point:  http://www.hugi.is/hahradi/bigboxes.php?box_id=51208&f_id=1075  things will be going fine.

      I'll move back to Paris soon enough... just so I can hide in the corner of some smokey cafe in the 13th (Edgar Quinet or Montparnasse) and drink and smoke (yes smoke) quietly while watching life pass me by. Only in Paris do I feel content watching life pass me by. Elsewhere, life feels like a race: I am in a constant race against time against love against myself ...  It feels like a brief pause when I am in Paris: alone roaming Jardin du Luxembourg, alone exploring the labrinth of the Quartier Latin alone climbing the steps to Sacre Coeur where I may look out on a city that is physical poetry that is love in the form of buildings in the form of culture. I'd ask you if you'd like to see pictures of me in Paris, but surely they'd bore you. Afterall you are in some sort of unexplainable rush to nowhere inparticular.

      I am on the radio on Tuesday nights, and some Tuesday nights I'll have no visitors in the studio with me... no one will call me... no one will send me messages... I'll just be sitting here playing music I like and rambling and stuttering on the mic.  It feels like I am doing a show and tell for no one.   And that seems to be the metaphor for life, here and there that feeling of staging a big foolish comedy for the eyes and ears of nobody.  Either way, when you hear these songs I probably picked them out on purpose.

          "We want to drown our aloneness in relationship... That's why we become so much involved in love. Try to see the point. Ordinarily you think you have fallen in love with a woman or with a man because she is beautiful , he is beautiful. That is not the truth. The truth is just the opposite: you have fallen in love because you cannot be alone. You were going to fall. You were going to avoid yourself somehow or other. And there are people who don't fall in love with women or men - then they fall in love with money. They start moving into money or into a power trip, they become politicians. That too is avoiding your aloneness. If you watch man, if you watch yourself deeply, you will be surprised - all your activities can be reduced to one single source. The source is that you are afraid of your aloneness. Everything else is just an excuse. The real cause is that you find yourself very alone." -  Osho .   Sometimes a week will go by, and nothing happens the way I want it to. That was my week last week: it was not joyous, nor fulfilling, nor beautiful. It was anxious and bizzare and very lonely. The events of the week soured and by Friday I felt fearful about what I would be up against for the weekend... It approached me slowly but surely like a giant hurricane... I waited for it to hit full force and destroy everything in my path. It was an odd feeling, like I couldn't wait until Monday. Is this strange? I had these terrible feelings that I could feel building up inside of me, boiling inside of me and this anxiety fell out of me in the form of beads of sweat on my nightly runs.  I have taken to a new addiction: running. I run everyday now. I run a lot, maybe too much for someone that just quit smoking, that hasn't been active for years... but I love to run. I run until I am red and sweaty, until I can't possibly run anymore, I run longer and harder each day. So, I was trying to figure out what it was that made me so obsessed with running and I realized it was the most amazing way for me to get out all of my aggression. For everything that makes me upset I just let it all out when I run... all the anxiety, all the stress, all the misery. Sometimes I just keep running because I tell myself it is for certain reasons. I'll think something like, "this mile is for the time he pissed me off," or "I'll sprint this hill just so you can't pidgeonhole me as some nerdy lazy scenester." It's like I am becoming a fuller person from pushing my body to the limits, it's some sort of weird relief, some sort of weird meditation.  So, I'll be running along, somewhere in the hilly roads of South Glastonbury, and the sky will be darkening and heat lightning lights up the sky... and I'll be feeling some sort of Zen, detoxing my body of anxiety and depression. I can think about the universe that unfolds in front of me over the horizon and I can flush out all the terrible emotions of the week and think about how everything happens for a reason instead. I'll be running along, and I'll picture life as this path, where everything happens for a reason. I've always believed everything happens for a reason, we are destined to make certain mistakes and to learn certain lessons. We are destined to meet certain people because they may give us love, or take love from us... we all learn something from it and run along to the next big event, the next set of fireworks in our lives...  I guess I'll just run and run like some sort of twisted dumb Forrest Gump and no more bad karma will ever be able to catch up me ever again.
