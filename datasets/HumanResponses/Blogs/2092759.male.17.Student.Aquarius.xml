      Its only 5 but I'm fucking tired.... I cant focus on anything but this screen and the 311 playing on my Media Player, ( urlLink 311 Audio Downloads )I'm horrendously bored and tired. I have a headache that would birth Athena. (Bonus Points for anyone who can tell me what the hell that means)     I read something interesting today and I've been thinking about it for about an hour now: If a tree falls and rises again in the forest, but no one was there to see it, did it really ever die? The nature of things is odd. Human beings define themselves by time. Without time there is no context to judge historical action, so without time there would be no culture before us. The present is an endless storm of errands and pointless activities that only serve to detract from the greater meaning of what we are doing on earth. The future has exponential potential and as such can never truly be defined or studied in such a way as to predict a viable outcome. These "truths" are all taken from the human perspective. A tree has no concept of time. Ergo, whither the tree ages, grows, expands, and eventually dies is irrelevant because the tree will eventually re-grow and begin again in exactly the same situation as its "predecessor" until, the ancestor and youth became one and the same. This creates an effect refererd to in  Escape from the Planet of The Apes  as Infinite perspective. Lets use an example: A painter paints a landscape. And yet something is missing to him, so he draws a second portrait, one of himself painting the first portrait. But, there is still something that he feels is wrong, so he paints a third portrait, one of himself drawing the painting of drawing the painting. This carries on until we have a portrait of the painter drawing a picture of the painter drawing a picture of the painter drawing a picture of the painter drawing a picture, etc, etc Until the perspectives meld and the observer becomes the observed and time is infinitely perceivable.    And on a much lighter note two things to leave you with: I Get to go see Phantom Of the Opera tomorrow! Hells yes! and   Mr. Giant Taco Inventor   Bud lite presents: Real men of Genius ( Real men of genius ) Today we salute you, Mr. Giant Taco Salad Inventor ( Mr. Giant Taco Salad Inventor ) A culinary creation that baffles the human mind, A 12,000 calorie salad ( Aie Carumba! ) Ground Beef, Refried Beans, Guacamole,  Cheese, Sour Cream, and, if there's any room left a few shreds of lettuce ( I don't see no lettuce! ) Some may ask "Is you taco salad healthy?" Of coarse it is. Its a salad, isn't it? ( You can eat that deep fried crunchy bowl! ) So crack open a nice, cold Bud Lite Conquistador of the Calorie, you put the "feast" in fiesta  ( Mr. Giant Taco Salad Inventor ) Bud light Beer, Anheuser-Busch, Saint Louise Missouri

      We won Sweepstakes in our band competition yesterday! (Ok, granted we were one of only two bands in our division. And we didnt march becouse of the fires. And we the comp was part of a judges circuit that generaly scores higher then others. But none of  that matters a damn bit. We won sweepstakes!) I think we need to keep working. I dont want us to get lazy now becouse we won an insignificant, and a tab bit imbalanced comp. Witten gave us Monday off, and i think that was a mistake. We need to keep working and keep morale and drive up. I want to win sweeps again at Savannah in two weeks, when it actually matters. I want to be able to stand our ground at the Impulse Invitational. Well, Halloween is closeing in, and I am doing jack shit for it. If any of my friends read this and want to do something then im down, but as of yet I think I might just watch somemovies or something. Probley just watch  The Nightmare Before Christmas   a bunch of times.   Matrix Revolutions is coming out in just Nine days, Fifteen Hours and Ten minutes. Anyone who wants to come with me, ill be getting my ticket on Thursday after school. Give me enough money to cover the price of a ticket and ill pick you up one. I have scout meeting Tuesday next week, but as soon as it ends (roughly nine o clock) i'll be waiting in line.   Untill then, to all the people in the world who have nothing better to do in their life then hate: Take. The. Bullet.

      Well, our competition yesterday kicked ass. We were a single point shy of getting third place, and that was only because of a one point penalty we received due to our castle backdrop staying on the field too long. Despite the penalty and a fifth place finish we still beat Villa Park! The bus ride home was interesting to say the least (Sorry Ryan, were assholes, but you gotta love us.) and Fridays was fun. I didn't get home till 2 in the morning, and it was sure as hell worth it. I went driving with my mother today, possibly one of the single most annoying and disgusting things in the world, and discovered that as of yet I wasn't going to Phantom. She said that she hadn't known that I wanted to go so she just paid for my brother and father. I'm kind of pissed off about it, but she said that she'll pay for the ticket if Mike can get them.  I took the PSATs on Saturday. It was eerily easier then I thought it would be. I'm a bit scared because I may be overconfident and I might have boomed it big time. *Shrug* In the end its just another thing to appease the endless machine that is our neo-imperialist, faux-compassionate capitalist society. Lol , and my parents too.   There and Back again   I have a need to leave my home, and see the mines of god. Experience both the switch and rod. If golden realm has drawn me off much farther than I've been then ill turn around  there and come back again.

      Its 11 o clock at night and i just got back from an away game with the band. Im tired as all fuck right now, but im staying up for quite sometime so I can finish all of the homework I have in AP History. There is no way in heaven, hell or whatever the fuck is in between that I am going to finish the homework and understand it enough to do well on the test. The field show (Carmena Burana) was decent tonight. Tone was a lot better, but the tempo still rips in places. We should be decent by the comp next week, at least enough to show significant improvment. I have a date for Homecoming! I went to the game tonight, and Sara and Suchit (Two bando seniors from last year) were there. I started talking to Sara about how Smeagol had a date, and I still didnt. She told me she wanted to go, and now were going. Im preety happy becouse i get to go as opposed to sitting at home on my nerdy ass while my little shit of a brother goes to a dance (with a girl no less!). Ok, i had better go and actually start working on the friggn Histroy assighnment or im going to fail horribly.  Bye Everybody! (Bye, Dr.Nick!)

      I saw the trailer for The Matrix:Revolutions finally today. That is the pimp shit, and I cannot fathom waiting another three weeks to see that move. Agent Smith is amazing, and Keanu Reaves has actually found a movie where he doesn't suck horribly. Damn space time continuum..... I got royally reamed on my last test in AP History. In had an 83% in the class before the test. I now have a 78%. I have got to pull that grade up. There's no way in hell I'm getting a C in that class.  Sometimes I wonder what Life is about. Is life the love of another or a love for the world? Life is a walk in the woods, enjoying the creations of the world, and its natural beauty. Its a rolling mist that passes over a redwood forest in the early morning, one that obscures the man made confusion that causes the sight of what is, always has been, and always will be. Perhaps life is  poem written by a love one in the heat of the moment that reveals a peek into the writer's soul. Life is a kiss. A single moment that exists within a split second of time that stretches on into the infinitum that is memory. In the end the beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   Fate of a Blossom   Some flowers open to soak up  light. Some stay closed till late into the midnight. Love is a odd and fickle thing. One moment open, blazing like spring. The next recoiled and shuning the  warmth it once desired. Passion without love is an Oxygen deprived fire. Lotus blossoms forgotten in a loss of inhibitions trampled and destroyed in lustful transgressions. Only to be  raised from ash but never resurrected.

         I dont know if anyone knows how much of a pain in the ass being a Senior Patrol Leader of a Boy Scout Troop is, but if anyone shares my pain I am unimaginably sorry for you. Its fun, but at the same time, dealing with thirty middle schoolers ( and a bunch of freshmen and sophomores that need to stop acting like middle schoolers) is not exactly the best job in the world. Im just glad this will help with college, getting a job later in life and it has helped teaching me leadership skills. Now im just a contemptuous asshole as opposed to a contemptuous ashole, who needs to be right all of the time, and be in control, of everything around him.    Mike, our Drum coach has set up a field trip for the Drumline (and its affiliates, Woot for being a low level helper!) to go see the Phantom of The Opera on November 5th. Fifty bucks a pop, and its almost entirely the original broadway cast, so its an amazing opportunity. I love this show, and I hope my parents let me go.     Quick interlude for those who are nerdily inclined:I am currently prepareing for the Extended Season of the Magic The Gathering Pro Tour. Ive been playing the game for around six years and id like to qualify this year. I have developed a deck from an Old Type I deck known as Stax. Its a Tinker Variant that uses red for Goblin Welder to generate an obscene amounto mana and Stroke the opponent to death. If any part of the last paragraph makes a bit of sense, or youd like it to i need all the help i can get testing the format out. It requires a good deal of research and testing so its not to be taken up by people with an overtly full scheduale. End of Nerd Interlude. Ok, heres a random Tolkeinesque poem I wrote.   To The Mountain   The trail is long, the sky is bright and we have long to go. All we need is two fortnight and a lack of snow. My friends have come and gone left me on the trail alone. All I need is starlight and I can bear the storm.

         Why did god make High School the most depressing time in your life yet the one filled with the most joy? I cant stand it. I see people around me having deep, meaningful relationships. I see friends breaking up with people they love and cherish because they aren't ready for a relationship. I see people get married. My sister just had a friggn kid, and I can only imagine the amount of love and commitment that requires . And I'm the sixteen year old nerd who has still yet too kissed a girl yet.     I don't know, maybe there's a plan, and maybe were all just kidding ourselves. Whither or not the world makes sense or it is a series of random hormonal imbalances and messed up synapses will always be a mystery. If I have some where I can feel I'm going, someplace I can feel in my soul  needs  to go, then why the hell am I so lazy? Sometimes I want to shoot myself because I know I have all this uncontrollable drive and ambition, which could be used for amazing things, but ill never get off my ass and actually  do  anything about it.    On a lighter note, if anyone who is available reads this I am in search of Players to round out my funk band, WTF: White Trash Funk. I currently need another Trumpet player, Two Trombone players, a Bassist that can play slap, a keyboard player, and a Tenor Saxophone. Anyone whose interested just aim me, and well talk about it.  Here is something I wrote at the beginning of the year:   A brave new World   A Small path  leads to a smaller door Within, a cold floor with pews of wood and stone.  The hole filters rays and through the glass they fall rise above the dwey mist  to meet my gaze.  A dead god, with hallow eyes, yet a living world full of love and lies.  Gone are fen and fell from mortal eyes lost to technology  and modern times.  On the path,  a coin lay forgotten. Men pass, Time fades, and thus it is forsaken.

      Damn. I havent posted anything in a month. Im a lazy ass aint I?  I have discovered the funniest cartoon in a long time: Kid Notorious on Comedy Central. The concept is that Robert Evans, a powerful hollywood producer, is a secret agent for the government. So far he's attempted to assasinate Kim Jong Il, exposed an Nazi hiding as an infulential member of the Jewish hollywood community, and many other zany adventures. Anyone that has yet to see it should do so. i fervently support the above product and/or service.  Thanksgiving is tommorrow and that means two things: Shitloads of food and drunken grandparents. My dads family is very straight laced, so seeing them drunk is one of the greatest childhood memories I can think of. Seeing them try and hum with their wine glasses and tell the same dirty jokes ive heard a thousand times before is just something that warms my heart. My Grandma is a phenominal cook. Its ridiculous. The lithargical haze is both long lasting and highly enjoyable.      I need a chick sooooooooooooo................. bad.  But on that note, a friend of mine has been haveing troubles with his girl. I was listening to the songs I had downloaded a few days back and I stumbled upon one that I felt best described the situation.  You Wouldn't Believe Music: N. Hexum; Lyrics: N. Hexum, D. Martinez (I.E. 311)   He was a king 'til she laid waste Now he can not fill up the space And I just see him drifting while he's drifting On bourbon alley feeling low Just because she let him go I don't think he even knows He'll ever be fine  Refrain: And he's got  a head full of ideas Let me tell ya  That you wouldn't believe And he's got  a heart made of pure gold And something else Many tricks up his sleeve You might think he's a jester  because he'll make you laugh til' you cry  And what else You better come with your best  if you test him Unless you're ready to die  Wonder woman got rid of wonder man that man's not part of her wonder plan Letter to the so called better bet on my man Believe it you will find out baby Damn  Refrain  A million people come and go Through a person's ebb and flow And faces keep on changing While they're changing A certain few will stay in tact When they're not they'll don an act I know this important fact Don't get confused like  Refrain  First you love him then your loving him not All the while he just smiles giving all that he's got Do you find it in your heart to say he's not what you sought Do you want me to continue with this or what  Whoa yeah, whoa yeah Head full of ideas Let me tell ya  That you wouldn't believe And he's got  a heart made of pure gold And something else  so many tricks up his sleeve

      Wow. I haven't posted anything here in almost a week. Holy shit, Ive done so much this week. Phantom of The Opera was amazing. I had such a good time it wasnt even funny. The music, the acting, and just the general vibe was phenominal. I'll always be a fan of that show, especially with the original cast. I have mock-trial for the Crucible in my English class tommorrow during second period. Im the lead defnese attorney, so I have to come up with an opening statement before 8:25 tommorrow. I dont know how much ill write or how long ill be up blabbing but it will probley beingt something worth seeing.   Homecoming was last night and I had the best time ive ever had at a high school dance. Sara, if you have/get/read this: Thanks. You made last night awesome and put up with my textbook case of chronic white-man syndrome. Just going and hanging out with you was great, and even though Brandon was being a bit of a punk it was one of the funnest nights ive had in a long time.  I wrote a short story a while ago, something that i'm preety proud of but I havent really given it out to anyone so i think im just going to post it here.                                                      The End of Innocence, The Coming of Fire                                                                       By: ************** 	The young man is sitting in the potato fields, silently dozing, while hiding from his driving brothers task mastering. The smell of freshly tilled earth is all around and he breathes it in. His clean white shirt is covered in dirt and his pair of brown overalls is a little muddy. The trees of his father’s farm provided good shade in the summer, or in this case, during the winter they provided something to climb into and keep warm (warm being anything other than the cold ground). These trees planted in the potato fields farthest reaches are a species of evergreen nicknamed "Bed Leaf" by children and soldiers that would camp out in the trees huge leaves for a dry, warm, if not overly comfortable place to sleep. 	This particular day, this particular boy (who's name happens to be Nickoli Ronsiov) has conveniently "forgotten" his choirs and his assigned toils to go and sleep in the crisp, cold, winter air. His older brother, Vladimir, has been left to do the choirs around the farm. He doesn't complain, but you can be sure that if Nickoli shows up before eight o'clock tonight his brother’s foot will be introduced to his ass. Nickoli knows this. All sixteen-year-old boys know what’s in store for them when they get home from going off without telling anyone where they’re going. Some parents think they enjoy the feeling of a swift kick in the tail. In reality they just weigh the positives and the negatives of disappearing for the day, and miraculously the positives always outweigh the negatives. In short, they just don't give a damn. 	Nickoli looks at the night sky and wonders the things he will see in the years to come. All men in the Galactic Federation must serve a three-year military term at the age of twenty and Vladimir, or Vlad as Nickoli likes to call him, is shipping out in a little over two months. He wants to spend as much time with his brother before he leaves, but considering the fact that Vlad is, in Nickoli's opinion a "lovable, cuddly, hard ass.” he felt today would be the most optimal day to have some "me" time. Today being the last day of harvest and seeing how they had miraculously picked the potato fields the last week, Nickoli seized the opportunity. The young man sat staring at the clouds wondering about a few things. What would war be like, or for that matter love? Would he live through one to see the other? Many things are unsure in the galaxy right now and he is worried. 	None of this matters now though. His worriers melt and meld into the seamless shapes in the clouds. The leaves on the near by oak trees are blown off the ground and drift down to land on Nickoli's face. A cold wind blows down through the field and sends a shiver up Nickoli's back. He gets up and runs down from the raised hill that the tree stands on the in the southwest corner of the field. The wind at his back and the moist earth beneath his feet the young boy gallops over the field towards the swimming hole that is often left unused during the winter for the obvious reasons. As he reaches the dock he begins to shed his shirt and overalls. He steps towards the edge and jumps.  	Just before he would have hit the water a strong arm reaches out from behind him on the dock, grabs him and places him back on the dock. A shrill, whining voice erupted from the thought of Nickoli, "Vlad! Why do you always have to be such a asshole?" 	"Well, little brother, if you did you choirs and didn't leave me to do them for you then I would have to be such a asshole, as you put it. By the way I didn't do them for you this time and seeing how mad Mama and Papa get when you don't do your choirs before dinner, I suggest that you run your scrawny ass off and get home. Dinner is in half an hour." 	"But, I can never finish all my harvesting in a half hour without my arms falling off! That’s three whole fields!" 	" Then you had better run, shouldn't you?' Vladimir said as a sly smile covered his face. "And don't go naked, I’m sure the ladies in the village don't want to see the "little trooper" very much now. Considering the weather it wouldn't be too flattering for you either." 	With that, Nickoli rose to his feet, quickly got dressed, gave his brother a rather impolite gesture and started off running towards the village and the fields. All his brother did to this is smile and yell at the small figure moving off into the distance "Run little one! Run!" Nickoli never heard this but he go the idea. He was screwed. Fucked six ways from Sunday. Damn it, Vlad. I'll never finish this and if I do I’ll be so tired I won't have enough energy left in me to eat supper. As he rounded the corner in to the village square he noticed something odd about the way the people were moving. Some were huddled together, talking in hushed voices. Others were visibly scared shitless. 	"Mrs. Troski, what’s going on?" he asks the old woman in the window of the bakery, the largest store in the square. 	"Nothing, Nickoli, darling. Go Home. Hide and warn your parents to stay inside." the old woman said in a hushed, concerned voice, a voice of concern and worry. Suddenly fear overcame her face. "Run Nickoli. Run!" 	Why she wanted him to run he did not know, but he was so scared he did not question the old women. He took off down the small dirt street toward his farm so fast that he could not even hear the cries of the women yelling at him to run as he passed by the old folks home, or the swear words that came from the market place. It had become colder since he left the swimming hole, so much so that the sky began to snow. The boots he wore crushed into the fresh layer of puff that lined the street. He exited the alley onto the paved streets of the farming communities. This is where the farmers and their families lived and plowed their fields. The community field and the area for livestock were at the other side of the town. The farms are not exactly close to each other but they are close enough that one could run from one to the other in about fifteen to twenty minutes without being winded when he got there. As he rounded the corner of the street he could hear the sounds off gunshot and fighting coming fro the square. Scared for his life, he simply ran faster. Nickoli approached his house and saw his mother standing at the doorway waiting for him. The snow was really coming down now and he could see the concern on his mothers face. "Where are your brother and father? Vlad left about forty-five minutes ago to go find you. When he didn't come back your father left to get the both of you. Where were you today, my little lazy one? I noticed that your fields didn't get harvested today." 	"Sorry mama. I forgot about them. I won't do it again." Nickoli lied. "Father and Vladimir are not back yet? I haven’t seen papa since this morning but Vlad was out in the potato field wit.. Getting me. He should be back soon." 	His mother eyed him with one of those looks that can make you piss your pants. She turned away from him and walked into the house. Nickoli turned around for a moment to see if he could see his brother or father coming up the road. When all he saw was snow and pavement off into the distance he went into the house. The Ronsiov home was not spectacularly large by any means but it was large enough that the four of them could live in peace for the few years that they actually did live together. The house was heated and air conditioned but the generators that powered most of the house and the barn had really bad power converters so they broke all the time, but today the house was nice and toasty compared to the outside condition. 	Nickoli trudged up to his room, which was in the attic. His mother yelled up at him "Nickoli! Wash your hands and face and come down for dinner in about ten minutes, ok honey?" The teen aged young man brushed her off with the typical groan that is a trademark of his age. He hurried up the stairs to the second floor, which contained everyone else’s rooms and the bathrooms. He passed them by and pulled on the small cord dangling down from the ceiling. A door opened from the roof down and a small ladder came down from on top of it. He climbed up the ladder and into his room. 	  His room was a maelstrom of papers, sheets of music, dirty clothes, instruments and (somewhere in the mess) his bed and desk. He is a talented musician, not the best at his school but he tries harder than anyone else. His real passion is writing and politics. He is not a very outgoing young man, but when you have earned his good graces and his friendship he will talk your ear off about politics or his latest poem or story. Recently he has developed a passion for researching the history of the first planet in the confederacy, Earth. He enjoys reading economic theories of the great analyses of the days. Marx and Engels, the political calculations of Fronc, the economic ponderings of Chreza and last but not least the overall works of George Scott King. He loves debating with his friends why these theories of great men and great countries failed. His friends blame it on the easily acceptable viewpoint of the majority:  the socialist and Marxist theory does not work. The existence of free trade is a basic human need.  	For the most part he does not question this assumption made by his friends and peers because he knows that, for the most part he is the only one that has examined the theory. They mistakenly call the soviet countries in the 20th century truly communist in nature. None have read Marx, few have read Chreza and Fronc outside of history class, and there is only one other person that Nickoli knows that has even heard of George Scott King. That particular person is his one true intellectual equal and his main source of debate. Charles Jeos is his rival, friend and collaborator. As Nickoli walks down the stairs to greet his mother properly and eat dinner he thinks of a discussion of little importance that he and Charles had earlier in the week. 	"Momma, there was a commotion in the streets when I was walking home. Mrs. Troski told me to come home and not look back. As I rounded the corner onto our street I heard gunshots coming from the village. Do you know what’s going on?" A look of open curiosity was on the young mans face and a parallel image of dread and discomfort came over his mother. 	"So." she said as she backed up a few steps slowly and fumbled behind her for a chair. Grabing the nearest stool from table she sat down. "So, this is how the government repays us for feeding their damn soldiers!"  Tears began to well up in her eyes as she began to speak faster and louder, almost at a yell. "Bastards! Raze our lands, burn our farms, destroy our lives and kill our families, then just go off and cover it up as if nothing happened." 	"Momma? What is going on!" the distraught Nickoli pleaded with his hysterical mother. 	"The Galactic Federation Army son. They come to our planet every 20 years or so, steal the sturdy men, burn the crops and loot the buildings. The media doesn’t get involved because its controlled by the government, the other planets don’t give a damn because they are to busy staring into their own navels to give second thought to off-world problems. They let the Federation handle it, even when the federation is the damn problem! And on top of all this the supposed upper class, those fat, wine sipping bureaucrats that run the mines and factories encourage the army because after people die they tend to lose their main means of support. That means they can pay you as little as they want." She got up and, with a dazed look at her son; she walked towards the front door. Looking out the front door you could already see the flames rising from the town square. 'Papa didn’t leave to go get you and Vlad. Vlad didn’t even leave to get you to do your choirs. Your father left to fight the damned. Your brother left to find you and get you off the streets where you would have surely died." 	As the words came from his mother's mouth Nickoli couldn’t believe what she was saying. It was treason! Yet, he couldn't deny that he knew it was true. The G.F was never very kind to them and he always felt they were the secret enemy. "Momma. Listen to me. Go to the Boyurs down the road. Give me the keys to the house and the closets and go be safe. I will find papa and Vlad and well all come and see you by the morning. Ok?" 	With the dazed look deepening and here realization of what was going on outside increasing she nodded in agreement, handed him her key ring and walked outside. After he could tell she was gone, safe down the street and close to the Boyurs farm, he locked the doors and took his fathers gun from the rack that was in his parent’s room. He locked the front door and walked down the street towards the pyre that was his home and city less than two hours ago. 	This town square was designed just like most others. It may even resemble the one in your town. It had one large, open area with four roads intersecting, one from each side. There was a large statue of Cyser Gestl, founder of the Galactic Federation, planted smack dab in the middle. Unlike your community, most likely, it was in the engulfed in a civil war. Nickoli approached fro the southern corner of the market. He could see lines of federation troopers lined up like the ranks of stone that built the buildings in the city. He fired a shot from his small 22-gestyr rifle into the files of soldiers. One fell dead, right in front of the other soldiers. All they did was knock him out of the way and continue to shot at the small bands of rebels fighting to the north and the east. He continued to fire into the rows of soldiers, all the time the only person that ha notice him shooting from the other side of the center was dead. Nickoli had placed a shoot of pure energy through his temple.  	The forces on each side of the battle began to grow thin. The G.F troops had suffered far more casualties at this point than the colonists had, yet they had now just begun to even out in the number of actual men. Then a grand roar rose up from the eastern battalion. The leader rose from his makeshift trench and ordered his men to rush the general line. A sea of bodies ran towards the area that the G.F stood. Nickoli could not see who had given the order to rush the enemy line but by the time the actual rush had begun he could see the two that were out and in front in all the fighting. They were his brother and his papa.  	His father, being a rather large and well-built man, was cleaving the bodies of men in the crucible that had been created in the center of the town. The troops in the northern corner of continued to inflict casualties from their protected position. Nickoli protected his kin from the would-be "heroes" that were aiming to kill them. Then, it happened. His shoot missed his target and hit a trooper standing in front of him. The G.F warrior followed through with his step and ran the length of his bayonet into Nickoli's father's belly. The soldier, who from looking at his build could have been much older than Nickoli himself, pulled his weapon out and continued to fight.  	Hatred boiled up inside of him. His thought became dry and he couldn’t speak. He raised his gun right toward the head of the soldier that had just butchered his papa. The young recruit turned and saw Nickoli. And Nickoli saw him. For a split second they connected on some psychic level and the only words in the mind of the small farmers son was "Die mother Fucker." The connection broke and Nickoli pulled the trigger. The battle slowed to a crawl. You could see the movement of the bolt as it burned the ozone in the plaza. When the blast finally got close enough to the soldier’s head his eyes opened wide and you could see his mouth form "Fuc..”. Then his head was gone. From the base of the neck to the top of his head he there was nothing, were 5 seconds beforehand there had been a living breathing thinking being. 	As Nickoli was focusing in on his fathers killer a sniper on the other roof, a G.F. troop, had gotten him in his sight. Just as Nickoli had pulled the trigger Vladimir Ronsiov noticed the sniper and his target. With a yell of "Nickoli!" Vlad jumped into the direct line of the sniper. He let out a load howl of unbelievable pain. Imagine the loss of a leg to a thousand small knives and then imagine those knives being coated in iodine. That is a fraction of the amount of pain caused by an energy bolt. The sound of his brother’s death wail brought Nickoli back to reality. Turning and raising his position he shoot the arm of the sniper clean off. He turned and stared in a look of pure disgust at the boiling stump that used to be his arm. 	And then, it just ended. The firing stopped, the bodies fell and the men calmed themselves. All the G.F troops were dead. Nickoli walked forward to the center of the square, where a hush and silence had befallen all the men that a moment before had been bloodthirsty monsters. Nickoli was the only one that was moving. He stopped, looked at everyone in the plaza, turned and took aim. He pulled pack his trigger for the last time that day and shoot the head off of the statue of Cyser Gestl. He looked at the men again, walked to the statue and began to clime. All was silent, not a man spoke. Then as he reached the top he let out a yell of mixed victory and sorrow. "Viva la Revolution!" he cried out so that all men in the city could hear him. All the old farmers and young men, now soldiers, yelled with him. Then what had been a little boy began to cry. He sat on the top of the statue and cried into the night.

      Hi everybody. I just want to say something before I do anything else. There is a God. I dont care who it is, what religion is right, or any of that ti-for-tat bullshit. God decided to listen when I asked for a girlfriend, for someone who makes me feel good about myself and good about the world. Im not gonna go all religious and everything, but i would just like to firmly state my position, and there is a God. So, on that note: This is to Sabina.    Earth Angel  By: Jesse Belvin and Curtis Williamson  Earth angel, earth angel, will you be mine? My darling dear, love you all the time. I'm just a fool, a fool in love, with you.  Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore, Love you forever, and ever more. I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.  I fell for you, and I knew, The vision of your love, loveliness. I hope and I pray, that some day, I'll be the vision of your hap hapiness Oh  Earth angel earth angel, please be mine, My darling dear, love you all the time, I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you  I fell for you, and I knew, The vision of your lovliness. I hope and I pray, that someday, That I'll be the vision of your happiness.  Earth angel earth angel, please be mine, My darling dear, love you all the time, I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you  So, now to fill everybosy who might feel out of the loop in. I met this freshman girl named Sabina a little while before Christmas timeish. Shes was really funny, a blast to hang around with, and just a great person. We went on a date, but her stepdad didnt like the concept of her dating someone older then her. Flashforward to about two weeks ago. Sabinas mother and step-father are getting a divorce. We started talking a little bit more and became increasingly envolved. She asked me to Sadie Hawkins, just as friends. We sort of beat around the bush for a while, and some things happened between her and some friends of hers that im not going to talk about, but the long and short of it is we are dateing now. Now that I have been granted by deepest wish: I have a girlfriend and I am sooooooooooooo happy its not even funny.

      I have the internet back! Thank the sweet zombie Jesus!     Its taken about four months for me to get back on and do this. Hot damn, how things have happened. Lets just start at the beginning of my absensce and work forward shall we? I went to my grandparents house in Arizona for Christmas and just hung out with the redneck kin for about a week and a half. Had lots of food. (Hmmmm.... fooooddd..) I got a new computer and a cable conncetion for christmas, and my dad bought himself a new car so i kind of inverbaitimly got the Saturn. But hell im not complaining. We got back just in time for me to go and see the Rose Parade with Sara Kaplan and her family as well as someone I didnt expect to see.     Gina Hooper, the little sister of Todd Hooper ,whom ive been a friend with since about the fourth grade,was there. Now, Gina is an 8th grader and im a Junior, so the last thing I was thinking about when I walked into Sara's house was: how can I hook up with someone three years younger then I am? Thats kind of what ended up happening though, as me and Gina spent most of the time flirting. I went home feeling happy that I had connected with a great person and that she felt similarly, but also feeling a little weird. Well, once Todd found out he was neigh pleased and made it his mission to rip my head off and fead it to a pack of rabid mongesses whenever he got the chance.  Once I got the Internet back we started talking but as some time whent by she felt her parents wouldnt approve so she wanted to scale things back. I dont know what she thinks at this point, but im always here.     My birthday has come and gone, with little fanfare, and yet again I squandered what money I was granted. I have an 88.1 percent in my Ap History class, and its only going up as we do more homework, but when ever we take a test it gets kicked in the nuts for at least 5%. Jazz band has become increasingly hard, as Mr. Witten is now forceing us to memorize scales. So far we have tested on the Blues scales and the Major scales, each test i have througly bombed worse then Dubba bombed Saddam. Monday we test on the Mixolydian Mode (Major Scales with a lowered Seventh scale degree), and I have finally had a free weekend in which to practice. My horn is in my living room and it will be superglued to my mouth all day tommorrow and Sunday. I think i can get this one down pat. All of my other classes remain the same.     I saw Mel Gibson's controversial film, "The Passion of The Christ" and found it to be one of the most enjoyable, moving experiances ive ever had at the Movies. The violence, condemmed by some as excessive is very effective at showing the inhumanity of man, and at the same thime it did not feel excessive as it was done completely in context. There are two scenes that are now eternaly burned into the back of my skull. Prior to the crucifixtion the Roman's are torturing Jesus they whip his back with a Cat-o-Nine tails that has fish hooks on the end. The Roman over-extended and rips the... well, Jesus out of him, exposeing three of his ribs to the air. Then, at the actual Crucifixtion jesus does not fit onto the cross. One of the Romans comes over and, in one of the most callous desplays i have ever seen, knocks the other two Centurions out of the way and says 'Let me show you how it's done." He grabs Jesus' arm and pulls until you can hear the gut-wrenching pop of the shoulder dislocating from the socket. All through out the movie the singular thought that appeared in my head in between the moments of horrific mutilation and dietal self-sacrifice was "I'm going to hell. Mary Magdaline is hot. And thats all I can think about as God is dieing in front of me. Im going to hell."   Sadie Hawkins is coming up and it symbolizes the second most single depressing times to be a single guy of the year (the first being Valentine's Day of coarse.). I am, yet again, single and waiting in pointless anticipation for someone to ask me. I reiterate my point from the last time I posted.  I need a chick sooooooooooooo................. bad.   Lol, o well. Night everybody and have a good time. Just remember: Jesus loves you but everybody else thinks your a cock.

      There are days when you want to shout for joy from the mountaintops of the world. There are days when you want to shrink from the pain and fall into the pit. Today was somewhere juxtaposed between these two extremes. I just want someone to tell me how to feel. Im happy because she said shed try. Im sad because I dont think shell be able to go. Im happy because I think she loves someone very much. Im wretched because I know its not me. I cant blame her for her emotions, because they come from a place trapt within the soul, unreachable and unchartable. In the end, you can only smile and nod.

      In your Eyes by Peter Gabriel  love I get so lost, sometimes days pass and this emptiness fills my heart when I want to run away I drive off in my car but whichever way I go I come back to the place you are  All my instincts, they return and the grand facade, so soon will burn without a noise, without my pride I reach out from the inside  in your eyes the light the heat in your eyes I am complete in your eyes I see the doorway to a thousand churches in your eyes the resolution of all the fruitless searches in your eyes I see the light and the heat in your eyes oh, I want to be that complete I want to touch the light the heat I see in your eyes  love, I don't like to see so much pain so much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away I get so tired of working so hard for out survival I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive  and all my instincts, they return and the grand facade, so soon will burn without a noise, without my pride I reach out from the inside  in your eyes the light the heat in your eyes I am complete in your eyes I see the doorway to a thousand churches in your eyes the resolution of all the fruitless searches in your eyes I see the light and the heat in your eyes oh, I want to be that complete I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes in your eyes in your eyes in your eyes in your eyes in your eyes in your eyes   This will probley make a whole lot more sense tommorrow.

      99 Red Ballons  You and I in a little toy shop, buy a bag of ballons with the money weve got. Set them free at the break of Dawn, till one by one, they were gone. Back at base, bugs in the software Flash the message, Something's out there, Floating in the summer sky. 99 red balloons go by.  99 red balloons, floating in the summer sky. Panic bells, it's red alert. There's something here from somewhere else. The war machine springs to life, Opens up one eager eye. Focusing it on the sky, Where 99 red balloons go by.  99 Decision Street. 99 ministers meet. To worry, worry, super-scurry. Call the troops out in a hurry. This is what we've waited for. This is it boys, this is war. The president is on the line As 99 red balloons go by.  99 Knights of the air Ride super-high-tech jet fighters Everyone's a superhero. Everyone's a Captain Kirk. With orders to identify. To clarify and classify. Scramble in the summer sky. As 99 red balloons go by.  99 dreams I have had. In every one a red balloon. It's all over and I'm standing pretty. In this dust that was a city. If I could find a souvenier. Just to prove the world was here. And here is a red balloon I think of you and let it go.   Gotta love German pop. For some reason this little song about the complete and utter destruction of every man, women and child on the planet brings a smile to my face.    One of my friends has been having one hell of a week. Im not going to talk about it, because its not my place to, but she got hurt preety bad. She doesnt deserve the pain and I hope she finds someone who can make her happy.  So, if she reads this, she can have herself a little smile. =)

      Customer: They say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good... are either one of these any good?  Randal: What?  Customer: Are either one of these any good?  Randal: I don't watch movies.  Customer: Well, have you heard anything about either one of them?  Randal: I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.  Customer: You mean you've haven't heard anybody say anything about either one of these?  Randal: Nope.  Customer: [Turns around, then shows Randal the same movies] Well, what about these two?  Randal: Oh, they suck.  Customer: These are the same two movies! You weren't paying any attention!  Randal: No, I wasn't.  Customer: I don't think your manager would appreciate...  Randal: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.  Customer: I beg your pardon?  Randal: Your ruse; your cunning attempt to trick me.  Customer: I was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying!  Randal: And, I hope it feels good.  Customer: You hope WHAT feels good?  Randal: I hope it feels so good to be right. There's nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?  Customer: Well, this is the last time I rent here!

      Kill Bill was amazing. In the event that you have not seen the film yet, stop reading, get out of your computer chair and go see this motherfucking movie. No joke. See this god damn mother fucking movie right now or you can never see another movie ever again and feel human. Back? Seen the movie? Good.  Bill's monologue about Superman was amazing. The jist of it is that Superman and Clark Kent are unique in the Superhero mythology. Batman is Bruce Wayne. Spiderman is Peter Parker. But, when Green Lantern wakes up in the morning and goes to bed at night hes still Hal Jordan. Superman is unique in the fact that when he wakes up hes Superman. He was born Superman. Clark Kent is this thinly veiled attempt to hide amongst normal people. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the nature of Humanity. He is weak, clumsy, nervous and unsure of himself. Superman is essentialy displaying a subconcience sense of superiority for and disdain for the Human Race. Now, this next part is not in the film, but it is mine. Lex Luthor, while evil, represents the complete opposite of Clark Kent. Lex Luthor is the real super man. He is the embodiment of humanity and all that it is capable of, in its balls to the wall and blunt nature. By creating Lex Luthor and his relationship with Kent/Superman represents Man's struggle with what he  is  (Luthor) and what he  wishes  he could be (Kent).  Back to the film. Pei Mei was hilarious! Absolutely fucking hilarious. No joke, I laughed harder at Kill Bill then I did at some comedies I have watched. The way that Quentin Tarantino used the odd filter that created that dated, aged, Kung Fu film feel during the scenes of her training was great. Elle losing her eyes in two equally random monets was perhaps one of the most interesting moments I have ever seen laid to celluloid.  Tarantino has created a drive in me to go out and watch all of these old Spagetti Westerns and Kung Fu films that have created the art form that is Pulp Fiction (hehe, allow me my Tarantino joke).  I reiterate my point. I have seen it twice since it was released (lol, and I watched Volume 1 every day for five days after I bought it so...). It is amazingly worth it. Go see this motherfuckingmovie.    The top Five movies of all time (In no particular order) Pulp Fiction Kill Bill (One movie, dont care what people say. If you have to be a pain in the ass, Volume 2 is better.) Clerks Edward Scissorhands Confessions of a Dangerous Mind   Dont trust me? Go watch  all  those movies and then we'll sit down and debate them all. I can do it for hours.

      My spring breal has been boring as all hell. Ive done one or two productive things but really I havent done shit. I might play D&D tonight, but im not sure. I need to get my merit badges done..... But im not going to do it tonight. Rambleing is always good.   For anyone who hasnt seen it yet, heres the beginning of a screenplay im working on for a film I want to make with friends of mine in Media Tech.  THE COMIC SHOP A screenplay by William French  Character List Luke Miller- A single white male, Age 24. Luke is the archtypical comic book nerd. He owns his own comic book store, Comics N' Stuff, the local den of pronounced nerdom. While single he is becoming increasingly envolved with one of the few females that enter the store for any reason other then asking where the tatoo parlor is, Alice. Luke is the proud owner of the original prop lightsaber used by David Prowse in his role as Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Armed with a razor sharp wit and a deep abiding hatred for Star Trek and Archie Comics, Luke  runs afoul trekkies and angry parents with nothing better to do then berate his managment abilities.   George Nelson- A single white male, Age 24. George is Luke's fifth appendage. Best friends since the third grade when they got into a spirited debate about how the Twin Ion Engine of a TIE Fighter works, George and Luke have been esentially inseperable since then. His ability to retain useless information concerning to pointless topics has made George a god amongst nerd, createing a sagelike following around him. It has been said that George has watched the Original Star Wars trilogy, Lord of The Rings, and The Matrix Trilogy more often then any man on the planet (with the possible exception of Luke.) George compensates for this amazing talent by owning The Imperial Ink, a tatoo parlor next door to Comics N' Stuff, ergo surrounding himself in beutiful women.  Hal Bengier- The Canadian. A bit slow on the uptake because of extensive use of ganga, Hal is none the less well meaning. Obstenant and closed minded, argueing with Hal is like bludgeoning your head against a brick wall. All it does is produce a pissed off person and a non-the-less unchanged wall. He is the friend that everyone loves but at the same time hates with a passion.  Toby Quesada- The Prodigy. Though Toby is only sixteen years old he has already showed massive potential. Having memorized the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook, Toby is a force to be reackoned with. Passive-Agressive, Toby has a very biting, some times annoying wit that strikes like a tiger when his is angered. Toby has a Napolean complex that defys description. Though a good kid he contains the vanity and festering anger that is reminisant of a young Anakin. As George is well known to say "The Force is strong with this one."  Milton Moore- The Voice. A disembodied voice. Though Milton basically lives in Comics N' Stuff, he is never quite in view. Weither he is locked in the bathroom, hidden behind rows and rows of comic books, sleeping underneath the table or the counter, Milton is the concience of the perverted dwellers of the store.   Mark Tyler- The noob. Still in middle school, at 13 Mark is the youngest of our characters, both in age and ability. He loves DC Comics. He only plays Green in Magic. He spends five minutes gathering Minerals and Vespin Gas. Hell hath no demon more foul or imp more annoying than a noob, and Mark is a noob's noob.  The Trekkie- Evil. Pure unadaltureated, evil. He worships at the alter of Shatner and must be destroyed.   Alice Morgan- A 23 year old Art Major at UCLA, Alice is the only thing without a penis that intentionaly comes into the store thats not looking for a late bill. Quiet and kind, Alice is a gifted artist who has a quasi-silent crush on Luke. Bright Red hair and a collection of Jhonen Vasquez  comics are her signatures. Foul mouthed and sharpminded, Alice is more then an intellectual match for any of the stores inhabitants. Plus she has a secret weapon: Boobs.  Frank- Known only as Frank, he owns The Negative Zone, the wholesale nerd Mecca where Luke purchases his product from. If any rare memorobillia comes onto the market, its as sure as shooting Womp Rats in Beggers canyon with a proton torpedo that hes heard about it.    Face shot of Luke's face at ground level with the bed. he faces the camera, with a dazed and confused look on his face. Freeze Frame.  *Voiceover* 	LUKE: My name is Lucas Miller. I was born in a movie theater in southern California on May 21st, 			1980, during the first screening of "The Empire Strikes Back."  Zoom to the Edwards marquee with "The Empire Strikes Back" up in lights.  Inside the theater pan from left to right. Stop at Mary and Blake. Cloud City appears on the screen, while Mary's face becomes construed. Her water breaks and Blake reaches to help her.   		BLAKE: Holy Shit! Ok honey, stay calm and just breath.  		MARY: *Lamaze breathing*  Luke finally arives in the world, angled over Blake's shoulder, looking at Mary's face. She's crying and smiling, baby is raised into view. Cuts to theater screen with Vader.  		VADER: Luke, I am your father.  Baby Luke wails his head off. Pan from Vader into store. Title fades into screen and then back out. Pull back from TV untill the Camera is positioned looking inward from the door towards the couch, with Luke, Hal, Toby and Mark sitting watching "The Empire Strikes Back."  Close up of Toby, tight around the face.  		Toby: Vader single handedly killed hundreds of thousands of Jedi, perhaps the most    powerful beings in the universe.   Freeze Frame.  *voiceover*	LUKE: This is Toby Quesada. Toby is a bit of a prodigy. For being 16 he's one smart mother fucker. He built a Nuclear reactor out of the motor from a 1984 Cutlass and a Microwave. Though no relation to the editor and chief of Marvel Comics, he did meet him at Comicon last year.  Impressed him so much he got him to sell and sign him an original copy of Guardian Devil. 	  Cut to close up of Hal, again, tight around the face.  		HAL: But... Luke owns his ass at the end of Jedi!  Freeze Frame  *voiceover*	LUKE: This is Hal Bengier. Everyone has a Hal in their group. The guy who smoked a little too much weed in High School so now he cant make a valid point if his life depends apon it, yet is so fucking obstinant that the arguments never end. Weve been friends since the seventh grade, but I swear to god, Half the time I want to throw his ass over the railing. 	  Cut to close up of Luke.  		LUKE: Yea, but thats because he gave up and threw the Emperor into the heart of the Death Star! If he hadnt pussied out, Vader could fuck Luke's little bitch Jedi-wannabe ass up.  Zoom to a shot of the Bathroom door.  		MILTON: Are you watching the movie? Vader cuts Luke's fucking hand off and sends it flying to oblivion. He lets his own fucking kid fall to his presumed death. Vader would win, end of story. Not even in the same ballpark.  *voiceover* 	LUKE: This ambigious voice is that of Milton J. Moore. In five years of owning this shop, most have never seen Milton. He is kind of the stores unofficial mascot. He's here from opening to closeing everyday, asleep under the tables, moving amongst the racks, and generaly hidden from view, if not from mind.  Cut back to the four guys sitting on the couch looking towards Hal.  		HAL: None of you have given me one good reason why Vader would win.  		LUKE: I only need one and its right there.  *Points towards the counter*  Shot of the lightsaber in its case above the counter. Zoom in and as the camera gets in closer the light around the lightsaber becomes increaseingly intense.  *voiceover*	Luke: The original prop Lightsaber used by David Prowse in his role as Darth Vader in the single best movie ever made, The Empire Strikes Back. Entrusted to me on my Eighteenth birthday, my parents saved money for three years and travled to every swap meet and trade show on the west coast trying to find me this Holy Grail of Nerdom.  *Bell rings* Cut to shot of bell ringing as the door opens.  Cut to The Trekkie walking into the store in in full Federation Captains uniform, with a phaser at his side. He gives the store a once over.  Cut to the guys on the couch. They slowly turn their heads. The Trekkie's eyes lock with Luke's. *OK corral music* The gang stands and reaches for their lightsabers. Trekkie reaches for his phaser. The gang draws their lightsabers, making the *fhum* humming sound. Close up of trekkie's eyes, sweat dripping from the brow. Eyes move franticly, counting the Jedi. Deciding hes been out numbered the Trekkie bolts for the door.  		TREKKIE: Whoopwopwopwopwopwowop.  The Jedi turn. Fade to black.  Cut to the guys sitting a table in the back of the store. D&D paraphanallia is strewn across the table, as well as drinks and food. Milton is in the storage room scroungeing for food.  		LUKE: Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room. The pungent stench of mildew eminates from the wet dungeon walls. 		MILTON: Where are the Cheetos! 		LUKE: Theyre right next to you. 		MARK: I cast a spell. 		MILTON: Wheres the Mountain Dew! 		LUKE: In the fridge, duh! 		MARK: I wanna cast a spell!  		MILTON: Can I have a Mountain Dew?

Man, I got a Ogre-slaying knife. Its got a +9 against Ogres. 		LUKE: Your not there, your in the bar getting drunk! 		MILTON: Ok, but if there are any girls there I wanna do them!    Thats it for right now. I know most of the jokes are esoteric and a wee bit nerdy, but trust me, if you undertsand it its fucking hilarious.

      Alright. Ive been having this amazingly complicated nerd arguement with diffrent people ever since I saw Clerks the other day. In Clerks the main characters, Dante and Randall, have a discussion about weither or not the contractors on the Second Death Star were innocent civilians who were just doing their jobs.    Taking a lot of notes from Randall's initial point of view, here is my take on it. The production of the Second Death Star was stepped up to combat the increaseing Rebel threat, so much so that it would have far exceeded the Imperial Military's ability to construct the weapon in synch with their own scheduale. Independent, civialian contractors would have to hav been brought in to finish the project. These contractors didnt nessacarily know what they were working on, considering the size and scope of the project. Most likely the mojority of these workers only saw their peice of the puzzel, never the entire project. They could not be held responsible for the Empire.    A point of conflict is the moral one. They were working for the Empire so they must be evil. Lets say you are a independent contractor and the United States government offers you a huge government contract to build barracks in the middle of Arizona. You accept because theres a shitload of money involved and it seems like a simple and innocent enough project. Your on the job one day and a bunch of left-wing militants blow the fuck out of the place. Your wife is now a widow and your kids starve. If the Alliance, and latter its non-militarized version in the New Republic, stand for civilian rights and the freedom of trade and choice they say to, then these families deserve reperations for the economical and mental stress that was dealt to them during wartime.      Thank you for listening to the rambleings of a Nerd on something that has absolutely no real world applications.

      Ive been trying to go to bed now for about an hour and a half.  Its not working. I forgot I had English homework, so now im wreaking my brain trying to remember exactly what the hell I was supposed to write for that Yearbook assignment in Akin about Myrtle from the Great Gatsby. I havent even begun to work on my History paper. Im missing the second half of the Fetal Pig Dissection on Wensday because I have to go to this "Student of the Month" Assembly during first period. Im preety sure homework isnt my strong point.... Do you ever go to a resteraunt and at the end of the meal it comes time to pay the check and the tip and everyone has put in more then enough for the meal and barely enough for the tip? We went to Fridays after the Colorguard show on friday night and at the end Roland, Chandler, Kevin Dion and I split our part of the bill because the table got divided funky. I only got a Brownie Obsession and a drink (which come out, roughly to about 7$ before tax and tip). I know everyone put in their fair share and i start handleing the money but I just couldnt figure out how the hell to get the tip right with the money we had there, so I end up paying like 16$, all the meanwhile Chandler's giving me this dirty look like "Why the fuck are you still going over the money, youve been doing this for like ten minutes." Whatever, in the end the chick got a good ten-twelve dollar tip so im fufilled. I made one of the stupidest decisions of my entire life this morning after my mom compared my gorrila legs to Robin Williams, so you'll all get a good laugh tommorrow.  Thats enough randomness, maybe ill be able to sleep now that its midnight.

      This past hour is the most time ive spent at home in like three days. Ive been running around being a nerd since friday because my parents were out of town. They went and saw Shamu (I'll be damned if I can spell the Whale's name, and im not about to look it up. so there.) and this new breed of Mini-Dolphins at Sea-World.  I hung out with a friend who moved to Florida at the end of last year for most of the weekend. Just chilled and played cards. Watched some movies. Good times. Hes a good guy and he might be moving back out here at the beginning of the year.  O well. Time to go to bed and hope I can get stuff done for my history report tommorrow. Woot for federal holidays.

       The Steward of Gondor   Home is behind The world ahead There are many paths to tread Trough shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow, cloud and shade All shall fade All shall fade  The Single most chilling moment ever captured in a Fantasy/Science Fiction movie. Pippen's innocene spoiled and the cold realization that evil exists in a very real fashion rushes into the young face.

      Last night was Prom night, which I spent at my friends house watching  Fight Club  and swimming in his pool. It doesnt bother me that much that I didnt go, because if I couldnt go with the person I really wanted to there was no point to go anyway. To everybody who did go, I hope you had a marvelous time, and impart every freakin detail to me tommorrow at school.  If anyone reads this who isnt completely dead from Prom or Prom-night activities and feels like going to see  Troy  or  Shrek 2  or something, give me a call on my cell.

      As legions of demons and hellspawn crash into the alley way Spike turns to Angel and asks "What do we do now?" The vampire non-chilantly answers "We Fight." "Could you be more specific?" "Well. Me,personally, Id like to kill a dragon."  I like how Angel ended. =)  Smallville, on the other hand was messed up. What the hell was with the bomb? And when (and how) the hell did Jor-El come back? I havent watched this show in so long that I guess some of this makes sense, but im missing it. Chloe was far, far hotter then Lana is. I cant believe this shit.... Who the hell kills that great of a character? Fucking horrible writers. Messing up Superman....

      Im tired. Ive got a headache. And a bunch of munchkins beat the shit out of me at my Boy Scout meeting today, so my back hurts like a mother. My mommy went to the Hospital this morning to have Gall Stones removed. She'll be off her feet for about two weeks, so the family gets to run around and wait on her hand and foot. That should be fun. Im 0-3 as far as prom dates are concerned. People have been trying to tell me to go stag and ive go to tell yea.... Prom just seems so couple oriented that going Stag just seems so anti-climactic and meaningless that ive kind of ruled that out as even a remote posibility in my mind. O well. Im going to talk to Liane for a little bit more and then go to bed.

      I dont think im going to Prom. Carols parents wouldnt let her go. So, yea, im kind of sad, kind of mellow but I'm not sure exactly what the hell im going to do. I might go stag. But thats lame. Prom is one of those few things that requires a date to be half as fun as its supposed to be. O well.... Off to school.

      I really need to stop going to bed at One O'clock in the morning. Usually it wouldnt get to me, but after a week of doing it, im starting to feel it. Hung out at Xaos last night. For those who arent initiated into the world of nerdom, Xaos is a store over by In-N-Out that specializes in the sale of Card and Role-Playing games. Ive been more or less a regular fixture there for more five years now, but recently I havent been able to get out as much as id like. (Damn AP bullshit..... i shouldnt be studying... im too young for this shit.) Any way, for anyone interested in getting into the nerd community, I hardily endorse this sevice and/or product. Good people, fun times, and a whole lot of random shit.    So, I asked Carol Ralls to go to Prom with me as a friend. This is the third time ive tried to find a date for this thing, and if she cant go I going to officaily give up and go and cry in a corner. Hopefully her parents wil be cool (hell, for that matter, hopefully my parents will be cool), and well be able to go. It should be fun, going in a limo with Rolandandliane, and Roumie my Homie. Good times will be had by all.    Random thought for the day: Do I look like Quentin Tarantino? While i was hanging out at the store last night some new guy who was a friend of another one of the regulars told me that I look like him. This isnt the first time ive heard this, but I just dont have a clue if its a truthful or accurate statement. What does everyone think?

      Ok. Im going to recap what may have well been the worst week of my life (with the little trademark sign). im just going to run down the list of things that happened to me that made the beginning of the week horrendous and the week end much less so.  Saturday: That false sense of security from that damn fortune cookie.   Sunday: Continued with that false sense of security and confidence that the week was going to be a good one.  Monday: Expected, but none the less demoralizing, rejection. Being told that I was not going to be invited back to Jazz Band next year.  Tuesday: Finding out I might move to Iowa (It's a long story, if youd like to know, ask me online because I dont feel like talking about it in person.)  Wensday: Sitting in self-loathing. Studying my butt off for the stupid AP History test I would take on Friday.  Thursday: Failed my driving exam. (Now, this is where the week began to pick up.) Talked to Brittany for an extended period of time online. She sent me an online survey thingy that posted this question: "Of all your friends, if you could date someone who would it be?" To which I replied: "I would ask Brittany to prom." So now were going as friends and I am considrably more freakin happy then I was the rest of the week. =)  Friday: Took my AP History test. Have you ever studied for something to such a point that you think you know it. Your not sure you know it, but you think you do, so your expecting the test to knock you on your back when you take it? That was the feeling going into this thing. And the multiple choice questions surely reinforced this point. But the essay questions were preety easy (in my humble, messed up opinion) and im fairly confident about the test overall. Following that three hour peice of joy I had no intention of going to my Geometrey class, so I just went to the media tech room and slept through the rest of the school day. After school Brittany and I went to my house and hung around in my horrendously dirty living room, watching  Varsity Blues . Good times. =) *As an aside note, if youve never seen  Varsity Blues  go out and watch it. Its worth every moment just to see the controlling dad get hit in the nose and the mascots getting hit in the nuts by a mighty powerful football.* Went to the Rednecks house afterwards and hung out. Helped him work on Bugzilla a little bit, then came home and watched  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom .   Saturday: I woke up and found myself scrambling to get ready for one of my friends Eagle Scout Court of Honor. I have known Todd Hopper since I was in the fourth grade, if not before hand. He has proven to be the most loyal, trustworthy, loveable guy I have ever known. I never felt prouder to be a Boy Scout when I saw Todd up on the stage at his church and his mother was there crying over how far he has come. Almost every concience memory I have about scouting is some way related to Todd Hopper, and I am a much better person for having known him. After the ceremony finished Todd, myself and a group of friends went back to his house to play around on the computers, but that feel through due to complicated bumbling on Richards part. We ended up going to Blockbuster and renting  Reservoir Dogs . Not the greatest peice in the Quentin Tarantino library, and the acting is sub-par in some places, but I think the performance over all is better then Todd would like to have admitted.   This all being said and done, its a new week and things are looking up. I have  Reservoir Dogs  until next Saturday. I can go and take my driving exam over again in two weeks. I have about 4 months worth of Anime that I borrowed from Josh Rooney to keep me busy and, to top it all of with a marachino cherry I have a date for Prom with a beutiful and funny girl. Thinks are relativly good, and if I dont have to end up moving to hell come the end of the summer, they'll be even better.

      Fuck the god damn mother fuckers who make those fucking psuedo-Chinese, quasi-mystical, bullshit fortune cookies. To say the least of my day, the cookilied and it can eat my white ass. Today was possibly the worst day of my entire shoolgoing life. Fuck that fucking desert.  Fisrt I find out that the girl I asked to prom cant go. Which is cool, because we were only going to go as friends and her parents didnt want to pay for it. Completely reasonable. Then during lunch my band director calls me into his office and politely tells me that ive fucked up so bad that im not going to be in Jazz band next year. And hes right. Thats the worst fucking part. I was worried so much about my other classes that I completley stopped practicing for jazz band. Im the only person I have to blame but still I would just like to say:    FUCK THAT GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKING COOKIE

      This is an open invitation to anyone and everyone who has no plans for 4th of July. Every year my grandparents have a Barbeque at their house in Garden Grove,light off Chinatowns worth of fireworks out on their street, then walk down the street aways and watch the fireworks from Disneyland. Its always a hell of a time, and this is the first year ive really been able to invite people. Lots and lots of food, my oddball extended family and old movies. Nothing better. If anyones interested just give me a call on my cell phone or leave a comment. Hope everyone can make it. =)

      "Hardball", the book assigned for the AP Government summer assignment, has proven allusive (as most out of print books do.) I went to Borders, Walden Books and another rink-a-dink book store in search of this book that I really have no intrest in reading. *shrug*, So is life. O well. Maybe after I pay back the 2700$ or so its going to cost to fix my car I'll be able to get around to reading Clinton's memoirs. Hopefully thatll be sooner then later.

      Holy fucking shit. I dont quite know how to put this, because im still a little shooken up by this, but about an hour and a half ago I got im my first accident. Ive only had my licence a week so, under the vain assumption that I was invincible and infallable, I tried to cut a guy off on the curve on Santa Ana Canyon Road, coming out of the festival center. That worked out fine, except when I tried to turn onto Eucalyptus out of the curve I was going way too fast to make it. Instead, I hit the side of a Family of Fours SUV, lodging my left front headlight into their rear drivers side door. It is now official: I am the single biggest NOOB on the planet and will be locked away in my home for the majority of the summer, going to Work and the College only. I have to pay off the bill for the repairs to both his car and my own. Guess what that means kiddies? Means my ass is glued at work for the next three to four months, and a fair well to any form of social life over summer. Its my own fault I think in the end most of the punishment will be self-immposed. After about ten minutes of thinking about it right after the accident I came to a simple conclusion: You fucked up. You Fucked up, real, real bad. No more bullshit, no more blaming other people for your problems and your mistakes. Hone up and stop trying to save your own ass every second. And thats what im doing. So, for anyone who wants to know, heres whats going to be going on with me till Band Camp: Im going to be at home, online alot. I cant go anywhere. Actually, scratch that. I wont go anywhere. My cell phone is always on if anyone would like to talk. I leave for Washington DC on the 2nd of August sometime between 11 at night and 2 in the morning, I truthfully have no idea when.  If youd like to see me off, id be appreciated. Im going to be posting more, seeing as its all im going to be doing at night. Other than that, ill see you at Band Camp.

      To every one who imed me tonight: I am really sorry. I forgot to turn my computer off before I headed out with Greg for the evening. It didnt even dawn on me untill I walked through my door. (My garage door, by the way. Why the hell do people lock theur front doors in Anaheim freakin Hills? The whole point of living in this community is the safety it affords you.) Greg, thank you for the road trip. Sorry everyone else fell through and you were left with just me for company, but it was enjoyable and more then welcome. If you've never taken the time to drive out to the desert and just stare at the stars, get out of you chair as soon as the sun goes down and drive. Just start driving. And don't stop until you reach the part of the world where the blanket of smog peels away and reveals a night sky full of mystery, wonder and perfection. Like God painting a picture on the sky.

      School is over! (For a whole week in my case, but thats a diffrent story completely...) I hope everyone had fun at Tom's Place on friday. Sitting around the band room before graduation was interesting. Wheels, you are a stupid, stupid, loveable bastard. Hometown Buffet is amazing. If anyone ever has a desire to go to dinner randomly, I am always willing to go to Hometown Buffet. 10$ at Hometown = All you can eat. Good times, thanx Sam and Roland. Spent the rest of the weekend just messing around and playing D&D with the goggle of gamers. Summer is going to be fun, and next years going to be even better.

      So, yea. This has been one crazy ass week. Over the past 7 days the following things have happened: - I got a job at Mervyn's, and went and took my Drug test. I start on the 21st and get minimum wage baby! - Mr. Thompson came to school today and showed off the baby. (As an aside note baby speak, real baby speak spoken by a kid under 5, is the single most melting sound in the world. He told me that the greatest feeling in the world is coming home from class at 6 at night, putting his keys in the door and hearing her yell "DaDa!" from behind the door.) - AP Government might not be the best class next year, but at the very least there will be an abundance of good friends in the class, and it is not humanly possible for the teacher to be worse at her job than Mr. Valencia was this year.   - I found out that I am going to be the Opinion Editor for Smoke Signals beyond a doubt next year. Thats going to be alot of work, but it will be well worth it and will give me a wealth of opportunities later in life. ( i.e. It looks good on an application.) - I found out that theres going to be like 5-6 Bari Sax players next year, including Greg Porter, and I get to be section leader. - I came to the firm conclusion that if I could have one job to pay the bills that involves writing, I really want to write comics for a living. In the end, I think that would the most fufilling job in the world. (If anyone, I mean   anyone  , can draw worth a damn and is willing to work with my warped, sick, little mind please, please, please talk to me over summer.) - The greatest realization of high school came to me: that whole thing about Senior year being easy? Yea, thats bullshit. Next year is going to be fucking hard. But, there in lays the ray of hope. Nothing easy is worth doing, so, i'm inclined to believe that next years going to rip me a new ass hole but itll be the funnest year so far (which isnt saying much I suppose, but none the less.)

      Have you ever felt like you could just get up and leave? Not because your life is particularly bad, but because it isnt particularly good. Because if you left tommorrow and never came back you dont think it will affect anyones life except your own. That life will continue exactly as if you were there, even though your gone? That in 17 years you havent been able to communicate well enough with any one to make your presence in a city make a god damn diffrence?

      After having a mouth bound with plastic and metal for roughly half my life, I am ecstatic to say that as of 3:20 this afternoon I am free of the tyrannical pull of braces. To say the least very, very least, I am a happy boy.

      Bill Clinton is the greatest President of the modern era. I just finished watching his speech at the beginning of the Democratic National Convention, and the time he has spent out of office has, if possible, only increased his already massive talent. Eloquent, middle-of-the-road, uniting words that could only spring from the silver tounge of the golden boy from Arkansas. If, in my carrer I could be a hundreth the public speeker and the leader that President Clinton is then I will be more then fufilled in my thirst for public office. If you did not witness the greatest speech a Democrat has given in the new millenium, shame on you, and heres a link to a transcript.    http://www.dems2004.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=luI2LaPYG&b=131063&amp;ct=158734

      God created math to piss me off. This may seem alittle self-absorbed and egotistical, but I swear, the devine spark of creation that influenced mathematicians was granted purley to make me pull my fucking hair out. I am going to be throughly happy when my class is over on thursday, and I wont have to touch the shit for a year. (Assuming I get off my ass, buckle down and do my freakin homework)

      Late night cartoons are the shit.  Anything not decent enough to show during daylight hours can be found overflowing the corrupt chalace that is television at 11:oo at night. Its a beutiful thing.  Staying up this late to watch late night cartoons.... Not necassarily the best idea. But fun.    I am a happy little nerd today, because I finally found someone to work with me on a comic.  Not going to pull out the big gun yet (Save that for the Big Two), but this first project should do more then good enough to provide us an example for an interview.     Dumbest. Movie. Ever. But im sure it'll be hilarious.  www.haroldandkumar.com

      For some reason Characters without names are more connectable on one level or another. The Beast from (Guess what kids!)  Beutey and the Beast  lacks a name for the sheer purpose that his name is irrelevent. He serves as a vessel through which the audiance can implant themselves into and learn a moral lesson about being compassionate and civil. Cigarette Man, from the X-Files (Horrible peice of ass, of a show, By the way. Possibly the worst science fiction series since the original Star Trek. Thats right. I said it. Shatner is horrible, and the writting is piss poor. Granted, the show did introduce the world to Leonard Nimoy and created the Star Trek universe that would evolve into "The Next Generation", but that hardly makes up for the horrible excuse for a show. X-Files is worse.), is the governments' seditious influence personified. He is the portrait of a soul-less, mind warped hand of a administration bent on keeping secrets secret. The lack of a full, "Christian" name, gives the writer the ability to demonize or altruize (Is that a word?) their character.

      It may not be as hot as I think it is, but it sure as hell feels like its 90+ degrees in my room right now. All I need is a big ass, industrial size fan that blows shit off the walls and ill be fine.  I dont have a good lead in for the next character profile, so lets just get to it.  The eighth greatest character in Comic Book History:   Eric Magnus Lensherr AKA Magneto   Racism is, unfortunately, one of the most base and consistent human emotions. It is also and one of the most difficult to recognize and curtail. Leaders can inspire hope, and give people something to believe in. Leaders can also use that power to infuse a sadistic, corruptive influence on good people who just want a chance for a better life. Magneto is the best example of Man's inhumanity towards Man and the inherent quality of people to forget what has happened to them in life.  The most interesting qualities of Magnus' personality comes from his Judasesque association with Professor Xavier. Divergence in political theories can cause the best of friends to become the most dire of enemies. Thinking Xavier has become complacent and, pardon the phrase, Uncle Tom-ish in his approach to the strife between the Human and Mutant population, Magneto seeks a pre-emptive policy. None the less Magneto does not, in his heart, want to harm people. He merely has his priorities, as skewed as they are. Much like Malcolm X during the birth of the civil rights movement, Erik has little regard for the people he says as corrupt and despotic. In turn he seeks to transplant the pain of this life and wants to experience the level of control he feels others have, yet he lacks over his own life. A man who can control the most powerful natural force on the planet as simple as a piece of paper was powerless to save his child from a mob in post World War II Ukraine, and this inability to control his own destiny is galling to his sense of self.  This brings up the ironic part of Magneto's nature. For a man who was raised in the Concentration Camps of Auschwitz to preach the moral and spiritual superiority of his "Perfect Race", is somewhat fucked up. One would hope that Racism and irrational hatred of people would be a lost part of that generations emotional repertoire, but alas it is not. The contradictions of character loom long and deep in Magneto's life. Walking the line between shadow and light, Magnus did not always subscribe to the hatred and war- mongering he is most identified with. For a time, He was the head of the Xavier Institute and helped the Third Generation of mutants to pass through its halls come of age. Coincidentally, upon graduation these students became a militant, pro-active strike force under the leadership of Cable. Perhaps it was the underlying, seething resentment and desire for control in Magnetos voice and personality that gave the New Mutants that particular spin on "The Dream". In the end Magneto is undeniably human, and that is what makes him such an effective villain. With little provocation, you could become this man. And that is a frightening thought.

      There are only so many funny things you can watch in one day. Invader Zim, Simpsons, Family Guy, Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, and to cap it all off at the end of the day My Big Fat Greek Wedding. My sister came down from Bakersfield yesterday to pick up my nephew, spent the night, and then went home today.             A Summary of my conversation with my sister"             "Hi Liz, how are yo.. O, ok, ill cya later..." O well, thats the consequences of being a 21 year old trying to support her family between a low-income job and a welfare check.     I cant wait for my trip to Washington. I really, really want to get the hell out of my house for something more then work and school. Just three weeks left, and then I get to go and see if im half as enlightened and informed as my ego thinks I am. And following that adventure in the realm of the political I get to come back to Anaheim and go to band camp, rejoining the human race.     Thats all the personal information for the day, and now the public servce announcement:    To anyone who frequents my site and is going to be over the age of 18 by November, please leave your Email adress as a comment. For those of you who dont plan on voting: "The only person you can blame for the state of our country as a non-voter is yourself, so, get off your lazy ass and go to vote for somebody. I dont care if you vote for  the brain of a three year old dead monkey frozen in Carbonite (AKA, Bush) or  the termite eaten entrails of a petrified tree (AKA, Kerry). Personally, im for the tree, but thats another story. Just vote, you lazy sonofabitch."

      I bought  My Life  today. After reading about a hundred of the thousand page collection of memories and annecdotesm I have come to the conclusion that It is, without a doubt, one of the funniest works of non-fiction I have ever read. It conveyes a sense of connectability and humanity that one does not typically apply to Presidents. The stories, ranging from Clinton's experiances with a wayward ram during a summer as a child to how he has learned to cope with the alcoholism of his Step-father, paint a deep and elegant portrait of a man full of love and understanding yet berift with pains and anguish. This is going to sound deeply partisan, and I dont care mind you, but there are days where I wish there was no restriction on the ammount of terms a President can serve in office. If you want a good reason to join my minority view point, that Bill Clinton is a man to be respected and admired, read this book. If you dont want a reason, read it anyway. Its fucking hilarious.

       Crossballs  is the newest gem to come from the brilliant minds at Comedy Central. The concept is, for those of you who are unaware, the network sets up a real expert (without a clue that the show is fake) with a comedian and have them debate an issue. Its priceless for anyone who ever watches  Hannity and Colmes ,  Crossfire , or  Hardball   and I highly recommend it. Quote from the second episode, dealing with the legalization of Marijuana: "Name one Role model in America who has not gotten high once!"- Comedian "President Bush."- Expert, after a few minutes of thought and cagoling "Thank you for proving my point." Classic.  I noticed something the other day when John Kerry announced John Edwards as his running mate.  In the background, "Johnny B. Good" was blasting from speakers. That has to be the lamest joke i have ever heard in my life and i love the Democrats for it.  Speaking of Catholic boys, we'll get to the Profile of the day.  The ninth greatest character in Comic Book history:   Matt Murdock AKA Daredevil      Matt is the personification of whats commonly referred to as "Catholic Guilt". In Matt's mind everything in the world is his responsibility. He needs to fix it, or he hasnt tried hard enough. The desire to please his god and his father's memory drive him to do everything he can (and cant)do to change the ills of the world.     With little or no initiative Matt becomes his enemy. In donning the guise of the Devil, Matt seeks to absolve himself of the sins he commits during the night. My removing himself, at least superficially from the pain and the madness, Daredevil seeks to fight through the moral objections he has to what he does. Catholicism, at its heart, is based upon the thought that God forgives people for what they do, but your going to be going through alot of shit.     This angst is only added to by the fact that Matt's mother abandoned him and his father at a young age to become a Nun. While Matt didnt know where she went for a great many years    , the knowledge lead to a crisis of faith. Of all of the hero's in existance between DC and Marvel, Matt is most likely the unluckiest. His personal life is... lacking to say the least. All of his girl friends end up being evil or wind up dead. Electra dies. Karen Page dies. Typhoid Mary is a fucking lunatic. The Black Widow is a Soviet Assasin turned Avenger, so she comes with her own set of emotional baggage. All of these hectic personal ties, coupled with the Catholic Guilt, turn Daredevil into one of the most convoluted messes of a man in all of literature.    What makes him an amazing character is his ability to fight his war despite these pains. He fights through the guilt and the pain. He disregards the ravages of his faith and his concience to save the world from itself. When its all said and done, Matt Murdock is the definition of a Hero.

      Work keeps getting more and more tiring... unloading the truck today I couldn't help but notice that the majority of what we sell is complete and utter crap. The conveyor belt off of the truck just became an unending stream of tacky junk. O well, its a good way of getting paid.   Onward to the nerdity: Be aware, the fallowing character evaluation contains some heavy spoilers concerning the Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale Batman graphic novels  The Long Halloween  and  The Dark Victory . I would suggest that anyone intrested in reading one of the best Bat stories ever told, go and pick up a copy. It really does give you insight into the mind of Bruce, Harvey and Jim. (Wayne, Dent and Gordon, for those of you not on a first name basis with the characters yet.)    The tenth greatest character in Comic Book history:    Alberto Falcone      The Long Halloween  is an integral stepping stone in the devlopment of Batman's character. Basically a drawn out explination for the destruction of Harvey Dent and the birth of Two-Face, however, what the novel does most beutifully is create and flesh out the crime families of the DC universe. Specifically, it focuses on the family of Carmine "The Roman" Falcone. Carmine is essentially a play of Don Corleonne, but where the story becomes interesting is with his son, Alberto.   Alberto Falcone is a Harvard graduate. A student at Oxford. One of the most intelligent young men in the city. He also happens to be the son of Carmine Falcone, head of "The Roman Empire", a criminal syndicate that has a hand in corruption from Metropolis to Chicageo and rules Gotham with relative ease. Despite, or in fact because of, all of the above Alberto has remained out of the family business. Whenever the chance arose to enter the work of his father, Alberto was rejected because his father felt that his future lay elsewhere.   To say the least, Alberto never really accepted this point of view. He was deeply ashamed that his sister was closer to his father, and entrenched in the underworld while he was left to the colleges and intelligista therein. The love of a father is an amazingly powerful influence, and the lack thereof can drive men to do far worse things then what Alberto had decided to do.    Beginning with the murder of the Roman's nephew, Johnny Vitti, on Halloween a series of unexplained murders of the formost denizens of the underworld strike the heart of the Roman Empire. Theories abound as more and more mobsters are claimed by the Holiday murderer, until Alberto is fakes his death on New Years eve. This draws the attention away from Alberto and onto other  suspects, leading to the events that eventualy destroy Harvey Dent's fragile pshyci. Alberto, using this whole fiasco to his advantage, continues to kill the members of his father's inner circle and his enemies. Alberto is the perfect Yin to Batman's Yang.    Bruce was seperated form his father as a child through violence, crime and death. Alberto was  regulated to the sidelines and seperated defacto from his father as a child through violence, crime and death. Bruce vents this anger into the criminal element. Alberto funnels this anger back into his father, as a way of compensating for abandonedment as a child. Holiday is Alberto's way of destorying the barriers between himself and his father. Batman is Bruces equally vain attempt to reconcile himself of his father's attention.     When Holiday is captured fallowing his attempted hit on his father's rival, Sal "The Boss" Maroni, he is brought into the custody of the GCPD, Jim Gordan and Batman. A few hours later, Carmine arrives. Now, you have to understand one thing about Mobsters in the DC universe. There is a fine line between Organized Crime and the Metahuman (I agree, its a lame name for beings with phenominal powers, but DC spends millions of dollars a year on this stuff, so who am I to disagree.) Criminals that are regularly fought by the Bat. As thin as this line is, its is bold and red with blood. The Mob hates the concept that a group of freaks with flashy clothes and weird monikers can usurp their power. The Freaks are, quite often, insane, so it matters little to them. The knowledge that his son has become Holiday, one of the corrosions of what he holds to be the tenets of society, severly upsets and airs the deep rift between the father and son. In the end,behind the mass murder, the colorful clues, and the underlieing seething anger he hold for his father, Alberto truely is Poppa's little boy who mearly wishes his daddy would invite him along on his "missions."

      I skipped school today. I didnt do any of the homework, and I didnt feel like just showing up, taking the test and then leaving without turning in anything so I just stayed home, in theory to do my homework. Of coarse, because the nephew is over, I never got around to doing my homework before or after I had to head over to the High School for band practice. It went preety well, all things considered. Basically the section leaders learned what marching techniqes were going to be using with our new Marching Tech/Assistant Band Director/Brass Instructor/etc.., etc.., Dan Zillinger (Sorry, If I spelt that wrong...), then we sat down and went over some new pep tunes for next year.   Today we (meaning Me, because im single, bored and lonely) will begin to bring you a short character evaluation of Comic Book legends. The ten most complex, layered and well written characters in the medium. Everyday for the next ten days, Im going to go down the list and write between a paragraph and "Only god knows how long" on the particular character, in addition to my already riviting and moving moments of online goodness. The profiles begin tommorrow with our number ten character,my favorite gangster from any form of literature (Take that and cram it in your Cannoli, Don Corleone) Alberto Falcone, from the seminal, unappreciated Jeph Lobe/Tim Sale Batman peice, The Long Halloween.

      "The TX450! Celebrate the independence of your country by blowing up a small part of it!" - Random Beach Clerk from the Simpsons.  Fireworks are fun, especialy when coupled with amazingly good food. It just sucks that no one could make it. *Shrug* O Well. The family provided for more then enough entertainment and the baby nephew that showed up this morning didnt exactly hurt the matter any.

      Spiderman 2 was a good deal better then a I thought it would be. Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock very well, and brings out a human quality in the character that I feared would be absent from the film. Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst, while still not the ideal choices, are becoming increasingly comfortable with their roles. It sets up the third movie quite nicely, although I completely hated the way the thing ended. It was just so... Anticlimactic.    Im sorry. I didnt mean to pry. I hope you dont stay mad at me.

      My papa recently purchased the Universal Monster Legacy Collection. Its this giant box set with every Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolfman movie that Universal made during the golden age. Some of the movies, like each of the respective originals, are classics and phenominal  peices of cinema. Someof the movies are.... lacking. None the less, they serve for hours of entertainment and more than one cheap laugh.

      I know this is extremely short notice, so i'm not expecting anyone to really respond in the affirmative, but since i'm leaving for Washington tomorrow night, I was wondering if anyone would like to go to lunch and wish me a farewell before I have to get to LAX at 10. If you can, drop me a line between now and 3:00 tomorrow.  In case I dont see you, have a pleasant week and a half. I know I will.
