      This be a formal complaint to da brotha Brett Johnsaton fa lettin that woman up at the front desk be all provocative and showin her babylons and what not up in the main lobby.  I was thoroughly offended by her presumptious manner, especially in light of current social staus, what with people bein all filing dem massive harrassment complaints in da workplace.  Let me be at peace when I come to get my edjamucation on without bein taunted by risque threadding on the female species, life is already hard enough with girls gone wild commercials and howard stern and martha stewart.  Can't restrain from jizzin all ova da employees threat regions, can I?  Should I be endin up in the confines of a brightly lit, cold cage, whom should I hold responsible for the behavior which I commenced thereforth?  Emotional eruption occurs and men have a fragile libido when it comes to dem kindsa tings.  Don't say I didn't warn you.     -The previous was inspired by an actual complaint to Christy by Brett, aparently for the length of her visible waistline.

      "having the ability or power to create."  That over-simplified dictionary definition of the word 'creativity' doesn't quite encompass the essence of originality and deep expressiveness of the word when applied to authentic artists.  People merely "create" all the time.  I know a girl who writes what she calls "poems" about  rugs and swimwear that are ten words long and I would hardly call her "creative."  My step-dad used to make wooden birdhouses and household utility objects and I would also not label him a "creative."  Yes, indeed, they did "create" something, However creative merit, I believe, should be judged by depth of human understanding and the ability to communicate beauty and emotion in a particular artistic endeavor.  Yes, poems do consist of simple things like rugs and swimwear but there is something about the project that makes us marvel at that persons perception of those things or the spiritual revelation of, or perhaps disgust at those things along with their ability to interest us in why they are what they are and how they arrived at such an understanding.  The manner in which the art is presented.  Poems can also be quite simple in structure but the choice of words have such an impact that makes one recognize the true creative genius of what they have compiled.  It may be a simple brush stroke on a canvas and it may be the effortless placement of an object, but the interpreter needs some sort of personal fulfillment from that arrangement.  Some aspect of the product "moves" them.  It is a gift.  It cannot be taught.  (except at the circus)  It cannot be bought, although many artists experience capital gain from the distribution of their own creativity.   But that creativity will never be a tangible existence which can be transferred from one person to another, except through genetics.  Oh how I wish it were easier, I would have all the Cee-lo Greens copulate with the Eryka Badus havin little Tarantino and Scorcese babies rubbing on their Alan Balls.  But in a world where everyone was truly blessed with the gift, much like everything of any value, would we really be able to appreciate it or even distinguish it?  As far as my own creativity, I'm obviously unable to properly interpret, although I'm told my collage of the pillsbury dough boy is really "neat."  Limitations include the inability to transcend overtly sexual, violent, disgusting or in some way inappropriate references and imagery.  The hope is that through experience with greater minds, I will be able to one day see the world in a more universal format and have the opportunity to reach people via song, film or print.  The impact of others creativity on me is incomprehensable.  I literally owe my life to a number of musical talents, having had their songs pull me through unbearable moments and for providing the inspiration and confidence to save some of the minor successes I've been fortunate enough to keep.  Doubt anyone feels that way about my stepdads birdhouse.

      "It is ony after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."    -Like that person who made life seem worth living, who brightened every day for years until a blow-by-blow confession of horrendus sexual depictions and disloyal procedure sends shooting pain throughout your body and sinks the life- pumping-organ into shock and depraved convulsions.   Like the people who battled with you everyday and accompanied you through your most elating and disgusting experiences killing themselves, overdosing, being murdered or simply becoming so vulturous that mere contact is intolerable.   Or quite possibly the comfort found in a mothers touch through years of suffering, vomiting and torterous hospitalizations becoming suddenly distant until it is nonexistant and you only have the nervous twich and the screaming vocal punishments of a substitute to ease the pain.  Perhaps it is the dependance upon chemical numbness which has so lengthily created a tolerable existence becoming obsolete and over-destructive.  Maybe after the delusional dreams of youth which permeate every realistic endeavor are finally realized to be absurd.  Or every home-away -from-home, custom made to escape the realm of negative perception, fades into a wasteland of hatred and stupidity.   When institiutions no longer, protect or incarcerate or manufacture a sense or normality.   It is only after the loss of those, among many other things, that I am free to do anything.  Free to encompass myself with talented, well-directed people.  Free to run.  Free to quit school and join the circus.  Free to dance and sing and so many of the things that others are limited from by fear, embarrassment or material constraint.  Free to appreciate the last years of the family I have left.   Free to, one day, really connect with a woman in a spiritual manner and discover the euphoria of unity.  It is only with a feeling of complete hopelessness that divine possibility unfolds for me every second.  When comfort is not an option the only way is up and  I live every day like it's my mutherfuckin last one.   So many analyze and bitch about the most trivial of problems so frequently that nausea deepens in me.  It's time to go back to our roots.  Technology and distraction have robbed us of our right to experience more primal interactions.  If Tyler durden had not blown up his condo he would've never attained enlightment.  The purpose was to become life, not the perpetual search for materialism.  While at present, material posessions are abound, they are and have always been an unnessary stimulus for the soul.  Given the depletion of necessary nourishment which grants a human to flourish,  physical luxuries are frequently disposed of and or ignored.  "It is only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything" is just one of the "Durdenisms" that become very inspiring after everything goes wrong or circumstances are unbearable.  "You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else, all part of the same compost heap."  That is another universal truth that puts into perspective the utter predictability and irrelevance of the universe.  Quite often when nirvana isn't acheived, it is useful to discover peace in fatality.  "Stop being perfect and let the chips just fall where they may."  "You are not your job.  You are not how much money you have in the bank.  You are not the car you drive.  You are not the contents of your wallet... You're not your fuckin khakis."  How incredibly those obvious facts facilitate the true essence of life.    But that's just Tylers view.  Thats what you use as an after effect.  When you are about to engage a situation, no matter what the circumstance, Tony Montana is the source of inspiration with which best to enter.   "Me, I want whats coming to me... the world, chico... and everything in it."  Especially considering the context of the character: broke, bottom rung criminal refugee with no education, freshly shipped to the United States, with nothing to look foreward to but death or incarcaration, one can gain an incredible sense of empowerment from Scarface.   "First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the woman."  -a formal plan for success.  "I bury those cock-a-roaches!"  -as far as mantras go, it's about as good as you can get for aggressive and optimistic positive affirmation.  "I eat that fucka for breakfast.. shut that fucka down."  -also attains the desired effect.  "Wanna go to war!?"  quite frequently amps the adrenaline to an appropriate level so that maximum performance is achieved for a job, school, courtship, feud, fight, or any endeavor.  Although not verballed by Tony, this statement was made to him as he was losing touch with his own philosphy:  "Every day above ground is a good day."  -cannot be reiterated enough, we only get ONE shot at this so lighten the fuck up and cherish every minute.

      reality show concept:  People live together much like the real world, but cameras are strategically placed literally everywhere, even the tiniest corners so that the most private of moments are recorded in detail.  For an infraction in the household, a meeting is held and participants vote which embarrassing recorded moments are to be aired on television.  Much like being voted off the island in survivor, characters must endure public scrutiny from their fans, so that the prettiest girl will watch the public watching her wipe the excrement from her rectum and be forced to listen to the comments of every viewer who chooses to call in.  No more private sex, bathing, masturbation, urination, defecation, or grooming  This will be the first authentic reality telivision experience.

      he grabs me. not just a regula grab but a lustful one that signifies he really wants me in that way thats unhealthy but so completely and utterly satisfying he can't think of anything else. i can tell he's been waiting a long time for this. going through the motions in his mind. picturing every little detail of the ritual. making sure no one was looking. i wonder if anyone does know about our little secret. if they did they'd probably think of him differently. probably judge him. he doesn't want that. i know what he wants. he wants me to make him feel better about life. he wants that oh so temporary but oh so heavenly pleasure that makes him want to erupt in orgasm. i give him peace. he thrusts me from my resting position and slams me back and forth into him which causes me to release. he gets what he wants. then, like always, he finishes and leaves me wherever he found me until the next time he needs it. most of the time he passes right out. why can't more men be like him? the guy doesn't waste any time trying to butter me up he just gets right down to dirty business. doesn't try to sweet talk me or anything even remotely superficial. but i know he loves me. i can feel it. i can feel it every time he slaps that hand on my backside and pounds me into him, making me give it up again. i always do. and i always will. forever.

      Chris Rock is by far the best person to deligate the future of our country.  For one, he's black which just must happen.  He already said there will never be a black vice president because someone would immediately assassinate the president.  "I couldn't wait to kill the president!"  I believe were his exact words.   My kinda guy.  In response to the consequences, he said "What are you gonna do, send me to jail where I'll be a hero for the rest of my life!?"  "Probly get pardoned by the black president!"  Secondly, he's the most competent of anyone we've ever had in office and his vision of the world is clear and without corruption.  He is well aware of the hypocracy in America and has a plan for change.  Drugs that kill motherfuckers every day are legal if white people make the money.  Can't deny that.  Everybody in politics wants to be down with a gang.  Before they've heard the issue.  That's why I've never been able to be republican or democrat.  That is why I will trust president Rock.  He actually thinks!  What a concept.  "Some things I'm conservative about, some things I'm liberal about...  crime- I'm conservative, prostitution- I'm liberal."  -Sounds like a form of government we've never had the opportunity to experience before.  He even played the president in a movie, Head of state, which should be acceptable since just being an actor qualifies people nowdays, even if they just shot a lot of guns in their films.  If you watch Head of State, you will find many halarious but obvious solutions to enormous problems in America.  If not, you will at least be able to see a man who has the right type of mind to make unselfish decisions and make the world a more just place.  "Rock" the vote.      (If not, Bill Maher is second, followed by Dennis Miller, Michael Moore and George Carlin.)

      In the event of my demise, don't cry I wasn't meant to... etc. etc. etc.  No, if I perish I want my father to receive all my excrement from the past several years delivered in a pink box with a bow.  I want my mother delivered a telegram accompanied by a lawyer and a team of singing circus performers which will be a highly important looking envelope contaning air.  My grandparents will receive all my funds and posessions worth any monetary or sentimental value, my undying love, an airhorn which doesn't ever stop blaring and a perscription for morphine.  My grandfather will get my 9 millimeter pistol with enclosed intructions on the proper way to dispose of a body if he finds necessary.  To Jeanette Tomlinson, I leave an unsigned subscription to secradate, a service which will eventually captivate the heart of whomever you wish, humiliate them and transmit HIV to their entire family.  Angelina Jolie gets my soul which the devil is under contract to deliver at the moment they pronounce my expiration.  Anyone who got left off the list is a bastard and I hope to see you in the afterlife.

      Rectumali is a game that inmates play during longs bids in prison, usually for murder, robbery or drug posession.  Contraband, such as a baggie of heroin is injested by an inmate and passed, cleaned and reinserted into another inmate.  That is how the "ball is passed."  Teams are divided on each side of the living quarters.  The baggie must pass through every one on the tier.  Referees are designated to watch the insertion of every bag when it is placed into an oriface and again when it comes out to ensure no one is cheating.  The time limit for each team is half a day for each player.  Whatever means necessary to move the object as quickly as possible through one person to the next is permitted, so long as the judge agrees it actually went through.  If a person on your side of the tier refuses to play it will count against you.  The next cell will not be able to pass the ball until the refusing prisoner passes the contraband through their intestines.  One can see what interesting dramatic circumstances will insue if refusal is abundant.  The main rule is: "Pass the ball. Don't get caught.".  If a guard or member of the prison faculty becomes aware of the game you are automatically disqualified.  All paid guards must be registered with the judges before the game commences.  Winner gets an extra serving of Jello.

      The ability to clone and develop a conduit between other peoples minds had always been a strong desire for me.  In an ideal universe we would be able to come in physical contact with another individual and connect with their mental process and ever after posess the ability to learn from thier previous mistakes and become inspired by their experiences.  Creative endeavors would be expanded when the perspective of other people could be drawn upon and an entirely different view of the world captured.  One could, therefore, consult with any previous relationship from the past, even if they were on the other side of the world.  The idea seems reasonable to me because I believe we are all one consciousness experienceing itself subjectively and in the end we all come back to our original united soul.   Perhaps there is a reason we are unable to feel each others minds and we must have an independant  life process, but thus far, it's impossible to tell what that may be.  Perhaps a cosmic accident but perhaps when we do return to our original consciousness we will be enlightened in a way that allows for an infinitesimal empathy, considering we already did it all without each other at one time.

      You don't tell people about the way you remember them.  Not if you want them to feel comfortable. Like if I told Shauna that I rememembered her  by vomiting.  But it really is what I think.  I picture her bent over the toilet "wpurlackin-ack-ackgghjgging"away  every time I want to  remember her name. The reason why is because when we met it was at church and her friend was blowing big chunks in the lavatorium and I couldn't  think of any other way.  I knew I didn't ever wanna see her friend again but I definetely wanted to see her so I visualized the actions. It worked.  I always remembered her name.  It helped even more that I said "shauna vomita" like fifteen times while I stared at her.  That always works.  like stasha "place-ta" cause I just pictured her with her own private condo where she could have a "place to" do da damn thang you know?  so I can see her justa boincin up and down, Stasha.  It's wierd that pronunciation, shoulda been Stasha in which case I would've said "stasha  washa"  Justa washin her draws, you know?  Mine is relatively easy if you read anything I write.   Believe it or not, my ex girlfriend, I actually remembered cause her name was Rebekah Rember.  How can you not 'rember Rember?  Andy candy ;). Nick the prick ;).  But you know my all time favorite?  Heddy.  Remember the cute little bear, "teddi ruxpin?'  Well that didn't work.  But I remembered what we used to say when we'd ask a woman for oral bliss.  It was either "How 'bout heddy pendengrass?"  or "Can I get some heddy ruxpin?" ;)  And if she says "no" then that's a "no-brainer."  And while it's always a plus to discover a female that is talented when she GIVES you brain, it's absolutely divine to unearth one that HAS a brain.  At least that's the way I have it in MY brain.  I haven't been with one yet.  But her name should be "plains."                                                     "It's Dick!  ...and yes, it's me."                                                  -Richard, The Rules of Attraction   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Whomever is responsible for the blog, I’m assuming not Ms. Eaton, is quite possibly the most disturbed journalist we have amongst us, or at least that’s the way it appears.  If there is a more troubled individual on the list, their angst-ridden soul is only visible through their comments about others and their environment.  This person, posting themselves as “Ryan,” quite eloquently expresses the darkest and most pessimistic of thoughts, by using simplicity as a most effective force.  Posts such as “jesus h fucking christ life is hell” quite significantly purvey a deep understating of harsh reality.  If one is able to relate to such a statement, admiration for their straightforward nature immediately resides.  That is the only comment for the entire entry at 10:28 PM.  The next jewel of wisdom bestowed upon us occurs at 6:41 PM and is impossible for the same Wednesday according to the Gregorian calender system, which would lead one to believe that we cannot trust our author, at least not for accurate data entry.  Emotional content, perhaps, is another story.  It appears this person was forced to write a blog even if they had nothing to say.  Even in such a vacuous environment, the inner person seems to reveal itself.  Self exposure was probably assisted by the forced entry, much like a Rorschach test.  For instance, “ihateyaihateyaihateyaihateyaihateyaihateya”  does a magnificent job of communicating frustration.  Other entries, such as “I have nothing to say.  I have so little to say.  So I won’t say what I have left to say.  Which is really close to nothing.  So you see nothing.  Which is all I have to say.”  reveal the hopeless nature of the individual while simultaneously divulging a clever mentality.   More impressive mental acuities become present as reading continues.  Philosophical questioning, pertaining to human existence and religion follow.  Talk of mass destruction and world termination would lead us to believe that, while pensive and intellectual, this person is quite depressed and pessimistic.  A most impressive analysis of American socio-political values concludes; “Life and liberty for everyone.  Of course the developed world doesn’t extend to the ghettos and black people.”   Overall I am impressed with this persons passion, as dark as it may be and ability to communicate bluntly.  I feel that if more time were spent, they would be able to expose a plethora of philosophical debate, however therapy may be needed.

      "Richie-Rich!" D hollered at me as he discovered me waiting for him for my weekly trip to get my haircut.  I go to the black barbershop because white people don't know the proper technique for giving a fade.  D always calls me "Richie-Rich because he thinks I'm rich.  Actually he knows I'm rich.  He has no other choice but to think so since I'm always well-groomed, fresh and clean.  Also we've discussed my current situation and he is aware I don't pay bills.  He prompts a response, "so whats it feel like to be so rich, Richie-Rich?"  I can feel tension in the air.  "Bills, bills, bills," he always says and I can picture what it feels like to service a white "rich kid"  with no worries every week or at least watch my casual demeanor when I sit and talk with my usual barber, Rob.   I said "it feels like shit."  He laughs and calls me modest, then explaining how I can trust him to tell what it feels like to be so rich.  "Money ain't everything baby" I say.  He replies, "oh yeah but you got it good, I can see you got it good, man I wonder what it feels like, no worries, no bills, no kids to take care of."  "Materialisticlly I'm okay at present but I bet it's a lot of times I'd rather be in your shoes, you just can't tell.  I look comfortable?  Thas good man.  Thats the desired effect."  He says, "Oh yeah- real comfortable man, you got the Mercedes and the big crib and all that man, no worries.  Parents gon probly give you a jaguar, like "here son go drive."  I said "but I bet you got a family that gives you emotional comfort and you got people you can depend on though right, brother?  You ever wanted to kill yourself?"  It went on like this, him trying to prove how much better I had it and me trying to give him somewhat of a glimpse into my reality, underneath the image.  We compared stories of jail, family abuse, depression, loss and death the entire time he was working on my head.  He might have me beat in that last department since his mother was murdered during a robbery, but I had to point out that at least he knew his mother would be there for him if she was alive, where as mine chose to vanish from my life long ago and we barely stay in contact.  The lesson is that I should be grateful for what I have, because there are many who would love to be in my position, however I must wonder if they would go back to their previous lifestyle if they could experience mine.  Or vice versa.  I continued to meditate on the subject as it was obvious D never quite understood the other side of the cards I've been dealt and the point was reinforced, almost like divine intervention as soon as I left and crossed the street on the way to the five points Marta station.  A beggar in a wheelchair took one look at me and moved right in front of my path, blocking the sidewalk so foreward momentum was immediately halted.  "What a dick?"... "I need to give him money?"... "I need to change my life?"  What was the message here?  Two incredibly prominent encounters pertaining so greatly to the fact I appear to have it well off must mean something.  Not every white person who travels along decatur street in downtown Atlanta gets the same reaction.  I've been walking back and forth on that street every day for five years and getting a fade at Raw Cuts for three.  Dress the way I feel?  Feel the way I look?  The questions never stopped coming and I feel an immense drive to divulge the emotions to the world.  The best means to communicate the poetry is thorugh my one true love, Hip-Hop.  A black mans game.  A game many don't want me in.  An endeavor where the tables are turned and the caucasian is the minority.  Like American status, we are looking for our own civil rights movement within the realm of music.  If my mic is low on stage and no one can decipher the message then I just look like another cracker who thinks he can rap.  Even if they can understand many turn a deaf ear simply based on principle.  Talent remains unrecognized.  Meanwhile, the same recycled marketing schemes, shallow gimmicks and negative content remains at the top of the Hip-Hop charts with a serious void of intellectual and emotional inspiration.  The opportunities I've been afforded due to my color aren't without an equal and opposite reaction.  Learning disabilites, personal demons and unfortunate circumstances continuously contaminate school, employment and relationships.  So I start at the bottom, always looking on top and feeling like the worst of the best is yet to come.   "time is dead and I need a beat where the divine is bred and I'm hittin the street it would seem that with the discman i'm just ignoring but the truth is that this damn world is just boring elders say I'm makin my perception restricted but you don't ever see a fuckin stride like this, kid sprung from that state of mind thats been invicted focused on the moment with eyes depicted when that theme drops it freeze blocks  perceive clocks in complete knots the beat knocks to all my studio gods: recieve props how else could I make it from five points to GSU slide into the sequel of a decade like PS2 and bring my visions with me nightmares with precision, swiftly but thats covered in the song- bounce to it can't cope if emotion don't announce to it feel my pain and my loss when it rains what it cost  but see if I'm side tracked  I'm skippin through life tracks yeah I notice that glance at me like "damn he's so care free" I wish you knew everything and where I wish I could be but I'm there as long as the beat don't lose power you can stare, I don't care if the street don't cower good till i'm gone, chico I never let the street go extinguish me early and observe how well the streak go the star that burned out but ya still see next week though say my battery's low I'll let my flattery show full blast my favorite track until the beats go then I'll be with my idols, all of em fouled ya screw back in the lightbulbs and feel the nostalgia your battery's cool but can you see my vision? when my fuel runs out I'll be reminescent  how'd ya miss it? a large fable- I won't rot- face it  they're rechargeable and I got replacements"                                                 -Invictus  2001

      Dirt.  Dust.  Sweat..  "Mbwa-dach-teret-dach"  and my personal digital assistant, hi-8 camcorder, cellular phone, clean white air force ones, dry-cleaned shirt and caucasian entourage.  They played the song they play when a king arrives.  We were just a news crew, but they thought what we were doing was deserving of royal treatment.  We were giving credibility to their medical technique.  Though stationed in an uncomfortably small hut and surrounded by grime, these people had successfully figured out how to treat the AIDS virus.  This was worthy of flying across the world, being subjected to discomfort, harrassed and assaulted by the natives and traveling long and bumpily through the worst heat known to man and finally arriving in the village of fatik.  I, carrying a tripod through the sandy walk across the village, could feel the astonishing eyes of men, women and children gazing at me with more intensity than I'd ever felt, even on stage.   The first white people they had ever seen unloaded advanced recording equipment from a van and began to document their lives.  They studied us as we studied them, probably with more curiosity, since we had all seen people like this on television, but they had never seen anything like us.  What a remarkable circumstance that such drastically different forms of evolution were taking place on the same planet.  Us, with our digital revolution and them, with their spitritual practices.  Who was I to be so deserving of fresh, clean comfort in the United States while these people transported nourishment from the only water source, miles away from home, upon thier heads?  Immediate guilt ensued.  Never stepping out of the spotlight and in a constant state of awe, I began to shrink front of these most basic, simplistic humans.  Walking around, as we do in this country, even in the most poverty striken of areas, cannot compare to the feeling one encounters in the midst of those in Fatik.  But perhaps my entire dishonor about being a "priveleged" American was false.  Perhaps these people were completely satisfied with their way of life and felt sorry for us, being so entrenched in a materialistic world, and it was arrogant to assume that everyone else on the other side of the globe wants to be like us.  Either way, I discovered the most enchanting reletionship I'd ever experienced with the young Abladoof, a little boy who took a serious liking to my personal video camera.  Against better judgment I let him touch buttons, aim and point the camera at everything he wanted.  He behaved remerkably well and treated my equipment with utmost care.  His friends exitedly gathered as the little boy and I bonded, in spite of our language barrier, for several minutes, completely flabberghasted that I chose him over the others.  He was just too cute.  I never saw such a glowing energy of life as in the eyes of young Abladoof.  He calmly followed me around everywhere for the entire day.  So in the place most different than any I would ever enounter, and where the people couldn't be more opposite, I discovered the most memorable relationship to date.   Unfortunately it came time to bid farewell to the boy with whom I had grown so fond.  I gave him all the francs I had and some candy that I made him eat in front of me so I wouldn't be attacked by the other children.  He waved frantically as we exited the premisis with our footage and I thought of how I was taking away something far more profound than the story we were there to document.  When I graduate to a digital camera, I want to send my 8 millimeter to Fatik addressed to Abladoof.  I've been instructed that it would only create a destructive situation for the boy considering the jealous nature of human beings.  Either way I will always remember my little man in that dusty village where they cure AIDS.

      The zippo product was actually chosen because the attraction to Victoria Secret was too obvious.  It just seemed too much like me, so I opted for something more challenging since opportunities for sexual depiction will probably be abundant.  I then realized how much of a challenge I was facing.  Zippo is a product that has been around for sometime.  It's very difficult to introduce a new interest in the product because of it's familiarity.  It only has one basic use, to ignite flame and isn't quite popular compared to shitty, plastic lighters.  The challenge would be to remind people who are familiar with zippo lighters just why they are useful and worth the money.  I instantly saw a benifit which could be solutioned visually.  The durability and masculine association with the product could be exploited in a variety of ways.  Personify the product and depict various situations which call for a harder, more dominant type of person and the desired effect will be attained.  That proved to be an unacceptable approach.  Now faced with the same delimma, obvious, in-your-face visuals of the lighter in comparison to things of lesser value or merely displaying grandiose aspects of the lighter seemed to be appropriate.  Those proved to be oversimplified and uninformative.  Now for a third approach, I find myself looking for verbal seducers for an everyday object.  I've described "fire" in every way imaginable and am searching for an appealing way to attach the terminology to a visual.  When this marriage is discovered, certain flourishment shall ensue.  Thank you for your concern.

      evan struck me as an immature teenager, probably sixteen or seventeen years old with quite a bit of nervous habits, including chewing his lip, tapping any part of his body, twitching various parts and some strange rolling maneuver with his thumb and forefinger.  He seems to think quite a bit of himself and I wonder if his head will explode from ego.  I was immediately dissuaded by his uncontrollable mouth.  He's almost cute but blurts the most inappropriate phrases and comebacks ever known to man at the worst possible times and doesn't seem to have any regard for anyones feelings.  even his own.  He will casually remark about his own self destructive nature as if there were no choice in the matter.  If he's not doing that he's making some overt sexual remark, intended either to humor or attract, I don't have the slightest inkling, but neither works for me.   Forced to spend more time than I would've liked with him, proved to be a revelation.  He is in fact, 24, quite a bit older than I would've ever guessed, especially considering his vulgar, immature sense of humor and juvenile style.  He has quite a bit of rationale for his choice of attire and youthful appearance.  He explained that Hip Hop culture has been such an emmense part of his life that he will always be inclined to represent the aspects of the movement in some form.  His choice for early ingestion of intoxicants and genetic disposition serve as a possible explanation for his appearance.  Or, he says, just "luck."  "It helps me justify playing like a kid", an activity without, he reveals, may find life intolerable.  As he explains his circumstance, his eyes become intense and sad and I can see the pain beneath his cavalier demeanor.  He was encompassed by negative people from an early age and exposed to quite a bit of unpredictable and dangerous predicaments.  Most of the people with whom he learned to associate were very blunt, abrasive individuals.  It is that for which he attributes his innappropriate vocal nature and social challenges.   Although self sought, he accepts responsibility for many of his skewed beliefs and actions.   He expresses a desire to be more "normal."  He starves for female attention and is very lonely since his mothers departure during his teenage years.  Near death experiences, years of abandonment, abuse, social disfunctionality, depression and self-hatred, have left him open to new experience and a serious lust for a gratifying life.  He is also a manic depressive with extreme paranoia.  After listening to the details of many misfortunes, I'm amazed that he's able to cope as well as he is with such an enthusiastic attitude, the only noticable after-effects being some nervous twitches and occassional slip of the tongue.  I feel sorry for him and have an urge to hold him and take care of him unless he slips back into his normal motus operandi.  His ability to articulate and analyze is profound and I can hardly believe he is the same man whom I thought so lowly of at first meeting.             - what Brooke told me

      Nothing of any real necessity will be found at this location.  The price of everything is in the name on the front of the building.  They appear to have everything but they have nothing.  They are all over the place.  Toilet articles, knick- knacks, childrens toys, food products, works of art and containers are just some of the products available, but you probably don't want any of them.  Somehow they manage to stay in business.

      The burning emotion that fuels a passionate romance or the devistating monster which destroys a home, the horrid pain that shoots through your genitalia from a sexually transmitted desease, the relief of satisfying an addiction for a long awaited smoking agent and the necessary ingredient with which to keep the body at a liveable temperature or to make food edible.  The natural chemical reaction which makes life possible.   One fourth of the elements which represent all natural activity.  It runs your car, your house, a factory, the planet earth.  It explodes from the earths core as the most powerful energy known to humankind.  It mutates the body and inflicts great pain.  It is an insturment of torture used to control and punish.  It is encountered by people everyday.  Children are protected from it and taught it's dangers and it's benifits.  It is a horrible demon that extinguishes life and simultaneously provides nourishment for life to be possible.  It can be enormous or portable, beautiful and hideous.  It is an emotion, a sensation, an action, a noun, a descriptive, an insturment, a revelation and a dread.  Battles have been fought with it, wars have been weakened by it and patnerships started with it.  It provides employment and serves as entertainment.  Some have a compulsion to let it breathe and stare into it's emmensely captivating aura.  Some must inflict it's path of destruction on others and some need it as a necesary stimulant to themselves for sexual gratification.  It is orange. blue, violet, black, red, green and can grow at alarming speeds.  Some spend their entire lives dedicated to studying it's behavior.  It can be tracked from point of origin and it's entire life mapped out, course by course, until a biography is constructed.  It is reinacted, simulated and examined for clarity.  It can die as soon as it is birthed.  It's remains can provide evidence for the incarceration or legal ramifications of an individual in a case.  It is an infinitesimal force which will, most likely, live long after every human being has perished.  It is a symbol of divine worship and can serve as proof that no higher being exists.  We cannot live without it.  It is the universe.                                                                                     -BEAVIS
