      Sometimes we all get caught up in celebrities lives and watch an extraordinary amount of television.  I’d have to say one of my idols was Michael Jordan.  I love playing basketball and growing up watching Mike was just an awesome experience.  He was basketball to me.  But looking at it closer, who actually taught you things ?  Who bought you that basketball hoop ?  Who was there to teach you all the important lessons in life ?  Michael Jordan ?  My real idol was my dad.  He isn’t really the type to sit down with you and give advice and talk to you about things, very often.  He leads by example.  He’s a loving and devoted husband and father.  He would sacrifice anything for his wife and his children.  Sure, on occasion he can be strict, just like any parent, but what parent isn’t ?  It’s kinda weird because usually a son picks up on some of the skills a father has.  But in this case, not really.  He’s an expert on car maintenance and I have no idea why my engine light keeps flashing.  He’s real handy around the house and I can’t even figure out what the hell is growing under my stove.  Being on my own for 2 and half years, I would have loved to have some of the skills he possesses.  I know this may sound a little clichéd but it is for sure true.  If, someday, I get married and have kids, if I can even amount to being half the man he is, I know my wife and kids would be the happiest and luckiest families in the world.  So on this Father’s day weekend, happy father’s day to my dad and all the other great dads out there.

      In a series that was totally dominated the team that was supposed to dominate, the Pistons took it in 5.  Way to go.  I do give congrats to the Lakers as well for making the final, but it is really refreshing to have a team like the Pistons win.  No superstars; no Jordan, no Duncan, no Shaq or Kobe.  Just a bunch of throwbacks.  There was no clear cut MVP.  Maybe Ben Wallace or Rasheed Wallace, or Chauncy Billups (who actually won) deserved MVP honors.  And even Joe D’s name popped up too.  Maybe I should have won MVP because of my excessive yelling at Devean George and Derek Fisher to go sit back down on the bench (obviously yelling at my TV - “you ain’t got nothing, go sit down !”).  The fact of the matter was that it was a different guy every night that stepped up.  Al Michaels and Doc Rivers (boy, I really do miss the NBA on NBC with Marv and the Czar), repeatedly said that the MVP should go to the entire team.  I totally agree, but to me the MVP trophy for the team is the Larry O’Brien trophy.  My only issue is that the Pistons could have, no, should have swept LA.  In essence, I believe they did.  Congrats to the Pistons, those blue collar, tough-nosed, hard-working, un-Hollywood like players.   They deserve it.

      After missing the entire game, due to the fact that I myself was busy playing basketball, I arrived back at my place at approx. 11:15 p.m.  I waited for the NBA Finals highlights of game 3 between Detroit and LA.  TSN had golf and The Score had Smackdown.  The only other station was Rogers Sportsnet that was actually broadcasting their nightly sports news report.  After, what seemed like hours and hours of baseball, hockey, baseball, hockey, and hockey reports, they finally had shown the Game 3 basketball highlights.    If I had blinked, I would have missed those highlights.  Now, I like Canada just as much as the next guy, but the NHL Awards, the Montreal Expos and The Schick man Colby Donaldson got more coverage on that channel than the NBA Finals.  I realize that this is a hockey dominated country, but believe it or not there are plenty of basketball fans out there, for some reason, no one's paying attention.  Thank God Toronto did not win the Stanley Cup, or else all of our favorite shows would have been pre-empted for endless interviews including Eddie Belfour's second cousin's college roomate's brother-in-law's gardner:  "So Guillermo, that was some Stanley Cup Final eh ?"  No actual game highlights were played on Sportsnet of Game 3.  They showed the score, and a quick clip of Shaquille O'Neal after the game, making one of those witty post-game comments.  (Even I got more coverage on A-Channel last weekend).  Whatever, Canadaian broadcasters.  You can have your highlights of the Junior Football League (CFL), hockey games in August, interviews of Scott Niedermeyer and Guillermo the gardner.  Just stop changing the Fox channel to friggin' Global every night.  I quite enjoy those quirky american commercials.

      If any of you happened to catch A-Channel news on Sunday night, there was about a 3 second clip of me at the Hoop-it-Up Tournament this past weekend.  Of all the clips, they had to show the one with the other team scoring....Boooo !!!

      Not many know this but...it all started in 1999.&nbsp; The very first Summer of Rob, which spawned many sequels thereafter and developed into a successful blockbuster series.&nbsp;   Premise - Back in '99 Rob was in the midst of a developing a career at a call centre and nearing the end of&nbsp;a very lengthy University tenure.&nbsp; SOR started in May with a road trip to Alberta.&nbsp; I'll never forget the time I checked my&nbsp;jacket at The OZ in West Ed. and the gazed upon the most extraordinary "coat rack" ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;It could have held 2 very heavy winter coats.&nbsp; (Hi Carla, if you're reading this).&nbsp;  Most memorable scene in SOR:&nbsp; The hookup that screwed up.  SOR 2: The Beginning (doesn't mean this is&nbsp;a prequel) Premise- 2000.&nbsp; The beginning of the millenium.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, May was the starting point.&nbsp; A friends birthday party...there she was...pulled into the blackhole with no chance of escape.&nbsp; Has Rob escaped ?&nbsp; Not yet.&nbsp; But, oh has he tried.&nbsp;  Most memorable moment:&nbsp; I guess its pretty obvious.  SOR 3: Trilogy, schmilogy Premise-New job.&nbsp; Same Rob.&nbsp; What a boring summer. Most memorable moment: The end of the summer.  SOR 4: The Bachelor Premise- Wow.&nbsp; 2 Weddings, means 2 bachelor parties.&nbsp; Rob gets involved in 2 bachelor parties and does his best to not embarass himself at both of these weddings.&nbsp; After&nbsp;one speech that lasted forever and the other talking about himself, Rob decides that drinking is really the only solution to anything in life. Most memorable moment:&nbsp; This movie had to cut some scenes in order to bring it down to an R rating.&nbsp; Wait for the uncut version on DVD.  SOR 5: Worst Summer Ever Premise - Rob learns that he is the creator of his own doing.&nbsp; He's dug a hole for himself so deep, that he cannot possibly get out of. Most memorable moment: If you know Rob, then you know.  SOR 6&nbsp;- To be continued...&nbsp;

      What might you ask is BIP ?  There are many uses for the word BIP. 1) BIP as a beverage - Remember Beep juice.  That stuff was awesome.   2) BIP as in food - If you work for Agriculture like I do then you have a good grasp of what BIP is.  There's been that BSE problem with BIP (you know, BIP Spoingiform Ensephalatory, or something like that).  The actual word is Beef.  But some pronounce it as BIP.  Especially where I come from. 3) BIP as a sound - When you honk your horn it goes "BIP".  What the hell am I talking about ?  Next topic please.  If any of you guys like fishing, I suggest MacArthur Falls.  Lots of big Pickerel with none of the hassel and disappointment of catching Catfish.  Mmmmm...Pickerel cheeks.  Also, I would like to check out Great falls.  S'pose to be good there 2.  Damn.  Finished 5th in Poker tonight.  Wasn't a good night.  I miss my friend Rhoden.  Where are you ?  Come back.  Just a warning.  If you try to cross the boarder with some Bip they might not let you.  It's been a while since I've been on this thing...oh well.  I feel like drinking tommorow night.  No BIP though, just some alcohol will do fine.
