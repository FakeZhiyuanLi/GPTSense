      I feel like have just blinked my eyes since the last time I wrote my first post, and yet my life has gone through the one of the biggest changes that has ever happened to me and single-handley, without a doubt, the worst thing that has ever happened in my life. In a little over an hour from now, it will have been a week since I left work, relieved to go home and eat dinner, only to arrive and find out my girlfriend who I had been dating for a year and a half, had been moving all her things out that day and was waiting there to tell me she was leaving me and that our life together was over. Needless to say, it was devastating and I am still in complete shock, with my mind trying to deny it. It's only the last day or two that I am fully realizing what has happened, and I have never felt the emotions I am feeling. I am currently at work and have been good and tried to remain strong and show up each day, although I have had to step out a few times and leave early, as I couldn't take it. I keep thinking about her all the time and wondering how this happened. Is she seeing someone else? She says no and I believe her, but I still wonder if there maybe someone she has feelings for and this has persuaded her to leave me and wait until she feels it is ok to date the new guy. After all that is essentially what she did for me. We had been friends in high school, although not good friends, and she always had a thing for me. In college we started emailing all the time and talking on the phone and then one day she finally left her boyfriend for me, as I told her I had feelings for her and we were making plans to go to Europe together albeit originally just as friends.  I am new to the blogging experience, and it seems a bit akward to write to no one, yet at the same time write for anyone. Who knows whether anyone will even read this, and knowing me I will never keep an active record of my life and feelings. But obviously this is such a detrimental, depressing, life-changing experience for me; I figure perhaps this will help me sort out my feelings and life.

      This office consumes me. It just sucks the life right out of me. Thank God it is almost 5 o'clock.   I am 23 years old and would already retire if I could. My power suits and Italian leather shoes are just not doing it for me.  I just want to be back in Europe. Forgive me for such a depressing inaugural post, I can be happier, I promise.
