       Well, its 2002.  So what have I learned this past year?  Several things:  1]  Be wary of highways.  Very wary. 2]  Always abandon the shitty job for the new job that kicks ass. 3]  Always work your ass off during quarter breaks.  Your bank account will appreciate it. 4]  Do not, under any circumstances, take 4 classes at one time.  For the sake of your sanity.   5]  You can not fit someone over 6 foot tall in your small Toyota Echo.  It doesn't work [sorry Jon]. 6]  Your small Toyota Echo is NOT a big badass red snow plow.  Well, thats about it.  Anything important that you learned this past year?  Feel free to share with me at  urlLink this E-mail addy .

       Im going home.  Home as in Florida.  I'm going to visit a friend from High School and have a great time in the sunshine state!  I'll be there for 5 days, and I've been psyched ever since I got my tickets!  I'm leaving December 30th and Coming back January 4th, so I'll be able to party with my pal Puff and her guy for New Years!  Kick ass!  God only knows I've needed a vacation, and this will do the trick.  5 days in the nice Orlando sunshine should help greatly in my battle against myself.

      You know, dad was right all those times when he told me that "life sure is funny."  One day I'm having the shittiest day on the planet, and then the next, I'm having a great day.  What the hell is going on?  Am I bi-polar or something?    Gah...

      Happy New Years people!  I'm having the best time here in Florida.  New Years was awesome.  We went to Downtown Disney to see fireworks.  Traffic was a bitch trying to get out of there, but other than that, it was great!  I'm having a blast at Puff's, and I got to see Kristin (the little freak!) and her brother Brad (mini ghetto thug), Meghan (exactly how many times are you gonna trade in your car and/or get a new cell phone?), Lena, Ben (great guy!  I'm very happy for Puff), and last but not least Robyn and Andrew (two extremely cool people I wish I got to know earlier).  It is unfortunate, but I didn't get to see Ana, Amanda, Meredith, or Carpenter.  Hopefully next time I'll see 'em all.  A funny thing happened on the way to the forum:  Kristin and I drove past Cypress Creek.  It was a very emotional moment for me, and I almost cried as we cruised through the parking lot.  I had some of the best times of my life at that school and with most of the people mentioned above (Puff, Kristin, and Ana I probably wouldn't have made it through High School without you.  Meghan and Amanda, thanks for keeping me "occupied" on the weekends!).  It's sad that it took a trip back home to Florida to make me realize how thankful I am for each and every one of my friends in Florida.  I owe you guys so much.  We've had good times, bad times, and ugly times.  In the end I want you all to know that I love all of you.  Thanks again for getting me through it all.   I miss you guys.

      For me, love is an experience that is quite foreign.  However, I do know the signs and symptoms of love, and it's much like the flu (I've learned this primarily from watching others suffer from it).  You catch it unknowingly (most of the time) and unwillingly (if you're a loner like me).    To make a short story long:  I'm sick and I know exactly who gave it to me.    You know who you are.

       I've been having a motivation issue lately.    I can't seem to motivate myself to get up for school in the morning or go to work.  I feel so guilty about it too.  What should I do?  Should I just try harder to roll out of bed in the morning?  Get more sleep?  Find something to wear me out so that I'll pass out earlier?  Damn.  I need some serious help here.

      Well I finally got around to redesigning the website.  I really like the new color scheme.  I hope this outlay is better than the old one.    The damn hospital has got me working freakin midnights (11 pm to 7 am) and I find myself having mixed emotions about it.  I dont mind working these hours, but I dont really like getting to sleep at 8 am in the morning.  The people I work with are cool. Thank god it's Spring Break....after I take my Physics final in a few hours.

      God, the end of this quarter is draggin.  Physics is soooo much better this time 'round, but physiology is kinda hard.  History is ok, kinda fun to be able to express your knowledge and opinions in discussion.  Fortunately, this quarter is over in a week.  The spring will bring more Physics, Hebrew 101, and a First Aid class my way.  It won't be so bad, because, some summer, I not going to OSU.  I'm talking a X-Ray class at Columbus State.    Fun.

      Its me again.  I know it's been a week since I wrote, but I haven't been feeling very inspired lately.  I need to write today to sort out my mind.  I worked some hella hours this weekend, which is great.  Not only is the money awesome, but I love everything I get to see and learn.  That and I just don't want to go home anymore.  Dad's being an asshole as usual, bitching at mom about everything.  Mom, as usual, is taking it in stride.  Why?  I don't know.  I wish she'd just divorce him already.  He expects so much from her when he doesn't do shit at all.  I feel sorry and guilty at the same time that my brothers go through this shit, because I'm rarely home anymore to point out and explain important things to them that my parents won't take the time to explain.  Sure, my brothers are bratty and annoying, but I love them and I love to be able to do things with and for them.  At this point, I give up on life.  My mind is twisting around in a million different directions and I don't know what to do anymore.  Sometimes, I wish I could be numb all the time so that I just wouldn't give a shit.  Sometimes I wish I had the money, time, and guts to go see a shrink.  Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive so I wouldn't have to deal with this apocolyptic bullshit.

      Hello again.    Where should I begin?  How about yesterday at work?  I got into numerous fights with Jonathan about anything and everything.  The boy always thinks he's right (and so do I, which is why we are like oil and water).  Don't get me wrong, he's a cool guy and a good friend, but my head pounds after working with him.  Other than that, work was cool.  It was eerily slow this weekend, except for some victims of the riots that occured on Saturday.  I got home from work around 11:15 and decided to organize my room.  I bought these great big plastic storage bins and some other devices that remind me of  urlLink Yaffa blocks .  I was up to all hours doing this organizing.  Am I suddenly becoming obsessive-compulsive?  I sure as hell hope not.  Well, I need to cut this short and get my ass to Hebrew class.  Talk to you later.

      Geez.  I think I had too much fun last night.  So much fun, in fact, I'm wondering if it was illegal.  Fire played a decent set, could have been better, but the singer's voice was going out.  The bassist (Anton), The guitarist (Aric), the drummer (Justin), and the keyboardist (Stacy) were awesome as usual.  They didn't play my fave song, but it's all good.  The aftershow activities were awesome, but I can't disclose anymore info than that.  Want to check em out?   urlLink Check em Out!

      Mirror mirror on the wall  Its been a while since I've posted at all.  Life is hectic as usual.  I'm a nervous wreck right now, awaiting to find out if I get into the program.  Work is decent, social life is decent.  Much emotional drama swirling around in my head, but I'll save that for your distant cousin, AKA the journal under my mattress.  Nothing much else to report, captain.

      Well, its 2:18 in the morning and I've been bound to this fucking computer all day.  Why?  Working on this fucking website.  Christ, I can't be normal and stay with one layout.  I have to constantly tinker with it, until I am appeased for the day.  What a tragedy.  Anyway, today wasn't half bad.  Got up at like 1:45 pm, went to Hebrew class, went out to dinner with my family, worked on this thing.  Got a Hebrew quiz tomorrow.  Cool.  By the way, what the hell happened to  urlLink Friday Five ?

Her baby's daddy is cool too.  We went to some park in Grove City, grilled hot dogs, played frisbee, and battled all kinds of bugs.  I'm meeting Peech for lunch tomorrow.  Looking forward to being able to party again once she pops out that baby in December.  Hell Yes.

      My  urlLink Friday Five    1. What's the last vivid dream that you remember having?   I don't really remember my dreams, so nothing really sticks in my mind.   2. Do you have any recurring dreams?   I used to when I was younger.  I would dream that I was falling down cliffs, buildings, etc.   3. What's the scariest nightmare you've ever had?   Dont remember.   4. Have you ever written your dreams down or considered it? Why or why not?   I would like to, but I would never remember them.  I take so long to actually wake up that this, sadly, is not an option.   5. Have you ever had a lucid dream? What did you do in it?   If I did, I didn't remember it.

      I have a serious impulse buying problem.    I had seen a guitar on sale that I really really wanted in  urlLink Musicians Friend magazine , and I was going to buy it when I got my tax return back.  After work today, I went to Sam Ash, which was having a sale, for the sole purpose of scoping out prices of the guitar I wanted.  Lo and behold, they had the exact same guitar I wanted.  And it was cheaper.  I bought the fucking thing.  A Squier Affinity Stratocaster, made by Fender.  Blue.  She's very beautiful.   urlLink This is what she looks like.   I need to come up with a name for her.  Suggestions?   UPDATE:  5/26/02  - I have named her Abby.

      I've decided to post some lyrics to some of my current favorite songs also.   "She Loves Me Not" - Papa Roach [LoveHateTragedy]   When I see her eyes look into my eyes Then I realize that she can see inside my head So I close my eyes thinking that I could hide Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head The situation, is to adjatation if she cut me off Would this be an amputation? Chorus: I don't know if I care I'm the jerk, life's not fair Fighting all the time This is out of line She loves me not, loves me not! Do you realize I won't compromise She loves me not, loves me not!  Over the past five years I have shed my tears I have drank my beers and watch my fingers fly away Then until this day you still swing my way But its sad to say sometimes she says she loves me not But I hesatate to tell her I hate This relationship I walked out tody this is over  (repeat) Chorus Life's Not Fair I'm the jerk!  Line for line, ryhme for ryhme Sometimes I be writin' all the goddam time It's makin' me sick Relationship is gettin' ill This your stupid man On the real, could you feel What I feel, what's the deal girl We're tearin' up each others world We should be in harmony boy and girl That is a promise we made Back in the day You told me that things wouldn't be this way I think we should work this out 'Cause all I didn't mean is to scream and shout  (repeat) Chorus  Life's not fair! Life's not fair! Life's not fair! I'm the jerk! Life's not fair! She loves me not! Loves me not!   "Hold Me Down" - Tommy Lee [Never A Dull Moment]   i don't make everyone happy... but it's ok..  i've been through this before  it's nothin new.. nothin new   i don't know why everytime i wanna fly  somebody always tries  to hold me down... hold me down...  i'm losing my faith every single time i try  no one is on my side  don't let me drown... let me drown   don't worry about whatcha done now cause it's ok  it's a test to see how much you can take.. it's nothin new   i don't know why everytime i wanna fly  somebody always tries  to hold me down... hold me down...  i'm losing my faith every single time i try  no one is on my side  don't let me drown... let me drown   i am drowning... i am sinking... yeah    More tomorrow...

I'm going to study my ass off for my upcoming Physics final and hope and pray that I pass the class with a C-.  Assuming I do well in the OTHER physics class I have to retake, I might actually get into the program.  God willing.  More updates soon.

      Today is a:  4  This is just not my week.  Monday night, I got to my car around 8pm after school to drive home.  I threw my stuff in my car and was on my way.  Not a mile yet down the street, I noticed that the battery light on my dash was lit up.  At this point, not only am I panicking (my car is practically brand new), but I'm also on the highway.  I exit the next exit to get to the closest and safest gas station I know of to call my dad (my cell phone was dead - I neglected to charge it).  Not only was the gas station I had in mind really far away, but I got lost en route to it.  Christ.  Oh yeah, did I mention that at this point, my check engine light and overheated engine light was also on?  Hopefully you get the full effect of why I freaked the fuck out.  I got ahold of dad who said that If my car runs, drive it home.  Me, not noticing the steam coming from the hood of my car, drove the 6 or so miles left home since my car was, for the better part, functional.  My poor car was quite steamy when I pulled into my driveway.  The car cooled down, and we popped the hood to find an empty overflow tank and a drained radiator.  Me, knowing nothing about cars, said, and I quote, "Uhhh....".  My baby was towed to Toyota the next morning.  Not only did I not make it to my first class, but the news I received from the dealership was quite, if you will, disturbing.  Appearantly, a furry animal, probably a possum, crawled up under my hood and got stuck in one of my belts.  Subsequentially, all my belts (my alternator belt, my serpentine belt, and some other belt I think)  were broke.  The mechanic informed my dad that they figured it out after they found a gruesome mess and a "small animal leg bone" in an undisclosed location under my hood.  Needless to say, I'm still rather disgusted with the imagery.  I can only imagine what the mechanics were thinking.  Anways..  It's late Wednesday morning, and I dont have my car yet.  Hopefully, it will be ready today.  Dad was, Thank God, able to get me to my other class yesterday and pick me up, as well as drop me off this morning.  I might have to take the bus home tonight, depending.  Oh well.  I can only get worse, I think.

      Today is a:  6  Today started off being a flat out 1.  I was awoken by my brother, Jake, because he missed his bus and needed a ride to school.  A rather large pile of envelopes was then shoved into my hand by Jake with the instructions that I was supposed to run these by the post office for dad.  Needless to say, the envelopes had stamps, but they had no return address.  I shrugged, dropped him off at school, and took the letters home to take care of the no return address drama.  Appearantly, I was supposed to mail these letters out, return address or not, because the collection time at the Post Office is 8 am.  Dad bitches at me, I bitch at Joe, my other brother, and Dad bitches at Joe.  At this point, it's 7:30 am and the bitch fest has already begun.  I am not too pleased at this point.  Not only do I STILL have to get ready to leave for the day myself, but now I have to go to the fucking Post Office before 8.  My car payment is due tomorrow and I hadn't sent that out yet.  An hour later, the mail has long been taken care of and I'm on my way to school.  I went to class, found out I kicked total ass on the last Physics quiz (which I guessed on 3 of 5 questions), and then I mailed off my car payment.  At this point, my day shot to a 6.  I rode the bus to the Union to stuff myself on some good Mexican Food (Taco Maker), then headed to the library to look over some Physics stuff.  I am now in the library's computer lab, wasting time untill my next class, which is my 3:30 Hebrew class.  I'm hoping my day stays decent.  More later.

      A quarter's insertion, the verdict is in.  Im an alternate.  And I'm STILL not sure how to react to that.  Anyways...  Last night was the Senior Party.  Oh My God it was a riot.  You never really know your co-workers untill alcohol is involved.  Laughs, jokes, crude comments, and general rediculous behaviour is observed.  Eddie and Dave were in charge of "Fear Factor".  AKA, we ate raw eggs and assorted goodies ranging from goldfish to earthworms for a grand prize of $105.  I made it to the last round (all 4 of us did), but some chick was just chugging down the God Awful blended creation that was chicken gizzards and hearts, the left over goldfish, the left over earthworms, the left over raw eggs, and god only knows what else Eddie and Darlene put in it.  The shit smelled like fish and tasted like ass.  God it was nasty.  I almost puked it up twice.  Afterwards, we went back to Dodge's and chilled.  They ate pizza and chatted while I passed out on the couch.  I barely got any sleep and I STILL feel like shit....  What a delightfully successful party.

      Ok, time for a Jen movie review.   I saw Spiderman tonight!  The movie kicked ass!  Not only did Tobey McGuire look totally hot in that tight suit, but the plot, the action, and the acting were excellent.  Jake would disagree, saying that the movie was "allright", but that's ok.  They picked an awesome cast for the movie.  Wonder if they'll make a sequel?  I hope so!  Rating:  5/5 stars!  *****    urlLink The Official Movie Website

      Jen's word of the day... Malignant Neoplasm.  While it means cancer, the words pop up on a daily basis while doing my paperwork at work.  I know this is horrible, but the word itself is so damn funny it makes me laugh.  Here are some examples of how I see the word in context daily.  Malignant Neoplasm, Colon Malignant Neoplasm, Breast (female) Malignant Neoplasm, Prostate  How does this word make you fell?  Leave me a comment and let me know.

      Today is a:  9!!  I figured out today exactly why I want to go into radiology.  I, a five foot nothing, can make a difference in people's lives.  Even though I might only speak with a patient for a few moments or help out on a X-Ray, CAT Scan, or MRI exam on them that only takes a short time, I can still use that small amount of time for a lot of things.  I can use that time to comfort a patient, I can use that time to reassure a patient, I can use that time to relate to that patient's concerns or medical problems on a more personal level if possible, I can make a patient laugh when he or she feels anxious or uncomfortable, I can answer a patient's questions, and, most importantly, I can listen.  I remember one time I assisted in a Lumbar Puncture back in Fluoroscopy.  My job?  To hold the patient's hand.  I realize that I wasn't really doing anything, but I still felt like I was doing something important.  It didn't really matter that my ankles and feet got the shit fluoroed out of them (the fluoro tube is on the floor, and I was standing next to it).  I think what all this leads to is the epiphany that I am a humanitarian.  Some people might disagree, saying that I'm crude and dont care about others, but I feel I need to contest that.  My reasoning?  I don't like to see people suffer.  I don't like to see people hurt.  Inversely, people don't like to suffer and they don't like to be hurt.  And that's why I think the medical profession is right for me.  I see patients with terminal cancer.  I see patients with badly broken bones that need painful surgery.  I see patients on respirators hanging on dearly for their lives.  Yes, this deeply upsets me to see any human being in such shape, but, i know I can at least try to make a difference.  I know I will have accomplished something great in my life.  And thats why this X-Ray kid loves her job.  "A light heart carries you through all the hard times"      -Fortune Cookie

      Yay!  The  urlLink Friday Five  is back up, perhaps under new management.  Anyways....here's my Friday Five for this week:    1. How often do you do laundry?   Like once a month.   2. What's in a typical wash load?  Usually clothes.   3. Front or top loader? Powder or liquid detergent?   I have a top loading washer.  I adore liquid detergent!   4. Do you use fabric softener in the rinse cycle?    No.  Should I?   5. Dryer or clothesline?    Dryer.  I am TOO impatient to wait for the clothes to dry on a clothes line.

      Jeez, its been no long since I've blogged...where do I begin?  I finished my last final (Physics) a little bit ago.  Im actually off work today, so I'll be going to go look at some apartments with Steph.  Thank god I'm done with school for a while (feh...it's back to school in a few weeks).    I got a speeding ticket yesterday.  And I think its funny.  I was going down Interstate 270, maybe about 5 miles from work, going about 85.  I saw a cop in the distance parked on the side of the road, but I wasn't going to put on the brakes.  If the cop saw that, that would probably piss him off.  I opted to just take my foot off the accelerator, but my car didn't decelerate fast enough.  I passed him a few seconds later, he pulled out behind me, and pulled me over.  He busted me going 77 in a 65 zone.  So what...shit happens.  The humorous part of this situation is that my radar detector didn't go off.  Maybe it didn't detect it if he was radaring me as he followed me instead of as I passed him parked on the side of the road?  Hmm.  Anyways, I was expecting this situation to piss me off and I was expecting the cop to be a dick.  But neither happened.  I actually had a positive experience getting a speeding ticket.  I even thanked the nice cop for my $100 ticket.  Heh...  Mom and Dad are going to be pissed when I tell them.  Other than that, life's decent, I guess.  Been slacking on the guitar playing, because I've been feeling oh so not inspired to write anything.   Maybe I'll work some more on a song that I've been working on.  And, of course, I'll be working a gazillion hours a week, working doubles on Saturdays and Sundays.  I know I'm stupid for doing nothing  but working, but oh well.  Money is good!  Well, thats the current adventures of Jen for a while.  Talk to you later.

      Something surreal happened today.  I had played guitar for about an hour and was about to retire for a short nap when I realized that it was raining.  Hard.  What did I do?  I opened my blinds all the way and admired the rain.    I never used to, but now I love the rain.  I've come to the conclusion that the reasoning behind this is that it reminds me of Orlando.  It reminds me of lunch time with my best friends at school, under the cement courtyard roof.  It reminds me of trips to certain places with certain people.  It reminds me of a vibe I felt only in Orlando.  It reminds me that I'm alive.  It doesn't really rain too often in Ohio.  It rained alot in Orlando.  Maybe that's why I feel so depressed living in Ohio now.  God I wish it would rain everyday.  I think rain is one of the most beautiful elements (if it's even considered an element).  I actually find my fascination with rain to make perfect sense, because my Zodiac Sign, the Scorpion, is a water element.  Shit.  It stopped raining.  Dammit!

      Yeah, I know.  It's been a while.  So here's the update, in case anyone still cares.  Steph, Jen, and I got our apartment.  We move in Sep 18.  I'm actually very excited and very scared at the same time.  I've never been on my own before!  Classes this summer are going good.  I'm very excited about all the stuff I will learn in my X-Ray classes.  I also feel that Physics will be a breeze.  Everything else in life is ok.  A friend of mine wrote in their diary that alot of "scenes" in her life are put to music.  She went on to explain that some "scenes" in life just didn't feel complete without music accompanying it.  When I look back on my life, at the point where I was a high school student in Orlando, I find myself agreeing.  In Orlando, I made some pretty special friends.  These friends were not just my ordinary friends.  They weren't even my best friends.  These were people who shaped me into the kind of person I am today.  They inspired me.  They cultured me.  They showed me "the life".  The one person I think that sticks out the most in that category would be Meghan.  Meghan is two years older than me, and for the most part, I hung out with her and her friends in high school.  I met her at my first job, and the friendship grew.  We would take weekend trips to the beach as often as possible with her crew.  We would have so much fun.  Fun I never knew existed.  Meg became like the big sister I never had.  She became my tour guide to life.  She balanced me.  As you can imagine, I was broken when we moved to Ohio and I had to leave her behind.  Anyways, getting back to my point.  I was driving along the other day and I popped in a CD that I had burned and had not listened to in a long time.  A song came on that provoked some serious emotions.  I almost broke down in tears.  The song was Shania Twain's "Your Still The One".  No matter how much you think this song sucks, this song always makes me quiver when i hear it.  Why?  This was a favorite song of ours to jam to on the way to the beach.  It reminds me of the better times.  It reminds me of my big sister that I've missed so much.  I can still visualize sitting in the backseat of her car as we drove to the beach, all occupants of the car singing along to Shania.  I can remember actually laughing and feeling care free.  Feeling  happy .  I hope this story finds you all well.  I plan on visiting my sis soon, perhaps in the autumn or winter.  Until then, take care of yourselves.  And listen to plenty of music.

       Hi kids...  Well, it's been a fucking hella long weekend.  Work was a bit hairy this week, with JCAHO at the hospital.  JCAHO are these people who come to the hospital every other year and make sure we're doing everything right.  Kinda scary.  We got a 94 though.  All's well there.  Home life, however, is fucked.  My grandma has a abdominal aortic aneurysm.  She'll probably have to have surgery.  Mom and Joe are in Illinois with hier.  Everyday, I feel more and more like an outcast with my roommates.  Nothing I say is funny or is as important as what they say to each other.  Is it because I haven't known them as long as they've known each other?  Am I just that stupid and annoying?  God only knows.    I've been becoming overly stressed about the X-Ray school thing.  Every fucking time I turn around at work, the Junior clinical rotation sheet is right there, staring back at me.  And guess what.  My name isn't fucking on it.  Everyone else's names are, but not mine.  Fuck That.  It pisses me off when people who have no desire, hunger, or passion get the gold, while the truly passionate and sincere ones get fucked and shut out.  Goddamn it.  I'm going to have my own little aneurysm here if I dont chill.  Later.

       Geez...it has been so long, and I apologize.  But I finally moved out!   I'm on my own now!  No one can ever understand how I feel right now.  It feels invigorating.  It feels rightous.  I feel liberated.  Things are working out ok.  Finally got DSL today.  Its ok, but there's already a few problems.  We're gonna have to get a router.  And that sucks.  But that's life.  More to come later.

      Well, Thanksgiving came and went.  Even though we didn't eat our official dinner at home like we have since 1985, Ryan's Steakhouse on W. 161 gave a bountiful feast that we were thankful for.    I also have discovered some other things I am thankful for.    1.  My family.  Even though I moved out and they piss me off a lot, I still love them.   I miss them a lot, too.  I think they have more respect for me now that I'm on my own, and I think I have more respect for them as my family now that I'm out on my own.  Love ya guys.  2.  My job.  Yes, even though I work a lot and I get tired of shit there sometimes, I still love my job and my co-workers.  It's like a second family, especially with Sharon being my second mom and all.  I have come to find a great deal of respect and admiration for my co-workers and our profession.  I would like to take this opportunity to give a special shout out to Nitia, who has become like an idol to me.  She's a very smart and authoritive woman, which seems to be a problem for other people who don't take the time to get to know her and listen to what she has to say.  For those with hate for Nitia, bite me.  I hope your recovery goes well, Nish.  I know I'll miss you.  3.  Sharon.  What can I say?  I know you'll probably read this, so I want to take the time to let you know just how important you are to me.  There was a time not so long ago where I didn't have the strength or will to even get up in the morning.  Everything seemed to go wrong.  Then you came along and took me under your wing, mending me and showing me things I never knew were worth looking for within myself.  I am eternally grateful to you and all your wisdom.  Thanks again, Mom.  Well, another Thanksgiving has came and gone, but the things I am thankful for are eternal.  I hope you were blessed today as much as I was.

      Well, not much has really changed since I wrote last.  I still want to kill my roommates (the reasons keep multiplying...) and I still work too much.    I'm hoping Thursday will be eventful.  I'm going home, but my mom's not cooking dinner this year.  This ought to be interesting.  Especially if Dad cooks.  Hopefully I'll be able to pass out soon here.  I have to work in the morning.  Maybe I'll take some NyQuil for this cold thats starting to creep up on me.    Talk to you later.

      It's time for some Jen movie reviews.  1.  The Jackass Movie  **  2 stars (out of 5)  This movie is not for the weak of heart.  It contains nudity, violence, and some pretty fucked up shit.  While some skits are downright hilarious, others should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and the other Jackasses do everything you could imagine and more:  Shocking their genitalia and other body parts, lighting firecrackers from their asses, sticking Matchbox Cars in their asses,  majorly distressing Mr. and Mrs. Margera, beating the holy shit out of each other, and other stuff that makes my stomach hurt just thinking about.  While it's refreshing to see such garbage do well in the theatres, I'm aftraid I really can't suggest this movie to anyone. __________________  2.  8 Mile  ***  3 stars (out of 5)      Ahh....Eminem's debut movie.  What else can I say?  The movie was decent.  Eminem is surprisingly good as an actor, to add to his rapping talent.    The movie is based on a character "loosely" based on Em and his life.  8 Mile, while maintaining my interest and curiosity, was well worth the money paid.  However, I feel the movie would have been better if it was actually about Em, and had not ended on the note it did.  It would have been nice to see how Em rose out of the obscurity of Detroit's trailer courts.  Amen.  I would definately recommend this movie.

      Ok...so life isn't really much better, but lets see:  The roommate situation isn't any better, but I've fixed at least one thing.  My computer will now prompt for my password after the screen saver goes on.  That'll teach them to fuck with my shit when I'm not home.  I'm still non-existant to them and I'm sure they'll find some other way to fuck me over, but at least the comp is safe.  Jesus.  In a manic fit of creativity, I'm working on 3 new songs.  One is called "Wonder Why", the other is called "Don't Wanna", and the third one is yet untitled.  I'm hoping to attain decent recordings of these, for these could be the best I've written (musically, not lyrically) yet.  Other than the above mentioned issues/events, nothing is really going on but work.  And lots of work.  Stay tuned...   ...and keep your pants on.

       Ok, I know it's been a long time, but a lot of shit is going down.  Too much drama with my mom.  Too much personal drama.  Too much.  Too much.  Too much.  My roommates are fucking driving me crazy.  It's like they hate me.  Everything I do is wrong, and I am SO close to cracking.  I'm not asking a lot here, either.  I'm not asking them to kiss my ass and be my best friends.  I'm just asking that they....acknowledge that I exist, perhaps?  Yeah.  And it would be nice if they didn't constantly fuck with my shit when I'm at work.  Getting phone messages would be nice, instead of beating them out of them a week after someone calls.  I might not be the worlds best roommate, but I at least give phone messages and I don't fuck with their shit.  It's such rediculous bullshit.  Seriously.  Grandma is doing fine now.  She's been home for a while now, and got through her surgery well.  Ironically enough, it was some X-Rays that discovered the aneurysm no one knew she had.  Somehow I feel....inspired?  obligated?  to continue on with my quest for X-Ray school.  Damn I feel special now.  Anyways, as far as work, everything is normal there.  I'm still working an ungodly amount of hours, but I'm getting tons of fluoro experience, which I think will benefit me the most.  Nitia is teaching me all kinds of good stuff.  Hmm...you know, I'm glad I didn't get into the program this year.  With Jon in that class, I almost feel bad for the other students who don't know shit.  One smartass in the class of 24 is bad enough, but 2 would just be asking for trouble.  Besides, I want to be the ONLY shining star in my class.  Sorry, Jon.    Well, I think I've bitched and ranted enough for a while.  Until next time....

       urlLink  Hello out there in the 'net.  As Christmas and the New Year near us, I would like to take the time to point out that this blog celebrated it's first birthday on December 14th.  Amazing, eh?  God, I've been through so much this year, that reading the back logs kind of blows my mind.  It's also kind of depressing, because I don't really feel like I've grown as a person.  Oh well.  The situation at the apartment is, for the time being, good.  Perhaps it's because I stood up for myself?  Perhaps they have pity on the less fortuneate on the holidays?  Who knows.  I haven't been home in several weeks.  It's kind of embarrasing, because I kind of forgot my mother's birthday (It was December 12th).  I know exactly what to get her (a new book by one of her favorite authors, Jonathan Kellerman), so hopefully I'll get my ass home soon and give it to her.  Well, it's almost past my bed time, so I'm getting off here.  Later.

      Today was a very unproductive day.    I wasn't feeling well, so I lounged in my PJs all day, and did absolutely nothing but watch TV and make a Stoffer's Veggie Lasagne.  I wasn't even feeling well enough to work on my house designs (designing houses has become a passion, secondary to x-ray).  I watched the news, Who Wants to Be a Millionare, 8 Simple Rules to Dating My Teenage Daughter, Frazier, and According to Jim.  Good stuff.  Well, I'm trekking off to bed.  Gotta get up early and try to feel better for a fun filled day of Fluoro.

      Hello everyone and Happy New Year!! (Yeah, I know it's already the 10th, but oh well.  I've been busy).  Christmas and New Year was fine, and I got to spend a good chunk of the holidays with my family.  I got a sweet fleece warm-up set, a gold necklace with a cool OSU charm, and a Boyd's Bear (The doctor one, of course).  A few of my relatives came from Pittsburgh for New Years, and the food was a plenty that night.  Later on, after us "kids" watched the Scooby Doo movie, I went to Shelley's and watched the ball drop on TV.  Not much, but it was cool.  It was back to school for me on Monday, the 6th, and I would like to say that I really didn't want to go back.    I find the stuff I'll learn in Physics class quite interesting, but there's that whole homework/class/study thing.  Oh well.  That's really all for now, so I'll check in when I find the time or when I find something else interesting to say.

      I know it's been way too long since I've posted (or so it would seem for those who are addicted to my website), and I offer no excuses.  I've been super busy and trying to make the best of life.  One of the first things I'd like to address is the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster.  I was horrified at first when I learned of the disaster, and I quickly became saddened about the situation as I watched the Memorial on TV today.  It brings me such grief and sorrow to know that people with such accomplished and diverse backgrounds have left us so abruptly.    I have always been intrigued by the vast realms of space.  It takes such commitment and bravery to master space travel, and I always held astronauts past and present in such great esteem for their ventures and accomplishments.  This is the second Space Flight disaster to occur within my lifetime (I was six when the Challenger  exploded in 1986).  I really wish to not have to witness anymore in my remaining years.  May God bless the familes of the Columbia Crew.   On a lighter note:  Friday the 31st was one of the best times I have ever had.  Gen and I conspired for me to drive down to Portsmouth to celebrate Gen's birthday.  The conspiracy behind it?  Sharona didn't know I was coming down.  Sharona's stepdad answered the door and told her she had a visitor.  I wish I had a camera with me, because the look on Sharona's face was PRICELESS when she came down the stairs and saw me there.  We did all kinds of fun stuff that night.  We played chess, watched TV and a couple of movies, we played Scrabble (FEZ!!!), and made a wonderful mexican dinner that all could enjoy (Gen, Christopher, and Andrea are vegetarians).  Such a delightful night that I will soon not forget.  Well, I've ran out of things to say.  Go figure.  Until next time...

      Well, Spring Break brought some surprises along with the normalites of my life.  As for the normalities, I'm still finding myself engaging in roommate guerilla warfare.  JLC needs to realize that I'm not her bitch, her permanent dishwasher, or her loan center that accepts rediculously late payments of her phone bill share.  I'm a pretty relaxed and free spirit, but if provoked, I WILL go to war, battle face paint and all.  Enough is enough;  My buttons have been pushed repeatedly and they're getting warn out.  I'll move on to the pleasant abnormalites now, since they outweigh the normailites.  I'm starting a band with this dude named Matt.  Matt and I are very excited about this band, and I hope it prospers.  I'll, of course, be playing guitar and Matt will sing, maybe even play bass if we can't find a bass player.  No band name or material has emerged yet, but I feel confident that we'll do OK.  I looked in my mailbox Saturday to find my X-Ray license.  I'm very excited, for this opens considerably good options as far as employment.  In a nod to my current job, Nitia finally came back to her weekend spot and I couldn't be happier.  I missed her authoritarianism and inspiring ass-kickings involving doctors and other health care members.  I owe my no-nonsense attitude to her.  Welcome back, Nish!  Last, but not least, I'm getting ANOTHER guitar.  I'm building this one myself though.  I ordered all the parts from Warmoth.  The body is Alder wood and the neck is all maple, with the huge 70's headstock.  I'm leaving the body plain, no paint.  It's also going to have all black hardware (EVERYTHING black, even the pickguard and pickup covers).  I gutted my old shit-kicker Strat copy and I'm going to use all the electronics from it for my new guitar.  I can't wait!  Well, I think I've explained myself pretty well.  Before I go, I have a few last words, concerning the current situation in Iraq.  FUCK WAR AND FUCK BUSH!

       It's been 1 week and 3 days.  No cigarette.  I couldn't be happier, and I don't owe it all to not smoking.  See, my life is very good right now.  Suspiciously good.    School is cruising by, work is fine, and my relationship with my roomies is much better (I could give you more information, but that might be incriminating to the three of us, LoL).  I get my income tax check direct deposited today, there's a goodbye party for Eric Saturday (I'll miss Biggie....  -sniff-), and i bought some new rollerblades yesterday (I kind of want to get back into playing street hockey).  All is VERY well now.  I'll be sure to come back and rant in a few days when my life manages to fall apart again.

Today proved to be quite challenging.  I bought lots of gum and hard candy to chew on while at work, and it seemed to help calm the craving.  Hopefully tomorrow will be just as productive.

      How I've had the time of my life, and I owe it all to you.  I have done nothing but drink the past three nights.  It's kind of scary to be drinking that much, so it will probably be a while until I drink again.  Last night, however, proved to be the pinnacle of my drinking fun.  I actually got up and danced.  The music was great, the mood was right, and I danced with one of the guys from downstairs.  His girlfriend, who was also there, probably did not appreciate it, but oh well.  It was great.  I'm not even going to go to the Sr/Jr party at Maz's tonight, because I really dont need to be drinking 4 nights in a row.  Even if some awesome music was playing and there was a lot of dancing, I still dont think I'd go. I need like a week to recover.  Erg.  Since when did I become an alcoholic?

       Hello, world.  [the immortal first Java output text]  Been a while since I've talked to you, so I figured I'd drop by.  All is well at the moment, and [yay!] it's going to rain today [and throughout this week and next week].  Quite irritated that I was awoken by a storm at 7 this morning [after only 3 hours of sleep], but oh well.  Warmoth has processed my custom guitar parts order, so I'll have my parts by mid June.  I rearranged my bedroom, and I've worked on a new house design.  Been busy, but life is good.  Well I must run now, but I just wanted to update you and let everyone know how I was doing [Sharona's probably the only one who will read this, if not the only one interested in seeing how I'm doing].

While waiting to leave, I decided to check my Yahoo! and OSU mail accounts.  My OSU mail popped up and I found an e-mail that changed my life.  My future is now prospectively laid out for me, and, well, what I'm trying to say is:  I GOT INTO X-RAY SCHOOL!!!  I'm very excited and anxious at the same time.  It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I think I"ll be ok.

      Hello and welcome to the new and improved blog that is Jen's life. Blogger royally screwed up and somehow gave someone else my blogger account. My old blog and blog archives are lost. I guess I should not lose heart and just restart my Blogger. I apologize to all who were looking forward to routine updates: I've just been too lazy this summer to blog.   In all truthfullness, the silence of my Blog this summer is representitive of the quiet and boring summer I've had. I've just been working a lot (40+ hours a week) and not really much of else. I went to Dayton a few times to visit Sara and even made it to Portsmouth once. All in all, my summer was pretty decent. Could it be the calm before the storm? I start X-Ray school in 12 days, and I can only imagine my life will be turbulent for a while.   A few other points of interest:   Jake turned 16 on Sep 9. Happy Birthday.  My roomie brought home a kitten! Too adorable.  We succesfully moved into our new apartment a couple of weeks ago.   I can't really think of anything else that's worth sharing right now, so I'll close this out, hoping to get back into the blog of things.

      I totally have an obsession with the Zoloft commercial Ovoid Creature (otherwise known as the Zoloft blob).  The Ovoid thing is so adorable, which is why he's the background for every page!  Life update:  Well, Monday starts the third week of clinicals at Childrens.  It's pretty cool there (its a really nice hospital) and I'll hopefully get my ped chest comped soon.  I can't really think of anything else important, so....until next time.

      DE blog is back!  After many issues (like my blog being given away...), I'm back in school and anxious to write again.  I'll try my best to get back into the blog of things.  I know not too many people read this and/or comment on my postings, but it's personally fascinating to watch me grow as a person through my blogs.  Hope my loyal readers agree with me (Sharon, this is where you come in. lol).    I spent the majority of my summer in Fluoro (always a treat... :) ) and was quite anxious to start school.  The third week of classes has already went by, and we've already had 2 quizzes and a midterm.  Was I dissilusioned into thinking I'd have an unfair advantage?  Because I don't think I have any type of advantage in classwork.  We start clinicals on Monday.  I'm at Childrens for 4 weeks.  I don't know what to think about that.  Well, I'm out.  I'm going to try to enjoy the rest of my weekend and not stress too much over clinicals.  P.S. heres a pic of the kitty!  urlLink Scout

      Fuckin' Awesome.  So I've neglected this thing for far too long, but oh well.&nbsp; Deal with it.  I can't express enough how much of a pain in the ass movng is.&nbsp; Not to mention that I'm moving back to my parents house (with Oliver, my kitty).  Just when I thought shit couldn't get worse, found out today I failed my Philosophy midterm.&nbsp; Fuck it.
