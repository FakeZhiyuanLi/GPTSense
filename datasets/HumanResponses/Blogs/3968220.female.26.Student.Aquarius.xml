       My god!!!! Today, i just read through the Teenage Magazine, i found out tat Li Young (from K-one) 's birthday is just one day before my birthday. Then, i found out tat J.R.(from K-one) 's birthday is 3 days after my birthday!! 
So coincidental! &nbsp; 
 My birthday is on 2nd November, Li Young's birthday is on 1st November n J.R.'s birthday is on 5th November!
