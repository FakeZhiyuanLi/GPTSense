          I would like to jump on a train and not know where its going. I would like to be surprised at its destination. I would like a one-way ticket to nowhere. Just pack my toothbrush, a change of clothes, and my wallet and see where I would end up at. I could stroll along at my own pace and see things on my own time. When I am older this will be my plan, when I have been loosened of the responsibilities that I have now, I will do this. I will purchase a train ticket and see what happens.

        I am sure anyone reading my other post will think I must hate people, hate life...no this is not the case. I simply get irritated easy with peoples actions. And I am not the type of person to say something, I just get irritated and leave it. But being around the general public all day is no walk in the park. It amazes me how people act, how they are rude, could care less, and what annoys me at this very moment is people who act happy, now I am not saying people who are truly happy, but people who go out of their way to be happy. Come on get a damn life people, it does not get any better by pretending to be happy, you are just masking the inevitable. Just a thought from one who sees it.

         I   have noticed today that my wardrobe is mostly black and gray....I don't understand when this happened and why this has happened. Well I do know black hides the spots I can't imagine any one else seeing and well gray just goes with black. Ok, so now I have it figured out, but I must add some color to my wardrobe, I am not as boring as I appear. I will make a conscience effort to buy at least one shirt that is not black or gray. Damn this job...Looking professional shouldn't be this boring, at least I dress better than half these yahoos    that work here....lol.

        sitting here watching the buses pull away from the curb. watching life zoom past the large windows that tease us with what goes on outside. i want to be out there announces the people on the bus, walking in the rain, going somewhere other then here. no more of this, no more sitting on this side of the window, its time to be on the outside looking in. birds don't sing on this side, sunshine does not pour out of the horrible fluorescent lighting, and there is no light breeze moving past. i am better than this place, i am better than what they think, i will walk away, i will walk to the busstop and zoom away, past the windows that once teased me.

       What is it with guys ? I have had it with guys. I have had it with everyone. "I want a girl who is educated." Yes thank you for telling me I am too stupid to put up with your smartest. Just because I have not finished college does not make me stupid, I am more intelligent than most, but don't use that line of crap on me. Sorry I have chosen not to be in debt for the rest of my life. Sorry I chose to live my life, then sit in a classroom and learn about crap, that will get me a job I will so hate. Honesty, that is all I am asking for here, just someone to say, the real reason I am breaking it off, is because you have a fat ass, not because I did not go to college. Yes pure honesty, I could put up with that, but to tell me a line of crap, please. This is me venting about the bullshit I have come to put up with. You know the whole its not you, its me thing. HA!

       I am convinced that I will be alone, that life will surely pass me by and leave me out to rust. I am having one of those damn days again. I am frustrated with this life of mine, needing to change it but don't have a clue how to start, where to start. I have a job that pays crap, live with my parents who do mean well, have no social life since moving to this dreadful state of Oregon. Oh what the hell am I talking about, I had no social life before. That is just it, I prefer no social life, if I had one I know I would go crazy. Being around people makes me, well I will just try and be nice. So I am going to change it, how? You ask, I have no clue, but damnit, I will.
