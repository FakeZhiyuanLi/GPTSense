      u kno...i've never understood how people can pour all their thoughts and secrets into something lyk this...i guess there's alwayz sumthing new to learn...so here i am, trying it out.   lesse...skools about to end...and i guess thas good, but i'm not even sure anymore.  I feel so lost cuz i have absolutely no idea wat i'm gonna do over the summer...and i've been getting into hecka fights w/ my g/f recently, and for sum reason, i doubt i can hold on too much longer.  Background...i guess if anybody ever wants to understand why such simple problems can turn so complicated...i have to explain how i feel about them...  I've always been very idealistic in my views on love...and i guess for some reason, that has led me to be ok with being mistreated.  I alwayz felt that there should only be one person in your life...totally idealistic i kno...and i thot that i should wait out until i'm out of high school as well...hahaa...as you can see, that didn't work out too good.  So i screwed everything up i guess...cuz it wuz the first time i ever realli liked a girl i guess...before that it wuz prolly jus lyk lust or sumthing.  I never realli got to kno or talk to them too much.  This was all 2 years ago by the way...anyways.  I used to be a total loser =op not nemore...but still i can't handle big crowds of ppl i don't kno.  Anyway...when i screwed everything up, i guess i started to expect too much from the relationship cuz she didn feel the same way i did.  I have this way of manipulating ppl and can realli make ppl feel bad...i guess u could all say i'm a horrible person for doing this...but don't even try to tell me that you don't do it too.  Newayz...the whole thing getz entirely screwed over because her parents and totally bitchy and don't understand a thing about modern relationships or the american ideals...privacy either.  They expect that couples should help each other "study"...MY ASS...nobody gets together with somebody just to help each other study...itz because they enjoy time together and they care about each other and making the other person happy.  Anyhoo...point is...her parents don't get it and should totally be shipped off to china cuz they threaten me with a whole buncha crap lyk court casings and having achievements of mine taken away.  I tell them...they don't have a case...i never told their daughter to run away, i only gave her advice...and its her decision whether she wants to take it or not.  and they're the ones that should be sued...they don't have any sense of privacy.  They somehow hooked up a laptop to monitor their daughters computers...so they sumhow got a copy of a private conversation we had online...and they try to listen on the fone so much itz not even funni...sometimes i wonder if any of this is worth it anymore.  moving on...skool problems ^^ aren't i just a happy person =op.  i guess i depend too much on things...and i get my hopes up so i slack off...i really shouldn't and i should keep my mind on the thot that i prolly wont' get anywhere but the local community college.  I don't know how else to fix things though...i'm good at studying...i'm just sick of high school, i can't handle the dumass written work...thas gotta be the least effective way of learning things..and video projects?! thats messed up.  Uhm...i guess i shouldn't pour all my problems on you poor readers on the first day huh? ^^ nite nite then i guess...  rex~out
