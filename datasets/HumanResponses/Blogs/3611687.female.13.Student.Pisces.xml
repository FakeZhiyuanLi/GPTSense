        12/6/2004      I go to school at Bayswater South Primary School. I am in grade 6 and am 12 years old. In my grade we are working on a project. It's called the 'Restaurant Project'. It is such a big project it is taking the whole term. There is much work involved. It is now due in two weeks.    At the start of my project on the paper it says, You have been given a large amount of money from a wealthy distant relative. Then it says , After searching you have found the old Dunlavon General Store and you have bought it. Then you have to set up the restaurant. You hire Pablo   the Painter and then you have to work out the area of the ceiling and walls of each room to be painted. Then you need to work out how much paint you need and what the cost is. Once that task has been completed you must work on the carpeting. You have hired Carrie's Carpets for       the carpeting. Then you have to work out the area of the amount of rooms that need to be carpeted. Then again you need to work out how much carpet needed and the cost. After  that  task is completed you need to get started on the tiling. You have decided to hire Toby the Tiler. Then again you must work out the area of the remaining rooms for tiling. Then like before you need to work out how many tiles and the cost.        Then you have to work out the furniture. You must work out how many chairs you will need and the cost of all the furniture. Then it says by now you have spent another $50 000 on kitchen supply and anything else needed.  So now you have to add up all the costs of setting up the restaurant: Painting, Carpeting, Tiling, Furniture and the extra $50 000. That total is one section completed.        Then you have to write adds in the paper for staff but not real ones. You also have to design all the staff's uniforms and it says that you have to write and invitation to a celebrity for the opening of your restaurant and a magazine reporter is coming as well and his name is Stew Dapple. You have to write Stew's report of the restaurant. You have to write duties for the waiters and you need to write 10 health and safety rules for all the staff.       At the end you have more maths to do. When your restaurant is up and running you have to work out how much you are going to pay the staff plus other expenses for the week and the icome and profit. By now you are finished.  My restaurant is called Arabian Nights because my dad is arabic. I am going to write my reataurant name in arabic. By now I am doing very well on my project and are very close to finishing it. I hope I get a good mark for it.

        9/8/04          Two days ago I went my friends sleepover. It was really fun. I went to her house at 1 in the afternoon. We talked for a while and then we went to the movies at about 2:30. We saw New York Minute. It was awsome. When we got back we played a game called Tommy. We have a plate of lollies and one person goes out of the room. The other people have to pick a lolly then call the person back into the room. That person starts picking lollies and when they pick the lolly everyone has chosen everyone yells out 'TOMMY' and that person doesn't get anymore lollies.     It was fun. After that we played a balloon game in the lounge room. We had balloons that we had to keep off the ground. The last one to catch their balloon when the music was off is out. It was lots of fun. Then we played truth or dare. It was cool. I had to kiss my friend's little brother!! Then we went to La Porcheta for dinner. Three of us had spaghetti bolanaise and the birthday girl had pizza. We kept putting coke and rasberry soft drink in each others' spaghetti bolanaise. It was funny. Then when we got home we got in to our sleeping bags and watched SpyKids 3D and then my friends brothers went to bed. Then we watched Freaky Friday and then the Haunted Mansion. It was scary. Then we played for a while. We talked and played sleeping bag tumbles. We rolled across the matrasses in our sleeping bags. It was fun. Then we drew on each others' backs with our fingers. Then we watched Cheaper By The Dosen and then we got to sleep at about 4 in the morning. Then on Sunday morning my mum picked me up at about 10:00. My lolly  basket  smarties, molteasers, snakes, timeouts and fads (lolly ones). It was a great party.          That sunday (after the party) my mum took me shopping. I got some stickers and a new handbag it's really cool. It's brown with a small blue heart in the corner and has two pockets on the front. It was lots of fun shopping with mum. For lunch we went to Knox Ozone to Sakura. We had a lunchbox each and a melon drink. The lunchbox has fried rice, sushi (with caviar), chicken and a salad. It was deeeeelicious. I had lots of fun this weekend.
