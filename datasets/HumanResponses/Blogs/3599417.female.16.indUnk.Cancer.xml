      I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it didn't even matter. I had to fall to lose it all but in the end it didn't even matter. ....

      I am tired of watching all these fairy tail stories on tv and wishing for something as such to happen to me.  I've never watched soap operas because there was just too much Nicole having an affair with Falicity's husband and such... but now things have become a soap opera sadly to say.  and I hate it.  I know, you must think I'm rambling on about absolutely nothing but, I'm not, I just can't explain it here. I AM too nice.  I am the one who changes the way I say things so I don't hurt peoples feelings.  I am the one who can change herself because I think that will help get a guy- It's wrong and will never happen again.  I'm the one who steps aside for others yet I get walked all over.  I don't like it and it tears me apart,but why should anyone notice.  I do hide things and I shouldn't.  Right now I am hiding that my best friend, who listened to my problems has now become a problem in a way I never thought she'd be...ever. and when I say this I promise you I'm not being over dramatic.  This is the way things have been going down. Nothing's a competition.  I can't believe I was going to sit back and take it.  It's not the right thing to do.  I just want to be held sometime in my life, is that so wrong?  I don't want to watch everything else- fuck your logic Malbert...Socrates himself would shun you.   I will unveil the whole story later, when things cool down or whatever.     Please God, help me.

      What happens when you love so much, you lose? Retracing moves on an antique chess board to only meet the tolling shadows of black and a chaste king caged  and claustrophobic  It is only when tears drip to land on checkered squares 'tween strands of strained hair  That the sweeping janitor greyly comes and looks only at the clock He utters "You've been here three hours."  and you look at raptured light peeking behind the open gym doors through tears, almost nonchalantly. Then at the clock  which  ticks  and return  "Yes I have."  and try to figure once again that there is still an alternative.  -JBS

      Well...I'm assistent section leader of the Lincoln Way East Mellos.  It is a big job even though it's not head section leader.  I'm really amazed at what good information I'm giving and how I'm helping.  It's not that I thought I wasn't capable.  It was just new...I was a little nervous at first... There will come a time when I make a wrong decision, I know.  It has to happen.  But, I will learn from it. We have 4 new members in our section.  All GIRLS!!! Check out that estrogen! The four girls are struggling.  They're new and it's the 3rd rehearsal since they've been freshmen.  It's okay.  But three are really pushing hard, even though they still need work, but one is just plain lazy.  I don't understand it...and it's hard to motivate them when they don't know what they are working for.  You know?  Field show season starts in August.  This is the part that sucks...the beginning.  The basics, the parades.  I love it, but I know they think differently.  When these girls get tired they break rank...which they know is wrong.  They rest their arms or their bells on their stomachs.  This one girl in particular, looks around first to see if anyone is watching then just drops.  I'm not so much mad at them, but at myself.  Her parents are making her do this, she doesn't want to.  I'm figuring out what to do.  She just doesn't like to focus or take things seriously even though she acts like it.  I'll probably talk to the tech tomorrow after a first basics block if she hasn't  shown a slight bit of improvement.

      It's 90 degrees out.  I walked around in 2 shirts, black and lwe polo shirt, shorts, and flip flops...but was hotter than I expected.  It really takes it out of you when you try to make money for your school and everybody treats you like dirt.  I went to 22 houses today.  Most people were home but didn't bother to answer the door.  I made a grand total of $1.00...amazing, right?  The lady paid me to go away.  Man,..today's one of my more mello days too. Hmm. "Harrumph" Oh well.  Forget them...I've copied down their license plate numbers, their cars will NOT get washed.  I saw "The day after tomorrow"...it was okay.  I ate chili-cheese fries...they were supposed to be just cheese but Loewes screwed up.  My gain though.  Lol...I just feel totally sick...it may be because of that or it maybe be because of the one man that answered the door in naught but a pair of black, silk shorts and a gold chain.  He told me, blatently that it was "The wrong time."  I didn't ask....I didn't have to...I just left.  Oh, did I mention this man was about 60? lakjdf;lakjpoweiutdlkjdsjlksdjlkkkkkkkkkkkkk'- Sorry my cringing and shuddering turned into a momentary convulsion.

      "You can get further with a kind word and gun, than you can with just a kind word." -Robert Di Nero as Al Capone.   Ahhh...home alone, with no worries.  I'll have to do some laundry and what not, but for the most part it's a pretty free day.  Listened to Vanguard 98-99, awesome shows by the way!  Got my forum fix, cooked popcorn, drank 64 ounces of water, and now I'm watching Jimminy Glick.  Lol..Martin Short.  As soon as my Mom gets home I'm driving over to Kristina's house and we're going to go see Harry Potter 3! W00t! That excites me... I love watching movies on the big screen.  Except when people are talking, babies are crying, or cell phones are going off- that annoys me.  I had an excellent conversation with my band sibling a couple days ago. It was like 25 minutes long, but it seemed longer.  Lol, I was happy.  I'm not sure if I've made my ultimate decision, but I'd really like to march Vanguard, I've decided.  Location will play a part in my decision though because I don't know if I can afford to pay airfare and a membership fee.  Hell, it would suck if I flew to Cali and didn't make it.  I have a feeling Scheherezade will be ridiculously incredible.  I can't wait.  Top 5 prediction -for you Chris...and me...and others...and yes...  1) Blue Devils 2)Cavaliers 3)Cadets 4)Santa Clara Vanguard 5)Phantom Regiment  You know- I really hope Madison pulls 6th or higher.  Here's the shortest poem I've ever written:  A kiss of death A kiss of life Ruinous resuscitation I wish I were the rain.  Comment as felt.

      "Well, I'll tell ya, it's touching.  Like a lot of things in life, we laugh because it's funny and we laugh because it's true.  Some people say...reformers here say, 'Put that man in jail.  What does he think he is doing?'  Well, what I hope I am doing-and here's where your English Paper's got a point- is I'm responding to the will of the people.  People are gonna drink.  You know that, I know that, we all know that.  And all I do is act on that.  And all this talk of bootlegging-What is bootlegging?  On a boat it's bootlegging.  On Lakeshore Drive it's hospitality.  I'm a businessman." -Robert Di Nero as 'Al' Capone in "The Untouchables."  Man...I'd kill for an Italian guy.  [wink, wink] I've decided that I'm going to start getting in better shape.  I can do it...I just need to keep to it and not get distracted.  Pushups, situps, wieghts...running...the works.  My birthday is coming up...in a month and some days but it's still coming up.  I already have the list made out...w00t! Gangster movies up the wazoo! By the way, READ the Godfather.  The movie is great.  The book is AWESOME!  You know, I actually want to read it again.  I've never read a book twice before.  I'll be on vacation for my birthday.  It doesn't bother me that much, but I'd really like to spend my birthday at MY house, in MY bed.  I like getting phonecalls from my friends too, and what will I do without the internet??? Juuust kidding. So I'm in a little 'boy predicament' now.  To tell you the truth, I thought we were almost perfect for each other.  There's really no evidence to disprove that except for the fact that he's not going for me.  Oh well.  I really don't care anymore.  I'm fed up with competition.  Despite what many say...Love is not a game.  It's not.  If he wants me, I'm watching, I'm on the other bleachers.  It's his turn to get up off his ass. I'm taking a rest.  I stongly believe that, in life, absolutely everything happens for a reason.  It may take a second for you to realize why, it may take a year.  The important thing is that through the hardship you must trust. Always have faith.

       Damn it.&nbsp; I feel like a complete freshman again.&nbsp; At least in one aspect.&nbsp; So for two years I've been standing using the wrong posture and I only now did I realize how to fix it.&nbsp; For the past two years I just "took it like a man" and then had someone walk on it when I got back home.&nbsp; Let me tell ya- not very effective.&nbsp; So I've begun to fix it.&nbsp; It's hard to relearn something when you've been doing it one way for so long.&nbsp; Just like if you practice wrong, you're only enforcing bad habbits.&nbsp; So I found a way to fix it and ease the tention from my back.&nbsp; The new way hurts my arms like a summabitch.&nbsp; My arms have never really hurt in the history of my marching band career.&nbsp; Scary, eh?&nbsp; 5 hours of practice today.&nbsp; Last 5 minutes of rehearsal came and I pushed...and I shook violently.&nbsp; It wasn't mental anymore, I was physically stressed. That has never happened.&nbsp; I watched my horn angle fall 3 inches and believe me when I say there was nothing I could do to stop it.&nbsp; The tech came up to me and she knows that I'm concerned about how I perform..."your horn at-"   "i know."&nbsp;Being me, I wanted to cry because I was disappointed in myself.&nbsp; I am a section leader. That's not supposed to happen! Damn it, why?!?    &nbsp;  First year of band...was pushed but not hard.   Second year...pushed hard. I liked the intensity.    This year- Wow.&nbsp; pushed really hard.&nbsp; It's not something I can't handle...I need to work on it on my own.&nbsp; I know and I do and I will.&nbsp; To be honest- this activity has never made my muscles EVERYWHERE in my body sore...I have never trembled or shaken because of amounts of stress put on my body.&nbsp; And no-it's not overdoing it.&nbsp; I'm glad it's happening.&nbsp; I'm beginning to get in good shape.&nbsp; I love working and I love sweating.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I just haven't been coming home with that same confidence as last year.&nbsp; I need to push myself more mentally.&nbsp; The reason it's been hard is because I'm using my brain more than usual, being a leader.&nbsp; I don't just look out for myself now.&nbsp; That's just something I will have to compensate for, I will have to still push myself mentally more than I have been.&nbsp; I feel like I'm going downstairs instead of up.&nbsp; It's not a good feeling.&nbsp;I have to admit that marching for me was good today, on a personal level.&nbsp; It was soo nice.&nbsp; Maybe i'm just not as confident because I'm worried about the section more than I have ever been in the past years and I think about them instead of me when I get home.&nbsp; Maybe I'm straining my muscles by lifting and then going to band.&nbsp; Things like the listed I'm sure are 2%-10% of the problem.&nbsp; I must prepare myself mentally before I go to band.&nbsp; I know how effective attitudes can be.&nbsp; and you can make yourself believe anything.    &nbsp;  One more thing that's bugging me...   so one of our techs...came up to me today and I was standing&nbsp; too far away from splitting.&nbsp; And they just waved their hand at me, motioning to scoot back...right by my head...I didn't know what they meant or who&nbsp;they directed it towards...so then they told me to look and I looked at them...then they pointed towards the line and so I looked and I and another member were off. So the member moved up, then I moved up...and then I looked and we weren't in line at all...so we moved back.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but a simple "move back" would've done.&nbsp; I know I shouldn't be kind of ticked off but I am...I take it personally because I am a leader and I shouldn't have to be fixed and it's my own fault.&nbsp; I just feel like going up to the tech and saying "I'm sorry."&nbsp; I rememer last year lol...when I was really frustrated on the field...they asked me what the problem was...and I just let it all out...not yelling..I just let it out...and they told me to calm down...good call..but then nothing was done about the problem.&nbsp; I should've handled it better and I am mad at myself for that too.&nbsp; I don't like to let people down.&nbsp; Well, I'll show the tech that I mean business and that I don't need to be corrected anymore.&nbsp; Then we will come at a mutual level of respect and understanding.&nbsp; Did I mention they were sexist?&nbsp; One quiet comment that they don't think the masses heard, was heard by me and I didn't appreciate it.&nbsp; Oh well. Screw it, I'm out.    &nbsp;  -J

      I'm an idealist. I've spent much of my life dreaming and still do. It's not really a bad thing by any means but the thing is--I've often gotten used to being disappointed. Disappointment is, as we all know, not the best feeling in the world. I started growing numb to it. I never necessarily wanted to live in my dreams, but it was always fun to know that for about 10 hours I didn't have to worry or lift a finger. Don't get me wrong- I really looked forward to each day, even though I was a bit groggy in the morning. I love living. I love all the experiences-good and bad. I remember my friends telling me all these great stories. If I were smart I would never have compared myself to others and I would never have thought "why not me?" Believe me- I had my wonderful stories to tell, but never about boys. I wanted what other people had...that strange feeling, which I thought I knew, but was totally wrong. I chased after boys...it was like I was in kindergarten. "Jilly Pilly puddin' and pie, kissed the boys and made them cry...when the boys came out to play, Jilly Pilly ran away," my Uncle used to tease me when I was little. He was right. I didn't think twice about going up to some boy, especially in junior high, and ask them naively "will you 'go out' with me?" I thought that having a boyfriend was a part of life, and well that is semi-true, it's a part of life when it is meant to be. So then highschool came and I realized a lot of things about myself. I didn't chase after boys anymore. Frankly, I really didn't care. Then there were times I did. "Just stop looking Jill, and it'll happen." "Well, I trust your judgement...but say you lost your shoe...how is it going to come to you if you don't look for it?" and while that was sort of a logistic question to ask, it had absolutely nothing to do with the area that I was concerned about. So I stopped looking. I put my focus to a more constructive use. And sure- random thoughts would pop up in my head, but I didn't dwell on them. It was choice. Bad segue but oh well...I absolutely love drum corps. It's a grand passion of mine. And I'll even admit that I find corps boys a  bit  more attractive than non-corps boys...must be the pheromones in the sweat! haha. Moving on...so my school hosts a drum corps show and I went for the third time on June 29th. It was a great day. When it comes to corps...lol..I get a bit, ...well, GIDDY! It makes me so genuinely happy. I really wouldn't want to be anywhere else [except on the field myself, that is] For the first time, we had the Madison Scouts come, compete, and give a clinic. By no means am I a groupie. BY NO MEANS. I just love the Scouts, I have great admiration for them. Right...so they gave a clinic. Time came to mingle with the members and I didn't know any of the hornline so I just walked forward and talked to some random mello. We talked for about 10 minutes about nothing really...corps..school..mello brand..range...etc. Then we marched with them, haha, yup. The Scouts were co-ed for about 10 minutes. After the clinic, the Scouts changed and went meandering through the halls...my friend Hana and I went 'scouting' just for kicks...really to talk, but find some good looking guys and talk about how good looking they were. Couldn't find the hornline anywhere, so we went to Starbucks. My friend Kellie came up to me...she was so excited "Dude...some Madison Scouts just invited me and 'soandso' back to their busses after the show!" I told her it was awesome, but couldn't help but feel a little jealous. lol. Oh well. After Starbucks we came back, watched Joliet Kingsmen and then went 'scouting' once again. [Who could resist? wink wink] WE FOUND the hornline. They were actually set up in arcs, so Hana and I were just standing there like a couple of dorks. "Hi." we heard a voice and turned around. It was the kid that I met earlier at the clinic along with another member. "I'm sorry, what's your name again? I have to hear a name twice usually before I remember it." "Stan. And you are, again?" "Jill." "Hello." "Hi." and then there was some small talk...what it consisted of, I can't seem to recall. "Well, you should come back to the busses after the show." and I gladly accepted with a BIG, huge smile on my face. Then a staff member called his name and he was off running.  So, the show ended. I went with Kellie to the busses and waited around. The kid she met was there, and I was waiting. So Stan came and we said literally about 10 words to each other and then he was really silent while we were talking to the other kid that Kellie met. "Hey...you know..if you ever want to say something..go ahead..don't be afraid," I kidded him. But he shook his head no and I felt kind of bad. Somebody came up to him and they started walking off onto a path beside the school. I just kind of had that "Ohh...come ...back." look on my face. I was sad, I knew he wasn't going to come back...it was only a five minute thing...I still hoped though. and behold- he came back. My eyes lit up... "I have something for you." and his eyes lit up "So I scribbled this down on the back of my friends receipt...don't worry, I don't eat that much." "Haha. Thank you." I had given him my number and email, which I don't normally do...but I don't know..I just did. "Are you allowed to leave this area?" "You mean, the parking lot?" "Yeah." "Oh yeah." "Would you walk me back to the front, by my car?" "Sure." So, it was dark out, and it was nice. We walked side by side and talked, again, about random things. School, college, majors, and then I found out that we both aspired to march Vanguard. Awesome. We got to my car. I said "Thank You." and he hugged me good-bye. We knew each other for, let's see....an hour tops...and he hugged me. Yes, yes, he'd been on the road for a long time and still is and doesn't get any "action." But oddly enough, that wasn't it. It wasn't..."God, I've missed this." It was more like, "thanks for a good time. You're really nice and sweet." In my view anyways. It was a really nice hug. Nice and tight. I remember feeling his stubble against my face and at first I started to think "that's kind of harsh..." but it stopped at "that's kind..." and it changed to "that's kind of nice." "Well, goodbye and hopefully I'll talk to you soon" and he returned "yeah." My shirt smelled like Stan when I got home. I was so giddy that I could barely sleep. I remember not wanting to sleep in my shirt because I didn't want the smell to go away. So half an hour later I got a call from Kellie. "Where are you?" "...at home..." "When did you get home?" "About 15 minutes after I left you and Matt." "Well...they can't find Stan." At this I thought "shit" and then said "I swear, we didn't do anything" "Oh honey, I know I know. but do you know where he is?" "He went back right after he walked me to the car." "Alright. Well, I'm sure they'll find him." So for the rest of the night, I couldn't sleep because I thought I was responsible for making the Scouts short one person. I called her later and they still hadn't found him. Fantastic. It's a sign from God...nah. They found him, she told me the next day. I had talked to him later and apparently he was on the busses, they just didn't notice. A couple days went by, I didn't think he'd call. At band rehearsal i was found to be jumping up and down with excitement. He called. We could only talk for 6 minutes. And then two days went by and he called again, we talked for about half an hour. Then he called again...forty-five minutes...then I went on vacation and couldn't talk to really anyone because of roaming charges. I felt bad. There was this period where he didn't call me for about a week...I understood that he was busy. I just hoped that he would call so I knew he would. I emailed him one day. for the heck of it. Everybody likes getting mail, the good kind at least. haha. I was sick of not being able to talk to Stan while we were on vacation. So I went in the bathroom and pretended I was sick...15 minutes was good enough for me. He had a show anyways. I was glad I wasn't the first person to have to cut off. Our conversations are so much fun. There have been awkward pauses...but I just say something stupid so they're not awkward. We've gotten to know each other a lot better. It's been amazing. Ya'll know me. I make THE WORST jokes in the world, and so I'm told I make worse ones when I'm nervous. Doesn't surprise me. And what makes me want to shed a tear of joy is that Stan doesn't laugh out of sympathy. lol. If it was a horrible joke, he'll say "that was horrible" and then we'll laugh because it's true. I feel like I can tell him anything. We share stories a lot. Now, that's fun! He's SO funny. I love that. I don't laugh out of sympathy either. I got back from vacation and was SO glad...because I can talk to him whenever I want and for however long. Unfortunately I have missed a couple of his calls, but in the end it's okay because I like listening to his voice. So we had about a 2 hour conversation pseudo-recently..and here are three of the sweetest things he said: He was talking about not having any Madison shirts, besides the one that he wore to the clinic I was at. I really like that shirt, it's cool. So I told him that...and he's giving it to me. I feel kind of bad, but he told me not to... At the end of our conversation he told me that he wished he could see me. And he's actually kind of sick now. Yet, he still calls. He should be sleeping! I told him to get better and he told me "only if you write me more." And he told me that I could make him watch "The Notebook" if I watched "Fiddler on the Roof" with him.  So now...for Indi. I told Stan I'd meet him at the busses but that wasn't going to happen because I had to leave at 10:30. S0 I watched Phantom's show, and left to wander the halls looking for him at 10:21. No sight of Stan. There were Scouts walking about though. So I asked a random Scout if he knew Stan. "Kind of." So, I didn't bother.  Then Kellie and I romed around more, wasted more time, and then I finally asked another Scout. "Yes, I know him." "I'm really sorry to bother you, but I drove four hours up here, I need to see him, and I have 2 minutes until I have to leave." It was 10:28.  So the Scout told me to hang on a minute while he talked to his friends and then he went behind the blue curtain to find Stan.  Kellie and I waited.  It was 10:35.  Kellie turned to me, "Someone's coming.  I don't think it's him." So, I got excited for a second and then turned around just to make sure...and it was him. I was so excited that I just ran to him...I didn't care that it was in the middle of a hall. Screw other people, they were non-existant at that point. We hugged tightly for awhile.  I didn't care about time at that point, except I didn't want to make Stan late for anything. We couldn't talk for long.  He apologized for wearing his glasses because he has pinkeye. Which, the glasses didn't bother me, I liked them. I didn't care about the eye either.  All I knew is that I was happy to see him.  He asked me how the show was. It was a great deal more amazing than when I had seen it a month ago.  I was so proud of him.  I told him Kellie and I screamed for him.  "I'm really glad you came." "Me too." I honestly didn't think I'd get to see him.  It was 10:40.  We hugged goodbye.  I don't think either of us wanted to let go.  I kind of rubbed his back a little, which I didn't start thinking "I think he'd like that." I just did it...I didn't want him to go. He did the same to my back...Really I don't know who started first...That hug was just so nice.  The nicest hug I've ever had.  Nice and tight.  I could feel his heart beating through his uniform.  And...LOL...he looked VERY nice in uniform. Then, we let go.  I was indecisive in my head about what I was going to do...but I just let my heart to the talking...you know, shut off the brain.  I kissed him on the cheek.  Kellie said he looked at her and she was so happy for me that she had her hand over her mouth with the big "awwwwww" look.  I wasn't expecting anything...I was just in the mindset of thinking "I kissed you on the cheek!" And then he kissed my cheek.  It may seem little, but I was on cloud nine.  It was about 10:42...Kellie and I RAN...RAN out of the dome. Man...I really didn't want to leave.  I didn't think it was that bad...not seeing him for a month...I love talking to him...so, it makes it better...but then I saw him...and my eyes lit up...and I like seeing him.  I like seeing him a lot.  Kellie and I just looked at each other in the car and smirked...it was so funny.  We were both so 'giddy' that we laughed at anything.  So, while I was typing...Stan called. We talked for awhile and I felt bad because he had to bring all his stuff out with one hand as we talked.  He says he wants to make me watch a scary movie.  I don't think it's going to happen. lol.  I felt really stupid talking to him last night though. Just about a couple things that I said really.  So I've been writing him through the Scouts Summer Mail thing...and I signed one of the letters in Spanish...thinking he didn't know it I guess.  "Duermo Sonarlo"  which means 'I sleep to dream you'  and while it is a very sweet thing to say... I don't want him to think that I'm weird...just poetic. When he told me he figured it out i was like "No! No! You weren't supposed to!" lol.  He told me it was very nice...I still feel dumb though.  I also told him that I was writing in my journal... "What are you writing about?" "Oh...stuff...haha" "Ah." "Indi..." "Do you write about me in your journal?" "umm...yes..." "Really? What do you write?" "Words..." [I didn't know what to say.... for fear of embarrassing myself] "Oh.Okay."  And then I felt bad for not being able to tell him. "Well, I wrote about the first time we met" Yeah...I made that sound stupid, I know. "Do you want me to read it to you?" "If you want..."  I wanted to...but then again I didn't.  So I started reading the blog to him...and it's nothing "bad" in the beginning...really there's nothing bad...but you know what i mean? And then I guess I read really loud and my Dad heard me...it was 12am about "Jill go to bed! you woke me up!" To which I responded..."okay...sorry." and Stan laughed at me.lol...So I went back into my room.  I told him that I might read the rest later.  We talked more.  He was getting ready to load so he was talking to himself a little. "Sorry, I'm talking to myself." "Haha...don't worry about it. I was earlier, remember, when i put my away message up?" I was having difficulties so I was...yeah.. and then he went "Yeah...I was making fun of you.  Hope that's okay." lol. "Of course, I do it all the time."  I have these fifty pick up line cards...and I told him to pick a number.  He said 6.  So, I read him card number six.  "I'm not Fred Flinstone, but I bet I can make you Bed Rock."  He liked that one...lol. I wanted to read the rest...but he said that there really wasn't time...then he apologized for saying that and I knew why, I work the same way, but he didn't have to apologize.  So we were getting ready to say goodbye...and I hate doing that.  I know he'll call again...but i hate saying goodbye. It sucks.  He makes me turn into jelly even when he's not around.  I didn't think that that was possible, but know now it is.  I think he may know it...or maybe not...but there are things he says that absolutely make me melt.  It takes awhile for me to become coherent again lol. I hate saying goodbye.  You know...before i left on vacation I lost my shoe...just one shoe...and I couldn't find it for the life of me.  So, I stopped looking and it turned up. Literally.  And on the DCI show at my highschool...I [metaphorically, of course] found my shoe...that was not sought after.  I feel amazing.  My stomach is in knots. I'ver NEVER felt this way before.  It's like some fairy tale...honestly, who would've thought?  Things like this do not happen every day.  I mean..someone should start writing a book now! He makes me feel like I am a princess and when I'm in his arms...I mean yes, there are thoughts flying around rampantly but the two main thoughts are 'This feels incredible' and 'i never want to let go' I mean...after a bit my heart has calmed down and then I just want to fall asleep. There's no other place I would rather be [except marching Vanguard in about a year, but that's besides the point].  I don't know what else to say. He's the first person honestly to have the "power" to make me jelly, tie my stomach, and make me melt while he's both away and here. He told me to tell Kellie that he was sorry for not saying hi to her.  She responded 'seeing you both was happy enough.' :-)  I also told her about why I felt stupid..."Honey...I saw the way he acted around you at Indi...he LIKES you. He LIKES you for who you are." and I know that...and that makes me happy. I asked him to homecoming.  He said he'd love to go and that he would try his hardest to come.  I respect that, it's genuine.   He laughs at my jokes  and he makes fun of me...but that's a tell tale sign of 'this one's a keeper.'  Whenever I've gone to homecoming or twirp I've ALWAYS gone in a group..even if it was with a person I was interested in...going without a group would seem 'sacriligious.' in a sense, that is.  But with Stan...I mean...we can go in a group beforehand if he wants to...I don't care either way...but after...I just want it to be me and him.  He and I.  Watch movies in the dark...   He's so incredibly different and I love that.  ~Jill
