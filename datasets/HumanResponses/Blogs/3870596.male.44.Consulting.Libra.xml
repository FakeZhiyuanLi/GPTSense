One idea that would make me, the Board or Alaska InvestNet even more effective: Use Rickover Agendas to make tracking Board actions and projects easier. Admiral Rickover, builder of the modern U.S. nuclear navy hated inefficient meetings. He used the following agenda format and would fill the agenda out as the meeting progressed. At the end of the meeting. Presto! Instant minutes and a tracking document.  Format:  Decision                      Y/N    Who     By When 1. To do xyz                   Y     Tim      July 9 2.

        DOES EDUCATION AND SCHOOL QUALITY AFFECT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT? In their most recent publication, the Knowledge Works Foundation (KWF) discusses the relationship between education and economic prosperity.  The paper cites research from the Brookings Institution and noted education policy authors attributing the U.S.â€™s success as a knowledge-based economy to a relatively well-educated workforce.  The research also extends the relationship between education and prosperity to state and local economies.  In a study of school districts with court-mandated public school funding, increases in education spending immediately raised real estate values.  In addition, cities with a well-educated workforce and strong public school system during the last decade were the areas to experience the greatest amount of population and income growth.   urlLink View the paper online.   Source:  urlLink Southern Compass newsletter, July 6, 2004    A good collection of evidence that a well-educated workforce is related to success as a knowledge-based economy -- just in case one ever needs it.

       5/15 Report   Accomplishments this week:  --held a Governance Board meeting on Wednesday, June 30 at Steve Mahoney's home and all the board members made it -- in person or by teleconference --got caught up on AIN Board business with Rick, Steve, Katie, Bruce and Allan --had lunch with Allan on Friday, July 2nd and covered the waterfront with brainstorming   My morale:  (5 high and 1 low) 5, hey things are starting to roll with Alaska InvestNet!   One idea that would make me, the Board or Alaska InvestNet even more effective:  I thought of starting to write weekly 5/15 reports as Board Chair to keep in touch with everyone. (5/15's take 15 minutes to write and 5 minutes to read and follow this format here. They list accomplishments for the past week. They're an invention of Yvon Chouinard, the owner of the Patagonia clothing company to keep in touch with his managers.) Allan suggested putting it on a weblog.
