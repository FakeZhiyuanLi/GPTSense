       Lee Harris on Saddam's Capture:  Thank God He's Alive    But there is another reason to be thankful that Saddam Hussein is alive. The man who called upon his countrymen and fellow Muslims to sacrifice their own lives in suicide attacks, to blow themselves to bits in order to glorify his name, failed to follow his own instructions. He refused the grand opportunity of a martyr's death, or even that of the hardened Hollywood gangster, determined that the cops would never take him alive. Instead, Saddam Hussein surrendered meekly and was, according to the reports, even cooperative.  We took Saddam Hussein alive, and, in doing this, we have done a great deal more than simply knock down a statue of a dictator -- we have vanquished a collective nightmare. We have turned the light on a bogey-man, and revealed him to be a broken old man, hiding fearfully in a six by eight hole.   Read the whole thing.

         "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him," U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer told a news conference. "The tyrant is a prisoner."  Unless you've been living in a hole in the ground, you probably know by now that Saddam Hussein has been captured alive in.. well, a hole in the ground. It's about [insert four letter word + ing] time.  It makes me wonder though if this will stop or even decrease the guerrilla attacks. The US thought they would get better after Qusai and Odai were killed, but they had the reverse effect. Perhaps this just gives the guerilla campaign more reason to fight?  But regardless of that, this is obviously a victory for the US, England (or perhaps just Blair), and the Iraqi masses.  "I'm very happy for the Iraqi people. Life is going to be safer now," said 35-year-old Yehya Hassan, a resident of Baghdad. "Now we can start a new beginning."

A few people have said that they would never  ever  eat these... even after I said how good they are. But I swear, they taste good.  It's like double stuffed. But half of it tastes like thin mints. THIN MINTS! How can you pass this up?! The cookies which taste like heaven but you can only get once a year (except off of  urlLink eBay  of course).

       It was a late start this morning, and yet I woke up at 7am to the sound of the ground rumbling. I was laying in bed, and the ground was shaking. I wish I was kidding.  They were working on  urlLink Ball Road --I guess. Some wise guy came up with this lovely contraption which breaks up concrete by using a heavy weight which is repeatedly lifted and then dropped back onto the ground every 10 seconds. Slamming it. Hard.  What a way to wake up... to what sounds like the end of the world.

       i went with my brother to UCI early this morning to help out in the homeless outreach thing. it was awesome. the group made bagged lunches w/ sandwiches, chips, bananas, and water. five cars were filled with food and college students (haha, i think i was the youngest one there).  we drove to LA and there was this street there that was filled with homeless people. :( and we started giving out the food. i should have known that it wasn't gonna be kicked back and chill when they went over the safety instructions. (driver has to stay in the driver's seat the whole time; if anything happens.. like a riot... you should get back into the car right away and drive off)  soon after we started giving out food, we were crowded by A LOT of people.  you don't realize how lucky you are until you do something like this. and while it was an awkward situation (and probably not the most safe one), I'm really glad that i did it. it's so different from volunteering at a place like a soup kitchen.  we had to save half the food for a different part of the street. our car didn't have too hard of a time with this, because we could just close the trunk and get back into the car. but the car in front of us was an SUV, so you could like see all the food, even when they closed the back, so some people really got mad knowing that there was more food and we couldn't give them any. i'm really glad that didn't get violent. some of the people stuffed the bags into their jackets that they got from a different car and tried to get another bag from a different car.  at the 2nd part of the street, we ran out of food. at first it was slow, but then there ended up being A LONG line of people just as the food was running low. we ended up giving out the muffins that we were going to eat for lunch too. there was this little girl that was in the line. she was 5th in line when we ran out of food. :(  it was so awesome seeing the smiles on some of these people's faces. when we drove off, people all over the street had our bags. a lot of them smiled and waved as we drove away.  one lady was like,"thank you. jesus loves you," as we handed her a bag of food.

       I didn't think I'd blog again.. or at least not for a couple months. But I guess now is a better time than any. Yesterday was the end of the semester, and I wasn't happy with my grades.  This semester was different because I really worked my ass off to do the best I could. I stopped copying massive amounts of homework assignments. I did my work, or at least as much as I could in the time that I had. I learned this semester, that I couldn't make the cut. And I won't survive much longer.  The way Oxford works is whack, and it took me years to figure out exactly how things are. In 7th grade, you start out with what are suppose to be 200 of the smartest people in the district. As every year, every semester, goes by, people get kicked out of the school. These are the people who are "not as smart," and couldn't meet the 3.0 requirement. By junior year, you end up with only the people who in jr high had straight a's and awesome grades. Everyone else, by now, is long gone. You're left with a group that is supposedly the best of the best because the worst of the best were forced to leave, and while I used to be near the top of the bell curve, I'm now left near the bottom.  Sure I could graduate at Oxford, but with what? The pride of knowing that I survived six years of hardships? With a mediocre GPA which will get me into a college that I don't want to be at--A college where my SAT score is 300 points higher than the school's average. But I'm there because I couldn't get a GPA to match it.  Oxford has a problem that as soon as students fall into hard time, the school turns their backs on them. Instead of truly helping them to catch up, the school recommends that you go to another school. The school recommends that you lessen your workload and take some "regular" classes at another school. The school which is suppose to prepare you for college forces you to go some else and it closes a door behind you after you leave.  I don't know how much more of this I would be able to take. Every semester, I have to constantly worry about if I'll be at the school in a couple months. I have to worry about keeping my grades up.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of being a guinea pig so that the school can find out how to create the "perfect" school.  Face it, Oxford looks good on paper, but how well does the school actually work?  Sure we have high test scores: we kick out anyone that can't keep up.  It used to be a matter of finishing what I started.  I'd gone this far, why give up now?  But have I really succeeded if I finish with a GPA that I'm not proud of?  How much is Oxford really a college prep school if its seniors can't get into the colleges they want to?  Thank you to everyone else who is leaving this semester or is planning to leave at the end of the year.  And there are tons of you.  Someone else called it The Great Walkout.  Thank you for making me realize that I can leave, and I don't have to put up with this.  Oxford is not the best; we're a poor excuse for a high school, and we don't have to have our college admissions, our careers fucked because our high school's system doesn't work.  I'm done.  I've realized that I can do better, I can go elsewhere.  I don't have to put up with the stuff that Oxford students always complain about.  I don't have to struggle through everything I do because Oxford is still trying to figure out how it wants to run its school.  I don't have to put up with the empty promises of a gym and new classrooms.  Good bye Oxford.  Cuz dude, I'm a Centurion now.

       First-year students at Medical School were receiving their first anatomy class with a real dead human body. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a white sheet.  The professor started the class by telling them in medicine, it is necessary to have 2 important qualities as a doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the human body."  As an example, the Professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the corpse, withdrew it and stuck it in his mouth.  Go ahead and do the same thing," he told his students. The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually (because they wanted to pass the course)took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead body and sucking on it.  When everyone finished, the Professor looked at them and told them the second most important quality is observation. "I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention."  urlLink (Courtesy of John)

       i've quickly learned at while running with cypress, many things are different on the road.  you don't get yelled at by passing cars (as often). little--but deadly--objects such as pennies and nickels aren't thrown at you. and little lexington kids don't yell at you, throw rocks at you and such. haha.  the funny thing about running past lexington with the oxford team is that every 8th grade boy you run past automatically assumes that since you're at oxford, you're also a 8th grade boy. little do they realize that many of us are like 3+ years older. one of these days, one of them is gonna get hurt.  well, off to bed. practice tomorrow at 9am. woohoo.

       okay. so cypress' distance team. every year since forever and a half ago, oa coaches have gone by distance. so it'll be like, go out and do 6 miles.  cypress... they're different. not bad, not good. but different. and it's screwing with my head. they go by time. so instead, you'd be going out and doing like 40 minutes. run faster, run slower--doesn't matter. the time isn't going to be going any faster.  so since i'm not part of running club (ahaha, running club... it's so damn shaddy, but it's brilliant), i just did 25 minutes on my own today (25 minutes on your own seems like a hell of a lot longer), plus about 1/2 mile warmup and 1/2 mile cooldown (lol, i'm reforming, but not that fast).  this is changing the whole concept of running. but i guess it makes sense. it's not suppose to be the distance from point a to point b that matters: it's the journey you take to get there.  it explains a lot though. over the summer, oa had practice the same time cypress did in the morning. once we ran into one of the cypress cc runners, and we asked how much they were running... only to calmly recieve the answer "twenty." hehe.

       As practice was finishing up today, Coach was telling everyone what events they are going to be running at the meet tomorrow against Loara.  As he said my name, he noted that he "needed to talk to me about my racing."  So I walked up to him a little bit later.  I thought for sure that he was going to tell me I was going out too damn fast... because the last few races, I've been going out pretty fast.  Nope.  "Vince, tomorrow in the 800, if you're leading the race again... do something three feet from the line." "You want me to fall?" "Yea." "Umm.. okay.  I can fall."  So since I just transferred to Cypress, I'm not allowed to run Varsity.  Since I'm a junior, I'm not allowed to run Frosh/Soph. But I run Frosh/Soph anyway... and I fall.

I thought i did really really bad in mile, but turns out i only did bad. in 800 i did really well considering i haven't been training as long as everyone else. i have still yet to catch up to my PRs from last season (i'm about 20 seconds off)..but i'll get there soon.  ohh, on the way to the meet, the two buses from chs got lost and like this bus from another school started following us! so we like faked them out by pretending we were going to make a turn and then going straight instead.. coach eyman was like "quick! ditch them at the light!" haha. it was funny... like racing buses.  i'm gonna go eat some food and hop in bed/pass out.

        gmail me    i woke up this morning to find not one, but two invitations for a beta  urlLink gmail  account today. thanks sandy ko & jason shellen (if you havent heard by now, gmail is google's email service)  what makes gmail so different? first off, they don't give you 4 megabytes like yahoo or 2 megabytes like hotmail, gmail gives you a lovely 1000 megabytes (1gb) of space.  aside from that, theres a lot of other cool features. one of them is plus addressing, which lets you use username+anything@gmail.com. useful for signing up for services because as soon as you get spam for that address, you can set a filter to send all the email from that address to your trash automatically.  gmail groups your emails in coversations so that your replies w/ someone are all on the same page, and theres a handy reply box on the bottom of each conversation. let's see, composing emails. gmail has one of the best spell checkers online. this thing is FAST and i'd say is almost up to par with microsoft word's spell checker.  and of course, since it is google, you can search through ALL of your emails with pretty good accuracy. if i were yahoo or microsoft, i'd be scared. because even aside from the massive amounts of storage space, google still has yet to roll out all the planned features. and the current features are enough to beat out other webmail services.

        Air Marshal Leaves Gun in Airport Restroom   CHICAGO (Reuters) - A federal air marshal accidentally left her gun in a restroom beyond the security checkpoints at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, officials say.  The weapon was discovered by a passenger who alerted an airline employee.  The marshal remained on the job after Thursday's incident when she visited an airport restroom and inadvertently left her gun behind, Dave Adams, spokesman for the Federal Air Marshal Service in Washington, said Saturday.  The restroom was beyond security checkpoints, airport spokeswoman Pat Smith said. So the risk was that someone could have discovered the gun and taken it on a flight.  urlLink Read More...

       The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for i know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now i have told you."  So the women hurried away form the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and  worshiped  him.  - Matthew 28:5-9 (Scripture courtesy of Lindsay H.)

BOO to HW!!! >:o" "get 10 pages done by 11!! join me and eugene in our efforts!! :-)" "doing my homework.. leave a message or call the cell" "dont u wish u were doing something as fun as I am? [smirk] :-!" "9/15 pgs done!" "today's homework load is nucking futs!"   Oh yea. I ran 5:15 today for mile.. on four hours of sleep! Not too shabby. Four hours of sleep due to the four tests I had today.

       at first when i saw william hung, american idol reject, i was embarassed. i was ashamed that an asian, who falls into every stereotype possible, was being shown on a regular basis in commercials where after his audition, he would state, "I have no professional training."  Then i got to the point where i realized that he was just being himself. its not that he tried to make asians look that way, its really who he is. at this point, i was like "hmm.. go him for making some money off of this."  then i saw  urlLink this  article. based on what is in the article--i can now conclude that william hung is beyond arrogant. his new found fame has turned him into an extremely cocky person. when will he realize that he is famous because he is easy to laugh at? this is a joke that has gone on for way too long.  it needs to stop. but it's tough when the butt of the jokes is so willing.  quotes from the article:   William Hung blew me off the first time I tried to get an interview.  The University of California-Berkeley student and pop icon, who is best known for singing a rendition of ``She Bangs'' before being ejected from ``American Idol,'' had in his mind become big enough to bark:  ``Everybody wants a piece of me now. . . . I'm not interested.''  Just a day earlier, chart-topper Twista had given me 30 minutes. I couldn't believe Hung could be that full of himself.  [...]  Recently Hung has been on the other end, doing the criticizing. He's a judge for ``Cal Idol,'' Berkeley's version of ``American Idol.'' According to some contestants, he can be harsh. But he says he's nothing like the television judges -- Paula Abdul, Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson. ``I'm objective. They're not always objective. I'm always objective.''  [...]  One girl walks up and hugs him, but it's hard to tell if she's a friend. She's a former dorm-mate from freshman year at Clark Kerr dormitory, and she tells a story of how Hung criticized her. The girl, who also sings, said he had the gall to tell her that on a scale of good to bad music, ``Elton John is here, he would be next, then Britney, and on the other end would be me.''

       Congress.org:  urlLink http://www.congress.org/congressorg/issu...   The Draft will Start in June 2005  There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S 89 and HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin at early as Spring 2005 -- just after the 2004 presidential election. The administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the public's attention is on the elections, so our action on this is needed immediately.  $28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective Service System (SSS) budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005. Selective Service must report to Bush on March 31, 2005 that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, is ready for activation.  Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and HR 163 forward this year, entitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003, "to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes." These active bills currently sit in the committee on armed services.

         urlLink SignOnSanDiego.com > News > State -- Assembly OKs $1 increase in minimum wage   SACRAMENTO – California's minimum wage would climb to $7.75 an hour under legislation that was approved by the state Assembly on Wednesday, an increase supporters said would still leave roughly 1 million workers with poverty-level pay.   The measure by Assemblywoman Sally Lieber, D-Santa Clara, would raise the wage from $6.75 to $7.25 an hour starting Jan. 1, 2005, and to $7.75 on Jan. 1, 2006.  It was sent to the Senate by a 45-29 vote.  The bill's supporters said the other West Coast states have higher minimum wages than California and the minimum wages in Oregon and Washington increase with inflation. California's minimum wage would have to be $8.92 an hour if it were tied to the cost of living.  Washington's minimum wage is $7.16, Alaska's is $7.15 and Oregon's is $7.05. The federal minimum wage is $5.15 an hour.  "You try to live on $6.75 an hour, even $7 or $8 an hour," said one of the bill's supporters, Assemblyman Manny Diaz, D-San Jose. "In my (district) nobody can live on anything less than $15 an hour. That's why many wage earners have two jobs."  Good news for a lot of teen workers. Looks like minimum wage might go up soon...

       (courtesy of  urlLink john )  A German couple who visited an infertility clinic after eight years of marriage to discover why they couldn't conceive were dumbfounded when told that they just needed to have sex, reports The Sun. Both the husband, 36, and his 30-year-old wife were raised in strict religious households and had no idea how to have sex. "When we asked them how often they had sex, they looked blank and said 'What do you mean?'" said a spokesman at the University Clinic of Lubek. "[They] were simply unaware?of the physical requirements necessary to procreate." The clinic offered the couple sex-therapy lessons and is now conducting a study to find other people with a similar lack of sex education.   Sometimes you feel like an orgasm, sometimes you?wait, who doesn't feel like an orgasm? Soon you may get more bang for your buck when you buy new chocolate bars containing high levels of chemicals similar to those the body releases when sexually aroused, reports The Sun . The chocolate bars currently on sale in Britain contain 660 milligrams of phenyl ethylamine, which is related to dopamine and adrenaline ? natural chemicals that heighten bodily sensations and thus allow for easier orgasm. Testers reported orgasm-like highs from eating the chocolate. Consequently, new bars hitting the market soon will contain even more of the synthetic chemical.

        The New York Times: Coutesy of  urlLink John    urlLink The Bionic Running Shoe   PORTLAND, Ore. --  SHOES have long been sensible. Now some are getting smart.  Smart enough, that is, to sense their environment electronically, calculate how best to perform in it, and then instantly alter their physical properties to adapt to that environment. In short, the designers say, shoes that can do whatever is needed to deliver improved athletic performance or just a better experience in the ancient poetry of feet striking the earth.  "The whole concept of an intelligent shoe would be great," said Christian DiBenedetto, a scientist here at the North American headquarters of Adidas. "Something that would change to your different needs during a marathon, or whatever you were doing, was always the fantasy."  Adidas, the 83-year-old German sporting-goods maker, is about to turn that fantasy into biomechanical reality in the form of a running shoe for men and women. Sleek and lightweight despite its battery-powered sensor, microprocessor and electric motor, the shoe, named 1, is expected to be in stores by December and will cost $250.  Adidas executives say the shoe is no gadget-dependent gimmick. Instead, its designers say it represents a leap forward in wearable technology. Each second, a sensor in the heel can take up to 20,000 readings and the embedded electronic brain can make 10,000 calculations, directing a tiny electric motor to change the shoe. The goal is to make the shoe adjust to changing conditions and the runner's particular style while in use.

        Reuters:  urlLink BMW drivers get most sex    BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW drivers have more sex than owners of any other cars and are much more active than Porsche drivers, a new German car magazine has found. The German magazine &quot;Men's Car&quot; found in a survey of 2,253 motorists aged 20 to 50 published in its inaugural May issue that male BMW drivers say they have sex on average 2.2 times each week while Porsche drivers have sex 1.4 times per week.  Following BMW drivers were Audi (2.1), Volkswagen (1.9), Ford (1.7) and Mercedes (1.6). Drivers of foreign car makes were also behind BMW with Italian cars (2.0), French (1.9), Japanese (1.8), Swedish (1.6) and Korean cars (1.5) trailing after.    Among women, French car drivers were top with 2.1 times per week followed by Audi (2.0), Italian (2.0), and BMW (1.9) with Porsche again at the bottom of the scale at 1.2 times per week.    (well, there's one more reason to want a BMW...)

       i was on my way home today when i passed by a mobile home place and i saw a woman on the ground in the driveway. by instinct now, i went over there and pulled some gloves out of my fanny pack (which i still had on because i just got off work) and put them on. she was an 84-year-old who had fallen while going over the speed bump. by the time i got there, there were a few others around. i called 911 and waiting for the firefighters and paramedic to show up. (ever call 911 and get a busy signal? yea.. not so fun). when they showed up, they put her on a backboard and headed off to the hospital to get an xray. i didnt do much, but hey, all the better. just weird, because this is what i'm looking for for the entire day and nothing happened in the park today... but the second i get off.  on another note. where ever you are in soak city, chances are a lifeguard can see you. we're stationed in a way so that atleast one (if not more) lifeguards can see almost every guest within 10 seconds. so don't come to the park and do something stupid with your girlfriend/boyfriend. c'mon! it's a family park!   PG-Rated Story:  someone told me about a time once when a 13 year old boy was laying on top of a girl on one of the purple tubes (can fit two people) in the river. so the lifeguard says "can you please not do that, this is a family park." to which he replies to her, "i'm trying to start a family here!"   (edit: someone complained that the story above is not G-rated... so i've upgraded it to PG. :) )

       the bonfire tonight was a get together w/ a bunch of soak city employees and some of their friends. i brought greg w/ me... anyway. so we show up at the bonfire and greg's cousin just happens to be there (he goes to cypress and eats lunch w/ one of the groups i hang out with at lunch). small world. then cody (used to go to oxford, but got kicked out for grades) shows up. small world. then jocelyn shows up! woah. small world.  work bonfire, but atleast 7 people i know from other places were there.. it was weird. cody kept on putting lighter fluid into the fire, i thought for sure someone was going to get burned.  all in all, a pretty good night. quite a few guards showed up (maybe like 10ish). not too shabby for something thrown together at the last minute.

       why people go to water parks on days like today is beyond me. it's cold, windy, and wet. but i guess its find by me since that's where the money for my paycheck comes from.  on weekends we have insane numbers of guards scheduled to work (you almost never get a weekend off and i heard that there were over 150 of us..with more being trained this weekend). so today, as usual--it being a weekend and all--there were lots of guards. but its cold. so theres not as many guests. on top of that, we had to shut down the river today. i guess it's a state law that if a dead animal is found in the water, you have to shut down the attraction for the day. today, a bird was found. so all the guards that would have been on the river.. were not on the river.  also, while i was at gremmie lagoon (little kid water playground), there was an AFR (accidental fecal release). we called a supervisor who came, confirmed it was uhh.. feces, and told us to clear the pool. so at one point, gremmie and the river were both shut down.  i must have the worst luck because i ended up in the crappiest places on the rotation. i did river twice (then the river got shutdown), then gremmie (which then go shut down, but promptly reopened) and fun house rover FOUR times--totalling probably over 3 and a half hours. the fun house is basically like a house full of different things that squirt, leak, or splash water. but the rover has to walk through the thing over and over again while kids try to get you wet--not so fun on a cold day. hehe. what i would give to have been put on the top of a slide today.  hopefully it'll be sunny tomorrow. :)

       some kid today lost his prescription goggles in the river. i didn't even know they made prescription goggles.  on my way home, i was waiting for a bus on the corner of beach and ball (uhg, i hate that corner). anyway, there was a lady standing on the curb, and i walked inbetween her and the bench. she pushed me. i fell. and she yelled "MOVE!!" i think she thought i was trying to steal her ugly green purse which was sitting on the bench. which is odd, because she had another purse hanging over her shoulder.  oh sure, i'm gonna steal from someone when i'm wearing red shorts, a bright red jacket that says lifeguard on it, a lifeguard hat, and a nametag. gee. i'd be real hard to find.

       i already shut down a ride. one of the guests pulled his biceps femoris while i was on stand on the bottom of banzai (six lane slide w/ mats). i was waiting for him to walk out of his lane, but i just saw him laying on his side holding his leg.  i just thought, "aww crap." went to go help him, picked up the phone and called for help while the top guard started clearing the lines. within a minute, the two top dogs in the park arrived along with about four supervisors. super quick response. still not sure how you can pull a muscle on the slide..but i guess it's possible.  fun day. oh yea, it was really cold today and cloudy and gloomy. not very good waterpark weather.. or summer weather for that matter.

        so after thirty-something hours of training, today was my first day on stand. did river a, top of banzai slides, river h, and then exit area for stormwatch. it's a lot of fun. :) definitely more tiring than you would think though.  i have about three or four blisters on my feet. they hurt a lot, but everyone says that'll stop after a week or so.  today i got 136 high fives. (yes, i counted--it's national high five day at soak city.. so its a competition w/ the guards)

       i'm not sure why i havent blogged at all..but here it goes.  bluish -  urlLink bluish  is really starting to take off now. we have two jr high dances lined up in the next week. one on friday night and another one next wednesday night. scooore! kickin' it at jr. high dances!  soak city - i had department stuff on wednesday night. start this weekend. yaah! sat 9-2, sun 11-4. a lot of the guards are gonna be going to knotts on sat after our shift. so i guess that's where i'll be. part of the S.E.A.L.S. (serving everyone and loving self) motto is "I rock. I am the bomb. I am extremely good looking." it's in our lifeguard manual. i'm not kidding.  physics boat race - we spent waaay too much money on our boat. but it turned out really dope. our team name was "Yo Ho!" because freeman didn't like "Freeman's Seamen"..although he was laughing at it for about five minutes. we made it into finals and during finals, we were half way there and were in second place but we just said screw it and abandoned ship because we didnt think we could catch up. :)  finals - suck as usual. last one is the second half of my math final tomorrow. its EASY as hell, but the thing that sucks is that theres NOT ENOUGH time to finish it! i swear, its sooo easy. but theres way too many questions in the time period that we have to finish it. so everyone ends up having to guess because they dont have time to do them all. and i'm not even doing half of them, i'm just plugging in the answers back into the question and checking them on my calculator.. i couldn't imagine actually working all of them out.

Like free AOL Broadband for 45 days (which u'll cancel in 44 days) or sign up for an ebay account and place a bid (that u'll kno u'll lose). Then u get 5 people to do the same thing. And then they send ya a free 20gb ipod (4th generation) or an iPod mini (color of your choice). one  of my friend got one, and online forums are buzzing with people who have gotten one too. Supposedly, it's legit. Worth a try I think. Click here for the link!

       Reuters:  urlLink Bigger Breasts for Free: Join the Army   The U.S. Army has long lured recruits with the slogan "Be All You Can Be," but now soldiers and their families can receive plastic surgery, including breast enlargements, on the taxpayers' dime.  The New Yorker magazine reports in its July 26th edition that members of all four branches of the U.S. military can get face-lifts, breast enlargements, liposuction and nose jobs for free -- something the military says helps surgeons practice their skills.  "Anyone wearing a uniform is eligible," Dr. Bob Lyons, chief of plastic surgery at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio told the magazine, which said soldiers needed the approval of their commanding officers to get the time off.  Between 2000 and 2003, military doctors performed 496 breast enlargements and 1,361 liposuction surgeries on soldiers and their dependents, the magazine said.  The magazine quoted an Army spokeswoman as saying, "the surgeons have to have someone to practice on."

       A woman in a hot air balloon realized she was lost. She lowered her altitude and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, “Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don’t know where I am.”  The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, “You’re in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level. You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude.”  She rolled her eyes and said, “You must be a Democrat.”  “I am,” replied the man. “How did you know?”  “Well,” answered the balloonist, “everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to do with your information, and I’m still lost. Frankly, you’ve not been much help to me.”  The man smiled and responded, “You must be a Republican.”  “I am,” replied the balloonist. “How did you know?”  “Well,” said the man, “you don’t know where you are or where you’re going. You’ve risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You’re in exactly the same position you were in before we met but, somehow, now it’s my fault.”

       so tonight my brother and i spent the evening modifying safe and sane fireworks to make them a little more fun. we had a pretty big group go over to the kmart parking lot. good times... lighting off modified piccolo petes and a few special fireworks that todd brought.   jocelyn showed up tonight, and i'm now convinced that she knows everyone in the world... because this is the second time that ive run into her this summer in a random place (first time was at a soak city bonfire).  then all the sudden a car pulls up and stops. both doors opened at the same time (it was at this point that everyone mumbled something along the lines of "oh shit.."). it was an unmarked buena park police car.  they started questioning ben, christina, and todd. ben said that all  he had were piccolo petes and mad dog fountains and boldly asked for his ID back (and it was true, that's all he had with him). so ben and christina came back to our group. but half hour latter, a freakin paddy wagon pulls up. police van with a steal cage in the back.. the works. they handcuffed todd and took him downtowm for fingerprinting and gave him a $1200 fine and a misdemeanor.  then josh and kyle followed the paddywagon to the station (where we found out that modifying legal fireworks is a felony) and the rest of us headed over to jocelyn's house to light off the rest of the fireworks before midnight and get some grub.  during this whole thing, i did snap a couple pics with my camera phone and i pulled out our bluish camera, which can take pictures better at night. phone picture is on the  urlLink photoblog . the other picture--the better one--will be posted later. also, here's  urlLink ben's blog , and i'm sure  urlLink john's blog  will have something by tomorrow.

       inservice is basically re-training to make sure that you still know your stuff. the worst part of it is the warm ups >.  so what's the best way to warmup? i forgot what they're called..but we have to do this thing that's like football drills. you know where you run in place and someone blows a whistle and then you gotta do a pushup. well we do those... except we do them on the beach of the wavepool in just a swimsuit. so everytime you do a pushup, you get completely submerged in water and it's freezing because the water is cold and the windy breezes that come by are enough to send chills down your spine..  pure torture.  we also played intertube h2o polo this morning. it's sooo much fun! think waterpolo but while sitting in intertubes. it was yellow intertubes vs. clear and orange intertubes. our team won. i got an assist. :)
