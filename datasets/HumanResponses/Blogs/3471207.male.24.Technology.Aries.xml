      The reason is because joel needed help in changing the bg color of his blog. I can't believe i even started this but what the heck, i'm a computing student and i'm curious whether the color can be changed. So that's basically it. Also, he thinks i'm a godsend..this and for other reasons..hahhaa.

      Ok let's start with the BreAkIng NEWs. Power supply blackout in parts of Singapore. At 1015pm i was on my computer with a direct connection to the power supply and with my cable modem on. Was chatting with some people online and working on the website and reading a blog and halfway into it, the lights went off, my notebook switched off and everything was black. Immediately, i looked to my window to check if the other block was hit. Yup, it was. And i then went to the balcony window to see whether my neighborhood was affected too. Yup. I took in the scene. It was soooo amazing and awesome. Come on, how many times do you experience such a major blackout in Singapore? Even the street lamps were shut off and the only light i saw for the first part were from the vehicles down below and some isolated light in the distance. Then slowly, i started to see dots of light appear in random units in the opposite blocks. People were lighting their candles and turning on their torch lights. I tried to take a photo of the whole neighborhood but it was in vain..all i got was a black photo..hahha..guess i have to get a better camera or change some settings. Anyway, it was almost as if the end of the world was here. Well, at least a glimpse of what would happen. Then i went online using my dialup and notebook battery. Thankfully i still have a backup internet line..haha. And i checked to see whether it was an isolated event or a national catastrophe. nope. it just affected some parts of singapore. Ok, so it's not that much of a catastrophe..thoughts of the possibility of terrorists being the mastermind came up. Well, as i've said, this is just a small glimpse of what would really happen when God comes again the second time to earth. All eye will see him and he will be accompanied with tens of thousands of angels.  Apart from the blackout, today was quite a fulfilling day too. I had chance to learn more of php web programming language and do some debugging. I was stuck in how to configure the emailing feature from the website. I realised that the saying "you learn best when you struggle" holds true. I did learn alot today. Anyway, Joel wanted the song "Searching" by Joe Satriani so i sent it to him. Earlier i had sent him a song by Steve Vai. I wonder why he didn't like it.hehe. Anyway, today doesn't sound of much activity, tomorrow is going to be a busy day for me. In fact, wednesday nights seem to be the hottest day and time of the week. I have friends playing tennis on wednesdays and i can't go because i have to give bible study to Andrew on wednesdays. Furthermore, for this week, we have a meeting this wednesday night to discuss the young adult ministry with pastor. And lastly, i was supposed to check with one of the voice of prophecy correspondence course gradute whether she was free for us to visit her on wed night to pass her the certificate of completion personally. Oh well, i decided there was only one way to solve this. I decided to bring my bible study earlier, probably late afternoon and then i'll go to the meeting at night. As for the tennis, i have to forgo it and have been forgoing it all this while. For the visit, i'll arrange to meet on saturday afternoon instead. Hai..so many things to do even when i'm unemployed. I can't believe how i'll survive if i was employed.   Another thing is, while i was doing the website halfway, my friend suddenly msned me and asked for help. She seemed desperate so i had to help her. She was in paris and lost her luggage when she was trying to get off the train. She had a huge bag and a hand carried one with the laptop inside. So when she tried to get off the train, she put the handcarried one on the platform and then swung back to get the huge luggage. unfortunately, the door closed too fast and she and her big luggage were stuck in the train with the hand carried bag outside. Oh well, not only was her laptop in there but her demand draft was there. It's like a cheque. So i helped her call UOB to check if anybody else could cash in the cheque. Thankfully only she could cash it in. So that's not so bad..now the only worry is the laptop. Anyway, hope things will get better.

      Was quite a fulfilling day today. In the morning i went to school to collect my graduation gown. Was with Jeffrey over there since he wanted to borrow some money from me. I also met my army friend outside the entrance with his friends and it wasn't his scheduled time to collect but i told him he could. So he went in to collect too. Found out that the gown that i ordered was too short. I did try on the gown before i ordered and the lady said it was fine. But when i looked at it again, it wasn't fine..it was too short! BUT thankfully, my army friend's gown was too long for him..it almost sweeped the floor. And thank God an idea popped into our minds. Why not switch? Yup, we did and lo and behold, our exchanged gowns fit us perfectly! I was happy and he was happy. lalalala.  Met some of my other friends over there and i realised that besides the gown collection, i ended up ordering a plaque. It is a silver plaque with wooden backing suitable to be hung on the wall. Had a hard time deciding on which backing to take as the acrylic one looked neat and elegant looking. Ended up with the wooden one since it fits my wall better. I also found out that another friend of mine could play tennis. Been trying to find tennis partners and my friend could play! Somehow i sensed that she knew how to play. That was interesting. Somehow, people who play tennis have that tennis look. It was the second time i asked a girl who looked like she played tennis and found out they do play tennis.  Seems like the weather is pretty warm today. I was back home and headed straight to the bath before i have my lunch. After that, i was working on the jurong church website. I was in for a surprise as there was alot of things to include which slipped my mind. I'm actually behind schedule and i hope i can finish it asap. I had a nice nap in the afternoon and when i woke up, i was back to working on the website after my exercise. A good thing i found were some online sermons by dwight nelson.(http://www.pmchurch.org/real/index.html) So i listened to those sermons while i was doing up the website. What better way to get some spiritual food while i'm working..haha.

      Today was quite a day. It's been a long while since i went to mirc and in one of those channels i met my primary school classmate. haha...such a coincidence. Funny thing is, he's a gay but he's quite serious when he talks with you. We've (primary sch classmates) have tried talking him out of it but he said he can't change. I dont' really believe that people can't change their inclinations. It's like telling a smoker "hey you can't quit smoking coz you're born like that" or telling an alcoholic the same thing. I'm just sad for him that he's become like that and that his life is quite messed up judging by the fact that he hasn't found a fixed job all this while when he came out from school. Then i learnt he's going to be working in this new clubhouse and ask me to have our class gathering there next time. Yeah it's been quite some time since we had a gathering. I think the recent one was 2 or 3 yrs back. We have this yahoogroups thingy where we can mass mail to our pri sch classmates. What happened was i got an alert mail from yahoo that our account will be deleted as there were no messages that were posted in the past 90 days unless someone posted a message. Well, i decided to take the chance and do some "catching up" shall i say and updating of myself. Lo and behold, some of my ol friends replied back with their updates. It's really amazing when you think of it. It's been like 13 years since we finished primary school and there's something that keeps us together and i thank God for that. Friends are important in your life.  Another thing for today is..i'm still doing the jurong church website!!! AHHHHH..needed time to integrate the forum  to the site. And finally i knew a better way of doing it and it works now. The events calendar is done too. So now i'll have to finish off with the sermon listing and to split them up into quarters of the year.(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)..that's what i'm going to do next and i think it's quite fun too doing all this because you know you are in control!! Once again, the POWER..but then it's a different kind of power..haha...  Had bible study with andrew last night. We went through some stuff about how to make the most out of your own personal bible study. There were things in there that i knew for the first time. And i thought andrew was lucky to know all that at his age..haha. Well, bible study has been going on smoothly. He's been going on fine too. His exams are coming up in july but he doesn't mind continuing to meet up each week. Some people are just so smart. Yeah, i'm already thinking of what lessons to give after i finish those Discover bible guides. (finished 15 out of 26)...suddenly the "feeling" overwhelms me because i, being the teacher can teach him anything i want. Maybe i'll tell him more about ellen white after that or maybe teach him some christian apologetics or maybe some other stuff. The resources are endless!! And once again...the POWER!!!  Oh yeah, my friend who was visiting Jordan suddenly msned me. She was wondering how come i was up so early.(7pm) I was like, "yeah i just woke up"..i think she forgot that she's no longer in US where there's a 12 hour difference. It was about 2pm when she messaged me so probably she thought it was 2am here. Oh well, i got scolded for not reading her LONG letter..hahhaa....reading that made me so envious of her coz she said she's going to visit the pyramids of Giza and Valley of the Kings AND climb Mount Sinai and get this....swim in the dead sea!! AHHHHHHH it's not fair!!!!! ANyway i hope i can earn big cash so i can do what i want in terms of travel..gotta get that POWER!!!!

      It's the 23rd of June already and i can't believe time passed by so fast before my very eyes. I have tons of things i want to do and i realise that there is just so little time to do them. Firstly, i have to rush up with my website projects so that i can start looking for a job. The jurong church website would be a big thing i believe and so i'm looking forward to it being done.   I've been giving bible study to Andrew for about 4 months already. WOWWWW!! And we've covered 14 lessons. That means we've been meeting up in McDonalds for bible study for 14 times!!!! I think those staff recognize me when i go there each week...i THINK!..but i think also that there are too many people that go in and out of McDonalds everyday that they bother to remember.  Recently i started having my own bible study on the book of John. I decided to go through the book slowly and post my thoughts in a christian forum, aptly called christianforums.com under Daily Devotionals. I figured that this bible study will get me more acquainted with Jesus and for me to have more POWER in my life. POWER can change everything. And i'm already feeling this POWER the past few days. Thank God!

      It's 1am now and i'm here blogging away. I never thought i'll come here but i'm starting to think that it's fun blogging. Perhaps it's the freedom one gets as he types away and expresses his innermost thoughts. Yes, it's a release of all those pent-up emotions and sentiments. Anyway, these few days i've not had an early sleep. Early as in before midnight because of someone who's been keeping me awake past midnight. Well, i can't blame that person coz it takes 2 hands to clap. And just a couple of hours ago, i thought i could get an early sleep but my friend called at 930pm and asked me to join him to play pool. Well, managed to get the car and off we went. And got back at about 1230am and my hair is almost dry now.   A brand new day awaits!

      Today i stayed home the whole day. That means i didn't go to church this morning. It's been a looooooonng time since i stayed at home on a saturday morning. It seems that my fever has gone from me and is not coming back. That's good news..it means i don't have dengue!!!..BUT my feet are feeling cold now..is it because of the cold weather? I hope it is and not because my fever is coming back! Because i finished my dosage of panadol already and i don't have anymore "ammunition" left. So i feel VERY VulNeRaBlE!  I think after being sick for so long i've lost about 2 kg...i'm already so thin and i lost weight some more..sigh...i'll become like a stick if i lose somemore. I just saw a brochure from nature's farm advertising their mass gainer..hmm...thinking of getting that.

      Tonight i didn't attend cell group. Not because i didn't want to but because i couldn't..i'm still sick you see. Pik yee told me that if i had a fever for more than 4 days i better go for a blood test. Now with the dengue epidemic, and 2 of my friends who caught dengue fever, i'm starting to wonder whether i have a similar fate. But the cause of my fever was playing too much tennis in the morning..2.5 hours. Over-exertion is definitely the case. Furthermore, i don't remember any mosquito biting me in the past 1 month.    After dinner, i got to my bed and read "Welfare Ministry" by  urlLink Ellen White . I got bored and turned to my bookshelf to see if there were other more interesting books to read. Right then, i was compelled to re-read  urlLink "The Great Controversy"   by the same author. I've read it twice before but somehow i wanted to read it again. It is a thick book of almost 700 pages and i knew that from past readings, the first chapter was the most difficult to understand and boring one. It talked of "The Destruction of Jerusalem".  I started reading the preface, introduction and then the first chapter. Through the reading, i was amazed that i could understand what it was talking about. Had my eyes opened and understanding kindled? Hmm...maybe because God reveals more truth as we re-visit truth. Now what does the destruction of Jerusalem have to do with the great controversy? Perhaps it is a foundation for understanding the big picture because in Jerusalem's destruction, the people had rejected God's kindness and mercy and thus, God had taken away the protection over the people and taken away the restraining power over satan and his agencies. It gives an idea of God being in control and that if left to ourselves, we would die. The destruction of Jerusalem was a big thing. The mere writing of its record cannot portray adequately the devastating nature of the event. Only someone inspired by God can write so well the happenings. I read as if i was a first hand witness.    Miracles of mercy even occured during the attack when the Roman soldiers, at their first arrival to the gates of Jerusalem, without any reason, pulled back the attack. This allowed the christians in there to flee.     "When ye therefore shall see the 		abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy 		place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judea 		flee into the mountains." Matthew 24:15,    Another miracle was when the Roman general Titus, saw the temple in Jerusalem and ordered the soldiers not to touch it.       "Before attempting to gain possession of this stronghold,  he [Titus]made an earnest 		appeal to the Jewish leaders not to force him to defile the sacred place with 		blood.  Josephus himself, in a most eloquent 		appeal, entreated them to surrender, to save themselves, their city, and their 		place of worship. But his words were answered with bitter curses.   "      "It was an 		appalling spectacle to the Roman--what was it to the Jew? The whole summit of 		the hill which commanded the city, blazed like a volcano. One after another the 		buildings fell in, with a tremendous crash, and were swallowed up in the fiery 		abyss. The roofs of cedar were like sheets of flame; the gilded pinnacles shone 		like spikes of red light; the gate towers sent up tall columns of flame and 		smoke. The neighboring hills were lighted up; and dark groups of people were 		seen watching in horrible anxiety the progress of the destruction: the walls 		and heights of the upper city were crowded with faces, some pale with the agony 		of despair, others scowling unavailing vengeance."      The destruction of Jerusalem happened in AD 70.

      I'm still sick. Yesterday afternoon was almost dooms-day for me. After lunch, i went to rest and when i woke up few hours later, my hands and feet were freezing. I took the thermometer and measured my temperature..38.7 degrees. Oh my, i thought. So when my hands and feet are freezing, it means it's above 38 degrees. So what did i do? Nothing much..just lied down there hoping the cold would go away by snuggling in my blanket. My parents had to towel my forehead to keep the temp down and i felt i got warmer. Then, i took the panadol..i thought i was supposed to take it after dinner since it said twice a day but then it's been so long since i last took it (after bfast) so i did. After awhile, i started to feel warm...nice....then i could go and have a bath.    In the toilet, i noticed a lizard..not fully grown yet. It was on the wall going up....i saw it go up and suddenly it fell and gave me a shock. It managed to stick itself to the wall so it didn't hit the floor. I was thinking how come lizards have such special feet..almost like they have some suction power on their feet. Anyway, from out of nowhere, i saw a big black spider(i think) come down from the top of the wall right into the lizard's path. Then the lizard walked towards it and shot forth its head to bite the spider. After that, it shook its head violently. I think this is to make the spider blur. After that, i couldn't see what was happening already because the lizard went behind a piece of towel. (I witnessed all this while on top of the ivory tower so i couldn't move)..after a while, i heard 2 crunches..i guess that's it, that must be the spider's body being crushed..the lizard did have a good meal..such a big spider..of course it was happy.

      Today i woke up sick..slept at 11 plus and woke up at around 6am..didn't see the time but i guess it's around there. When i woke up i couldn't get back to sleep even though i lied on the bed for 2 hours. The feeling was quite bad. It was definitely because of yesterday's tennis game where i played 2.5 hours in the morning. So it was exertion that caused the sickness coupled with the sun's rays. Also, this meant that i rested the whole day. I don't know whether it's normal but when i rest, i can't get to sleep. I guess i've not had a fever for quite some time so i don't know whether it's normal. Tonight i hope i can really sleep. Actually i just came back from seeing the doctor. Besides the standard cough mixture, antibiotics and panadol, i also asked for sleeping pills. Wow it's $3.50 per pill and i got 5 of them...grr didn't know it was so expensive. In the end i paid $40 but as i had not enough money i had to go to the ATM to draw out some. Now that i'm sick, everything seems to go slower..when i was walking to the docs, the scene was very serene and i could see other people in their "house clothes" walking either to the nearby market or walking back to their blocks. The atmosphere was kinda relaxed and my breathing was calm and slow. At least this is one of the good things of getting a fever. It puts me away from the stressful lifestyle of always being efficient and productive and gets me to slow down.

      Guess i should blog now..haven't been blogging for a few days already. Well, i'll just talk about today.  This morning i had a tennis match from 10-1230pm with 2 other new friends i met previously. As usual, my form wasn't there today as i played. I just feel i could play better at night..hmm...maybe it's because of the weather or the lighting..haha...when it's dark, i'll have power!!!!...anyway, my serve is still quite lousy, i really think that my serve was much better when i had just finished tennis lessons. I could get more balls in that time than now. Oh well, i went to queensway after that and got a new shirt!!! Addidas climacool. It's Dri-Fit.so when you wear it, you don't feel that uncomfortable when you perspire. .actually i think it's the same shirt gary wore during ASF day. Oh well, i hope it's different because i saw 2 different blue shirts and i got the one with the white stripe at the side. I hope gary's one is different without the stripes..haha..i really feel uncomfortable when i see someone else with the same things i have. At one time i was wearing this t-shirt with a picture of a cute cartoon dog in front..then at clementi mrt, i saw another person wearing that..wah piang!! i avoided that person lor. I still need more shirts for tennis though. I heard Giordana has a new range called Dry-Tech. I think the next time i go by a Giordano store, i'll have a look at their range and probably get one for myself..hehe. oh yes i got this description from their website about the Dry-Tech range.    "As the name suggests, Dry-Tech is specifically designed to keep you dry. It  is a performance fabric which releases moisture 50% faster than cotton,  keeping you cooler and more comfortable! Available for men, women and kids,  this versatile collection is great for   workouts or just everyday casual  wear."    Wow..the description tempts me!!    I reached home at 530pm and i changed the grip of both my tennis racquets..now they are with a yellow grip! nice!!!!! I don't know when i started using funky colors...actually i don't mind them..i have this funky yellow shirt i bought from Bangkok. And my badminton racquet's grip color is white..eeeekkkss!!! I didn't know when i bought the racquet i had to choose a grip color too and that guy recommended white, so i just said ok..anyway, this was the first time so i might as well go with his recommendation and use my brain more next time..hahhaa..    Ok, when i got back, joel asked me how to cheer a person up..apparantly someone was depressed..hai..i really pity that guy..i read his blog and he's just 13 and already he's so "expressive" with his words. hai...i just think that there's much more to life than what he's experiencing ...there are people to meet and things to do!!!

      This morning i got a new fridge!! Yeah!!!! Now the old one can go away. The problem with the old one was that the fridge compartment was like a freezer. I think the thermostat got faulty so all the items inside froze. Basically the overnight food and everything inside either froze or were very cold. Anyway, the new one looks better than the old one, though it's not the BIG fridge that i'd wanted. My dad actually chose it himself. Nevermind, next time when this one breaks down i'll buy a fridge of my own. heheehe.     Besides that, today was quite a stressful day. Had calls coming in from  urlLink ywc  and other church calls..means more work!!! Anyway, i just got back from visitation. Had to go to 5 houses to pass them the DVDs..i didn't expect to take 2.5 hours to travel to all 5 of them even though they were in the west. It was tiring and i was yawning in the car after 3 houses.  We just put those DVDs in the letter box for 3 of them. For 2, at least we could deliver it personally to them. There's supposed to be a 6th one, but when we got there, the letterbox was locked. And we called this guy up, he said he can't remember requesting for the DVDs...grrrr..wasted trip down there. I think we got to call him again to try to jolt his memory.    Tomorrow will be a busy day for me..a whole line of activities awaits especially in the afternoon..until then...

      recently woke up and thought i'd blog since i've not done so for quite some time. Supposed to have a tennis game this morning but my friend said she's aching all over so the game is cancelled. Well, at least i can stay back and do my own recuperation. Right now i feel kinda lazy. Don't feel like going out or doing anything except use my fingers to try to entertain me..hahha. I have a whole bunch of things to do today. Need to finish programming the asco, ywc, union and jurong church site.  I realised that too many responsibilities result in diminished efficiency for individual tasks. I hope i can finish up one thing at a time so the tasks at hand won't be so daunting.     Meanwhile, i just found urlLink  joyce's blog.   In it there's a link about "addictive games"..so now i'm going through the list of games. The BMX one is really cool where i could do some stunts on the bike. I guess right now i need something to give me a kickstart before i start "work"..:)

      Today was quite a productive day. This morning had a tennis session and it was very useful for me to improve my skills..was focused on hitting the ball on the sweet spot so that my shots would be more determined and predictable. I look forward to the next time i play tennis..especially with Philippe. Guess my game with him has been looooooooooong overdue..something like 5 months? But i got to make sure i improve on my skill first before i start playing with him coz i know he's really good...haha. I don't want to be like the boy in the advert about class 90fm. i.e.."i gotta tell you george...your son holds the racquet...like agassi....with this..he may be..number 1"...oh boy i look forward to it. Gotta improve!!!!

      Ok, today was an utterly fulfilling day. Somehow i feel the POWER coming back to me. I had bible study in the late afternoon with Andrew. Had to shift the timing instead of at night because at night i had to go to church and do some calling of people. So basically i met Andrew and believe it or not, i've met him for 17 times at McDonalds!!!! Oh my..i'm glad there is McDonalds..at least they are providing us a place to do bible study..hehehe. Anyway, for the calilng part, we had to do calling to those people who attended the seminars by Peter Jack and Jon Paulien. They came to singapore earlier this year to give free seminars about lifestyle(Peter Jack) and the book of Revelation (Jon Paulien). So a group of us decided to go down to church and call those people together. It sure was fun when it started. I was given 20 people to call and the first 3 i called expressed interest in what we were promoting (the free loan of the Search DVDs by Geoff Youlden, another good speaker). So i felt i was in this telemarketing job and it was really fun calling and talking to people and promoting about my "product". I guess this is the only kind of sales i'll be interested in as other kinds like insurance and MLMs don't give me much of a motivation to be part of it. They somehow do it only for the money or whatever, but for this it's doing something for the benefit of people. That's why when we called them, some people asked why we were doing this, and so i replied that it was a community service and our goal is to improve the lives of singaporeans through health and lifetyle and also exploring life's issues. Out of the 20 people, 4 of them were interested for the DVDs and so i'll have to go down personally to deliver it to them. And as for the rest, i think the majority didn't answer the call. Guess i'll have to call them up again next week where we will be doing this calling session again. Fun fun fun.  And my friend from Accenture called me earlier on and told me there's a job opening there. He was telling me they are always seeking fresh graduates and the job sounding exciting. 5 day work week and working with different projects throughout the year. Hmm..i told him i couldn't take it yet as i'm doing some project work now so that will put my job search 2 months back. Well, i hope to complete my current project for Youngberg Wellness Center and then i'll have more fun searching for a nice job. Their website wasn't even listed in the search engine!! Oh my, i'm going to make it listed and bring in some business for them..hehehe..think of the potential for $$$$$  Oh well, tomorrow is shuqin's graduation. Another fun time! hahaa..this time she'll get the chance to do funny poses and maybe i'll post it up here later.  Tomorrow night i'll be having badminton again with some skillful people. Hmm...since i have tennis pics here, i think i should have other pics of the other sports that i do. Well that's all for now.

      Today was another tiring day..can't believe it. My weekends seem to see me tired at the end of the afternoon..hmm...anyway i had tennis early in the morning with some friends..tried to call my primary sch friend but she couldn't make it...she had a bowling tournament and represented her company. Oh well, anyway Elaine, Andrew, Ben, Nat and Ariel were there..had quite a fun time there and also we had excellent overcast weather..at least for the 2nd hour..because after that it started to rain. I finally knew what's wrong with my service. Coz my arm wasn't swinging straight up that's why. And i could hit the ball on the sweet spot much more often than last week which is excellent. Anyway, i'll post some pics of me. Oh yes, also my graduation pics.  So nice, nat and elaine came to my graduation just to take photos. I graduated together with jeffrey so both of us had photos taken after the ceremony. It was a nice experience and we had fun posing for the shots. We went outside to take and it was funny, coz even though i was wearing long sleeve shirt with tie and a gown on top, i didn't feel hot when i was having fun. Oh well..

      Today was church day. Went to church and in the morning there were 2 south african girls who came and attended our lesson study class. They're not native africans but indian africans. the elder one just graduated with a law degree..wah..and the younger sis just finished primary school i think. Anyway, they were telling us they are not all of the same faith. The elder sis and the dad is a pentecostal but the younger sis and mom are Adventists. Now i wonder how that happened..hehe.  Anyway, in the afternoon i had to attend some meetings. Evangelism committee meeting..hai..seems like almost every saturday i'm packed with meetings. Anyway it was good it was productive as we came up with ways to improve our evangelism methods..it was both very fun and exciting...can't wait to implement it.haha..well there is going to be a seminar coming up in september by this guy called Geoff Youlden. He's from Australia and he has come up with a series of documentaries regarding life's BIG questions. Very interesting. Must go and see. It's free too!  Oh yes, another thing is i found 2 badminton players in church. Good to know who plays what so next time i can call them along or organise a badminton game.   Then in the night i went to celebrate Benedict's bday at causeway point...was lugging my laptop along with my bag..grr...not that it's heavy, but it wasn't comfortable. Coz i had my bag slung on my shoulder and my shirt keeps sloping down as a result so it makes me uncomfortable..grr..

      i just got back from a meeting in church. We were discussing on how to improve on our current cell groups. (Cell groups are small groups where we come to share and encourage each other in our spiritual and personal lives) I could see that we are heading in the right direction to make cell group a much more conducive place for personal growth. Indeed there were alot of new ideas that came up and the overall tone during this meeting was exciting. Once we formulate a determined structure, i can see that we would be more comfortable to bring more friends too. Will talk about it next time.  Today was a day where i was working on the jurong website again. I completed the "free courses" page where free correspondence courses are available to anyone. Will post the webbie next time once there is an official launch. This jurong website thingy is taking me more time than i expected. Hmm..perhaps i'm not working to my full potential, like multitasking...haha.   Oh yes! Federer won another grand slam once again! Wimbledon 2004! I was hoping Roddick to lose. Actually both of them reminded me of David and Goliath with Roddick being the Goliath because of his power serves. Especially during the first set where you can clearly see Federer having trouble returning or even hitting his serves. On screen, they even calculated the reaction time you needed to return a "Roddick Serve". The time was 0.547 seconds...i was thinking..that's crazy! You can't even blink as you need all those milliseconds to capture the time the ball starts to hit off the racquet. Oh well, i'm still a beginner in tennis with an NTRP(http://www.sfu.ca/~tennis/ntrp.htm) of 2.5 so i'll just work my way up to get better.

      The tennis fever is heating up. Now it's the middle of the men's singles final and it's delayed because of the rain. Roger Federer, who is my favourite, seems to be losing out to Andy Roddick. Indeed, Andy has a great and imposing serve of which even the defending champion has difficulty returning. Oh well, i hope federer wins...he's a really cool guy..doesn't show any emotion at all even if he's in a losing streak..amazing.  As for me, this morning i went for some tennis with my friend at NUS. Still haven't recovered from my aches from the badminton game i had last week and unfortunately that has affected my play i guess. First time i tried in a practice court too and i must say, it's pretty fun playing there. The practice court is just a wall where you hit the ball to and it bounces back and you hit again. It's much more fun as i don't have to waste time picking the ball up so many times if i play for singles. Still haven't got my technique quite there yet and i'm still figuring out on finding the most comfortable strokes.  Yeah, tennis day today for me..:)

      I just got back from a badminton match. 4 ladies and 1 other guy. I got to know them all today through one of the girls. Was utterly surprised when i started playing with them. All of them could play quite well! And i think it was the one badminton match where i got home with the most aches. Now i have aches on my arm and wrist and my right leg. Now even trying to type properly..hehe..anyway, look forward to playing with them again...too bad none of them know how to play tennis..:(  Today has been quite fulfilling for me. I think in the morning i finished setting up the online library catalog for the church website. Then in the afternoon after lunch i went out to get a badminton racquet. Before lunch i had rummaged through the storeroom searching for those old badminton racquets i had. I knew all of them had the strings broken so i thought of restringing it. But when i took them out, i saw that they were rusty. So i thought it's no point to restring it. I might as well buy one brand new one and call it my own. So i went to Queensway shopping center. Once i reached there, i went to DBS to cash in a cheque. Wah i had to queue for quite some time...about 10 minutes..so when it got to my turn, the bank girl told me there's this new plan called life savings plan. She said i can get a higher rate of interest if i sign up for this plan. So she took me to one of those cubicles for further explanation. Actually another girl attended to me. When we first met, she extended her hand for a handshake...wah so formal har? i was thinking..i just came here to know more about the plan only mah. So she told me the minimum sum was $100. Cut a long story short, i told her i'll come back once i get a stable job. And then she extended her hand again, then bo pian gotta shake her hand....need to be so formal meh?...weird.. Anyway, i got this super cool badminton racquet for only $55! It's titanium and the design and color is so cool. And it's very light!! My father held it when i got back home and fir st thing he said was "wah so light"...hehe...good thing i went to the right shop because the salesman was very knowledgable and recommended me this racquet. It's a Gosen racquet. I haven't heard of the brand before..only know Yonex..but then he said that Gosen is well known by Malaysians and Japanese..oh well...so i took it..good price too coz the other shop was selling at more than $70. Anyway, i'm very happy i have my own personal badminton racquet..along with 2 personal tennis racquets..hehehhe..the POWER of owning more things..hehe.

      Singapore's 39th  National Day. I think singaporeans have been too pampered already. We live in such a comfortable and safe place and we take it for granted sometimes on how lucky we are. Goh Chok Tong is leaving as PM and it's quite sad to hear that it's going to be another chapter on Aug 12 when Lee Hsien Loong takes over. I respect Mr Goh immensely, not because we have the same surname, but because of his attitude. Unlike SM Lee, his attitude is soft and not so authoritarian. It's amazing how Mr Goh has retained his soft personality through years of working with SM Lee. Lee Hsien Loong doesn't have the same attitude as Mr Goh. In fact, i think he's like SM Lee, quite authoritarian. Oh well, i think the next chapter of Singapore is one ruled by increased dictatorship.  Yup, Mr Goh is stepping down. Hope he becomes number 2 when the new cabinet line up is announced. Watch out Singapore.

      Tonight was church cleaning night. I think we clean the church once a year so yup, it was high time we cleaned the church. For me i was assigned to clean the library. It was supposed to be me, aggie and barbara but so sad!!! Only me came to clean...hai..so sad...barbara said she had to go back for her brother's birthday and aggie didn't come to church for cleaning at all. Meanwhile, i'm still looking for someone to replace me as chief librarian..hahaa..i'm looking towards Andrew, but then he wants to start as a junior position first...hehehe..maybe after a while, then i can promote him to be chief!!!muahahahahah. Okok, anyway we had a fun time cleaning the church because we all worked together. After i finished with the library, i went around with my digital camera to take some pictures...so at least there's evidence that such and such a person came to help out!!!hahhaa..then i can send the pictures to pastor..hahaa...wah piang today so cranky...okok..talk serious. Yup, after the pictures, i went to the sanctuary to check out what they were doing. I saw uncle TC polishing the pews with some sort of lemon fragrance spray for wood. So he asked me to help too, so i took a bottle and a new cloth and i went to polish the right section of the sanctuary. Then weixiang came along to help me too...and after that, we went around polishing anything that's made of wood..i polished the notice board and the doors and even the social hall's wood panels. Yup, so when you go in the social hall next week, you'll be able to smell this lemon fragrance still lingering in the air. After that we went to the soon-to-be youth room which is the former pastor's office. I actually found the room very small for the number of youths that we have but then no choice lah, got to make do with what we have. So we just cleaned and vacummed the room. Some of the youth had to bring the gigantic vacuum cleaner up the stairs to vacuum the room. So after that was done, i went down, took some snacks..i think pastor bought alot of snacks and after that went home with my mom in  a cab..what a day!

      ahhh my blog didn't get posted!! and i have to rewrite everything  now...grrrr...okok breathe in..breathe out..  ok let's start with starhub..last night a starhub salesgirl called me  and wanted me to sign up for this $14 a month scv..i thought that was  reallll cheap!!! It was a very attractive offer because i was thinking  of signing up next time too  but then i told her that until i get a job,  i won't sign up. So she gave me her number to make sure she gets my  business when i get a job..haha...well, i hope she's still working  then.hahha..  So when i was going to have my dinner, i took out a plate and went to  the rice cooker to get some rice. Just when i opened the lid, i saw Mr  Lizard!!!! He was there 1 foot away from the rice cooker and was at a  sideways position. He saw me but he didn't move you see. But i wasn't  freaked out by it because i know Mr Lizard is there 50% of the time i  take rice. I also wanted to take a picture of him but then aiyah, the  camera was in the living room and i didn't know whether it was charged.  And the whole time i was taking rice and when i closed the lid, he  didn't move at all!! Until i walked away then he walked away  too..hahaha..so cute!!!!! You should see him!!
