      Jack and I went to Wally-Mart and&nbsp;finally got a&nbsp;Dickie's jumpsuit my name is Freek-A-Leek. Jack, of course is Jack-Pot And Ryan is the only one yet to make his. He needs a name. Me and Jack keep sayin' Bulbous Head...cause thats his  name,  but he is embarrassed.&nbsp;If anyone has an idea...tell me. Ryan needs major help...he has mental problems.  We also caught some fish at Jack's pond. The fish tank we are making finally got a bottom. As soon as the caulk dries it will be ready for use. All those fish we caught need a home...

      Today, I went over to Jack's house. He has a pond behind his house. The problem is, the huge, mean turtles that live there were eating all the fish. So we had to catch some turtles. First, we spent half an hour trying to catch a fish to use as bait for the turtles. After we finally got one, we cut it up and baited the line. Not long after, one of the lines got tight. We pulled the turtle in only to find out that it was "engaging" another turtle of opposite gender... We tried to get both, but the other swam away. I named the one we caught Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton almost bit off my thumb. Oh! We are also in the middle of making a fish tank... again cause were bored. I'll let ya know how it turns out. All-in-all...it was an eventful day.
