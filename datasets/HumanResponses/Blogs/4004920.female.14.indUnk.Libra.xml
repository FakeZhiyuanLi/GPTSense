       i spent the night at nicole's last night.    we ran.&nbsp;and watched there's something about mary.&nbsp;and ate kfc.&nbsp;and talked all night.    then today we watched whatever it takes.&nbsp;and rode bikes to hershey's for ice cream.    i had to ride the screwed up bike.    but it's okay because nicole bought me  birthday cake  ice cream.    yum.     &nbsp;   i just saw our neighbor's new baby girl.    she's very cute. her names camille, or cammy for short.    aww.    i hope i get to babysit.     &nbsp;   GIN BLOSSOMS ARE PLAYING HERE AT BELMONT SUNDAY!!!    yeah. so uh, come. pleeease.    tix are only $10.     &nbsp;   ♥

       yesterday was quite funnn.    jamie called me & told me that him &amp; jordan were going to the pool so i walked up there & hung out with them.    then erica &amp; candace showed up so we hung out at the pool & the park.    we went on the swings! i beat jordan in our swinging contests.    because i  always  win. ;)    then we all jumped on the trampoline at candace's.    good times  !       &nbsp;   then i went with kathleen & her mom to  red robin .    crispy chicken burgers    after that we went to old navy at the mall &amp; shopped for the salvation army thing where you buy school clothes & supplies for kids that don't have enough money to buy them themselves.&nbsp;    we're very talented shoppers!    then we just watched music videos & hung out all night.     &nbsp;   i had to  walk  home from her house today.    it was not very much fun.     &nbsp;   CHANGE IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD, KIDS.   especially when you're changing into an asshole.   trust me, nothing stays a secret very long.    &nbsp;   ♥      &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       i saw  the notebook  last night with kathleen!    it was kind of depressing at the end. :-\    this one girl sitting behind us was  bawling  the whole movie..like, before it even got sad!    we were laughing at her.    but it really made me want a boy like that. I WANT A NOAH!!     &nbsp;   yeah. so today i'm at my mom's work because i have an orthodontist appointment & she didn't want to drive all the way home to pick me up &amp; take me.    yeaah, not fun. especially since i was supposed to hang out with erica today.     &nbsp;   k, & just putting this out there:    usually you don't have a shot with your (ex)girlfriends best friend.     &nbsp;   ♥ &nbsp;

       last night i went to  coldstone  with angela & sip.    FUNNN.    they made fun of me a lot. :[    then we went to angela's house.    i'm very jealous of ang's new stick!!!     &nbsp;   then this morning i went to preseason xc with erin.    haha. yeah.. i wouldn't say it was  fun , but whatever!     i really think i bruised my rib at the all star express.   (where we got raped..reallyreally bad by the skywalkers)   it hurts. a lot. like, really, a LOT.    yeah, i fell really hard&nbsp;flat on my&nbsp;face. it was bad. i looked dumb.   cable helped me (luvya vic!). BUT IT STILL HURTS REALLY BAD.    &nbsp;   I WANT THE NEW BEN KWELLER CD.    it's not really even new anymore. but i want it.     &nbsp;   i love this song...      He said I was in my early forties  with a lot of life before me  when a moment came that stopped me on a dime  and I spent most of the next days  looking at the x-rays  Talking bout the options  and talking bout sweet time     I asked him when it sank in  that this might really be the real end  how's it hit you when you get that kinda news  man what'd you do  and he said     I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.     He said I was finally the husband  that most the time I wasn't  and I became a friend a friend would like to have  and all the sudden going fishin  wasn't such an imposition  and I went three times that year I lost my dad     well I finally read the good book  and I took a good long hard look  at what I'  d do if I could do it all again  and then     I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'  d been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.     Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about  what'  d you do with it what did you do with it  what did I do with it  what would I do with it?     Sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I watched an eagle as it was flying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.  To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying        ♥     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

       this weekend has rocked sooo much.    friday night kathleen spent the night.   we had pizza and then we went to coldstone.   birthday cake remix!   thennn we went to the  new  target.   oh boy, did we have fun in there! haha. we watched  stand by me  that night. best movie ever. then saturday kathleen & i went to the mall.   got some good deals there!    kaitie called me like 83902 times while i was gone, so i called her back when i got home &amp; we went to the pool.   after that we went camping.   we roasted marshmallows & made s'mores. and i actually got on an ATV driven by kaitie quigley. that was just a little bit scary. and we swam in the river. and i learned how to fish! haha. except we didn't catch anything.    tonight was the  GIN BLOSSOMS CONCERT !!!   the end was so much fun. ahh. good times.    everyone that didn't go- you missed out  !      two of my best friends helped me  realize  something this weekend.   there are certain things that your  true  friends just don't do to you.    &amp; when people that are any kind of friend to you do that, they apologize.   at least once. if not many times.    kait &amp; kathleen, i love you both tons.      ♥
