      This story is famous among my friends and since I’ve been asked to repeat it many times I think it’s time I just write it down.  Several years ago, I was going through a dry spell sexually. I like sex. A lot. Before I was with my fiance, I almost always had a sex buddy. But there was this 2 month dry spell. I actually managed to wear out a vibrator during this time. In fact, the vibrator had worn out a few days before this incident and I hadn’t managed to get a new one yet.  Yet I decided to go have drinks with friends anyway. I should have known better – if I am horny before I start drinking the horniness will only get worse. I had 3 or 4 beers – good friends could tell I was drunk, but I wasn’t sloppy or silly. (Sometimes when I am forced to tell the story I exaggerate how drunk I was, but here I feel a need to be honest) Anyway, sitting at our table was Ben.  I had known Ben casually for several months. He seemed sweet. He seemed to be interested in me. And between my hormones and the beer, he suddenly seemed attractive enough. Gradually my friends began to leave. I stayed to sober up. . .and flirt with Ben.  And when Ben invited me to his nearby apartment, I went (yes I let someone know where I was going, yes this was probably still a bad idea).  So we got to his place. And began messing around. Everything was fine until he unzipped his pants. Not that I hadn’t been planning on having sex with him. It was just that he had the biggest penis I’ve ever seen in my life. Including those I’ve seen in porn movies and websites. And while I’ll be the first to say that size does matter – I now point out that size matters in both directions. Looking at him, I knew there was no way that I was going to get laid that night.  I knew I couldn’t handle anything that big.   I said as much. He suggested oral sex. I hesitated. I actually find performing oral sex more intimate than intercourse. Also, I wasn’t even sure I could get that thing in my mouth. Ben sensed my reluctance and decided to persuade me. He reached in his nightstand and . . . . .  Pulled out a bottle of olive oil. He poured some on his member while I stared in shock. And then I thought, well now, you’ve never tried this – maybe it’ll be fun.  I nearly gagged. Olive oil and bread? Yes. Olive oil and penis? NO.   I decided I should leave. I apologized. I grabbed my stuff and ran out the front door. I turned the car on and pulled my sweater over my head. As I began to back out I saw Ben coming out his front door. I drove home as quickly as I could.   At least I’m not horny anymore, I thought. I was wide-awake, though, so I decided to check my e-mail. A few minutes later, someone knocked on my door. Ben.   He asked to be let in. I said no. He yelled, “But I brought the olive oil!”
