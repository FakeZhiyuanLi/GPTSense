      last night, I went to sleep around 2 o'clock. Around 3AM I heard this  really really really   LOUD  sound. Thunder and Lightning. I couldn't see the light though cuz I was sleeping. I was like..holy fuck..scared to my pants. Ten like 3 minutes later, a not so loud one strikes again, but it was loud enough. I ran to my moms room and I asked her to sleep with me. But I stayed over there. My dad was in the other room. God it was scarrry. It boom-banged  all  night.   This morning I woke up to see that is was beautiful and sunny outside! what the hell!! My dad told my mom that he was scared too. haha   Hey I may be 16 but I'm a scaredy cat!

      I have a freaken crush. I can't get him off my heeaaaddd!!It sucks cuz I have absolutely no chance but at least we talk. sometimes. in the hallways. I got kinda eh when I went to this other girls site and they hang out a lot. grr.   god its annoying when ppl are like 'I want to kill myself' Its like holy crap they talk about it for hours..days, they write about it..yet nothing has happened. I mean if you really wanted to kill yourself, you'd already be dead. I will never understand it. *shakes head.

      I've known this person for my whole life and I known this other person for only 6 or 7 years of my life, but he has a reputation of being trustworthy, goodhearted and honest. But I should trust the one I knew for my whole life right? He is in fact my own brother.

       You may feel like daydreaming all day about that guy or girl you have a crush on. That's cool, but don't get so wrapped up in them that you forget about that test you have to study for!    Aw yes I do have a crush. I didn't think I would have a crush this year but I do. Its a harmless crush though. Nothing will ever happen. God I miss him.

      I'm reading a memoir by Alice Sebold called Lucky. Its a really good book so far. She gets raped while in college and her life ends there. She spends a long time saving herself and also wanting to 'kill' her rapist. But she really doesn't kill him. He's serving 8-32 (I think) years in prison. I don't understand why anyone would do such a thing. Go pick up some woman in a street corner instead of forcing someone to do it. Geez.   Its almost 1am but I'm not sleepy. I won't get any sleep tonight on account of being on my damn period.

      I wish Sundays would go on without:  waking up early forcing to clean arguing  Sundays would be perfect without those.

       Don't loan anything out unless you don't mind if you don't see it for a while. It's not that your friends are thoughtless, but they can be a little absentminded. Hang on to the things you really want to keep.   I hate having ppl borrow my stuff. Sue has borrowed my markers on Tuesday. I had her promise she would give em back on Wendesday. I had her promise that there would be 50 markers. She still has them. Today she also said she would come by my house to give them to me. Don't make promises if you aren't sure you aren't gunna keep em. Don't amke excuses. I don't care. A promise is a promise. And you broke it.

      I forgot that I love Coyote Ugly. It's such an awesome movie, a motivational one with a lot of dancing. I like watching people dance but I can't and won't try it at all.   Tomorrows the last day of school, not including the exam days next week, I only have one day next week cuz I'm only taking one exam! I'm sad.   Its 12AM and the birds are already chirping!!  Lakers won!!

      I don't like him anymore. I think don't I like him anymore. I dragged his backpack down and like he practically flew into the lockers and his face was like red. That's when I knew I was crossing the line. I blew it. It's over. No more crush. No more going to their house. It was fun while it lasted.   Forgot to mention, I went to Pegah's Friday. Big ass house. Had a pretty fun time. Pegah's coming over tomorrow cuz we got  nothing  done on Friday. heh.
