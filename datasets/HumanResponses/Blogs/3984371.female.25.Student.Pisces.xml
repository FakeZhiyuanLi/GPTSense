      I know I don't have to justify anything, it is just inherantly in my nature to try and sustain a positive image. *LMAO* just kidding. I'm just in weird moods sometimes.  Speaking of, what is with my obsession for watching other people play video games? Does anyone else think that's weird? I love just laying there watching my best friend, both of them actually, play whatever new video game he has. It's kinda fun. *SIGH* Talk about lame. Oh, well. I just chalk it up to time well spent!  Sorry for the lack of posts; I am busy trying to finish up my summer classes. I did, however, find a job, so I am no longer useless. AND, my friends are coming back to town so LIFE IS GRAND!!!

      Ok, I just read my previous post and I sound&nbsp;  REALLY   pathetic. *LOL* I guess I should clarify a few things:   a.) I promise I am not  that  obsessed with TV, though I  have  been known to, on occasion, get that caught up in one of my favorite shows.  b.) I probably average about 10-15 miles a day on my bike, so I  am  active. I like to frequent a local park that has a concrete oval around it. I usually try to bike around for about 5 miles then layout in the sun catching up on the reading I have to do for my Utah History class.  (Although I am American Indian and have a great complexion, I subconsciously feel the need to surpass the seemingly BLACK fake-n-bakes around here with my own gorgeous tan . . .)   c.) More often than not, I spend a lot of time sending out resumes on the internet, chatting on the phone, reading&nbsp;or doing homework.    SO . . .  I swear I am not some 500lb individual who does nothing but watch TV. (Most of you know that anyway, so I am not sure why the clarification.)   Also, In regards to the comments I have received: 1.) Yes, I do know and   LOVE   Elucid, aka Erick. How can I  NOT  love the next best thing I have to a nephew?&nbsp;;)  2.)&nbsp;No, I have not seen  Orgasmo , though I have heard lots about it and I think it is probably hilarious.

      Why is it that when I do not have a job for a certain amount of time I feel so useless. Here is a brief synopsis of my day:   Groggily roll out of bed around 10am, (11am or 12pm if I don't have my one class of the summer,) and slowly pad into the living room. I usually glance half-heartedly at my online meteorology course and wonder if I should finish the 7 chapters I have 3 weeks to do. (Not to mention the 3 tests I have to take.)&nbsp; At this point, I decide whether or not I have to go to school to use the computer since I am too poor to own my own. If there is nothing pressing, I may get absorbed in  Unsolved Mysteries  or the  Nanny  on  Lifetime  or something else equally interesting. (I actually spend a lot of daytime hours watching the  Food Network  jotting down new recipes. I have a great recipe collection because of this.)   Sometimes, if I am feeling ambitious, I may mosey on down to Provo on my Bike, about a 5 mile bike ride from my house up one  ENORMOUS  hill, and go to the local waterpark that my friends and I have season passes to. (It reminds me a lot of good ol  Whitewater Bay ; it costs $20 to get in and you're bored after about 2 hours. We got our season passes for $30, normally $120, so we feel this was a worthwhile puchase.) However, Amber, my old roomate, is currently out of town and Sondra, the other person we got passes with, is in Colorado until Aug.   Then, whenever I have finished the worthwhile activity that manages to take up my afternoon, I come home and see if anyone wants to play with me. Inevitably rejected, I fix dinner, maybe make cookies, search my movie collection for new scenes/monologues to do in Acting Class, and then settle in to watch the  Nanny  @ 10pm. @ 11pm, when it's over, I'll flip to  CourtTV  or  A&E  and see if I've seen that particular Forensic Files or Crossing Jordan re-run, which occupies my time until  Millionaire  comes on the  Game Show Network  @ 1am. I usually toss and turn in bed until about 2 or 3am and the viscious cycle begins again.  *SIGH*   Let's face it; more often than not my typical day ends up being like the one I had yesterday: Worked out @ 10am, then settled down and watched a  History's Lost &amp; Found  marathon on the  History Channel  until I had to go to acting class @ 6pm!   DAMNIT! I need a job before I go insane . . . or run out of room for recipes, which ever comes first.

      Ok, ok. I guess I should start by explaining the use of the name "Cahokia Mounds". THis is where it comes from:  &nbsp; My best friend since the seventh grade, Joey, came up with the name. He came home one day to find his roomate watching a video entitled "Cahokia Mounds". he laughed and said something to the effect of "Why does that sound like the title of a really bad Porn?"  &nbsp; Now, I am what you would call . . . mammilarily endowed. (Translation: I have big tatas.) For some reason, throughout most of our friendship, Joey has had this odd fascination with my rather succulent appendages. As a result of this, he has bestowed upon me the name of Cahokia Mounds because he feels that would be my porn star/stripper name if a.) I didn't have morals. b.) I weighed about 100 punds less and c.) it were a perfect world.  &nbsp; So, there you have it.

      I just took a really cool IQ test online. Of course I guess you have to take these things with a grain of salt as to their accuracy, but I am pretty impressed with my score. Of course, I have no idea what is considered "Average", but I guess I have always felt I was above average. It's nice to know I may be correct in that assumption. *GRIN*   "Congratulations, Dana! Your IQ score is 131   urlLink    This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others. Your Intellectual Type is Facts Curator. This means you are highly intelligent and have picked up an impressive and unique collection of facts and figures over the years. You've got a remarkable vocabulary and exceptional math skills â€” which puts you in the same class as brainiacs like Bill Gates. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results. "   Of course, because it was one of those advertisements that pop up, I have to pay to get my "FULL" test results and what they mean, but I don't really care to know all that much. But, you know, it's nice to know that my neverending quest as an eternal student has paid off in my intelligence! *GRIN*  On a different note, I AM ALMOST DONE WITH SUMMER TERM! Hallelujah and pass the popcorn! I just have to take one more test and submit 5 more online assignments by Monday and I can take a breather until fall starts on the 25th. Yea.

      Here are a few quotes to keep you thinking while I finish my finals:  Never argue with an idiot: they drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.  They say those who can't play, coach. Apparently, those who can't coach, sit 30 rows back, shirtless, shouting obscenities.  "I'm looking for something in an attack dog, one who likes the sweet gamey tang of human flesh. Hmmm, why here's the fellow . . . wiry, fast, firm proud buttocks . . . reminds me of me . . ." -----Mr. Burns  *SIGH* only 2 more days and life will be GRAND!
