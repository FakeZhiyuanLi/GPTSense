      Notes from Michele Budden 1:1 7/15/2004   General questions I have are:    -what data or information do you need that you don't already have,  -what's not working with what has been delivered so far,  -what initiatives are you working on that may need some additional data or a new way of looking at existing data    Rev Gen Prgms TS Portfolio- MArgin Analysis (cost vs revenue)- systems don't really have ability to do that analysis better would be a tie in to eCustomer to get a consitent customer representation  taking our cost and allocating them to things in C3  What is the eCustomer timeline...? how can we access them...? If we can use the cust id to id service usage and tie back to revenue.  All service revenue comes from Finance (Bill-TO id), but the usage info is more critical (market segment is needed to map the parent company/child companies market segments)  Monitoring performance and usage of programs, rollups by segment/market/contract type, contract hierarchy missing...ERBI has some of the service hierarchy data  -- Phase II : MArketing Spin - Business analysis and metrics- programs to keep/not keep; rolled up customers by program  -- Not sure about the GPS side of things, Julie SHottman/ Angie Blum  - Support the deals - negotiating contracts - views of customer usage  - Boundary reporting systems may have additional needs in the June timeframe

The team is now more of an autonomous collective – each person working on their own area. So in some instances, work is being duplicated •	Worst Thing about the track: we’re in corners that will be difficult to grow out of. Poor tactical decisions; not really a data warehouse or a reporting repository. Business layer doesn’t really do what it should. It will be difficult to scale over time.

      This site was recommended to me by a few of our consultants. The Data Warehousing Institute seems to have the best seminar content and they host events pretty frequently. A bit pricey...we'll see if this will work with the travel and education budget.   urlLink TDWI Seminar Series

      I've wanted to start a BLOG for a while...mainly since I've started a new position here at Cisco. I figure a BLOG is a good way to keep track of tidbits I learn as I venture into the new worlds of project management and data warehousing.  Here's how the new gig lined up for me:  For the past two years, I was a tech lead on an Oracle 11i project. If you're not familiar, Oracle 11i is the latest version of the eBusiness suite from Oracle (the data base company). My team's role was to collect all of the various configurations that we needed and to manage the loading of those configurations (and track changes...maintain several instances of the data for development, testing, production, etc). So that was a huge project ($80M+ )and the project was a big success. My team was a cross-functional one so I really got to see all the different parts of the business.  So as that project wrapped...at least the critical phases wrapped...I started looking for something new. I think my management team wanted to keep me engaged at some level, and they knew I had an interest in business processes. So I've taken on a new role as an IT Project Manager and have been assigned a project that really has yet to be defined (I'll be working with the business to understand what their initiatives are and what data they will need). The project team I am part of is called Issue-to-Resolution Strategic Information Systems or I2R SIS. Issue-to-Resolution is the business process that handles post-sales support for Cisco equipment (this of it as traditional tech support with a lot of bells and whistles).  Anyway, the new gig has me reading lots of books on data warehousing ("The Data Warehouse Toolkit"- Kimball, Ross and "Mastering Data Warehouse Design: Relational and Dimensional Techniques"- Imhoff, Geiger, Galemmo and "Oracle DBA Guide to Data Warehousing and Star Schemas"-Scalzo). I'm also boning up on the associated technologies (Oracle Warehouse Builder, Oracle Designer, Business Objects). Then there are also the "project management" skills (ok, so I've been leading projects and doing project management for years, but now that my title has changed it was requested that I formalize my training)- I'm enrolled in several course offered by ESI and will probably work towards an associate level certification...just to have the lambskin (LOL).  So this is my work life right now. Not terribly attractive, but it pays the bills. I'm hoping to leverage my PM position and the touchpoints I'll have with the business into the next gig: maybe a role within the business. I have a goal of getting into the management area, but without an MBA that might be tricky at Cisco these days. Promotions nearly impossible to come by and pretty much every manager or senior project manager I know was groomed outside of Cisco, then hired into the senior PM or Manager roles. So it seems to me that corporate America isn't all that different from my Army days: you have to move on to move up!

      OK, so now it is official. As of August 1st, I am an IT Project Manager. Strictly a title change and I have yet to find a grand epiphany. However, several of my colleagues who came up through the IT Engineer ranks with me have stopped by to say "congrats". Not sure why but I guess there is a presumption that my transition to PM included some financial or status improvement- I can assure you nothing of the sort has happened. In some ways it has made things tough for me since I have no idea how many other PMs there are in my job grade(and all indicators are that I am no closer to a promotion). All-in-all though, I believe this was the right step for me since I have grand visions of going into the management track- and still hold to the idea of someday being in an executive position.  Otherwise, Info Delivery II is now a "Real" project and the clock is ticking for us. Actually, I have to come up with a reasonable resource plan in very short order. As people roll off other projects, I want to try and recruit them to ID2. My goal is to be a Cisco-employee heavy team. My fear over the past few years has been that we have relied on contractor knowledge and not done a good job of developing employee skills to fill those voids when the contractors walk. BUt for now, its me and one analyst who recently joined the team. I'm giving her plenty of room to ramp up and get a feel for the technical and business environment we're operating in. Soon, it will be hammer to the floorboard so I don't want to burn her(or myself) out. Actually, with the scope of ID2, I think we may need a second analyst and may run this release as a multi-track project. I still need to mull over the tracks, but I have some good ideas in la cabeza.  On the home project front, I just finished my seventh DVD of family footage (or as Isabella calls it "Baby Isa TV"). It has been a blast reviewing all the old footage and photos. My new Dell Inspiron 9100 has bee invaluable since I can now port the PC from office to living room- to wherever- and work on the DVDs whenever I get a spare few minutes(and no contention with Mrs. D on the keyboard). THe new PC actually is faster than the Vaio desktop, and it has more RAM and a better video card, so it is a better experience all the way around. Also, the 9100 came with a great software package called MyDVD for putting together quick DVDs. I already had more specialized software, but MyDVD definitely helped me crank stuff out faster. Someday, I'll probably go back and cull out a highlights DVD and showcase my creative side- for now I'm trying to get as much raw footage editted and loaded onto DVDs in chronological order. Right now, DVD#8 is underway (Fall/Winter 2003). It won't be long and I'll have to changeup my DVD theme to include Baby Annie...
