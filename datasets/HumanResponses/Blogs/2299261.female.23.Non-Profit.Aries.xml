      Like Heather, I wanted to sit on this one for awhile...but the more I sit the more I realize that I can't put my finger on what it is exactly that He is showing me or teaching me.  I think it's because I feel like the past two years have been a lesson on hearing His voice.  If you know me at all, you know that I come up with a different idea about the future every five minutes!  My freshman year at FSU I wanted to go to Tacoma, WA to work for World Vision.  Then I wanted to graduate early, intern with Focus on the Family, in Colorado (that was the best sounding one so far!).  Then there was Southern.  Though hindsight, I KNOW that the Lord used that whole thing for my good, I still walked in a direction until He had to literally change my heart away from being so bent towards seminary in Louisville.  Now...here I am home in Orlando, working at the O.G., interning with Student Venture, and still trying desperately to hear His voice clearly.  He said to me this morning, "Leslie, listen to Me, listen to Me, and eat what is good, and your soul WILL delight in the Richest of Fare."  (Isaiah 55:2).  He always brings me back to, "Seek first My kingdom, Les, and My righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you...Do not worry about your life."  (Matthew 6:33, 25).  I've realized again that to even claim this life as my own is foolish.  This is NOT my life.  I belong to Him.  So in that this whole listening thing you'd think would then make some sense...nope.  I still am learning what it means to listen to a God who has given me a Life, that I don't own, that I don't control, that somehow I can still screw up by making poor decisions.  Umm... I want to delight in the Richest of Fare, Jesus.  Shane & Shane sing a song about Him...  Beauty for Ashes A garment of praise for my heaviness Beauty for Ashes Take this heart of stone and make it Yours  I delight myself in the Richest of Fare Trading all that I have for all that is better A garment of praise for my heaviness You ARE the greatest taste,  You ARE the Richest of Fare  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Perhaps He will be exalted if I would just obey Him and not worry about my life.  To rest in His daily grace, to "Just Breathe" and stop striving.  I hope this answers the question...much love from O-town...

         What has God been teaching me eh? I looooooooooove this question. lol thats a bit of sarcasm. For any of you that dont know... im not the best at expressing myself when it comes to anything of meaning. But I will delight in my weaknesses, for when I am weak, then I am strong. lol .... okay now that we have that squared away. What is the Lord teaching me? What is he not teaching me right now? Complete honesty... He is doing alot in my life right now, most of which I would much rather trade in. Some of it I am angry about, some of it im confused about, and some of it I want a rush lesson on. However, I would like to answer this question without giving a round about answer like I do when I am usually asked such a question (wink wink).  In fact, I have just answered this question, then deleted it becuase, I decided it was too round about and I that I didnt answer the question. And why? becuase I could not express myself well enough to say what I wanted to say! lol aaaaaah its a crazy cycle, but hey there always has to be a 'weird one' in every group, and well I volunteer myself.    The Lord is teaching along with so much more,  patience  and  trust . How many things do I know but do not believe with all my heart, or else I wouldnt be questioning? I mean if I believed with 100% of my heart that God, the Creator of the Universe, is actively involved with my life right now and loves me so much that he has promised me to see me through this phase of my life, then I would have nothing to worry about. I would not doubt anything, nor would I get consumed or overwhelmed with circumstance. If I had 100% of trust in the Lord that he would actually see me through, and trust that every moment is within the Lords control and therefore lived through for a reason, then how much more would I delight in my weaknesses, hardships, difficulties... how much stronger would I feel? These are the things that the Lord is Challenging me with. These are the things that faith needs to grow off of. Faith is putting our trust in things we cannot see. What is faith without trust? And how can I practice having faith when I am not patient enough to put my trust in those things that I cannot see? Don't let me give the wrong impression. I have a strong faith, and I trust the Lord and I will wait on the Lord all of my days! However, It is when speed bumps arrise, that the Lord has brought to my attention, that these things in which I profess suffer a fractional loss. I want to be 100%. I dont want to settle for faith the size of a mustardseed. My Lord deserves more than that! Trust and patience... these are foundational concepts... if it were to be rubbed (like through situations I am enduring now) what would prevent it from making raw the foundation on which I stand? The Lesson?... How to maintain a place in which to stand, so that in times of renovation your foundation is maintained strong... Jesus' response?  urlLink  Luke 6:47-49   He is telling me to... Take His hand... and Take His word... and to use His hand to lean on for balance, as I lay His words down as concrete, strengthening the foundation, so that when a storm comes it will not be shaken... So here is some truth to add to my foundation..." Trust  in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight." Proverbs 3:4-6, and "Be joyful in hope,  patient  in affliction, faithful in prayer." Romans 12:12  I answered it! Les, a year and a half later, I answered the question! ::gives half a smile and a quick wink to the right::

      Yay, we're all present and accounted for.  :)  So, let's get this party started with a "serious" discussion topic.     What has God been teaching you lately?   That's basic, I know, but it's a good starting place.  Besides, I'd like to hear your answers.  :)  Perhaps almost everything can be traced back to this issue, and that's why I seem to always be learning it - but I'm currently learning to increase my trust in Jesus.  It's basic, I know, but it's true.  There have been several situations in my life lately where I want to pull away from people.  Let's face it - sinful people will fail you every time.  I don't want to take risks and end up getting hurt.  But I must.  God created us in relationship with Him  and  others.  So right now I'm learning to lean on Jesus when I'm taking risks with other people.  I'm trusting that those newfound friends who are Christians will be seeking God's will as well.  Sometimes that doesn't end up the way I want (based on past experiences) - friends let me down, boys are stupid, even random acquaintances sometimes wield the power to batter and bruise me.  But to date, the pieces have always been put back together.  God is good, and I can rely on His provision.  (That sounds really cheesy and trite... but it's true, and it's a good lesson to have drilled into my dense brain.)  As I was mopping my kitchen and pondering what I would post here, I realized that y'all have provided context to know that my faith is grounded in reality.  In past years, I've been hurt by people I care about and I've been able to approach them to discuss the matter.  That's a simple thing, but it's big for me - when I was in high school, it didn't work that way.  Friendships that have been through rough spots grow in meaning for me, because they remind me that our relationships are built on more than a good time.  Next?  :)

      "How good and pleasant" this is you guys!!!  I was overjoyed, Carla, when I got your invitation to join this FSU blog.  Thank you for thinking of me!  I'm so blessed to know you all.  Hey Heather & Jesse!!  This is going to be so much fun...

      Okay folks, here's the deal.  Debbie and I were talking, and we thought that as much as we encourage discussion on our blogs, this might be a fun resource for us.  This isn't a replacement for our individual blogs - I don't know about y'all, but I post stuff all the time that you might not have a response for.  I want to post that on my blog regardless - my blog is very ME, but this is meant to be very US.    In other words - this is a blog for discussion of any kind.  It has whatever life we choose to give it... but we thought it would be fun.  Anyone who has been extended and accepted an invitation has access to posting in this forum.  In theory, we could invite other friends of ours who DON'T have blogs (if they want to play.)  This could be a fun way to keep in touch, just chatting about the usual "Hi, this is how my day was, please pray for me" or talking about serious things that we want others' opinions on.  So... let's take it and run with it.  (And I'm still playing with the template some.  I wanna cut down on some of the pink, for Jesse's sake.)

      Hey Guys, I hope we can chit chat in this here multi-user-chat-blogizzle, and truly bring in the  Perfect Mix  of style, expression, topics, concerns, thoughts, and fellowship (yes fellowship online, its great!). On that note, i begin with this...  "Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the Day approaching."  Hebrews 10:25  I Love my Friends!  (topical post coming soon!)

      This is a story reported to me by a guy who graduated from Georgia Tech, regarding Crusade's Atlanta Christmas Conference:  "The funniest part of Christmas Conference was the we always had this inside joke that (don't let this go to your head) FSU Campus Crusade girls were, by far, the hottest girls at CC. We would always say they had this "aura of invincibility" around them that prevented us from getting within 5 feet of them lest we be struck down. (I'm sure you are laughing at this.)   At the end of each day, we would always tally up how many FSU girls we had talked to, had lunch with, did service work with, rode in the elevator with and declare a winner. It was all really non-serious, just a big inside joke between all of us (very, very single) guys.   I'm still on my fraternity's e-mail list since I'm on the Alumni Advisory Board and I saw this e-mail encouraging guys at the fraternity to go to Chrstmas Conference this year.... yup, some things never change.     Just imagine a place, kinda like heaven (but not quite), where you go and look around....and what do you see? I'll tell you what you see...you see about 800-1000 people worshiping the Lord. And you look closer...and you realize that about 500 of the 800 there are girls...and they're all from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi....and they are all hot. So you think to yourself and ask the guy next to you, "Is this Heaven?" And he replies, "No, it's Atlanta Christmas Conference." And then you ponder the greatness of God because you are surrounded by 500 Christian, hot, hot and Christian, college girls (about half are sorority girls too) in what you conclude must be the throne room of God...or at least what perhaps is a glimpse....   You should go. For nothing else, go see a glimpse of Heaven.  "

      We've been preparing for marriage since we were children.  Some (I) played 'cops and robbers' and learned the importance of right and wrong, good and evil, and that the homefront must be protected against the forces of evil.  Others, (the rest of ya'll on here) perhaps played house or held tea parties or played dress up and pretended to be a bride.    And as I grow older, gain maturity, and the naggings of my mother to hurry up and get married increase in frequency the institution of marriage has been on my mind.  Not all the time mind you, but it has popped up on occasion throughout my recent days.    As happens with maturity the way of preparation for that day that will likely come has changed immensely.  No longer do I run around with a cap gun and a plastic badge and pretend to shoot the neighbor kid carrying his bow and arrow - which is really just a stick with a string tied to it.  Instead I walk my dog and ponder the meaning and nature of love, the gifts and abilities that I can bring to such a relationship, and the question of when I shall meet my future bride (or if I've met her already).    I say that I ponder my gifts for a reason.  Because I know that I'll look for someone to compliment me where I lack, and I seriously lack, and I her.  And I wonder if I'll be so smitten that such practical musings will be quickly forgotten.  So I've got to figure this stuff out way beforehand.    Now so as not to alarm you, I haven't been sitting down and making a list of qualities that my wife should have.  Because I think human beings with their quirks and intricacies are much too complex to be summarized and categorized.  And, well, it's just silly.    My guess is that I'm not the only one here with such thoughts in my head.    But while I can only guess what she will be like, I have slightly more concrete ideas about what life will be like with her.  Though I suppose that those too are too great an assumption.  I don't need a babysitter, or a mommy, or a housekeeper.  I'm looking for a spouse, a wife, a partner, a best friend, and all those other things that go along with that.  She needs to be an encourager, and patient, and able and willing to laugh at my jokes and love my strangeness.    And in return I will be what she needs me to be.  And love her more each day.    *So, that's my first addition to this group thing-a-ma-bob.  Anybody have anything to share on a related matter?*

      Consider Phil 3. and Lk 9.  "But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 8What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ."  "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. "  As most of you know, I asked a question the other day of you. Some have asked about clarifying. I believe I will.  Basically I wanted to know your opinion concerning the following question. How does one live the passionate, "single-minded" life for Him with kids and bills and life's worries and expectations? How can one only be passionate about ONE thing, namely Him, when there is Cheesecake Factory and football and love making? Whenever you hear of the sold out life, you hear of the woman who has never been married serving the poor in Africa. I believe that woman IS living a single-minded, passionate life, glorifying her Creator. But not all are called to this form of passion. This is not logical.  The reason this question plagues me is this. I am at home. I see many bored Christians around me. People seeking adventure in movies, seeking love outside their vows, seeking fulfillment in their refrigerators. Easily, I can become one of these people for a few days before becoming disgusted with myself. I find no coincidence in the end of Phil 3, which describes even down to the specificity of our gluttony (what is the %age of Americans who are overweight? How much is spent on liposuction each year? What is the renowned New Years Resolution?).  "As I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things."   I am officially writing that I officially do not have the answer yet. What am I learning? Well...in brief summary, much. He close and personal.  I can smell the sweetness of His aftershave. I can feel the warmth of His breath. I will let you know what He whispers in my ear when He is finished. That's all I can give. I hope this question burdens you as much as it does me. I believe it is a Christian American epidemic.  GN.

      Hey guys,  I checked my email this afternoon and was surprised when I had a message sent to my school account.  My  urlLink adviser   urlLink died  yesterday afternoon (unexpectedly).  He was only 54 years old, and he leaves behind a wife and a daughter (a student at the University).  He played a big role in the department, and I know I'm not the only who is shocked by this news.  If y'all would, pray for his family and his academic family as well.  From what I understand, he was a Christian man, which is comforting... but he'll be missed, just the same.

      I would have to say I am thankful for my family, health, the clothes on my back and the food in my stomach. I am thankful for all the extra stuff, that many people do not have. I am thankful for my culture, heritage, upbringing. I am very thankful for other cultures, heritages, and upbringings, I am thankful for the perfect mix. I am thankful for many things, I think we all are.  With this season of my life, for the past couple of years I would say that I have utilized a certain resource that I am extremely thankful for. Right now I am most thankful for my wonderflu, lovely, FRIENDS. I am thankful for your ears, that have listened to lots of 'stuff'. I am thankful for your words, that have spoken truth and wisdom into my life. I am thankful for your Hearts, that connect us deeper than any friendships I have known in the past, and I thank you for your life in which we have shared many many fun and exciting times. Thank you my friends, I cant make enough blog postings or say it enough times for you all to understand how much you mean to me, and how much just being there, or being online or talking 'nothings', with me has been a blessing. Words really cant explain the friendship or the familyship whithin the body of Christ, but you all are like family to me... So today know that someone is thanking her lucky stars (God) for you and know that you are loved. Today on Thanksgiving Day, I do declare that I am Thankful for YOU!   "I  thank  my God every time I remember you." Philippians 1:3

      With the continuing onslaught of engagements and weddings, my mind has wandered to thoughts of the marriage I hope will someday exist - my own.  I'm in no hurry to find a pair of rings on my left ring finger, but I'd be lying if I said the thought never crossed my mind.  Just because I don't want it today doesn't mean I don't want it at all.  :)  I've been praying about the  urlLink purpose of marriage  for quite a while, and God has definitely taught me a lot.  Though I know that it was created for God's glory, I forget.  Sometimes I think that it's all about me - heck, sometimes I think  life  is about me.  Fortunately, the people and circumstances around me tell me otherwise.  But for as much as I've been learning, so many questions remain.  The idea that some man will someday be in love with  me  is mind boggling.  It's been strange enough when they've  liked  me, but love?  Even when I see examples of it around me, I have a hard time  urlLink believing that men are capable of love .    Maybe that's why I'm so hung up on the idea of being pursued (or at least, part of why.)  I don't want to be anyone's convenient choice.  I'm generally pretty happy with who I am, but sometimes being reminded that others care about me does me a world of good.  For all my big ideas and rambling thoughts, I'm just a little girl in so many ways!  Another thought has been plaguing me this week.  People always say that when it's right, "you know."     How  do you know?  Are you really certain at the time, or is it only in retrospect that you admit to yourself that you thought he was Mr. Right on your second date?  If you  don't  know, are you wasting time - or is it different for different people?  I'll admit I'm jumping the gun with that question.  I don't need an answer, at least not now.  I don't claim to "know" anything about my future love life.  Right now, I'm taking it one day at a time.  That's all I need to do (and I could give you a list of reasons why - I've got them written out somewhere.  :) )  Still, sometimes I wonder.

      So...  You know Jeanie...I have the SAME questions! If it must be right and it doesn't feel right in the first...eh half hour... move along!? Geez...I can't decide which silverware I'll need for my dinner in that amount of time...  But well it CAN and DOES happen. Tonight as I talked to a friend, I found out that he has been talking to a girl (long distance) for a month. He believes that she may just be the girl he'll marry...after a MONTH! Things are just working out and making sense, and he's laughing because God has answered his prayers so specifically...everything just fits. I think that this is INCREDIBLE. I have watched the Lord call people together. It astounds me. It keeps me in awe of what His love is like. It is pure and beautiful.   However, I am like you baby - I have a hard time believing that it will happen to me. (Probably a good thing as it may NOT happen...in which case no man on Earth could handle the lovin I have to give right?). As far as why I have a hard time believing it. I don't think its anything unhealthy. I typically like myself and actually I think I'd make a pretty kickin wife/mom. I guess I'm just takin it one day at a time, aka I'm single by the grace of God, today. Like you said, a matter of honoring and glorifying Him. That is a hard, unselfish thing to fully realize. Don't think I'm there yet but we are handling it today.   However, I have at least fully realized the folly of marrying marriage...since that is what you DO after college right? What an awful mistake. I mean, if you really wanna put on a white dress and dance around, go for it....but don't go off making vows before God. Those are of some consequence!  And yeah the pursuit thing...I agree. I'll be no consolation prize. If God has a guy picked out for me, he'd better be pretty dadgum head over heals... ;o)   Hmm...soo...reading back on this blog, it's a little silly and alot random...but that would be my mood for the evening! So deal or don't sit at the table...  G'Night friends.

      Hey friends!  It's been awhile, but I have enjoyed catching up by reading your bloggings :)   What a weird, but sweet season singleness is!  Ha!  I have found myself on the good days rejoicing for this precious time Jesus allowes me to spend with Him alone--when my heart is not divided and my desires are for only Him. Then one the not-so-good days, I cry when I think about the bitter lonliness that comes from not having a companion, someone to share my dreams with, someone to help make them a reality, and bring glory to our Father, TOGETHER.  A wise friend of mine once said to me over coffee, "Les, contentment is not saying, 'Oh, I could be single for the rest of my life because I have Jesus.'  Instead it's saying, 'Lord, You are God, and that's enough for the rest of my life, no matter what the circumstances--I WILL trust in You because of Who You are.'"  Learning to be content for the sake of my relationship with Jesus--though I am so far from it--that's what makes this season purposeful.    I totally am all about the being pursued thing.  I trust that just like God formed Eve FOR Adam, He also has purposed relationships to bring honor to Himself and joy to those in the relationship.  So--I will wait with my sisters--not in idleness  but with purpose.  With my eyes concerned with the whereabouts of my King, His kingdom, and His righteousness.  All these things (including that sweet man of mine one day) will be added...  Wait on sweet ladies, wait for Him.  Pray sweet men, pray for wisdom to find her...  Much love from O-town, Les :)

       urlLink CBS.SportsLine.com - Miami, Florida State get unwanted rematch    Miami athletic director Paul Dee agreed that a rematch was far from ideal.   "This is just one of those outcomes where it's not the outcome that everybody wants, but it's certainly a good one," Dee said.   Bowden is 8-13 against Miami since 1983.   Yeah, no wonder Paul Dee thinks it's a good match up.  :P  But heck, at least we're not playing Michigan or Ohio State... those would be meaningless.  This is at least for state bragging rights.    In other news, I'm PUMPED about the Sugar Bowl, and I intend to be cheering for Michigan in the Rose Bowl (sorry Joyce!)

      In the past week, I've had the opportunity to visit with friends old and new.  After a weekend in Nashville with several of the latter and one of the former, I arrived in Florida.  Since then I've been able to see many of y'all, and it's been a good week!  In visiting with everyone, I've been reflecting on the past and how our friendships have developed over the years.  We've grown together in various ways, and that growth continues even now.  But everything's different.  I sat on a couch in Casselberry, Fla., on Thursday night and observed how naturally Joyce interacted with this man that I'd met only hours before.  Sure, she calls him her husband.  But even with those two golden rings on her finger, it was hilarious to see her cuddling him.  Meanwhile, running errands and eating BBQ and seafood with Heather was the same as it always has been.  We're in completely different places than where we've been in the past.  Regardless, friendship endures.  That's true across the board.  We're all growing, and changes are made in the process.  I am not the same girl today that I was this time last year.  I've just completed another semester of graduate school.  But instead of returning home for a semester to figure out where my life is going, I know where I'm at.  We're all growing - at least, I think I am - but it's fascinating to see how our friendships thrive within those new settings.

IF YOUR LITTLE PICTURE THINGY IS ON THE SIDE...THE COMMENT BOX IS NOT FOR YOU. See you have special privileges to be used....you get to POST. WOOO!  So that's the topic NUMBER ONE. Topic NUMBER TWO: Brainstorming topic ideas to be compiled into a list. Silly ones (which we might actually use...BEWARE...) are more than welcome. AGAIN...PLEASE respond with your own DADGUM post. (In other words, don't make me come over there and knock you into next week!)  Other readers without access - thank you for your patience. Please reply in the comment box below. Thank you so much.

      Same Sex Marriage - That is a difficult question to answer. Do I think that there is a legitimate way constitutionally that Same Sex Marriage can be classified as illegal? I do not think that I could support the ban based on that fact alone.  Adoption - I think adoption is good, especially when it saves a child from being needlessly aborted.  Weapons of Mass Destruction - Make love, not War. I am not a fan of War pretty much in every instance so I think we should destroy all weapons of mass destruction, including ours in the United States. If we don't do that here how can we tell/force other countries to do the same? Hyperkalemia - I would recommend eating less bananas to cure this condition.  Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes - I see they are radio people I think. I don't listen to talk radio.  If you could go any place in the World - Hmm..Papau New Guinea, Spain, Ireland, I know, but hey I was a religion major not a math major. Looks like one place to me.  If you could only bring one thing - That is a difficult question, but toothbrush ranks highly on the list.  Saving for the Future - A good idea in theory, but practice makes perfect and I am still in the theory stage.  Clint Black, the best looking man in the world? - He's and old country musician, are you serious? Even looking within country music he would not win that competition. Nashville, the NYC of the South? - Have never been to Nashville, probably will never go.  Sweet Tea for breakfast? - Sweet tea for nothing, I don't touch the stuff.  Your favorite color, flavor, piercing etc... - Colors: Green, Blue, Yellow - Flavor: Chocolate I guess? - Piercing: I have none, some people can carry off a nose piercing well others cannot, the whole eyebrow thing is pretty much out nowadays. totatoo or nottotatoo? a question? - I don't think there is anything that I could see putting on my body forever but I have seen some cool tatoos on other people so I cannot discount the idea entirely Girls with Guitars - I like Jewel, shes a girl with a guitar, well nowadays more seen with a halter top instead of a guitar, but still she aight Girls and their trucks...truly a beautiful thing? - depends on the girl and the truck Jim and Milts...is it really barbeque? - A question that I think I am the least qualified to answer but I will take a stab. They do have the word Barbeque in their name which is the first hint, I don't personally care that much for barbeque so I will say sure they are a barbeque joint. Family Traditions - We watch a Christmas Carol every night before Christmas. We throw easter eggs back and forth on easter my sister and I do in the backyard, or we used to at least.   I hope that answers some of the questions posted. See look at that, and you think that I forgot what a blog was didn't you? Admit, you did, you really did.  Hope you are all having fun. We are wrapping Spring Break up right at this moment, ahh, fun times. I spent the week cleaning my apartment and office and slacking, lots of sleep, lots of X-Box, lots of random nothing.

      As the saying goes...  Just cause you call it a duck, don't mean its a duck unless it's walkin and talkin and stuff...  J.A.M - yes bbq is in the name but please....  Let's go with the wisdom of those who've traveled this road before us. That's right. Wisdom....like they talk about in the first...11? chapters of Proverbs? Right. It's all Biblical and stuff. Argue with that!

      Just 'cause you don't like Jim & Milt's doesn't mean they're disqualified from being a barbecue restaraunt. ;) I'll agree with you that their turkey sandwich doesn't qualify - bbq turkey is not COLD! - but it's still a BBQ joint. And the Yankee sandwich is really good, though I think they should change the name!

      So.  Post "life is a musical" post...(how many times can one post the word post in a post?...hmm...perhaps I'm going postal...let's just chalk it up to posterity as I sit here in my post stand on my posterior...)  Okay, enough posting off the subject... (yes I'll admit that was weird)  Oddly enough I have a rather serious question. Well serious to my mind.  I realized the other day that I have no idea why men want to get married. Like none. All the reasons I have make me want to a) wretch and b) be single forever...so it's safe to say (since marriage is all glorifying to God and stuff) that my assumptions are wrong or at least incomplete. Enlighten me dear friends.  Yep those are my thoughts.  That and I had an antfarm once....them suckers didnt grow shit... ahem...poop. ;o) (just wanted to see the face you'd make)  Out.

      I am sorry it's been so long...I'm not sure if anyone is reading/writing anymore...but I wanted to say hey!  I've been busy.  The walking thing with Vero is awesome...we struggle to get out of bed so early in the morning, but as soon as we've done the first lap around Crane's Roost Park, we're glad we're doing it...the Lord is definitely blessing our time together.  It's accountability like I've never known before.    I am once again stressing financially, so please pray for my time at Olive Garden...I hope business picks up during the holidays, or I'm in serious trouble!  I know God is taking care of every detail of life...it's just a daily discipline to trust Him with my "situation."    What else...umm...oh!  My Student Venture application is officially sent and processing!  I'm really excited about getting started with being an official staff...I'm already putting in the hours it seems, so it'll be nice when it's my only job!  That might be months away, but hopefully the day will come quickly.  I'm really emotionally and spiritually already "there" it seems...my heart so wants to work full time with the girls in my bible study and the other students at Lake Brantley.  Please pray that my heart doesn't run too far ahead of God's hand!   Another exciting thing...we are all praising the Lord for doubling J & A's support this past weekend...so I wanted to join my voice in thanking Him for His timely provision!    Well...that's it for now.  Again, sorry for it being such a long time since i've said a word...i'm a workin' girl!!!  Love ya'll...

      Do you know what really bother's me?!?  Friends who don't respond after an important email, or after a, "Hey, I haven't heard from you or talked to you in forEver, how's it going?" email...I miss people, crave to stay in touch, and only hope the nonresponsiveness is from changed email addresses...  One the better side of my day...I sense that my time in this valley is coming to an end!!  God is taking my hand and leading me up and out of wherever these past few months have led me to.  I am anticipating a time of refreshment and answered prayers.  Veronica and I are going to start prayer walking every M, W, & F...so hopefully this will be good spiritually and physically too.  I finally feel motivated to be a doer...praise the Lord!  Amen...

      this is a p.s. to last night's (or this morning...whoa, 2:15am...) post... I forgot to mention, I dont' know how or why I forgot to mention, but God has specifically used my best friend, accountability partner, partner in crime, my Veronica Lugo in this whole thing with the boy from O.G.  So I don't know if this matters to anyone but me, but I wanted to give glory and honor to God for her...she has since the eighth grade been my bud and since high school been my covenant sister in Christ--always holding me above reproach (or trying to, ha!) and I am better because of Jesus in her through to me.  So...Vero if you ever read my silly bloggings...I love you.  Your friendship is essential in this life and I'm sure the next.  Thank you for holding my hand through this "fall."

      Wow! What a night.  I just ate the new and exciting (but GROSS) Taco Bell Stuffed Chicken Fajita burrito...ehhh...my tummy is rumbling, and I'm thinking this might not sit right (Taco Bell is the only place open this late at night).  But the burrito is not why this night was so cool...I just got home from a long drive back from Lakeland...  A little background on this story...I work at Olive Garden here in Altamonte Springs...and there are three crowds at the O.G.: The partiers/alcoholics, the gays/lesbians, and the Christians.  Ha! I for awhile had been "ministering to" the party people--hanging out with them, going to shoot pool with them, all innocent until I became more-than-friends with a certain guy friend.  So the past couple of months have been difficult because of my own compromising heart...BUT the Lord is SO faithful!!  All I could find myself praying was, "Lord, change my heart."  I felt so numb to conviction, I actually WANTED to be in this "relationship."  After weeks of wrestling with God, He finally answered that prayer.  It felt like it was all in a single moment.  I just all of the sudden was like, "I'm over it.  This is stupid.  I am a child of the Living God, who is IN CHRIST for heaven's sake (literally).  I desire so much more than what I've settled for." So...with that said, part of this whole transition from the party crowd to the godly crowd has been so neat.  I have a good girl friend named Kennika who not only shares in my heart for racial reconcilation, but she has encouraged me through this whole situation with the O.G. boy.  She and others have been my haven at work.  God has used her specifically as my Nathan--keeping me accountable to what I know in my heart is right.  Now, to the point of all of this...really...  In Lakeland was the Passion Tour--with Louie, Todd, and Dave...yeah, we're all on a first name basis now.  Todd said to say hello Debs.  lol :)  It was amazing.  If you don't have the new "Sacred Revolution" CD, go and get it (see my link to GrassrootsMusic.com on the left).  It's one thing worshipping the Lord when you feel good, or when circumstances are nice...but when you've just come out of a serious season of sin...whoa.  That's all I could feel and think tonight in His presence:  Whoa.  So this is what it's all about.  Jesus.  He is more than enough to cover even my deepest, darkest hours.  I (we) HAVE been redeemed...and the effect of the Cross is continual, eternal, everlasting!  O, O Praise Him, He is Holy!  Oh, how constant, how divine, this great song of ours will rise!  Oh how infinitely sweet, this great Love that has redeemed!    So, that's what is going on in my heart tonight...It was like pulling a warm blanket up around my face at night...the final touch to comfort...finally out of the coldness of sin, returing to embrace my First Love once again...this IS infinitely sweet...

      So tonight, right after the "Welcome to the A to the O L" was a surprising, "You've got mail!" (Surprising because I thought only Debbie had this secret email address...).  Oh, but joy was mine when my good 'ol friend Carla Jean emails me to invite me to be a part of the FSU blog!!!  And then to see me already included (where is THAT picture from?!? j/k).  I loved it!!  And yes, Heather, the background is awesome!  I feel loved, included and it makes me miss you all so much more.  Thanks guys!  I'm excited!

      Hello all!  This is my first official "blog" and being new at this and all...I hope to hang with the pro's :)  My good friend and sister Debbie-Anne (who has one of the most amazing hearts I've ever had the privledge of knowing) encouraged me to become a blogger.  I've been said to "go deep in five minutes" so I think this will be good...  My first thought is, "Who the heck said being 22 would be fun/easy?!?"  Nobody said it would be fun being a college grad with no clue what is next or what her degree will be good for.  Nobody told me living at home would be like this...  I am learning a whole heck of a lot during this rough season of life, I am battered and bruised with circumstances that suck...emotions that won't go away...friends that are miles from where I want them to be...but I'm being broken and restored all the same.    I know the Lord will speak through this storm.  I know He will.  I know His faithfulness.  I also know my unfaithfulness though.  My prayer (like David's in Psalm 138:8)  lately has been, "Father please don't abandon the works of your hands..." And I know He won't.  I just feel sometimes like my actions might result in Him saying, "Okay, Les, that's it.  No more chances, Peace out."  Ha!  So glad that's NOT His character.  So thankful He is faithful even when (especially when) I am faithless.    So that's how I'll begin...life stinks right now.  I don't know what I am to do with myself.  Perhaps I need to really surrender.  Perhaps I need to be still.  Perhaps I need Jesus.    I love you Debs.  I am thankful to our sweet Father in heaven for keeping us.  You are my sister and one of my very best friends...here's to the next season(s) of our lives...NY NY :)  Until later my new friends...  ~ Leslie :)

      today at Northland we sang, "Shout to the Lord," and the Holy Spirit of our sweet Jesus did some ministering to my heart...  My Jesus, my Savior Lord, there is none like You All of my days, I want to praise The wonders of Your mighty love.  My comfort, My shelter, Tower of refuge and strength Let every breath, all that I am Never cease to worship You...  Shout to the Lord,  All the earth let us sing, Power and majesty, praise to the King! Mountains bow down, and the seas rejoice At the sound of Your name  I sing for joy at the work of Your hands Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand  Nothing compares to the promise I have In You...  The sermon was about accepting God's forgiveness and moving on to the things He has for me (us) to do in life.  Dr. Hunter gave an analogy about an football player who accidentally picked up a fumbled football and ran into his own endzone, which resulted in serious humilation and guilt.  At half-time, the coach didn't know what to say...he came to the conclusion that the same team that played the first half would play the second.  He looked over at the guilt-ridden player in a corner, with a towel draped over his head.  He lifted the towel up, and said to the crying player, "Did you hear what I said?"  "I said that the same team is playing the second half, that means you."  He said through his tears, "Coach, I can't.  I am so embarrassed.  I have made a laughing-stock of this team, this university...they hate me."  The coach replied, "Son, you're not the first to do what you did.  This game is not over.  I'm your coach and I am NOT pulling you out.  Get out there and do your job."  The player then went out and supposedly played the best game he'd ever played.  He finished strong.    Dr. Hunter then brought it all around to how sometimes we do things that we are really ashamed of--things that make us hide with a tears and a towel over our eyes/head.  We have a Coach, more a Father, that has promised to not pull us from the game.  He has commanded us to get back out there and finish strong, with His help.  He loves us and is not mad at us.  He is disgusted with sin, but not His child.  His forgiveness and work on the Cross is more than enough to redeem us and give us life--every day.  I love that.  That truth of God's amazing love and grace is what keeps me out on the field...

       urlLink    I know it's been awhile, I am sorry for the sporatic updates! Christmas was wonderful. My family is amazing--the boys are hilarious (see picture, this is Marshall, me & Mike), my parents have become my best friends, so the holidays are so enjoyable for us. We had a great day on Thursday. Mike, Marshall and I bought our dad a new grill for Christmas (If anyone remembers my bragging about my dad's cooking, this is HUGE). He has had a little kettle grill for years, and we found a pit barbeque roaster thing at Home Depot for a great price. We snuck it over to Nanny and Pop's house (grandparents) on Tuesday to assemble it and stick a bow on it. He cooks a lamb and a ham every Christmas Day for the entire family, so everyone was there when he went to go onto the back porch to start cooking (he thought we had brought his old grill over). He just stood at the sliding glass door that looks onto the porch with his hands on his hips. He kept repeating, "No way," and, "I can't believe it." He had no idea!!! His eyes watered up (as we had expected...lol), and he embraced us in gratitude. I have never been so excited about giving a gift, or so full of joy seeing someone receive it. After the gifts were opened and the food eaten, we played Pictionary and Password ALL day/night long. It was a great day.   Today, however, I feel weird. A dose of mixed emotions I guess :) The good emotion is that despite how I FEEL, I am sure Jesus loves me. The not-so-good emotion of the day is that I feel like I never catch up with my goals. I am drowning in a nameless sea of funk. I wish I didn't have so much debt. I wish I could make some significant progress financially. I wish I could hang out with people more...I wish people would call to hang out...or I would just call them...i dunno. I just crave fellowship and have been very inconsistent with putting forth effort to make it happen. The list of "I wish's" goes on. I'm not necessariy stressed out...but just feel like I haven't been successful in what I set out to be/do since I've come home. This could be PMS...or just reality of life.   I am excited about the spring. It's nice to birth new things/adventures in life...the next thing is raising support for the Student Venture internship (I had my interview last week, and it went really well!! Praise God!). And moving out sometime soon to live with the Debster...that in itself is enough!!! I'm excited, but anxious at the same time. I am confident the Lord is working, so I will wait on Him for every anxious thought to be turned into peace and then bring forth fruit in my heart--it's all part of this journey, I guess. I am in it for life :)  I love you all, and hope it's not too long before I write again.  Have a wonderful holiday season. &nbsp; urlLink

      Hey Hey!  So tonight we decorated the Christmas tree!  It's the first year we've not had a real tree, so I'm still coping.  :)    I saw some ol' friends tonight--thanks girls for the invite to Chili's (Amanda, Vero & Leah).  I so enjoy catching up on life.  I wanted to share something really neat with you all--I found out that one of my very good friends from early in high school came to know the Lord recently (well, back in September sometime).  How cool is that?!?!  Praise the Lord!  I am just overjoyed to hear that he is now walking with Jesus!    More news--my cousin Corie also accepted Christ the other night at church!  She responded to an invitation at Northland on Monday night.  I have been spending a lot of time with her lately and am really enjoying getting to know her again. Please pray for her growth and someone to come along to disciple her.  We are looking for a good bible study for her to get into.   I also wanted to clarify, if it's needed, I'm only going on staff as an intern for a year with Student Venture!  The Lord hasn't really confirmed official staff yet...though it's most definitely an option...so heather, pray that one day we'll REALLY be "Staff Sisters"!!!  he he   well...that's it for now!  I hope all is well with each of you!

      Happy New Year friends!   Today's news is that Debbie and I are apartment hunting...she is also job hunting...if you guys could keep us in your prayers (especially the job thing for Debs).  We're excited!  There are mixed emotions on both sides, I think...fear, excitement, anxiety about finances, etc.  I know everything will work out.  I hope the transition is smooth for both of us.

      Well...Debs and I are only about a week and a half away from being roomies again!  Praise God! We're getting really excited.  I am finally ready to be out there on my own again!  I think... lol  There is so much to say...do you ever wish we could all just have a monthly meeting somewhere to catch up on each other's lives, to spend time together just because...and it would only take a few minutes to drive to that spot...no matter where we came from whether Orlando, Tally, or Alabama?  Umm...I miss you...until we find that place...  i love you...  ~ les :)

      man....it's been too long.  I am sorry for not committing to this thing.  It just hasn't been priority.  things are crazy here.  I am hard-pressed on every side it seems.  my best friends are here, only minutes from me, and i can't seem to find time to spend with them.  the guest at olive garden see more of me than my closest do.  what have i become?  i want a real job.  i am not going to be interning with Student Venture until later on, if ever, and i now am confused at what the lord is doing...though i trust him completely...it's just a little fuzzy.  i am reminded to, "be strong and courageous."  Courageous for what? I ask Him.  Well, because of Who said it I guess.  No other reason given yet.  Trust and obey.  Nothing else.  He will lead, I will go, that's all i need to know.  Anyone feeling me out there?  holla back, ya'll.  i know i've neglected you, but forgive!!!  please!!!  lol... i love you all and miss you much.

      what a beautiful day this is...I woke up this morning first to Debbie calling me on my cell (she's across the living room in HER room) to tell me to get up...lol...then realized that the sun was shining VERY brightly through my big window!  We have a "lake view" (it's really just a bunch of trees) but it's better than the parking lot!  I left my window open last night because it's been cool here in Orlando, so along with the sun was a crisp morning breeze that tickled my nose!  I rolled over and flipped to Psalm 17 and read, "When I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing Your likeness." My heart rested and I pulled up my covers around my chin...sweetness...I love Him so much!!!  Anyways...we're finally here!!!  Roomies again, now residing at Camden Renaissance apartments, in lovely Altamonte Springs, FL.    urlLink      Stop by for some coffee sometime soon...

      There is something sweet about old friends in new settings and new friends in old settings.  Like tonight, I met with a old friend who I went to high school and college with.  We met for dinner downtown, in "Thorton Park" -- I've so never even seen anything like this place in Orlando, and I grew up here! I felt like I really was 23, single, and living in Orlando!  Such a difference from what I remember of this place back in high school. (Thanks, Mike!)  Then there are the new friends in places that are so familar to me, like my new girlfriends in my homegroup, from the church my family has been going to for almost 7 years...  I never would've guessed I'd end up here...  I also had the thought today that it has officially been "over" a year since I graduated from FSU last May (2nd to be exact).  I've left my Eygpt, so to speak, and have found myself wandering in some uncomfortable desert.  This place is boring, dry, and I'm growing very faint.  BUT there is something, or Someone, rather, that makes the journey through this desert okay. I told my friend tonight that I'm bored.  Bored with the waiting room the Lord has me in right now.  I am sitting here, with my numbered ticket in hand, getting extremely restless in my seat.  When is it going to be my turn?  When will all my visions for student ministry, love, LIFE going to come to fruition?  As I write these words, I hear a gentle Voice remind me that "LIFE" is happening now...that this desert or whatever I called it, that is has some significant purpose, and if I would just be still, I might catch it.  I wish I could, be still that is.  I wish it was easier for me.  I dream big and forget that there is much to do while I wait for His timing for all those areas of life.  I remember when He brought the principle of "waiting well" to me...my good friend, Will, used to talk about this constantly.  Will, if you ever read this silly bloggings, isn't it funny that what we learned last summer is really playing out now a year later?!?  :)  Now it's time to really walk in what the Lord taught us then...  With all the changes that this year has brought on--from the big mistakes and compromises I made last fall, to the "Waiting Room" I feel I've found myself in now--Jesus has remained so faithful.  He has been my Rock.  I've experienced His consistency in the midst of my inconsistency.  He has not changed.  He has continued to show me amazing grace, undeserved love, and extreme patience...   goodnight friends...you're in my prayers...those of you in Brazil, Barbados, Connecticut, Alabama, Tally, NC, Miami, and here in Orlando...i love you and am thinking about you.    always, les :)

      Shane & Shane, "Bob", and Jesus... the infamous men in my life...  oh, the joy of relationships. my heart is weak and my flesh even more pathetic...but life goes on and God is faithful. though there is no "relationship" with Shane &amp; Shane, Veronica and i DID get to hang with Shane E's wife, Kelly, at the Cornerstone Festival last weekend...so we're making our way "in" with the boys!! lol and even though we're not officially "in" yet, i still know deep down in my heart that it's meant to be...Shane and i...lol...just kidding. on the real, the show was amazing, it was more a time of worship, and a much needed time in the presence of the other Love of my life, the first Love, Jesus. Speaking of...this mysterious Man of mine...He is continually beside me and I am thankful that He has carried me through these past couple of months, as they have been some of the most emotional ones in a long time. I am reminded that His love is everlasting, it's patient, and sweet. It satisfies like none other and I am desperate for more. I fall soooo incredibly short of deserving any attention of His, but He chooses in faithful love to remain. As Shane would say, "This feast, is at the feet of the Richest of Fare."  Then there is "Bob" -- don't know if I've yet shared with all of the world about my "Bob". Vero, should I even categorize him as a "Bob"? (For those who are asking, "What the heck is a Bob?", it is what Veronica and I used to call our crushes, or "temporary emotional obligations" during our adolescent years...in hopes to escape actually revealing the name every 5 seconds!) i have a "friend" that i don't really know too well yet...but he's wonderful :) and i'm excited about knowing him one day...and i'll leave it at that...more details to come when they actually occur...  And now that I tried to write that he's a "Bob" I dunno if that's so much the truth, because "Bob" entails some sort of crush status...which this is not for sure. He's a friend. I'm NOT dating anyone...nor will I be at some certain date in time...I'm trying my best to be obedient to what the Lord has called me to do, and that being, in short, "Die." "Die to your own will, your own timing...SURRENDER to Mine." What the heck do you suppose I do in response to THAT?!?! Obey. It's my only option. I've read that Someone else died in order to truly live...and if I would tread up this hill in my heart and bring my "Isaac" (my will) up to the altar, and give it up completely, I will be truly free. Free to grow, free to minister effectively, free to truly LIVE...  There is a comfort in surrendering to Jesus...a sweet release...i'm experiencing that in a unique way right now. It's like letting go of an idea you've held onto and falling helplessly into the Arms of a love that is deeper than your imagination could ever take you...  I can't say much more...I just thought I'd plead for your prayers: Pray for the loves in my life...(okay, you don't have to pray about me and Shane Barnard...) just pray for the only Love that concerns me now--pray that I cast vision about my life partnership with Jesus, that I would fully experience Him walking beside me at the parties I go to solo, at the weddings this summer when I start to feel alone, or when my "Bob", or rather, my "friend" calls me once again...and that whole friendship has liberty to grow...pray for peace and love to abound in my heart all the more in depth of insight...insight into who Jesus is, who He desires me to be, and who He desires to touch through my small life...  I love you all and am praying for you too...  peace~ leslie diane

      I'm reading a new book. Have you ever heard of Tommy Tenney? He wrote "God Chasers" and "God Catchers" and has written a new book called, "Finding Favor with the King: Preparing for Your Moment in His Presence." It is a walk through the story of Esther...the Queen of King Xerxes in the Old Testament book of Esther. This woman is quality! She was patient and passionate about her calling in life...she left no room for compromise or complacency. I'm only in the third chapter, but it's amazing to be reminded about the "protocol of the Palace" and remember the majesty of the King we are seeking to find...He is high and lifted up, and we are invited personally into His presence, BUT only by the blood of Jesus! It is a miracle that we're even in the inner courts...   I've realized that like Esther, my very best is nowhere good enough for the Palace, or namely, the King. She was a peasant Jewish girl, not a Persian princess! She came into the king's palace intially "smelling like the farm" but after a year of preparing to be presented to Xerxes, she was cleaned up and smelled a lot different because of his purposes in her life. She, in one single moment, became second in command to an entire nation...all because her heart was bent on "loving the king" worshipping him and seeking him instead of what he could offer her. The question presented in the second chapter is, "How do you prepare for your moment in the King's presence" and evenmore, "Why?" Why did Esther spend 12 months (Esther 2:12) in intense preparation for her moment in front of Xerxes' throne? I've been pressed to think about my King...and my dedication to this preparation for  our  "moment"...where is  my  heart? Am I seeking to worship Him for who He is or for the "splendor of His Palace"?   Why prepare? There is something special about this King...I haven't discovered it all, but there has got to be something special about Him. He is not like the guys in my life who disappoint me and are a source of heartache... He  sees my heart, holds it, and heals it completely. He understands my fears--of rejection and failure. He sees and understand me completely.  Completely . Hagar in the OT called Him, "The LORD who sees me" (Genesis 16:13), and I believe she experienced an all-knowing, intimate King who knew her more than Abram, more than any other man she knew, or ever would.   Tonight...it's late, and I should be sleeping. But I can't help but ponder in my heart, though it's hurting, the mystery of His love. My heart has failed (again), and I'm not surprised, but He is still here.  Completely .

       urlLink    "Heaven forbid familiarity...to keep me from Your majesty..." Shane & Shane sing this morning, as I wake and read that if I "seek, then [I] will find..." (Luke 11:9) and then words like, "Put down your paper plate...come to the Table made...Deep blue china found on the Table by the wine...So fine..."    I've shared about this "desert way" of waiting on the Lord...and I this song has been a vehicle of helping me identify exactly what's it's been like:                                                                 Oh, I miss You so The feel of forever Oh, the taste I know It hurts to remember Unfortunately high Ironically dissatisfied I miss You I miss You  I had a fleeting thought this morning And I mentioned You today It breaks my heart to just know You in part And not to be with You where You are  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I miss Him. I miss the Feast I once feasted on.  This desert way provides nothing but manna in the morning & meat at night--it is what I'm given now, and it's enough, it's exactly what I need.  "No more or no less."  But...Oh, the Feast.  I crave the Richest of Fare.    I got a taste this past week in Myrtle Beach with Student Venture.  I hate to say it was b/c of an event.  But sometimes I believe the Lord takes me away to remind me of my need for Him and to deepen the desires for "fine china and wine."  My youngest brother, Marshall, shared his faith with over 25 people on the beach last week.  The Lord allowed him to share the joy of leading a few of those guys to Himself!  Praise God!  I can't begin to share how much of a blessing it is to see your little brother grow and share his faith...it's amazing.  In addition to that, I got to spend some QT with the girls from Brantley.  I am convinced this is what I was created to do...sit on the beach (lol)...talk about this man Jesus...encourage young women to seek purity and righteousness...it's fulfilling.  "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord...  Back to Luke 11:9..."Seek and you will find..."  Beauty for ashes, a garment of praise for my heaviness...seek these with me and we will find the Richest of Fare waiting to pour Himself all over us...  Oh, Yesh'ua You  are  the greatest taste...  Amen      &nbsp; urlLink

      I recently looked back on my journals from when I was in Tallahassee last year (May, 2003). There was an afternoon, a couple of days after graduation, when I was at the Christmas house, after my family had left town. I sitting on their most comfortable couch, praying about the road ahead...And my prayers were hopeful, but still mixed with a little fear/anxiety about "going home" instead of going to seminary in Louisville, KY. He had changed my heart. He had re-directed my steps and given me a peace about going home to Orlando. But I looked ahead and didn't know what to do...didn't have a job lined up...only a summer staff deal with Impact Ministries (which turned out AWESOME!). So I dreaded August. I prayed that if I did "get out of the boat" and walk towards where I saw Jesus beckoning me to come, then I expect it to be safe. Ha!  Teri came in the room, sat down next to me on the couch, and handed me a cup of hot Starbucks coffee. She smiled the, "I'm-about-to-tell-you-what-you-don't-want-to-hear" smile, as if to know exactly what I had been praying about, and said, "Les, you're going to have to be willing to fail or fall." I quickly responded, "What?!?" She answered, "You're going to have to step out of the boat, walk on the water towards Jesus, and    surrender the idea of a perfect journey   ." Oh. That statement and that coffee rocked my world. She added, "Like Peter, you're going to have to choose where you want to ultimately be, within your comfort zone, or out on the water with the One who knows exactly what is going to happen next. Because the adventure is out there, on the water,  really  walking by faith...even if you do start to "sink" sometimes.   To be with Jesus will be worth it  ." So, I cried a little and then decided that I would gird myself for whatever "going home" would bring. I said to the Lord (and to Satan), "Bring it on!"  Now...over a year later...I laugh at that memory because, though it gave me perspective, I was not prepared for what lied ahead. In one word (or two)--Olive Garden. AKA the pit of hell. ( lol) Mistakes and compromises. A broken spirit. A broken heart. It sucked. I failed at ministering to the people He put in my life...I misrepresented Christ to the guests more than half the time...and I don't know if I've left any good thing there. Tomorrow night, however, is my "last night" there full-time. The Lord has provided a way out.  I got a phone call last week from a job I applied for months ago. The Geneva School has offered me a job as a "teacher's assistant" for the fall. They are aware of my desire to go on staff with Crusade/Student Venture. They are going to give me pretty much full-time hours. It's totally a God-send. I'm amazed at how God in His total sovereignty had the timing of this perfected long ago. He knew my heart would be hurt and hardened (because I suck sometimes at walking in the Spirit, and therefore end up sinning like crazy). He knew I would be at the end of my rope...I prayed only hours before that phone call from Geneva last Thursday, "Lord, I have nothing left to give. I'm empty-handed. I am done trying." And then, only then, did He begin to open these doors with Geneva. So...with my hard heart desperately crying out to be softened by His touch...He's assigned me to KINDERGARTENERS. Gentle, innocent, tender-hearted kindergarteners. Mom said last night, "Isn't it neat how He would bring these little children into your life to bring about healing and teach you again what it means to love and trust like they do?" I'm overwhelmed with awe at His love for me that He'd do that...  This passage from Psalm 103:1-5 has meant a lot to me this year...      "Praise the LORD , O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the LORD , O my soul, and forget not all his benefits- who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's."         ...I will fear no evil."     Finally Renewed,   Leslie Diane :)

      &nbsp;  I am hard-pressed.&nbsp; (I feel like my blogs are always sad, always full of complaining or whining and/or "woe is me" talk, and for that I'm sorry...)&nbsp; Nevertheless, woe is me.&nbsp; Woe is my weak heart.&nbsp; Woe is my fragile and fickle mind.&nbsp; Woe is my inability to walk by faith in a Man who has proven Himself countless times to be the most dependable person in my life.&nbsp; Woe is me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've been rejected by boys, under-tipped at work, burnt out in relationships, and used for false intimacy...and it sucks.&nbsp; I just want someone to understand and  really  know me...and to return that to someone else.&nbsp; I want to find what I've found in Christ in a godly man.&nbsp; Where for art thou, Romeo? :)  &nbsp;  And to add to all of my whining, I've realized I have not truly served anyone but myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You see, in my wallowing self-pity, my sweet Savior has gently reminded me of my destructive pride.&nbsp; This consuming "Me-ism" has resulted in a self-absorbed attitude that I'm ashamed to say is my own.&nbsp; I've become so self-centered it's ridiculous.&nbsp; Me, me, ME.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  MY heart.&nbsp; MY life.&nbsp; MY dreams.&nbsp; MY needs.&nbsp; MY money.&nbsp; MY time.&nbsp; MY strength.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    "...You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God..." (1&nbsp;corinthians 6:19-20)&nbsp;    &nbsp;  My prayer tonight is that I would honor Jesus, because the price was costly...His blood was not in vain.&nbsp; He suffered so I wouldn't.&nbsp; He endured so I could rest.&nbsp; He served, loved, and obeyed the Father even when circumstances weren't comfortable, so I would know what it would look like.&nbsp; I want to honor Him who I see bent down in front of me, with MY dirty, dusty feet in HIS hands...washing them and commanding me to do the same to those He's put in my life...  &nbsp;  So it (the Tenney book)&nbsp;says..."Work at your relationship with God.&nbsp; Don't give up."&nbsp; And&nbsp;the word of the Lord through Lefevre preaches lately, "Fight to believe."&nbsp; I know this place of battling for strength...lately&nbsp;I've realized&nbsp;the battle is won in realizing that the "strength" is not&nbsp;going to come from within myself, but only in resting in the arms of&nbsp;my Father in heaven...crawling up into His lap and laying my head on His shoulder...believing that,  "In repentance and rest is [my] salvation, in quietness and trust is [my] strength..." (isaiah 30:15) The belief&nbsp;that He will sustain me is somewhere deep down in my soul...it's been difficult to muster up, but it remains, because I hear Him say on days like today, "Remain in My love, Les,   epimeno  ..."  &nbsp;  Oh, Sweet Jesus, sigh over me, open my eyes and help me see others instead of myself...I want to wash their feet instead of constantly pampering my own...  &nbsp;  Amen.&nbsp;

      Tonight I sat at beautiful Lake Eola in the rain. It wasn't so much on the "beautiful" side of things, save the fact that I was sitting with a couple of wonderful friends, watching a not-so-wonderful fireworks display, and  still  enjoying every minute of it. Thanks, Heather for the romance of today/tonight...it was such a blessing to spend the day with you.   Every 4th of July has been so different...among my favorites have been last year in Mt. Dora (the fireworks over the lake were incredible and the company was cute:); Ft. Myers a couple years ago on the beach with my family; then there was the Keith Urban concert at FSU one year...all unique in themselves, great memories, good times.   As I sat in traffic on my way home tonight I had one of those cheesy "freedom-God-bless-America" moments when I started to ponder the wonderful gift we have as a nation. I often take for granted my freedom...the freedom I have to wake up each morning and choose what to believe, who to spend time with, where to go, when/where to hold a bible study, etc. Then that random cheesy thought went to how often I take for granted my spiritual freedom in Christ. Oh, boy. I have to be careful to not beat myself up, but I realized that days go by when I "forget the [Man] who died and gave that right to me" -- I forget that in Him there is true FREEDOM. Freedom from the darkness of sin, freedom from the depression of "acedia" or spiritual melancholiness...(any Northlander's with me?!? We learned about "acedia" today:), freedom from eternal death, freedom from what I deserve...   So, Praise God today of all days for His gift of freedom! Christ has set us free! I have no clue why at 11pm on a Sunday night that thought excites me and brings a smile to my face, but it does. We have been brought into a glorious freedom that is in Christ (Romans 8:21)!   This verse from Galatians 5:1 comes to mind as I lay my head down to sleep,  "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free, stand firm then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."    My prayer tonight is that I will run this race with endurance, that I will remember my freedom when I wake tomorrow, and I will walk, or run rather, in it doing everything possible to avoid situations and things that might bring my own "yoke of slavery" back onto my shoulders. Goodnight sweet friends, you're in my thoughts and prayers tonight, may the Lord bless you and keep you...   standing firm,  freely ,  leslie :)

      And He  will  give you the desires of your heart." It has taken me such a long time to get even a tiny grasp on this promise. I just don't get it sometimes. What does it mean to truly "delight"? What are the desires of my heart these days? They seem to change every 5 minutes. Will both the delighting and the desiring ever be consistent? What is delight, anyway? I imagine a little boy in kindergarten--the look on his face and the emotion in his heart--when his mother returns to pick him up after his first day of school. Or the face of a new bride on the dawn of the first day with her new husband as they awake entangled in each other's embrace. Or perhaps the feeling you get when you're zooming through the air on Dragon named, "Ice", going millions of miles an hour...I dunno.  What I do know that delight involves an incredible rush...a rush of emotion, physical motivation, and spiritual satisfaction that can only come from above. The hebrew word for delight is,  anag,  and it means literally,  "to treat the object of your affection with delicacy. To be happy over, to take exquisite delight"  (Strongs Hebrew Dictionary). It's how you respond when the sweet touch of Jesus reminds you that He's in control, and whatever it is that we feel you have to figure out, the outcome will be good, because He is good. Then the result of that rush, is His desires for our lives becoming reality. If we could make it an equation, I totally believe it would be:    Surrender + Delight = Desires        When we completely surrender, our next response tends to be looking into the face of the Lord, and then comes the rush...the delight of His presence, His touch, His smile. Then...oh, the desires that perhaps you've forgotten start to flood your mind and heart. You're reminded of what it is you've been created to do or be. You're reminded of the dreams He planted in your heart years ago. And the circumstances of that particular moment, "happen" to line up perfectly with those dreams. And it clicks. Checks right in your spirit. And you think to yourself, "This is it. This is from Him. It's right."  As I stumble through the lines in trying to describe what this past week has been like, I am confident that for the first time in an entire year (if not more) I have   peace  . The kind that surpasses your understanding. I'm sure that Geneva is where I'm supposed to be...and I'm sure that the time of "waiting" is finally over. "Waiting Well" is a discipline I hope to always practice, but the specific command to wait on going to seminary and pursuing teaching is finally over. I've been given the "go" by the Lord. He's opened a door and is leading me through it. It's amazing.  So...that probably leaves most of you with the question, "Well, what about Student Venture?" The answer...I'm going to remain doing the things I do with them but just not on staff. Ministry with SV is definitely a priority in my life and heart...but I've discovered a turn in the road, and I cannot  not  turn...  So, here's to the next season! Delight with me...discover His desires for our lives...and follow your dreams when they finally come (or come  back ).  With one hand in His, Leslie Diane :)
