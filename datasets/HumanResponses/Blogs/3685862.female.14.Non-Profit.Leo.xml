      There was an announcement two weeks ago (as of this writing) that there will be a new dog in our house. My younger brother Jed and my parents were very excited. My older brother Ralph was (and still) a chicken for every kind of dogs. I was disappointed about the news. Besides, the two dogs in our house are very difficult to handle and while my favourite dog is a common  askal  (or street dog) named Climber (with a very sharp "b"), I was afraid to replace him with a cute and plushy bubblegum dog. I told Jed, "Hey, we have two dogs to take care and if we add one, things are getting tougher!" The result: he started to give up the dog and when my mother knew, she ordered her older sister Tita Jenny, the real owner of the dog to bring it to their youngest sibling, Tita Joy.  Tita Joy also took care of the third dog Jenine, who is the second living dog Jed has. Unlike my family, her entire family she's living with now are dog lovers and their home has a better environment for dogs than ours. She has a lot of dogs at their garage. All of them are caged. It is definitely safe enough that their garage isn't look like a dog prison centre.  Anyway, I felt comfortable having two dogs outside the sheltered house. But since Jenine is pregnant, I have two options for my bi-monthly cigarette breaks: either I smoke at the frontyard at the time my parents will never arrive, or give it up. My mother would blame me for the big bullmastiff's miscarriage and her pregnancy depression... if she knew finally that I have a stick of Morris Phillips and an unused pack of Malboro Lights in my secret stash box, and if she knew I smoked at the back yard. I felt more comfortable with one dog.  Yesterday, a plushy mongrel arrived. By a second, I felt very terrible, as if I mourned a cat. The dog in a box smelled like puke because she really pukes, and she's too horrible. When my yaya, Ate Girly opened the box, the dog popped out and she kept staring at the chocolatey Climber, who just arrived then. Now, we have a chocolate flavoured dog, mocha and milkshake.   Jed told me the dog's name is Johnny. I instantly got mad because I want to suffocate my brother or squeeze his neck until his eyes turn red. Before, I named the second dog "Climber" after he was locked up on the prison cell (a.k.a. the dog house) and climbed on the door until he escaped and ran while it was raining and hid under the bench. My mother's eldest brother Tito Lito named the bullmastiff "Jenine" before he brought her from Isabella to Metro Manila. But when Jed gaver her a very stupid name, I got so enraged. I knew she shouldn't give a chance to name our dogs except his bvery own because he's a jackass. He sometimes gave them names like "Stupid Loser" or "Pangit" without any significance. However, I have to call her by a nickname if I don't want to call her by her official name. I can call her "Puti" since she's the milkshake, but what if her colour changes? So as a former viewer and still a fan of the retro family sitcom "The Brady Bunch" and my favourite characters Maria, Jan and Greg, I named the dog "Jan".  Jan loves to bite and piss on the floor (i.e. not in the toilet tile). She's fluffy and looks like a wolf. Anyway, I'm going to teach her Russian.  I wish I have a cat.

        Addicted to art films (or non-Hollywood films, mostly foreign films dubbed or subtitled into English), I started to collect VCDs of them and wondering if I can order some of DVDs in an online DVD store. The first VCD ever to include in my collection is "Le fabeleux destin d'Amelie Poulain" or more popularly called as "Amelie" because of such a long yet nonsense title. That was followed by Pierce Brosnan's non-controversial Irish flick "Evelyn", "Russkies" (where Joaquin Phoenix was Leaf Phoenix), German advertising comedy "Viktor Vogel: Commercial Man", "Not One Less", "L'abuberge espangole" and the very disturbing teen drama "Thirteen". Oh yeah, did I mention "The Zookeeper"?      Anyway, I heard that ordering DVDs online is great and more convienient. I want to try this thing. The problem is that online DVD stores only accept credit cards and I don't have one. That's why people who can't stand to own a credit card do their global movie hunt by going to a foreign land asking for a certain movie, and that's less organized yet whoopingly expensive. (You can buy tons of DVDs online with your global movie hunt expenses that can even lead you to nothing).      However, thanks to the trend of fake DVDs, people can buy their long-lost favourite foreign flicks and buy even more interesting ones. Plus, most pictures are clear and not only it includes only in English subtitles but in Malay, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. But if you ask me to buy them, I'll just simply refuse.  Why? In my opinion, art films tend to get ugly with pirated DVD bargains and it destroys the player easily because of a cheap DVD its ugliness used. Thankfully, the real company who makes real video and audio CDs tend to produce some, however very few legal CDs available in cheaper fake-outs. Some examples are "Thirteen", "Le rivere crimsons", "Real Women Have Curves" and others.
