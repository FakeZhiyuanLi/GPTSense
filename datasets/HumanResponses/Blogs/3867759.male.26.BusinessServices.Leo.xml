      i worked a long, long day today at work.&nbsp; but got the call tonight, and tommorrow i go back on set.&nbsp; really interested in finding out more about this arrest situation.&nbsp; hopefully more will be clear tommorrow night.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  took this photo while driving home tonight.&nbsp; my camera-phone doesn't do it justice, but the sky was this cool, surreal color.&nbsp; made me think of the movie,  urlLink 'What Dreams May Come' .   lately i've been listening to the  urlLink Vines  often.&nbsp;&nbsp;we  urlLink saw  them last in March with Jet...interesting show, and at the time i was kind of pissed because 90% of&nbsp;the songs the Vines played were from their&nbsp;new&nbsp;disc, which at that time was not even out yet.&nbsp; but now, reflecting back, it's good they did that.&nbsp; lots of good songs on album two, that at first listen i dismissed.&nbsp; i&nbsp;highly suggest giving it a go.&nbsp; track four has been on repeat the last two days...    &nbsp; Look through me because I am transparent     Ought to know me but why even know yourself     I'm beginning to need all that I can't have     I'm succeeding to speak like I'm fucking mad     Looking at the autumn shade     You are white and I am grey     Looking at the autumn shade, oh yeah      &nbsp;

      well, it's all over the news.&nbsp; Anthony Anderson and Wayne Witherspoon were  urlLink arrested  last night on the 'Hustle' set for apparent sexual assault.&nbsp; i haven't been on the main set all week, but i find this hard to digest.&nbsp; Spoon (what Witherspon goes by) is one of the nicest guys i've personally ever met, and in no way comes across as someone who would do anything like this.&nbsp; this is the guy that i report to every time i go on set...basically he's my boss.&nbsp; and Anthony...sorry...i just don't see it.&nbsp; this whole mess smells more and more to me about some girl who saw lawsuits and dollar signs.&nbsp; i may be wrong, but that's my initial feeling.&nbsp; we'll see in the end.&nbsp; and i have no clue what this means for production.  i realized today that i haven't watched  urlLink Conan  in almost 6 months.&nbsp; what's wrong with me?&nbsp; i may need to see a doctor or something.&nbsp; i damn well need to get my priorities straight.&nbsp; and soon.&nbsp; on that note, Bob Newhart is on Letterman tonight.&nbsp; he's old.&nbsp; very old.&nbsp; as in 'old enough for me to remember his show as a kid' old.&nbsp; that's old.   urlLink 'Before Sunset'  finally opens here this weekend.&nbsp; that means a definite trip to Midtown.&nbsp; who will accompany me?  i had a lot to say today, but&nbsp;now i'm drawing&nbsp;blanks.&nbsp; this whole arrest news has gotten me down.&nbsp; you can blame my empty thoughts on that.&nbsp; i just hope to know more tomm...&nbsp;

      well tonight i planned to change my blog address from&nbsp;jagsworld.blogspot.com to&nbsp;jasongoode.blogspot.com, but apparently that's not gonna happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;some Canadien dude with my name has already registered that domain.&nbsp; and get this...he's posted once...EVER!&nbsp; i couldn't think of any other name, so no change for the time being.&nbsp; why the change, you ask?&nbsp; well, eventually i want to have  urlLink www.jasongoode.com , and this&nbsp;would be the&nbsp;natural progression towards that.&nbsp; if anyone out there reading knows much about getting your own domain site, let me know.&nbsp; i basically want this page to be located at the mentioned address, but am not sure how to do that just yet.&nbsp;   below are some pictures i took on set late last week.&nbsp; enjoy.&nbsp; i'll take my new camera sometime soon and take better photos.&nbsp;

      i don't know what's in the air, but Memphis is getting decent  urlLink concerts  in the next few months.&nbsp; who would have ever thought that!?!&nbsp; first comes the news that the  urlLink Allman Bros  and  urlLink Lynyrd Skynyrd  are playing together at  urlLink Mud Island  (which happens to be the best place to see a concert in the city, although it's never used anymore).&nbsp; pencil me there, damn't.&nbsp; then i hear that Ani DiFranco's playing the  urlLink New Daisy .&nbsp; now i'm not really a fan of Ms. DiFranco, but it is&nbsp;interesting that she's playing Memphis.&nbsp; Finally, the big news bulletin... urlLink Ryan Adams  will be here on Sept. 14 at the New Daisy.&nbsp; Mr. Adams NEVER plays here, so this is definitely something to grin about.&nbsp; I've never seen the guy live, but have heard many many stories of how grand his shows tend to be.&nbsp; although i have most of his albums burned, my plan is to buy one each week leading up to the show...we can call it  Ryan Adams Appreciation Month , or something to that effect.&nbsp; Add to all this, the opening of  urlLink FedExForum  and shows for Incubus, Usher, Norah Jones and a rumored Van Halen show (no Diamond Dave, but still good news), this fall is possibly shaping up to be "perty nice, indeed!"&nbsp; now let's just hope the supposed  urlLink 50th Anniversary of Rock and Roll fest  is as big as those in the know say it is.   i got  urlLink 'The Dreamers'  in from Netflix today and planned to watch this evening, but like most planned things go in my life, it never materialized.&nbsp;   being off the 'Hustle & Flow' set for the last few days has afforded me to catch up on my REAL job, not that that's a good thing.&nbsp;   Epiphany No. 1:&nbsp; Must save money quickly.  Epiphany No. 2:&nbsp; Must move out of Memphis in January 2005.&nbsp;   everything else is secondary right now.   anticipate an audioblog soon.&nbsp; i feel it coming...

      i got my new digital camera about a week ago.&nbsp; so far, it's been cool, but for me to act like i've used it much would be lying.&nbsp;&nbsp;apparently the camera&nbsp;and my computer are not getting along properly.&nbsp; every time i try to&nbsp;connect it&nbsp;thru the USB port, it locks everything up.&nbsp; i'll get it sorted out soon...   i must report that i&nbsp;broke even last night at the casino, which is better than last time.&nbsp; this gentleman sitting beside me all night kept giving me pointers, which in turn kept chips in front of me.&nbsp; you gotta understand that i'm not related to  urlLink Kenny Rogers , therefore i have no gambling intuition.&nbsp; we saw some old friends from high school.&nbsp; all around good times, except for my friends who left   EARLY  .&nbsp; never leave a party, gathering, get-together, activity, meeting early.&nbsp; all it does is piss everyone else off.&nbsp; write that down...   after leaving the casino, we mistakenly went down to Beale St.&nbsp;&nbsp;i say mistakenly because&nbsp;we didn't realize how things down there were&nbsp;on Saturday nights these days.&nbsp; i felt a little out of place, to say the least.&nbsp; at one point, my friend from Nashville said, "i didn't realize Memphis was so ghetto!"&nbsp; that observation alone captured the entire brief trip.&nbsp; at the same time, it was good to see that the pretentious crowd still flocks to  urlLink Pat O's .&nbsp; you gotta love the atmosphere thats formed when you're stuck in the midst of guys who think they're cooler then everyone else and girls who think they'er hotter than than everyone else.&nbsp; something about that and a cup of coffee makes me love being in my 20s...   i just caught the end of  urlLink 'Cabin Fever' ...and while i must admit that the image of a naked girl in a tub is definitely a good thing, when she has open, flowing wounds, it's not nearly as easy on the eyes.&nbsp; thanks, but no thanks...   listening to LAUNCHcast radio via Yahoo Messenger while online is slowly becoming a hobby of mine.&nbsp; too bad all the stations aren't open.&nbsp; i usually stay dialed into 'indie rock.'&nbsp; there's good stuff there.&nbsp; dig in...

      i haven't been able to post lately due to all the odd hours worked on 'Hustle & Flow.'&nbsp; the last few nights we've wrapped after 5 am, so my sleep schedule has been real interesting.&nbsp; also, we've been shooting in the hood, and skinny white boys and the hood were not always the best of friends, if you know what i mean.   last night i had a heart to heart talk with  urlLink Paula Jai Parker .&nbsp; not that i needed it, but she really further inspired me to pursue this acting dream i'm currently riding on.&nbsp; she, like others, kept harping on the fact that i've got the so called 'look' to make it out there, and all it takes is picking up and getting my ass to LA.&nbsp; i'm gonna do it, and it more and more looks like i'm gonna do it in January.&nbsp; Paula also gave me some pointers on places to live and work in order to BE SEEN by the right folks.&nbsp; she went as far as to take my cell number and promise to make her way back here in 6 months for the sole purpose of kicking my ass if i had not left by then.&nbsp; and for anyone whose seen her part in  urlLink 'Friday'  i don't think i want to test her on that!   so yesterday was my birthday.&nbsp; blah.&nbsp; today some of my friends are coming into town.&nbsp; we are going down to the casinos and then out on Beale.&nbsp; should be a grand time and i'm really looking forward to the hang out time with them.&nbsp; i don't get much of that anymore, and when you don't get it, you realize how much you missed it.&nbsp; also, i don't know how i feel about turning 26...it's one step closer to 30, not that i'm scared of 30 or anything like that.&nbsp; you gotta remember, i'm the guy who still gets asked if he's 18.&nbsp; hopefully things will stay&nbsp;that way.   lastly, per another's request, i set up a  urlLink site  at MySpace.com.&nbsp; not much there yet, but i dig the intro.&nbsp; i was feeling very creative at the time of inception, which lately my creativity has seemed vacant.&nbsp; i guess i need to eat more Fig Newtons...watch more&nbsp;'Cagney & Lacey' on Lifetime...something.&nbsp;    hoagies and grinders,    hoagies and grinders,    navy beans,    navy beans,    meatloaf sandwich...    i need the new Sandler  urlLink album .&nbsp; oh yes, i do.

        urlLink     day four on the  urlLink 'Hustle &amp; Flow'  set. working on this movie continues to be an amazing experience. everyone from the grips to the actors are all cool to be around and hang out with all day long. today we worked a 13 hour day! after talking with DJ this afternoon, i was advised that he will be around for the entire shoot til Aug. 6th...which means i will be around til then, which i don't mind at all. good times. also today, the director  urlLink Craig Brewer  (great guy, by the way) was discussing an idea he has about shooting a low budget film about the 2nd team (stand-ins) on this film. he expressed a lot of interest in shooting it on an off day soon, so we'll see. it would star all of us 2nd teamers, which will be very grand.  &nbsp;   check out the above pic from today's shoot.&nbsp; i took it on my cell phone, so the quality is lacking, but you can still make out the main actors.&nbsp; this is the tiny room that we have been working in for the last 4 days.&nbsp; it's amazing how many people can be crammed in one small space, just to make a movie.

      today i worked on the set of  urlLink 'Hustle &amp; Flow'  as a stand-in for  urlLink DJ Qualls  character. you would know him from  urlLink 'Road Trip'  and  urlLink 'The New Guy.'  the set is very small, and everyone is very laidback, which is cool.  urlLink Anthony Anderson  cuts up with us during breaks, and the guy is funnier off camera than he is on.  urlLink Terrance Howard  and  urlLink Taryn Manning  are also in the cast and  urlLink John Singleton  is producing. i got the call for this gig last night, and i'm very fortunate to have the opportunity. everything is day to day right now, but the rumour is that i'll be DJs stand-in for the whole shoot. but the more important rumour is that i may get an on screen role later on during production. this could be HUGE, man...freak'n  HHHHHUUUUGGGEEE  !   good times. more to come... urlLink

       urlLink    last night we went to the  urlLink casino , wherein i proceeded to donate $60 of my money to Mr. Jack Binion.  you have to understand that i have this method in that every time i go into the casino with only $60 on me, i always leave breaking even or ahead.  well, my luck has apparently changed.  we all lost our ass at the grand ole Horseshoe.  on another note, apparently they were celebrating  Prom  and  Pregnant  night at this particular casino.  i have never seen so many kids and pregnant ladies in that place.  i'm pretty sure i'll never know how it feels to be pregnant, but given the chance that ever happens, i'm pretty sure a casino will be the last place i want to hang out.  something about harboring a child and smelling like a dirty ashtray just doesn't mix.  the rent-a-cops at the door were obviously not checking IDs.  there were quite a few young'uns that were  maybe  pushing the ripe old age of 17.  and that's a big f'n  maybe .  today i decided to test out  urlLink Netflix .  a few friends have told me how cool it was in the past, but i never really looked into it.  my queue is loaded up with tons of indy films from the past 5 years or so that i've yet to sit down and watch.  also i have the  urlLink 'Band of Brothers'  miniseries coming.  i saw a few episodes recently on the History Channel, and got hooked in.  it's official -- i have to carry a larger  urlLink CD case  in my car from here on out.  i had been getting by with a 64 disc case, but it's just not cutting it these days.  in the past i use to roll around with a 128 disc case, and it appears as though those days have come again.  and the first CD to be added to the larger case... urlLink MC Hammer 'Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em'  ...like anything else could ever be more deserving.

      while flipping channels this afternoon, i ran across a film called  urlLink Tempted  on CinemaxWest.  it's some thriller set in New Orleans starring Burt Reynolds and Peter Facinelli.  according to IMDB, it was released in Europe, but not the US, so odds are you've never heard of it.  the interesting thing is that i met  urlLink Facinelli  on the streets of New Orleans while down for a  urlLink Unified Theory  show in November 2000.  he was obviously there filming this movie.  he's most popular as the jock in  urlLink Can't Hardly Wait .    anyway... small world

      we went to a screening of  urlLink 'Napoleon Dynamite'  last night, and i definitely encourage any and everyone to run out and see this movie.  this was easily one of the funniest movies i've seen in the last year.  the odd thing is that i knew going into the screening that i would probably like the movie.  that hasn't happened for me in over two years...not since  urlLink 'Rules of Attraction'  and  urlLink 'Punch-Drunk Love.'     anyway, i'm going to another flipp'n screening next week at the Paradiso.  Heck yes, i am!

      for whatever reason i've been thinking a lot about a road trip lately. i feel the need to go somewhere very random, that i've never been before, and somehow, someway take something educational out of the trip. the  urlLink Loretta Lynn dude ranch  is a very big possibility, only that it's not far enough away to be classified a road trip. i'm telling you, there's rules. on a more realistic note, Chicago is a very good destination. for one, i've never been there. for seconds, i have a friend there who has requested i come up for a visit. and for thirds, from all indications of everyone i've known to visit the windy city, it's a very very cool town with loads of interesting things to do.  the most crucial asset of my own road trips has got to be the soundtrack. good tunes and the open road go hand in hand for me... always have... always will. and with that notion, i have a certain criteria of CDs that always accompany my trip. because naturally a road trip without the right albums is like a popsicle without a stick. ok, nevermind, that would be an ice cream sandwich, but whatever, you get what i'm saying.  with this spirit of the journey, i felt it necessary to share my own personal road-trip-must-have-tunes-list. they're in no particular order...      Jeff Buckley - Grace  Beck - Mutations  Blind Melon - Soup  Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon  North Mississippi Allstars - Shake Hands With Shorty  The Strokes - Is This It  The Doors - Strange Days  Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream  Foo Fighters - Colour & the Shape  The Rolling Stones - Sticky Fingers  Kings of Leon - Youth &amp; Young Manhood  Dazed and Confused Official Soundtrack  The Beatles - Rubber Soul  Pearl Jam - Vs.  The White Stripes - De Stijl  Lynyrd Skynyrd - Pronounced  Radiohead - OK Computer  The Black Crowes - Amorica  The Verve - Urban Hymns  Led Zeppelin - IV (Zoso)      if i've left anything off, which its almost a certain that i have, please feel free to post it below in the comments section. this is in no way an all inclusive list. besides all that, forgetting is my favorite pastime.

      i've been in a real bland mood the last few days. basically there are some really important decisions that i've got to make in the next 6 to 12 months, and it's bogging me down. on top of that, my living situation isn't the best of things, so i have that to anchor my mood as well. for those of you who know me, you know all too well how i've made a habit of running from important decisions in my life. well, it's time to change those ways. if not, running in circles is all i'll ever do. and i'm not fond of being dizzy.  anyway, i decided it's time to add a little music to the page. call it some 'ease your mind' music that's here for you and me. Lord knows we all need some. click  urlLink here  to enjoy the tune.

      i feel like this blog has been my neglected step child over the last few days. there have been many times that i planned to post, but i never got around to doing it. it would be great if i could go on and on about what kept me from posting, but that's not the case.     today i got the new Strokes fan club dvd in the mail. it's pretty cool, showing a lot of footage of the band while on tour. i haven't finished it yet, but so far the best part has got to be when all the guys put on fake facial hair to go out in Europe. i've gotta do that sometime. just for one night it would be great to fashion a nice handle-bar mustache.     while in the mall this afternoon, i finally broke down and bought  urlLink Grand Theft Auto III . i play  urlLink GTA: Vice City  all the time, and had been meaning to pick this game up for years. well today was the day. this should tide me over til October when  urlLink GTA: San Andreas  is released. i don't play video games nearly as much as my high school/college years, but these games are highly addictive. i've wasted away many hours on Vice City, simply doing nothing. that's the joy of the games...you can actually attempt to complete tasks, or just drive around offing people. pure beauty indeed.  well, tommorrow morning i have to drive to Nashville for this audition. i'm still not sold on the fact they are looking for a 30 year old looking guy. my agent swears i can pass for it, which leads me to ask her if we've met. it's for a radio station out of Canada, and i'm not real sure what i will be doing.  i've spent way too much time on  urlLink myspace  lately. a friend introduced it to me, and it may lead to my downfall. if you've never checked it out, i encourage you to do so. while you are there, my profile can be found  urlLink here . but i warn you again, the site is addictive. if you go, wear the patch...or get some of that gum.
