      Hey everyone!  This past weekend, you had a Memorial Day BBQ to remember, not only those who died in the war, but the variety of road kill animals that made up your hot dogs!  In entertainment news, Billy Joel recently crashed his car... again.  Billy Joel has now decided to start writing books for kids.  Instead of titles like The Cat in the Hat, he will be writing The Car in the Living Room. ... In world news, President Bush fell off his bicycle near his ranch in Texas last week.  Lucky for him, he was wearing the helmet he usually uses when eating pretzels! Donald Rumsfeld visited the troops in Iraq a while back, upon arrival, he said "Please, no pictures." =P ... And finally, Calgary and Tampa Bay suit up for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs tonight at the Saddledome. Go Flames!  CK out!

      I was sitting at my computer a few nights ago, wondering what I should do to pass the time. I decided that since I hadn't checked for spyware for a few weeks, this might be a good time to do it. After scanning I found I had 93 separate pieces of spyware. I went completely computer security crazy, and was on a mission to clean up my computer and get it running back at full speed. I downloaded a neat program called HiJack This!, which scans your computer for all running processes and startup programs and lists them neatly. It makes it very easy to get rid of the junk you don't want on your computer, and it catches everything AdAware misses. You can download it  urlLink here . It's also a great site to visit if you have any spyware or virus problems. After reading a few different posts I was able to quickly determine what should and should not be on my computer. I strongly recommend it to anyone who thinks they're computer might be infested.   urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink

      Well it's been a few days since my last post, mainly because of the stack of work I have that is all due in the next week or so. Most intimidating stack of papers I've ever seen in my life. Anyways, enough about me.   urlLink Read this.   I wonder how long it will be before Dubya decides that Canada may be hiding Weapons of Mass Destruction in their igloos, and decides to send his troops in to "clean house". Election Day is November 2nd Americans. Make the right choice.   urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink

      Today I added the tag board. Have fun with that, and leave me a message if you stop by the site. Tomorrow morning I'm going to the cottage until Monday night, so I probably won't have a chance to update the site at all. I'm going to be adding some sort of music section next week to make the site a little bit more interesting. I have a lot of projects due in the next few weeks, but I'm sure that I'll find some time to get some work done on here.  Have a great holiday weekend.

      The new Ontario budget was announced today. We have to pay for OHIP now. Needless to say, it is one of the most disappointing things I ever heard. Free health care was what made living in Ontario such a good thing. Outrageous. Cigarettes are up $2.50 a carton. I can't disagree with that. Jack them up as high as you want, people are still going to pay it. The government could make a mint. The provincial debt is going to be paid off in just a few years if things keep going the way they are. I still cannot get over the whole paying for OHIP bit. This is truly a sad day in Ontario history.

      I'm really going to have to learn what I should and should not post in this blog. I realize that it will more than likely be close friends of mine that read any of the content here, if they care to take the 30 seconds it takes to come and read one post. It is because of this, that I was forced to reconsider my original post, which has been deleted. Don't expect to see things in here that will be too revealing to my actual life. I'm going to try and make some changes to the site over the next few days, however, it may take longer than I would like, as I'm still getting used to HTML and there are many things that I don't know how to do yet. I have a lot of ideas, and I'm catching on quickly, so hopefully it won't take me too long to start producing. I'm going to be gone for 5 days this weekend, starting Thursday. I'll try and update the site via my cell phone, which I believe is possible. But I suppose only time will tell.  On another note, today was a good day. To my complete surprise, my English mark raised 4%. Believe me when I say that was a shock. It won't likely last long.

      Back from an extended trip from outerspace, it's Chevy Kurt!  Bill Clinton released his tell-all book about his life this past week.  When asked why he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, he replied "just because I could."  Coincidentally, that's the same thing YOU say every time you bang a fat chick!  It's Official! Britney Spears is getting married again.  Upon hearing the news, many more of her no-name male friends are hoping they are next in line for their upcoming engagement with Spears after another 2 day marriage.  In movie news, Spiderman2 will be released soon.  Critics are hoping for more action, more drama, and more Mary Jane in wet t-shirts!  After years of waiting, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are now 18!  With the Olsens now of legal age, all the perverted, old men are thinking that the new Gerber baby-food infant is looking pretty hottt!  In UEFA Euro 2004 news, host Portugal beat England and Greece beat France... then the United States beat them all with a baseball bat and called them a bunch of soccer sissies!  In local news, a mentally disturbed Toronto man had several guns and ammunition on Wednesday and was preparing to go a on shooting spree in a neighbourhood.  Before he carried the spree out, a dog started to play with him and he decided not to kill everyone... only in Canada!  Until next time...  CK out.

      All those who witnessed the live performance of "Not Afraid" on last year's Juno Awards got a sneak preview to the upcoming Our Lady Peace album "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face," which has been rumored to be out in October.  A studio version of "Not Afraid" has just been released. All I have to say is "Amazing." It will send chills down your spine! Hopefully I will soon be able to get a mp3 available for download. Until then here is a link to the lyrics for  urlLink "Not Afraid" . Until Next Time, Good morning, good evening, and good night. signing off: Ghostmanon3rd

      The bags are packed, and I'm just about to leave for the airport to go to Europe for 12 days. I figured I would get one more post in before I left. Kurt will be running the place in my absence and Nathaniel will continue to post his music and movie reviews.  There is one thing, however, that will be in the back of my mind the entire trip. The one thing that will have Toronto buzzing for the next 10 days or so. Will Ed Belfour resign with the Maple Leafs? Lets just keep our fingers crossed. The draft is June 26th and 27th, and would like to wish all the teams luck. Except Ottawa and Philadelphia.  For those who can, please vote on June 28th. As I have said before, it's your chance to have your voice heard, so take advantage of the opportunity. Remember: you cannot complain about the way things are being run in Canada if you couldn't take the time to vote.  Lastly, Matthew Good's second solo album  White Light Rock and Roll Review  came out this past Tuesday, and I highly recommend it.  Bye for now.  Or should I say Au Revoir.

      Tomorrow is the final day of classes, and will close the high school chapter of my life. Some great memories. Maybe one day I'll post some. But to anyone who happens to stumble upon this site, or to any frequent visitors: thanks for taking the time to get to know me over the past four years. I really appreciate it.

      Live from under your bed... BOO!!  It's Chevy Kurt.  It was a crazy weekend around Whitby, particularly on Saturday night when Nate Dawg, Julie, and myself all got drunk while we were hanging with Brent and Justin.  A planned movie night turned into a trip to Tim Horton's and then a pool party at my house.  And Naveed stopped by for the fun as well!  In music news, the christian rock band, Creed, announced they have broken up.  Upon hearing of the breakup, religious leaders stated that this proves once and for all that there is a God!  It's official! Julia Roberts is pregnant with twins!  However, doctors say that it's abnormal to see fetuses so full of themselves at such an early age...  In world news, film maker Michael Moore apparently had footage of prisoner abuse in Iraq long before the reports surfaced in the news.  When asked why he didn't expose the evidence earlier, Moore replied, "Why would I give up my personal stash of a bunch of sweaty men piling up on top of eachother naked and having anal sex!?"  A new medical report has shown that some cholesterol lowering drugs may actually cut the risk of glaucoma, a leading cause in blindness.  The drugs were commonly used to lower cholesterol in the body.  So now fat asses everywhere can continue to stuff their greasy faces with fast food while also not worrying about going blind!  Until next time...  CK out.

      With the summer about to start there's only one way to kick it off... going to a concert! On Wednesday of last week Brent and I went to see our recently favoured band Straylight Run. The concert was headlined by Rooney, a band that looked as though they had come straight out of the late sixties.   First up was  urlLink Ozma , a band out of Los Angeles, California. This was their first show ever in Canada, and though I was not overly excited to see them, they put on a good energetic show, playing many songs such as  Battlescars .   The Second set was the band who I had come to see, Straylight Run from New York. This was also their first show in Canada. The front man of Straylight Run John Nolan and the bass player Shaun Cooper are probably familiar to those who are into the band Taking Back Sunday. In May of 2003 the two left TBS because of artistic differences. John & Shaun recruited Will Noon from the late Breaking Pangaea, and John's sister Michelle Nolan, who did some back up vocals and piano work on the album  Tell All Your Friends . SR started their set off with the song  The Tension and the Terror , which can be downloaded free from  urlLink www.straylightrun.com . They continued with several new songs such as  Dignity and Money  and  Holding On . Finally to end their set they played the ever popular song  Existentialism on Prom Night  with John on keyboard and Michelle on guitar.  The headliner  urlLink Rooney , well known from their guest appearance on the teen soap The OC, hit the stage with the roar and screams of uncountable adolescent girls. They played many popular songs such as  Blue Side ,  Stay Away , and  Popstars . Their encore consisted of the hit songs  I'm Shakin  and  Sorry Sorry .  overall the night was quite enjoyable, minus the fact of missing our train stop, and ending up in oshawa. Ozma & SR put on an amazing show. Rooney did the same however I was a little set aback by how full of himself the lead singer was. In the end I give this concert an 8 out of 10 rating. I readily encourage you all to check out these bands, you will be very impressed.   Until next time, Good morning, good evening, and good night, signing off:  Ghostmanon3rd .

      Hi there everyone. This is my first post on Brent's Blog and i will be concentrating the majority of my topics on Music and the Media. I'm overly tired with the amount of people who only pay attention to "radio played" songs and bands. It is my personal opinion that some of the best bands out there are not always found on the radio or television. It is my goal to try and show the readers that talent and skill can be found outside of the corporate world. Until next time, Ghostmanon3rd

      Ok, I realize it's been quite a while since my last post, and I apologize. I've had absolutely no time to post between ISU's, and Prom weekend. So much to say. I'll start with Prom weekend.  Quite simply, it was a blast. I got to talk to a lot of old friends that I don't see much of at school, and it was great to see everyone all dressed up. The day after prom, I drove up to Wasaga Beach with a few friends and spent the night. There was about 70 or 80 people from our high school in total. Party on. I found myself watching the hockey game at some guy's truck across the campground. He had brought a TV and hooked it up to his truck, so that we wouldn't miss a minute of NHL action. The whole weekend was one of the best of my life.  So now all of my ISU's are over, and I can actually settle down and start to think about my last summer with my friends. It's very upsetting, as I have known many of the people I go to school with for 13 years. THIRTEEN YEARS. And now I may never see them again. The more I think about it, the less I look forward to college. But at least I will leave high school with some amazing friends, wicked memories, and a diploma.  I'm leaving for Europe on June 20th, and I'll be gone for 12 days. Kurt will be maintaining the site in my absence, and I trust he'll do a good job. *ahem* Expect pictures and stories when I return.  On a more serious note, June 28th is election day. I encourage everyone who is able to vote to do so. By voting you are voicing your opinion, and choosing the way you want your country to be run. Remember: you can't complain about the way the government is doing things if you couldn't even be bothered to vote. So please, take the time to research the various parties, and make your vote count.  Until next time.

      Hey again.  June 6, 1944 - sixty years ago today - D-Day. Canadian, American, and British troops stormed the beaches of Normandy to begin the liberation of Europe and win the war.  Stop and take a moment to think of all the brave men and women that have allowed us to enjoy our lives in freedom.  It's been one hell of a Stanley Cup Final to date.  Martin St. Louis scored to force a Game 7 last night in double overtime to send the series back to Tampa for a winner-take-all final.  Will it be Jarome Iginla leading his so-called 'underdog' Flames to victory, or after 22 seasons, will Dave Andreychuk finally get to sip from Lord Stanley's Cup?  In entertainment news, OJ Simpson has expressed interest in hosting a reality show.  I think he should just SLASH... or cut... that idea.  Maybe he could call his show "You've been Juiced."  Ba-doom tssssh! ;-)  Some food for thought... in Iraq, citizens are paying a mere 5 cents per gallon for gasoline compared to over 2 dollars in America and close to 6 dollars in Britain.  The average vehicle costs about $1 to fuel whereas the Brits are paying upwards of $127.  For future reference, we should let the U.S. invade Canada so they can subsidize our gas prices too.  In the sporting world, Smarty Jones lost the Belmont Stakes thereby failing to win the Triple Crown. Smarty, now worthless and a 'one-trick pony,' will be shot and used as children's glue by next week.  And finally, former President Ronald Reagan lost his decade long battle to Alzheimer's on Saturday.  He will always be remembered as the man who won the Cold War.  Rest in Peace, Ronnie.  1911-2004.  Until next time...

      Back from the centre of the earth... it's Chevy Kurt!  Well, it was an awesome weekend up at Brent's trailer!&nbsp; The weather couldn't have been any better and it was nice to meet his grandparents and some family friends.&nbsp; Again, another&nbsp;big thanks from Nathaniel and I go to Brent and his parents for having us up there for the 3 days.&nbsp; All 3 of us are pretty sunburnt, especially Brent lol.&nbsp; Warm water, great food, YA YA!!&nbsp; Brent played his guitar and sang "Picture" by Cheryl Crow and Kid Rock&nbsp;with Nathaniel to a bunch of people in the rec hall, it was a great show.... "So luxurious!"   So, besides Nathaniel and I cranking the tunes in the car, the swimming, and all the good eating.. it couldn't possibly have been a better&nbsp;trip.  Until next time...

Oh no, you had to take full credit for this one and gloat about it for weeks and as a result, you are now banned from the living room.&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; It was worth it! &nbsp; Until next time... &nbsp; CK out!

      The new Taking Back Sunday album, "Where You Want To Be" is set to be released on July 27th 2004. Lucky for me I was able to get a pirated copy, before its release. (Don't worry I will be purchasing the Album the day it is on the shelf!) Since I've started listening to "Where You Want To Be" it has not left my CD player. Though it lacks the mind blowing poetry which John Nolan took with him when he left Taking Back Sunday, it still rings quality which&nbsp;I encourage you viewers to get your hands on.  &nbsp;  The eleven track album consists of many new songs, which include the upcoming single, "A Decade Under the Influence" and "This Photograph is Proof (I know You Know)," which can also be found on the Spiderman 2 Soundtrack.  &nbsp;  If you can't wait for the 27th, and you have no way of getting a pirated version of "Where You Want To Be" you can check out the entire CD on mtv.com. From July 20th-27th, mtv.com is hosting "The Leak," a free stream of the new album. Here's the links to the two mtv sites hosting the stream:  urlLink mtv2.com  &amp;  urlLink mtvu.com . You can also check out the new Taking Back Sunday video, "A Decade Under The Influence" at the TBS web page,  urlLink takingbacksunday.com .  &nbsp;  "Where You Want To Be" is almost here, and&nbsp;I strongly encourage you to go buy it. I give it a&nbsp;7.8/10.  Until Next Time, Good morning, good evening, and good night.  Signing off: Ghostmanon3rd  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      This is a little off topic from my usual, music and movies but I think that a few people out there will get a kick out it. For those who don't know Brent and I work at a little store known as Algoma Orchards. Our job entails putting up with the stupid, and incompetent shoppers, who delight each and every moment at work with their idiocy. Well its the summer, so now I have a little more time on my hands. Aside from music, I love to draw so I have decided to release some of our wonderful stresses onto paper, to share with the viewers. "Episode 1: Do You Sell Apples?" should be ready by the end of this week, and all those who are interested can come take a peek right here on this Blog.

      Well I can't regret,  can't you just forget it?  I started something I couldn't finish  And if we go down,  we go down together  best friends means,  well best friends means   And I've got a twenty-dollar bill  that says you're up late night starting  fist fights versus fences in your backyard  Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor  Soaking in sympathy  from friends who never loved you  nearly half as much as me    Chorus  Broken down in bars and bathrooms  All I did was what I had to  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's just what anyone would do  Take the time to talk about it  Think a lot and live without it  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's something unforgivable...ohoh   Well I can't regret,  can't you just forget it?  I started something I couldn't finish  And if we go down,  we go down together  best friends means,  well best friends means   You never knew  well i never told you...  Everything I know about breaking hearts  I learned from you, it's true  I've never done it with the style and grace you have  But I've made long term plans  based on these mistakes    Chorus   Is this what you call tact?  I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back  so let's end this call,  and end this conversation  there's nothing worse...  (that's right he said, that's right he said it)  I swear, you have no idea  The jealousy that became me thinking  (that's right he said)  that you always had it way too easy    Chorus   Best friends means I pulled the trigger  Best friends means you get what you deserve (x5)   Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!!!  Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!!!  Written by: John Nolan

      What if you woke up in the middle of the night  And in your bare feet you walked outside  And realizing that you were awake that you could fly  Out over the world  To places that you’ve only heard of  See faces that you were sold as murderers  But just like you they’re only lonely boys and girls  Like all over the world  What if you could lift them up?  What if you could make it so that times weren’t tough?  So every morning when the world woke up  There’d only be weather on the news  And what if you were back in bed  With one of them floating over your head  What do you say to your enemies  When you don’t know what it is that could have been between you?  There ain’t no blue skies over bad lands  Even if it ain’t raining in the mornings  But you don’t need to fly to understand it  Just understand understanding  Written by Matthew Good

      Yes, I realize that I've been home almost a week and still haven't posted yet. I also realize that I should have done so shortly after I got home. But it's late, and I'm tired and stressed. So I'm going to use this post just to rant. If you do not want to read my useless ramblings, stop reading now. I'll give you a second to think about that.        Good.   Ok. I worked today from 11-8. I hate that shift, because when everyone is leaving at 5, I can wave goodbye to them and say "See you later, I still have 3 more hours!". That's always great fun. So I get to work the same shift again tomorrow, and then twice next week. Fun. I had to deal with registering my schedule for next year at Durham College tonight. It was an unpleasant surprise when I realized there were no good schedules. Then because "somebody" wasn't responsible enough to be home when we had agreed to meet online, I missed out on the best of the bad schedules. Because I was nice enough to wait and watch as the "good" schedule filled up. This is probably going to sound lame, but I'm going to say it anyways. The Leafs organization is just pissing the hell out of me. The more I think about it, the angrier I get at Pat Quinn. The man is quite plainly still taking the position of General Manager, with JFJ simply signing the paperwork. As much respect as I have for the man, I think it's time for the Leafs to make a change. Tonight I was blessed from a friendly email from a close friend of mine. It basically outlined that I have been treating him like shit for our whole lives, and he's sick of it. Well there really isn't too much I can say about that is there? I suppose I could write up an 1800 word email and send it on over to him, but I'm not like that. So anyways, it's 1:13 AM, and I'm going to go to bed.  Until next time.

      Live like the worm in your apple pie, it's Chevy Kurt.  In religious news, a priest and a nun were caught doing the nasty in the backseat of a car inside an airport parking garage.... and the Catholic church couldn't be happier!  This is the best news the Catholic church has had in years!   In family news, your father decided it was time to teach you your nation's favourite past time, hockey.  Unfortunately for you, it wasn't that kind of hockey... it was tonsil hockey!  In world news, France has decided to ban junk food from school vending machines.  French politicians believe that it's the best way to make  healthier  cowards.... To continue on with the french bashing, a french climber known as "Spiderman" climbed a skyscraper in Jakarta this past week.  On-lookers said he would have reached the top sooner if he hadn't of retreated 10 feet for every 5 feet he moved forward.  In celebrity news, the man who will be playing the part of Michael "The Molestor" Jackson feels he may not be up to the role.  Not because he's 6'4", making him much taller than MJ, but because he's black!  News Flash!!  The creators of The Simpsons are saying that one of the long time Simpsons characters will be coming out of the closet.  It will most likely be Lisa Simpson because she resembles a fellow lesbian, the Statue of Liberty. That's right! The Statue of Liberty is a.... lessssbian..... a.... lessssbiaaaaaan....  It's official! Britney Spear's fiance is the father of another baby!!!  When asked if Britney was ready for kids, she said no, not because she is not a girl, not yet a woman, but because Britney is still... a whore.... a little whorrrrrrre...  Until next time...  CK out.

      Thought I would drop in and post something, since I have been gone for over a week, and am going back to my cottage tomorrow. That's right, home for only one day. Let me explain. My dad chipped his tooth earlier in the week and had to go to the dentist in Pembroke, which is the closest to civilization to our cottage. The dentist put a temporary dealy on his tooth, and arranged an appointment with our family dentist for the next day. So my dad comes back up the day following his appointment, and tells me that there is a message on the answering machine from a local video store(where I had applied to just prior to leaving for the cottage) saying that if I was still interested in a job, to call by Friday. It was Friday. I immediately headed over to the phone and called the video store to let them know I was still interested, and to set up an interview. The following is a short transcript of that phone call, as best as I can remember it.  ... Brent: I'm still interested in the job, and would like to arrange an interview. I'm at my cottage, and I'm 4 hours away, but I'll be home on Saturday or Sunday of next week. Video Store Employee: Oh, the weekend.... I was hoping to have all of my interviews wrapped up by Tuesday or Wednesday, so that I could make my decision by Friday, and start training people the following week. Brent:.... ok, well I suppose I could drive home? Video Store Employee: That would be great, I have Tuesday or Wednesday. Brent: Tuesday. Video Store Employee: 2:30 or 3? Brent: 2:30 sounds good. Video Store Employee: Great, see you then. *click*  So that's it. One day and a 4 hour drive home later, I find myself at 1:32 AM posting on my blog. My interview is tomorrow at 2:30 PM, after which I will drive 4 hours back to the cottage. All this driving for a job interview.  I better get this job.  I'll be home on Saturday or Sunday.  Until next time.
