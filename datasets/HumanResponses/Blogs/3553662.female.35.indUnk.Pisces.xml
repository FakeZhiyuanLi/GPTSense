      I can't actually watch Wimbledon while at work, but I can sort of watch it  urlLink here .  I still predict Henman and Federer in the men's finals. The ladies' finals will be...um...S. Williams and Davenport? Perhaps?  **Ed. note Well I am not so sure about Henman now. He just lost two sets to  urlLink M. Ancic .  ***Additional ed. note Well Henman just lost. I'll be. So much for me and my predictions. I think it'd be great to see Federer and Ancic in the finals. The #1 against an unranked. But the semis are still to come and I, obviously, suck at predictions.

      From today's NY Times...  "The Court v. Bush  'A state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens.' With those words, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor confronted the claim of President Bush that the "war on terror" entitles him to act without any meaningful check by the courts. She and seven of her colleagues on the Supreme Court firmly rejected his presumption of omnipotence.  ... urlLink we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad."

      From  urlLink Salon.com ...  The following is an excerpt from a speech given by former Vice President Al Gore to the American Constitution Society at Georgetown University on June 24. Click on the above link for the full speech.  "When we Americans first began, our biggest danger was clearly in view: we knew from the bitter experience with King George III that the most serious threat to democracy is usually the accumulation of too much power in the hands of an executive, whether he be a king or a president. Our ingrained American distrust of concentrated power has very little to do with the character or persona of the individual who wields that power. It is the power itself that must be constrained, checked, dispersed and carefully balanced, in order to ensure the survival of freedom. In addition, our founders taught us that public fear is the most dangerous enemy of democracy because under the right circumstances it can trigger the temptation of those who govern themselves to surrender that power to someone who promises strength and offers safety, security and freedom from fear.   It is an extraordinary blessing to live in a nation so carefully designed to protect individual liberty and safeguard self-governance and free communication. But if George Washington could see the current state of his generation's handiwork and assess the quality of our generation's stewardship at the beginning of this 21st century, what do you suppose he would think about the proposition that our current president claims the unilateral right to arrest and imprison American citizens indefinitely without giving them the right to see a lawyer or inform their families of their whereabouts, and without the necessity of even charging them with any crime. All that is necessary, according to our new president is that he -- the president -- label any citizen an "unlawful enemy combatant," and that will be sufficient to justify taking away that citizen's liberty -- even for the rest of his life, if the president so chooses. And there is no appeal.     What would Thomas Jefferson think of the curious and discredited argument from our Justice Department that the president may authorize what plainly amounts to the torture of prisoners -- and that any law or treaty which attempts to constrain his treatment of prisoners in time of war is itself a violation of the constitution our founders put together.   What would Benjamin Franklin think of President Bush's assertion that he has the inherent power -- even without a declaration of war by the Congress -- to launch an invasion of any nation on Earth, at any time he chooses, for any reason he wishes, even if that nation poses no imminent threat to the United States.   How long would it take James Madison to dispose of our current president's recent claim, in Department of Justice legal opinions, that he is no longer subject to the rule of law so long as he is acting in his role as commander in chief.   I think it is safe to say that our founders would be genuinely concerned about these recent developments in American democracy and that they would feel that we are now facing a clear and present danger that has the potential to threaten the future of the American experiment.   Shouldn't we be equally concerned? And shouldn't we ask ourselves how we have come to this point?"

      So I'm being a good citizen. I'm on my way to work, riding my bike, showing up on time, not selling drugs or beating up old people. What am I greeted by when I make the turn for my building? Some piece of shit street trash peeing on the builing across from mine. The guy is about three yards from me, putting away his shlong, his urine cascading down the sidewalk.  Maybe he's homeless and has nowhere else to pee. Maybe he's drunk at 8:30 in the morning. Maybe it gets him off to pee outside. Whatever. Fucking ewww. It grossed me out. And it kind of made me jealous. Yes yes yes. Guys can pee standing up. Yay for you all. Must you flaunt your good anatomical fortune?  And since penises make me think of guitars (heh)...  urlLink Clapton's guitar, "Blackie", goes for $959,500 at auction . The auction raised over $7M for Crossroads Centre Antigua--a rehab Clapton is involved with in the West Indies.  Wow. That's some fine memorabilia collecting, right there. Way to go. I like collecting stuff, too, but the chances of me ever being in a financial position that allows me to drop close to a million bucks for, well, anything are slim to none.  I collect bells. Have been for 25 years (picture me at 65--crazy bell lady). I used to collect REM bootlegs, but got over that. I have a "thing" for fleur-de-lis designs and I have them in various places in my home and on my body. And just yesterday, I went on a search for the fabled Roger Federer coffee creamers they were hawking in Switzerland a while back. I really want to have some of those. That has to be one of the more random promotional ideas I've heard.  Another random promo item is the Carolina Hurricanes sunscreen lotion I saw on the team's website. Ice hockey teams and sunscreen. Intentionally ironic or just a dumb idea? Who can say? Of course, it was not a big seller so they had it on clearance, so I got a bottle. It's odd. It's so very odd.  Today's online quest = searching for really great, random promo items. Got any you want to point out? Well please and thank you! My email address is linked to my name at the end of the post.

      Well the sculpture I mentioned in my last post is finally in my possession. If I had a functioning digital camera, I'd take a picture of it for you. It is a large, winged pig with a dramatic purple sash, mounted on an ornate board with floral, uh, thingys in the corners. It really is quite something. I need to name it. It needs to be either the Celestial Swine of Middle Carrboro or Laird, which is the artist's name. He was kind of a pig about getting the thing to me (albeit an accidental pig--he's a slack artist, not an intentional jerk--yeah, i've calmed down a bit since that last post), so I think it's fitting.  It is woefully heavy and requires about seven large bolts for wall mounting. So I'm gonna do something leany with it instead. I do rent, after all.  Now. I am at work. And I have finished my assigned task. The feller who could give me more tasks is not around. So I'm getting paid to sit here and do this. I wouldn't kick  "this" out of bed for eating crackers.  :|

      So over two months ago, I gave a very talented local artist $400 for a sculpture. He told me it would be done in "a week and a half at the most."  Silly me. I believed him.  I gave him some good-natured ribbing whenever I saw him and got responses along the line of 'yeah--it'll be done soon--i'm sorry.' After about 7 weeks had passed, I got mad and asked for my money back. He freaked and said he'd already spent it and to give him a few more days. I agreed. That was two weeks ago.  He has promised phone calls and/or delivery of the sculpture several times. I have bitched at him several times for not keeping his promises.  I don't want to cause a talented artist bodily harm, but I have no problem berating him. Often. Passionately. Publicly.   And it really sucks because I don't even want the damn sculpture now. He has killed my enthusiasm by lying to me, blowing off my pre-paid sculpture, and by taking so damn long.  I'll take the sculpture IF he ever gets it to me, but it's going to live in a closet for a while. Until I get over being mad at the situation.  It's just going to have to be grudge art for a while.

      Last night I dreamed I was driving, but I wasn't in the car. I was a few yards behind the car. I didn't have a steering wheel in my hands, but I had a brake and gas pedal. There was a lot of traffic and I was trying to catch up to my car so I could get back in it. But the car veered off the road, hit another car, and then veered off the other way and landed in a junk yard.   Martha Stewart was working at the junk yard and she said she'd take my car and sell me another one she had on the lot. Martha had a booger hanging out of her nose and I discreetly let her know. She didn't thank me.   The&nbsp;car Martha wanted to sell me&nbsp;had some really awful personalized plate on it and I asked her if I could put my own tags on this other car. She said yes. We worked out some sort of payment plan. And then I woke up.   I never found out if Martha sold me a lemon. I bet she did.

      I have a love/hate relationship with my feet. On one hand, (no pun intended) I enjoy walking around on them and I have done so from a very early age. I started walking when I was six months old, much to the joy of my parents. I'm also lucky to have generally attractive feet. No freaky long middle toe or anything.  But my feet are often highly uncooperative. My feet are wide and I walk funny. Can't help it, really. And my feet usually hurt terribly, probably because of the way I walk. All signs of the zodiac have a body part that is associated with them for better or for worse. I am a Pisces and Pisces have feet issues. Therefore, shoes are a pretty constant issue as well (constant fucking issue). Yeah we all deal with our feet, but some of us moreso than others. If I never had to deal with my feet, I'd be a very happy person. That ain't gonna happen.  For your reading pleasure (??), here is a short list of shoe styles I will never wear. Some I just can't wear and some I refuse to wear on the grounds that they are so ugly they make my feet hurt more than they do every day already.   urlLink The Kittten Heel   and  urlLink Stilettoes  --I will never wear these styles. Not because I don't want to. One is cute and one is sexy. I just can't walk in them. I have wide feet, I walk like a duck, and I supinate (walk on the outsides of my feet) something fierce.  These things combined make high, narrow heels a little slice of torture for me, not to mention an accident waiting to happen. Alas.   urlLink Lotus Shoes  --I will never wear lotus shoes because I didn't have my  urlLink feet bound  as a child.   urlLink Birkenstocks  --Other than the polyurethane kitchen/gardening shoes they make, I find Birkenstocks to be so ugly I just can't bring myself to wear them. Everyone says they are tremendously comfortable and while I am all about foot comfort, I do have to draw the line somewhere.  Ditto for  urlLink Tevas .   urlLink Ankle straps --Because they make me huge calves look even bigger.   urlLink Jellies --I knew they were an unattractive and blister-inducing idea when they came out. Wouldn't wear them then. Not gonna wear them now. The  urlLink kitten heel jelly  , the  urlLink ankle strap jelly , and the  urlLink jelly that looks like a Teva  get double negative points.   urlLink Maxi-pad slippers --You can't make up this stuff.   urlLink Horseshoes --I am not a horse. And even though I like getting tattoos and piercings, I don't think I'd enjoy nailing anything to myself.    urlLink Brake shoes --I am not a set of drum brakes.

      I adore the VH1 "I Love The 70s/80s/90s" shows. That could mean I'm getting old or it could mean I am easily entertained or it could mean nothing or it could mean it's just a good show. Choose the meaning that fulfills you. Anyway, at this moment, "I Love 1981" is on and WUHhoah the memories. Journey, Smurfs, Friday The 13th. I was 12 in 1981. Being 12 sucked butt, but the pop culture memories make it all seem so rosey now.   So of course I go to the VH1 website, because I am a little out of control, and I see  urlLink this story about Courtney Love . Oh Courtney. You&nbsp;bad, bad girl. Too many/much drugs&nbsp;(which may be the reason for the bad&nbsp;plastic surgery decisions).&nbsp; I predict you will be hanging out with Kurt Cobain and GG Allin soon.   Speaking of VH1, I recently saw  urlLink this guy  on some of their assorted 'best of' type shows. That's Brian Huskey! He used to be in a band called  urlLink Bicycle Face!  They were really good! One of the best live shows ever to be seen.&nbsp;Unfortunately, they signed with Moist Records/Baited Breath Productions which, it turns out, was owned by&nbsp;a couple of guys who loved music but didn't know, or learn, squat about business&nbsp;and the whole undertaking failed miserably (I spent a little less than a year working as their radio rep. I so cleverly dubbed myself Moist/Baited Beth. Ha ha?)&nbsp;But Bicycle Face did get to release a good album. It got little if any promotion from the label (not my fault--I was just an underpaid employee), but it stands as a&nbsp;really good&nbsp;album, nonetheless. As does  urlLink Beyond The Java Sea &nbsp;by Metal Flake Mother. And Too Much Pork For Just One Fork by  urlLink Southern Culture on the Skids . If you can find a copy of any music the label released, get it. They were awful businessmen, but the few releases that actually hit stores were good.   For the record, I will never work in the music industry again. I hated it. And I was a damn good radio rep, too.&nbsp;But never again will I tread those waters. It took all the fun out of music for me. Fuck that noise.

       I don't like a lot of people today.  Last night, two people told me, unsolicited, that they don't like my new haircut. They said they don't like the cut or the way I style it and that I should have left it long. I didn't ask--they just said it.&nbsp;I am a grown-up and I know that hair does not make a person, certainly. But it still&nbsp;hurt my feelings and left me feeling ugly and stupid and mad at them. I've received compliments about my hair recently, but the criticisms tend to just run all over them, unfortunately.  Just yesterday, I posted a big ole critical rant, unsolicited,&nbsp;about people I don't even know. Does this make me a hypocrite? Chances are huge that the people I ranted about&nbsp;will never read this blog and will never be exposed to my unsolicited opinions about them. I was insulted straight to my face last night. There's a difference, but I'm not sure that makes me any less of a hypocrite.  I suck so bad sometimes.   But not as bad as AT&T or Bank of America. They are drowning in their own suckage.&nbsp; I want to use smoke signals for communication and keep my money in a cookie jar from now on. I just got off the phone with these wugga companies, straightening out a&nbsp;problem that I didn't even create. I am, apparently, quite naive for thinking that Bank of America's online bill payment service is speedy and reliable.  It would rock if some unexpected good thing would happen to me&nbsp;today. I fucking need it.

      First, I am no fan of Jessica Simpson. I have nothing against her really, but I loathe that style of music. I also think&nbsp;the whole "Newlyweds" reality show is just&nbsp;pathetic. Don't you want to keep some of that stuff private? For yourself? Not on TV, where people watch and then think they know you?&nbsp;Whatever it takes to make the big money, I guess. &nbsp; Now, Jessica's little sister,  urlLink Ashlee , is being a big fat copycat. She has an album out--full of pre-fab, image-driven garbage--she's doing commercials with her sister, and she has a reality TV show. Man. Ride that bandwagon, Ashlee. Forget originality. Forget independence. Forget integrity. Just do exactly what your big sister did, get your 15 minutes, make a lot of money, be the butt of a lot of jokes, and stand proud. &nbsp; And yes. I know. It's easy for me to criticize from a distance. But I do know for certain that, were I in Ashlee's shoes, I would NOT do what she's doing. I'm embarrassed for her. &nbsp; Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavigne, and others who have a 'rocker' image, yet make really fluffy pop music make me want to throw up all over their pre-ripped jeans and designer 'thrift store' wear. Kelly Osbourne, at least, got close to getting it right.

      I just subscribed to a fitness newsletter (can't hurt) and they sent a confirmation email with some introductory info and links. One of the links goes to a downloadable book called "Do It With Your Dog."   *blink*  Yes they are talking about things like going for a walk in the park with your dog, not "doing it" with your dog. And based on some of the other content I see from these folks, I think the pun was intentional. They refer to sciatica as "a pain in the ass"--which it is, both literally and figuratively. Perhaps this is the perfect source of fitness information for me, purely because it has a raunchy edge to it.  Speaking of doing it... If you are a sexually active, heterosexual guy,  urlLink read this . These bits of information may not apply to all women, but they damn sure apply to me.   Wow. That sounded like some sort of booty call. Not my intention, but if it gets me some action, well okay then.  And because it seems like nary a post can go by without a mention of  urlLink Dave , I give you a link to a really funny story Dave told me about a few days ago.   urlLink Stoned Delaware Student Gets Lost in Connecticut   "'I think I stole a car,' Cunningham told a dispatcher. 'I'm not sure.'   Police said Cunningham, of Dover, Del., confessed that eating an entire bag of mushrooms, "probably wasn't a good idea." He allegedly told investigators that he had no idea how many laws he broke during a three-day excursion that took him 300 miles from home."  Wow.

      Oh glory be, I got REM sleep last night. I actually dreamed! I woke up once or twice during the night, I think, but I know for a fact that I slept at least four hours straight and that I dreamed during that period. I slept more after that as well.  Holy cow I feel like a new person. Stress sucks balls, primarily because it interferes with sleep.   I could cry, I'm so relieved. I can focus. I can concentrate. I don't ache all over. I tried taking benadryl the other night and that didn't help. Last night, I drank a few mugs of chamomille tea. That, on top of the fact that I was deliriously tired, actually helped me start catching up on sleep. I know I need another full night of hard sleep with no waking up, so maybe I'll tack on the melatonin tonight, like   urlLink Dave  suggested.  Speaking of Dave...big, huge best of luck to you and your fellow Linuxheads with  urlLink Specifix Linux .  Now, in other news...  I have little sympathy for  urlLink this man .  "LOXAHATCHEE, Florida (CNN) -- A 600-pound tiger owned by an actor who once portrayed Tarzan was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon, a wildlife official said."  The owner of the tiger says the tiger was sleeping and the officers shot him without cause. "Asked why officers took lethal force, he told CNN, "They want glory. They want to be able to say, *We killed the tiger. We are the winners. We did our job. We saved the people from this vicious tiger*." The officer says the animal lunged at him.   Just two years ago, this same tiger injured a woman who was working for the tiger's owner. "She was on the ground and looked like something unusual. All he did was grab her. It does not take very much for the fangs to penetrate human skin."  She was just lying on the ground, huh? Doesn't take much for the fangs to penetrate skin, huh? Sounds like a dangerous animal. The officials acted in the public's best interest, I'd say. I'm sorry the tiger is dead--they are beautiful animals--and I'm sorry for the man's loss, but he obviously wasn't being a very good wild animal owner to begin with if he allowed the beast to get loose. I say he learned a tough but reasonable lesson. Tigers are not domestic beasts. Never were meant to be. Never will be. You can't treat an escaped tiger like you'd treat a tabby cat stuck in a tree.  If anything, I think the owner should be charged for neglecting his animal (the owner's negligence ultimately resulted in the animal's death), as well as endangering the public.

      Delirium continues. Last night, I took some benadryl and got in bed at 8:30. Yes, 8:30. Dozed off around 9. I woke up so many times during the night. Doubt I got three consecutive hours at any point. Restless, couldn't get comfortable, mind rambling on and on. And I'm as bad off today as I was yesterday, if not moreso.  I gotta have a cup of coffee to see if that will do anything at all towards actually getting any work done today. Actually, it'll be amazing if I stay at work all day. I can picture someone coming up to me, taking me by the hand, putting my backpack on me, and sending me home with a pat on the head.  I just caught myself slumping in my chair, staring at the monitor with not one single thought in my head, hands poised freeze-frame over the keyboard. My top lip feels slightly numb. I can feel my hair. Reading is now becoming difficult.   gghh..

But I know there is no way I'll be able to make it tonight. It's only about 1:30 and I am seriously struggling to stay awake. Caffeine ain't gonna do the trick, either. I haven't had a really good night's sleep in close to two weeks and I am so delirious right now I'm having trouble walking. I'm not kidding. Walking is a significant challenge. And I keep finding myself with my head lolled to one side and my mouth hanging open.  I'm going to stop for sleep drugs on the way home and get in bed immediately. And wait for the next offering of the photography class. Damn it.

"There's no such thing as completeness," says Winter, who double-majored in philosophy and computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. "There's no way to be finished unless Starbucks goes out of business or changes its name. Those are two scenarios under which I would essentially be done, but there's really no such thing. The best I can hope for is to keep up. I can't foresee myself stopping." Winter stares into the bright Phoenix sun. "It's too rewarding an experience." "  Rewarding? Visiting every Starbucks in America and calling it a philosophical experience? Well I think that's phenomenally retarded. How about reading a million books? Or spending all that time volunteering? Or something, anything other than pandering to one of the biggest things that is wrong with America--the wugga corporation--and something that isn't so blatantly pathetic. He doesn't even take pleasure in getting to know anyone in the stores. He just gets in, drinks some coffee, and gets out as fast as he can. What an empty task he has chosen. Wow. Wow.

Seven years later, the Beatles -- as John and Paul's group became known -- famously "invaded" America and took the musical world by storm. By the time the band broke up in 1970, it had broken numerous sales records and transformed the face of popular music."  Wow. That's a meeting that has ended up affecting my life in a very constant way since I was a little kid.

      Well I watched my boyfriend Roger Federer win the Wimbledon Men's Singles Finals for the second year in a row yesterday (swoon!) and then went to a party at  urlLink Komejo's  house. Most of my favorite faces in the whole wide world were there. Much food, beer, fireworks, and poker ensued.   In my inebriated state, I did forget that people with a ruptured disc shouldn't do things like run or stand up for the better part of an evening rather than grab a chair, so I'm paying for that today, but I'll get over it.  Our wonderful host is an organized man, to put it mildly. So Andrew, Catlyn, and I decided to go mess with things in his highly organized bedroom. Turn a few books upside down--slightly shift some of the clothes in his closet--turn objets askew. Joe noticed most, if not all, of them within a matter of seconds. Amazing.  Joe provided us with a grand fireworks display. A few of us ran Sparkler Laps around the yard during this show and I don't think anyone stepped in anything gross or crushed any frogs.  Then the poker games started and I now realize that some of my friends aren't as smart as I thought they were (just joshing, Sandra and Beth P.!)  I became impromptu bartender and began making up shots. For the record, orange rum and maraschino cherry juice is a vile combination. A few of us brave/retarded souls were totally up for copious shot drinking. The quality of the shots was questionable, but the volume and frequency was something to behold. I don't have a hangover today, but I feel completely walleyed. I really don't understand why nobody threw up.    Here's to nobody throwing up!

      So I am watching the Wimbledon men's finals. And yes, I want Federer to win. Regardless, the commentators--John McEnroe especially--are being terribly biased towards Roddick. Root for the player you want, but when it comes to doing your job of being a commentator, a little neutrality is the way to go. I hope the producers point this out to them and tell them to be more professional from here on out. And I can't even switch over and watch it on ESPN--it's NBC or nothing.  Oh that was classy--Roddick just farted and waved it away with his racket. Nice.

       urlLink Bush To "SPAM" Church-goers?"   "In a move sharply criticized both by religious leaders and civil libertarians, the Bush-Cheney campaign has issued a guide listing about two-dozen "duties" and a series of deadlines for organizing support among conservative church congregations.  A copy of the guide obtained by Reuters directs religious volunteers to send church directories to state campaign committees, identify new churches that can be organized by the Bush campaign and talk to clergy members about holding voter registration drives.  The document, distributed to campaign coordinators across the country earlier this year, also recommends that volunteers distribute voter guides in church and use Sunday service programs for get-out-the-vote drives."  The list of reasons not to vote for this man never stops growing.

      Federer and Grosjean are playing their Wimbledon Men's Singles Semifinals match this morning. I'm going in to work late.  I know what's really important.  I will, once again, employ  urlLink this  later today. Gotta see what happens between Roddick and Ancic.  I cut my hair last night. I always do that. And I always remember, after it's too late, that I should never cut my hair. I need more hobbies and less access to mirrors and scissors. Or at least the willingness to pay some ridiculous amount of money to have a professional cut my hair once in a while.  I talked with a buddy/hair professional the other day and she recommends a haircut every three months. I haven't paid anyone to cut my hair in over, hmm, six years (probably a lot longer than that), so the chances of me going more than once in any 365-day period are pretty much non-existent.  I'm not terribly girly, I suppose. Hair, makeup, fashion--I try, but I'm just not very good at these things and I don't have the interest to invest the time, not to mention the money, these things often demand. But I love to paint my toenails and collect miniature thingys--that's pretty girly, isn't it?

      Glasgow, Scotland's  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  and Issaquah, Washington's  urlLink Modest Mouse  each have a single out now, with an accompanying video. Did they get together when they were writing these songs and planning the videos or is it just a freakish coincidence how similar they are? Not to take away from either band, they are both fantastic songs, but still.  And oh my stars there is more than one good reason to get up before 7am. VH1 and MTV actually show videos at this hour. And here is a brand new video from The Cure. I don't like to watch videos for songs I haven't heard yet, so I am averting my eyes. And, uh, I gotta say--the song is fairly forgettable. Damn. Robert? What happened to ye?  Random criticism. Hoobastank is one of the stupidest band names ever. And emo sucks.

      The main big thing I don't like about the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is Smeagel/Gollum. He's way too much like Jar Jar Binks. And Jar Jar was so unwanted. I wanted Jar Jar to die within, oh,  milliseconds of seeing him on screen. I'm almost that way about Gollum.  Like anyone asked...

      Next weekend, it's the infamous  urlLink Sleazefest  here in the Chapel Hill/Carrboro area. Bands at Local 506, The Sports Bar, and The Cave--all within walking distance of each other. It's a good time to listen to some sleazy rock music and hang out with some sleazy characters. Maybe  urlLink Mike Wallace  will be there. He's a rowdy old guy.   urlLink This  is a little on the rowdy side, too. Way to market, Hershey's.  You know what's not rowdy? My back. Well, wait. One might consider my back and it's ruptured disk to be rowdy because it's always acting up, but it makes me hobble along like a troll--which isn't rowdy.   Not Hot Fun in the Summertime, Just More Beth Complaints   Quick recap for the uninitiated (which can only apply to a few people, I bitch about this so much). I ruptured a disk four years ago. Ruptured it good. Had surgery. That sucked donkey. I ruptured it again a little over two years ago. No surgery this time because the rupture wasn't as bad and I don't have insurance. I just get to deal with it and try crap like physical therapy which has its limits and which I'm not diligent about anyway--I know, I know. If I were diligent about it the problem might go away. But I still need professional assistance here and I can't afford it on the ongoing basis the situation merits. And lovely old Blue Cross/Blue Shield said they'd insure me for a mere $1400 a month, thanks to pre-existing conditions--and they still wouldn't cover anything involving my back for a year.  *blink* If I could afford $1400 a month I could afford to pay my own doctor bills.  So anyway, my back is like a senile old person. Has its good days and its bad days. Yesterday was exceptionally bad. I chalk it up to my back being spunky and out for a little mean-spirited fun at my expense rather than the fact that I overdid it at the gym yesterday and failed to stop what I was doing when I felt a wrong pain rather than a right pain.  This lead to me needing a cane to get up from the couch last night. And having breathtakingly painful spasms when I coughed. Handfuls of aspirin and too much booze are the only things that make it stop hurting. Not good, but fun.  Now, my knees are going (no BJ jokes please) and my stupid ankles seem to be rolling out more and more, making me walk even more on the sides of my feet, which is pretty uncomfortable/sometimes painful. I've always walked weird--I remember it from childhood--my stupid brother used to tease me about it. But it's getting worse and worse and causing more and more trouble as I get older. I know all the back/foot/knee stuff is connected. Must speak with a trainer at the gym today.  I will, no doubt, be crippled one day. How sexy am I?  Time to go Googling for advice/exercises.

      So  urlLink Koko the gorilla is capable of making it known that she is in need of dental assistance . Well I just think that's neato. I also love this...  "Her teacher, Francine Patterson, was at her side when the anesthesiologist prepared to put her under in the morning, and apparently Koko asked to meet her specialists.  They crowded around her, and Koko, who plays favorites, asked one woman wearing red to come closer. The woman handed her a business card, which Koko promptly ate."  Note the photo in the link above of Koko holding a cat. I wonder if Koko promptly ate the cat after the picture was taken. Speaking of our next of kin and kittens...   urlLink A monkey scrubbin' a cat.   A little surreality goes a long way.

       urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/05/bush.ap/index.html   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush offered up a new entry for his catalog of "Bushisms" on Thursday, declaring that his administration will "never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people."  Bush misspoke as he delivered a speech at the signing ceremony for a $417 billion defense spending bill.  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."  Ohhhhhh the irony.

      I'm getting me one of these!  urlLink Toddy Maker for Cold Brew Coffee . I might get a  urlLink Senseo  coffee maker, too. This will give me four ways to brew coffee. Surely, four ways of brewing is the bare minimum with which a person can be expected to meet all their coffee needs.  If any of you have experience with either of the above brew methods, chime in. I'd love to hear. Especially about the Senseo machine.  More coffee stuff:  urlLink Too Much Coffee Man   urlLink I Need Coffee   urlLink Why Coffee is Better Than a Woman --if you're dating a guy who thinks like this often and seriously, dump him. But not until you drink all of the coffee in his house.

      So a few days ago, I decided to try the Lord of the Rings movies again. I must say I'm enjoying this foray. And it truly is a foray because sci-fi/fantasy is normally not something I enjoy in the least. In this case, I am enjoying myself a good bit. I have watched the first two movies and have the third one on deck.  Now, I am trying to figure out what kind of creature I'd be (I am really dorking out on this--go ahead--laugh at me.)  I am not big, strong, and bent on destruction (contrary to popular opinion) like the orcs. I am not long, lean, and wise like the elves. I am not warty and gross like the dwarves. I am not as swarthy as any of the humans in middle earth. So I suppose I'm a hobbit. I have the feet and the hair for it, that's for sure. And I run in to things a lot. The hobbits seem to collide with stuff and fall down a lot in these movies. I can relate to that. So I'm a hobbit.  And now, I am going to laugh at myself for a few minutes.

      I have been known to date guys who are younger than I am. In one case, he turned out to be even younger than I thought, much to my chagrin. I don't seek out younger guys, I just end up with them. Perhaps it's because of my youthful ways and looks! (everyone nods.)  I have never, nor will I ever, take it as far as  urlLink Mary Kay Letourneau  took it. To each his/her own, but, fucking ewwww. The boy's playing field probably didn't even have any grass on it when they met.

      My lovely weekend was just made even better because I got to watch the tail end of the Tennis Masters Cananda finals between Andy Roddick and  urlLink Roger Federer . Federer won 7-5, 6-3. Roddick has beaten Federer once. Once.  Andy Roddick just said he doesn't see how Roger can improve much. He is that good. Federer's style is so fluid and so graceful and so perfect. His decisions and his placement are perfect. And, my stars, they are interviewing him now and he has his hair down and he is just a breathtakingly good looking man. He could look like Ivan Lendl and I'd still be a fan, but the fact that he is a babe is a bonus.  I watched a few other things this weekend. Some good, some bad--none as good as that five minutes of tennis I just watched.  I rented  urlLink Daydream Obsession , thinking it would be a good erotic thriller. No. It was just  urlLink crap . I watched  urlLink Gothika . Also  urlLink crap . I watched  urlLink Live Forever . Fucking awesome. I could listen to Noel and Liam Gallagher and Damon Albarn prattle on for hours and hours. If they did this prattling in the same room, there would be bloodshed. The Gallagher brothers would beat up Damon and then they'd probably beat up each other.  And I have finally rented the first Lord of the Rings movie. I tried to watch it once before and fell asleep. Twice. But I saw some of the second one last night and kind of liked it. So now I'm gonna try once more to understand this juggernaut. I know so many people who love these books and movies. And these are people I like and think are cool and whose opinions I respect. I'm just not "getting" it yet. Maybe I will this time. If not, fuck it and on to other things.  Why, one might ask, have I spent so much of the day inside watching movies and tennis? Because it's August in NC. It's 400 degrees outside with 600% humidity. Completely, utterly disgustingly uncomfortable. Fuck that noise.
