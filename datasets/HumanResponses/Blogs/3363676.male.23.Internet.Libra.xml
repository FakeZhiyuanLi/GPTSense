         11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, &quot;Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?&quot;     12 When Jesus heard that, He said to them, &quot;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.  13 But go and learn what this means: &quot;I desire mercy and not sacrifice. For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&quot;  --- urlLink Matthew 9:11-13

         24    Then Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.  25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.  26 For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?  27 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.   --- urlLink Matthew 16:24-27    What does Jesus say about "profit" in this message? How do you think that relates to your life?   When the city of Pompeii was excavated, the body of a woman was found, embalmed by the ashes of Vesuvius. Her feet were pointed in the direction of the city gate, but her face was turned back in the direction of her outstretched hand. Just beyond her frozen fingers was found a bag of pearls. In her flight to save her life she had hesitated, though death was hot on her heels. Her hesitation likely cost her her life. Was a bag of pearls really worth that price?   How much is real life worth to you? What is it that you are reaching out for that could cut you off from the life the Lord has for you? Sometimes the very thing we want most may cost us more than we ever dreamed. Think about that area and make a choice to turn away from it, turning your face toward the Lord.

       "Let me explain the problem science has with Jesus Christ." The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.  "You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"  "Yes sir," the student says.  "So you believe in God?"  "Absolutely."  "Is God good?"  "Sure! God's good."  "Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?"  "Yes."  "Are you good or evil?"  "The Bible says I'm evil."  The professor grins knowingly. "Aha! The Bible!" He considers for a moment.  "Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would you try?"  "Yes sir, I would."  "So you're good...!"  "I wouldn't say that."  "But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't."  The student does not answer, so the professor continues.  "He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?"  The student remains silent.  "No, you can't, can you?" the professor says. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.  "Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?"  "Er...yes," the student says.  "Is Satan good?"  The student doesn't hesitate on this one. "No."  "Then where does Satan come from?"  The student falters. "From...God..."  "That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?"  "Yes, sir."  "Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?"  "Yes."  "So who created evil?"  Again, the student has no answer.  "Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness. All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?"  The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."  "So who created them?"  The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question.  "Who created them?"  There is still no answer  Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized.  "Tell me," he continues onto another student. "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"  The student's voice betrays him and cracks. "Yes, professor. I do."  The old man stops pacing. "Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?"  "No sir. I've never seen Him."  "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"  "No, sir. I have not."  "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter."  "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."  "Yet you still believe in him?"  "Yes."  "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?"  "Nothing," the student replies. "I only have my faith."  "Yes, faith," the professor repeats. "And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith."  The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of His own.  "Professor, is there such thing as heat?"  "Yes," the professor replies. "There's heat."  "And is there such a thing as cold?"  "Yes, son, there's cold too."  "No sir, there isn't."  The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain.  "You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that.   There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than -458 degrees. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."  Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.  "What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?"  "Yes," the professor replies without hesitation. "What is night if it isn't darkness?"  "You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light... but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word. In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?"  The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester.  "So what point are you making, young man?"  "Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed."  The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. "Flawed? Can you explain how?"  "You are working on the premise of duality," the student explains. "You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a  thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it."  "Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?"  "If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do."  "Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"  The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going.  A very good semester indeed.  "Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?"  The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.  "To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean."  The student looks around the room. "Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?" The class breaks out into laughter. "Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir. So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?"  Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable.  Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. "I guess you'll have to take them on faith."

         14 Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.  --- urlLink Isaiah 7:14     2  &quot;But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though you are little among the thousands of Judah,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet out of you shall come forth to Me  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The One to be Ruler in Israel,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose goings forth are from of old,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From everlasting.&quot;   --- urlLink Micah 5:2        Seven hundred years before Christ was born, the prophets Isaiah and Micah gave us specific signs to look for in the birth of the Messiah...that He would be born of a virgin and that Bethlehem would be the town blessed with His birth. These were just two of the many, many prophesies of what was to come. And when God's time came for these things to be accomplished, He made sure that they happened just as He decreed that they would.       So a young maiden became pregnant without ever knowing a man. Her fiancee accepted the fact of the source of her pregnancy, rather than throwing her out and having her stoned to death as would have been his right. And Caesar Augustus just thought the decree for the census was his idea! In fact, it was God's means of assuring that His Son would be born in Bethlehem, rather than in Joseph's home town of Nazareth.       God hasn't stopped planning ahead. Everything that is happening today is according to His will. He knew before the foundations of the earth that everything that is happening today would occur....and would occur at the time that He decreed it.      You think that you have your job because you interviewed well, or you were the most qualified for the job, or because you had good references, or knew the right people. All of those things might be true. But they are true because that is what God ordained. You could have the worst references, interviewed poorly, and have forgotten to take your resume to the interview, but if God wanted you to have that job, you would have had it, no matter what.       It's the same with all the other areas of your life, no matter how wonderful or how difficult they may seem. God is in complete control of everything in your life. Learn to trust Him in all areas of your life and know that if it is for the good, it will happen, no matter what.

      An implied or indirect reference to something assumed to be known, such as an historical event or personage, a well-known quotation from literature, or a famous work of art, such as Keats' allusion to Titian's painting of Bacchus in "Ode to a Nightingale." Sidelight: An allusion can be used by the poet as a means of imagery, since, like a symbol, it can suggest ideas by connotation; its effectiveness, of course, depends upon the reader's acquaintance with the reference alluded to.

Sobrang ang sakit sa mata  . Pero ngayon buti di na masyado. Nagagalit na nga yung mga ka-guild ko, bakit di na raw ako masyado naglalaro. Sabi ko medyo busy sa work ( ).   Ewan ko ba kung bakit andami naadik dito. Unang-una may bayad yung paglalaro (bukod pa yun sa bill ng internet connection ha). Pangalawa sobrang daming bugs nung game. Siguro ang lakas na hatak nung element na pwede kang makipag-sosyalan sa iba ding mga players habang naglalaro. Hehe.    Anyway, I'm still hoping na sana mapa-abot ko yung character ko ng level 99 (yun na yung highest level na pwede). And sana di maubusan ng pambili ng game time.

       urlLink     "Out of the ash  I rise with my red hair  And I eat men like air."   Yan, sya yan. Pinaka-idol kong poet. Medyo dark yung mga poems nya pero astig. "American writer whose best-known poems are noted for their personal imagery and intense focus."  Her poems are somewhat confessional which critics claim na nakuha nya from Robert Lowell, isa ding poet. What made me admire this girl is that she lived a life of poetry.   Alam nyo bang naging model sya? She was married to Ted Hughes, a popular poet at that time pero di rin naging successful yung marriage. Sylvia discovered Ted's affair with Assia Wevill, wife of Canadian poet David Wevill.  Then after sometime, Plath decided to kill herself. Near the end of her life, Plath burned hundreds of pages of a work in progress. In one of her final poems she wrote: "Dying / is an art, like everything else. / I do it exceptionally well." (from  urlLink Lady Lazarus )  Alam nyo ba kung paano sya nagpakamatay? On the night of February 11, 1963, Sylvia made a plate of bread and butter for her sleeping children, placed it on the kitchen table with glasses of milk, and put her head in a gas oven, dying by carbon monoxide poisoning .  How poetic. Sniff.

       Overnight, very Whitely, discreetly, Very quietly  Our toes, our noses Take hold on the loam, Acquire the air.  Nobody sees us, Stops us, betrays us; The small grains make room.  Soft fists insist on Heaving the needles, The leafy bedding,  Even the paving. Our hammers, our rams, Earless and eyeless,  Perfectly voiceless, Widen the crannies, Shoulder through holes. We  Diet on water, On crumbs of shadow, Bland-mannered, asking  Little or nothing. So many of us! So many of us!  We are shelves, we are Tables, we are meek, We are edible,  Nudgers and shovers In spite of ourselves. Our kind multiplies:  We shall by morning Inherit the earth. Our foot's in the door.

       I Heard from someone that last year, there were 2 major phenomena:  urlLink Friendster  and the book  urlLink The Purpose Driven Life .   Yung Friendster alam na naman siguro natin kung bakit tayo naaliw dun so concentrate na lang tayo sa Purpose Driven Life tutal review naman talaga to ng Purpose Driven Life na book eh (labo! )  "It's not about you. It's about Him." Yan ang makikita mo sa first page ng first chapter. The author knows na yung mga bibili ng book na to dahil na-attract sila ng title (meron akong kakilala na nagsabi na ampanget daw ng cover, mukhang boring. Don't judge a book by it's cover! ), eh yung mga individual na ika nga eh nagso-"soul searching". Actually ako, isa sa mga nagulat ng mga lines na yan. We have always thought that we are all finding our purpose in life para maging masaya and maging fulfilled tayo but this book will tell you to have a paradigm shift so that you may have a better perspective in finding your purpose. This book will also make you realize na sometimes, in finding your purpose, nakakalimutan mo na you are created under God's plan. Kung hindi ka sumusunod sa naplano ng Diyos para sa yo, then you are not fulfilling your purpose at all. Nagtutunog preacher na ba ako? Hehe.    Masarap basahin yung book. Yung instruction sa book one chapter a day pero ako tinodo-todo ko, hehe, rebelde ako eh. Minsan syempre masakit yung sinasabi pero sabi nga di ba,  urlLink "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." . Naalala ko tuloy yung Matrix Movie. Kasi nagising yung mga humans dun di ba, and na-realize nila kinokontrol lang sila ng mga machines. Actually, makikita mo na mahirap makipaglaban sa mga machines and actually, pwede naman silang bumalik na lang sa dati nilang mundo, to go with the flow, and managinip sa Matrix world. Pero ibig sabihin nun, you would be living in world of make believe. Kumbaga, mabubuhay ka sa isang malaking kasinungalingan. Dun ko na-realize sa movie na yun ang totoong ibig sabihin ng "The truth will set you free."  Anyway, napalayo na tayo sa topic , hehe. Basta ang buong sinasabi lang ng book, a purpose driven life is a God-centered life. Yun lang. Kung ikaw ay naghahanap ng purpose sa buhay mo at wala ang Diyos dun, naliligaw ka pero babalik at babalik ka din sa Diyos. Kung hindi ka naman naghahanap ng purpose sa buhay, abnormal ka (hehe, baka ma-correct ako ).  Yun lang po. I thank you.

       urlLink    Yep, that's the dreaded sharingan   Sobrang hanga talaga ako sa gumawa nitong Naruto na to. Ang gumawa nga pala ay si  urlLink Masashi Kishimoto . Ewan ko pero sobrang nagalingan ako sa kwento. Nakakaaliw. Meron kasing nagdownload na kaibigan ko ng lahat ng episodes hanggang episode 84, kaya ayun naadik ako. Inabot pa nga ako ng ala-sais ng umaga sa office dahil sa panonod nung mga episodes. Yung mga mata ko lumuluwa na nun at sumusuko na sa panonood pero yung mind ko gusto pang manood.   Ngayon nga nagaaral na akong ng mga ninjutsu/techniques hehe. Eto mga samples ng mga hand seals, baka maging interested kayo (images courtesy of > urlLink Naruto Fan.Com ) :      Nezumi  (Rat)     O-ushi (Ox)     Tora  (Tiger)     Usagi  (Hare)      Ryu  (Dragon)     Hebi  (Serpent)     Uma  (Horse)     O-hitsuji  (Ram)     Saru  (Monkey)      Tori  (Bird)      Inu  (Dog)      Ousu-buta  (Boar)

      Ang hirap din pala pag ang layo ng bahay ng girlfriend mo. Taga, Bicutan kasi ako tapos yung GF ko taga Novaliches. Hehe.    Pero ok na din, medyo mas nagiging exciting ang buhay kasi halos hatinggabi na ako nagta-travel pag hinahatid ko sya. Andaming nade-develop sa akin.   Tumatalas ang aking senses sa pagdetect at gumagaling ako sa pag-iwas ng mga holdaper, snatcher, laslas boys, at mga pick-up girls na nangungulit     Pakiramdam ko kumakapal ang pisngi ko kasi sobrang lakas ng hangin sa bus dahil sobrang bilis magpa-takbo, wala kasing trapik     Speaking of traffic, yun nga, walang traffic! Tuwing kelan mo lang ba makikita ang EDSA na walang traffic?   Ang sarap ng mami sa kalye! Sana lang wala pa akong hepatitis, amoebiasis, ebola o anumang kahindik-hindik na sakit     hehe, pero syempre, kahit gaano kalayo pa bahay ng GF ko, oks lang, ganyan ako kabaliw sa kanya eh ( )

      Hmm, after a long hibernation period i decided to go blogging again. hehe.    Hay ano ba. Sangkatutak na challenges. Yan ang kaharap ko ngayon. It's like I'm in an old cowboy movie facing another cowboy and we are preparing to pull our guns to kill each other. But I decided I will kim him first. No bullet will touch my skin.  I discovered yesterday why I love good old music. I tend to contemplate at the good old days. I don't want to face reality, hehe. Sabi nga nung personality test ko -->   urlLink      That's why I tend to escape reality. I always go for fun. But now, I have decided to face that gruesome monster called reality.  Grrrr
