						   I read a post on one of the Yahoo groups to which I belong and I added the following two cents. I thought it was so good I figured I should put it here as well. The previous poster to whom I responded made the comment that Christianity isn't a religion, which I hardly think is accurate, and the following gives some idea of why.  Christianity may not have been intended as a religion, but like you said, we're quite a few centuries late to actually be debating that particular point.  It's interesting that just about every modern religion started out as a philosophy. Christianity and Judaism and Buddhism were all intended as guides to moral living. The Buddha even said he was a normal man and not to be worshipped, but take a trip through Thailand and tell me he isn't. It seems that as time passed these philosophies collected accoutrements of religion, rather like a Lotto winner collects distant cousins. In time, the messiahs and prophets and gods became more important than their message.  I think America is seeing a reversal of this whole catastrophe, unfortunately, it doesn't mean that they are rediscovering the message, but simply, that the accoutrements of religion are losing their eminence.  It's curious that a lot of the virtues discussed in a religious capacity were discussed by the likes of Plato and Aristotle, but they failed to become prophets or messiahs. I guess their failure was in that they didn't couch what they had to say within the trappings of gods and divinity, and thus it lacked validation.  Still, it's a testament to their wisdom that their thoughts survived to modern times and influenced our world so profoundly. It's kind of a shame that what they had to teach only eventually reached the masses through the distillery of religion.  I may have wandered a bit far from the starting point, but I guess my ultimate point is that it doesn't seem that people are interested in hearing that goodness and decency are their own rewards. The threat of hell and the bribe of heaven seem to be much more alluring.

						   I think I ought to say something for my fellow Californians in the southern part of the state. The best I can come up with is that they have my sympathy. It's kind of lame, but sometimes words are horribly inadequate. I'm saddened by their loss and outraged by the knowledge that it needn't have happened.   I will have more to say about this topic in general, but for the time being, I can only say that I hope good fortune will smile on the people who have been affected by the fires.

						   Who says the news isn't entertaining?  I just read that Australia paid Eritrea a million bucks to take a shipload of sheep of their hands. That must have been a fucked up bunch of sheep. Or else Eritreans drive a hard bargain.

						   PETA (I think it means People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) offered a couple thousand pounds of veggie burgers to the town of Rodeo (pronounced roh day oh, by the way) if it will change its name. What's their beef?  PETA doesn't like rodeos.   How droll.

						   The state procession in London has been cancelled due to anti-war protestors. MI-5 and MI-6 can not guarantee the safety of the queen or President Bush. Sympathizers in America are saying that these protestors are rightly making a statement about the evil and imperialistic policies of the Bush administration. Furthermore, they are trying to protect Prime Minister Blair from President Bush's bad influence (when did they become high schoolers? And why would they have elected Blair in the first place if he was such a worthless nincompoop).   I think all this goes to prove that fools can be very dangerous. Since when does Britain or France or any other country in the world tell Americans what they ought to believe? Better yet, since when do Americans eat up what they have to say? By their own admission, the protestors in Britain are trying to influence Americans while we are gearing up for the 2004 election. They are certainly welcome to try, I just hope people ask themselves 'what do these people know about America' before jumping on their bandwagon.  Of course I'm opening myself up for the argument that we're part of the greater world and we must be sensitive to the opinions of the world. Retch. The world does not elect our president or our congress. Americans do.  It's a very slick double standard in my estimation. If America influences the election process in another country we're meddlers and trying to set up a puppet regime. If we allow others to influence our election we're. . . enlightened? Fair players in the global community?   America founded the United Nations right here in San Francisco. We host the UN in New York City, we pay about 20% of its budget. We contributed about $15 billion of our budget to international aid last year, which is more sheer dollars than any other country in the world. I think that's a pretty good track record as far as being fair players in the world community.  Anti-Americanism seems to be the latest fad here at home and the rest of the world loves it. This sentiment seems to be gaining steam in America and I find it somewhat frightening. What do Americans stand to gain by abadoning the philosophy that sent America to the top in favor of systems which are not consistent with the ideals that make America such a remarkable and successful place?   I already know what we have to lose.

						   I supported military action in Iraq for a number of reasons (I have every reason to believe I will be chatting about them in time). But that isn't necessarily the topic of this particular post. President Bush and the powers that be in Iraq have attempted to appropriate reconstruction money for the purchase of garbage trucks.   The Leftists erupted (and have won the battle according to the deal passed by Congress. The purchase of garbage trucks for Iraq is "politically sensitive", and enough Republicans were swayed by their arguments that the appropriation was trimmed). They argued that we have so many problems at home that such an expenditure is unjustified and wasteful. That we need to spend the money on our economy, and our own social institutions. The socially liberal Left, the bastion of the little man, the minority, and the downtrodden souls would rather see the people of Iraq wallow in their own filth than share America's wealth and ingenuity. According to the WHO, appropriate sanitation would eliminate more disease in the world than any other effort. Providing clean water, disposing of garbage, and treating sewage is the single most effective means of reducing mortality the world over. I guess the bleeding hearts don't mind watching children play in piles of trash as long as it's not at home.  Perhaps there are valid arguments against our war with Iraq, but we crossed that bridge some time ago. The war is over, we won. But, the job isn't over until the paperwork is done. The Left would have us simply pack our bags and leave Iraq to its own devices. Who cares that civil war would destroy what little infrastructure remains? What difference does it make that Saddam (who is almost universally considered the scourge of Iraq and a cruel and wicked excuse for a human being) will be replaced by a mirror image? Who cares that such an action is the equivalent of burning every dollar and every life that was spent on Iraq? Liberals insist we shouldn't have gone in the first place. It's not clear to me why simply undoing what we've done is a solution, but maybe that's why I don't make a good Democrat. I believe that whether our course of action was right or wrong, we now have a responsibility to complete what we started.

						   The world's weirdest man has managed to top his previous worst week.  Michael Jackson is in the news again. You're all aware of that. Unless you live in a cave. In any case, a person can't actually have a conversation without discussing the latest weirdness. (The talk radio station I listen to had a great bit. The newsroom went down and the talk show host said "I'll do the news. Michael Jackson's house was searched by police. Michael Jackson last ate at McDonald's. Michael Jackson is charged with child molest. Michael Jackson was last seen in Las Vegas. Michael Jackson is weird. The weather is cool and clear.")  Anyhow, here's my two cents. Michael Jackson is weird. The man is a sad, pathetic, train wreck of a human being. I think he's developmentally and emotionally delayed. I think he's androgynous. I don't believe that he would purposely do anything hurtful to anybody (certainly not out of malice or even gratification). He's an idiot savant who could not survive without a gaggle of advisors and lawyers. He needs to add a couple of shrinks to his coterie.  And who in their right mind would leave their children alone with him? Regardless of the fact that there's a 10 year old living in his head (and what ten year old is capable of caring for the safety and well-being of other children?) there are previous allegations of sexual misconduct with children. I'm not sure I believe that he is capable of molest, but I don't think he's capable of caring for children and I have concerns about the emotional and psychological well-being of his own children.  I rather pity him. It could be a Shakespearian tragedy. After becoming one of the world's greatest entertainers he has created his own Never Land sanctuary only to be driven out by the howling masses. The formula only lacks a suicide for completion.

						   I heard an interview on the news regarding the wildfires in Southern California and the potential for future wildfires in other parts of California and the country. The conclusion was that global warming is the engine behind the increase in wildfires. Greenhouse gas emissions are creating a hotter, dryer climate.  Please. First of all, the earth has had a wildly vacillating climate for as far back as geologists can see. There is no evidence that tells us whether the current changes in climate are the result of natural temperate changes in Earth's weather patterns or the result of greenhouse gas emissions.   Second of all, Occam's Razor gives us an alternative that is more immediately verifiable and easily remedied. The Sierra Club and the EPA (among others)have spent some decades preventing the clearing of dead wood and scrub from forested areas. In the meantime, the National Park Service and Department of Forestry is expected to battle blazes and prevent them from getting out of hand.  They're fighting a losing battle. As time passes and the available fuel becomes greater it will be more and more difficult to battle the fires after they have started.   To this day, you can drive through parts of Yellowstone National Park and see blackened swathes of land stretching out of sight. Yellowstone has had decades to begin regenerating, but thousands and thousands of acres of soil were sterilized by the heat of the fires. It will take many more decades for bacteria to repopulate the soil and possibly centuries for the forest to return to its former level of growth. The same holds true for Oregon and Colorado and, now, California.

						   Last night in my TESOL class one of my classmates commented that her Pakistani friend was incensed by the effort American beauracracy puts in to accomodating speakers of other languages.  It seemed an odd comment. Initially, I thought representing multiple languages would make things easier, but it's not really so simple. A moment of reflection makes a person realize that it's not much of a favor at all.   Business is conducted in English, street signs are in English, the vast majority of television and radio is English, shopping is mostly done in English.  In the end, people may be able to squeak by with their first language, but can hardly be successful in America without speaking English. Indeed, it's hard to imagine that they will be able to integrate at all in America without learning English.   So, I can see why it would make the young Pakistani fellow angry. It's almost a subversion of immigrants' attempts to become Americans which is, after all, what they are trying to do.

						   "ATHENS, Greece - The remake of the 1974 cult horror movie "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" opened Friday in Greece with an introduction demanded by psychiatrists: Schizophrenics aren't always violent. The distributor took the action after Greek psychiatrists demanded that the Greek title be changed because it insulted schizophrenics and stigmatized people with psychological disorders.

						   “STOCKHOLM (AFP) - Contrary to recent US claims that its war on Iraq forced Libya to give up its nuclear weapons program, former UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix said that diplomacy should be given most of the credit.”   I can tell you how the ‘diplomacy’ worked. Bush and Blair convinced Gadhafi that he would need to find his own Hussein style hidey-hole if he didn’t do something differently.  “CHICAGO (AP) - In the midst of the low-carb craze, a new study suggests that by eating lots of carbohydrates and little fat, it is possible to lose weight without actually cutting calories — and without exercising, either.”   Hello? Is anybody home? There are two types of diets. Low carb, hi protein or hi protein, low carb. Every diet ever has recycled these two concepts. They work identically by reducing your caloric intake. If you want to lose weight eat less exercise more.  “SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 29 — With a budget deficit of about $14 billion, California could use a major infusion of positive energy. So it may be appropriate timing that in this most Asian of mainland American regions, State Assemblyman Leland Y. Yee, Democrat of San Francisco, has introduced a resolution that urges the California Building Standards Commission to adopt standards that would aid feng shui, the ancient Chinese practice of promoting health, harmony and prosperity through the environment.”   I swear it’s not a joke. We’re $14 billion in the hole. Who in their right mind could possibly imagine that redecorating government buildings will help solve the problem?  “Reuters: Polymer-based, counterfeit proof banknotes that were also introduced last month were hit by rumors that the bills would be withdrawn because they had no year of issue printed on them. . .  The central bank has been forced to issue stern admonitions.  "Any individual who refuses to circulate the bank notes issued by the State Bank of Vietnam will be named as a lawbreaker and will face tough punishments," deputy governor Nguyen Thi Kim Phung said last month.”   I keep hearing Cartman. “God damn it, Vietnam.”

						   I think to answer that, we need to go way back.  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.   Oops, too far. Actually, I think the Industrial Revolution is a more convenient place to start. More specifically, the Industrial Revolution in the United States. Eli Whitney is a prime example of American creativity with his inventions of interchangeable parts and the cotton gin. During this time, the tone and pace of American industrialization and productivity were set and have continued unabated (excepting the occasional setback) right down to this very day. Henry Ford certainly deserves a mention as a modern example at this point for the assembly line which is practically unchanged and one of the very foundations of modern production methods.  The U.S. was uniquely positioned to take the fullest advantage of the Revolution and adopted it with an enthusiasm that has remained a hallmark of the American people ever since. We had the Christian ethic which translated conveniently and powerfully into the American work ethic, we had (and still have) a vast resource base, and a labor shortage that made the adoption of technology a necessity.  The flavor of American productivity had been set. If we fast forward to around the turn of the 20th Century, the point can be illustrated even more vividly. By that time, the world had seen an explosion in science and the result was a gadgeteers wet-dream. Thomas Edison sort of represents the epitome of this particular phenomenon. People have argued that his greatest invention was the telephone or the lightbulb or the phonograph, but I think his real contribution was the invention of the invention factory. It has become an integral part of many companies like IBM, Xerox, GE, Dow Chemical, and the very structure of others most aptly illustrated by the biotech industry. Companies like Genentech, Celera Genomics, and Curis are in the business of inventing or developing medical treatments by trial and error.  Anyhow, as we carry on through the 20th Century we see how Americans have adopted and pursued technologies with almost feverish enthusiasm and have created entire industries based on such technology. Multi-billion dollar industries have come from American application of the internal combustion engine, powered flight, motion pictures, television, radio transmission, telephone communication, transistors, and the internet.   In the current climate of exported jobs, failed health care initiatives, and a creaking educational system, people are asking what's there? Why should we go? I think a more telling question might be what will find on our way there? Our efforts to explore and conquer the space surrounding our little chunk of dirt will unquestionably lead to new technology and new industry and of all the people in the world, I think it is the Americans who will ultimately prove capable of capitalizing this new frontier. Bush's challenge to NASA is not simply for the sake of going to the Moon or to Mars, it is to demonstrate that there are real tangible benefits to such exploration. It is to foster corporate research and investment into new technologies and new industries for the long-term benefit of America.   It might not do a lot of the short term health of America. Everybody immediately says yeah, that sounds great but what about the problems today? Well, my response to that is we can pour a bazillion dollars into welfare and unemployment, but it won't improve the problem. My experience working for social services has taught me that our current welfare system creates a vicious circle of dependence and often doesn't do anybody any real favors. Money spent on a long-term vision is immeasurably preferable to an 'instant gratification' solution even if it isn't so sympathetic.

						   The primary in New Hampshire is winding down. I think Kerry will take it. It's certainly shaping up to be an interesting election. We're still early in the race and I think it would be premature to make any predictions beyond what's going on in New Hampshire right now. But the campaigning is fascinating. So, I'm going to take a few minutes to make some observations and maybe speculate (just a little).   The Democrats are not really inspiring confidence in their party at this point. The in-fighting and back-biting is pretty intense and I think it will affect the overall success of their bid for the White House. Another thing that seems to be happening is that the foundation of their campaign is to beat George Bush (the one thing they agree on). It sounds good to the left wingers. California will certainly eat it up. But I don't think it will help them much in middle of the road states. They come across as saying "I'm not great but I'm better than Bush." This is really the same logic that was used before the war "No matter how bad Saddam Hussein is, President Bush is worse." It didn't work very well then either. I think the Democrats are playing not to lose instead of playing to win. There's a huge difference.

						   Gay marriage has been something of a hot-button topic of late. I think it’s more of an attention getter than an actual issue of any import. The debate is fascinating but even though I’m a gay man, this particular issue parallels my opinion of God’s existence.  God says so.  I could be generously described as an agnostic. I don’t know whether God exists. The evidence at hand makes me suspect He doesn’t. While the history of religion and its influence on history, politics, and culture is fascinating, I don’t really believe that the actual question of God’s (or Gods’) existence(s) is terribly relevant.  Marriage is an institution dedicated to successful procreation.   Fair enough. People get married for the sake of raising children. Does that mean sterile couples should not be allowed to marry? What about post-menopausal women? I suppose it could even be argued that based on this position marriages should be dissolved after menopause but I think a minimum of 18 years of hell is worth something. The defense is that sterile men and women slip through the cracks because it’s not feasible to determine whether they actually are sterile. Post-menopausal women may have already had children but gotten divorced or widowed and could be entitled to marriage because they have successfully procreated. But if marriage is dedicated to successful procreation why is it not made requisite that marriage applicants provide proof of their ability and intent to procreate? This argument blatantly grasps at straws in an attempt to arbitrarily exclude homosexuals from marriage (and it makes me think of that woman on South Park who always screams “What about the children? Think of the children!”)  Gay marriage will undermine the sanctity of marriage.   This is dangerously close to a religious argument, but in its secular form the idea is that gays are making a mockery of marriage by pretend-marrying. Taken a step further this argument also suggests that heterosexuals will then start believing that marriage itself is somewhat farcical. For pretend-marriage one only need look as far as Las Vegas (think Brittney Spears). Furthermore, I’ve read that internet divorces are pending in some states. If marriage is sanctified how appropriate is a point and click divorce? The second point would insult me if I were straight and married and my example is best formed as a question. Do you honestly believe that someone else’s homosexual marriage will make your heterosexual marriage less meaningful? I pity those of you who answer yes.  The previous arguments are sort of the foundation of the anti gay marriage faction. The first is somewhat persuasive (“Won’t somebody please think of the children?!”). But it is lacking, especially in light of the adoption situation. I actually can argue the reverse. If marriage is in the best interests of children, gay marriage should be encouraged because it will increase the pool of families willing to adopt. I know from experience working for CPS that there are more children than there are adoptive parents and that is a very sad situation.  Gay marriage will provide an example for heterosexuals.   An optimistic argument if not wildly inaccurate (and potentially hypocritical). And also insultingly self-serving to my mind. In theory, straight couples will be inspired by gays who, having no ulterior incentive, remain together in loving devoted monogamous relationships. First, I think gays have a lot of proving to do in this respect. The record is not encouraging. Second, most straight couples will probably be slightly negative of neutral on gay marriage. They will be vaguely uncomfortable with the general idea but probably will be willing to live and let live. In fact they probably would simply prefer not to know (Too much information! Must go blind!). The idea that they will care so much about the opinion of homosexual couples is flat out ludicrous. This argument is diametric to the sanctity of marriage. While both effectively fan the flames neither has any substance.  We’re people too. We deserve the same rights as everybody else.   I think this is the most swaying argument. America’s foundation is the belief that people should be allowed to live as they see fit provided it doesn’t infringe upon the rights of others. Some may find homosexuality distasteful but it doesn’t contravene anybody’s rights. We see here a perfect opportunity to agree to disagree (an American art form). It makes me think of a scene from X-2 where Nightcrawler asks Mystique why she doesn’t stay in disguise all the time. She responds, “Because we shouldn’t have to.” I agree. The thing is while gays may not be expressly permitted to marry we are still capable of pursuing the same legal benefits. It doesn’t matter to estate lawyers or insurers who is chosen as beneficiary. Many agencies approve homosexual adoptions. The latest trend suggests that many companies don’t necessarily mind extending benefits to same-sex partners. Again, this argument sounds good, but upon examination it makes me think that what gay marriage proponents are fighting for is a slip of paper with somebody else’s signature on it.  I believe marriage is a mutual, inter-personal agreement between two people based on love, trust, and honesty. No amount of priestly blessings or judicial gavel-pounding can make that agreement more or less binding than the convictions of the people entering the agreement. What this means is that I am neutral on the issue of gay marriage. I don’t need anybody to approve my commitment to the person I love. Besides, it might just be me, but don’t gay rights activists sound like a bunch of whiners?  I do, however, think there is a deeper, more subtle issue at hand. Does the federal government have the authority to determine this issue for the entire union? I don’t believe that it does. The individual states have the authority to determine the application of their own respective civil union laws and common property laws and I don’t believe that it is within the right of the federal government to make this decision.   The spectre of a Constitutional Amendment has been raised by President Bush. I think it unlikely that Americans can be persuaded to add an amendment to the Constitution for the sake of defining marriage. Americans learned their lesson with Prohibition and there is almost no possibility whatsoever that the necessary votes could be collected for a Constitutional Convention on such a frivolous issue.  One last thought I have on the matter is that American society is powerfully self-correcting. It may take years or decades but the social institutions in America will continue to drift in a liberal direction. We are in the midst of the greatest social and political experiment ever and one that has never at any point been taken lightly. Our forefathers put in place a framework which permits (and encourages) change but one that prevents radical and potentially destabilizing change. For a significant time, America was considered the most liberal of nations. Europeans assumed that liberalism was one of the secrets to our success and leapfrogged forward dramatically, making America one of the “Last great conservative nations in the world.” I saw a recent magazine article (I’m afraid I don’t remember the publication) that compared the nations of the world in terms of liberalism. Most of Europe was considered extremely liberal, value-driven and ‘progressive’ while the United States was described as conservative and belief-driven (their little chart actually compared us more closely to the Islamic world than the European world). I was thoroughly pissed after reading the article. The gist of it was that America is somehow deficient and backward. It was cleverly written, but standard left-wing rhetoric nonetheless. Apparently, our nation is fundamentalist in its own right and compares unfavorably with the enlightened nations of Europe. They all seem to miss the point. America is an experiment, carefully controlled through its own corrective properties. We are slow to change, not because we can’t but because we try to be as certain as possible that the change is in our best interests. That is why I am not passionate about the issue of gay marriage. Eventually it will become a non-issue. Gay marriage will then be permitted out of apathy if for no other nobler reason.

						   "I see no reason why Iran should backtrack on its pledges," ElBaradei said, adding that U.N. inspectors were working in Iran this week. "Obviously it would have serious implications if they do not cooperate fully with us ... I hope and I am confident they will continue to cooperate." Are these the same serious implications the UN leveled against Iraq for its lack of cooperation? Please.  The Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, out of courtesy to the world court, asked a state Appeals Court to delay the execution of Osbaldo Torres, a Mexican citizen. You know. . . As a traveler I am aware that during my stay in a foreign country I am subject to the laws of that nation. I am reminded of the case of that young American man who was caned in Singapore for vandalizing some cars. Torres was convicted and sentenced in accordance with American law. Tend your own knitting, world court.  U.S. forestry officials announced on Thursday that they would significantly expand the amount of logging allowed in California's Sierra Nevada mountains in what they described as an effort to curb wildfires. . . "I personally witnessed the human suffering and catastrophic damage caused by those fires," Forest Service Regional Forester Jack Blackwell said.  "I am personally convinced that future droughts in the Sierra Nevada, coupled with periods of wind and high temperatures, could lead to the same devastation there," he said in a statement. "It is my professional responsibility to take decisive action." All I can say is . . . Thank you! And I would like to plug a great website at this point: [url=http://www.pushback.com [link]]   Bob Keeshan, who gently entertained and educated generations of children as television's walrus-mustachioed Captain Kangaroo, died Friday at 76.

						   I hadn't intended to post today, but I came across an article that made my head want to explode.  "The Bush administration has alternately fought with, derided and sidelined the United Nations (news - web sites) for more than a year as it pursued the war in Iraq (news - web sites), then reserved postwar authority mostly for itself.  But now American officials are asking the United Nations for assistance in getting out of a dangerous political stalemate in the still embattled country. "  So, it seems we've seen the error of our ways and gone crawling back to the wise and powerful UN.   Or not. The United States is not interested in creating a 51st state in the Middle East. We do not expect the Iraqis to arbitrarily adopt our exact form of government. In fact, we have encouraged discussion and consideration from the people in Iraq. The United States is not asking for help from the United Nations because we are incapable of arriving at a solution to the impasse. We are asking for help from the United Nations because Iraq is asking for that help.   The United States's philosophy in Iraq is not to control that country. Nor do we see it as our job to instruct them on the shape their government should take. The United States military is in Iraq and will stay their to guarantee that the people of Iraq are allowed to choose their own style of government.  We will not allow despots or fundamentalists to seize power. We will not allow civil war or rebellion. We will not allow a return to tyranny in any form. But we will allow the Iraqis to seek out the assistance and information they feel they need to build the kind of place they wish to live in. Even if that means sending an invitation to the United Nations for their help.  These smug bastards who are laughing in their sleeves because we've gotten our "comeuppance" are setting themselves up for a rude awakening. What they don't seem to recognize is that the American military is the rule of law in Iraq until the Iraqis find their own rule of law. While the United Nations will be allowed to advise and observe and suggest they will not be allowed to decide, determine or administrate. That power will be jealously guarded for the citizens of Iraq by the strength of the United States.

						   Lisbon, 2000 the European Union challenged itself to oust the U.S. as the world's most competitive economy. Today results are "mixed" (read failing miserably).  France and Germany are not even meeting the requirements for participation in the EU with deficits in excess of 3 percent of their GDP (and getting a free ride on the back of the Euro currency). Unemployment is above 8 percent. Productivity grew at a rate of less than 1 percent. Meanwhile, conservative fiscal policies aimed at protecting local European economies have inflated the value of the Euro (as compared with aggressive Fed policies and their effect on the value of the dollar).  What does all this mean? It means the EU is cutting off its nose to spite its face. Businesses are afraid to invest in Europe because of entitlements (also read taxes) and the risks involved with bankruptcy in Europe during poor economic situations. People don't care if they work because of entitlements (this time read welfare) and because they don't get much of a paycheck after taxes are taken to pay for others' entitlements. Their attempts to insulate Europe from American economic influence means that the price of European exports can't compete with American products, tourists don't feel they can afford to visit Europe, and foreign companies don't want to invest in that climate. It's a vicious circle really.   They have attempted to model a federal economy in Europe after the American example. However, they've missed a few crucial points (or perhaps ignored them for various reasons). First, Europeans have never found the idea of a free-enterprise market economy a very comfortable thing to contemplate. The socialist unions have the reins of power firmly in hand and refuse to permit businesses the freedom to pursue financially competitive strategies. Second, the EU thinks it is in competition with the U.S. That alone places them at a disadvantage as compared to America. The EU is not only attempting to become more competitive than the U.S. it is attempting to undermine us. Their economic policies are intended to harm us as much as they are intended to help the EU. While we are not in competition with Europe we aren't above taking advantage of them (Frontier Law "Them what's first, gits.") and everybody has to admit that Americans are nothing if not good at exploiting economic opportunity. Approve or not, people all over the world love American labels and America is well aware of this fact.  Why do you think that the Fed has maintained interest rates at such historically low levels? Why is the greenback being allowed to devalue? Why are American productivity and exports exploding while the EU is creaking ahead with glacial momentum?  Partly because we have seen the shape of EU economics and in the spirit of laissez-faire we have seized the opportunity. By maintaining low interest rates we encourage investment and expansion from American investors and by initiating a controlled devaluation of American currency we practically create a market for our exports. In short the EU has inadvertently (and I have to say somewhat stupidly) handed us a golden egg on a silver platter.

						   It's been a while since I've had time to update my blog. I started my holiday travelling in November so I haven't had a lot of time or opportunity for updating.  In any case, I think that the coming of the new year presents an opportunity to look back and maybe learn a little bit about where we might be headed.  Globalization has been a big topic in the news recently. Specifically, jobs are being exported at breakneck speeds. Software engineers and customer service representatives and manufacturers are losing jobs in America. Apparently it's all for globalization. Well, I'm not a citizen of "Globali." I want Americans to have jobs and make money and lead the lives they want to lead. Citizens of Globali need to figure out their own means of living. It is not America's duty to employ the rest of the world. I fear it's too late to think that it can be undone.  Some think my attitude is selfish, greedy, lacking compassion. Sorry folks, but why am I obligated to feel more badly for the rest of the world than I do for my own fellow countrymen? I'm not heartless or completely without compassion. America should help the rest of the world when help is needed. We have done so for more than half a century.  We have propped up failing economies with American money. We have rushed to the aid of flood and earthquake and fire disasters in every corner of the world. We have built and rebuilt collapsing infrastructures in Europe, Africa, Asia and South America. We have given billions in aid and billions more in loan forgiveness. Perhaps even more tellingly, American citizens have given their own personal time and money to aid citizens of other countries. Volunteers have raced to help the victims of disaster simply out of the goodness of their own hearts.   Who has responded in kind? We are not immune to trouble or disaster. When tornadoes flatten half the mid-west and earthquakes raze towns and cities on the west coast and the Mississippi River floods and hurricanes crash into the east coast and wildfires burn hundreds of thousands of acres what do we get? We get a moue of sympathy.  The record does not make me angry or bitter. It makes me a bit sad and dis-spirited. I'm proud to think that Americans remember where they've come from. I'm proud that the people of this country know that the world is a small place and that it is right that we should offer help to our fellow humans in times of need.   Given the record as it stands now, I wouldn't blame America if we pulled our aid efforts from the world theater and lined our borders with the National Guard and sent a sympathy card when 50,000 people die in an Iranian earthquake instead of sending money and engineers and medicine and volunteers. It would be as much as we've been offered.  But, in looking at the past I think Americans have learned that two wrongs don't make a right. I think that, as a people, Americans possess unequaled creativity and ingenuity and nearly bottomless generosity.  In looking to the future, I suspect we will continue down the one-way street towards Globali. Money and food and medicine and technology and creativity and even jobs will flow from America for the sake of the huddled masses who have not or can not come to our golden shores. We will bear the envy and bitterness and back-biting of the citizens of Globali. And in the meantime America's kindness, cleverness, and ingenuity will guarantee that hard times will always be followed by good.

						   My good friend Andre sent me another tidbit from Barbados. It's interesting just because it's Caribbean.  Apparently Barbados is the bully of the Caribbean (like the US is the bully of the rest of the world). Barbados has the strongest economy in the region and supports a big part of Trinidad and Tobago's economy. Nevermind that Trinidad and Tobago is many times larger than Barbados and wallows in mineral resources.   Anyhow, in return for Barbadian economic good will, Trinidad seizes their fishing ships that wander into Trinidad's economic zone. The Barbadian prime minister got a little tired of this and threatened to cut all ties with Trinidad. Trinidad of course threatened to take action if Barbados made efforts to damage Trinidad's economy.  It's an interesting pickle. Barbados could sue in the UN Court. Of course Trinidad has a right to defend their exclusive maritime zone so I suspect Barbados would lose in court. I also discovered that Barbados has an armed forces. Amazing, no?  Anyhow, it reminds me of other goings on in the world. Why do people bite the hands that feed them?

						   I found a lot of interesting things to write about today. I stumbled across the Democratic Underground forum. Their rules page is entertaining in the extreme. There will definitely be a post about that.  Gavin Newsom (San Francisco Mayor) threw some gas on the gay marriage fire. I really would like to write on that but I've done a number of posts on that topic recently. For now, sufice it to say that I think the issue is spiralling out of control and will probably result in a less than favorable situation. Dumb fucks.  The really fascinating thing I came across today is an article on the Foreign Policy in Focus website called "African Policy Outlook 2004".   AIDS was a big topic in the report. The authors excoriated the United States for failing to provide leadership and money for the UN's Global Fund. I can't deny that the Global Fund is a good idea. But, as with all things UN, the US is expected to pay the bill and somebody, anybody, else gets to spend the money.   The report says: "The U.S. has promised only $200 million per year over the next five years--this is less than one-tenth of what would represent the U.S. ' fair share." The U.S. pledged 1.6 billion dollars through 2008. This is more than twice any other pledge to date, approximately 1/3 of the total amount pledged. I think we've done good by the Global Fund.   The U.S. has provided a significant amount of money to the Global Fund, and allowed it to be used as the UN sees fit. But, in the interest of our own interests the U.S. created the Global AIDS initiative. It has been funded with 2.3 billion dollars and is working with American biotech firms. Africa Action says: "It is likely to pose a challenge in its approach, favoring prevention over treatment, and its close ties with the pharmaceutical industry raise serious questions about its commitment to ensuring low cost access to treatment for HIV/AIDS programs in Africa." Close ties with pharmaceuticals is a liability? The very people who research and produce drugs should not be associated with AIDS research? My density is greater than I thought. Foolish man that I am, thought that bringing the forces of market competition to bear on the situation would speed the efforts and increase the over-all funding on research and development. And how is an approach favoring prevention a bad thing? I was taught that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Finding a cure for AIDS  should  be secondary to finding a vaccine. Finding a cure is important but that means playing catch-up. AIDS will not stop spreading once a cure is found. It will stop once a vaccine is found.  The remainder of the report discusses human development, economic development and strategic attitudes towards Africa. It's mostly not very realistic. For some unknown reason, the US is responsible for every bad thing happening in Africa and if we give them enough money and aid, Africa will magically transform into a happy family of peaceful wealthy democratic nations. I submit that the problems plaguing Africa could not be solved if every resource at America's disposal were dedicated to Africa. Disease, famine, poverty, civil war, attempted genocide. Diving into the African morass would be foolhardy. The U.S. does and should provide aid to Africa, but the idea that we have some sort of responsibility (or realistic ability) to solve their problems is a bad joke at best.  The report argues that the U.S. approaches Africa from an imperialist perspective. We see Africa as a puddle of resources we can draw from at will and a potential base of military operations. They complain that our aid to Africa is unduly balanced in favor of combatting terrorism and that anything else we provide African nations is in the interest of securing resources (specifically oil, of course). The numbers probably support their premise, I haven't researched them, but I think their premise is faulty. Africa is largely lawless. It is in everybody's best interest to see that Africa has the capacity to combat terrorism. As the Middle East becomes more dangerous for terrorists, they will gravitate to Africa where they will be relatively safe. Who would notice another fellow walking around with an AK-47 when half the continent is consumed by civil wars?  The economics in Africa are not much better, but throwing money at them won't help either. The U.S. is interested in importing resources from Africa and there are good reasons for it. Africa Action implies that the U.S. is intent on raping Africa as the Europeans did in the 1800s. I think our resistance to expanding assistance in Africa belies that opinion. America has seen that Africa is all but hopeless at this point. Miring ourselves more deeply in the mess would only hemorrhage money and resources from America and would ultimately be of little benefit to the people of Africa.   It's a no-brainer that we would be interested in African oil, and for more than one reason. It is a resource that African nations can use to build their own wealth and their own economies and it weakens the strangle-hold Middle Eastern countries have on OPEC. The Middle East remains a dangerous place. Saudis have had their hand at America's throat for decades through their influence in OPEC. Developing resources (oil and otherwise) in other parts of the world levels the playing field.  The concluding paragraph of Africa Action's report says: "As the U.S. presidential election looms at the end of the year, it remains to be seen whether an alternative candidate can successfully articulate a different vision of U.S. global leadership, more responsive to international challenges." In translation they want a president who is willing to be instructed by the UN. One who will be willing to fight loosing battles and achieve nothing without the sanction of the world at large. I hope their wish goes unanswered.

						   I'm not sure California legislators could be more useless. Feng Shui and now foie gras. The San Francisco Chronicle says: "State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, is expected to introduce a bill this week that would virtually prohibit foie gras by essentially putting the Western United States' sole producer out of business while denying chefs ready access to the hyper-fattened duck liver."  Ducks or geese are force fed grain which engorges their liver to produce the delicacy. PETA says the ducks don't like it much. Of course, I don't suppose they like giving up their eggs much either. And I don't suppose cattle like to be slaughtered for t-bones. And sheep probably aren't thrilled with sheering day. And I'm fairly certain chickens would rather keep their heads.  I have a hard time thinking that it's appropriate legislation. If you don't approve of foie gras don't eat it. But don't determine that nobody should be allowed to eat it. What really makes me crazy is Senator Burton's comment: "I've eaten foie gras. It ain't my cup of tea." Does that mean that if it were he wouldn't be pushing the legislation?

						   It was kind of a slow day news-wise. The death penalty case at San Quentin is interesting, but I want to wait and see what the 9th Circuit does. I do have a question though. Does anybody care that Denzel Washington and Mike Farrell are lobbying against the sentence?  Courtesy my good friend Andre from Barbados, three Festival Cruise ships have been impounded in various ports. Apparently Festival owes money to the French company Alstom (the people who built the Queen Mary 2). Festival Cruises (based in Genoa) says that it is in negotiations and that it is still a viable company. Passengers were stuck in port for a couple of days while the two companies bickered over who had to pay to send them home. I would love to find out who footed the bill.   Michael Moore is adding more detritus to the puddle of left-wing demagoguery(sp?). According to Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9-11 won't answer the question "Why do they hate us?" but will attempt to answer the question "Why don't they hate us?" It reminded me of an op/ed by Ted Rall that just about sent me off the deep end. Read "Suffer the French Schoolchildren." It's a guaranteed adrenaline rush.  I heard John Kerry say on the radio that President Bush is a worse president than all of the previous eleven presidents combined. And has cooties. So nyaa. (I made up the cooties part). Doesn't exactly make the heart swell with confidence does it? Tell me again that the Democrats aren't campaigning on the "It's not much but it's better than Bush" platform.

						   I already posted my general opinion of the gay marriage issue. It really is a fascinating debate though. I didn't think I would be writing on this topic again so soon, but I've been toddling about on the web and found something I think is very interesting. I have to modify some of my previous thoughts on the granting of gay marriage as a state right. Although I still don't believe that it will become a Constitutional Amendment.  I exchanged some comments with a fellow about gay marriage and the potential for a Constitutional Amendment prohibiting or precluding gay marriage. User jimdoney says: "The defense of marriage act has been passed nationally and has been subsequentally passed in over 75% of the states in this union." There's more but I will get to that in a little bit. I did my homework and found a transcription of the act which says: "No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship."  I then remembered something from my high school government class about the provisions granted to the states in the constitution. I once more toddled about and found a text of the Constitution. Article IV, Section 1 says: "Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof."  The Defense of Marriage Act wriggles through Section 1 where Congress can "prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof." Presumably marriage is proved by Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act by the following: "In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."  Vermont chose a wiser course of action by granting civil unions. It's not hugely popular among a lot of people but it is marginally more palatable than marriage and has the potential to sneak under the wire of the Defense of Marriage Act.  Anyhow, I ran across a prophecy of doom article on The Intellectual Conservative. I think his consideration is misguided at best. The meat of the article was that should we redefine marriage we will open the door to a never ending degradation of the institution of marriage where people will be marrying their favorite farm animals and NAMBLA (the circus freak rejects) will be clamoring for ever-broadened definitions of marriage. I summarily reject his concern for the simple reason that animals are property and while they may be protected by various laws, they are incapable of entering into legal agreements (they're animals for Christ's sake!). NAMBLA I can also reject because of the age of consent. Minors are precluded from entering legal contracts. Besides paedophilia (sp?) is a serious criminal offense and as far as I'm concerned paedophiles ought to be dancing at the end of a rope upon conviction.  Which sort of brings me back to Mr. jimdoney and my doubts regarding the passage of another Amendment on this issue. Mr. jimdoney says: ". . . what makes you think that a rallying cry of people trying to make the same fundamentals of an act that has already recieved approval nationally will be squashed when all they are trying to do is make the fundamentals of the act untoucheable through ammendment ratification?"  Sorry, but it's not a matter of "all they are trying to do." It's tinkering with the very foundations of freedom and equality that makes our country unique in all of history. People do not take that issue lightly. Only once in over 200 years has the Constitution been used specifically to limit the rights of Americans, and that was in 1917 with the Prohibition Amendment. It was an abject failure and was repealed in 1933.   I think the lesson to be learned from Prohibition was that the Constitution must never be used to limit the rights of the people of the United States. That is what a defense of marriage amendment would be, a constitutional limitation to the rights of American citizens. Homosexuals represent about 4 percent of the American population. Voicing our passion to live freely is our only recourse in American politics as our combined numbers are a drop in the bucket. A Constitutional Amendment could be passed even if every homosexual closeted or otherwise voted against ratification.   Such an amendment is a chink in the armor of Constitutional protection. Defining marriage seems a small thing and favors a vast majority of Americans. But does it not open a door better left closed? Does it not set a precedent that the Constitution can be used not only to protect the rights of citizens but also to take them away? Gays may not yet have a legal right to marry, but an Amendment means we may never have that right.  I don't like the Defense of Marriage Act very much, but I will abide by the laws of this nation because I believe we have the right of things and good sense will prevail. I think the Defense of Marriage Act is in accord with the Constitution and is sufficient protection until people can decide whether gay marriage is really the scourge of the universe. But, the idea of turning it into a Constitutional Amendment scares the bejesus out of me. And hopefully out of a lot of other people. The definition of marriage is a frivolous issue and I don't think 75% of America will be prepared to fiddle with the Constitution on its behalf.

						   Afghanistan's Loya Jirga has crunched out a constitution, officially creating the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. I suppose it's a step in the right direction, but I can't say I have a lot of faith in the long-term success of this particular document. I found a copy of [a href="http://www.swisspeace.org/uploads/ACSF/GeneralDocuments/final%20new%20constitution.pdf"]Afghanistan's Constitution[/a] and read it a couple times.   It really is an interesting document. It struggles to achieve admirable goals considering the current infrastructural situation in Afghanistan. It attempts to find a middle ground between Islamic law and Western legal principles. It has adopted structures from European democracies and from America. I think the document is a true effort by the people of Afghanistan to form a functional democracy.   It's too bad it won't work. The most glaring problem in the document is that it is ultimately subject to Islamic law. The 3rd article says that "In Afghanistan, no law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam." Article 149 says that "The provisions of adherence to the fundamentals of the sacred religion of Islam and the regime of the Islamic Republic cannot be amended." Furthermore, only Muslims are electable as presidents. So, they have a constitution that theoretically creates a democracy but still rests upon the tenets of Islam. Sustainable?   Another problem stems from European influences. The very first section of the Afghanistan Constitution which outlines the right guaranteed to the citizens and the responsibilities of the State says that "The State shall abide by the UN charter, international treaties, international conventions that Afghanistan has signed and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights." Sounds like a recipe for European and UN meddling if you ask me. In addition, excepting elections and potential referenda, Afghanis are pretty much precluded from the operation of the government. The situation is that the people of Afghanistan are allowed certain rights, and the wise and powerful among them will take care of everything else.  Again, sounds very European to me.  Probably most problematic is the proportional elective body. In tribal Afghanistan, the warlords will not be happy taking second place to the larger ethnic groups. The Afghanis modelled the general structure of their government on the U.S. with an executive branch, a judicial branch, and a legislative branch made of two houses. The House of the People, Wolesi Jirga which is elected, has a good bit more influence than the House of Elders, or Meshrano Jirga which is a combination of 2/3 members elected by councils and 1/3 members appointed by the president. The system has checks and balances in place, but it also can clearly be abused in such a way that a given majority will be able to run roughshod over the remaining representatives.  I think the document is gravely flawed. However, I think it does show some dedication on the part of Afghanis to pursue a more cooperative and peaceful form of government. It is encouraging. Unfortunately, there are other considerations beyond the structure of their constitution.   Afghanistan is practically lawless at this point. Only the presence of international forces is keeping the lid on this pot of boiling water. Once the U.S. is finished wiping out Al'Qaeda and the Taliban our service men will leave the country and Afghanistan will most likely revert to anarchy. The central Afghan armed forces is around 10,000 strong. There are individual warlords with greater military strength. There is no mechanism available to enforce the provisions of the constitution. How can a government persist without presenting even the possibility of a threat of force?

						   Here's a pretty good  urlLink anit-blog rant . I can't really say I disagree with a lot of what this person says. Except the iMac part. I would rather use a typewriter. And I don't drink latte. What really struck me is that you could replace the blog references with magazine references and the article would still be mostly accurate. How many magazine articles can you find about saving money, saving time, or having better sex? Magazines have recycled about half a dozen ideas in a few bazillion articles but people still enjoy them. Go figure.  One other thought on what the anti-blogger had to say. The explosion of bloggers is probably a good thing in the long run. Does it not pressure companies to make sure their technology is capable of keeping up with their users? I call that a positive market influence. Regardless of how inane my blog or any other might be in content.  Actually, it kinda makes me proud to think my poor little blog has the power to fuck up the mighty Google.  Then again, my blog ranking is probably something like 600,000,000,001 in popularity.  Massachusetts of course is a big deal in the news. Goody for the gay marriage thing but a State Constitutional Convention has already been arranged. Whatever comes of the convention will be voted on in 2006. I have a suspicion (it might be more of a secret desire) that two years from now Massachusettsers (Massachusettsians?) will find that there isn't really a reason to care and will uphold the current state of affairs.  Electronic paper. Just because I think it will be the coolest thing to come down the pike since the grape leaf. I'm a shameless gadget geek and will be first in line to buy this stuff when it hits the shelves.

						   I heard an ad on the radio yesterday by the some teachers' union urging the public to support the Albertson's union and their efforts in Southern California. I've been vaguely aware of the strike for the last four months but like Arthur Dent's yellow bulldozer, the whole catastrophe didn't come together in my mind until today.   I ran across an announcement for a food drive on behalf of the strikers. This is the meat of the announcement posted on a bulletin board at UCLA:   "With their struggle to preserve affordable health care benefits stretching into its fourth month, many workers are experiencing severe financial problems and are struggling to provide their families with basic necessities. In an expression of solidarity, we are asking the UCLAW community to contribute non-perishable food items, disposable diapers of any size, jarred baby food, cereal, powdered milk, and other necessities to the workers and their families."  I can't decide whether this is gall or bleeding heart idiocy.   Why does this make me crazy you ask? (You know I'm going to tell you whether you asked or not. Isn't blogging fucking brilliant?) The U.S. economy is improving, but it's not going great guns yet. Hiring is on the increase but many people are out of work, many others are in danger of losing their jobs while the economy is still testing the water. Here you have a bunch of yahoos who actually are still employed sitting on their asses bitching about how bad they have it.  What happens if they win their strike? Grocery prices will necessarily be increased to compensate for the additional benefits. The strikers might not care much since they get a discount. But everybody else who has to buy groceries will most certainly care. Not least of which are those folks who have been unemployed for the past year and are struggling to make ends meet as it is.   The UCLAW announcement is the thing that made me start howling obscenities at my computer screen (and by extension at the strikers. I hope they heard me). If I were in the neighborhood I would take the employment section of the L.A. Times and drop it in the bin. Or maybe some community college schedules. These people wouldn't need food and necessities if they were actually working. Instead they sit and complain and chant cutsie slogans and wave their clever signs and beg for handouts because they aren't pulling in a check.  Get off your butts and go back to work. You could have spent the last four months paying for college credits or hunting for a better job (quiz: when is the best time to look for a new job? While you still have one.) or at the very least putting food on the table.  I have little appreciation for the third parties who are endorsing these bums. Unions might have (and have had) a purpose, but mostly what I see is extortive beggary. I was not taught to twist somebody's arm to better my own position. I was taught to better myself and earn a preferable position. This is America, the land of opportunity. I refuse to believe these people are incapable of improving their own lot and will give short shrift to anybody who suggests it.  I think these people provide a valuable service and would normally have nothing but esteem for them as working people. But, the bottom line is that they're grunts. Grocery Store Clerk is the kind of job I was expected to add to my resume while I was in high school. There's a reason these jobs are low paying and lacking in benefits.  These are the folks showing solidarity:  NLG (National Lawyer's Guild) WJP (Workers' Justice Project) APILSA (Asian Pacific Islander Student Association) PILF (Public Interest Law Foundation) LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender)(I may be excommunicated from the LGBT community if I'm not careful. See my thoughts on gay marriage.) La Raza (The Race an advocacy group for hispanics).  Thanks a lot guys. I can't tell you how exciting I find the prospect of buying milk at six bucks to the gallon.   I'm not a fan of unions in general. France (Come on. They are good for something.) has shown us the error of that path. I will support Albertson's by continuing to shop there during the strike. Should they buckle to these graspers, I guess I'll have to drive a couple extra miles to the local Country Square Market.

						   Sorry, I can't not post on Sunday's fiasco.  I can start at the beginning. I actually liked some of the pre-game entertainment. The tribute to Challenger was mostly well done. The fake astronaut on the fake moon was a little kitschy(sp?). Willie Nelson and the gum-chewer didn't do much for me. Beyonce was fair enough I guess but for some reason she creeps me out.   The game was good. Quality Superbowl football playing. The Panther's kicker cost them the game when he booted the ball out of bounds. Still it came down to the final nine seconds and was an exciting game.  The real topic of course is the half-time show. And the commercials actually. These were the real spectacles. And they were most dissatisfying. First, the commercials were really not that entertaining. There were only two commercials that were worth a laugh. The McDonald's wrapper in the dryer was good. The Seven-Up commercial cracked me up. The remainder were worthless. The best of the rest were boring the worst juvenile (flatulent horses and crotch-biting dogs?).   And now we come to it. The half-time show. Bottom line is it was not entertaining. P. Diddly or Piddly or whatever ridiculous appellation he's adopted for the week is just not my cup of tea. I actually have Nelly's Country Grammar album but it strikes me as being the rap (or hip-hop, I haven't determined the difference yet) equivalent to pop music. It's fun, it's great for white noise, but it has no depth (and if I had kids they would listen to the radio edit). Kid Rock is a howling screamer of second rate quality. Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson can both be superb entertainers. I'm not sure they belong in any kind of hall of fame but I won't deny that they're entertaining. Excepting Sunday's little oopsie. Janet's gender bending S&M dance routine was just bizarre. Timberlake apparently can't sing without having somebody's hand clutching his crotch (ditto for Ditty and Nelly).  Finally and inevitably, we come to the boob shot. Planned or not? I watched the spectacle, I've examined the stills, and read the disclaimers and I'm convinced it was not a mistake or even a 'wardrobe malfunction'. CBS assigned MTV the task of organizing the half-time entertainment and now are seeing the error of their ways. Juvenile toilet humor commercials aside, I don't think CBS would have allowed the stunt to happen. Of course, I don't think MTV really asked permission.  What evidence is there that this was planned? MTV promised some shocking moments during half-time and this certainly is something MTV would find entertaining. I think it's clear that the outfit was rigged because Janet's leather dominatrix outfit would not have torn so easily, nor would her bra. Besides that, what is the chance that it would have torn off in a square so precisely located and sized that only her right breast would be exposed and no bra or additional flesh? Also, Timberlake gathered the 'torn' cloth in his fist and held it at his side. Do you really think he was unaware he had something in his hand that shouldn't have been there? Maybe he thought it was his crotch. Furthermore, closeups reveal snaps on the outfit. The cup was intended to come off. MTV, Janet, and Timberlake definitely planned this. CBS probably didn't but gets to deal with the fallout.  Is this appropriate? Somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 million people tuned into the Superbowl including children. It was unequivocally, inarguably, inappropriate.  I do find it kind of remarkable that for all the brilliance and creativity of American culture, we also suffer from some of the foulest and most juvenile antics performed in the name of artistic license. That might actually be worth a blog at some point.  P.S. Was it a pastie or an elaborate piercing?  P.P.S.

						   I wrote about voting the party line. I explained some of my reasons for doing so, and am now following up with my thoughts on how this effects our two party system and what it means for those who don't vote along party lines.  One thing that's interesting and fairly unique about American political parties is that there is no party accountability. A party member votes as he sees fit regardless of party affiliation and if said member fails to uphold the party platform that's just the way it is. In many other systems the parties expect a degree of affiliation and loyalty, and have sufficient influence over the candidates to see that they vote accordingly. American parties have no such mechanism for mandating accountability. That leads to some apparently oxymoronic situations. At one point (I believe during Reagan's administration) the Republican party was home to both the most liberal and most conservative members of Congress.   In fact, it actually makes one wonder if parties actually serve a purpose. I think the answer is yes, they do serve a purpose. American parties serve a different purpose as compared to European parties, however. European parties serve to advance an agenda and a given platform. American parties serve to advance an ideology.   In many European democracies there are multi party systems. In part it is due to the voting mechanism, in part to the political structures. This has lead to a political climate where relatively minor parties can effectively gain control of political branches. Small parties can pursue fringe issues and win enough popular support to prevent larger parties from winning an outright majority or plurality as the case may be. What then happens is that the other parties will form affiliations and throw their support behind the fringe candidates. In a first-past-the-post election the major parties may not achieve the number of votes needed for a victory but if they drummed up enough support with their affiliated parties one of their fringe allies can end up with enough votes in the subsequent recount to win the election.  This type of system is attractive for some reasons but has certain problems. Smaller groups have more influence in the larger political arena and their constituents feel their voice is being heard. Unfortunately, this also means there are more arguments to be had. It also leads to some unsustainable policies and some not insignificant back-tracking. If the labor and green and socialist parties ally with one another and gain control of the government they will pursue party agendas that might be good for their constituents but at the cost of business and economic interests which is not good for the long term benefit of their constituents or their government.   America doesn't have exact parallels with European systems but we have a sort of simulated equivalent. Since we have only two parties that matter the effect of third parties is largely insignificant. In 2000 we saw what some of that influence can be. But, by and large a vote for a third party is a protest vote. Since we don't have active or powerful third parties one might think that a large portion of opinions and ideologies are ignored. That's not the case though. Our two parties must build the largest political base they can within their ideology or risk losing to the competing party. So each respective party ecompasses the entire gamut of liberalism and conservatism. Each party also has internal factions that can occasionally cause a split among the majority party members.   Our party system also has its good and bad points. One of the good things about our system is that compromise is necessary. Even if one party is in firm control of the government, internal party politics and lack of party discipline means that while we may shift between conservative and liberal directions, our general political climate will be primarily centrist. It is also helps sustain and control our experimentation in democracy. It slows change to glacial momentum. I mentioned in this post that America has become one of the last great conservative nations in the world. The bad side of our system is that many people feel disaffected because their specific agendas don't seem to be addressed. The Christian Right will always be beating their heads against a brick wall because their position is too radical to gain any real influence. Equally, socialist democrats will never be satisfied because America will resist their reforms.   So what does this have to do with not voting the party line? Well, both political parties have a broad base of constituents in nearly equal numbers who do stick to the party line. These two groups ultimately polarize American politics into two camps and when combined with the Electoral College, perpetuate the two-party system. Most of these people believe firmly in their political position and are firmly on one side of the political divide (i.e. left or right). However, there is a large minority of voters who don't fall on either side. They could be called Centrists. They vote their conscious, they vote for the prettiest speech-maker, they vote for the issue, whatever.  One thing that is important is that Centrists tend to vote for the candidate with the widest appeal at the present time. Voters firmly on a given side of the political spectrum believe that their vision is the best direction for America to go. Centrists believe the candidate they are voting for can best handle the issues of the day. It also helps explain the comparatively conservative nature of America. Centrists are middle of the road, politically. They will simply not vote for a candidate who is radical in either direction because radical political agendas will seldom corellate with their own semi-liberal/semi-conservative views.  Additionally, we see how America simulates the multi-party systems of Europe. Issues of the day will often determine who the Centrist voter will choose. If the economy is of greatest concern they will vote for the candidates with the best apparent fiscal policy. If war is the issue of the day they will vote for the candidates with the stongest foreign policy. If the environment becomes an issue of some note it will influence the Centrist. In this way, fringe issues are dealt with as they percolate into the mainstream without abandoning additional issues.  Americans are divided into four political divisions: Conservatives, Liberals, Centrists and Third Parties. Third Parties do play a part in American politics, one I would call erosive. They erode the support base for a given group as we saw in 2000, also, more spectacularly, in 1912 with Theodore Roosevelt. But they are still a tiny minority. The Liberals and Conservatives are far larger but neither have a majority. The Centrists are fewer than either Conservatives or Liberals but are a large enough portion of the voters that they ultimately elect the candidates to office by casting their votes with the votes of one of the other groups and thus accounting for a majority.  In many ways our system is dissatisfying to many people because many things they believe in are not addressed as they wish. What's important to remember though is that it's not possible to appease every opinion all the time. But I believe that because of our voter structure and because of the Centrists most opinions are appeased most of the time, to varying degrees. I think it's quite an ingenius system really.  ADDENDUM  I gave myself ideas for some future posts. While I know gerneralities about Third Parties I must plead ignorance about their specific incarnations. So, stay tuned for assessments regarding the Third Parties. Such as they are.

						   User musicalhair started me thinking about this because of his post regarding my blurb on evolution and the folks in Tennessee. For a while, people were saying that political parties in America are kind of a joke, that the differences between them are negligible. Obviously people aren't saying that anymore. The two major political parties here are polarized.   I often hear people say they don't vote for a party, they vote for a candidate, or they vote for an issue. I think that's a pretty poor way to participate in American politics. The American economic/political/social system is massive and its inertia is similarly enormous. I think our system is best viewed as a big picture. Voting on the candidate or the issue fails to consider the big picture.  There are a couple of pitfalls I can see happening by voters casting their ballot for their candidate or their issue(s). I seem to remember reading something that said most voters actually vote according to their views of certain core issues like abortion or gun control or social welfare. While I'm not arguing that this is an invalid way to cast one's ballot, I do feel that these voters are potentially ignoring other issues which can hardly be ignored.   People who say they vote for candidates make me think they're more interested in popularity or 'electability' than the political process. I can't entirely discount their choosing process either because the candidates' personalities and characters are undeniably important since they must be diplomats and negotiators as well as leaders. However, these characteristics are only a part of the package.  I vote the party line (Republican) because on average I agree with more of their policies and agendas than I do with the Democrats. I certainly don't agree with all of their ideologies. I'm something of an oxymoron really. A gay atheist Republican living in the San Francisco Bay Area? The thing is, I believe in the legislative process above the judicial process. I believe in the Constitution. I believe in populism. In short, I believe in the American people.  In a previous post I endorsed evolution. Fair enough, but Republicans or conservatives are often equalled with religion, specifically Christianity. How can I be both? I can't. And I'm not. For one thing, evolution continues regardless of belief. Darwin's engine doesn't stop chugging because people don't learn about it. Should I have the good fortune of raising a child he will learn about religions and about evolution and he will be allowed to decide what he believes for himself.   There's a deeper issue here beyond the validity of evolution vs. religion. That is the separation of church and state. I absolutely believe in said separation. Something to consider here though is that America is overwhelmingly Christian. Separation between church and state doesn't mean that the candidates in office can't have some kind of belief. All it means is that no church can be promoted as superior and no church can have influence in the government as a political entity. That being said, I mentioned that America is an overwhelmingly Christian nation. Even Bill Clinton carried a Bible around with him everywhere he went. For the foreseeable future American politics will be colored by the Christian ethic simply by virtue of demographics. That doesn't mean that followers of other religions will be mistreated or invalidated, only that they are outnumbered by Christians. I don't know if it's a bad thing or not, nor do I care. I believe in science, in fact, and in result. As long as there are results I approve of I don't care about the motivation, be it Christian or otherwise.  I've also endorsed gay marriage after a fashion. It does apply directly to me. The general idea seems to be that gay marriage is anathema to the Republican Party. However, my feeling is that it would be best to pursue legislative action rather than judicial action. I would rather see people accept gay marriage voluntarily than have it foisted on them by judges. It would certainly be better for gays.   Public education? I think it is in America's best interest to see that it has a well-educated population. I don't think a publicly funded school system is the way to achieve that. In fact, what we have now may be the next best thing to an abject failure. I think education should be privatized, moderately regulated and parents receive tuition assistance based on income, number of children, etc.  Welfare? Sure, I think people ought to be given a hand when they are in need, but I don't trust people who don't make their own way. Welfare needs to be strictly limited to people who are not capable of independent living and strictly limited to temporary benefits in terms of unemployment. It's not a matter of compassion. It's a matter of reality. I simply don't trust people who aren't earning their own way. And if I am earning my own way I want the option of deciding whether and who I get to help out. We all go through hard times, but when push comes to shove there are possibilities. Unemployed? Flip burgers or stuff envelopes or mow lawns until you can find something better.  These examples demonstrate the direction I would like to see America go. It's more likely that the Republicans will move in this direction than the Democrats and that's why I vote the party line. Sure there might be Democrats who would push for school vouchers or welfare reform, but if I vote for them based those issues I'm forgoing the others. In fact, I'm potentially reversing things I appreciate that have already been accomplished.  This is turning out to be a fascinating topic in my own mind, so I think I'll try to follow it up with some thoughts on the middle of the road voters. Especially since they're generally the ones who actually end up electing the candidates.

						   Washington Post Link.  Free subscription required.  Folks have been saying what Cosby said to the NAACP for some time.  Since they mostly weren't black it was racist.  But, Cosby is a respected member of the black community and while it wasn't very popular, it certainly couldn't qualify as racism.  I can't resist commenting on the double standard, even though it isn't the meat of this post.  Liberals would lose their fucking minds if a white guy said poor blacks aren't holding up their end of the deal.  When Cosby says it, he speaks the truth.  Hmm.  Anyhow, it is truth, and it's a truth that people have resisted recognizing for some time.  Statistics show that the middle and upper class is the fastest growing segment of the black community.  The lower class segment remains static.  It is not decreasing.  My experience working with social services explains why this is so.  There are attitudes and behaviors reinforced among these people keeping them where they are.  Some of the reinforcement has become systemic.  But that is not the root of the problem.    There was recently a series of newspaper articles about the state of education in Contra Costa County.  It found (shockingly) that schools in more affluent neighborhoods are better because the parents and the communities are more engaged in the schools and their activities.  People donate money and time to the schools and maintain an investment in their local schools.  Schools in poor neighborhoods do less well because noboby is engaged in the improvement of the school, the community, or the students.  Often these poor neighborhoods have a fairly high proportion of blacks.  I don't think it's coincidental.  Nor do I think it's a conspiracy.  Schools in poor neighborhoods and elsewhere are built more or less identically.  They are not built with grafiti on the walls or shattered windows or broken toilets.  Yet this is what these schools end up with.  Schools in Richmond have all of the above.  Schools in Danville do not.  Why should this be so?  Because the residents and the students in poorer neighborhoods don't take care of what they have.  They may not be able to afford to donate money to their school, but they can donate time and care.  Unfortunately, it seems they don't care to donate anything.  Instead of pushing their kids to go to school, to study their books, to learn proper English, to use what they do have, they complain about how bad things are.  I have to say my hat is off to Bill Cosby for pointing out the elephant.

						   Let's all apologize one more time.  Bill Clinton was famous for this.  He apologized for everything.  Everybody knows a great big "I'm sorry" solves everything.  Here's how I see this apology thing.  "Europeans crossed the big pond, killed a whole big bunch of your folks, ran you off your land, introduced you to the magic of whiskey, and largely destroyed your native cultures.  So, hey, we're all real sorry that happened."  In short, this apology accomplishes nothing.  It's an enormous waste of time.  It's even a little insulting.  One of the articles in the bill is:  "[The United States, acting through Congress] apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by citizens of the United States."  I have a problem with this.  Mainly because even though I'm a 'people of the United States' I ain't sorry.  Furthermore, I've never inflicted an instance of violence, maltreatment, or neglect on Native People.  Thus, not only am I not sorry, I have no cause to be sorry.    I can't say I think what happened was right, but it happened and what's done is done.  It's a little late to undo it.    This is a great place for a historical/multi-cultural context.  Waging devasting wars against people is a human tendency, not unique to the 'white man'.  Many many cultures have been destroyed.  Those with poorer technology or skills were easy pickings and were shattered, absorbed, and their culture erased from the march of time.  The Golden Horde was violent and vicious in their conquest of the known world.  In fact, they are attributed with inventing biological warfare.  During their seiges, they would launch corpses of plague victims into the cities and wait for the people to die off.  The Mongols introduced the plague to Europe (more or less purposely), and followed up with brutal physical violence that has rarely been matched by any other conquering power.  Their violence was so famous that their battles were half won before they engaged the enemy.  I don't know that they wiped out entire cultures, but I do know if they failed it wasn't for lack of zeal.  When Europeans found the Aztecs, they were already at the mercy of invaders.  The invaders used ritual human sacrifice (injudiciously) to cow their new subjects.  More recently we've seen attempted genocide in two parts of Africa (Rwanda and Sudan) and in Europe.  This isn't necessarily a defense, but it does serve to illustrate that this mentality is a consequence of human nature.  People (cultures) are subject to evolution.  Those who are incapable of defending themselves and their culture will fade into oblivion.  The reason does not matter.  The Native Americans had no defenses against the diseases introduced by Europeans.  They did not have equivalent technology.  Some of them were disadvantaged by their spirituality.  Europeans exploited the Indian's weaknesses for their own gain.  As has happened time after time throughout history.  As continues to happen today.  People seldom treat one another fairly.  They treat one another in such a way as to gain advantage.    We do not live in a world where all cultures are equal.  If that were the case, Egyptians would be building pyramids, Phoenicians would be sailing the Mediterranean, Sumerians would be pounding squiggles into chunks of clay, the Incas would be paving their streets with gold, Hawaiians would have a monarch.  These culture failed for various reasons, many of them because of violence and brutality.  Regardless, they were unable to protect their culture and are relegated to historical curiosity.  Native American cultures will eventually disappear also.  There are too few of them, and they will not be able to survive in their crystal spheres with or without casinos.  Over time, fewer of the youngsters will be satisfied with entitlements and will integrate into the general American population.  The last vestiges of their societies are fading, native languages are disappearing, traditions are being lost.    Welcome to a non-static reality.

						    urlLink Yesterday's theme  sparked my imagination.  I'm not a scientist or an engineer by training, but science is a hobby of mine, and I have a general understanding of the technology and problems faced by folk wanting to go to space.  So, since I only know enough to prove my ignorance (and possibly be dangerous in the right situation "Ohhh, look, red button!  Must push button!"), I'm going to engage in wild speculation and create my own fantasy version of the budding space industry.  I suspect the first revenue streams will come from cargo transport, tourism, and research.  Carrying cargo like satellites and food stuffs for space station inhabitants will be a preferable alternative.  At first, tourism will probably amount to a really fucking expensive carnival ride.  People will effectively be paying a few (tens of?) million bucks to spend a couple of days on a rocket ship.  Research organizations will pay to have experiments taken to space where they can be conducted without some of the problems found at the bottom of a gravity well.  As the technology matures and kinks are ironed out there will be some additional revenue streams.  One, I think, will be orbital satellite servicing.  Satellites only last about five to seven years.  Hubble was the first satellite to be successfully serviced in orbit.  Had the Hubble not been able to be serviced in orbit it would have been a disastrous (and expensive) failure.  Obviously it is preferable to have modular, serviceable satellites that can be fixed than ones that have to be scratched.  It can be compared to getting a new car everytime you need an oil change.  Satellites are built more robustly than that, but still a satellite is an expensive bit of gadgetry, and orbital servicing would add some guarantee of longevity.  I think companies would pay well for that service (and still pay less than they would if they had to rebuild and relaunch).  Actually, I want my next job to be an orbital satellite technician.  If you know of any openings, please let me know.  The next step in the industrialization of space is orbital manufacturing, long-term research facilities, and tourist facilities (Orbital Spa and Resort type facilities).  The real horse-choking hairball problems show up here.  Factories and research labs and hotels require things like air and water and walls.  Lots of all of them.  Coming up with those things is problematic.  Hauling all that stuff up from the Earth is a horse-choking hairball problem by itself.  Taping it all together is another.  Building an orbital factory will not be a matter of fitting nipple A into Slot B and tightening the universal flangelator.  I think that the best way of building the foundation for an orbital infrastructure would be to build modules here on the ground and launch these fully functional modules into space where they could be stuck together ticky-tack style.  Launching the components for a module and then constructing them in space seems inefficient when a fully functional module could be up and running as soon as it is bolted onto the larger structure.  These modules would necessarily be smallish and limited in their productive abilities, but they could also be dedicated to expanding the orbital structure.  The factories would be better used to build additional facilities and such than being used to build things for use on Earth.    Coming up with raw materials is problematic (though not horse-chokingly so).  Bringing raw materials up from Earth is pretty much out of the question.  I think there are better sources of raw materials.  Near Earth Asteroids and the Moon have loads of raw materials that can be harvested.  (Not easily, but I'm making the rules.)  Besides when I'm bored with being the satellite plumber, I want to be an asteroid miner ("There's  gold  in them thar hills!").  That's it in a nutshell.  Stay tuned, though.  I'll be considering other. . . considerations later.

						   The airport in Mojave will soon be the world's first privately held Space Port.  It is expected that the X-Prize will be claimed this year (as early as this summer).  It's already been demonstrated that folks are willing to pony up a chunk of change for a ride on a spaceship.    I think we are seeing the dawn of the space age.  Or maybe the mid-morning of the space age since it can be argued that the space age dawned about half a century ago.  What we are inarguably seeing is the commercialization of the space industry.  Satellites and satellite launching technologies have been successfully commercialized already.  There are scores of privately owned satellites floating around our little hunk of dirt.  Several companies offer launching facilities.  A number of competitors are trying to build reusable space craft.  Even NASA is getting into the spirit of things with their  urlLink Challenges Workshop .  NASA paved the way and proved the possibility of space travel.  Now, they are losing relevance.  Market forces and independent research and development will eventually stomp NASA.  A bureaucracy like NASA can't compete with the rapidity of free-market competitors. NASA was necessary to get the ball rolling because of the sheer scale of the proposal.  At the time, there were no corporations or individuals with the resources to research the technology.  The government did have the resources (and did a brilliant job, all things considered).  Now, corporations have enough wealth to begin exploring the space industry.  The technology is mostly well-understood and is freely available.  Sitting here at my desk I could hunt down all the suppliers and information I would need to begin building my own space craft.  Funding is a different matter, but it is hardly impossible to find.  A full dozen participants have entered the X Prize (and I'm quite certain each of them has spent far more than the $10 million prize money).  There are even more privately funded groups who will be participating in the X Cup.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on developing this technology privately, and there is every reason to believe that money will continue to be spent at this rate if not more rapidly as the technologies develop and begin to prove lucrative.  Many people decry the effort as a waste of time, energy, and money.  One of their main arguments is that the amount of money involved is to great to permit any kind of profitable return.  There are limited sources of profitability in space.  They are (potentially) tourism, research, industry, energy production, and materials harvesting.  There are many things that must be in place to support these activities.  There must be a means of purifying air and water, and a reliable supply of food.  Additionally, there is a staggering energy cost, one must factor in the cost of support personnel on the ground and in space, the capital expenditure needs to be recouped. . .  It's unquestionably an expensive proposal.  It's all well and good to crunch dollars and explain how that makes the whole catastrophe a pipe dream.  But I think that's backwards thinking.  Dollars don't necessarily drive us to explore space.  Something more fundamental is at work here.  Simple curiosity, the need to explore, is driving the X Prize competition and the space industry.  For the near future the prospect of significant financial returns is vanishingly small.  The $10 million X Prize will be nothing compared to what has been spent on building the winning vessel.  I submit that the competitors are not competing for the prize.  They are competing for the 'first'.  They want to earn themselves a place in history more than they want the big check.  Furthermore, they want to explore.  People  know  it is possible to leave our little hunk of dirt and see what's on the other side.  We've been captivated by the very idea of leaving the earth at least since Jules Verne took us to the moon.  The NASA missions fueled that fire more than ever.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm the bear climbing the mountain to see what he can see.  If it's another mountain I want to climb that one too.  And that's what makes the X Prizers compete.  They want to see what's on the other side of the mountain.  We are now living in an era when there is sufficient wealth and knowledge to make the dream of exploring the worlds beyond our own a possibility.  I wrote a blurb about Space Agencies outside of the U.S. arguing that they ought to be invited to work with NASA.  They said that the only way to develop space would be a concerted multi-lateral effort.  I think they are just trying to get a piece of the pie.  But again, they fail to see how free markets work and the power of capitalism.  Bureaucracies are good at some things, but making money is not one of them.  Leveraging technology is something else they are poor at doing.  Private organizations are good at both of those things because they can change and adapt more rapidly to changing conditions and emerging trends.  The United States is about to unleash the power of its economy and business on the space industry.  As things stand right now, the space agencies around the world are specks in NASA's rearview.  Once we open the industry to commerce, they will no longer be visible.    Of the 12 X Prize participants, seven of them are American.  One is Romanian (who woulda thought?), one is Argentinian (ditto), one is British, and two are Canadian.  I think this is not insignificant.  Americans have the will to pursue this technology and the wealth to fund it.  Maybe I'm a hopeless optimist, but I think Americans also have the ingenuity to make it work.  It may take years, but if anybody can make space a lucrative place, it's Americans.  People are quick to point out the hurdles facing the space industry.  But, I think recognizing a problem is the first step in solving it.  I also think that we don't really have a grasp of the potential benefits and revenue streams that will come of a healthy space infrastructure.  Everybody who points out problems we face, does so in the context of modern technology.  The technology will not remain stagnant.  It will advance (that is, in a way, the very essence of the X Prize).  We have a fair grasp of the physical principles involved, but we haven't yet developed a lot of those principles to sufficient maturity to know how they will affect our advancement.  I think the naysayers are important, but in this case I'm an optimist.  Maybe because I would like nothing better than a ride on a rocket ship.  In any case, I fully expect to see a healthy and growing space industry emerge before I die.

						   I watched President Bush deliver his speech last night at the Army College.  I think it was well done.  Actually, I think it was extremely well done, considering Bush's speech giving skill.  He's no Odysseus.  Most of the speech regarded the pending transfer of authority in Iraq.  He did make mention of some of the recent situations (Al Sadr and Abu Garabi?  Abu Ghrumam?  The prison place).  He also said that the problems are being dealt with.  Enough said.  The speech didn't give a whole lot of substantive detail regarding the process, but it did give the general shape of what is planned.  Actually, this plan has been around for some time.  He didn't break out a bunch of details but he did break the plan down (Post-War Iraq in Five Easy Steps).  One thing he did was make a big deal out of the progress that has been made so far.  President Bush spoke about the rebuilding of schools, roads, bridges, restored oil production, and training of teachers and security forces.    I think the speech was really the beginning of his re-election campaign.  He's going to start clearing up some things about Iraq and pushing the interim government.  After June 30th and the transfer of power he should have some breathing room to tout the economy and shore up his voter base.

						   I keep a saltwater aquarium.  It's a fascinating hobby.  It's a great opportunity to learn of many things.  Chemistry, natural history, even some physical and math principles.  Anyhow, I have a 40 gallon tank with a snowflake moray.  He's a  urlLink handsome devil .  And about as smart as you can expect an eating machine to be.  Unfortunately, I'm only able to keep him in the tank.  He's big enough to eat just about anything else I might like to keep.  He even ate a Picasso Trigger that was *supposed* to be able to fight back.  I probably could keep a lion fish with him, but I'm afraid he might get stung during feeding.  He goes apeshit when he smells food in the tank.    It's all good though.  Eels are my favorite fish.  I've spent many hours, mesmerized by his beautiful aquabatics.  Eels are usually nocturnal and quite shy by saltwater fish standards.  Snowflake eels are a friendly bunch though.  Mine certainly likes to show off by swimming through cracks and crevices in the rockwork, and cutting shapes in the water.  He's not only handsome and outgoing, he's a fascinating creature.  Eels are fish.  People compare them to snakes, but they are fish with gills and fins and all things fishiness entails.  Eels are unique fish though.  They have long bodies and one continuous dorsal/anal fin they use to locomote.  They also have rudimentary lungs and can survive out of water for some time.  Mine last eel was a real hanger on.  He escaped from the tank while I was away on a long weekend.  I found him under the tank stand.  I was going to write him off as marine jerky when he opened his mouth to gasp for air.  I nearly bounced him off the nearest wall.  I dropped him back in the tank and, unbelievably, he came around.  What happens is they excrete a slime coat that helps keep them from drying out.  They can breathe out of the water and will survive as long as they don't dry completely.  In nature they hang out around coral rubble where there are lots of nooks and crannies, so I put rock work in my tank to approximate his natural surroundings.  He finds crevices and crawly spaces I couldn't even see.    They are also quite smart and very determined.  You practically need to seal the tank with thermal bond epoxy to keep them in.  If there is a crack in your tank's defenses, they will exploit it.  They are naturally curious animals and they also have a powerful extinct to return to the place from which they came.  If their wiles don't work in getting them out of the tank they will resort to brute force.  Before settling in, my eel would wait for feeding time.  Instead of going for the meal he would launch himself at the opening (and my face).  He never escaped using that tactic but he did send me fleeing to the opposite corner of the room on occassion.    For the aquarists out there, here is my setup:  40 gallon glass tank Reverse flow undergravel filter Millenium Power Filter (on the back type) Bak-Pak Skimmer 25 Lbs. live rock SG:  1.025 (He prefers a slightly high SG) Temp:  77 F ~0 ppm Nitrite ~5 ppm Nitrate ~0 ppm Ammonia

						   Liberals in the media and elsewhere pooh-pooh the finding of the Sarin shell in Iraq.  Predictably, now that we are finding WMDs, the Left changes the rules by making up their own definition of WMD.  So, we find a functional (though not perfectly) sarin gas shell (which was a WMD until it was found), and the Left says well, it's standard battlefield weaponry.  No biggie, nothing to see here folks.  No matter what we find, the Left will continue to raise the bar until only the destructive power equivalent to a multi-billion ton asteroid crashing into the Earth will qualify.  I don't think the construction of any given weapon qualifies it as a WMD.  I think it is the intent that makes it a WMD (except Nukes).  Passenger airplanes are not normally considered to be weapons of mass destruction (hell they're not normally weapons of any sort).  But, when they are crashed into buildings, cause billions of dollars of damage, and cost 3,000 lives, they are unquestionably WMDs.  An M-16 is not normally considered a weapon of mass destruction but if one were to open fire in the Fremont Street Experience during the New Year Celebration, I would place it in the WMD category.  Given their record, I think it's pretty clear that Islamic fundamentalists have every intent of maximizing any weapon in their possession when directing its destructive power against their perceived enemies.  There is little doubt that if they had a means of doing so they would use Sarin gas or VX or any other agent in their possession against U.S. civilians indiscriminately.  I can only describe the Left's hair splitting as moronic.  We're talking about people who can imagine using airplanes as torpedoes against civilian.  How can anybody believe these same people would hesitate to use real-life, honest-to-God(s(ess(es))), battlefield weaponry similarly?

						   An interesting theme emerged yesterday in the news.  The title link on this page is to the EU Observer.  Additionally, there was a talk radio guest who discussed the EU economic situation.  I discussed it a little bit  urlLink here .  I think the compound problems that have become apparent in the EU's attempted economy are accelerating the collapse.  I think it is clear that the EU is approaching critical mass.  What it all boils down do is that there is far too much regulation.  European nations are strangling their own economic zone.  It's worked out so far because they haven't needed to spend much on the military (the U.S. foots that bill for them), and because their populations haven't grown very rapidly.  Now, they're running into some serious problems.  They're approaching the point where there are about as many people living on entitlements as their are tax payers.  They are not replacing retirees with new workers.  Furthermore, the tax burdens and union burdens on their economies stifles any kind of growth.  France, for example, has netted zero new jobs in the last decade (possibly longer, I can't find the stat anymore).  Most of this has been pretty well hashed out (by folks with a lick of sense at least), but it seems that, finally, Europe is going to have to face the facts.

						   I don't get this apology thing.  I grew up understanding that when I do something wrong I should apologize for my wrongdoing.  I also understood that an aopolgy by somebody for something for which they were not responsible is not worth a hill of beans.  So, what is accomplished when the Swiss President apologizes to the Russian president for an aircraft collision (two years past).  Well, who am I to question such things?  I'll just join in.  I hereby declare May 20th to be Apology Day.  As one gives thanks on Thanksgiving, so too shall one give apology on Apology day.  1.  I'm sorry for two-headed calves. 2.  I'm sorry for poodles with stupid hair-dos. 3.  I'm sorry for women who have ugly babies.

						   I'm watching the Boogiepop Phantom anime series for the third time.  I'll probably be watching it a number of times in the future.  It has so many layers and threads that you have to watch it carefully and (in my case) many times.  I'm writing this partly to help myself clear up the sequence of events both in the overall story and in the stories of the characters.  When I start discussing specifics I'll give a warning so you can skip it.  Boogiepop covers a series of events in a city in Japan.  I don't think they ever give the name of the city.  All I know is it's not Tokyo.  Anyhow, each episode gives additional details of the overall story.  The twist is that each episode is done from the perspective of a different character.  Not only does the series tell an inclusive story, it tells individual stories about the various characters.  Another twist to the series of events is that the series is not in chronological order.  In fact, a number of the episodes are in reverse chronological order, most of them have a now and then chronology with flashbacks to moments in the past, and most of them don't start or end over the same period of time.  This is why you have to pay attention when watching.  You have to catch clues that tell when the scene is taking place.  The main story begins five years ago.  The story-telling begins a month ago with a bright light spearing the sky.  The light is important because it is a marker that helps clear up the confusing sequence of events.  In each episode (some more than others) comments and flashbacks give information on the events of the previous five years.  The events of the previous five years lead up to the light appearing in the sky and the weirdness that follows.  The soundtrack is also clueful(?!).  Certain sound effects and music indicate important things about the timeline and the characters.    ***Beginning of potential spoiler section.  I don't think I have it all right yet so some of what I put here might be incorrect.***  Here's where things get foggy.  The background information is sprinkled throughout the series.  What I've figured out so far is that humans are evolving (X-Men style).  There is an organization called Towa that is resisting this evolutionary process.  Their goal seems to be (eventually) to enslave the general population for their service.  Their means of controlling evolution is to create artificially evolved humans called composite humans and sick 'em on evolved humans.  That's it in a broad stroke.  The anchor to everything is the beam of light.  Everything that happens is related to the beam of light and it provides the time frame.  Everything happens before or after the beam of light.  The events immediately surrounding the beam of light are only revealed through flashbacks and it's hard to reconstruct them.  What seems to happen is that there is a battle of sorts involving Saotome (who has some kind of relationship with the Manticore, the Manticore (who assumes Saotome's form), Detective (or Agent maybe? or a super-evolved human called Echos?), Boogiepop (who is not Boogiepop Phantom), and Nagi Kirima (who is following in her father's footsteps and may be hunting for his killer).  Detective dies.  Saotome dies, Manticore is defeated.  Dead detective becomes reporter.  Wait.  Detective was already dead.  Detective had been killed five years previously by Evil Doctor who was the serial killer of five years ago.  Unless the Manticore escaped around then.  It's a puzzle.  Boogiepop (and her alterego) lived but Boogiepop Phantom emerged from the mess also.  Nagi lived (she was hunting for her father's killer).  Nagi and Boogiepop seemed to have an understanding although Nagi seems to think Boogiepop might have something to do with Towa (the Evil Organization).  Echos is the source of the light (Or the Manticore is.  They both seem to be made of energy).    That's the simplified plot.  What about the characters?  The Manticore is a composite human who looked like some woman but now looks like Saotome.  Saotome was Saotome until he became the Manticore.  Moto loved Saotome until Boogiepop crushed her crush.  Boogiepop is Boogiepop but she's also Toka although neither of them are Boogiepop Phantom.  Nagi is Nagi.  Detective is detective except he might actually be a composite human Towa agent.  Detective stops being detective after Evil Doctor kills him but is brought back from the dead by or as Echos.  None of the above are Reporter although Reporter is eventually Manticore.  Yoji is Manticore/Saotome's slave until he goes insane.  Panaru is unknown.  Two girls are also called Panaru, one is Panaru like, the other is Fake Panaru.  Fake Panaru pays for being fake when Morita (who is actually Fake Morita; really he's Snake Eye)tears her apart and shoots her twice.  Manaka is a little girl but she dies (strangled by her grandmother) and is reanimated by Echos.  She's also Poom Poom (or at least the source of Poom Poom who is not imaginary but who is not entirely real).    Okay.  My head's starting to explode so that will have to do for now until I finish watching again.

						   Gay marriage became officially legal in Massachusetts on Monday.  I am all for same sex marriage.  But I have a problem with Conservatives arguing that the judges in Massachusetts are "Shredding the Constitution."  I'm not what you might call a Constitutional scholar, but my understanding is that rights and duties not specifically given to the federal and state governments respectively are reserved for the people.  Civil laws (the things dealing with marriage contracts and the like) are specifically due to the states.  The Federal Government has the right to determine how the individual state civil laws relate to other states, but does not (at this time) have the right to determine what those laws can be.  That's what the Protection of Marriage Act is all about.  It only says that homosexual civil unions performed in a given state do not have to be recognized as legally binding in other states.  I read the Massachusetts State Constitution (at least thoroughly skimmed it) and read the judicial ruling that brought Massachusetts to the present situation.  I didn't find anything in the State Constitution that defines marriage.  All I found was that the state had the right to determine what officials had the authority to perform marriages.  The State Supreme Court determined that because there was no legal definition of marriage it can not be restricted only to heterosexual couples.  The marriage contract is between two persons.  The Federal Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by saying that the issue is up to the state of Massachusetts.  I think law is a matter of hair splitting.  This is a fine example.  The people of Massachusetts can amend their State Constitution so that marriage is defined as a civil union between a man and a woman.  Until that happens marriage is a civil union between two consenting persons.

						   If you're reading this, welcome.  And thank you.  My previous post was just a trial to see what I thought of blogspot.  I have one question.  Is there a hit counter?  If not, can somebody point me to a code for one that I can add to my front page?  I ask for purely self-serving reasons.  Seeing the numbers get bigger feeds my ego.  Anyhow, I've been over at Tblog but it's making me crazy.  It's pathetically slow and goes down often enough that it's not worth my time to stay there.  I like their set up and I like the community at Tblog but blogging is no fun when you can't actually blog (or check your stats).  For this first *official* post, I'm going to bring you up to speed on me.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It may well be the most liberal place in the country (Berkeley.  Need I say more?).  As a conservative (a rootin' tootin' party-line votin' partisan Republican) from Wyoming (I bet you didn't see that coming), I am a little out-numbered.  I'm actually a political soap-opera.  I'm not only a conservative in the Bay Area, I'm a gay one (single I might add), and an atheist to boot.  Now, I wouldn't say I'm unreasonable but I  am  always right.  My duty to the world is to enlighten the masses with my wisdom.  Okay, okay so I'm not always right but I'm  never  wrong (welcome to my universe).  Practically everything I write about is political/current events related.  I think the whole catastrophe is fascinating.  My intention at this point is to copy my Tblog posts here on my blogspot over the next few months or weeks.  I will probably try to do double posts, mirroring what I put here on Tblog until everything matches and then I will kill my poor little Tblog.  Later today I will blog of great import, and hopefully (it hasn't worked yet today) I will also be able to copy some of my Tblog material.  Sincerely,

						    What beheading apologists are you referring to? This is just a red herring invented by conservatives as the only defense to our own abuses.  You are absolutely right when you say beheading is inexcusable if we did it, as it is inexcusable by anyone. Similarly, it would be wrong for the terrorists to humiliate our soldiers, deprive them of food and sleep, beat them, leave them tied up for hours outside on the desert ground, and other such abuses.  The only moral relativists I see in this mess are conservatives trying to defend this indefensible war. Wrong is wrong, no matter who the perpetrator is.   Curious thought.  It brings to mind the question "Is it wrong for a man to steal bread for his hungry children?"  Yes, it's wrong because stealing is wrong and as 'Anonymous' says wrong is wrong no matter the perpetrator.  However, most people are not monsters and would say it is acceptable for a man to steal food for his hungry children, myself included.  Consider it the benefit of the doubt defense.  It's probable that the man is  only  stealing bread because they're hungry and he has no alternative.  In a different situation, it's likely that he would never steal bread.  The bread man is a staple of moral discussion.  I'm not really sure how it relates to Abu Ghraib vs. the Beheaders, but consider:  It's at least marginally acceptable to many people that the breadman steal food for his kids.  Was the breadman childless and not hungry it would be completely unacceptable.  So, what changes our assessment?  Are we "Thinking of the children"?  I don't think so, at least not directly.  If the man steals bread for his kids he's taking risk on behalf of others.  Immoral actions done for a noble cause is pallatable.  Thus, motivation serves as a measure of morality.  Stealing for one's own gain is disgraceful.  Stealing for a second party's necessity is (or can be) acceptable.  It's marginally okay for the breadman to steal bread for his kids.  What if he robs a bank at gunpoint, with the intent of spending the money on bread for the little tykes?  I would feel sympathy for him but not to the extent of agreeing that he should be let off.  At that point the man ought to be prosecuted.  What is different here?  The extent of the moral infraction.  Theft is the immoral behavior.  Swiping bread from the grocery store is wrong, but nobody is endangered, and the loss is on the order of pennies.  Robbing a bank at gunpoint puts many people at risk, and is measured in hundreds or thousands of dollars.  Thus, magnitude is important in determining the morality of actions.  Combining these two ideas gives us moral judgement.  Lying is a moral infraction (I hate lying and very seldom do it).  Social lies are generally acceptable (I'm not good at these.  "Does this shirt make me look fat?"  "Yeah.  Ow! Stop hitting me!")  Lying to spare somebody's feelings is often excused.  I tend not to do this either, but feelings and I don't talk often.  Lying for personal gain is generally reprehensible.  Furthermore, the response to moral infractions is important to determining the moral fiber of a person or people.    Abu Ghraib was shameful.  It was wrong.  It was inexcusable, and never once have I seen a conservative blogger make excuses.  America was appalled.  We expect excellence from our people and this was most certainly not excellence.  We are still in the process of punishing those who were guilty of this atrocity.  We responded by holding the guilty parties accountable to a standard of behavior.  We trotted them out in front of everybody and made them take responsibility and face their shame.  It doesn't make it right but it hopefully helps us move towards a world where it will not happen again.  At least not at our hands.  Beheading civilians is shameful and wrong and inexcusable.  In America it would be considered a monstrosity only explainable by insanity.  We would be collectively horrified if a farmer in the midwest showed up on the news beheading some stranger, some passerby.  It is almost blase in the Islamic world.  Some of them are chagrined and ashamed and horrified, but no small number of them dance in the streets and cheer for these monsters.  They clearly have a different moral scale than we have as Americans.    Conservatives, including myself, use an absolute moral scale.  Moral infractions are measured on a 'wrongness' scale.  Liberals use a relative moral scale and wrongness is measured on a perpetrator scale.  America is supposed to be better than fundamentalists so lesser transgressions perpetrated by Americans are equivalent to greater transgressions perpetrated by others.  I'll close with this:  Were you captured by an enemy and given a choice would you pick humiliation or beheading?  I know I can live with wounded pride and a few bruises.  I'm not so sure I would long survive without my head.

						   Islamic fundamentalists have beheaded Paul Marshall. In all probability a video will soon be circulated. We'll soon hear the worthless two-bit apologists making excuses for what would be inexcusable if it was our doing. Welcome to the world of moral relativity where the malleability of truth is plotted asymptotically.  For the life of me I can't fathom how anybody could try to rationalize this monstrosity. I don't care to try fathoming it either. I have nothing but contempt for anybody who thinks slaughtering an innocent man, a civilian engineer, is fair play.   We're the evil ones, they say. We shouldn't be there in the first place, they say.  Why not? Who will hold these people responsible for what they do? Europe? Themselves? Allah? Please. Europe is overflowing with apologists. Arabs might publicly excoriate the actions of these fundamentalists, but their actions don't reflect their words. And their god?   "Allah revealed His will to the angels, saying: 'I shall be with you. Give courage to the believers. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads, maim them in every limb!'" Sura 8:12   In short, their god invites them to behave monstrously.   I called it a sickness before and I stand by that. It festers in their heart and drives them to madness. They are like rabid dogs and like rabid dogs these fundamentalists should be killed.

						   I saw the Chronicles of Riddick Sunday.  It wasn't entirely a waste.  There was a lot of action and gadgetry.  The shallow side of me loved all the big nasty looking weapons and the eye candy.  The critical spiteful side of me wanted a refund.  The story was choppy at best.  At least, what story there was.  And I can't for the life of me imagine why anybody would pay Vin Diesel to act.  He's horrible.    I give it many kudos for special effects.  The camera work irritated me.  The action was good.  The actors were mostly horrible.  The story was tantilizing but horribly inadequate.  But, I'm shallow enough to give it a positive neutral rating for the eye candy alone.  The other movie I watched was Van Helsing.  I liked it much better.  It was very fun with lots of eye candy and action.  There were some cleverly done camera tricks and I loved the soundtrack.  Van Helsing's accent came and went.  That always bugs me a little bit.  The humor was second rate one-liners.  But the action was excellent, and the weapons equally so.  I can't claim Hugh Jackman is much of an actor either, but he at least strikes me as being likable.  Van Helsing gets an outright positive positive.  Curiously, and wholly unrelated, Babylon 5 Season 5 DVD collection is the #8 bestseller on Yahoo Shopping.

						   I've not seen much of interest in the political/current events arena lately.  But here are a few interesting items.   Under God    urlLink Michael Newdow  lost his case in the Supreme Court.  Under God will remain in the pledge of allegience.  I put this in the ignorant waste of time category.  Seperation of church and state only means that no church can carry political influence in our governments.  Since our government is made up of people and people tend to have religious beliefs that color their actions, I don't think it is realistic to believe that every religious reference can be excised from our government.  Under God in the pledge of allegiance is harmless, as is 'in God we trust' on our money, as is the patriotic song, God Bless America.  I think it's more of an historical trapping than anything, it's America's version of invoking God on our behalf.     France Unions    urlLink French utility workers  initiated targeted blackouts against members of the government to protest a move towards privitization.  I'm no economist but I have to think that France is headed towards a meltdown.  25% of France's labor force is employed in the public sector.  10% is unemployed.  That means 65% of their labor force has to pay enough taxes to cover entitlements and so on.  Combined with economic strangulation, I don't see how they can last much longer.  The fact that the government is desperately trying to solve the budget problem and is being blocked at every step by unions, compounds the problem.    Kerry's Message    urlLink Senator Kerry says  he will fix Bush's economic squeeze.  Meanwhile,  urlLink hiring prospects are exploding .  I don't know if Kerry reads the news or just ignores it, but as my folks used to say "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

						   The big question asked in my previous post on Linux and networking was if it is possible to use one Linux box to serve as a DHCP server, an HTTP server, an FTP server, a DNS server, and a LAN server.  The short answer is yes.  I now have all of the daemons running on my server.  It assigns IP addresses via DHCP as it is supposed to.  Apache is running.  Xinetd is running.  Samba is running.  Bind is running.  Kudos to me.  As an aside, this is no small undertaking.  The documentation for Linux is not terribly convenient.  I had to sift through man pages, commented configuration and sample files and how tos to patch everything together.  One of the less helpfully commented sample configuration files looked something like this:  ; Sample .conf file ; 123 @ SOA domain.here ; declaration  this is a useless line that will be ignored  111 aaa bbb ; args  #ignore me  So, having all of these things working on some level is an accomplishment on its own.  The worst thing about the documentation is that it isn't laid out logically.  Most of the information only applies to very specific parts of the process so when setting up the dhcpd module you have to hunt through a whole mess of files and folders to find the ones that need editing.  It's a lucky thing to find references to other files that need to be configured while editing one.  Only by hunting through as much of the documentation as I could find did I learn that setting up Bind meant editing named.conf then creating *.zone files for my domain and then editing the named.conf.include file to point to the *.zone file.  I would be disingenuous if I led you to believe that all of these things are working exactly as they ought to be.  I think I'm probably trying to do to many things at one time and would have more complete success if I focused on one task at a time but I don't operate like that.   Also, it makes some things easier to get these things working at more or less the same time.  For example, setting up the DHCP server makes it easier to connect clients because you don't have to worry about assigning IP addresses.  Having the Apache web server running makes it easier to set up Samba because you can't use the Swat utitility to change the Samba configuration files unless the httpd process is running.  Swat is a form-based utility run in a web browser that allows you to update your Samba configuration files.  It's much easier than scouring through smb.conf files.  I still have some problems to work out.  DHCPD doesn't start on boot.  I have to manually start the dhcpd process with the command dhcpd eth0.  I used the chkconfig command to change the runlevel but I haven't found where to define the interface to be used.  That's why I have to manually specify the eth0 interface.  Samba is running almost satisfactorily.  My windows machine detects the workgroup but I can't browse to any of the shares.  I believe the problem is that user priveleges on the shares are set to deny so I need to change the user priveleges to allow remote users to access the shares.  Once that is done I should be able to map the share as a network drive.  Setting up DNS is the real bitch.  Bind is running but I can't figure out where to specify the domain I want to use.  I'm going to use ziggurat.home.  I need to set it up as a zone in the named file but I'm forever getting errors about invalid syntax in my *.zone file or in the zone section of the named.conf file.  The errors make no sense to me because I've even used examples that are supposed to be functional.  When I do find a reference to my domain it's always Linux or localhost.  Linux is not specified anywhere as a domain or as an alias that I'm aware of and localhost is simply the loopback for my Linux box.  I need to dig up some more information about Bind and DNS.  I just got the http daemon working so I haven't tinkered with it much so far.  I think it will be something of a bitch too though.  I want to be able to create subdomains for the projects I'm working on so I can have (for example) http://mysqlproj.ziggurat.home, http://phpproj.ziggurat.home, http://perlproj.ziggurat.home.  Both Apache and Bind support this, but the problem I have is that I have no idea what the directory structure will look like or where it is supposed to live, or how to specify the path.  I know how the http file structure looks since I've done some web development, but not how it fits into the Linux directory structure.  I'm fairly certain this information is buried somewhere in the Apache documentation or in the httpd.conf comments.  It'll just take some digging and some trial and error.  You can ditto all of the above for ftp.  Actually, one thing I've hardly even mentioned is MySQL.  I also intend for my Linux box to be a MySQL server.  As things stand now I don't even know what questions to ask except how do I start the MySQLd process?  All of the commands give me an error and tell me to read the manual which is over 1000 pages long.  I guess I'll just have to start the long slog.  I can say it is coming together.  My clients are all assigned IP addresses via the DHCP daemon.  I can wrestle the clients into accessing the Apache documentation pages and the Swat utility which means Apache is running as it is supposed to.  I can navigate to the Samba Server, even if I can't yet access the shares.  Here are the questions I intend to answer in the immediate future.  1.  How do I assign the domain I want to use for my intranet? 2.  How do I create subdomains?  And are these zones? 3.  How do I create a directory structure for my domain and for my web development projects?  Where do I locate this directory structure? 4.  How do I give my clients access to the Samba shares and to their own Samba directories?  My best means of answering these questions is trial and error and scouring through the documentation.  I've heard and read a lot of things that rave about how well documented the linux modules are and how extensive the help, but there are a couple of problems with the documentation.  A lot of it is written by and for people who already have some idea of what it is they're doing.  It's also written sort of reflexively.  It's like having a dictionary with circular definitions.  Crotchety means grouchy.  Grouchy means crotchety.  A domain is a location defined by an IP address.  An IP address defines the location of a domain.  A domain server gives a domain an IP address and conversely assigns an IP address to a domain.    Another problem is that there are often pages and pages of nuts and bolts information about how these services work.  I know in excruciating detail the 4 step process that is how IP addresses are assigned using DCHP, but barely enough about the practicalities of making Linux into a DHCP server to make it happen.  It's like taking a driving course and learning about the internal combustion engine that causes vehicular perambulation.    This is why Linux is not terribly popular among casual users or even professionals.  It has a lot going for it in some ways but learning how to use it is a hell of a project.  I've searched for a lot of information but I can seldom find things that lay out the processes logically.  Nor is there much information that bridges the gap between developer and mechanic.  Command line commands aren't discussed anywhere except from within Linux.  The command line is very useful for setting these services up and testing them, but there aren't any references that tell you what commands to use or how to use them.  Users who are new to Linux and the command line would be a complete loss as to how to use it.  I've learned a number of basic commands, but know very few of the arguments.  The man pages don't do much good from the command line because you can't see them and type on the command line at the same time.  The command -h isn't very helpful unless you already know what the arguments do and just need a reminder of which one you want.  Like I mentioned, a lot of the manuals tell you all you could ever want to know about the processes and why they work and what they do, but it's a rare thing to find a clear cut  how , which in my case is what I really want to know.  Going back to the driving lesson, you could learn everything there is to know about why the internal combustion engine works and what it does, but that doesn't mean you will know how to operate it.  In any case, I think it's interesting and useful enough to be worth my attention and I will keep hammering away at it.

						   To Ronald Reagan;  Darkness clouded the early days of your time in office but you saw the light.  Your steady example guided the rest of America towards the light you saw.  Time has proven the acuity of your vision.  Your vision was born of optimism unbound, patriotism unfettered, courage undaunted.  You believed that America was a land of great people and great ideas, although you may not have counted yourself among them.  An old adage has it that there are no great people, only ordinary people who do great things.  You, sir, prove its truth.    Your loss reminds us of the ideals in which you so firmly believed.  It reminds us why they are important to America and to the world.  You will not be missed, Mr. Reagan.  You will be remembered.

						   By the end it will all have been said twice.  I'm a little startled at the surge of emotion Ronald Reagan's death has precipitated.  They who appreciated him place him in the top ten presidents of our nations history.  Those with less favorable recollections vent unadulterated vitriolic spleen.  I'm not old enough to remember most of Reagan's administration but I'm smart enough to read my history.  Ronald Reagan was a victim of circumstance as much as he was an adept political figure.  When Reagan was elected, the Soviet Union was about to collapse under its own weight.  Communism was its own source of destruction.  Reagan was not directly responsible for its death.  He was responsible for the acceleration of the collapse though.  Reagan pumped additional money into the military and reignited the arms race.  It was the straw that broke the camel's back.  He had the good fortune to be president during that time, and the wit to seize the opportunity.  He made some hard economic decisions, but combined with the end of the Cold War it set the stage for the boom of the 90s.  People howl about Reaganomics, but sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better.   urlLink In 1980 , when Reagan was elected, the inflation rate was over 13%.  In 1984 at the beginning of his second term the inflation rate was a little over 4%.  Interest rates peaked in 1980 at 21.5%.  In 1984 they were 11%.  His economic policies inflated unemployment for his first term, but the unemployment rate fell throughout his second term to 5%.    I think he will be remembered for something other than his politics though.  He was a good man, he treated people with dignity and respect.  Even the letter he wrote to the American people when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's was encouraging and generous of spirit.  He was the kind of man people could believe in.  During both terms, Reagan's approval rating hung damn close to 50%.  He was not wildly popular but over 50% of America believed in him and trusted him.  And he didn't let them down.  He stuck to his guns; he did what he thought was right.  I suspect he will fade into mediocrity with time.  He won't be counted among the very best of American presidents, but he made our world a little better than it had been, and for that he can rest peacefully.

						   I have a desktop computer running Linux and a laptop running Windows XP.  I don't know if it's possible, but I'm trying to use my desktop as a server that will do the following:  1.  DHCP assignment of IP addresses 2.  DNS Server 3.  HTML Server (Apache 2.0) 4.  FTP Server 5.  Document/Print Server  This system is not on the internet right now so IP addresses and domain names can be completely arbitrary.  I suspect it will be a nightmare if I ever do decide to actually use it on the internet, but it's just an exercise for now.  So, my Linux machine has all of the modules installed that should be necessary.  I have installed Samba Server, Samba Client, LDAP Server/client, Apache 2.0, Lisa, DHCP Server, DNS Server, and a few others.  The first question I have is possible or not?  Can my Linux machine provide all of these functions (as far as I can tell, I'm trying to set up my Linux box so it fools the laptop into believing it is connected to a lan and the internet).  I'll only be able to access one domain, but that's not a problem, since the purpose of this exercise is to give me a realistic network/web development environment.  In the future (near future even) I might want to set up virtual domain name hosting so I can work on mutiple web development projects.  For now I just want to get it working.  I can divide my development project using the directory structure instead of a domain structure (e.g. I can set up my domain to be http://linuxbox.projects/project1, http://linuxbox.projects/projects2 instead of http://linuxbox.project1/index, http://linuxbox.project2/index).  Anyhow, I think I may need to get some different hardware.  Here's what I have right now:  1.  Desktop running Suse Linux 9.  450 Mhz (can be upgraded to dual processors) 512 Mb ram.  10 Gb hardrive + 80 Gb hardrive.  10/100 ethernet card.  Lots of peripheral gadgetry, Firewire card, USB hub, External CD RW, Internal CDRW, USB Soundcard, Fire Zip.  2.  Laptop running Windows XP.  1.3 Ghz Centrino.  512 Mb ram.  40 Gb hardrive.  10/100 Integrated Ethernet, WiFi, Firewire, USB.  3.  Simple network hub.  Do I need a router?  My Linux machine seems to be able to serve as a router.  Can this be set up as well or does that simply add to the headache?  My first priority is for my desktop to serve as a virtual ISP/host for my laptop and for it to serve as an HTTP/FTP server (with MySQL) so I can have a realistic web development environment.  Second priority is for it to serve as a LAN file/print server.  My question then becomes how do I do this?  So far, I've gotten Apache up and running.  When logged in as a local user on my Linux machine I can load the http://localhost page.  It took a mere two days and three complete installs to get that far.  I have a tendency to fuck up my installed Linux kernel and have to start over.  Anyhow, I now need my Linux machine to assign my laptop an IP address, and allow me to view the //localhost page from my Windows machine.  This is where I'm at a complete loss.  My Linux box ought to assign my Windows box an IP address via DHCP.  I may need to set up my Windows ethernet connection differently, but that isn't a problem.  The problem is Linux doesn't seem to be broadcasting the DHCP information.    I can't get my Windows machine to recognize my Linux machine as any kind of server.  My Windows machine makes up its own IP address.  It can successfully ping the Linux IP address but the reverse is not true.  Network services are activated on the Linux machine but I get an error when I try to ping the Windows IP address.  I have gotten Linux to network with Windows in the past using Lisa (the LAN browser daemon) but for entertainment purposes I want a server based network instead of a peer to peer.  That may be a different project.  I think Samba is the dealy I want to use for that, but who the hell knows?  My questions are as follows:  1.  How do I make Linux broadcast the DHCP information that will assign my Windows machine an IP address?  And do I need different/additional hardware to make it happen? 2.  Once that is done, will Windows recognize my Linux box as a Domain Name Server? 3.  How do I create a domain? 4.  Given that I can use my Linux machine as both a DHCP/DNS server and fool my Windows machine into thinking it's on the internet, can I then also use my Linux machine as a file/print server using Samba?

						   A reader on my old site argued that we could build a solar array large enough to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  Unfortunately, the idea is not practical.  He wrote:   "So, to supply all the energy the country needs we need to have 500,000 Acres (782 square miles)of Solar Arrays. to supply 300 million people with all of their energy needs. . .  Of course, gasoline is only a small amount of the energy that we use. If you have numbers for the amount of gasoline we use in a day to support the conjecture that we couldn't possiblly use hydrogen, then have at it."   Total energy consumption notwithstanding, America used about  urlLink 461 gallons of gas  per person in 2002.  Figuring about 300 million people that amounts to 138,300,000,000 gallons of gas.  Gas is an energy source and one gallon of  urlLink gas contains 1.3e8  or 130,000,000 joules (a joule is a unit of energy).  Stretched over the course of a year that amounts to about 591,000,000,000 watts.  Or 591,000 megawatts.  Solar panels aren't very good at converting sunlight to electricity.   urlLink Good panels  at peak produce about 12 watts per square foot.  We use 591 billion watts worth of gasoline.  To produce that much electricity requires 49,250,000,000 square feet or about 1,767 square miles.  782 is less than half what is needed for gasoline alone much less total electrical consumption.  It's still only a little over 1% the size of Arizona, but that's a lot of square feet worth of pv panels.  I'll figure that these things always operate at their peak of about 12 watts per square foot, but for that to happen, they have to be mounted on a tracking system that follows the sun east to west and north to south throughout the year.  They lose efficiency quickly as the solar incidence moves away from 90 degrees to the surface of the panel.  Complete systems cost about $100 per square foot.  Given a super Costco bulk discount, I'll figure it costs $60 per square foot to purchase and assemble these kits (including panels, tracking systems, inverters, labor, heavy equipment, administrative costs, etc).  The cost to assemble the entire array is nearly $3 trillion.    I'd be surprised if these things can survive ten years worth of sand laden desert wind storms, but if they do have a life of 10 years, the maintenance cost is $300 billion per year after the first ten years.  Americans spent about $276,600,000,000 on gas (less since the average was less than $2.00 per gallon in 2002).  That doesn't even pay for maintenance much less recoup the capital cost for the array.  I haven't figured the cost of building a hydrogen fuel infrastructure, and I've assumed that these panels will work at peak efficiency and that 100% of the electricity will be converted to hydrogen.  I think we would actually be doing quite well if 50% of the electricity was converted into hydrogen.  One other thing I haven't added is the inevitable legal wrangling.  Environmentalists go nuts over housing developments built on one or two sqare miles.  We're talking about paving over 1,700 square miles with photovoltaics.  It would change the albedo of that area and affect surrounding weather patterns, not to mention any incidental tortoises, lizards, or endgangered dirt that might need a champion.  Yet, even with my conservative estimate we can't even pay for the upkeep of the solar array.  That doesn't account for the upkeep of the hydrogen infrastructure.  If you doubt there will be litigation, guess again.  Environmentalists here in the Bay Area added billions of dollars to the cost of the new Benicia bridge because they discovered that fish died when trapped in boxes near the pile drivers.  They got a judge to issue an administrative order and CalTrans had to study the effect of pile drivers on the fish.  Surprisingly it turns out the fish swim away from the pile driver while it's operating.  I've read of half a dozen multi-million dollar lawsuits against housing developments in the last five years because these developments endager salamanders or frogs or some other critter or weed or patch of dirt.    Beyond the cost of the project, there is a timeframe issue as well.  I arbitrarily decided it could be done in 10 years but I doubt it.  I can't find an estimate but I know the industry does not produce anywhere near 5 billion square feet of PV per year.  And even if it can be done in ten years it will fall short of meeting our gas consumption at that time.    We could upgrade our coal or nuclear power production enough to produce significant amounts of hydrogen but if greenliness is your platform, that's out of the question.

						   I'm on a technology kick right now, and with oil prices where they are, everyone is thinking about energy and novel energy sources. I'm as curious as anybody about such things, but perhaps better read on the topic.  I'm something of a skeptic as far as novel energy sources go.  I just thought it would be interesting to discuss energy sources that currently exist and the ones that may come available in the future.   Hydrocarbons   This is mostly where the U.S. is today.  Coal provides the majority of American electricity.  Coal is smashed into dust (literally) the dust is injected into the furnace where it burns, heats water to steam, spins the turbine, and actuates the dynamo.  Presto-changeo coal becomes electricity.  Coal is a great fuel for electricity.  It burns hot (somewhere in the neighborhood of 3000 F).  More importantly coal is ubiquitous in the United States.  There are about 500 billion short tons of recoverable coal in the U.S.  As mining technology improves so will the amount of recoverable coal.  Coal is easy to mine and plentiful.  It does have drawbacks.  For one thing it's filthy.  We have developed technology to limit the dirtiness of coal, so it's not as bad as it was fifty years ago.  In fact, there's a coal power plant in Wheatland, Wyoming that is absolutely amazing for it's cleanliness.  If you were the sort to do such things, you could eat off the floor.  But coal power plants still release  urlLink radioactive elements  into the atmosphere and produce staggering amounts of somewhat radioactive slag.  It's not exactly a tree-huggers dream.  Natural gas is less polluting but less efficient.  Oil is also used to generate some electricity but it has better uses.   Hydroelectric   Hydroelectric accounts for about 2% of America's electricity.  Hoover dam is a hydroelectric power plant.  A dam is built to contain a river.  Pipes are placed near the bottom of the dam.  As the water rises, it creates a big fucking head of pressure that forces water through the pipes, past the turbines which actuate the dynamo and once again we have electricity.  Hydroelectric is a decent source of electricity it produces a lot, but there are a limited number of places where hydroelectric dams can be built.  Ecofrauds go nuts anytime somebody says dam.   Others   Others account for 1% of America's electricity.  Others includes wind turbines, geothermal, and solar.  Wind turbines are horrible.  Vast fields of these things have to be built to generate any significant amount of electricity.  They're an inefficient eyesore.  Solar power can take two forms, one is photo-voltaics, the other is mirrors.  Solar and wind power both have a similar problem.  The total energy is enormous, but it is diffuse and inconstant.  Geothermal is limited to very specific parts of the world, where the crust is thin enough for internal energy to affect the surface.  Wyoming could produce a not insignificant amount of geothermal electricty from Yellowstone but we all know that will never happen.   Nuclear   Fission acounts for about 20% of America's electricity.  Given appropriate containment procedures (which we have), nuclear fission is probably the most desirable energy source that is presently viable.  It produces enormous amounts of energy at low cost, and is environmentally friendly.  Ecofrauds hate nuclear power.  They constantly argue about the radioactive leftovers.  It's not much of an argument really.  The hot waste is stored in boro-silicate boxes which could then be buried in the mine from which the raw materials were extracted.  By the time geological processes brought this stuff back to the surface it would no longer be hot and no more dangerous than common background radiation.  Unfortunately, nuclear power is politically dead in the U.S.  The regulatory burden prevents anybody from building a new nuclear reactor in the U.S.  Until people pull their heads out it will remain dead.  I do believe it will eventually become viable once again, but probably not for some time.  There are many other ideas for producing electricity.  Some of them are downright foolish, others are highly speculative.   Bio Fuels   I'm using this as an inclusive category for things like biomass, biodiesel and ethanol.  This is one of those that is downright foolish.  People who promote these as ideas for fuel sources simply have no grasp of the staggering amounts of energy we use in the U.S.  Bio fuels could even include trees.  Simply burning timber for electricity.  It's been done for a long time.  Until we discovered coal, wood and peat were primary sources of fuel.  Practically the entire island of Great Britain was deforested prior to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution because wood was one of the few sources of energy.  In fact, the lack of wood for burning spurred the Industrial Revolution because people were forced to use coal and peat.  Anyhow, if Europe could exhaust their most convenient supply of biomass (timber) over three hundred years ago, how could we possibly produce enough biomass to meet today's energy needs?   Alternative Hydroelectric   Hydroelectric means electricity from water.  These are some ideas floating around for different ways of generating electricity from water, other than using dams.  One is using tides to actuate dynamos.  The problem is tides don't really change very much in most parts of the world.  At least not enough that we can really capture their energy.  I won't say it can't be done, but I think right now we just don't have any idea how to go about it.  Dams work because we're able to creat a big fucking head of pressure to force water through pipes.  Tides don't rise and fall enough to do that (except maybe in the Bay of Fundy).  I found an idea where oceanic currents could be used to turn turbines, but while currents are more constant than wind they are still too diffuse, and the cost of building an underwater facility would be astronomical.  One other source of hydroelectric is the  urlLink OTEC .  I think OTECs are very sexy electricity producers, but there are some hurdles to be overcome before they are commercially viable.  I can't say I think there is any reason they can't work, but for now the cost of constructing one large enough to produce a significant amount of electricity is prohibitive.   Fusion   A lot of money and research is being poured into fusion.  I think the U.S. would be better off spending this money on particle accelerators or telescopes since the ecofrauds won't like fusion any more than they like fission, but I'm just a lowly peon taxpayer.  I also think we lack the understanding we need to make fusion function.  We're tinkering with the process and getting closer to making it work, but I like I said, studying the underlying science of fusion would probably take us further than trial and error.  Anyhow fusion is the opposite of fission.  Instead of tearing atoms apart we're mashing them together (fusing) them.  It will potentially be very clean and produce enormous amounts of power, but probably not for many years.  I think cold fusion is a fairy tale.  I know enough about physics to know it takes an unbelievable amount of energy to make atoms fuse.  In stars it works because gravity is strong enough to overcome the repulsion of atoms.  In fusion reactors we heat the atoms until they are so energetic they smash into each other and fuse together.  Fusion also has a little radioactivity problem.  Much worse than fission at this point.  The fuels we use in fusion produce spare particles that aren't converted into electricity and can't be easily contained.  These particles escape the reactor and plow through the rest of the structure creating a radioactive power plant.  The only way fusion would really be acceptable is if we found the mixture of fuels that doesn't produce these spare particles.  We know what the fuel is (Helium 3 and Deuterium) but He-3 is extremely rare on earth.  It does exist on the moon, so there is a possibility that future moon bases could be powered by fusion.  I do believe fusion will eventually be a source of energy, but not for some time, and possibly never on Earth.   Alternative Geothermal   There is a way to sort of artificially produce geothermal electricity.  Instead of wrecking Yellowstone, we create an artificial geyser by drilling a hole deep into the crust of the earth and pouring water into it.  This is called a core tap.  The hole has to be deep enough that the water is boiled into steam.  It blasts up through the hole and spins turbines.  For now we don't have the technology to drill deeply enough for this to work.  I don't think there is any reason to think we won't be able to do so in the not so distant future though.   Orbital Solar   Solar energy on the earth is too diffuse to work well.  In orbit things are different though.  Photo-voltaics are not terribly useful, all things considered, they only operate at 10% efficiency.  Solar energy is actually more efficient if it is converted to heat by using mirrors to focus it on a reservoir of water.  It takes a lot of mirrors to heat water to boiling though.  A lot of mirrors, as in paving many square miles of land with mirrors.  Also the mirrors on Earth have to track the sun, since it so inconveniently tools about in the sky.  In space satellites can be positioned so they collect solar energy 24 hours a day.  Better yet, a space mirror is pretty easy to build.  Inflate a large bubble.  Without gravity it will form a near perfect sphere.  Silver half the inside of the bubble (preferably the half facing the sun).  Since a sphere's focus is at the center the reservoir is placed at the center of the bubble and the water boils where the sunlight is concentrated.  But, to produce a significant amount of electricity would still require an extemely large mirror.  After that you have to transport the energy to earth, probably via microwaves.  On earth you have to have a microwave collector (called a rectenna).  And it also has to be large.  I suspect it's not very efficient, but I think it would be acceptable if space transport costs fell enough.  Sending the equipment to space would price a solar satellite power plant out of the running for now.  I have faith the X-Prize and other such commercialization projects will eventually make it viable, but probably not for at least a decade or longer.    Finally, there are a couple of potential theoretical sources of power.  One is a probability, the other less so.   Matter/Antimatter   I think that once we have a firm grasp of the principles underlying particle physics fusion and fission will be no-brainers.  Our current fission and fusion knowledge is brute force kind of knowledge, but once we have an understanding of the hows and whys it will open the door to direct matter/energy conversion.  We are far from reaching this point but we probably will eventually.  It's a pretty simple concept.  Matter and antimatter annhilate when they contact.  The result is energy.  It's near perfect conversion of matter into energy and the amount of energy is phenomenal.  I don't think anybody rightly knows what technological hurdles have to be overcome to reach this stage of development but I don't think there's any reason to think we never will.  At least not until we learn otherwise.   Zero Point Energy   This will probably come to nothing, but it is an idea.  I get the feeling the folks who believe in ZP energy are the same ones who think they can talk to aliens through their tinfoil hat.  But Zero Point energy has been proven to exist.  It's called the  urlLink Casimir effect .  It's an artifact of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  The problem is nobody knows if it can be scaled to be useful in a macroscopic world.  There are no shortage of folks out their claiming they have built devices that operate using zero point energy.  In reality, if they had done so the world would be a different place by next week.  Generally the claim goes that they are just trying to raise the capital to produce their device (or Halliburton is suppressing it).  If they could demonstrate the efficacy of their device, they would have to beat investors off with a stick.  So, while zero point energy actually does exist, we have yet to determine how it can be harnessed or if can be used to any practical effect.  For example an engine can be built that uses the Casimir effect as an energy source but it can only be fired once.  It's a nice dream, but probably not much more than that.  There are other more outlandish claims about sources of free energy, but they are inconsistent with the structure of our reality.  You know, the Laws of Thermodynamics and such.  A quick search of the web will give you thousands of hits on people who claim to know the secret to controlling gravity, producing energy from nothing, harnessing angular momentum.  It's all bunk.  There are laws that make our universe what it is.  If they were violable our universe would cease to exist.  My favorite is the guy who claims he knows how to  urlLink manipulate gravity .  In the future we might discover some loopholes but for now we have to color within the lines.

						   Yesterday I was browsing  urlLink Pushback  and  urlLink Envirotruth .  Today I read iRi's blog (title link) and an idea was born.  Funny how that works.  Anyhow, in many ways, the ecofrauds are masters of marketing.  The likes of the Sierra Club and Greenpeace are cleverly disguised marketing corporations peddling ridiculous ideas.  Greenpeace is actually a fraudulent corporation of the Enron brand(and is  urlLink domestic terrorists  no less ardent in their collective belief than Islamic fundamentalists).  Greenpeace has around 5 million members (make that 5 million car driving, bicycle riding, electricity using, finished product consuming members).  While I could turn this into a tirade about the hypocrisy of these folks, I will resist.  If these people had their way our entire civilization would collapse.  In fact, it seems they want our civilization to revert to a pre-technology stage.  If the world bought Greenpeace tripe where would we be?    1.  They don't like genetically modified food (nevermind humans have been doing this since we discovered agriculture).  Without GM crops we would need to cultivate every acre of arable land in the world to keep the current population alive.  Not that we would be allowed to do so since that would mean destoying millions of acres of prairie land and forests.  Famine anyone?    2.  Water has to be clean but clean water is usually home to bacteria.  Greenpeacers would have us stop treating water with chlorine.  I'll have a glass of giardia juice with my organic omelet, thanks.  3.  We should be using 'green' energy production like solar power or wind turbines.  Of course producing sufficient amounts of solar energy would mean paving a fair chunk of the Mojave desert with solar collectors (mirrors or solar panels).  Wind turbines are nearly worthless.  Vast fields of them are necessary to produce an appreciable amount of electricity.  Not exactly a golf-course view, is it?  4.  Hydrogen is a lovely dream, but it takes energy to produce hydrogen.  And the amount of hydrogen we would need would require lots and lots of energy to produce.  The only source of hydrogen large enough to meet our demand is the ocean (water).  Water has to be electrolyzed to produce hydrogen.  Catch-22.  There is a reciprocal relationship between resources, technology and the environment though, and this is more or less where we stand.  Certainly we treat the environment better today than we did fifty or one hundred fifty years ago.  And not because the Greenpeacers have opened our eyes but because the market recognizes the value in maximizing resource consumption versus advancement and because technology allows us to do so.  Where are we likely headed in terms of technology?  I think we will eventually move to fission power.  For now the regulatory strangulation prevents construction of new fission power plants so we're stuck with coal (the filthiest of all options).  In time I suspect the resistance to fission will be eroded.  If we do ever move entirely to fission there is potential that we will produce enough surplus electricity to migrate towards a hydrogen economy.    Fusion would be even more ideal for a hydrogen economy but I think fusion is more than a few decades away.  Barring the fact we haven't achieved the break even point, we must also be concerned about the radiation problem with fusion reactors.  Another problem with fusion is that we are moving beyond the point where it will be feasible to recoup the R&D costs.  That's not to say fusion will never be viable, just that we aren't there yet.  And I think there are probably a lot of tangential benefits of fusion research.  OTECs are another possibility and Japan is researching this avenue more than anywhere else.  It's a little ironic that the same people screaming for a hydrogen economy are the ones most likely to throw themselves in front of a bulldozer as it breaks ground for a new fission power plant.    Anyhow, once we do move away from hydrocarbons there will be a corresponding shift in the application of raw materials.  Coal mining and natural gas drilling will be less important, and instead uranium mining will be lucrative.  Having grown up in Wyoming, I know that coal mining is a huge operation.  Practically the entire state of Wyoming sits on top of a massive seam of coal (Factoid of the day:  Wyoming produces over 90% of the country's helium).  Up until recently the best way to get at the coal has been open pit mining which is exactly what it sounds like.  An enormous pit is dug down to the surface of the coal bed.  The coal is shattered by dynamite explosions, a dragline scoops up coal by the cubic acre and haul trucks take it to the train.  There's a break even point where it is no longer economical to dig a pit down to the coal.  In that case underground mines are more economical.  In order to determine the economics of coal mining they factor in the reclamation project.  Once the coal has been mined the pit has to be filled in and biologists reseed the area with native plants and grasses.  The reclamation for an underground mine is far less expensive and less disruptive of the surrounding ecology which makes Uranium mining more attractive than strip mining of coal beds.  Not to mention the discrepancy between fission and hydrocarbon emissions.  Anyhow all of the resources poured into strip mining are shifted to other resource gathering projects.  So, while we are in no danger of running out of coal, it can serve as more of a fallback if necessary and we can pursue other avenues.  Other technologies that could promise to extend the life of our finite resources are biotech and nanotechnology, both of which are under fire.  The howlers battling against biotech really make me nuts.  We've been pursuing biotechnology since we invented domestication.  Modern day domestic plants and animals hardly resemble their ancient ancestors.  Compare  urlLink teosinte  with  urlLink corn .  This is an example of genetic manipulation.  It may have taken hundred of years, but humans modified the genetic structure of ancient teosinte until it became modern day corn.  Today we have the ability to do so more rapidly.  Furthermore, modern genetically modified crops are modified in such a way that they are unable to reproduce.  The idea that some superweed will emerge is unfounded.  The idea that GM crops cause cancer or disease is equally ridiculous since the difference between 'GM' crops and normal crops is a matter of protein structures which are broken down during digestion anyhow.  If it weren't for genetic modification, there would be fewer people and more hungry ones in the world than there are today.  That being said, genetic modification will further reduce reliance on existing resources.  Eventually (it's already happening to some degree) specific medical molecules will be grown and harvested using plants or algae.  I could agree that biotech needs some degree of oversight, but I think it's benefits outweigh it's potential pitfalls and firmly believe it should be pursued with diligence.    Coming full circle, this all shows how our resource base shifts with changing technology.  Fission will shift focus from coal and natural gas to uranium.  Biotech makes arable land a new sort of resource (not necessarily food-related) and reduces reliance on petrochemicals which are a source of many of our modern medicines.  These resources are also limited, but give us additional breathing room to continue to progress as a society.  And eventually, with luck, we will find that perfect balance.

						    Journalists    urlLink Den Beste of Starship Clueless  writes about media bias and the changing status of journalists.  Monday, Pete Wilson of KGO posed this question:  "If a journalist uncovers information about an attack before the attack, should they do something about it or wait, and report on the subsequent events?"  Some time ago, Peter Jennings (yak) and Mike Wallace (ditto) said a journalists job is to report and they would be derelict in their duty to report the pending attack.  They are journalists before Americans.  Their loyalty to America does not extend so far as protecting those who protect the very rights they are exercising.  Nor does their humanity seem to extend so far as to protect life.  Not all journalists think as do Jennings and Wallace, but to my mind there is no decision to be made.   The R Card   The R Card is a good idea.  It's a ready made permission slip parents can give their under-17 kids to get them into R rated movies.  I suppose the theory is that parents will talk with their kids and know if they are mature enough to be allowed to watch R rated films.  I approve.   The Day After Tomorrow   I've not seen it (nor will I) but The Day After Tomorrow hit theatres.  It goes in the category of The Core.  It is too obviously ridiculous to be worth watching.  I didn't watch the Core, because I couldn't stomach the foolishness.  In The Core the earth's core stops spinning and the magnetic field collapses allowing cosmic radiation to scorch the planet.  The only way to fix the problem is to tunnel to the center of the earth and detonate nuclear weapons to make it start rotating again.  I'm a huge science fiction fan but that's beyond my ability to suspend belief.  I get the same feeling from The Day After Tomorrow previews.  Global warming changes the earth's weather patterns to such extremities that a gigantic tidal wave swamps New York City and subsequently freezes (in a matter of days or weeks as far as I can tell).  Please.  At least in actual science fiction there is an attempt to make up some sort of explanation that helps suspend belief, like a giant alien death beam or an inter-dimensional space anomaly.  I hereby create a new genre of film.  It shall be known as Science Fraud.  The Core, and The Day After Tomorrow are the first inductees.   Random Thoughts   A few thoughts about some other movies.  I saw Van Helsing Sunday.  It was a fun movie.  Lots of nifty gadgets and weapons and how can you go wrong with Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein?  But why are vampire minions always sexy women and never sexy guys?   Has anybody seen Ronin?  What was in the damned brief case?

						   In science quantities are measured with some sort of scale. Science tries to use an absolute scale whenever possible. An absolute scale doesn’t change depending on where the measurement is taken or who is taking the measurement. Temperature is measured with an absolute scale. 0 degrees Fahrenheit is cold and 110 degrees Fahrenheit is pretty hot by human standards. 0 degrees Fahrenheit is the same temperature in Ulan Bataar as it is in Boston. Additionally, the size of one degree Fahrenheit is the same everywhere so the difference between 68 degrees and 69 degrees is the same everywhere because the size of the degree doesn’t change. Distance is another absolute scale of measurement. One mile equals one mile everywhere you go. Some scales are relative.  Currency is a relative scale. As temperature is a measure of the amount of heat in a substance, currency is a measure of the amount of stuff you can buy. Currency is relative because one unit of currency is not the same where you go and it is dependent on what unit of currency you use. Five U.S. dollars aren’t worth a whole lot in the U.S. That will buy you a decent snack. If you take that same five dollars to Peru it will buy you an excellent lunch probably with a beer and a cup of coffee. On the other hand five Sols (Peruvian currency) will buy you a fair lunch in Peru but almost nothing in the U.S.  Some scales use more than one unit of measurement to arrive at a value. Velocity and acceleration are measured using combinations of distance and time units. Momentum is measured using a combination of mass, distance, and time units.  Morality is also measured in some way. It can be done according to an absolute scale or to a relative scale. It is a combination of units. It isn’t possible to assign a number, but people still have a means of applying a measurement to morality and the units we generally use are magnitude and intent. In an earlier post I used a thieving bread man as an example to illustrate these two units. Theft is a moral infraction, but we tend to agree that in some forms it is palatable while in others it is despicable.  If we return to the bread man and think about the situation as observers, we can see how the process works. The bread man has a couple of hungry kids. Out of desperation he steals bread to feed the kids. He gets caught. How will he be judged when the truth of his story is verified? We, as observers, first think that stealing is wrong. He didn’t earn the bread; it is wrong of him to take it. Of course, it was only a loaf of bread, and he was only doing it out of desperation. It was right of him to do what he could to take care of the kids. So, the wrongness of his theft is minimized because the magnitude of his theft was small and the intent of his theft was for an understandable reason. We give a value to the intent and the magnitude of his moral infraction and arrive at an amount of wrongness.  In science scales usually have an underlying physical principle that makes them absolute regardless of what we might wish for them to be. Time is measured using the oscillations of a certain Cesium isotope. The oscillations of this particular isotope is true for every other instance of this isotope existing in the universe (as far as we know) and is true no matter where in the universe any instance of this isotope is taken. The frequency will not change if we measure it in San Francisco or while orbiting Alpha Centauri. Distance is measured as the distance traveled by a beam of light in a vacuum over a certain period of time. It too is the same no matter what beam of light you use or where in the vacuum it is measured.  Mass is a different story. We haven’t found a reliable means of defining an amount of mass. The best science has come up with so far is to arbitrarily pick a chunk of metal (a Platinum Iridium alloy) and say this is how much a kilogram is. The problem with this is that no two masses are identical. They are close enough that we can’t easily discern a difference but the fact remains. No two masses are identical to each other or to the standard chunk.  Measuring morality is like mass because no two people have identical moral scales and our only external standard is largely arbitrary. People have tried to create an external moral standard. I think this is a big part of where religion comes from. Religious texts spend a lot of time making distinctions between desirable behavior and undesirable behavior, but we have a whole lot of these texts and most of them disagree. Christians and Jews use the Holy Bible (I know the Jews don’t necessarily believe in the New Testament but the foundation is the same for both). Muslims refer to the Koran. Buddhists refer to the teachings of Buddha and to animistic beliefs. Hindis ascribe to Vedas and other things.  Enter moral relativity. The argument goes that if our respective moral guides are completely arbitrary, who is to say that one is better than another? Technically, we can’t fairly say that one is better than another. The extension of this idea is to then hold members of a moral school accountable to their respective scales. Christians will be held to their Judeo/Greek/Christian Scale, Muslims to their Koranic scale, Buddhists to Buddha, and Hindis to their (many many many) scale(s). As far as I can tell this tends to be where a fair portion of the liberal camp stands.  The other side of the coin is that somebody does actually say ‘ours is better‘. I’m of this school. I think our Western moral tradition is better. No apologies or regrets. Conservatives tend to this side of things. It isn’t fair or sensitive, but there you have it. You can point to specific morals from a different group of people that are more fair or beneficial than the Western counterpart but on the whole, ours is superior.  Our morality comes from three sources. Judaism, Christianity, and the Greeks. Both Plato and Aristotle did some examination of morality and the like and they influenced our Western perception of morality. Morality as I said in an earlier post, is a pure form of how we think we as individuals and by extension as a society ought to behave to be ideal as both. However, I think their more important contribution was that they allowed us to consider morality from a more logical perspective.  Hollywood often creates extreme situations to examine heady issues like morality. John Q (spoilers ahead) was such a movie. A guy’s kid ends up with some heart disease and needs a transplant. The dad does everything he can but can’t afford the heart so he holds the ER (or maybe the ICU) hostage at gunpoint until his kid gets a heart. I think the underlying premise of the movie is that somebody must make a choice about who will benefit from our limited supply of hearts. Usually an administrator of some sort decides who gets a heart and who doesn’t. I think it is an inherently moral choice to make. In the movie the administrator who has to make the decision is shown to be a cold bitch who gives hearts to people with money. But, because of the impassioned valiance, and all that jazz, she finds a heart for the boy.  Given a situation with an older person with lots of money and a child with little money needs a heart, and we only have one to give, the tendency would be to give it to the kid. Our sympathy would lie with the child. We can find logical reasons for this though. First, the oldster has fewer years to live anyhow. He would get less use out of the heart. Second, older people are more likely to have incidental conditions that can contribute to less life and they would again get less use out of the heart. Third, the child has greater potential to contribute to the society. The older person has contributed more of his potential than the child so his loss will likely have less long-term impact than the loss of the child. When colored in this light it sounds cold and calculated, but I believe these considerations are examined, even if not consciously.  My examples are intended to show that we make distinctions between moral decisions. Consciously or otherwise, we assign weights to certain factors which in turn lead us to make a moral decision or judgment. When we make moral judgments we use a scale of wrongness. Is stealing a loaf of bread less wrong than stealing ten thousand dollars? Is giving the heart to the boy less wrong than giving it to the oldster? We make decisions like these every day, some people use a more logical means, some use a more emotional means but we still have a wrongness scale that guides us in making our moral judgments.  Westerners tend to believe that we are immoral creatures and that is why I say we use a wrongness scale. We aren’t trying to be moral, we’re trying to be less immoral. We must decide whether it’s less immoral to lie about our friend’s hairdo than to hurt their feelings, we decide that it’s less immoral to steal a loaf of bread than a bag of money, we decide which of our elective candidates is less bad than the others. Our Greek intellectual tradition tells us what we should pursue. Our Judeo/Christian tradition tells us where we stand in relation to our goal.  Morality is always colored in shades of grey. We are seldom faced with situations that are either right or wrong. There are almost always circumstances that might color our perception. So, we use our wrongness scale to tell us how to respond. We don't kill thieves but we do kill murders. We don't send people to jail for parking in the handicapped space, but we do drunk drivers. All of these things are illegal and immoral, but we weight them differently and assign different values on our wrongness scale.  Most of my examples have been both illegal and immoral, but that doesn't need to be the case. We use the wrongness scale all the time. We tease our siblings and make them angry. I don't think it's a very moral thing to do but it  is  fun. We eat grapes in the supermarket without paying for them. It's theft but not such that anything will be done. We read newspapers in the bookstore without paying for them. We fail to hold open the door for little old ladies. We do all manner of such things, but generally most people try to behave in such a way that these things are outweighed by the good things we do.  In a larger context, most of us measure our selves on a wrongness scale and try to tilt the scale towards the better side of things.  I finished writing this and am posting it because I just finished Life the Universe and Everything. It seems to sum it all up rather nicely. "We apologize for the iconvenience."

						   Summer blindsided me more than I expected. I'm taking scuba lessons, studying for my MCSE/MCSA, designing a website, working extra hours (I'm supposed to be gallivanting around the world right now, but I guess this fall or winter will be a fine time for a vacation), and catching up on my reading. So, my blog went to the back burner. A good while ago I said that I would be returning to a more normal blogging schedule, but it hasn't happened yet. Soon though. Real Soon Now.  I do have an excellent post written up on my laptop, maybe I'll go to the Hotspot later this afternoon and put that up. It's a follow-up to my post on moral relativism. I wrote it on my laptop and haven't managed to get it posted on the web yet. I can bug out of work early today since I'm working tomorrow.  Tomorrow I have to go to the dive center and rent my equipment for diving. I bought my mask, fins, snorkel, gloves, and boots; I have to rent my wetsuit, BCD, hood, and airtank. Next weekend I'll be going down to Monterrey for open water diving and I will then be a certified scuba diver.  I've been scuba diving and free diving and snorkelling a good few times and it's one of my favorite things ever. It's an odd adrenaline sport. It's relatively sedate and serene, but still a damn good work out and definitely gives you that rush. I think it's the curiosity factor. Scuba diving means exploring an entirely different world.  I read a blurb a little while ago about science fiction, and the writer questioned the vision authors have for their alien races. The general Sci-Fi alien is usually a bipedal critter not terribly far removed from humans. I guess in the world of motion pictures, it's much easier to create a humanoid critter than a super-intelligent shade of blue, but it doesn't seem to rhyme with what we see in our own world.  If you take a gander under the waves you see life forms that appear wholly unrelated to humans. Colonies of coral, sponges, tunicates, fish, shrimp, crabs, none of them appear to be even marginally related to humans until you dissect some of them or examine their DNA. A trip into the distant past gives us an additional glimpse of how differently life might evolve on other worlds. If we look to the cretaceous period, the world is dominated by giant lizard-like monsters, and a sprinkling of mammals. It looks nothing at all like the world we inhabit. Who's to say that one of them couldn't have evolved speech and intelligence equivalent to that of humans?  It's a fascinating thought and one I've considered fairly frequently.  I'm always somewhat disappointed in the aliens I find in works of science fiction.  The aliens in Ender's universe were properly alien.  The aliens in Star Trek looked like humans in costumes.  The Aliens in Aliens were . . . hungry? drippy? toothy? The aliens in Star Wars were somewhat more varied and interesting.  But they still seem to be the product of evolution in more or less earthlike conditions.  It is our only frame of reference, so maybe it's hard for us to imagine different forms that life could take, but coming full circle, you can  see  the different forms life might take when scuba diving.  None of the critters I've seen or read about in science fiction is as shocking or strange as those living under the water.  The colors and shapes and processes that one finds under the waves are more varied and wondrous than anything you can find on land, and what's truly amazing is that we can are distant cousins to these things.  And for all we know about life and how it works, we know almost nothing about these cousins, simply because their environment is alien to us.  They evolved here on earth before us and beside us, yet if we weren't able to see them first hand, we would never be able to imagine animals taking on the shape of a carnation coral, or an anemone.  So, that's what I like about scuba diving.  It's the closest I'm ever likely to get to exploring a different world.  It feeds my curiosity.  I can look at the startling colors of cold water ecosystems or the diversity of warm water systems, I can examine the plant life in fresh water, explore caves that haven't been in touch with the rest of the world for time out of mind, and every time I look, I will see something new, something I had never dreamed of.  It's not quite the same thing as setting foot on a different world, but it's damn close.
