       I got a lift into work today in a large (very large) people carrier. It was probably a 4-6 litre 16+ valve monster. Now, to me this type of vehicle is obviously aimed at large families (I mean large as in numerous, not necessarily fat). So why does it only have 2 doors. A 2-door people-carrier? Whose bright idea was that? By the way, has anyone told America that our supply of oil will be exhausted in 50 years. Unless you have 4 kids, there is no need for a petrol guzzling people carrier.

       I like places like Silver Spring and Bethesda. Trouble is, you can't actually live near the city centers. Most of the housing is a good 1/2 hour walk from the downtown, bars and restaurants. Why do this? Why not have smaller towns, each of which have own little area of entertainment. No-one should have to live more than 10 minutes from a bar. Someone should pass a state law...

       In terms of theatrical productions, DC should win easily over Belfast, and last night's production of Shear Madness proved it, by easily making it into my top five plays. Very witty, and very clever, with an unique improvised use of audience participation. It doesn't quite win over the best play I've ever saw - ' urlLink  Observe the Sons of Ulster'  , by Frank McGuinness at the Royal Opera House, Belfast. The other great plays in the top five include the recent Brooklyn themed Comedy of Errors at the Folger, and the Reduced Shakespheare's Complete history of the world.

       Went to see 'All the president's men' last night at the mall, in front of the Capitol building. I've never shared a movie with 50,000 people before. This is one area where DC beats Belfast, so congratulation to whoever organises these free showings.The atmosphere was friendly, the movie was good (although I can't imagine Bush was too impressed by the movie selection), and the rain stayed away. There was even a Road-runner cartoon at the start, what more is needed?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Genesis Ch1, Vs 8     And on the eighth day God created Saturday afternoon, and on this day man shall go to the bar, and drink alcohol. If a footie or rugby match is on then all the better, but if not, then there will always be crosswords to do, arguments to be had, and horse racing. Do not waste your Saturday afternoon completing frivolous tasks like cleaning the house, going for hikes, or working from home. For surely Saturday is a day of rest, to recover from the hangover of Friday night, and create one for Sunday morning.

       So what is up with people here. Everyone goes out on&nbsp;Thursday night, and Saturday night. But Friday nights are nearly dead. Why&nbsp;is Thursday so special?&nbsp;

       One of the big differences I've noticed since coming back is the lack of walking ethos in DC. In Belfast I could walk from my not-too-expensive house to my workplace in 5 minutes, then walk to a restaurant for lunch, walk to a bar after work for a few social drinks and then walk back home. Here you are lucky to get 2 out of the 3. Either you live near work, and have no bars nearby, or you live  near bars, and have to own a car to get to work.  Personally if I didn't have a few bars within 5 mins walk of my house I would go crazy. What do single people do in the evenings if they can't walk for a drink, have a good read of a newspaper and socialise?

       I walked up 18th street in Adams Morgan last night, hoping to find a good bar, with good music, where I could enjoy a few drinks and read a book. I've been told Madams Organ is good bars for blues music, but I've been in there about a dozen times now and still haven't heard any good blues. Blues music needs pain, and I just can't feel any in AM. Any suggestions anyone?  I've also noticed a dearth of single girls in bars; they are always in groups. Now I don't know whether this is just a safety thing, or whether they are embarrassed going into bars on themselves, but the only single girls I've saw are the barstaff (Ah! The barstaff, now there is a story for another post)

       I thought I would supply some background, so here goes.  I moved to DC in April 2004 to start a research post at NASA after completing my PhD at Queen's University Belfast. Although sorry I had to leave the wonderful city of Belfast, I was looking forward to starting a new life, and meeting new people. I found an apartment in Adams Morgan, sorted out furniture etc., and was soon settled in. It was actually quite easy to settle into my new life, as I knew I would be going back to Belfast for my graduation in June. Going back to Belfast was the best 3 weeks of my life. It was wonderful to be around so many familiar faces once more. But of course this meant that it was all the more difficult to leave.   Leaving Belfast on July 11 2004 was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. It was so much more final than last time. Sure, I see all my friends again, but it will never be the same. We'll never get back to the old days. I know this all sounds very soppy, and not very stiff upper lip British (I know I said I was Irish, but I'll get back to that one). But it has actually got me very depressed.   I'll soon get over this, I always do. But in the meantime, I'm going to post thoughts and stories about the past, and I hope then you'll understand why Belfast is such a special place, and why I find DC so strange.
