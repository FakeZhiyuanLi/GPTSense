      Working at Webelos Camp teaches you many thing that will help you out in later in life.  Embrace the differences in other people.  Their weakness maybe can let you show off your strengths.  Everyone at camp has a common goal.  The whole camp atmostphere is set around the idea of no I in team.  The best summers at Stearns is when everyone gets along, there is not division.  You are only around these people for 10 weeks.  Hate them on your days off, but love them on you days on.

      What started out as a stress relief turned into something more.  It began to take on a life of its own.  Something that was not suppose to have meaning, begat meaning.  It was a joke that soon no one was laughing at, even fat annoying Oklahoman chicks.  In under a year, it went from a project that was trying to maintain sanity in one of the most insane places, to a club that everyone thought they had to join.  Even the founding "non-members" lost sight of the project and starting toying with the idea of letting people join the non-existent club.  A heirachy was almost devised putting themselves at the top.  At the beginning of the third year of the project it took on a new role, an excuse.  "I can do this because I am part of the AP" some would say.  The AP became a center for the development of stress, instead of a haven from it.  The AP was never about inclusion, seclusion, exclusion, drinking, swearing, cement pigs, or anything else.  It was about being sleep deprived, mentally exhausted, overworked, under paid, and enjoying every minute of it.  Now begins the forth summer of which the AP exists.  I am sorry to inform everyone, the AP no longer exists, in fact it never did.  Actually, a better way to put it is that the point of it was never to exist.  This Frankenstein of an idea shall be put to rest.  Enjoy the summer, have your "Sex with Steve", destroy those bim rainflys, grunge the hell out of the camp, let your reservation directors smoke pot....I mean bitties, but the AP is gone.  You are not a member of it, it is not an excuse, it is not a reason.  It is nothing and should have stayed that way.

      I think the whole problem with our society today is that we favor intelligence over wisdom.  We have looked at the same problems over and over again and try to be smart to solve them.  Putting money into education won't necessarily make people smarter.  Society is changing and we need to adapt to its needs.  Boston is thinking about changing their high schools into more college like by letting students work at their own pace.  Maybe a good idea, maybe a poor idea, but atleast it is a new idea.  We are taught at a young age to color inside the lines and stay inside the box, but those people never become famous.  They never do anything spetacualr.  Stop thinking of ways to fix the system and maybe start thinking about ways to create a new system.  The box is there for guidelines and someplace to get started, outside is where the world awaits.

      Camp attracts winners.  Alot of the staff are real winners.  Adults that come to camp with their kids, they to are real winners.  I am both groups are a fairly balanced cross section of America.  (thats scary). I just notice dumb people more then i notice smart people.  Why cant people be smart?  Lets spend more money on education

      What is the point of Webelo Camp?  What should the focus be?  Should it be on the staff getting along and being able to do stuff outside of camp with the approval of Viking Council?  Should it be sitting around a dinner table eating "family style" to build more of a community of the staff?   Or...  Should it be about creating new and exciting program for the scouts?  Fixing the problems with the current program and make it better?  Should it be about wanting the Webelos think to themselves "I can't wait till next year at Many Point."  I hate the idea more than anyone, but Webelos camp should really be about selling the idea of Boy Scouts to the Webelos.  JP - Steve Stobbs is an awesome judge of character.  He knows Mike will bend over and take it up the ass and spew back all the bullshit to the staff that he wants done.
