      Yesterday I went to the drive in and saw the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" It wasn't that great. It had some good parts, but not worth all the hype it got. Anywyas at the drive in there were so many mexicans there so of course I was smelly the "mary jane" all night long. Man how I wish I had some of that right now. I wish I could get into it. Today I was out caughting bugs for my stupid bio project. It's so gay. I'm getting like an F on it. I know I will. I only got like 16 bugs out of 30. And only 1 week left. Atleast I don't have skool tomorrow. Also on friday my counceler was questioning if I should goto summer skool or not. She better say yes or I will be so pissed.  I saw a great japanese show today even though I forget what it was mostly about. But I do now it was great. The korean show I watch is on tomorrow. Also the one I watch Wed. and Thurs. I think it is ending soon. That will so suck. But a new one will come on. I hope it is just as good.  Just like 1 hour ago I saw this think on nostradamus. It was so crazy. All them predictions were like so close. I wonder what the future holds...

      First entry and nothing to talk about. I bet this blog gets like no traffic. Fuck!! O well, keeps me entertained. I just got a new digicam like last week. A cannon powershot A60. Cost me $200. Damn I barely had enough. Took my whole damn paycheck. Well atleast I will be able to produce a lot of pics.  I went to the so called "buddist temple" today. Fuck it looked more like a cult than anything. Also I don't even think it was a buddist temple. It just looked liked a church because I saw I big cross. Urg!! What a waste of time. Just a church that was gated. It looked freaky as shit though. Maybe I can think of something to do there at halloween.   I have started watching the mandrian show "Quest USA" great ass show. The first episode was on yesteday. The USA team has a hot ass girl. I actually found her blog. Man does she love to talk about sex. She is so kool with it. She seems so awsome. To bad i'll never meet her even though she lives close to me. I hope she will still blog often though because he some of her blogs were like in 2003. All but one I think.  Tomorrow I am going to see the movie "envy" It seems dumb but I have to go see it even though I don't wanna. I hope something comes up so I don't have to go. In School today I sucked on my math test. Damn!!! But I think I owned my japanese. I love japanese!!!わたしはにほんごがだいすきです.  I want to get some pictures of junk later.   さよなら
