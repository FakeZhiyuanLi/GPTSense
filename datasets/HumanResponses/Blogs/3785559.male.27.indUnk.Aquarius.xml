						   Well, after spending 13 hours yesterday doing McDonald's business, I came home to get some rest before another day of nothing but more McDonald's business.  You would have thought that my body at least would let me get away from the store for a few hours, but no.  Instead I spent the entire night working a shift, trying to figure out my new dream fry procedures that required us to take fries out of the vats with a skimmer an put them in a box with the same skimmer.  Don't ask me, but these are the things I dream about.  Anyway, I've spent the morning doing some more McD stuff, action plans, staff reward lists, and now I'm getting ready to start staff reviews and notices.  Later I get to go in to the store to do inventory.  I hate the end of the month.

						   Well, I'm going to try getting back into the habit of writing on this thing, due mostly to the fact that Rick got on my ass about not updating my previous blog in a while.  I can't remember my username from before, so I guess I'm just going to have to start over.  I'm sure that this won't be of much interest to anyone out there, but if it keeps Rick off my ass, then it's time well spent.  :-)  I spent most of my day off doing store business.  I'm coming to understand that this is the way it's going to be if I'm going to become the store manager.  First spent two hours finishing a manager's schedule that Del decided wasn't good enough, so he did one himself.  Now I get to redo the rest of the month that he didn't finish.     That's how things are going right now.  Spent my evening in the store doing a diagnostic to improve drive thru times.  While there, ended up talking with Del for a while and finding out that there was a meeting on Wednesday that no one else had bothered to tell me about.  And here I thought that we lived in a time where information flowed freely.  Again, that's how things are going right now.  I did get one chuckle today, however.  I was told that, while I am at a class pre-cert exam next week, Steven, who has 9 odd more years of experience but is technically 'assisting' me, will be doing the order and the schedule for the following week, but that I'm supposed to follow up with him to make sure it's done to my liking.  Wow, that's going to be fun.  :-)  Well, I'm actually getting tired early tonight for some reason.  Looks like it's time to put myself in bed and not be able to fall asleep.

						   Well, I'm getting ready for a pre-certification test that I have to take tomorrow in Pittsburgh.  I'm not looking forward to it.  I feel like I'm going to fail, which would really suck considering that Perla has already giving me rewards because I'm "Going to  pass it."  What a great surprise it'll be if I don't.  Heh.  I'm currently on a blistering pace for consecutive days of work.  Basing a day of 'work' as any day I spend time on the time clock, I've now been working for a personal best 10 straight days.  Given my schedule, it's going to be at least a total of fifteen days before I spend one day not "officially" working.  Yea!  Working on some final plans for vacation in my little spare time.  So far, the plans include a few days spend in Chattanooga, TN.  Kasey and I are also looking at possibly some time spent in Pigeon Forge, TN, and Charleston, SC.  If anyone has any suggestions as to places to see in the area, let me know.  As a side note, I found an interesting online test at  urlLink SparkLife .  It's a  urlLink gender test  that I simply had to take.  You have to sign up for an account, but it's free.  The test was 36% sure that I was a man without asking any questions about me personally.  Oddly enough, I too am only 36% sure I'm a man.  (The picture for me at the end of the test was a man in a dress.  Hmm.)  Well, back to studying.  I really hope I pass this exam.

						   Well, yet another entire day dedicated to McD's.  Now it's up to my brain to keep me occupied with the same overnight.  There's really nothing like getting out of bed, going to work, coming home and going right back to bed.  On the plus side, I think I might actually get to see Kasey tomorrow for more that an 30 minutes while not at the store.  But, that remains to be seen.

						   So, for 4 days now, both while awake and while asleep, I've been doing nothing but McD's stuff.  Almost every waking hour, except those that are dedicated to bodily functions like eating and, well, right, have been spend doing something for the store.  And for three nights straight I've been haunted by dreams of the place.  Last night, I was trying to do a bank deposit, but I couldn't get back to the office because I just  knew  there was a monster hiding out in the production area somewhere.  (This is about the 3rd time I've had this dream.)  So, now, I'm getting ready to go back in for more.  If I have a chance I'm going to pull to see how many hours I've put in this week, just for fun, then add on what I've done here while off the clock, and then add in what I've done here while sleeping.  You have to love being salaried.

						   Did I mention how much I hate doing inventory?  I dread the end of the month.  There is nothing more silly than trying to get an exact closing count of every single item in a store that's only "closed" for 2 or 3 minutes a day.  I'm turning into such a perfectionist and the imperfection of it makes me just want to pull someone's ears off.  On a side note, I actually did threaten to pull someone's ears off tonight.  Luckily it was an employee and I was joking.  There are two that I really do want to pull their ears off.  Actually, it would be more effective to my cause if I pulled their "bits and pieces" off, though, because they've decided to start going out now that they have started working together.  No matter where you put them, they end up migrating back together.  Put one in lobby and one in grill, they both end up in grill.  Put one on break and one on the floor, they both end up outside.   [sigh]   Well, another month down the drain.  I guess I should try to get some sleep.  The store is going to be super busy over the next four days.  The school across the street is hosting a four day long baseball tournament, so we're going to be drilled.
