      Hey everyone...I'm on a roll with updating, Scott you should be proud of me:) ...Anyways...didn't do to much tonight ..went out with the girls,&nbsp; it always makes me happy when we hang out cuz we're all so busy with work and such to spend time together and when we do it makes me happy:)  The single life is going pretty good...a lot easiier then I thought...I'm glad&nbsp;I haven't jumped into a relationship because I have soooo much shit to&nbsp; sort&nbsp;out.  Sure I do miss Chris a lot but maybe our breakup did happen for a reason? Maybe we weren't meant to be...it hurts to think that but each day its getting easier and easier...I'm realizing that I can have feelings for other guys and be comfortable around them and its cool, its like I'm like in Jr High with the whole "Crush" thing... Don't get me wrong I love Chris with all my heart and will forever but I think its time for me to move on...It's for the best for both of us and I think I will tell him that the next time I'm talking to him.   As I think about my choices I can't help but be &nbsp;reminded me of that poem I read in English class in grade 11, its something about two roads being divided into&nbsp;one and you pick the path you're going to take. I think this is the best path for me..  Anyways off that topic:) I work 12-6 tomorrow on cash , I better not be speedy or I will freak...Its so annoying and I can't stand some customers, They're so retarted.   Isn't it funny how all of a sudden we're done of highschool and all these kids who would never say one word to us all of a sudden decide to be nice and wave and have a chat with you? well im out  .

      Hey! Well let's just say I went to work cranky and came home happy:) The best news ever...I can't believe Elaines leaving next month, holy fuck thats amazzzzzing!&nbsp; I have never been so happy in my life I nearly pissed my pants when Linda told me.&nbsp; Its going to be weird having Beth doing Elaines job because she will be like my boss which is weird cuz we're related and all....awkwardness...well hopefully she will do a better job at the schedule:)  I've came to the conclusion that I'm a Shoppoholic..I seriously can not go more then a day without buying some sort of clothing or accesories. I gotta start saving my money for my stupid course and for a car and if i keep on spendin my money that means&nbsp; no future for moi so that sucks.&nbsp;   That would be cool if Andrea got the job at Movie Buffs, it would be perfecttttt....:)&nbsp; So this week is going pretty slow....lastnight wasn't that much fun, I picked up Chris and we drove out to Hillsbrah and drove Tommy and Sean to Stonerpark and a bunch of us just chatted it up...very unfun because their was too many little girls which I&nbsp; don't like and that Billy Wheeler guys annoyin as fuck and everyone was off in their little groups so screw that.  Soooo I don't think their is anything to do tonight, I should go and get my mom her b'day present, that shall be fun...She's so hard to get for...ugh that means I have to order her cake soon too...dammit..more money spent.  well im outta here   &nbsp;

      Hey everyone. its another wonderful sunday today..I hate sunday's, they shouldn't have been invented. everyone says its just to relax and lay back but I hate them. theirs nothing to do and noones home, coady and steve are gone to Moncton with Josh & Jade for the day, Andreas working and Sam's at Tylers:( I wish someone would call me but noone does.   I have tomorrow off which sucks because I probably will just stay home and do nothing, I'd rather be at work making some money but oh well:P My shifts are alright this week, a lot better then last weeek Tues 10-4 Cash Wed 8-3 Courtesy Thur 3-9 Courtesy Fri&nbsp; 12-6 Cash Sat 4-10 Supvise  I've came to the conclusion the reason why I am getting more cash shifts is because I no longer go out of my way to try and please Elaine, before I always was like all sweet and nice to her but now I don't care anymore. I don't think that I should have to please everyone anymore like I used to.  Once again you haven't called me, I think I might just say fuck it...you say you like me still but yet you rarely call me, only when you need something. I'm not going to bother calling you anymore, I think I may just move on..you&nbsp; were an important part of my life for the past few years but I'm realizing that I&nbsp;CAN actually live without you now, and maybe we aren't meant to be anymore. It breaks my heart to actually admit it but maybe it is good that we broke up, it seems you are more happy not being with me and I guess I might be too....ya sure I miss you a lot but I am only young and I have soo many years to find "the one" right? Maybe someday we will cross paths again and maybe we may have matured by then and then we can see what happens.   For whoever's reading this I'm sorry for all the shit I'm mumbling about:P but i always feel better after I let it all pour out:P and who knows, maybe noones reading this which is fine.  I want everyone to start leaving comments:P&nbsp;I fixed it now so everyone can leave them :P   Listening to: "Let Her Cry" -Hootie & the Blowfish

      Well&nbsp; what an adventure i had tonight...it &nbsp;was absolutue shit.&nbsp; I was soo confused on what to do and then I thought to myself how I just wanted to sit home and relax so I had it all planned to chill & relax then Chris S. called and said he was bored so went to Wal Mart and then rented a few movies. we watched this really fucked up movie, sam and I already saw it. Its about some psychopath who like kidnaps ppl and tortures them by pierciing their whole body and shit. It was crazzzzy.......  And now here I am..its 1:03 am and I'm so bored, I kinda wish I did go with Steve & them but I knew that if I went I wouldn't have a place to stay or anything if I had gotten drunk so that sucked. I worked 2-7:30 today, it was horrible..If i&nbsp; get more cash shifts im seriously leaving...fuck Elaine....Its so boring scanning groceries for six hours straight, I never realized how bad it was!! And some customers just piss me off because they're just so rude and ignorant, like I was on speedy today and this guy was like "Why aren't you baggin my groceries,Isn't it your job" and i was like "No, sir this is a speedy checkout and I have customers waiting in line" and he was like "this is ridicolous, you're useless" and I just smiled and nodded. Some people are just retarted. God im slowing hating work more and more everyday .....Its too I dont know? Sometimes its good to start over again at a new job , which I'm seriously thinking...Too much shit going on at Sobeys....  Noones talking to me on MSN, it sucks..I don't even know why I go on anymore...I can't wait to go to bed , it makes me happy...I could sleep for days and days but my parents won't let me because apparently I'm wasting my life away if I'm not up by 10:30 everyday which is retarted.   Blah I have nothing else really to talk about, I wonder who's actually reading this..ya must think that I'm fucked up or something :) ..well I'm gonna go now....see yas later...

       Hey, well I haven't written in this in a few days cuz nothing exciting has happened. Today was a pretty good day, went to Sobeys to wait for Sam to get off work and we drove Chris to get his hair cut and then we met up with Andrea and I went on an adventure at Suzy Sheir again. Tonight I got my tattoo done, it turned out really goood but it did hurt , it felt like it was taking forever but its cool. My moms not to happy about it and my dad doesn't really care so ya , my moms upstairs getting all pissed off but I don't care.    Anyways ya...lastnight was cool, went with the girls to _ _ _ _ _ and then we drove out to Hillsboroguh to see what was going on, little did we know that everyone was like on E 'cept for Steve and Jeff.&nbsp; Coady ended up coming with us for awhile and we all had a good chat......We love you Coady:) ....Chris S. picked me up at like 1:30 and we went back to his place and ended up sitting out on his drive way talkin to Joey fisher, Chris, Danny and a few other ppl. They were all really drunk.    Well anyways...its been like almost a month for me being single, its so weird.....I guess its a good thing for me ?? its a lot less hassle but it still sucks :(    This weekend is prolly going to succk , I wanna get drunk or something....maybe go out with Steve and them, hopefully the cops won't come this time.     &nbsp;  Well I dont know what else to say so i'll post again later    &nbsp;

       I thought I was over you for the final time until I saw you again, why are all these feelings come back again? Shouldn't I just say the hell with you and move on? or should I pursue something farther?   You're so hard to read..one day you're so sweet the next day you're so cold. Why do you do this to me, knowing that it hurts me so much...

       Hey everyone   Well I decided I should start this up again since it seems like I'm the only one not using this . My goal is to try and keep up on the postings unlike last time.  &nbsp;  This weekend was pretty fucked up. Friday after work Steve &amp; I drove out to Meadowbank to pick up Jeff Aulson, our friend from Boston. We picked him up becuz he was staying at Steves for the weekend. That night I went out their and we just walked around the whole night...Everyone was stoned out of their trees.....&nbsp;had a good chat with Cory B and a few other ppl. I went home at 1:30 and passed out on my bed.    Saturday I went to Steves to pick up Jeff and we went and woke up Coady and Tommy was already awake so we drove into town and went to Wild Impulse to get some Blunt Papers and then we stopped and picked up Steve for his lunch hour. After that I went home to get ready for work... &nbsp; Lets just say I never want to work another Saturday night again, stupid bitch Tara didn't show up so we were really screwed over. No cleaning was done what so ever so Elaine shall be happy with me Monday. &nbsp; After work I walked to Andreas work and we headed out to Hillsborough, met Kathy along the way so she followed us out and then Sam and Tyler came out too. We started drinking in some park and then the cops came so we got all kicked out of their.&nbsp; After that everything went downhill...Coady got a fine..The girls left....Steve freaked&nbsp; out at one of his bitch neighbours becuz she called him a drug dealer right in front of the cops so that wasn't good. &nbsp; After everything all settled down we ended up walkin up to the little building next to KFC on St. Peters Rd....I got the honours of babysitting Josh from work becuz he was totally loaded and making an ass out of himself...so thats what I did until like 2 when I decided to go home...'cept I had no money so I ended up calling Chris to pick me up,  &nbsp; So as you can tell I had quite an annoying weekend and everything just sucks now.....the one good thing is that Scotts&nbsp; back!! &nbsp; Well I think i wrote enought for this post...see yas later

      I'm staring at the computer screen with all these thoughts running through my head. I feel like everytihng is crumbling from beneath me and I can't do anything about it. I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore, I don't even feel like myself....its like a new me has appeared and I'm hating it. I wish things were the way they used to be....everything was perfect, life was looking good...Its amazing how quickly your life can be turned upside down. I guess things can never be the way you want them to be. Like I don't know why  im letting myself  be put through all this pain but its like I have nothing else to live for...I just want to get off this island and start over again, but theirs no such thing as second chances in life.  It seems like I'm drifting away from everyone so quickly...everyone is leaving my life and I hate it.

       Well I just woke up and it's 2:30, very surprised my parents didn't wake me up. So now I only have like ten hours left of the day so I'm happy. I don't know why I hate Sundays so much, I used to enjoy them. My parent's say its because of the accident I had, it was on a Sunday and apparently that makes me hate Sunday's which kind of make sense but their is absolutly nothing to do.       I'm listening to Everything by Lifehouse, its a really good song kinda depressing but its good. Lastnight was a pretty good night, me and the girls and mitch and tyler went over to Chris H's and drank a bit..went pretty good. Everyone got along so thats a plus :)   Todays my last day off til August 23,  I'm not really looking forward to working that much but since sam's going to be with me the whole time its cool so things will go by a lot faster.       Chris  called me today and asked me out to supper with him..I was like uh....I'm busy....I know thats rude and everything but I can't fall for him again, I don't want to go through that pain again. Thats why I don't call him anymore because the less I talk to him the easier it is to move on right?  He was surprised that I said no to him but he should understand, why the hell would he call me and ask if he could take me out to supper? God I hate guys.

       Well tonight I was flicking through the channels and I had this weird feeling in my brain that was telling me to turn to channel 12 and so I did and  and their was this ad looking for someone who has worked with special needs kids before and they were wanting the person to start in Sept. So I picked up the phone and called and I talked to the mother for a few minutes and it turns out she lives like 10 minutes from Summerside which sucks but I so would love to take the job.   I've been waiting for a job like this to come around and now that it's finally here I need to take it, I haven't told my parent's yet and they probably wouldn't be to happy about the whole distance thing but the it would be four days a week mon-thur from 9-6 which is pretty good.    She has an eleven year old son who was just diagnosed with Autism named Adam..I told her I would call her back on Friday and maybe set up an interview. I also gave her Ms. Perry Payne's number to as a reference.   Man if I did get this job this would be perfect. And as for being Full Time at Sobeys in the fall I might not take it if I decide to take this job because this is something that I have a passion for and I really don't care if I screw them over.      I know some of you probably think I'm a weird  for wanting to have a career in working with Special needs people but it makes me happy and this is my passion.   So I will keep yas all updated with this job thingy.

      I can't believe you would go to those extremes and say those things about me. and yes I did have fun with Danny and I didn't ditch you. You specifically said "we are doing something today" and I said sure until I got called into work til 8 so I didn't think we were doing anything since I thought u wnated to do something in the day time becuz u had some sort of family thing going on. Oh and by the way I'm not trying to prove anything, I don't expect for all of us to hang out as much anymore becuz we're busy with our lives and such. I'm not going to bother saying anymore cuz I'll prolly just end up saying the wrong shit so whatever.
