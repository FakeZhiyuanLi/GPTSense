      Okay, so you've seen the last effort which died ahead of target age (lasted a glorious ten days!!). Therefore to prevent similar disappointment I'm not going to set myself any ridiculously unachievable targets like three weeks this time!  I'm not particularly keen on the format of this blog, so it may well change shortly, we'll see.   So what's happened in the last six months? Well, unsurprisingly very little! Work at the same place, pretty much the same friends and same old routine. Have been working somewhat harder though and it looks like it's going to go unrecognised due to the company's ridiculously poor method of rewarding staff, and so i'm currently on the lookout for other stuff.   Still single and little progress on that front since last time. KH tried to manipulate me into trying to get back into my life but it didn't work. AB is still a no-no and there are little other options, particularly after a glorious crash-and-burn attempt through a friend of a friend. Checkout girl doesn't say much any more.  The aim of this blog is to just record thoughts and act as a reminder. Part of the reason i've started up again is because i was intrigued by some of my thoughts & feelings from six months ago, and was a little disappointed i didn't carry on. So if at any point i wonder why i should carry on, i should just look at this message. The aim is to:  a) record thoughts about personal life b) record feelings towards other people c) make observations d) remember things i was doing  Failing that I can ramble on about social inadequacy... :o)  If you are lucky (?) enough to stumble upon this page then please leave comments whether positive/negative. If I can remember how to setup links on the sidebar then i'll gladly reciprocate links for any visitors.  Cheers!

      Right, so second attempt here we come! Failed my first blog after two weeks, and haven't tried again for 6 months. You can view the old effort  urlLink here .  I'm giving it another go because I actually miss it in part and want to at least say I gave it a proper go, rather than the half-hearted effort of last time around.  So hold tight. It'll either be ground-breaking or a flop again!

      While i'm thinking away, now would be a decent time to explain the reason behind the name i've chosen for this blog.  It's lifted from a song by an artist named  urlLink Kathryn Williams , who just happens to be one of my favourite artists, but I felt that it was quite fitting. I first heard the song at the end of one of her albums as I was driving home from work about six months ago, and the lyrics stayed in the back of my mind because I familiarised with them to a certain degree.   The song is, I suppose, one of self-pity. I don't consider myself a self-pitiful person most of the time, but we all have it in us and I do, I'll admit, have a certain fed-upness about being single. Still. So that's where it comes from, and these are the lyrics to said song:  -----   now is the time to find out why you’re buying everything now is the time to find out why you sigh at everything you dress your self up to the top of your knickers and you smell so good it's like a box of chocolates   but no one takes you home no one takes you home   you’ve watched all the romance on the television it’s too much to bear you've got to get a new sort of vision you’ve done your best at the gym you've got your lip-gloss on you’re going to the doctors to see if it's a medical problem   cause no one takes you home no one takes you home   it’s breakfast its lunchtime its dinnertime spent with all those women’s magazines that tell you you’re not as fine as you look to yourself in the mirror in the morning when you smile to get yourself out of the door to give life why can’t life give you some more? cause no one takes you home

      Parents went away for holiday from today, and so for the first time in over three years I was blessed with a return to the experience that is shopping for groceries.  Not that i'd been waiting for this moment and counting down the months, weeks and days, because I wasn't, but I genuinely didn't realise (or remember) how much I enjoyed it. See, I used to be a serial shopper when I was flat sharing three years ago (for three years), which was easy with a supermarket right on your door. With an increased degree of independence today though I could browse at my own leisure and buy what  I  wanted.  For me . Incredibly self-indulgent, but you need to be once in a while.  So that was that. Filled up the fridge, and can live by fewer of other peoples' rules for the next 10 days or so, and more of mine.  Rule number one - the front door doesn't become Fort Knox. I find it curious how people can go on holiday for, say, 2 weeks, and lock their front door by way of key only. Yet when they're on the inside they insist on key locking it, deadlocking it, putting the top & bottom restraining locks on, and clipping on the security chain. Why the hell why?!!! Madness.
