      sorry it's taken me so long to add a new post everyone! i had the most fuckin' awesome time last week~ went to the Regal theatre and watched a performance of a lifetime! Bar @ Buena Vista.  when i think of Cuba ~  famous in the 20th century for communism, Che Guevara, cigars, missiles and Latin music! don't mean to get theoretical but  a bloke by the name of Ry Cooder reintroduced the world to Cuban musicians in ?1997? when he released a CD called Buena Vista Social Club! fucking mind-blowing - the album won a grammy. it's one of my fave chill out albums to listen to. i've also watched a documentary recently with the same name that profiled these musical legends.   urlLink    fuckin awesome~3 thumbs up!  urlLink      i've always thought this is stuff i'm only able to read about and listen to. BUT, last week i've had a chance to experience these legends in the flesh! how fucking kewl is that!? it's like being teleported into another dimension. it's so bloody surreal! felt like i was in a Havana club of the 50s.     the ensemble featured Luis Frank, Carlos Gonzalez(Buena Vista Social Club), Compay Segundo, Sierra Maestro, Odelkis Reve (the Afro Cuban Allstars). *the kewlest senoir citizens i have seen* 86 year old singing legend Reynaldo Creagh, 82 year old pianist Maestro Rubalcaba, 75 year old Maraicaibo on tres guitar and diva Siomara Valdes.  for those of you who are unaware, some of the original members of Buena Vista Social Club have passed on but their spirit is still going strong!! strong enough to overwhelm me and make me part with $35 for an understated T-shirt. plain red Tee that has a plain print on the front~Bar @ Buena Vista.  (daylight robbery) this is my only regret on that faithful day!     urlLink    proof of purchase.  urlLink      there's something about Latin music that drives me wild.  maybe cause it's sung in Spanish. Espanyol to me, is the official language of love! i don't care what the French think!  "El Cuarto de Tula" is my fav song on the Buena Vista Social Club album. i dunno what it means but my insides melt into a pulp evertime i hear it. there is this song on the album about someone's house catching  fire. "Candella" i think it's called. the vocals/music sound so happy! how could it be so cruel?  i used to secretly wish i'd marry a Spanish speaking heart throb. i'd imagine having a heated argument.........oh! i would be extremely forgiving irregardless of how heinous his hurling of verbal abuse to me in Spanish may be! Aaaaahhhh! Bring it on!! Speak Spanish to me baby!

      Holy Guacamole!!  my parents celebrated their wedding anniversary today.  i've never been the sort who gives a fuck about Valentines day and all that lovey dovey stuff... but strange, i do think wedding anniversaries are Xtremely special. the day U decide to commit Urself to this one individual for the rest of Ur life is HEAVY SHIT for me. 'commit' is a word that is only used&nbsp;with regards to a&nbsp;mental institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;U'd have to be madly in love and i do mean CRAZY enough to sign a contract to be faithful in spite of what lies ahead......   below is a picture of my parents and me taken @ Hard Rock Cafe K.L. my papa was performing at HRC for a couple of months.&nbsp; it was the very last photo we've ever taken together!&nbsp; ignore the white&nbsp;dude in the background......oh! yup!&nbsp;this pic is&nbsp;one that i took not long after i shaved my head- just in case Ur wondering............&nbsp;    urlLink     happy family @ Hard Rock Cafe K.L&nbsp;   my moms'&nbsp; had 2 failed marriages. they say the 3rd times a charm- i suppose so. everyone said it wouldn't last, just like the other 2 marriages. i'm proud to announce, my papa + mummy are still wildly and passionately in love with one another as the day they were married&nbsp;many years ago!   i do wish someday that i would be lucky enough to&nbsp;Xperience the same. everytime i fall madly in love, it's only a matter of time before i realize everyone has a different way of embracing the concept of love.&nbsp;i've yet to find someone who shares and feels the same as i. then&nbsp;the passion and love&nbsp;fizzles out a little, while i lay baffled, frustrated and confused.&nbsp;i grew up witnessing what love should be like. i know fairy tale romances are not impossible.   &nbsp;it sickens me whenever someone tells me " it's natural to fall out of love "-"  familiarity breeds contempt "- that " feelings fade away with time "."  it's normal for married couples to reignite the flames of passion every once in a while "............*BULLSHIT* my parents are living proof that everyday can be Valentines day....................it's there for the taking----if U want it!&nbsp; i reeeeaaally want it!&nbsp;i &nbsp;hope to find it sometime soon! wish me luck everyone!&nbsp;hee!hee!hee!&nbsp;

      i went on another day trip on thursday......this time to New Norcia, Australia's only monastic town. my blog's beginning to look like a Western Australia tourist promotion website huh? :) can't help it guyz, i'm still on skool holidayz. it's awesome that i get to skate alot more, but it's also&nbsp;heaps of fun doing these day trips.  &nbsp;  i've decided to miss out on visiting my grandad and unkle over east. been trying to save some money for either~a 2nd hand car or brand spanking new scooter.&nbsp;don't wanna feel like i've wasted my holidayz, so these inXpensive trips fill this need. no regrets! New Norcia was beautiful! so peaceful......    urlLink     ME in front of St. Abbey church&nbsp; urlLink      first learnt of New Norcia from the label on a loaf of bread i've recently enjoyed eating. there's&nbsp;supposedly&nbsp;a bakery&nbsp;in the monastery of New Norcia. all this while, i thought the monks baked the bread.&nbsp;it made&nbsp;my 'bread eating' Xperience a lot more special for me. i'd imagine the monks in their habits covered in flour with every bite i take. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Alas, they don't! i've been fooled! creative packaging .......bloody merchandisers! doesn't matter though~ it's a gem of a town. there's a Spanish/Latin flavour and feel to the architecture at New Norcia.&nbsp;that's cause the pioneering benedictine monks of New Norcia&nbsp;are from Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp;the picture u see of St. Abbey above is used&nbsp;as a logo for the sourdough bread i love so much..... yummmmmmmmm&nbsp;    urlLink     interior of St. Gertrude's church&nbsp; urlLink      i'm athiest......eventhough i was born and raised as a muslim. religions don't do anything for me! recently however, i've been sucked into Catholicism. it probably started 4 years ago&nbsp;in Rome @&nbsp;the Vatican city. Basilica di San Pietro took my breath away. U won't believe me but i&nbsp;shed a tear against my will&nbsp;when i walked into this massive, impressive structure! never felt such calm in my life.&nbsp;as a matter of fact, every single church i've&nbsp;gone into&nbsp;in the U.K and Europe, made me feel this way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  the prayer rooms and 3 churches at New Norcia are no Xception. nothing compared to St. Peter's&nbsp;basilica obviously!&nbsp;nevertheless such serenity, bliss, peace and quiet. if only our lives were like the interiors of these churches..........the world would be a better place. i really think so!!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink     interior of St.Ildephonsus' church&nbsp; urlLink      sorry the pics aren't all that clear cause&nbsp;most churches are dimly lit. U&nbsp;can imagine&nbsp;what it's&nbsp;like to&nbsp;meditate in prayer&nbsp;whilst&nbsp;kneeling before the Lord&nbsp;in&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the aisle seats&nbsp;right?&nbsp;U don't get this in Singapore. most churches face rapid modernization back home. everythings so sterile, fake, plastic, industrial, metal, contemporary, bright, yucks! U just wanna say Ur prayers and bail A.S.A.P!! what has become of this world?? not that i'm against progress but i hate these changes.....sometimes old is beautiful. i'm sure U get what i'm trying to say....    urlLink     ebony switched with ivory ~ subliminal message maybe??&nbsp; urlLink      an interesting find @ New Norcia is probably the&nbsp;organ in the monks' prayer room. the guide&nbsp;claimed that they were short of ivory in the early 80's so they used ebony instead. white is black. black is white.....isn't that beautiful??&nbsp;i know my papa + MiOw would love to Xperiment + jam on this organ! ;)  &nbsp;  about the keyz, i just think some radical punks or S.H.A.R.P came into town that day and made a statement. ha!ha!ha!&nbsp;Down with racism!! it could be true cause according to my mum, racism was rampant then. in this day and age, it's 'cool' to be politically correct. go figure! the monks were probably punk @ heart......they did what no other 'white' Australian wouldn't do back then.....they welcomed the aboriginals into their monastery with open arms. respect!  &nbsp;  *interesting to note* that PAX is the motto of the benedictine monks of New Norcia. PAX is a Latin word meaning peace. bought a PAX patch in support of the monks......they fuckin ROCK!!  trying to decide what i'm gonna sew this patch on to.&nbsp;till then....PAX out everyone!!&nbsp;

      One of my bestest friendz in the whole wide world celebrated her birthday last week...happy B-day to ya MiOw! i was not there with her physically, but "My gawd!" i was thinking bout her all day. felt really crummy cause i waz in a foul mood all week. i didn't wanna ruin her happy, happy B-day vibe with my misery. big mistake. how could i have been so selfish??...the world does not evolve around me. i'm aware of that, so i'm really, really sorry princess. on Ur B-day, these pictures kept me company. i suppose it's just a natural process that happens cause all the memories we shared together, good & bad just flowed through my thoughts.....     urlLink    MiOw & me back in our art studio 6 years ago??&nbsp; urlLink     Can U imagine we've been friends for over 6 years now? MiOw is an Xtremely talented woman. i love her artistic vision. she's got an amazing character. i said to her once that if i were a guy, i'd ask her to marry me! that's how cool she is. we were so 'tight' back in art college. Whoaa! we had some misadventures then huh?? Rudy, Din, Andrew, Irene and the rest of the 'freaks' i'm sure feel the same way bout U. stay that way babe!       urlLink    from left~ Irene, MiOw & me&nbsp; urlLink     weren't we supposed to go to Japan, the 3 of us?? we alwayz settle for these other *sucky* short trips at the last minute, we should plan....what would U both think about going to Japan at the end of the year?? if not, there's always Redang, Malaysia again?? we were supposed to go to K.L as well right? can't wait to be back to make new adventures guyz!! this time, let's make this trip really, really BIG and unforgettable! the best we've planned....whaddaya say? anyone else wanna join us?     urlLink    MiOw waz the only person who thought i looked cute with braces on........that i think is weird!&nbsp; urlLink     nevertheless, there are no words to descibe my friendship with this gal. i'm a lucky girl cause i've got really, really great friends. some people search all their lives for that one true and lasting friendship. it didn't take me that long to discover my friends. the thing about friendship is that U feel it right in the gut, i suppose just like true love, U just know it'll last forever. i hate being sentimental and all, but bear with me for i'm at a strange turning point in my life facing realization after realization. i just wanna appreciate and savour the fact that MY FRIENDS ROCK!   MiOw, i wanted to do a crap - ass tribute for ya in here, but we both know U deserve better......for now, let's raise our drinking glasses and make a toast to one the most awesome individuals that i have been priviledged to know.......my princess MiOw! I LOVE YA MiOwie! *muak*muak*

      i'm in such a shitty mood today... feel like fuck. was scrolling down my Favourites list while on the net and accidentally clicked on a link i thought i'd deleted. it was an online journal that belonged to 'someone i once knew'- my classmate in Film + TV. remember the *bullshit* rumours that reached my mom in Singapore?.... some of it was related to this friend. apparently he's toying with my emotions and that all he wants to do is just fuck me! (like anyone would seriously want to!) allegedly, he is pretending to be my 'genuine' platonic new best friend.   Last that my mom heard, was that this guy and myself had this huge fight....we broke up??!! what the......!? none of the above is true! it isn't! at first, i thought all this bullshit was so funny! couldn't wait to share it with him and laugh it off! meanwhile, i defended him right till the end! spent so much energy defending him!...  i began to question if he would do the same for me? i couldn't find an honest answer to that. he probably realizes and considers me more of a former classmate than a soulmate or bestmate in spite of what words were Xchanged between us. i just ask myself constantly~ is all this energy worth the heartache? it seems as though i'm investing alot more emotionally than him.    urlLink    i look like SHIT! if  Joey Ramone had a fraternal twin sista, she'd look just like me now! earwax: song for today is...... 311 ~ lovesong. the original  version is done by the Cure &nbsp; urlLink     honestly, i cannot deny that there is that special something between us. it was the same feeling i got when i realized Irene + MiOw + Kenji were special to me. i LOVE them to death! i dunno why i got angry @ first! then i became depressed. i cried alot. then i became angry again... i was irrational cause i sent this friend an e-mail stating we shouldn't be friends anymore. it's probably the biggest mistake i've made in a very long while. but the e-mail really wasn't directed at him. there's been an invasion of privacy in both our lives. someones broken into and has been reading our e-mails. i think more mine than his. so the angst was directed at the guilty party!     i don't know what i was thinking at that time. all i could think of was the fact that my papa is this public figure in Singapore...now more than ever with stupid Singapore Idol......YUCKS! what is happening to me???  FUNNY! i never used to care bout what people had to say bout me and the people i love. everyone knows that i would actually spite them on purpose and do the Xact opposite of what they Xpected of me. my parents are kewl bout this nonsense. they think i take it to hard. my mom actually regrets telling me in the first place- says i get too EMO. we made a pact to never talk bout this ever again.    urlLink    ....i hate this pic, so ugly + morbid! but it accurately depicts my true feelings.....&nbsp; urlLink     my long lost friend ~ he's in a very happy 'place' right now - touring with his band over East. if he's happy, i'm happy for him. wish thingz weren't so complicated - we could be friends again. gosh! i really, really miss him. i really miss all my friends!  :(   I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE ALONE THAN I DO RIGHT NOW........

      Accidentally discovered this sk8 park in Northam. i couldn't believe my eyez! this beauty was left derelict in some scummy ghetto area of town. it's not clear in the pics, but the area is BAD! no wonder - not many sk8ers! what a shame ~ it's like an oasis in a barren desert! i saw some sk8ers on the main town strip though. a sk8 scene does Xist! perhaps 'street' is the preferred choice. perhaps poseurs get beaten the crap out off.(lol) perhaps! perhaps! perhaps!       urlLink    R.A.P (respect all people) sk8 park&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    the other view of sk8 park&nbsp; urlLink     BTW i'd like to give a shout out to Josh & Matt! my new found sk8er friends from Northam. thanks for accepting me as an equal opportunity sk8er. this means alot to me that U've overlooked the fact i'm a girl! SK8ERs RULE! hope to catch up with you boiz when Brandon gets posted to Toodyay! YaY! cheerz guyz!   urlLink    heaven is a halfpipe!&nbsp; urlLink

      Yesterday, i went to Toodyay. it's a quaint little town an hours drive out of Perth city. Brandon accepted a teaching post @ their district high skool next semester, so we were on a reconnaissance mission.    urlLink    The Avon river in Toodyay ~ this is where the action of the Avon descent takes place each year in August. &nbsp; urlLink      Toodyay is pronounced~ two jay. has a population of approximately 4000 residents. i know! HUGE town! ha!ha!ha! been there once so i know what to expect. Brandon + his mom however :P ..... i did warn them. There's probably a 400m strectch of shops in the main town strip.~~ Orchard Rd/ Hay street mall? far from it! i instantly thought of 2 people- Nasrie & Irene. My top notch shopoholic friends who would probably hang themselves out of boredom and having to put up with such outdated fashionistas. imagine them screaming on the top of their lungs, "Omigawd! Quickly, somebody call the fashion police!"   urlLink    Toodyay sleeps ~ 85km North-East of Perth &nbsp; urlLink      went to their Coca~cola cafe/museum in town. Crappy! it's just some guy who collects Coke memorabilia and decided he'll display them @ his cafe. don't get me wrong! i do love the tranquility and beauty of the countryside. went camping & bushwalking the last time i was there, LOVED IT so much! didn't do any of that nature stuff this time round so i had a crap time!    urlLink    Toodyay Coca Cola museum = Coca Crap! thank gawd they don't serve that other crap soda...p***i!&nbsp; urlLink      overall, i'd say this day trip Xperience is similar to meeting a 'bimbo'?? scenery is stunningly beautiful but lacks real substance. nice but forgettable! i am nasty aren't i? *wish Irene, MiOw & Kenji were there* i'd have a better time, i know it!..........

      i've been a strong advocate and promoter of the lion city music scene. naturally, my papa is the frontman for 9 lives (formerly Energy), a rock band in Singapore. *me so proud!* So you can imagine the role music plays in my life. i grew up with this! think i would be dead in a ditch somewhere if someone told me i can't listen to music. it is the very air that i breathe. therefore, it is pertinent that i shamelessly promote a band from Singapore every once in a while. bear with me please *grinning with pride!!* :D     so attention:ladies & gents, boiz &amp; grrrlz...........       give it up for the trust fund rockers!      there are many definitive bands behind the Lion city music scene. Force Vomit to me is one of the more important band on the evil, evil island of Singapore. read this review (even if it's outdated) + *very important* pleeease listen to  urlLink  Spacemen Over Malaysia   . i LOVE this track! spacemen+space probes=kick ass combo (i fuckin like!) this is the first song i've heard from them many yearz ago. i remember Dino saying it's inspired by a B-grade $0.50 comic book with the same title.                urlLink    kudos to force vomit !  urlLink
