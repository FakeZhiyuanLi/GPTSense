      I saw the headlights in the driveway and my heart leapt into my throat.  “Is this really happening?” I thought.  I told him to come in through the side door so he wouldn’t have to ring the bell.  The dog would get too excited.  I was sitting in the kitchen.  He walked in and I stood up.  He looked at me.  I looked back.  He walked across the room and as he approached me I felt a surge of emotion – passion and longing and excitement combined.  There were no words.  He grabbed me and kissed me hard.  I felt weak.  The tension had built up for so long that the intensity of the kiss was overwhelming.  I knew he felt it too.  We stumbled into the living room as we continued to kiss.  We fell on to the couch.  The leather was cold but it felt good against my hot skin.  I was underneath him.  My dress had ridden up and I tried to pull it down.  He grabbed my hand and stopped me.  “No,” he said, “I want to feel your skin.”  His voice was trembling.  I felt warm and nauseous.  He grabbed the back of my thigh and pulled my leg around his waist.  Then he slid his hand up the back of my leg, around my left buttock and down between my legs.  “You feel good,” he whispered.  I couldn’t speak.  I could barely breathe.  He licked my lips and his tongue slid into my mouth.  He was tasting me.  I moaned and stretched my body out so that I could feel my whole body against his.  He pulled open the top of my dress and licked the sweaty space between my breasts.  “You taste so good,” he panted.  I was still speechless, unable to think.  All I could do was feel him.  I felt his whole body on top of me.  I felt his hands caressing my body and making me wetter and wetter.  I knew he wanted me too, and I was pleased with what I felt when I wrapped my other leg around his waist and tilted my hips up to meet his.  I could only communicate with my body.  He heard me and he slid both of his hands up the backs of my thighs again, grabbing my ass and pulling me toward him.  “You’re naked under this dress,” he said with mock disapproval.  A throaty laugh escaped from my mouth without me even thinking.  All of a sudden he pulled me up as he sat up.  I was now straddling his lap, facing him.  With his hands still under my dress, he pushed the dress up and pulled it over my head.  My breasts bounced out of the dress and he grabbed them, slowly licking my nipples as they hardened from the cold air.  Suddenly he bit down on my nipple and I shuddered with pleasure.  How did he know just what made me hot?  I wanted him naked.  I wanted to fuck him right there on the couch in my parents’ living room.  They weren’t coming home.  I was house-sitting for the weekend.  They would never know, but every time I looked at that couch I would know that I had fucked him right there on the cool, soft leather.  I arched my back, tilting my hips forward and rocking against his body.  I offered up my breasts to his mouth as he continued to lick and nibble.  His hands slid down my back and pulled me closer to him.  I started to fumble with the buttons on his shirt but I had lost my fine motor skills.  In a moment of abandon I ripped his shirt open and pulled it off him.  “Hey,” he laughed, “I liked that shirt.”  We paused for a moment to chuckle at the cliché, our eyes meeting in a conspiratorial embrace.  If I thought about it too much it became uncomfortable, so I surged forward, riding a wave of sexual tension that had been building for months.  I leaned forward, pressing my torso against his.  His body felt soft and hard at the same time.  Not taught, but not doughy either.  As I pressed against him we began to sweat – a dry sweat that comes not from exertion, but from intense internal heat.  I lowered my head to his and, with my mouth parted slightly, kissed him deeply.  I ran my tongue around the inside of his lips as he pulled me even closer to him.  He let out a slow, low moan that sent a wave of arousal through my body.  He pushed me onto my back, running his hands up the inside of my thighs.  He touched his tongue to my clit, making me gush with excitement and anticipation.  Running the length of his tongue over my cunt, he brought a flush to my entire body.  Groaning with pleasure, I ran my fingers through my hair and relaxed completely, letting him lick me to the edge of oblivion.    Then came the inevitable exchange of two twenty-somethings who are single and sexual.   “Do you have any?,” I asked urgently, reaching into his pocket, where I hoped to find a condom.  I found one, but not before grazing the length of his penis with my fingertips.  He groaned, almost growling, “I want to fuck you.”  Not wanting to wait, I managed to get his belt unbuckled, unzipped his pants and slid onto the floor.  After taking off his shoes and socks I quickly pulled on his trouser legs.  Aching, I put the condom on him.  As I straddled him again I decided to tease him, placing just the tip of his penis inside me.  He tried to thrust deeper, but I pulled away, not wanting to lose the feeling of anticipation that had built up until now.  Groaning with frustration, he pulled me forward and I slid down the length of his cock until it was completely in me.  At that point my mind ceased functioning and my body took over completely.  Everything about him felt good.  I rocked forward and back, not allowing him to control the speed, but setting a slow, rhythmic pace.  Finally, I leaned back, resting my hands on the edge of the couch seat and clenched him tightly with my muscles.  I felt a wave of intense pleasure as I started to come.  Opening my eyes, I could see that he was feeling it too.  I started to pant and moan, as did he.  As we came together, I felt a tinge of guilt, knowing that we had let our bodies control us without thinking about the consequences.  As we parted, and slumped, spent, on the couch he asked me, “Why am I here with you tonight?”   I answered, “Not everything has a reason.”

      Today is one of those days that makes everything more beautiful than it normally looks.  There’s a quality to the light.  I could float away on the cherry blossoms that line the street like the remnants of a parade.  Today is a day for dreaming.  But not real dreams – real dreams are wishes unfulfilled.  Today is a day to enjoy music for each chord; to revel in the twang of a blues guitar; to look at parts of the whole – the best parts of the whole.  The big picture is sometimes too big.  I am overwhelmed with love.  I give it to many people, but I’m really saving most of it for THE FUTURE.  The future is not a point in time, it’s a state of being.  My whole life exists for what will happen in the future.  What will the future bring – love, fulfillment, personal success, happiness?  Every night I go out to search for the future.  So far I know that future can not be found at the bottom of a martini or in the bed of a casual lover.  The future is not in my mother’s affection or the way my friends love me.  But, today, my life is the small things.  Today I can sit for hours in the sun with my friends.  These are the people I love.  We don’t even have to talk, but we do because we love each other and we want to hear the voices that we so seldom get to hear in person.  I look at each of their faces and see eyes that know.  There is silent comprehension and outward compassion.  We have THE PAST.  The past is not a point in time, it’s comfort.  We are the past and the past is present.  They know my real dreams and they believe.  Today reminds me that there are people I can run to when THE FUTURE seems unattainable.  You are not the present or the past.  You are a dream.  You do not exist.  Today is not for you.  But you are still there to remind me that I am alone; that the future hasn’t happened yet.  Everyone wants me to find you.  As I look at the sparkling diamonds I see inhabiting so many of my friends’ fingers, I think of you and wonder what is taking you so long.  I think about you every time my mother wishes for a grandchild.    I worry that I’m not finding you because I’m looking in the wrong place.  Like when you lose your keys and then you find them 2 days later in the coat of the pocket where you were sure they couldn’t possibly be.  What if I never find the coat?  What if I take it to Salvation Army and some other woman buys it and finds you in the pocket?  On a good day I think you will be like the 20 dollar bill that I found in the street once.  You are just about to get picked up by the wind and float away but I’m going to grab you before you fly into the street and stick to the window of a passing taxi cab.  I definitely need you more than the taxi driver needs you.  So I wander the streets looking for $20 bills.  And, let me tell you, there are not a lot of $20 bills on the streets in Baltimore.  Where else can I look?  I didn’t find you in my last man, who pretended to love me until he could find a way out.  I haven’t found you in any of the many bars I’ve frequented, although I have eliminated many people that way.  You’re not at the gym or the art museum.  You obviously don’t like the same music as I do because you aren’t at any of the shows.  I haven’t looked in the tourist traps, but I don’t think you’re there.  You’re a hometown guy.  I keep reminding myself that today is good.  These people – my friends – love me like no one else in the world.  But they don’t love me like you do.  You had better hurry before I give all my love away.  It’s leaking out slowly, like air from a deflating tire.  I want to keep it for you, but I can’t hold it in.

      Ok, so I know I'm a little behind with the falling in love with Ryan Adams thing, but this is my new favorite song.  Imagine sexy yet sullen harmonica in the background.  When they call your name Will you walk right up? With a smile on your face? Or will you cower in fear In your favorite sweater With an old love letter?   I wish you would I wish you would   Come pick me up Take me out Fuck me up Steal my records Screw all my friends They’re all full of shit With a smile on your face And then do it again  I wish you would   When you’re walking downtown Do you wish I was there? Do you wish it was me? With the windows clear and the mannequins eyes Do they all look like mine?   You know you could I wish you would  Come pick me up Take me out Fuck me up Steal my records Screw all my friends behind my back With a smile on your face And then do it again  I wish you would   I wish you’d make up my bed So I could make up my mind Try it for sleeping instead Maybe you’ll rest sometime  I wish I could      HOT HOT HOT

      Ok, so this happened a while back, but it was so entertaining, that I had to share.  All parties will remain anonymous, but if you read this and it sounds familiar it's probably about you.  So, being the adventurous and socially inept woman that I am, I signed up for Nerve.com personals.  I thought that by choosing nerve -- the sexxxy hipster online dating service -- I would be thinning out the ranks a bit.  So, when I got an email from a cute guy who was a bit older than me, but very cute nonetheless, I was excited.  Ok, let's be specific.  He was 15 years older and he looked like Peter Gallagher (now of "The OC" fame).  We talked on the phone.  Here's how a portion of the conversation went:  Him: "I'm in the music entertainment business."   Me: "What's music entertainment?" H: "You know, music entertainment." M: "No, I don't." H: "I do private parties." M: "Oh, so are you a DJ?" H: "Yes, well I own my own DJ Service."  At this point I'm wondering what a DJ service is and thinking that it really involves having a 1-900 number that people call and they have someone sing songs to you until you come or something weird like that.  So, despite the fact that he was a glorified party clown, I agreed to go on the date anyway.  I should have known when he said that he didn't like going downtown to go out "because I can never find a parking space" that I was in trouble.  I live in fucking Baltimore for pete's sake.  There has never been a parking shortage in this city.  Well, maybe once, when the Pope was in town, but come on.  So, I drove out to what I'll generously call "outer Baltimore" to a terrible bar that has a reputation for being the place where your Uncle used to hang out when he was a swinging single in 1962.    I walk in -- about 10 minutes late -- and he's standing in the middle of the bar so he can see the door.  I see him and smile.  He comes up and gives me a hug -- not a "Hi, how are you?  I just met you" hug.  A full body contact hip-to-hip hug with back rubbing.  Since he has already staked out two stools and purchased a selection of beers, we have no choice but to sit down.  But, before I sit he says, "No wait." and grabs me by the hand.  He then proceeds to twirl me around like we are dancing.  At this point I am still trying to be open minded, so I go with it, thinking he's just being festive.  THEN he tells me that was a test because he doesn't like women who can't go with the flow.  Ok, strike one.  We sit and almost automatically he takes my hand and stares deeply into my eyes.  AS IF WE ARE LONG LOST LOVERS.  Ridiculous, right?  So, then, about 10 minutes into the date he asks if he can kiss me.  Strike fucking two.  First of all, when you are asked to be kissed, the kiss is almost never good (someone please prove me wrong here).  Second, I barely know him AND we are in a public place.  But, I say yes anyway because I'm curious.  It was not a good kiss.  We talk for about another 30 minutes as I try to think of a reason why I would have to go to bed at 8pm on a Thursday.  I can't think of one.    Throughout the date he continues to touch me and rub my arm and smile goofily without talking.  At one point he actually puts his leg in my lap.  Yes, that's what I said.  Totally without pretense.  Just half straddles me.  Strike three, you're out.  Right?  Except no, because I am too damn nice.  So, when he asks if I want a tour of his place, which just happens to be 5 minutes away, I say yes.  (I know, it was stupid, but I had a cell phone and a car.  I thought it would be fine.  Plus, I was really excited to see the southwestern themed "rockstar" living room that he had been bragging about.)  So, we go to his place.  OH MY GOD.  The Southwestern Rockstar living room is nothing more than a room with recessed ceiling lights, painted a deserty color, and occupied largely by a hideously patterned couch that I guess could be construed as Southwestern.  Not to mention the fact that he had speakers (for music) in his bathroom.  This was not a cool, sleek, sound system that you could hear through speakers built into walls all over the house.  This was a shelf over the toilet with speakers in it.  Needless to say the date didn't last much longer.  We sat in the rockstar living room and chatted a little more.  He asked me to dance to Billy Joel, and then I pretty much bolted without looking back.  The best part of the story is that I met up with some guy friends of mine after the date, who made me feel better about the whole thing and gave me the helpful advice that I should "Go on more dates, just with nice guys."  Rocket scientists, the lot of them.  But what can you do?

      Sometimes, when I'm in the shower, I think about you.  It used to be that these shower thoughts would turn into shower tears and shower sobbing.  I would remember the whispers and the tacit understanding of things to come.  I would feel lonely and depressed.  The shower is really the best place to cry because no one will notice the tears when you get out.  Much better than the time I started crying on a city bus because I saw a woman's purse that had your name embroidered into it.  Your full name -- a reminder that I no longer had you, but another woman did.  I thought the terrible memories of our painful parting would last forever.    Lately, however, they have turned into shower laughs.  I laugh about the fun things that happened when we were friends.  How you were capable of giving almost anything a sexual connotation.  How funny that was, and later how sexy.  I remember thinking of you as one of my first good guy friends.  You taught me to love heavy metal and classic rock.  I remember being intimidated by your intelligence and wishing I were as smart as you, then, realizing that you might be intelligent, but lacked the ability to express emotion.  Then I pitied you.  What comes so easily for me is, I think, physically painful for you.    You are what you were before.  I am better -- stronger, smarter, happier, healthier, prettier, more confident.  I am not scared.  You squeezed my heart and a flower came out.  Thanks.

      in so many ways.  I just graduated from grad school.  I'm trying to move out of my apartment -- conveniently after just renewing my lease, so I have to find a replacement leaser.  All the while trying to get a job that doesn't pay save wages.  Do you want to live in a phat apartment in Baltimore?  I don't.  That's why I'm trying to move.  I want to live in the Nation's Capitol -- home of my first apartment and all of my single friends.  I am a single woman in search of love and happiness.  One in a million, I know.  Stresss!  I won't harp on this.  Just telling you what I'm thinkg right now.

      So, I told the big secret and now it's out there and I had already mostly moved on.  It's been a while since I put it in the air and now I feel like the air is better than it used to be.  Are we better friends?  I don't know.  It wasn't awkward, mostly, I think because I was drunk.  Although I wanted to grab you and kiss you right there in the alley.  I wonder what you would have done.  It probably would not have been well received.  Well, at least, you wouldn't have allowed it to get to the point where it would have been well received.  You were right, though, and considering the major snafus that would result from our union, it's all for the best.  But it's frustrating to think that someone can control my choices when they are not even in my life anymore.  Part of what I enjoy about falling for someone is the process of cracking their shell.  Your refusal did not make me want to crack your shell any less.  (That is not meant as a double entendre).  I fear that the reason I so enjoy "cracking the shell" is because I have no shell.  Sometimes I try to practice being enigmatic and opaque so that people want to dig deeper.  I have never fully succeeded with people that I actually like.  This makes me wonder if I am trying to crack the shell of people who really don't like me -- do I make it easy to be withdrawn, inaccessible, surface-dwelling?  No, I don't think so, but I do think that I have no shell for people I like because I want to please them.  Also, I'm not good at playing games.  Anyway, I still want you.  But you are added to the list of things that I want but can't have, like weekly massages, a personal trainer, and a vacation house.  The thing is, that there is a possibility I might have those other things in the future, but I will never have you, so having you on that list is less than satisfying.  It would be nice to know that if you had a similar list, I would be on it.  That would be satisfying.

      How can anyone judge another person's choices without knowing the whole story.&nbsp; Why is it that I have known so many people (mostly men) that can place certain actions in distinct categories regardless of context.&nbsp; Why does it bother me when my opinion is different than someone else's.&nbsp; Correction, why does it bother me when my opinion is different than someone's that I respect.&nbsp; Perhaps because I often find myself respecting people that are very strong willed and forceful.&nbsp; They make me question my beliefs, which is sometimes good, but not always.&nbsp; I am not a bad person.&nbsp; Perhaps I sometimes base my decisions a bit too much on emotion.&nbsp; I have regrets, both old and new.&nbsp; But I accept my choices as my own and don't expect anyone else to do the same.&nbsp; Whose business is it what I do with my life, as long as I don't hurt anyone.&nbsp; I have never knowingly inflicted pain on another human being.&nbsp; Unless you count middle school, but that was petty bullshit.&nbsp; At the same time, I want the people that I respect to respect me.&nbsp; I will always support a friend in making a choice that makes them happier, even if that choice will result in someone else getting hurt, because life is too short to be unhappy and afraid.&nbsp; Love is dangerous.&nbsp; People get hurt.&nbsp; Everyone knows this going into a relationship.&nbsp; If you've never been hurt by love you're not doing it right.&nbsp; And you weren't really in love.&nbsp; I think my biggest problem is falling in love too easily.&nbsp; It can get messy quickly.&nbsp; But I couldn't live without romance.&nbsp; Anyone that could is not really living.&nbsp;

      Not being well versed in the art of one nighters I am at a loss to comprehend the abrupt end to what seemed a good connection.  I feel rejected, sort of.  I also feel dissatisfied.  I see the first time as a kind of survey -- to figure out what works and how.  The second time is always better.  Should I have said something?  This is weird.  Well, live and learn I guess.  Too bad.  Would have liked to do it again.
