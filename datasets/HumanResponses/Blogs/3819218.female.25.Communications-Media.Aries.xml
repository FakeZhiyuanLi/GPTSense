      It is so cool to watch a baby discover the world. Quinn laughed for the first time on July 4th. My Dad was being goofy and waving a towel at her and for some reason she found it humorous. The silly thing then cried a few seconds later when Dad put the towel over her head for a second to do peek-a-boo!  &nbsp; She changes so much week by week. Her hand-eye coordination is starting to develop and it is so neat to watch her reach for things and actually touch them! Next thing I know she will be picking up everything in sight. She has been working on rolling over as well. I think she could do it if she just put a little more ooomph behind it, but so far she just hasn't pushed herself over! &nbsp; She was so good in nursery at church today. I was relieved because last time she was in nursery she cried half the time she was there... and I mean screamed. I think the fact that she had two good naps BEFORE church made a big difference. I think I finally might have found a happy medium. If i can get her to take two naps before church then she is "napped up" and ready to go for a few hours. We even went out to eat afterwards. We fed her a bottle and then she took a catnap.  &nbsp; She is mellowing out quite a bit now. I still notice a difference if she doesn't get her Zantac dose or if she spits half of it out. I wonder what she would have been like as a newborn if it hadn't been for the acid reflux? I'm just grateful that she didn't end up in the hospital or anything. Some babies quit eating or throw up so much that they don't get enough to eat.  &nbsp; There is a part of me that is looking forward to her becoming mobile... rolling, crawling, walking... but on the otherhand I also know that the older she gets the stronger her "will" is going to get. Both Bryan and I are convinced that we are going to have a strong-willed child on our hands. I suppose time will tell!!

      A few years ago, I hosted a lock-in for the girls in the youth group. Sometime near the god-awful hour of 4 in the morning one of the teens and I were enjoying the peace and quiet after the rest of the girls were out. She asked me what my dreams were. Funny question, I thought. I was graduated from college, had a job I enjoyed, was married to a guy I loved, and in general felt pretty much at peace with my place in the world. Dreams? In some ways, all of things things that teenagers dream of had already happened to me. Had I forogotten to continue dreaming? Well, I replied to this girl, of course I dream of having children... but that is a given for most women I suppose. Dreams. Do dreams get lost as you age? When life's beckon drowns out the idleness and carefree ways of youth?  &nbsp; Ceasing to dream must be a sign of losing oneself in the rat-race of life. Another is neglecting to cultivate or pursue interests. I'm guilty of that one as well. Bryan tells me that I don't have any hobbies. I guess my hobbies are just different so he doesn't quite see them that way. Right now the only "hobby" that I've had any time to devote to is cloth diapering my child. Yes, call me strange, loopy, nusto... pick your favorite term for a crazy person. Originally I wanted to cloth diaper because I though it would save money and be better for my baby. I DO think it is better for my baby, but I'm not so sure it will save much money in the long run. Why? It is addictive!! My husband would say that really isn't a hobby, but to me it is. I have other hobbies that I'd like to devote time to eventually.&nbsp;I don't want to loose the joy that I get from B&amp;W photography, I'd love to learn how to make stained glass, and I'd like to learn how to sew (properly that is!!). Someday.  &nbsp; As far as dreams go, I do still have those wistful hopes floating in my mind. These are the things that are highly unlikely, but are dreams none the less. I'd love to have my own B&amp;W photo lab, create a business doing websites for small businesses, create a site that earns the Macromedia Site of the Day Award, photograph different cultures (for National Geographic even)... those are the ones that I can think of at the moment. Some are possible given time. Regardless of whether or not they are possible, I don't want to stop dreaming.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I've always thought that I handled change pretty well. Although here I am, resentful at times that everything about my life has changed and will forever remain so. I can't say that I don't like my life as it currently is. It is just different. Drastically different.  &nbsp; Adjusting to my life as it is now has been difficult because I feel as though I am struggling to hold on to the things that are familiar. Work is probably the best example of this. I enjoyed my job (save maybe the government work) and I always loved the challenge of learning new things. I find myself missing that challenge. It is so wierd to go into work on Thursdays -&nbsp;for a few hours it feels as though time is standing still and that things are exactly the way they used to be. And I miss it. It is familiar, and I feel as though I know what to expect. Unlike caring for Quinn which is so knew and at times I feel so lost. &nbsp; If I had a choice I wouldn't be working. I should have made the choice back before Quinn came to stop working. I think I'd be a different person right now. I have to say that trying to work and trying to deal with a challenging child has been a huge struggle. Those early days were especially hard when I was exhausted and could barely concentrate. How could I have known? Trying to work those first few months took a lot out of me I think.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bryan and I were talking last night and he mentioned that he never really wanted me to work. I didn't realize that. He says that he told me and he may have. I wish I would have heard it and I wish I would have listened. It may be that I didn't want to let Studio 105 down because they have been so good to me. And because I didn't want to let them down, I didn't hear. I don't know. In my heart I knew that I didn't want to work. I wish that I would learn to follow my heart. I'm finding more and more that if I would only listen to what my heart is telling me to do I would be a much happier and sane person.&nbsp;If I had chosen to stop working I would be able to focus all of my time and energy on learnng to be a mother. Instead I'm torn. I'm being stretched between work and mothering.  &nbsp; Part of the reason I didn't want to quit is because I didn't want to let go. I like what I do and I get satisfaction from it.&nbsp;I was familiar. So here I am now. I can't dwell on regret, but I do need to make the best of my situation. I don't want to stop working because it is at least slightly familiar and right now it is the only thing that I get to do just for me. It is selfish I suppose. Am I being too selfish? Am I fooling myself to think that things will get better? Will I eventually find that balance where work does not seem to be such a burden?  &nbsp; Studio 105 has been so good to me. I want to be good back to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan and Quinn do come first though and there are times that I have to remind myself of that. When&nbsp;or if&nbsp;the time comes that I don't work for them anymore I will feel a huge loss. I couldn't have asked for a better job in my early years of adulthood. Sure it was tough at times having as much responsibility as I did - but I also loved the challenge.&nbsp;And&nbsp;I at least knew that when things went wrong that I was the one that screwed up! I always hated having to rely on others to do a job... one of the reasons that I hated group projects in school!!  &nbsp; Right now I guess it is one day at a time. The days are flying by and I do think that I'm starting to find a balance. Sure, it is definitely a struggle on some days. I am so thankful that Studio 105 has been patient with me. It has been hard for both Studio 105 and I as we have been trying to figure out how our relationship with each other is to work. Things are better in some ways. I guess only time will tell what I'm capable off. It may be that I do have to give up work and focus entirely on being a mom. Or I may be able to find a balance and continue to do something that I enjoy.  &nbsp; I guess only time will tell.

      I expected a roller coaster of emotions to accompany motherhood. I didn't expect how tumultuos the ride would be. Last week I took a ride down "Defeat Drop" and boy was it a fast fall. We've had so much trouble with nursing and I finally just broke. I felt such a sense of loss and defeat. We worked so hard at nursing. Despite our hard work, things never quite seemed to straighten out. Quinn has never nursed for comfort and rarely seemed to enjoy it. There were moments where she would smile and talk to me while nursing and I will always cherish those memories. It felt so right.  I still don't know what exactly happened, but Quinn began fussing during nursing and eventually just quit nursing during the day. So many things happened at once that I really don't know what to attribute the change to, but despite all of my best efforts I couldn't get her to nurse. After about a week I finally broke down and began giving her a bottle because I had no patience left to deal with a tired and hungry baby that wouldn't eat. The day I realized that I would have to pump and supplement with formula was very difficult. In the beginning, with every issue that we encountered I would just remind myself that someday we would be able to enjoy the closeness that comes with breastfeeding. Babies and mothers are supposed to enjoy breastfeeding, but I know that it doesn't work for anyone. The sense of defeat and loss that I felt was overwhelming. What could I have done different? Was there something i missed? Did I push to hard? Was I not patient enough? Did she associate the reflux with nursing? I'm sure I'll never know.   What I do know is that I put every last ounce of energy and strength into breastfeeding and that I tried. I've never accepted failure very well. Of course, who does?

       Its sort of like a daily poker game: you never know what youre going to draw from one day to the next.   That is exactly how I feel. I never quite know how to deal with Quinn somedays. When I finally seem to find something that works, it doesn't last long. We call her "Drama Quinn" for a reason. Quinn in Latin means queen... and she definitely fits the definition of a drama queen! She can be quite insistent in letting you know what she wants. And there are times when I haven't a clue. I feel so lost sometimes. Like I'm trying to communicate with a foreigner who has limited communication skills. I feel so bad for Quinn when I can't seem to figure out what she wants or needs. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to be a baby!!   She fits just about every trait of a high needs baby listed in the article. And I seem to have been blessed with the most challenging of high need babies - the uncuddly flavor. I'm hoping it is just a stage, but I have a feeling that for now that is just the way that she is. Her "uncuddliness" seems to have gotten so much worse in the past couple of weeks. I don't understand. I can barely get her to nurse and she even fights taking a bottle at times. She'll arch her back and fuss. And if she tries to eat while she isn't completely relaxed she coughs and chokes. And getting her to sleep is becoming almost impossible. It used to be that I could just hold her sideways and sway back and forth while singing to her. Now she is so distractable and squirmy that I can barely keep her in my arms! She tries to sit up and then she arches her back... then she twists sideways and tries to look around. She can barely keep her eyes open yet she refuses to relax. Half that time I feel like I am fighting with her. Feeling that way is really taking its toll on me.  Dealing with her is really wearing me thin. She is beautiful when she is awake; I love to listen to her talk and to watch her smile and play. But I have such a hard time because I feel like I don't know how to give her what she needs. I feel like I am such a horrible mother that I can't read my own child sometimes. I feel like I have no confidence and then I get frustrated and my patience just flies out the window.   I just pray that God will give me the grace to take one day at a time.

      Bryan and I went out on a "date" tonight. It felt strange leaving Quinn with Bryan's mom... but it felt natural I suppose. We are so lucky to have family close to support us. My mom and Bryan's mom have been such a help to me. Sometimes not just by watching Quinn, but by also being there to listen and to sympathize with our struggles! It is amazing to me how one tiny little person can bring about such a dramatic change. I knew that life would never the same, but knowing is not the same as the actual experience. There really isn't any way that anyone can prepare you for just how different life will be. The incredible joys, the frustrations, the hopes and the dreams, the exhaustion... emotions that seem to change by the minute yet are part of every day.   Being a first-time mom has been a challenge because I'm such a wallflower. I don't like to stand out in the crowd, especially when I'm in new situations. I need a certain level of confidence in order to feel comfortable out in public. Everybody has there comfort zones... some are just smaller than others! I guess it has also been hard because of Quinn's acid reflux and her very "vocal" nature. I feel very out of control with her sometimes. On the other hand I can almost read her like a book and I'm much more confident in knowing what to do. She still throws me for loops at times... the past couple of weeks have been evident of that! But even during the trying times I feel so luckhy to have such a beautiful daughter... she is such a cutie... I live for her smiles and her facial expressions. The way she moves those eyebrows cracks me up. I wouldn't trade her for the world.

      My husband is berating me for choosing a pink template... ok, maybe berating is a bit harsh. He was just a bit suprised.  Pink has never been my color of choice. In fact it is close to last on the list of color choices. My first experience decorating my own room is likely the reason for my intolerance of pink. I was allowed to choose the paint color for my room as a pre-teen. I choose a light rose color. I disliked it immediately. My grandfather even repainted it a slightly darker shade. I tolerated it but I definitely wasn't crazy about it. I'm glad my parents let me choose the color. It was a live and learn experience and even today choosing paint colors is STILL a live and learn experience. I'm still just as picky about paint colors even in my own home today. The dining room is Cranapple, the baby's room Golden Cricket (a golden green color), the bathroom a Powder Blue... and I'd probably change all of the colors if I had the time. The question of the hour though is how many times would I repaint the room before I was finally satisfied?! I'm guessing it would probably take me 4 tries for each room by the time I arrived at the *perfect* color.   As for the pink in my room as a pre-teen... I always considered myself slightly tomboyish. I loved to climb trees and get dirty. I enjoyed beating the guys in gym class at pushup, pullups and situps. I owe my strength and determination to gymnastics which taught be a lot about perseverance and hard work. I didn't mind the sweat. At any rate, I was anything but a girly-girl. The light rose color of my walls only reinforced this fact. I've since learned that I like bold and and bright, or calm and serene. In my opinion, pink is usually a mush color that is neither bold and bright or calm and serene.   But then of course the shade of pink makes a huge difference. I can tolerate and even like a bold pink. And on my baby girl, I must admit, she looks pretty cute in pink. So really - I don't hate pink... I just don't CARE for pink and specifically, I'm not crazy about pastel "baby" pink.

      Stability and cyberspace should never appear in the same sentence. Companies, websites, information, and misinformation come and go faster than the ocean tides... servers change, hardware dies, backups are lost, companies are bought... all in the blink of an eye. As a designer of websites I'm accustomed to this volatility... yet I will never be used to it. I am convinced that somewhere there must exist a cyber abyss where all lost information is filed, dead websites spend eternity, and renamed companies pay penance in purgatory.   Hence my fear with baring my soul on a blog. I must subject my thoughts to the blogging Gods... and pray that my rantings and ravings will be spared from the cyber abyss.
