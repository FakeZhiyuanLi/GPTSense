						   It constantly amazes me that the farther we think we are from our past experiences the more familiar our present day circumstances appear to us.   I watched "Mean Girls" a couple of weeks ago and heartily recommend it to anyone who's ever seen themselves in someone else.  Yourself as you've been.  Yourself as you could be.  Yourself as you wish you were.  For those of you who haven't yet reached that level of consciousness: don't go, it's boring.  For the rest of us, we're reminded that high school's all about who you are and what you do to make sure everyone else knows that.  "Mean Girls" does a great job at presenting the fact that everyone desires the power associated with popularity in high school.  And to draw on the wise words of classic comics,"With great power comes great responsibility."  There you go, "Mean Girls" drives home the message of "Spider-man", who knew?   Today, I was reminded that not everyone likes me, just as I don't like everyone I meet.  Simple message but one I forget.  More importantly, I'd forgotten that people I have no problem with may have a problem with me and that, conversely, people that seem to have a problem with me, may not.  I admit to self-centredness, to self-absorbtion, to selfishness too.  But I argue that I'm not alone and that every person sees the world from a biased perspective and naturally from how it relates to themselves.  So if a person seems to shoot you down constantly and disrespect your contributions and disregard your perspective, you would be valid in thinking they had a problem with you, right?  Turns out you could be wrong, as I was. In my infinite wisdom  , I recognize that there will always be personality clashes within any group.  But life would be a lot more understandable if those personality clashes had reasons.  For instance, if she's really loud and obnoxious or if he talks too much with his hands.  But when one person can just LOOK at a newcomer and decide that there is no room in their social group for that person... I dunno.  I like to say that "That's so high school" but I'm realizing that, yeah, although high school students exhibit a lot of exclusionary traits and can be parodied for their preoccupation with identifying themselves by who they DON'T associate with, those who would like to think of themselves as "grown-up" do the same, some with more skill than others. I'd be naive to claim that the world would work better by simply taking time to clarify communication, since I've argued that human language is a constantly changing and always imperfect mode of communication, but I get very tired and frustrated with the sheer idiotic nature of interpersonal relations.  If one were to vent about another to a third, the third should recognize that the first doesn't want the said venting to be passed on to the other.  Mind you, the first should realize that anything they put out there has the potential to come back on them.  Hmmm, I'm getting fairly philosophical on a very concrete event.  But sometimes you just gotta vent.

						   Now for a proper post... My main purpose for setting up this blog is to make accessible my DVD collection to my local friends who help me get them viewed at least once by borrowing them.  I originally created an Excel sheet but e-mailing it out everytime I updated the list got to be a pain. A secondary purpose which presented itself while I was posting the lists is that this is a chance to discuss the film and television media and the culture of consumption that we live in.  I'll be the first to step forward as a consumption addict, a pack-rat, a spendthrift, an incurable collector.  DVDs, books, photos, clothes, videos (in the pre-digital era), and "collectible" figurines/dolls/cards.  It goes on... and most people who know me know this. To introduce myself, I'm in university pursuing a degree in Education.  I'm looking forward to travelling and teaching for a bit after finishing this program in August.  It'll be a chance to live "light" for a while, I think.  And this is probably the most high-tech thing I've ever done.

						   I had to think long and hard about whether or not to continue my movie-themed titles for this post.  My partner's mother passed away last week and although it hasn't caused any major emotional trauma (yet?) it has been as odd a situation for me as a sad one for him.  I didn't get along with her thanks to one very ill-advised summer when we invited her to move in with us out here on the West Coast.  We parted on bad terms but, over the years, I've sorted her into the corner of my memories reserved for ex-bestfriends, psychotic classmates, and bitter ex-boyfriends.  It's a space that doesn't really draw all that much attention on a daily basis and could pretty much drop off the planet without causing any major ripples in my life.  They just don't matter that much and wasting energy in rage, revenge, jealousy, suspicion or any of those negative feelings just isn't worth it.  There's no pay off as this situation so suitably demonstrates.  The uniqueness of her passing is that it still affects me through her son and will probably continue to do so on some subconscious level for some time.   I did think about titling this post.  The first one that came to mind was "Death Becomes Her" (a movie I actually did see - big mistake) but I decided that it was too irreverent and could be construed as disrespectful.  Unfortunately, once I got on the disrespectful train of thought, every title that I thought of was unacceptable - "Throw Mama From the Train", "Serial Mom", "Y tu mama tambien"... thus, the Untitled nature of this post. Brendan's going away to settle her "estate".  A paranoid corner of my mind wonders if his time in the backwoods of his childhood will cause any of the troubles that we've seemed to have worked through regarding his mother to resurface.  There don't seem to be any right now... ah, paranoia, the bane of the peaceful mind...

						   Yeah, so I went and watched the midnight screening of  Spider-Man 2  last night.  I find to ensure that my expectations aren't raised unreasonably high, I need to see shows early.  Cases in point being Matrix Revolutions and Star Wars Episode 2.   Anyway,  SPOILER WARNING  for Spidey 2.   For those of you who might've caught Peggy and me giving what seemed to be an unreserved thumbs up to the CityTV camera last night, I have to admit I chickened out of panning the movie with a tv camera in my face.  Not that it was really worthy of panning.  I just didn't get into the things I disliked about it and focussed on the good stuff.  Because there actually is good stuff.  Like the first one, it was an okay show.  I'll give it kudos for some really excellent special effects and fight scenes as well as some stand-out performances by Alfred Molina as Doc Oc, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, and, my fave from the first, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  Oh, and Bruce Campbell.   I love Bruce Campbell .  The rest of the cast did some nice if not amazing stuff even, here and there, Miss Dunst.  Director Sam Raimi really excels at bringing the comic book feel to the films, especially the hokey dialogue and musical score, but still keeping the viewer in the realm of believeability.  And it's so cute how brother Ted always appears in a bit part.  However, a small petty part of me needs Mary Jane to die or to revert to her real Gwen Stacy persona and die and then be reborn as a naturally redheaded, savvy, truly talented actress whose best role wasn't a blood-sucking ten-year-old.  There was a lot of superfluous screaming in this movie.  More than in the first.  And a lot of girly shots.  Not only that, but all of New York gets a peek up both Mary Jane's and Aunt May's skirts.  The best aspect of this film was probably, for me, the departure from the Ultimate Good versus the Ultimate Evil themes of the super-hero movies.  The  Spider-Man  saga lends itself to the exploration of the conflicting identities of all its characters.  The human-ness, if you will.  Peter is clumsy, inept, dorky, and socially stupid despite his scientific genius and his radioactive gifts.  Harry is somewhat endearing as Peter's friend despite his vengence-driven downward spiral of sanity.  Aunt May is depressed, angry and heart-broken despite her strength and integrity.  Otto Octavius is a loving husband, a genius, and dies a hero despite letting his creations drive him to evil deeds and a possible apocolypse.  Mary Jane... well, she just pisses me off so I'm not even going to try to explore her character.  Despite the MJ flaw, snaps to the production staff of  Spider-Man 2  for a visually sensational, genuine, and adequately faithful movie filled with good-quality cheese. Now to nit-pick: 1) If a wall was about to fall on you, a helpless comic book female romantic lead, certain to crush you into human tortilla or send you to a watery death, would your first thought be to adjust your hemline to a more modest level, especially since everyone's already seen your undies twenty minutes before?  And how did you get so wet anyway?  It's not raining out and there was no reason for Doc Oc to dunk you in the river. 2) If you thought that your best friend was protecting the web-slinging freak who killed your father, who never really cared for you anyway, in the interests of a good photo op, would you get publicly drunk, yell at him with tears in your eyes, and then, in manly traditional, SLAP him?  Twice? 3) If you've been dead for two years, killed with a one-of-a-kind prototype super glider while wearing one-of-a-kind prototype green super armour, when would you have the time to rebuild, polish and display a new glider and set of armour and restock an arsenal of "pumpkin" grenades?  Not to mention reformulate and produce a supply of Goblin serum?  Or are we supposed to believe the butler did it? 4) If you, a genius burdened with the privilege of bettering life for the whole planet, had created a set of appendages capable of withstanding any sort of weapon, as well as super-heat, super-stress, radiation, and fusion power, wouldn't you think that making them water-proof would be a good idea too? 5) Ok, yeah, confession is good for the soul, but really, what is the point of a secret identity once your girlfriend, your aunt, a whole train full of New Yorkers and your arch-enemy know your real identity? There were a couple of story-line holes too, but I think I've made my point.  Amazingly, I usually don't get a chance to nit-pick until my second viewing.  These ones are just too obvious.  If anyone catches anything else, please share...in the meantime, enjoy the heavy-handed Jesus metaphors throughout!

						   Finally, a movie I've seen! And one with darker and more depressing humour than I had ever seen before. Not that it wasn't well done. Witherspoon and Broderick were terrific, the former sweetly evil and the other painfully and pathetically human. I don't own it and probably won't buy it. There's a category of films out there that one needs see only once. They are films that need to be seen and may change the viewer's life profoundly but change is sometimes very painful and if the film does it really well, you just don't need to see it again.  Se7en  is one of these for me. Another, from what I hear from friends, is  Requiem for a Dream , which I do own and will watch eventually. Now that my movie-duty is served, my real topic is actually the Canadian federal election which took place today. At my advanced and maturated age of 26, I voted for the first time today, spurred by my concerns about the possibilities of a Conservative government and the $1.75 that each vote is worth to each party that gets over 2% of the national vote. Brendan chose to go Green, believing that his one vote wasn't going to matter that much and wanting to help the Greens hit that 2% more. Up until the moment I stepped into that voting booth, there was a very good chance that I would do the same. However, Kennedy Stewart, the NDP candidate in my riding had been actively and vocally endorsed by several organizations whose opinions I respect: the Canadian Union of Public Employees, to which I belong; the Canadian Federation of Students, of which I would be a member if it really mattered; and the  Georgia Straight , Vancouver's premier independent newspaper. Therefore, Kennedy got my vote. Unfortunately, the Liberal candidate was declared a winner with a lead of approximately 580 votes. Welcome back, Hedy Fry. This was also the first year that I took an active interest in watching the results come in. Maybe that's what voting does for you - acts as an investment that sparks actual interest. So I spent over five hours on my couch watching political leaders make speeches and political analysts spout off. I did get to catch a funny rant from Rick Mercer and had a good laugh when Peter Mansbridge refer to the "whack of ridings" in Ontario that voted Liberal and when he couldn't stop smirking over the Marxist-Leninist candidate that briefly led his riding. Heck, I even found amusement in hearing a political pollster use the term "smack-down" when referring to voter reactions. However, a strong undercurrent of anxiety existed throughout the evening. From all the polls that had come out in the last little while, a Conservative government looked more than likely. And then I would have to leave. Really. But Canadian voters aren't as stupid as we look sometimes. Well, maybe Albertans. The initial "final" results for those of you who look to me as a source of information as well as amusement (or who live under a rock or in California) currently stand thus:  Liberals with  135  seats Conservatives with  99  seats Bloc Quebecois with  54  seats NDP with  19  seats and  one  Independent in a pear tree...  So, knowing (as we all do) that  155  seats make up a majority government, we can see that the Liberals have walked into a very sensitive position. Not nearly the fearsome Conservative horde that we were lead to expect but still a very precarious situation for any government to be in. Minority governments in Canada, historically, have an average lifespan of  16  months and IF the Liberals can convince the NDP AND the Independent (Chuck Cadman, who used to be Conservative before losing the nomination in Surrey North) to work with them, they hold just enough seats to ride out this term. And then they would have to elect a Speaker of the House, who cannot vote and reduces their numbers by one. Furthermore, the chances of pleasing both Cadman and the NDPs for any length of time will take considerable effort. By electing Mr. Cadman to the Speaker's position, the Liberals have a chance of avoiding the dreaded vote of non-confidence but only just...  Getting to see each leader make his "victory" speech was a interesting study in contrasts. Paul Martin couldn't stop smiling in relief. He was really on the ropes during this election campaign and not completely by his own fault. The fight isn't over, I'm sure he knows, but getting to keep his office is a big first step. His speech was sincere and eloquent and touching. It's always nice to see the underdog get a bone. Jack Layton just couldn't stop talking, it seemed. His speech was repetitive and boring and LONG. His wife, who lost in her riding, kept smiling this really painful smile the whole time. The NDPs did well though. They were the only party of the top three that increased their popular vote and now they wield the ultimate power to make or break this government when Parliament is called to session in the fall. Who woulda thunk it? If only Layton didn't come across as so dumb. Yeah, I'm one of those people who votes for the person not the party, so if Layton had been in my riding, the Greens would probably have gotten my dollar seventy-five. Then there was Gilles Duceppe whose speech seemed to be the shortest. Here, I'm trusting in the female translator's ability to accurately Anglify his words without sucking out most of his meaning. My core French seemed to agree with the translation, at least the "thank-you"s and "victory"s seemed to be in the right spots. Stephen Harper is a creepy man. His photos are creepy. His interviews seem creepy. His television campaign ads were most definitely creepy. His hair doesn't move and I'm not sure if his lips do either. He could easily, and realistically, be cast as an android in some sci-fi horror film. But by far the creepiest thing I've noticed about him was tonight. He has the most aryan-wannabee family I have ever seen in Canadian politics. His wife's straight out of Stepford (the creepy original not the humourous remake) and the kids could be Children of the Corn. Bottle blondes and white, white, white. I swear he and his wife even had their supportive spouse kisses scripted and timed because at one point it looked like he missed his cue and she was just hanging there, all puckered up, for a second. Like I said, creepy. In fact, the whole of the Conservative party supporters were lacking in racial diversity. Mind you, that last observation could just be from an urban Vancouverite looking a hundreds of south Calgaryans...  In any case, I think I've picked a most interesting time to start paying attention to Canadian politics. I'm still leaving in the fall, but now I'll have something political to keep track of while I'm overseas.

						   Yet another unrelated title...I'm not even sure that I know what that movie is about...however, it does describe quite accurately how I felt while watching the credits of Michael Moore's  Bowling for Columbine . I can't believe how long it took me to get to watching this movie and how, despite the HUGE build up of expectation thanks to friends, media, and awards shows, it still somehow managed to surprise and inspire me. Having said that, I'm staying true to my well-learned lesson in False Authority and would like to state clearly that I know that  Bowling for Columbine  is strategically and wholly biased as a product of Moore's personal opinions. And even if I had not learned that lesson quite recently and therefore had it fresh in my mind while watching a documentary like this one, the entire Canadian segment of the film would have clued me in. Not only were his scenes of "slums" ridiculous but the people he interviewed needed some serious waking-up. I viewed it as comedic license. Which I feel was necessary to off-set the absolute horror of watching the Columbine School film of the day of the shooting. (My degrees of separation theory gets another work-out here as a classmate of mine has a cousin who attended the school and who was warned by one of the gunmen the day of the shooting to stay away. Count 'em people, that's two degrees from the school and three from the gunmen. Anyone who knows me is four...) I'm curious to know how the celebrities in the film feel about their portrayal. Maybe not Manson, who comes across as one of the most thoughtful, well-spoken music idols I have yet to see interviewed, but Dick Clark and, you knew this was coming, NRA-President, Charleton Heston (who, incidentally, my brother and I met and got autographs from on a plane back from Las Vegas. His lady friend was wearing a lot of furs which caught my mom's attention and she was the one who actually recognized Moses. That's two degrees for anyone lucky enough to know my brother or me. A side-note to the side-note, a good rant - ignore the grammar and spelling - is always waiting for you at  urlLink artfanaticism.blogspot.com  , some of which I'm proud to say I've inspired) But back to the initial thought, did these celebrities make any sort of statement after the enormous success and distribution of the film? Were any changes made to the Work for Welfare system in Michigan? We know about the K-Mart ammo cessation but how about the banks and their "open an account and get a gun" deal? I won't go on much longer on this zealous line, but the film really is everything a documentary should be: powerful, emotionally-stirring, informative, instructional, and ironically humourous. I'm looking forward to exploring the bonus material and rewatching it with the commentary. Not to mention  Farenheit 911 . Oh, and I own  The Awful Truth  now too.  The to-do list gets longer everyday.  Topic change: In stark contrast to some bloggers, I write for my audience. Otherwise, I'd keep it in my head. Everything I share here is meant to be shared and open to critique. (This constant, and admittedly egocentric, sense of being read and judged, - even when I'm not - probably stems back to coming home one night in my formative teenage years to find my father reading my diary.) Therefore, I welcome feedback on anything that catches a reader's eye whether it is simple spelling (which I'm constantly catching myself and trying to correct) or topic-related commentary. I have yet been stirred to any serious emotional out-pouring requiring anything less than polite language, but promise not to water down any that may arise in the future (Beware, Princess Y!). I don't have the time on my hands that some bloggers do and therefore can only post with occasional regularity but when I do, you can count on me trying to put up some quality...

						   Hmmm, maybe I am that gullible... turns out that the folks who run snopes.com have a wicked sense of humour and their "Lost Legends" page, from which I gleaned the KFC debunking is actually their own private rumour mill to educate their readers in the dangers of blind belief.  urlLink http://www.snopes.com/lost/false.htm   So, to set the record straight, Kentucky never trademarked the state's name. KFC's name change WAS due in part to a healthier image, in part a more varied menu selection, and in keeping with the trend of "hipper" looks for older franchises (eg. International House of Pancakes => IHOP). I might have picked up on their game sooner if I had looked at other rumours on the "Lost Legends" page (ie. Mr. Ed was actually a female zebra and Mississippi removing fractions and decimals from the math curriculum)  So, egg and all, I face up to my errors and salute the ingenuity of Barbara and David Mikkelson. I don't know that I will ever be as astute and skeptical as I should be, but I will remember to think twice before repeating everything I hear.

						   Geez, you'd think I could name at least one of these postings after a movie I've actually seen or bought (since one does not guarantee the other). But, no, I have not seen Urban Legend or its sequel, which thankfully was true to its subtitle, the Final Cut. When the first one came out in 1998, I thought the premise had merit as a slasher teen horror/suspense, since the urban legends I was familiar with (usually involving a babysitter or teens lost on a country road or flashing headlights) seemed to epitomize the freaky, back-of-your mind waking nightmare style of said movies. Furthermore the cast of the first one was actually pretty cool, especially Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger, for you uninformed folks) as the professor. Maybe, I'll "rent" it this weekend... Anyhow, the reason for the title is my horrified realization that I have been the dupe and spreader of at least three totally false urban legends: 1. that Tommy Hilfiger made racist remarks about the people who buy his clothes 2. that KFC is involved in raising mutant chickens 3. that Mariah Carey made a horrible remark about African children Admittedly, I probably knew deep down that the mutant chicken story was a crock, but the other two seemed to have been authentically sourced and were so commonly accepted that I honestly thought that they were true. A class discussion on media and the marketing of "cool" was what started my journey to epiphany. The aforementioned Tommy Hilfiger incident was mentioned and more than half the class knew about it and several, including myself, commented on how we had made an effort to boycott any Tommy-related merchandise. One classmate piped up and said that he had heard that that incident was an urban myth. The idea had never occurred to me and I volunteered to check it out. Enter  urlLink http://snopes.com . Turns out the Hilfiger rumour was actually a revamped version of one spread in the 80s about then-uberpopular designer Liz Claiborne. One possible origin for the Hilfiger version is in an interview he did on the topic of black market knockoffs of his clothing emerging mostly from small Pacific Rim countries. He commented that people shouldn't buy the knockoffs from Asian and South Asian countries like the Philippines because the knockoffs won't fit right and won't look as good. A theory exists that this comment mutated into him saying that Asians and Filipinos don't look good in his clothes and shouldn't wear them. From here, a slippery slope led to the story of him being kicked off of Oprah for saying that is he had known how many blacks and Hispanics were going to be wearing his clothes, he never would've designed them. Again, I declare at the top of my lungs, THIS STORY IS FALSE! But, boy, do people ever WANT to believe it. BTW, this does not mean I will be buying Tommy clothes anytime soon. I still think they are way to expensive for what you get and I haven't seen anything in their clothing line remotely attractive yet. Having had my eyes opened to my own gullibility, I explored the snopes.com site further and debunked the other two rumours that I am guilty of spreading. The KFC one's truth is actually pretty funny. I had heard (and propagated) the story that they bred genetically enhanced chickens that matured faster, developed more white meat, plumper breasts and thighs, and, in some of the wilder versions of the story, unnatural multiples of both breasts and thighs. Although I discounted the 4-breasted, 10-legged version of the story, I gave some merit to the idea of the Franken-chickens due to the fact that KFC had changed their official name from Kentucky Fried Chicken, possibly because they were no longer really serving "real" chickens. The second version of this rumour is that the name change was because the word "fried" didn't test well with the more health-conscious fast-food consumers. This too is false. The one word no rumour-mongers latched onto was the actual reason behind the name change. "In 1990, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, mired in debt, took the unusual step of trademarking their name. Henceforth, anyone using the word "Kentucky" for business reasons -- inside or outside of the state -- would have to obtain permission and pay licensing fees to the Commonwealth of Kentucky." Snopes.com actually has a glitch in their information on this story. If you search for "KFC", it actually leads to a page that debunks the mutant chicken theory but gives credence to the health angle. If you browse  urlLink "Lost Legends"  you find the a page that debunks the health angle as well and explains the trademarking dealy. (I've written into the site managers for clarification.) The Mariah Carey story is one I won't even dignify by reproducing here but I think it says something about a celebrity's reputation when they can be so flagrantly misquoted and most people are willing to believe it. Lastly, for those too lazy to go the site themselves: - no one in medical history, not even Richard Gere, has EVER had a gerbil/hamster/other sort of rodent surgically removed from their rectum - officially, the cover artist for Disney's "The Little Mermaid" never meant to draw a penis into the castle towers in the background - the word "SEX" does appear in the background of a scene in Disney's "The Lion King" but only if you look REALLY closely - to date, there is no substantial proof that Dr. Atkins suffered a heart attack before dying - Neil Armstrong never wished any fictional Jewish neighbour luck after walking on the moon (Incidentally, his "one small step..." quote was actually flubbed in the excitement of the moment. For what he meant to say, you'll have to go to the site. HA! SUCKER!) - Coke is NOT an effective spermicide (I mean, really people, even  I'm  not that gullible!)

						   Again, another film I haven't yet seen.  However, I have seen the  C.S.I.  episode it inspired several times and I do intend to rent it one day (not because it was on  C.S.I. , or that it inspired Lenny's farewell episode and season finale on this past season's  Law and Order , but because Hitchcock is cool).  And it's a further misnomer in that this post is actually inspired by a ride on the bus, and a person that turned out not to be a stranger, and we didn't even plot the murder of one unsuspecting spouse. In fact, the other title I thought of was actually, "It's a Small World".  I've said it many, many times and will continue to chant it as I continuously renew acquaintances with old friends in new places.  For those who have read James Redfield's  The Celestine Prophecy  and who know longer believe in coincidence as chance but as guidance to a higher state of being, I should be turning into some sort of human shaped light bulb sometime next Tuesday.(End commentary #1) (Begin the narrative)  I have been shamelessly driving the twenty minutes to campus every school day for the last couple of weeks, wasting valuable fuel, polluting the environment, and being a regular slack-ass, and parking at the parkade for twelve freaking dollars a day.  Thus, I resolved to bus today and all of next week.  Mass transit holds many horrors for some but I'm always pleasantly surprised by the sense of leisure I experience riding the bus.  If there was no one I knew, which there was this morning, I could have read a book, maybe even finished it by the time I arrived.  Happily, one of my classmates was present and we chatted as well as we could through her coffee-craving haze all the way to school.  Afterschool, I was prevented from jetting home immediately by a meeting.  After that, I headed to the bus loop and waited awhile to board the bus.  While waiting, a suspicious individual caught my eye by moving in a slow semi-circle around me.  Recalling that a friend had recently had her wallet pickpocketed on campus, shifted so that I could see him out of the corner of my eye.  He seemed to be casing a redhead standing not so far from me with her shoulderbag on the ground between her feet.  The bus rolled up at this point and we boarded.  Sitting near the front, I overheard the redhead asking the driver for the transfer point to get to Granville Island.  I volunteered some information and she turned around to speak to me. Enter blast from the past.  We had lived on the same floor in residence for two years when we started university.  We spent the entire trip until she got off catching up on each other's worlds of the last four years.  I have her email and hopefully, we'll get together sometime soon. (End narrative) Okay, so this isn't such a huge thing, right?  People bump into each other all the time.  However, I don't just bump into just ONE person every once in a while.  I run into a random mob on an almost regular basis.  Or I find freak connections between new acquaintances and old ones.   For example, in  February , I took a four day trip to Edmonton for a convention and ran into:  Sydney, a girl from my second year in residence at UBC who turns out to be the cousin of a cousin of a classmate from grade five in Chilliwack; Chris, another girl from second year in residence who now manages the University of Alberta housing above the HUB; Twyla, my best friend from grade eight in Saskatoon who turns out to now be the best friend of Shirley, one of the girls I had come to the convention with; Phil, the guy I shared my first stage kiss with in grade ten in Saskatoon; and Ross, a classmate who I graduated high school with.    A month ago , when my car was away getting very expensive surgery, I hopped on a bus to go to work.  The book I was carrying caught the eye of a lady sitting near the front and she asked me about it since it was a play written by on actor I had seen the previous night.  She turned out not only to be friends with the actor/playwright but the mother of Kennedy, an actor that I had a huge crush on when I was fourteen and a friend and sometimes landlady of John, another actor that I've known personally for years.   About  two weeks ago , I went to a friend's wedding party.  Shortly after I arrived, I was introduced to Amy, a good friend of the groom, Alex.  While we chatted, I discovered she was the classmate of Matt, the fiance of one of my best friends, Melissa, who incidentally has no connection besides me (and now the Matt-Amy-Alex route)to the bride.  Furthermore, Amy had just graduated from the same program as Yvette, another friend of mine, is just about finished with.  Confused yet?   Then  last week , while waiting to ask a question at the administration building on campus, I asked the guy also waiting if his name was Paul on a hunch.  At that point, he recognized me too.  We had gone to the same high school in Saskatoon but hadn't seen each other in nearly ten years! The longer I live, the more I believe in the theory that everyone in the world is only separated by six degrees.  And the more people I meet, the more similarities I see in the human population.  I think my desire to travel comes from a need to know that the world is physically huge since societally, it feels so crowded sometimes.  I'm not saying that I don't enjoy my "small world" experiences (because they really do make my days infinitely more interesting), but if these serendipitous incidents are truly guiding me to a personal evolution, I'd like to have some idea of the route... otherwise, I'll just chalk it up to travelling the same circles despite all the detours and backtracking I've done.

						   How many brilliant ideas have stumbled, crumbled, shamed and disappointed on the cinematic screen?  Too many to contemplate, one might argue.  Now this might be unavoidable when the idea originates in one and is handed off to another to produce.  Case in point:  Buffy the Vampire Slayer , the motion picture, where creator Joss Whedon left the set after seeing the direction the film was going in.  However, there are cases where this explanation just doesn't fly, where creator and producer (and sometimes director) are one (or two) and the same.  Cases in point:  Matrix Revolutions  (which arrived in the mail today despite me NOT ordering it from Columbia House),  Matrix Reloaded , and the first two  Star Wars  prequels.  Granted, expectations are everything.  I expected too much from the first  Matrix  movie, which many people tell me was a good flick (it just wasn't as much when following  Run, Lola, Run  in a double feature, I guess), and made the same mistake with the second  Star Wars  prequel.  Strangely enough, I'm probably the only person I know who DIDN'T detest  The Phantom Menace  and I didn't even mind  Revolutions  that much since I expected less than a little from it.  Again, expectations are everything.  Who could've predicted that  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  would be received as well as it was? It was based on an amusement ride, for Pete's sake!  Or that  New York Minute  would last just that long?  Well... okay, that one most people saw coming. Expectations are tricky things.   Ishtar  and Marky Mark's  The Planet of the Apes  probably had proud parents waiting in the wings for those movies to be revealed as reborn versions of  The Ten Commandments  or Heston's  The Planet of the Apes .  Just how bitter was their disappointment do you think?  Or how about the sense of betrayal of the audiences who had waited in line, paid good money, and suffered through to the end thinking,"It's just GOT to get better..."  Then there are those wonderful occasions when an amazing film blindsides you when you're not even expecting to stay awake for it.  Cases in point:  The People vs. Larry Flynt , the previously mentioned  Run, Lola, Run , and two films that I watched initially as in-flight movies,  The Last of the Blonde Bombshells  and  Living Out Loud .  (A word to the wise who haven't figured this out already: They do edit movies for in-flight use.  Expect the unexpected when you rent the same film later.)  So the question stands to be answered: Is it worth it to have expectations at all?  Is it worth the risk of disappointment, embarrassment and thinly veiled outrage?  Does having one film meet or exceed your most ambitious imaginings (2003's  Peter Pan ) or blow your sense of the world out the proverbial window ( Donnie Darko  ) or expand your mind in a discourse of self ( Artificial Intelligence ) or make you laugh until your kidneys burst (Legally Blonde - the first one, not the sequel) or all of the above negate all those poorly executed, shabbily produced, bile-inducing money-grabs?  For me, I will continue to have expectations because, honestly, although I still begrudge several hours of my life to movies that wasted money and energy as well as time, I have more memories of films that pleasantly surprised me with wit, intelligence, and/or aesthetic ingenuity.  While that balance remains in favour of positive experiences, I will continue to hold great, but cautious, expectations.

						   Just to make it clear to those who don't know me personally:  I am a Harry Potter fan .  Picked up the book due to early buzz and have been hooked ever since.  I've been a shameless whore to the marketers and own an embarrassing number of collectors' cards, socks, binders, stickers, and other sundry.  This habit isn't helped by the encouragement and generosity of friends who lie upon a continuum of "fan"aticism from amused to near delusional (you know who you are). Second note to those reading: this post contains spoilers for both the newest movie, based on my favourite book of the series so far,  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , and the fifth and newest book,  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . So, with a little help from my friends, old and new, I caught a midnight screening of the new movie on June 3.  The movies up until now have been efficient, faithful adaptations of the books, enjoyable for the physical actualization of things like Quidditch and Mandrakes, but disappointing in terms of acting, cinematography, and overall motion picture value.  (Note: I do own both on DVD, despite these critiques)  However, unlike the Star Wars prequels, these mild disappointments did not lower my expectations going into this film.  New director, cast additions such as Michael Gambon and Gary Oldman, and the chance to see Buck Beak had me excited and ready to be impressed. And for the most part, I was.  The acting of the main three has improved immensely from the first movie (although I'm sure Rupert Grint is sick of saying "Brilliant!") and the new cast members portrayed their characters beautifully.  Buck Beak was stupendous as were the effects used to animate the Marauders' Map, to create the Dementors and to illustrate invisible Harry and gynormous Hagrid.  Even Lupin's transformation was seamless.  It was great fun to see so many of the students in the midst of growth spurts - Neville and Draco in particular - and the nerdy nit-picker in me noted how both the Whomping Willow and Hagrid's Hut have been moved to new locations on the grounds of Hogwarts.  What left me wondering and wanting was the omission of the identities of the Marauders.  It seems like such a key point to the story and would have added so much for those who haven't read the books (shame on ALL of you) and would have deprived rabid fans like myself of a major sticking point for the film.  It wouldn't have taken long to explain just how close Sirius, James, Remus and Peter were, why they took the names they used on the Map, and why it was that Harry's Patronus took the shape it did.  The screenwriter, Steven Kloves, used an exposition device at the end of  Philosopher's Stone  to explain why Voldemort couldn't stand to touch Harry.  The same device could've been wielded carefully to do the same this time to explain how James WAS protecting Harry by the lake.  Other little things like Prof. Trelawney's portrayal and the lack of Flobberworms irked a little but didn't really amount to a true want. A good friend (let's call her Princess Y) emailed me with a great question:  What was your favourite line(s) from the movie?  She had listed two Hermione quotes: "Come get the nice, dead ferret." and "I'm saving your life, you idiot." (although, I don't remember the "you idiot" part myself) I responded with a few of my own (which I'll list below along with more that I've remembered since) and I invite any readers to comment on theirs once they've seen the movie. Despite his very few scenes as a human, Gary Oldman truly stole the show with what I believe to be his most low-key character ever (I mean, really, the man has portrayed Beethoven, Dracula, and that crazy weapons dealer in  The Fifth Element , you'd think his giant Grim-like dog Animagus, Sirius Black, would be over-the-top too)  I freely admit my bias on this point as Sirius has been my favourite character (with Lupin running a close second and Mad-Eye a distant third) since  Prisoner of Azkaban . Therefore, I confess to crying when he died in the  Order of the Phoenix  and to compulsively visiting Rowling's new site to see if she's answered the question on the FAQs Poll: "Is Sirius Black really dead?"  ( http://www.jkrowling.com )  I encourage everyone to vote for it too so that she answers it.  You may also notice that most of my quotes (sometimes paraphrased) are Sirius'.  Ultimately, my love of Sirius probably held Oldman to a higher standard than the rest of the cast.  (He met and surpassed it, by the way.  Too bad he didn't get more screen time.)   Favourite Film Quotes From  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    "Professor Lupin is having a tough night." - Harry  "Come on, Harry, and join the big boys." - Weasley twins  "Severus, don't be a fool!" (Lupin) "He can't help his nature" (Black) "Once again, Severus, you've taken all the evidence available and come to completely the wrong conclusion....Go and play with your chemistry set." (Black)  "My nature as a dog is really quite [friendly]. James once suggested I make the change permanent. The tail, I could handle, but the fleas were murder." - Black  "Is that really..." (Harry) "Yep...Dumbledore...in his office...pacing...He does that a lot." (Weasley twins)  "Now I would like a cup of tea or a large brandy." - Dumbledore  "You won't find any small cups in this house." - Hagrid  "Looks more like a pig with fur." - Ron  "What frightens you the most?" (Lupin) "mumble" (Neville) "What was that?" (Lupin) "Professor Snape" (Neville) "Yes, well I suppose he frightens a lot of us...you live with your grandmother, I believe?" (Lupin) "Yes, but I don't want her to come out of that cupboard either!" (Neville)  "Eat this.  Chocolate.  It'll make you feel better." (Lupin)  "Messrs Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs respectfully greet Professor Snape and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business." - Harry reading from the Marauders' Map  "My dear, from the moment you entered this room, I sensed you did not possess the correct spirit for the art of divination.  Ah yes, your years may be young but your soul is as shriveled and dry as the books to which you desperately cleave." - Trelawney  "You really are the greatest witch of your age." - Black

						   Okay, I haven't seen the movie although I have a sneaking suspicion that I own it... But the title is appropriate to my last couple of days.  First off, my cell phone goes missing on Friday, effectively cutting me off from most of my friends who have gotten new phone numbers in the last few months (or longer).  I misplace stuff all the time so I wasn't too worried on Saturday morning when I went to look for it before work.  When I got home, I called it from my landline figuring I'd hear it and all would be well.  No buzz.  So I check the car.  Nothing.  Check all my pockets, all my bags.  Nada.  Sunday, I report it lost and have the SIM card disabled.  Monday, I worry.  Tuesday, the first day my Friday workplace is open again, I call.  They haven't seen it.  I drive there on Tuesday afternoon and go to every store in the mall and plaza and the gas station on the corner to see if anyone turned it in.  Hope flickers a couple of times and dies.  Then, like a black-and-white flashback in a murder mystery movie, I remember the two boys on bikes by my car when I was paying for gas after work on Friday.  Maybe those little punks got into my car and took it!  But wait, quick on the heels of that image is the heavy bag of garbage I threw out Saturday morning.  What if it had fallen in the garbage the previous night?  And then there's the image of the phone colliding with anti-matter and blinking into nothingness.    So if anyone comes across a Motorola V60g in a black leather case with a clip, give me a shout will you?

						   Wow, blogger's changed stuff in the last 20 hours... hmm, anyway, here's the media commentary that I submitted today. Enjoy! &nbsp; In examining the front page of a recent edition of a national daily newspaper, I was interested to note that three of the five headlines were concerned with women or girls.&nbsp; The largest and boldest headline was regarding the search for a five-year-old who has gone missing, possibly abducted from her own bed.&nbsp; The next reported on the trial of a twenty-one-year-old who stands accused of beating and killing a fourteen-year-old seven years ago.&nbsp; (Incidentally, the victim in the case was female too.)&nbsp; The last headline, printed in font not much bigger than the body text, stated that a certain successful businesswoman feels “lonely” at the top.&nbsp;  Are these the faces of &nbsp;“girl power”? I wondered.&nbsp; Victims, violent offenders, and, for those of achievement, isolation?&nbsp; As a high-school teacher and as a woman, this question was disturbing.&nbsp; What sorts of role models are “legitimate” media like news agencies offering young women seeking independence and self-reliance?&nbsp; Do they equate female fame with infamy?&nbsp; Are they perpetuating the unspoken message that, to be successful in a career, women should expect to go it alone?&nbsp; Exacerbating this troubling impression is the feeling among many researchers that what most girls, socialized to depend on relationships, fear most is isolation and loneliness.&nbsp; How then can they be expected to make choices that would seemingly lead to a life of solitude and separation?  Turning to the popular media that permeates so much of teenage existence, we are confronted with an incarnation of “girl power” that has been appropriated, reshaped, repackaged and then marketed back to the masses as a key ingredient in the Ultimate Female Formula.&nbsp; In the music world, from Spice to Spears, “girl power” has become synonymous with a sexualized innocence, manipulative intelligence, and the “right” to be a bitch.&nbsp; In the typical blockbuster movies, female leads serve to feed the male ego as romantic partners (Meg Ryan in any of her romantic comedies), evil seductresses (Kathryn in  Cruel Intentions ), unfeminine (and therefore undesirable) adversaries (Ursula in Disney’s  The Little Mermaid ), and butt-kicking sex icons (Sigourney Weaver in the  Alien  movies).&nbsp; Teen magazines devote themselves to self-improvement schemes – exercise regimes, diets, makeovers, fashion tricks – always feeding that sense of never being thin / pretty / popular / fashionable enough.&nbsp; Ironically, these publications are financed by ads that, if all their claims were true, would put said magazines out of business.&nbsp; In the popular media, true “girl power” has become warped: sexuality has become promiscuity; ambition has become frigidity; and self-empowerment has become a threat to society.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of “girl power” had noble beginnings.&nbsp; The idea that everything that makes Woman different from Man – biology, psychology, neurology – could also make her as strong, if not stronger, was an epiphany too long in coming.&nbsp; But, like the dream that loses its substance upon waking, “girl power” somehow lost its meaning and became more concerned with men than women.&nbsp; In a society cored in patriarchy, it seems even female empowerment must be dictated in male terms.

						   Wow, I've been lax on keeping on top of this blog.  Let's fill some stuff in.  If you haven't been to the DVD list recently, I've created a new collection site with DVD Profiler (credit to the bro for hooking me up with that) and the link is in  urlLink here  as well as in the DVD list and the URL (couldn't link - sorry) is in my little blurb up top.  Having directed you to my collection, let me introduce you to my DVD god,  urlLink Dave  whose collection renders me speechless and comforts me in that I am NOT the weirdest collector out there. As for films, I sat down and watched (my borrowed copy of) Sofia Coppola's  The Virgin Suicides  the other night.  Finally, a film that doesn't make me want to throttle Kirsten Dunst.  She actually contributes to this beautifully shot film, playing her version of MJ Watson in a context that it actually suits.  I was surprised at the number of well-known actors in the cast (Kathleen Turner, James Woods, Danny DeVito, and Giovanni Ribisi come to mind) and amused at the number of Coppolas involved in the film's production.  I read the book two or three summers ago and, although the exact action of the literature has escaped me, the film leaves me with the same sense of quietude that I remember from the reading. As for reading, I'm deep in the anguish of Rachel Simmons' masterwork,  Odd Girl Out .  I don't read non-fiction very often, preferring to lose myself in moments of leisure in a fantasy or romance or comic.  Thus, it took me a long time, despite many sincere recommendations, to acquire this book and still longer to start it.  It's a study of girl bullying, alternate aggressions as Simmons phrases it, and is filled with anecdotes of the cruelty that girls visit upon each other in the "accepted" forms of interaction.  Reading this, I have at times been seized by the bitterness and rage at incidents I have endured.  At other times, I have cringed at the hurt I may have caused.  Many girls find themselves in both the role of victim and as the bully in different contexts and different times in their lives.  It all boils down to power and the image of "nice".  Simmons argues that girls resort to manipulation as the ultimate marriage of power and passivity and I couldn't agree more.  What I've read so far has affected me deeply and also assisted me in a school assignment.... Ah, school... bane and boon of my existance!  The testing arena of masochism!  Sought-after and despised centre of exquisite pain... These three week courses may yet trigger my descent into mad ennui.  Today marked the halfway point of this half-semester.  Tomorrow, I have assignments due in both the courses I'm in now.  One is a media commentary which, if it stills makes sense when I wake up, may be posted to this blog later tomorrow.  I chose to write on "girl power" in the media.  The other assignment is a presentation on a historical site I visited on the weekend.  Everything seems to be ready.  Then the work begins.  One class requires me to write a 12-16 page study guide for a film.  I thought I'd do  The Red Violin  but discovered that I'm not so innovative as I thought since others have thought of that also.  I think I'm settled on  Canadian Bacon , mentioned oh so briefly in the previous post, brought to mind by my pilgrimage to  Farenheit 9/11  (which I plan on seeing again this weekend).  The genius of this choice is that the study guide would then lead directly and seemingly flawlessly into the major project in the other class.  It's amazing how clear everything is when one is starting to fall asleep. Yesterday, my world was touched by the merciful hand of a mortal goddess currently employed as a custodian at the university.  My cell phone, which faithful readers will recall was a replacement for one that disapparated six weeks ago, was not with me when I returned home yesterday evening.  After alternate fits of despair and anxiety and a failed bidding attempt to buy a new one on Ebay, I resolved to retrace my steps at school first thing in the morning.  Cognizant of the slim-to-none chance of a good hearted passer-by finding my phone, figuring out my phone number, and calling me, I retreated in deep depression to bed.  At 9pm, the call came.  An accented voice, female and hesitant,"I'm calling from UBC."  I must have frightened her with my shrill and astounded,"Are you calling about my cell phone?"  Within the hour, I had met this 5'4" saviouress, meagerly offering a box of chocolates and an enthusiastic hug in thanks for the relief and restoration of human goodness (and the phone of couse) she had restored to me.  Although I have been forbidden to name any children after her, all my future Good Samaritans will bear the name, Tootsa.

						   Did you know Michael Moore wrote, produced and acted in (Redneck Protester #2) that diamond of cinematic genius,  Canadian Bacon ?  I found this out only shortly before going in to see  Fahrenheit 9/11 . I'm declaring my bias before entering into this post.  I do not like George W. Bush.  He is evil.  He is ignorant.  He makes rocks look smart and my mother look politically savvy (the irony here is that she is probably his most ardent non-voting supporter).  He's what monsters fear is hiding under their beds at night.  And the best (and shortest) joke I've heard with him as its butt (and there are many, both good and bad) is:  George W. Bush was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.   Having said all that, I feel comfortable in saying that  Farenheit 9/11  rocked my world with tremors of outrage, incredulity, tears, and laughter.  Moore does something here that I had heard he was capable of but wasn't sure he would pull off.  He creates an entertaining documentary of irrefutable facts that most rational movie-goers cannot help but give credence too.  He appeals to human emotion and sympathy.  He plays on a sense of injustice and irony.  He plays the innocent child to Emperor Bush's New Clothes and lays bare the unbelieveable wrongs that have been visited upon the people of the USA and the world by the Dubya administration and the media that has supported this regime.  He damns them all with their own words. I went to see this film with colleagues from school, all of us being Social Studies teachers and, thus, we all felt both a professional and personal need to see it.  Afterwards, there was so much to talk about and yet so much more to think about.  How do we explain the travesty of the War of Terrorism to our students knowing what we know now?  How can we instill any faith in the judicial and political systems of the world when we feel so cynical and jaded ourselves?   Moore leaves hope alive with his unspoken message that a democracy can work if the people of the country step up to the polls and make it work.  Good luck, Yanks! The rest of this post is shamelessly stripped from Moore's  urlLink website  which I recommend all readers visit regularly   How about Letterman’s Top Ten List: “Top Ten George W. Bush Complaints About "Fahrenheit 9/11":   10. That actor who played the President was totally unconvincing  9. It oversimplified the way I stole the election  8. Too many of them fancy college-boy words  7. If Michael Moore had waited a few months, he could have included the part where I get him deported  6. Didn't have one of them hilarious monkeys who smoke cigarettes and gives people the finger  5. Of all Michael Moore's accusations, only 97% are true  4. Not sure - - I passed out after a piece of popcorn lodged in my windpipe  3. Where the hell was Spider-man?  2. Couldn't hear most of the movie over Cheney's foul mouth  1. I thought this was supposed to be about dodgeball    This movie is perhaps the most thoroughly researched and vetted documentary of our time. No fewer than a dozen people, including three teams of lawyers and the venerable one-time fact-checkers from The New Yorker went through this movie with a fine-tooth comb so that we can make this guarantee to you. Do not let anyone say this or that isn't true. If they say that, they are lying. Let them know that the OPINIONS in the film are mine, and anyone certainly has a right to disagree with them. And the questions I pose in the movie, based on these irrefutable facts, are also mine. And I have a right to ask them. And I will continue to ask them until they are answered.

						   It's official.  I hate her again.   Vancouver Province,  Aug 10, 2003, B7    Dunst wonders if Spidey should die after third flick Should Spider-Man be killed off? Don't laugh.  Kirsten Dunst, who plays Mary jane Watson, the long-suffering firlfriends of Peter Parker (a.k.a. Spidey) in the hit film series, thinks this might be a good idea. "It would actually be really interesting if Spider-Man died," she says.  She figures it's time for the movies to break from convention.  "Why doesn't the superhero ever die?  It would be so sad and beautiful.  I think if mary Jane was alone and pregnant and he dies, dhe could give birth to a Spider-Baby and carry on the series with another young boy." Still, Dunst admits she may be going too far in promoting such a scenario. "I was getting really morbid there for a second. But I don't know what will happen in the third movie."  She does figure that Mary Jane should stay alive.  "I hope she doesn't die.  I don't know."  She figures everything will depend on whether there will be more Spider-Man movies after the third, which means that Mary Jane's future is up for grabs: "We have to end it - so let's just kill her." Dunst is now contracted to do the third movie and she says she never worried about Mary Jane being written out of the series. "They don't want to lose their only girl." she smiles.  "They're not stupid." -CanWest News Service    ...but you certainly are, aren't you?  Boy, by all rights, stupidity like that should be painful.

						   With a little positive reinforcement from a friend, I've decided to go back to my trend of movie titles. Out of habit as I am, it took a good fifteen minutes to work one out for this post. The movie is one I have seen, a cute movie, chick-flick through and through, but with heart-warming performances by the eight leads, a hodge-podge of young and middle-aged female celebs - Thora Birch, Rosie O'Donnell, Christina Ricci, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore, Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife), Gaby Hoffman (Costner's daughter in  Field of Dreams ), and Ashleigh Aston Moore (??). The relevance of the title is in how my world order changed today when two good friends of mine (see positive reinforcement mention above) who've been a couple for over ten years, more married in attitude than most aisle-walkers I know, dropped by to flash me with a diamond solitaire set on a white-gold band. The intensity of the news is heightened by familiarity with their history. To quote the Y-chromosome in question from a discussion of marriage a few years back,"I'm nervous about the idea of marriage, while [she's] just plain paranoid." That being said, she's now committed to actually getting married sometime in the next FOUR years... Her words upon being proposed to? "I kind of expected this but just not so soon!" As they're still in the process of informing friends (family having been dealt with in the usual smooth and seamless way), and assuming that I wasn't the LAST person to be told, I'll leave their names out of it for the time being. My congratulations are heart-felt - it's quite the achievement on both their parts. However, their news has made me think about the many changes that have taken place over the last few years. To begin with, weddings have come to be regular events lately. I'm attending one in under two weeks, another in six weeks. More than half the people in my program at school were either engaged or already married. My circle of friends has already spawned about a dozen offspring, with another two on the way. My mother, in typical contradictory style, has repeatedly announced her readiness to be a grandmother. (For some reason, my brother has not taken the hint.) I have peers in Master's and Doctoral programs, professional degree programs, and some already secure in a career-path job. Many have finished at least one degree. Some have bought homes. Several have bought vehicles. Most have to get up in the morning to work. I'm two years away from my ten-year highschool reunion. I'm almost halfway to early retirement, if I can afford to take it. "Early retirement" has entered my vocabulary. And how is Now different from Then? Well, over the last ten years: I've been engaged I've broken that engagement I've committed to a new relationship My parents have divorced My father re-married and had three new daughters (not exactly in that order) My mother moved to the States, got engaged, and had plastic surgery (in that order) My brother graduated high school, started school at Berkeley, developed "massive pectoral muscles" (ditto) My cousins have finished school, returned to school, gone to work and planned for more school (variations on a theme) My grandmother has passed away I have been in three car accidents and bought a car I have moved four times (not counting in and out of res) My friends have been having babies, getting married, buying homes, travelling, and coming home I have made new friends, renewed old friendships, bid some friendships farewell, and let others fade into memory I have travelled on three different continents I have finished (nearly) two degrees, worked ten different jobs (sometimes four at a time), and put myself tens of thousands of dollars into debt (On a related note, I have learned innumberable ways to procrastinate, perfected the all-nighter, and acquired hundreds of DVDs)  Since "the only constant is change", and I've been consistantly erratic in the last few years, I expect that I'm missing a lot on my list. Furthermore, I think keeping track is probably useless since it'll all be different in another ten years, when babies over take weddings, travelling will be more about going home than going away, and debt management becomes a thing of the past (please God please). A lottery win or two would be nice too.

						   So true. Ask anyone.  urlLink        Sleeping Beauty  You sleep a lot, but at least you have those cool lil fairies by your side.   Take the quiz:   urlLink  "What Disney Princess Are You?"    FINALLY, someone else can see the fairies...

						   So last night was the Bachelor of Education's One-Year program's grad dinner/dance. A fine time was had by all. Except my feet. One of my buddies had to head out early but I held the other hostage since I was her ride home... fat lot of good that did me since her boyfriend is apparently higher priority than me. It was pretty amazing seeing everyone done up all fancy. We're such slobs at school usually. Dinner was yummy and the  urlLink DJ  rawked the house, despite some rather diverse requests from the rather diverse members of the crowd. That leaves five more school days before I bid UBC farewell after a love-hate relationship of EIGHT years... Three actual class days since we're doing presentations for the last two... wow. And yet, instead of rushing towards the light, I'm once again dragging my heels. Subconsciously, there must be a conversation going on that sounds something like this: "Wow, five more days and then we're free!" "Yeah, but there's still those two assignments." "Really?" "Yeah, and one was due last Friday. The prof is cool though. We can hand it in on Monday." "Two assignments?" "Yeah, we need to do some research for this one. It's worth 50% of the course mark." "Last Friday?" "Yeah. If we get to it after Melissa's bridal shower tomorrow, we might have it mostly done by the time Brendan gets home." "But we need to clean the apartment." "True. But we need to hand it in on Monday." "Yeah, but it's only four pages and there's a template." "...which you haven't word-processed yet." "...which shouldn't take that long." "...which still requires research." "...which shouldn't be that hard." "And there's still the assignment to present." "Whatever, that'll be easy..." "We've got no idea what we're doing for it, do we?" "True, but presentations go better on a wing and a prayer." "We're going for a B. Ed. not a B. S." "pfft" "PFFT" "Oh, yeah?" "Yeah." "Fine." "FINE." As y'all can tell, I'm being VERY productive. I predict that ANYONE could call me @ 4am PST on Monday morning and they would get a groggy but still conscious me to chat at. Note: that's a COULD not a SHOULD. As for miscellaneous news: As I've been habitatually single for the last twelve days, with Brendan away on a band tour, I've come to the conclusion that I'm very bad at living on my own. The apartment's a mess, the laundry's overflowing, there's nearly no food in the fridge (Mom'll like that), I've been eating take-out crap for the last five days (she won't like that), and my butt has made a permanent Homer Simpson-like groove in the couch. Getting into the supportive undergarments for my dress on Friday was an exercise in self-loathing. On a different topic, I've found a reason to buy a "female urinary director" from MEC. (and it's not for me) I'm planning on running away to Seattle for a couple of days in late August. Not only are there three Hot Topic stores en route, but Pike Place apparently has Starbucks Store #1 and they have their own Starbucks card only available at Store #1. I've weaned myself off of the daily Venti Soy Tazo Chais, but I'm hankering to complete my collection of Starbucks cards. The Vancouver Fringe Festival line-up seems to be shaping up nicely. Now, if they'd only release the goddamn program... For the ST:tNG fans out there... check  urlLink this  out. For the words of wisdom of Emperor Bush II, take  urlLink this test . Or any of the previous ones. And for everyone I didn't already email this to,  urlLink I like you.  No, I don't know what the characters mean.

						   So I followed in my little bro's footsteps and ordered some shirts from the hilarious independent media website  urlLink www.goats.com .  I ordered the  urlLink second  one on this page.  It used to be first but now they're pushing the zombie peanut butter one which I don't think is nearly as funny and intellectually stimulating, but that might just be me.  I wore it to school yesterday and some extras from the shooting of  Tru Calling  that was on campus yesterday commented on it, thinking I was actually Republican.  I'm still a little taken aback that the entire world does not recognize the name Voldemort yet.  Can it be that some are still willfully blind to the world of Harry Potter?  No, I must be hallucinating again... I wore it again today and found it interesting how comfortable one is (one being female) with having strangers and passer-byers stare at one's chest if said chest is sporting an eye-catching statement.  My brother's had fewer comments on his shirt, even though he's actually in the States... but I've got a more attractive chest, I guess.  I think I'll wear my George Dubya American Psycho shirt tomorrow... There's a store in Vancouver that will turn any image you bring in into an iron-on tranfer for a shirt.  My plan before November 2nd (US election day if you didn't know) is to have one made with Joe Wezorek's " urlLink War President " portrait and the caption "Just Imagine... 4 more years".  The portrait is a mosaic made up of American military who have died in Iraq.  The portrait was created in April and the pics had to be repeated to complete the photo.  The tragic thing is that if Joe were to make one today, he wouldn't need to repeat any.  I'm not sure what brought it on, but politics has become huge in my life this year.  Canadian, American, global.  I voted for the first time and, y'know what?, I think I'll do it again for the provincial election because, God knows, if B.C. had an equivalent to Dubya, Gordon Campbell would be it!

						   So I'm two weeks (nine days, really) away from the end of this professional program of teacher education.  In a way, I'm impressed.  Impressed with the idea of completing such an intense and poorly-planned program with my sanity relatively intact.  Impressed with my long term plans which include overseas teaching, professional development, California schools, a New Hampshire prep school and a possible Master's degree.  Impressed with friends who have already secured classrooms (or theatres, in some cases) for September.  On another level, I'm relieved.  Relieved that I didn't blow this all off somewhere in May.  Relieved that I'm now ostensibly employable.  Relieved that the word "career" doesn't strike terror into my core.  Then there's the uncertainty of travel, finances, relationships, and employment.  But mostly, I'm tired.  All the discipline and motivation I started this program with in September is G-O-N-E.  Just certify me, dammit! Today, I've got an assignment to do, an apartment to clean, and this overwhelming urge to eat. I got home late last night from a weekend in L.A. with maternal family and the bro.  We did Universal Studios, a family dinner to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries, some mall-hopping, and... oh what family gathering would be complete without political strife and some nice psychological baggage to top it off!  No time to vent now... need to try and work.

						   So, here I am after weeks of non-inspiration... and I'm gakking (usage?) a Buffy quiz...   I am   Drusilla    "Your face is a poem. I can read it."    urlLink What "Buffy" Character Are You?     ...although, as a teacher, I think I love Giles' quote best:    "You should never be cowed by authority. Except, of course, in this instance, where I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong."
