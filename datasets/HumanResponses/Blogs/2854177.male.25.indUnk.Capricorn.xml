      Read the  urlLink Slate article  of the same name.  I am glad to be a bunny-hugging vegetarian -- though I will  not  pontificate on why anyone else should be.  I really miss meat sometimes.  And leather.

      I checked out how  urlLink Google  finds their sites a week or two ago.  Apparently, they have some kind of "spiders" (digital ones, I hope) that crawl the web and report back once a month.  Sometimes, a site will get listed within its first month and sometimes not, since the spiders don't get to the whole net in a month.  Well, if you  urlLink search on Google for Blog Collective , we are there now.  Check out the link.  Too bad we are fourth down.  Maybe we can get the domain one day:)

      I will never forget reading Marx and his theory that religion is the opiate of the masses.  Chilling thought at this day in age, isn't it?    One area of religion that I have a very difficult time with is this idea that even though Priests, Fathers, Mothers, whatever the designated leader, they teach their followers several different and conflicting lessons.  One, they teach us to treat others the way we would be treated, yet in the same breath we condemn those who would and do hold different beliefs than those we believe in.  And if they do not hold the same beliefs that we do, then they are evil and we must save them.    Two, the bible is not a direct translation, rather an interpretation of those who were "disciples" of Jesus, yet they treat it as the divine truth etc, yada, yada.  As we all know interpretation is sujective, as is most observation in this world.  We all have different world views, we all bring a different perspective to the table depending on how, who, where and what happened to us while we were growing up and forming these world views.    Three, do people, sorry but specifically Catholics and evangelists, really think that with the total population on earth being 6,375,882,069 that he/she/it (I personally like to remember Alanis Morrisette in Dogma as god) really has time to keep track of every single one of our alleged transgressions?!  What kind of hubristic, self-centeredness are they catering too?  Talk about feeding your ego!! I don't care how prescient he/she/it is.

      Frankie, I definitely agree with you about religions zeal being more tolerated in public.  However, I think the public is tolerant of mostly western religions.  Since most of the Bush, Ashcroft, Cheney rhetoric is focusing on the evil that is out there (read this as religious evil from those who do not belong to westernized faiths) this is a huge problem that only perpetuates stereotypes and hate.    In addition, I think that the Catholic church is most welcoming of this controversy becuase they are hoping that A) it is going to take the attention away from the fact that they are housing child molesters and B) that they are housing child molesters.  There is a huge case going on in Albany right now that involves the Bishop as well as a dead priest, who made accusations before he died (very questionable).    Finally, I think that this movie is emphasizing the wrong part of Jesus' life.  It is a depiction of the last 12 hours of his life, in addition to having a very bloody, 30 minute crucifixtion scene.  So graphic that a woman in Ohio went to a screening of the film and, during the aforementioned scene, had a heart attack and subsequently died.  I think, especially recently, there has been enough violence everywhere, not only in our country but around the world and there is no way that I am going to knowingly subject myself to more violence.

      Regardless of whether or not you believe that Nietzsche's charge of  ressentiment  against Christianity is true or not (he says that the values of life were reversed by weak people who couldn't be strong and good and that they turned it into a religion), you should be wary of what  some  Christians try to say to non-Christians, since the feeling one gets at times wherein one wants to be a part of a group can be very strong, and since evangelists play on this all the time.  I think that religion is an inherently personal phenomena.  Is the goal of religion to feel like you are a part of a community of faith, or a part of the divine?  Does a church make you a Christian; and does being a Christian make you religious; and does being religious make you good; and is being good the goal of human life?    My mother had a wise point last week.  She said that she walked out of the hospital in Baltimore from a diabetes check-up, and the sun was shining over a warm afternoon in the middle of winter.  She said that if you can't feel "g[G]od then, when can you?"  I think that connection with the divine is personal in this way.  If the sun on your face or birds singing outside of your window don't connect you with something bigger than yourself (and I personally prefer not to say "God," since that has ramifications that I am not comfortable with, given the disparity between my own beliefs about the world and human life and the beliefs of those who "believe in God"), then what will?  I believe that some people cannot get this feeling on their own.  Either they are not very smart, not very reflective, not very observant or just plain weak (I don't know, though I suspect it is the middle two).  But  some  people  need  church and organized religion in order to feel connected with the divine, if they desire such a connection.    But there are others who are able to connect  directly  with the divine, without a priest, church or faith to come between them and interpret it for them and tell them all kinds of cognitive things about what their God wants them to do.  There are people who can connect with the divine (or cosmos, or whole universe, or whatever you want to call it) on their own.  Problems such as the churches here in the Heartland buying tickets to Mr. Gibson's film for non-believers (to save them) arise when narrow-minded believers (which is not to say  all  believers) assume that we all need churches to interpret the divine for us.  They assume that there is a language of the divine that only people in robes can understand and translate for the masses.  And they assume that we are all part of the masses.  I would try to accept the fact that not everyone needs a church to be "religious" and that there are those of us who lead meaningful, fulfilling and ethical lives without the help of a church.  I agree with Max Scheler, that western thought places far too much weight on our cognitive abilities.  Perhaps if you find "doors of perception" which are not rational, you might find your god or spirit or One or whatever you want to call she/he/it.  Take a notebook (to record your experiences) and sit outside with some tea or coffee; smell the air; look into the sky; run your hands in the cool water of a stream and over the rough skin of a maple tree; watch how the squirrel knows how to climb and find food and survive the winter; let bugs crawl over your feet as it you were a part of it all.  You'll  feel  what church is meant to connect you with, I am certain of it.

      I'm wondering if anyone else is as disturbed as I am over the hoopla surrounding the new Mel Gibson movie. Around here, churches are buying blocks of tickets and are hoping to use the film as a teaching tool. I'll admit that I haven't seen the movie--only read reviews and articles about the charges of anti-Semitism; one of my professors wants our class to see it because it coincides with something on our syllabus, but I must say I really don't want to. I think what repulses me is the way in which this film has been taken up by Christians as some demonstration of the rightness of their faith, of their own superiority (look, "Braveheart" agrees with us!). Ever since I became a "recovering Catholic," I have become increasingly uncomfortable with outward expressions of religious faith by other people. Maybe I think they're trying to convert me; maybe I'm paranoid about what they'd say if they knew I was currently between churches; maybe I'm jealous because I don't have a church or faith to belong to. I do know that I'm suspicious of the ways in which Christian zeal can become intolerance for other people's beliefs.  Do other people feel this way? Ever since 9/11, it seems, religious rhetoric has been increasingly tolerated in public discourse, even by the prez. himself.  It's probably not surprising, then, that nobody has noticed what Joe pointed out in an earlier post here, that the gay marriage debate is really a religious issue, that if we observed the church-state separation, we'd realize that all the state has the power to do is authorize civil unions because that's all straight couples ever get.  I'd appreciate any thoughts on this.

      I don't necessarily think that the Kerry site is the best place to get information about the truth behind what the man stands for (maybe better for a general idea or something like that).  From what it reads like, he is only saying what the people want to hear about national policies.  It's not going to be hard to tell the people what to do as the next prez...pretty much the opposite of what dubbya is doing recently.  I'm going to vote for him though, it's not that I'm saying anything along those lines...but it just seems a little general the things that he said about "What needs to be done to fix our Great Nation".  I think that anyone who payed a little attention to the way things have been going in the past few years can make up a list of what needs to be done to repair the damage of "W".

      I thought I would be more...constructive than my usual Bush-bashing (since he shames himself enough, as seen with his ssslllooowww talking when he announced his [anti-]constitutional amendment yesterday) today.    Here is  urlLink John Kerry's blog  (also under Links).  Interesting.  Also, on his  urlLink site  (also under Links), you can download the form that is, according to Kerry's site, "the one document that allows you to register to vote from anywhere in the United States"  urlLink here .  I am still registered in Maryland, so I won't get to vote in the Illinois primary.  It's my own fault for not thinking about it sooner.  This will not be so in November, however.

      first of all, i like starting my inputs here as a letter.  there's a reason for that and i think that pragmatik would love to hear it but not right now. my father consistently asks me to pray for good things because it worked for him.  i think it's not too much to ask, but he once got me a "wwjd" bible bookmark for christmas.  i think that i have it too now but only out of respect for the old fucker.  i really need to pay more attention to what's going on in the country.  i didn't know that dubbya was dumb enough to actually make a public statement of such ignorism (sp?) saying that gays are bad.   i know that i'm not the only person that will go down saying and thinking that he's the worst thing to happen to our country (leader wise) for a long time.  i'd like to know the number of republicans and dead presidents that are rolling over everytime he steps up to a microphone.   didn't really make a point today but wtf...i'm just following in the steps of my leaders and talking without making reason.

      I have been waiting for Blogger to get their advanced (i.e., not free) stuff back up and running.  If they take too long, what do you think about this other provider,  urlLink Typepad ?  Lots of people whose blogs I like use it, but we would need the Pro version.  I think I could pay for it.  On the other hand, I really like Blogger, and I kinda want to wait and see what they can do to let us put pictures on the site (and so we can keep things on the server they are on).  What do ya'll think?  Please write to the blog email address (under CONTACT US) to register your thoughts. urlLink    Danke.

      He lied: This morning, there was a report about a recent press release from the White House in which the President reported that Americans are becoming healthier overall.  However, he did not provide statistics on any "minority" groups.  I put the quotations in because for the most part at the rate these groups are growing in the United States they will soon be majority groups rather than continue to be subordinate due to the continued domination of the White "majority".  ARRRGGGG...this is so frustrating.  How can he just fucking ignore entire populations like this?  I will find the link for you guys later.  Right now I am late for a meeting.    Ciao

      Sorry to hear about your recent experience at the doc, Chris.  Sometimes bedside manner makes more of a difference than a doctor is aware of.  A lot of times, the doctor will try to scare you into doing something they think is good for you (blood tests, etc.), instead of talking to you about it.  Anyway, sounds like you had a difficult experience, and I'm sorry.  However, you should  absolutely not  equate even a positive diagnosis of diabetes (which it doesn't sound like you've had yet) with death, dying, or the end of an active, healthy lifestyle.  It might be the end of an  unhealthy  lifestyle, and you might have to start taking care of yourself, but that's part of getting older anyway.  We're all (I think) getting towards the age where we can't ignore our bodies and maintain full health.  Diabetes runs in my family on my mother's side.  Although my mother has not been diagnosed, diabetes was common in her mother's family.  In terms of Type II, so called "Adult-onset Diabetes," it is serious, but hardly life-threatening in the short term.  Although it can result in long-term health problems, especially when you get older, it's not likely to kill you, especially if properly treated.  Family history is a  major risk factor , as you know, but so are obesity and physical inactivity, which are more controllable.  Basically, you can beat it by being healthy, eating healthy, and getting exercise.  Worst case, you work out a lot and pick up attractive women in bars.  In terms of thoughts about your own mortality, that's a different thing.  No matter what brings them on, it's always a serious time.  I can't say much about that, as it's something we all have to wrestle with ourselves.  But looking moody can work with the ladies... :)

      Our fearful fucking leader just appeared on the news, calling for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage outright nationwide.  Why, oh, why are people so fucking stupid that they will support this idiot and his stupid agendas?  Remember how hundreds of our boys are dying in the desert?  Why is everyone so concerned about some 80-year old lesbians in San Francisco who are finally allowed to get married after being together for over 50 years?  "Oh, God!  Dem fags is gettin' hee-itched.  That jusss ain't rot.  What would Jesus do?"  Jesus would officiate the ceremony and get fucked up afterward with all the nice gay people and then lay in the grass for a nap.    Or he's a pussy, too,  and a terrible leader, and Christianity is a waste of everyone's time and a festering sore on civilization.    Maybe we should adopt the motto "What would Dubya do?"  Ask yourself that, and then do the fucking opposite.

      Hey Chris, I know it's easier said than done not to worry. But like John was saying, genetics matter, but they're not everything. Clearly you take good care of yourself. Doctors get all wiggy about stuff because they can't know that everyone is taking care of themselves the way they should. You're not your family history, which is all your doctor has to go on at this point. It sounds like it's just a test and just a precaution.  You know we're all thinking of you, and you've got a whole address book of folks (including me) you can talk to anytime you need to.

      Chris, it is always scary and never helpful when doctors have that type of attitude.  However, it is also important to remember that you are in good shape and have been taking care of yourself.  I know when my brother was in the hospital for a month for stem cell replacement therapy it was always wonderful to find little things to laugh about.  I remember one day he went into the bathroom and my mother asked him what he was doing, he said shaving, and she totally panicked.  (His hemoglobin count was low and if he had cut himself he might not have been able to stop bleeding)  He came out of the bathroom with a piece of medical tape in his hand and said, "No, mom, look, I'm 'shaving'".  His beard was falling out from the chemo and he was shaving by using the tape to help pull the rest of it out.  It was heartbreaking and hysterical at the same time, and it was great that he could see the humor in that situation as well.    So hang in there and remember that whatever is happening in life, there are still somethings that make us laugh.  (Like J, sending us virtual crack or reading Calvin and Hobbes comic strips- a personal fav of mine) ;)  And remember that I am always here for you.  Laura

      Chris, I am very very sorry to hear about your family history of diabetes and your doctor's reaction.  I don't mean to sound like an ass, but you are  far far  healthier than your dad is, since you take entirely better care of yourself.  You take  extremely  good care of yourself.  You can fight and are fighting your family history.  You are in better shape than anyone I know, and I know a good number of people who are in the military.  Hell, you were in good shape when we were teenagers and you had never thought about the Navy.  If it will make you feel better, have that blood test, and you will see that you are in tip-top condition.    I know it's something to think about (I have a strong family history of diabetes, too, on both sides of my parents), but you should know that you are in better shape than the men in your family who got diabetes -- and that you will be fine.    And on a lighter, but no less true note, read  urlLink this article , which says that coffee can prevent diabetes in men.    And if you are still really freaked out, give me a call anytime, bro.

      So I went to the doctor today for a yearly thing that we do in the Nav.  I was asked about the family history and told the Dr that there's a history of males on my father's side of the family of having Diabetes.  She wasn't happy and recommended that I have the blood test done (the overnight one without eating) and said she was sorry and shook her head a little.  That's not very convincing or helpful to me that the Doc is sad that it's there (the history I mean).  It sort of scared the shit out of me and gave me a reality check.  Don't know where I got the ugre to tell you this but it's important to me.

      I'm posting for the first time, My name's Joe, friend of Johnny's from the Gouch.  And by the way, relating to the issue of gay marriage I think the whole issue is way off.  The court's are not dealing with a holy union, they're dealing with a legal union. For it to be possible for two people people of the same sex to be legally recognized by the state as married is no different from two people of different sexes being legally recognized.  It's not like registering a marriage with the county clerk (or whoever you go to) is some sort of sacrament and Bush is going to go to hell for allowing unholy gays to do it (though, of course, he propbably is going to hell for other reasons.  Which leads to a puzzling digression: which circle of hell do you think he'd go to in Dante's model?)  Why can't religion be left out of purely legal matters?  Religion and the ethics of gay marriage is moot.  Gay couples are not trying to get the government to force the Catholic church to allow them Catholic weddings, but they could benefit from the tax breaks. -joe

      I'd have to admit to showering at least 2 time in a day as well.  Sometimes more depending on what activities I take part in.  I have been frequenting a few humor-ish websites over the past few years and I highly recommend taking a look.  One is " urlLink The Onion ," and the other is  urlLink RedMeat .  It's not a food thing but way off humor in general.  I like Milk Man Dan inparticular...those crazy antics of his.

      He showers more than anyone I've ever met. Seriously. The man likes his cleanliness.  I came across the correct quote from William Lloyd Garrison about the Constitution that I paraphrased earlier. It's "a covenant with death and an agreement with hell."  On the news yesterday, as Dubya was describing how "troubled" he was by the gay marriages in San Francisco, he noted that he believed the people--not the courts--should be able to define what marriage is.  But it was just fine for the Supreme Court to override the popular vote and install you four years ago, wasn't it, Dubya? Man, oh man, I can't wait for November. Register to vote if you aren't already!

      Oh, sorry I haven't posted, I didn't know you were so sensitive....maybe if you showered more often ;)  Anyway, Chris, sorry to hear about the response you got.  I can imagine how frustrating that would be.  I have a friend who lives in NYC and he and I constantly go back and forth about Bush being in office.    I can't believe how much the Euro has dropped.  My brothers were in France over winter break and at that point I think that the Euro was only slightly stronger than the dollar but the value has been dropping all over the world.  Which is not all that surprising when it appears for all intents and purposes that our president thinks he is dealing with Monopoly money.    He's like an overgrown 5 year old.

      I'd like to think that our supremely effective leader, "W", didn't declare war on another nation solely to install a gas station for the fat and rich.  But the fact that the oil industry is flat giving money to the people who voted in favor of the murder of the masses isn't all that suprising.  I sent the link to the "W" doll to a few friends whom I thought would enjoy it and two of them were really good friends from Guam.  They didn't like it and told me and the rest of the democrats to deal with the 4 years because "our" guy fucked it all away for 8 years (sorry for the naughty language ladies).  I was genuinely offended and pissed off at those two for what they said because for one, it isn't that true that Clinton did worse than "W", and two that they couldn't at lease be nice and think of the effects on friendship such comments can have.   One more way that we're getting screwed that you might not know about because of being in America is that all the federal employees are getting "tow-up" over here because of the fact that Europe's not buying any american products, specifically France.  The Euro rate of exchange was intitially equal to 1.10 dollars (good for me).  Now it's a infuriating 75 cents for one Euro.  This is something that a lot of people who aren't in money matters for a job don't know and it's likely thanks to our nation's leader.  Ciao tutti

       urlLink Southern Illinois University Carbondale  has finally decided that our  terrible  website deserves some sprucing up.  By that, I mean that the university has a website now that looks like the website of a research university in 2004 -- and not some Cold War era page about how to fight the Reds.  Seriously, our previous web design looked like it predated the Internet itself, maybe even computers -- or the written word!  The new site is just  so much  of an improvement over the old one that I - I - I - I don't know what to say.  I think I'm going to faint...  No, I didn't faint.  But check out the site.  And check out the Philosophy Department's website in the Links section.  Hee hee hee.  In other SIU-related news,  urlLink they are rebuilding our library .  It is huge (three times the size of O'Neill with two Ls at  urlLink Boston College ), but very ugly.  Again with the Cold War era design.   urlLink Here's a picture  of what it will look like when it is finished.  I won't show you a picture of it now.  Yes, it is  that  ugly.  In  Blog Collective -related news, the cool guy who runs the  urlLink Carbondaley Dispatch  (see Links, "Best Blog in Carbondale") emailed us at the blog's email address.  How cool is that?  His blog is very very very cool,  and you should read it everyday -- even if you don't live in Carbondale.  I read it for months before I lived here.  Seriously.

      Jenna!! Welcome to the blog.  J man- I have to say this was a stellar idea.  Speaking of trafficking victims there was a story in today's  urlLink Times Union , or as my neighbor affectionately refers to it "the times usless," about a man who was stabbed 57 times.  The reason I mention it, is that from all my knowledge he sounds as though he is a trafficking victim, yet nowhere in the article is that mentioned as a possibility.  We really need to spread the word.    Yeah, I think Boston rocks too!! I miss it.  I haven't been there since October.  As for Kerry, while there are some things that I am not necessarily crazy about, he is not Bush and that is all that matters for right now.  However the Dems are not without their own black sheep, did you know that of the 50 Dems who voted on the proposed war in Iraq, those 29 who voted for the war received an average of 7 times more in campaign contributions from the oil industry than the 21 who voted against it?  YIKES!!

       urlLink Trafficking  -- with a K, indeed.  Hee hee hee. :)  Boston going once, my ass.  Where is the deed to the city for my ownership?  I want it!  I want it!  I want it!  Has anyone seen  urlLink Punch Drunk Love ?  What did you think?  I was a little Beer Drunk And In Love when I saw it, but I enjoyed it a lot.  I have a renewed faith in love, I mean, in  urlLink Adam Sandler .  Moleskine is not cruel or skin at all.  Go to the  urlLink Moleskinerie  to see why you need one, and then go  urlLink here  to buy one.  Or two.

      Jenna!  I love Boston, and I miss living there.  If you and this anonymous senator hit it off,  can I have Boston ?  I don't want to be the mayor or anything.  I just want to own the city.  Can you arrange that?  And what is this mutual infatuation about?  It's Valentine's Day!  Go out for dinner!

      Howdy... I just figured this thingy out (I think). I wish I had jumped in earlier! Anyways, I think I know all of you. Or at least met you at Frankie and Johnny's wedding. I only skimmed the previous postings, so I only have a couple of general comments so far. First, Laura, I have a couple of clients right now involved in human trafficing... any specific info you are looking for on the subject? Ridg, how about a job on the state level? I was telling Johnny in an e-mail last night that I am kind of locked into this mutual infatuation with a state senator (we'll not mention his name) right now... so if ANYONE needs something in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, tell me now!! And, yes, Kucinich is definitely funny looking. Gollum-like. But can't the democratic party do any better than KERRY?! As someone who is familiar with him, I can tell you I'm not so impressed with his track record here in MA. We can do better as a nation. I hope. Can't we?!  And moleskin is just cruel.

       urlLink This  is the most  urlLink abominable  (in the truest sense of the word) thing I have ever seen on the internet (since I avoid violent pornography and the like).  It is vile.  These "people" want a monument to commemorate  urlLink Matthew Shepard 's passing into Hell -- as if gay men go to hell when stupid fucking rednecks beat them to death.    Lucky for the evil people who run this website, I have been unable to find their address or whereabouts.  I emailed them, though, and I will post their response.  It should be interesting.  If you want to email them to express your outrage,  urlLink here  is their address.  And please post your email here and their response so we can all compare notes, if you do choose to email these assholes.

      I hear tell that  urlLink Howard Dean  will not drop out of the race for the Democratic nomination -- at least not just yet -- because  urlLink John Kerry  allegedly fucked one of his interns, as  urlLink The Drudge Report  so politely informs us.  (See  urlLink this   urlLink Slate  article for some humor about his bullshit.)  Dean has only marginally more of a shot of being the next President of the United States as my favorite gnome,  urlLink Dennis Kucinich .  Why this last-minute (or after-the-fact, as it were, considering that he has  no  chance, not  little  chance, of getting the Democratic nomination) attempt to come out on top from Howie?  Doesn't he see that the  urlLink bullshit  he is spewing forth now will only hurt his own party's top candidate in the election?    It's obvious to everyone that Kerry will get the nomination.  Even if, as Little Denny K. maintains, no one gets his 50% of the votes and the primary goes all the way to the convention, Kerry will be in even  better  shape.  The convention is in Boston this year, and those fine Massachusetts folks still love their John Kerry as the war hero who had prostate surgery last year and who will perform much-needed surgery on our nation, including bringing our boys back home.  For his part, Dean needs to take one for the team.  And that means rolling his sleeves down, putting his jacket back on, growing up, getting behind the Democratic party's leading man and -- above all -- shutting the fuck up.  Or if he hates Kerry so much, he can go join the dark side and get behind Bush.  So what are  we  to do?  Go to  urlLink this  link and ask Buddha.

      We're not alone (finally) in our distaste for Dubya. An ABC- Washington Post  poll found that if the election were held today, a majority would vote for Kerry. Huzzah! Perhaps the end is in sight.  I was thinking that Florida's large Hispanic population--which tends to be Catholic, who tend to vote conservative--might contribute to its unlikely Republican bent.

      "I've asked my family to put a bullet in my head when I get old.....at 36" (Trey Parker). I wouldn't go so far as to say that about my life span, but he's got a somewhat-valid-if-a-little-screwy point. There's more than one piece of legislation that I wouldn't mind passing about old people, but they all involve me having little to no tolerance for people who can't drive.   There's a number of people in the FL regions that I know who all have valid and intelligent opinions about the way they would like the country's leaders to operate, but I don't think that half (a generous estimate) vote.  Then again, almost of all the people in the military don't vote either (good because most of them are sheep being led to the slaughter) so it wouldn't be a proven good thing if everyone voted, but it might change things.  I played with the "dubya" doll here in work, and only a few of the people saw the same level of amusement that I did.  The best quote there is the one about being shamed twice...classic "W".

      I think that while you have those diverse, urban areas there are also quite a number of retirees in FL. and if you look at the stats the elderly are the most active voting population in the US.  Coincidently they also happen vote more conservatively than the younger generations.    I would personally like to see the elderly population rise up and bound and gag Jeb this year since the dumbass that he helped get into office completely screwed us with the medicaid deal, the No Child Left Behind Act, and the attempted ban on D&E's, not to mention the trillion dollar deficit and shitty economy.  So all those who didn't vote in the 2000 election (and you know who you are) need to get off your poop holes and vote this year!

      I like the idea of Kerry, he's a prior military guy (which I think is good for both character and general knowledge of how the military works), and I think that I can jive with most of the things that he has said.  I don't know the specifics of what he stands for as far as policies, though I can generally agree with most of what he says.  It's the opinion of some of the people here (the more free thinkers) that he's going to be the next prez.  Unfortunately for the democrats, "W"  might be able to spin another victory in FL (my voting state) thanks to his little brother.  I don't understand how FL is considered truly republican though.  There's Miami, with a lot of different people in general (and gays).  More than a few huge universities, where the students should be democrats (if/when they vote).  Then there's also Tampa a few other reasonably large cities with large gay/minority populations.  That all would add up, in my opinion, to having half...if not the majority of Florida being not predominently republican.

      There is a commentator up in Albany for NPR who was in WWII and he was most poignant in his summary of the experience of war: once you have served you are changed.  Some people become "anti-war" as the republicans like to put it and others are as gung-ho for confrontation as ever,  and still others fall into the defeated category which I think you see a lot from Vietnam War, because there was so much controversy over it.  But nevertheless you cannot come out of serving in a confrontation without being changed.     On a different note, I was in a budget hearing today, part of which concerned proposed cuts for welfare recipients, and there were protesters.  It really drove home the gap between the legislators and the public and how their decisions are so far removed from the reality of the situation.

      'ello all! First-time blogger, long-time Bush foe. I voted against him in 2000 and am ready to do it again--in fact, I'm sending my Illinois voter registration today so I can vote in the Dem. primary. Just had to get off my chest how pissed I am over a Washington Post story that Dubya is planning to support a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Whether or not you agree with gay marriage (which I heartily do, marriage for everyone!), how can we countenance the idea of having a constitutional amendment for the purpose of excluding a group of people from a particular right?  The framers didn't even have the audacity to mention slavery in the Constitution (although they didn't do anything to abolish it, either--that would have to wait until 1865.  Which led William Lloyd Garrison to call the Constitution something on the order of "a pact with the devil and a covenant with hell." That's not the exact quote, but I think it's pretty close.  Looks like we're getting ready to do it again). Everybody get out and vote!

      I hate to be living over here sometimes, really has an impact on the amount of news and current political events that I can absorb.   I gotta agree wit my brutha Pragmatik tho, dat "W" can't speak. Seriously, he can't honestly can and IQ level more than the average, um, drunk garbage man?  The sad thing is that a lot of the people who are in the military like him because they don't remember who started giving us raises (Clinton) after another republican (B Sr) took the yearly raises away....so they think that he's the coolest thing since sliced bread because we now get a raise that's equivalent to inflation every year.   But I digress.

      Let me preface this by saying that I think Bush is one of the stupidest people I have ever heard speak publicly more than once.  He is a step backward in the evolutionary process.  I mean it.  A few more of him, and we'll all be crawling back to some primordial ooze, or at least limping back to our caves.  But what about some of his critics?  Look at  urlLink this  article on  urlLink Slate .  This guy actually likens Bush to Plato, and he calls Aristotle (who believed that plants really have souls) the father of modern science!  Aside from that, his article is totally a piece of shit.  Can I do better?  Hell yes.  Make a list of quotations from our fearless leader.  Any reader will be struck by the affront to his or her sense of reason (see  urlLink William James ' "The Sentiment of Rationality") that she or he will realize what a moron and terrible leader the President is.  Come on, people.  This idiot makes it so easy to show what an idiot he is that any idiot should have no trouble doing it.  How can one screw up showing how inconsistent and stupid the President is?!  For fuck sake, give me a job at Slate.

      hello fellow bloggers.  I hope everyone is having a smashing week.  Ridg, sorry to here that you are fighting the maelstrom that our President has helped to create.  There might be jobs in Albany though.  (But if I were you I would stay in Baltimore, it has a much more temperate climate).    Currently I am learning more about public policy and state government that I ever wanted to know.  I am also working on a survey to find out more about human trafficking victims, which consequently, seems to be a really hot topic right now (there was an episode about it on Law and Order last week).    By the way, did any of you see the interview Tim Russert did with Pres. Bush?  What did you guys think?

      Well, I think I know everybody, but I thought I'd introduce myself.  I'm Ridg, and since I guess we all know each other through John, I lived across the hall from him in college, and took Philosophy classes with him, Brian, and Joe, who have yet to surface here.  You out there, guys?  Don't think I had classes with Laura, but I forgive her, and she's great anyway. Katie, Chris, what's up.  Hope you're keeping yourselves well.  So I've been real busy until recently, working at a place I no longer work as of last week, and after that, working towards working at a new place.  Yes, Ridg is looking for a job.  Has anyone else noticed that the economy sucks?  Not that there aren't tons of jobs out there... I just don't want to clean toilets for minimum wage.  Anyone know any congressmen hiring?  I don't think the Federal Government has been affected by the recession yet- or if it is, we're pretending deficit spending don't change a thing.  Wish my credit cards worked that way..  Don't know what's up with the Moleskine obsession recently, John.  They're notebooks, for chrissakes!  Of course, they are really cool notebooks, and I've been meaning to go out and buy one..  Are you sure you don't get a commission, by the way?  Should I mention your name when I get one?

      I just found a nice new site called  urlLink The Moleskinerie , which is a site devoted to and developed by folks who are devoted to the legendary notebook. It is clear to me that there is a connection between Moleskines and Blogs, but I have not been able to discern what it is exactly. At any rate, the founder/creator of Moleskinerie has promised to mail me some buttons that help spread the word about his site. Very nice of this person, I know. First they give me a nice site, then buttons to remind me of it. Sounds almost too good to be true, huh? Well done.   The site even has a  urlLink contest  running, a contest which has been extended to March 15th, rather than February 15th. Here is the page. Your heroic Pragmatik will, or course, be submitting an entry. You should, too.   And speaking of interesting websites, the most worthy candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination -- Dennis Kucinich -- has a nifty site (see the Links section on this page). There are flyers, stickers, and pass-it-on tickets to download and print out. He was on "The Late Late Show" last week, and he is a very viable candidate for leader of the free world. Too bad he hasn't a chance in hell of winning the nomination. We could all smoke weed with free healthcare, and then we could hang out with our buddies back from the war on the way to our living-wage jobs. Considering his chances of winning (or lack thereof), I am very glad that I am in graduate school. I'll always be broke, and I will not be going off to fight Mr. Bush's war.  And I can always get high, if the mood strikes.

      They really do, i just had to put a helpless dog into the dark bowels of an animal control van.  Some asshole had tied his dog to an abandoned building on my street and it was out there barking/wimpering.  I heard it when I came home from class and when I went to investigate, one of my neighbors told me that it had been out there for about an hour and someone had already called the police.    so I went over and talked to the dog, he was scared and confused and was so happy to have some attention and love.  When the policeman arrived he told me to tie the dog back up and leave him there until animal control came.  I told him I would rather take him into my apartment since it was raining and cold outside.  The dog had finally started to settle down and not freak out when I would stand up when the animal control man arrived.  And then I was the one who put the dog in the tiny cage, in the dark.  I am seriously thinking about adopting him.    And if the asshole comes back who tied him up in the first place, boy is he going to be sorry he met me on a dark, rainy night...  On a lighter note, Chris your vacation sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I'm glad you finally were able to get to Rome.  I do wish that I had been able to travel through Italy while I was in Europe, but I suppose i can always use that as an excuse to go back.

      Stress is always a part of the leaving of one's house.   This weekend I went to Rome.  Beautiful city on a beautiful day with lots of beautiful people (and some who weren't really pleasing to the eye as well). 8 hours from the most popular sight seeing place in the world and this was my first time there (how is that possible).  Did not see the Sistine Chapel, but wanted to.  There was a line to the Vatican Museum about half a mile long, and I had driven all night to get to Rome, so the decision was made not to see that particular thing this time.  St Peter's square and cathedral are made to a scale that's not like anything I've seen in Italy before this trip.  The ancient Romans liked things on the lagre-to-ginormeous (i made that word) scale of life.  It's funny stepping out of the metro station talking to Maria and then BAM!, there's the Collesium (sp?).  You just walk out in mid-conversation and there it is!  It's big and breath-taking and something that everyone needs to see.  Rome is just as beautiful as Florence, which I had previously thought was the most beautiful city in the world.  They're different cities to be had though, and not really comparable.   Romans drive really fast, and coming from me that's a significant statement.

      Totally lost on me this weekend.  I had a quiet weekend planned of making a list of the things that I own so the movers don't "lose" anything in transit.  I was mistaken thinking that because I had to work this morning, it wouldn't burned my weekend.  Thanks to the anti-"W" activists here in Sicily, the gates to the base are closed until further notice.  Apparently there's a protest of sorts here today and we can't leave the base because there could be an "International Incident" if we quarrel with them on the way out.  The last time there was a "protest", of the 4000 expected, about 150 showed and all they did was paint peace signs on the road and write "Fuck Americans" on the street in spray paint (they never spelled it right either).  I don't understand why people do this.  We have little to no bearing on the things going on in Iraq (the local Sicilians have a fraction of a percentage of our activity there too it should be noted) other than shipping people over there to relieve the ones who have been serving there for the past year and a bit.  When the whole MJ thing was going on about his supposed molesting of kiddies, I saw a "parade" of 6 people with t-shirts and a banner (or a close representation of one) walking up the street saying that he was innocent.  I like Sicilians (most of the time) but they don't have the right method of thinking to be totally politically active.  To be honsest,  most of the Italians here aren't interested in things that go on outside of the country or on TV and frequently talk about things in the past or the really big events in the recent past.  I think that they're a little to "unmotivated" to put it kindly, to take an active in terest in the rest of the world.  THis has both good and bad points, but so does everything...

      You know, I'd much rather have a president who was both a war hero and an anti-war activist.  I find it interesting that Kerry was a recipient of the Bronze Star, the Silver Star (the two highest awards under the Medal of Valor in the Navy and Marine Corps.), as well as THREE Purple Hearts (which are awarded after being wounded in combat.

      I guess it's because I live in a totally different part of the world, but the weather's good here.  I think it's getting into the high 60's in the day but with the sun, it's hard to gauge (sun's real intense here).   We never got snow, and get rain from time to time.  The fun thing about living on an active volcano is that the weather's never really all that predictable.

      Okay, so it has been snowing in Albany for 24 hours straight.  There was a brief respite from 11:00-12 and since then just more snow (we have a total of 10 inches but who knows how much more we will get).  I know that technically it is still winter, but come on, the first day of spring is on Sunday.  I am ready for the end.  (Unless I can take the day off work and go skiing).  I hope no one else is being plagued by snow, and things are starting to become green and spring like.

      Hey, all.  Here's a link to a brief NY Times article about a possible  urlLink planet  in our solar system past Pluto (if Pluto is really a planet).  Maybe this is where the Bush family really comes from and they are trying to get back to their theiving, murderous race by pushing through nuclear propulsion again at NASA for the first time in 50 years.  That's why he wants to increase the deficit by spending billions more on outerspace when we have starving people and uneducated children in the streets!  Dubya is just trying to bring his evil hordes to complete the domination of the Earth!  By the way, there's another planet in the solar system.  -Josh

      what does "woot mean?  I've seen it on chatrooms and playing cribbage on yahoo but I guess I'm "Hip to be square" HAPPY BIRTHDAY Laura! I think that we're pretty much the same age.  It's a good age and I think that I don't want to advance from here.  On second thought, when the teenagers and young adults become this age, I DO NOT want to be included in that group. Anyway.

(For those who haven't posted in a while, I think we should hunt you down and tickle torture you with feathers!)    I have been so busy this past weekend and week.  My brother came up to visit me this past weekend, and my mother is coming this weekend~for my birthday!! Andrew and I were supposed to go skiing but the damn weather did not cooperate! it was 52 and sunny for most of the week before so there was not snow left.  But we had a blast anyway, there was a motorcycle show at the Albany Institute of History and Art.  That was hardcore, we saw the new Harley V-rod, that sucker is sick.  I would love to get a motorcycle.  I was surprised that they didn't have more Triumph's though, only one.    Enjoy the sunshine and spring like weather!!

      I won't be a jerk here, but  urlLink I will on my other blog .    On Mr. Gibson's movie: I would like to see it, if only to see what it's all about .  My "Phenomenology of Love" professor is Jewish and very skeptical about the film, but he wants to see it, too.  He's right; there's no point in attempting to discuss it intellligently without seeing it first.  There  has  to be more to it than the clips I have seen on the news in this part of the country.  That being said, I am wary of it even as a Christian message.  From my 12 years of  Catholic  school and 2 years or graduate school at a  Catholic  University, I remember that Jesus is supposed to have done a lot more than being executed like a criminal.  What is the message that the makers of the the film, the pastors of churches here in the Heartland who gave "un-believers" free tickets (without screening the movie first, mind you) and the folks who beg us all to see it mean to express?  That Jesus was great because he died and that Christianity is founded on violence and persecution?  There has to be a better message.  Maybe there is.  Maybe I should see it.  Not wanting to is Okay, but not if you want to talk about it intelligently.  So someone call me on it if I talk about it too much without seeing it, Okay?

      ...for all of his hard work getting the word out about the blog. He is a truly dedicated blogmaster.  Spoke to my professor the other day who wants our class to go see the Mel Gibson movie (our class explores a series of debates among historians, and later in the semester we will be discussing issues around Jesus' life and death). She seemed to think my not wanting to give Mel Gibson my precious $5.50 was a good enough reason not to see it. Anyway, even though she couldn't really force me to see it (hooray for being a grown-up!), I thought it was cool that she understood.  Got my Illinois voter card yesterday, just in time for the primary on the 16th (not that it matters much now). I'm sure my jury duty summons will be coming soon...

      So i was listening to the news on the way in this morning, and there was something about the dollar's exchange rate going up 1.5 cents! That's a pretty big hike because of everything that is taken into consideration.  We lose points like that all the time (which I think is directly related to "W" making public addresses), but this is awesome.  Too bad I went and already changed the bill money already or I would have saved like 50 bucks.  Now the thing to watch is whether or not it will stay like this or even, dare I say, increase???

      I love calvin and hobbes, thanks for the link.  It is by far my most favorite comic strip, followed closely by foxtrot.  We named our new cat Hobbes (but he acts more like Calvin)    Oh, I got an email today concerning the welfare reform they are trying to push through this budget year.  They want to count SSI income within total income which would reduce the amount of money that these families are currently eligible for.  SSI is income that goes to the disabled (children or adults) that helps pay for extra services that these persons need.  This means that families in New York, who are currently receiving these funds would have an average decrease of $50.  That is just the average, in the most extreme it could be up to $250.  Basically they are trying to balance the budget of NYS on the backs of those already most vulnerable in the state.  However, they have a 75 million dollar rainy day fund that the governor refuses to touch.  How fucked up is that.    Oh politicians really make me angry sometimes...

      First off, sorry if I spelled the legend of ice skating wrong.  Shooting from the hip on that one. Unfortunately, I am not as well schooled or read as the rest of you, but that only means that I have nothing to quote (no offense meant by that). Religion... My father's a "born again" Christian.  Unfortunately he's in the group of Jesus freaks that believe that you need to push prayer and belief on the your family and "Save your Soul!" I don't necessarily think that religion is for the weak or the meak; it just helps to ease their minds I guess.  What I mean is that there can be a lot of questioning about "Why?" for the human race.  There are a few things about the way that the body works that are a little startling and could possibly need a higher explanation to assist the masses in understanding.  My opinion is that whatever you believe in, don't push it on others for them to believe...that includes those that don't believe in anything pushing that logic on the believers (hypocritical maybe?). Gay marriage...Well I have a number of people in my family, and a few in my immediate family, who are not of the heterosexual persuasion.  I have a pretty reasonably way of looking at the world, and I think that if any two people want to be together, then let them.  One way or another it's going to be that way.  There's a certain individual that I have in my relations that looks at people of the same sex and frequently says, "I'm so married," when in fact they aren't.  This person and their partner wear rings and promised each other that they would be true to one another, just like wedding vows.  One may ask why all these gays (or people in general) want to be married.  Two people can do almost anything without being married i.e., joint accounts, life insurance policies, legal needs (with the assistance of a "Power of Attorney").  So what's the big deal about getting married?  The reason that I am getting married (whenever we do it) is that she's not a citizen and can't legally live with me unless we get married.  We're also a little spiritual and would like the union to be reconized for those reasons.

      Do you think that people who volunteer for such entities as the peace corp, ameri corp etc do so in order for altruistic gain on their part, or is that balanced by the "good" they are able to accomplish.  I was discussing this with a co-worker today and he mentioned Rwanda and how before the genocide that occurred peace corps. workers had built bridges, created cleaner water sources, etc.  yet in the course of the next ten years it was all destroyed.    Furthermore do you think that this (building up and breaking down of "civilization" by US standards) perpetuates a certain mentality, we are better than them because we try to help them out of the hole they have dug but instead they put themselves right back in it.  I guess a feeling of superiority on our part.    L

      Hi all,   I know I haven't posted in a while, but I wanted to let you all know that I was in Washington D.C. on Sunday for the March for Women's Lives.  It was incredible.  There were so many women and men there of all different ages, different religious backgrounds, different sexual orientations and we all came together to get our message across.  Abortion doesn't hurt the fertility rate, what it does hurt is women's lives.    The amount of erosion that women have experienced in their ability to choose in the arena of reproductive rights since the advent of this administration is mind boggling.  Not just women in the US, but women all over the world.  One of the first things that Bush signed after being sworn in, as a matter of fact is was on the anniversary of the landmark case Roe v. WAde, was the stipulation that no funds for family planning would be dispersed if programs taught comprehensive sex-education or if they gave information on and/or performed abortions.    Now we have the partial birth abortion ban, which in fact can affect the ability for a woman in her early second trimester to receive an abortion, as well as the Unborn victims of violence act.  URGGG.  This man makes me crazy.    The fact the women are not perceived to be able to make rational choices concerning their own bodies and their own futures harkens back to the days when women were institutionalized and given shock therapy when they weren't fitting into the norm of how women were supposed to act.  Or when women were still chattel of their father's and then their husbands.  When are women going to be given the right and respect to make and believe in themselves and their own decisions.    By no means am I saying that a woman's decision to have an abortion should exclude men, I think that depending on the circumstances a partner should be included in the decision making process, but ultimately it is that woman's decision.  Not the government's, not the catholic church's, not the evangelical christian's but a woman's choice.  In addition, this recent legislation is not only going to affect women, but men as well.   Okay, this is me climbing back down off my soap box, but not before I admonish you all to vote in the upcoming election in November as well as all local elections since it all starts close to home.  L.

      Anyone who knows me knows that I am no fan at all of pornography (except as a joke, to put nasty things on my friend's computer as his wallpaper, in college).  Porn demeans the fat slob who consumes it as much as anyone else, and who takes advantage of who in the process is a moot point.  One party is reduced to an object; the other is reduced to an animal.  Talk of which is worse is pointless.  But Mr. Ashcroft is going too far.  Read  urlLink this .  You know, I have nothing to say to a man who won't drink coffee or soda or tea.  Nothing.

      Hi guys, sorry I haven't posted in a while.  It's getting to be that crazy time of year.  I thought this was an interesting story about the potential for disenfranchisement in 2004, even though HAVA was passed in 2001 or 2002.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- US heading for another election fiasco as reforms fail By Andrew Gumbel in Los Angeles  in The Independent 22 April 2004  The United States may be on the way to another Florida-style presidential election fiasco this year because legislation passed to fix the system has either failed to address the problems or has broken down because of missed deadlines and unmet funding targets.  Such is the conclusion of a damning new report by the US Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan government body which previously looked into the Florida mess and found alarming evidence of voter disenfranchisement among poor and minority groups, incorrectly compiled voter rolls and other glaring irregularities. "Many of the problems that the commission previously cautioned should be corrected yet prevail ... Unless the government acts now, many of those previously disenfranchised stand to be excluded again," the report said.  The commission's criticisms focused on the failure to implement President George Bush's Help America Vote Act (Hava), passed in October 2002, which promised $4bn (£2.3bn) to help states overhaul antiquated voting machinery - notably the notorious punchcard devices that caused so much trouble in Florida - and sought to set up a nationwide system of provisional voting for people who believe they have a right to vote but find themselves omitted from the official list.  It said that out of 22 key deadlines that have come and gone since the act's passage, only five have been met. Most seriously, an oversight committee designed to advise states on streamlining their voting procedures and implementing the act's provisions was not appointed until last December, 11 months behind schedule. Most states are unlikely to make reforms before the presidential election on 2 November.  In addition, the Bush White House has consistently proposed less money than promised by the act, so states that have passed their own reform legislation have found themselves crucially short of money for implementation.  On signing the act 18 months ago, Mr Bush said: "When problems arise in the administration of elections we have a responsibility to fix them. Every registered voter deserves to have confidence that the system is fair and elections are honest, that every vote is recorded, and that the rules are consistently applied."  Almost half of the states have requested exemptions from updating their voting equipment, and 41 out of 50 have requested extensions until 2006 to consolidate voter registration lists at state level so they can more easily be checked for accuracy. "It will be difficult if not impossible for states to build the necessary election infrastructure by November," it concluded.  The commission report can only heighten the anxieties of an electorate already alarmed by a growing controversy over touchscreen voting machines being introduced - with Hava money - in many parts of the South and West. The machines make meaningful recounts impossible and rely on software developed by companies with strong ties to President Bush and his Republican Party. California is expected to decide this week whether to decertify its touchscreen machines.  The debate over the health of America's electoral procedures is turning into a partisan fight, with Republicans dismissing the concerns as Democratic politicking unworthy of serious examination. When the Commission on Civil Rights convened an expert panel in Washington this month to discuss its report, the Republican Party delegation walked out before the proceedings began, one panel participant, Rebecca Mercuri, a Harvard University voting machinery expert, said.  In Florida during the 2000 election, thousands of eligible, predominantly black, voters were erroneously identified as former felons and purged from the voter rolls by a private company hired by Katherine Harris, who acted as the state's top electoral official and also as co-chair of George Bush's state campaign committee.

      Since we happen to be in the Christian season of Lent, I thought that I would expand my horizons and explore passover in a new way.    This past monday I went to my first Seder.  The Seder is the Jewish celebration of passover, and way of remembering their times of slavery in Egypt.  It was incredibly interesting and included lots of good food.    The Seder consists of four courses and during the first course is the rememberance of their times in slavery and the bitterness that this caused but at the same time, they do not believe that those who enslaved them should be punished for they were god's children as well.  Not only was the food delicious but served as representative of certain aspects of the past as well, the parsely dipped in salt water is a bitter herb to remind them of the bitterness of their slavery, the horseradish (homemade in this case) represents the buring in the desert while they wandered for 40 days and nights, etc.    The food was amazing, Deb's mother had made most of the dishes from scratch, the haror and maror (apples and walnuts, and horseradish) and we had a sort of liver pate, and matzo ball soup, and Gifiltefish, then we had brisket, asparagus, potato Kugel, and finally dessert and through out the whole seder, lots of wine and matzah.    It was wonderful to be invited to experience such an important celebration of the Jewish religion as well as be accepted so readily into a family tradition.

      After recently speaking with Johnny G. the other day about "this here blog thingy" we've come to the conclusion that we don't know who comes and sure as hell don't post (dawg). I left my camera in Rome.  It's somewhere and someone else has a nice digital with a big ass card in it (and about 53 pics of Rome).  So I'm shopping for another.  I had considered getting one of those Digital SLR jobbies (like a nice 35mm real camera) but I realized that I am moving back to the states where we don't exactly ooze with cool picture opportunities (sp?).  So I think that a "point and shoot" is in the immediate future for me.   Yes I am coming home, going to be driving from VA to FL in a week and a day, much pleased about that.  So a good friend of my future father-in-law is here visiting from america.  He speaks old Sicilian and it's funny to watch a straight up american retiree speak such an old language.  We got to talking about the "war in Irack" and I was much pleased to hear that he feels the same as me (even if he's like 40 years older).  Seems that the only people who like "W" work for him.   I sold the Maserati the other day, it will be missed, can I get a moment of silence?  I guess that's about it.  I was just filling time before I went to the gym so my lunch could settle.

      Bush is nowhere to be found.  Dickie C. thinks he is at Camp David -- in my native Maryland -- playing  Halo  on his X-Box.  Georgie B. says he is not coming back to the White House -- ever.  He saw a clown outside of the Oval Office, and this clown's name was Doint Chokona Pretzel.  He told Little Georgie that he would stuff pretzels down his throat if he didn't drop out of the presidential race and concede to Johnny K.  Now, Georgie B. is terrified of clowns, so he did as he was told to do.  He's hiding in Camp David, and he's calling for troops to take out the clown.  We think that Georgie B. is playing  Halo  to practice for a war with the clown.    In other news, little Denny K. is missing as well.  He was last seen on the Amtrak Acela from Philly to Washington wearing a scary clown costume and toting with him a huge sack of Utz pretzels.  No one who is so little can each  that  much.  Once again, President Bush has left the presidency, and we are one step closer to peace on Earth.

      After hearing about the recent accident and the following incidents...I'm sorry.  There's more to it than that though.  Why do people fail to pay attention while driving?  Why does the majority of the people out there believe that they are invincible in those 2 ton behemoths?  Another one that I don't understand is the "mine is bigger then yours" attitude in this country.  I've been around and haven't seen this way of thinking many other places.  I can understand the "mine is faster" way of thought, but with the gas prices going up and the mass of these land yachts only going up...wouldn't the general public have a little common sense and get something a little more responsible in the worldy scheme of things?  Nevermind about all that, because "we're america" and "we're the superpower".  Right.

      I don't like the way that this blog site is set up now.  I thought it was good before and I guess someone went a little overboard with the tweaking.  I've not been posting here and that's bad.  I haven't exactly been cleaning the house either and I'm wondering which is worse (cleaning isn't a high priority, but thankfully i have nothing here so it's not a big deal).  I bought a new car, as J knows. An 04 Mustang GT.  Pretty nice but I think that there was a time when I considered it a "mullet mobile".  Times change and I don't consider myself a hipocrite.   I hate working with people who aren't of the .00005% of the top that I am in (sorry J and L because you might not be either).  Seriously though.   These people can't even understand the simplest concepts sometimes and they enjoy dumb ass morning shows.  "I don't like to listen to the news because it's a person's opinion" was said to me today and I was thinking, "If you aren't there for first hand events, then it's all based on opinion."  Oh well, can't please all the people all the time I guess.   Time to go iron, and John I am still thinking of something to write about to guest blog for you in the other one.  Throw me a frickin bone, and hook a brutha up with a suggestion.  Buona Notte Tutti

      I'm sure that J and L know that I'm in the states now, but if there's any other readers, you now know as well. I have now furniture at this time, it's still on the slow boat from Europe.  So I'm sitting in the extra bedroom of my new apartment and waiting for my long-ago purchased French Press to finish brewing the java. I'm just starting to get over the culture shock of coming back to america (brb coffee's done)....because after being so accustomed to existing in Sicily, it's not the easiest thing to leave "home" to come "home"...strange as that may sound. I like the conveniences though, DSL, satellite, and adequately insulated houses.  At the same time there's a lot of charisma in living where you aren't catered to hand and foot by media or 24-hour ease of living.  I like it here but there's a large part of my heart that strains for the good things in life that don't come with technology.  Good example would be that american "cappuccino" sucks.  Just five minutes from my previous abode, there was a place like a coffee shop (bar in italy) where they make the best expresso, cappuccino, and a bunch of other little foodstuffs that I can dream about even now.  Ahhhh, french press coffee.   Of course there's something to be said about being able to talk to everyone in the street or the shops if you need to.  I will say this, americans can't drive for shit.  When first going to Italy I thought they couldn't drive, but that was only because I didn't understand the common "unwritten" laws of the road.  They are superb drivers, no wonder why we stick to 4 left turns and call that racing.  But I digress...or do I.   It's difficult to fully compare the two societies because they're totally different as far as value structure and lifestyle.  You can say that one country has some things and the other has other things, but it doesn't allow for a accurate comparison of the two.   I cut myself with a butterknife this morning (laugh now but wait til you see them).   Arreviderci

      Does anyone want to talk me out of voting for Tony Blair in November?   I think I'm running a fever. You know, nothing has gone right this week. My brother and I were laughing about it all being a result of Murphy's Law until it got really annoying.  Anyways, I smoked a really nice cigar the other day, a King Cameroon, and had a really tranquil, very bittersweet moment with my boyfriend in which we realized we have six weeks left before I start law school and time will change as we know it forever.  On the lighter side: I was flipping through Runner's World Magazine yesterday and came across a write-up about a race held here in Massachusetts every spring called the James Joyce 10K. As you run, various actors stand at the side of the road performing scenes from Joyce's works. The very last presentation on the course: The Dead.   Not sure of where this concept for a race came from, but I'm thinking of running it next year. Let me know if you know of any literature-happy runners who may be also interested.   I'll try to post some pictures this weekend.

      So I just watched about 45 minutes of a movie called "Flirting with Disaster" and it's a funky flick.  I like laying in the grass and watching the trees move.  you can feel the oneness of a lot of elements like that.  Contact with the ground, with the air, and the moving of nature.  Ever just sit and watch a worker ant doing his little routine?  THey're pretty cool.  Sometimes you can try to dissuade them from their little trek carrying something, but he'll always get back on track and deliver the goods.  Like they have little GPS units built into them. I don't really believe in killing much of anything for the spit of killing.  Mosquitos don't count.  Spiders serve a good purpose (not the brown bad deadly ones), and most other things do too.  Random acts of violence towards defenseless creatures has to be bad in the long run "Chi", or "karma" of the person doing the killing. (put those in quotation marks because I don't know enough about either to make a definitive statement about them). Night y'all

      I've been recently dealing with the seperation from Maria.  Soemthing that I'm also having to get used to (not voluntarily) is the US.   There's an inherent slepiness and tranquility to the area of southern Italy.  They don't have large SUV's (focus killers), DSL (pretty nuch dial-up only), and there isn't a lot of fast food. Good coffee and food, great wine, and a superb atmosphere.  The laid back life is a hard pill for many of the transplanted americans that I worked with.  We are used to having immediate support to everything, where over there..."Domani, forse dopodomani" (tomorrow or the day after tomorrow) is the way of things.   Patience is the key there, and it worked it's way into my mind (formerly not at all patient).  Names like Vincenzo, Maria, Roberto, and Valleria are popular and from generations of family naming (a child is named ofter one of the grandparents always). They may not be the most technically inclined people, but as a whole...they are some of the most beautiful all around people I have had the pleasure of knowing.

      I, too, know the joy of finding non-leather essential items. Though it is a rare thing here in Carver. I will admit, though, that I still have one purse that is leather, and several pairs of shoes.   With all of the advancements we have made in vegetarian foods, why is that non-leather items are so slow to follow?  Somewhat related: I was talking to a chemist friend of mine today who is reading up on early pioneers in his field and found nearly an entire book devoted to chemists who were found dead at their work benches for sniffing and/or tasting things they weren't supposed to sniff and/or taste. It got me wondering when chemists began doubting themselves so much that they decided to bring animals into the mix. I mean really, where is the self-confidence there?  And I have successfully cut fish from my diet yet again last week, after about five months of weakness. Swim on, little tunas.

So happy that I, per Chris' recommendation, bought  urlLink Ronin  on DVD today.  So happy that I had Chinese take-out for the second day in a row and that I had  urlLink Panera Bread  coffee twice today.  So happy that we bought lots of fresh goodies from the farmers' market in Carbondale today and some more at the orchard down the street from the homestead.  So happy that I talked to both of my brothers today on the phone.  Too many reasons to be happy to keep typing, really.

      That's my tribute to southpark. I think that Matt and Trey's collective slapstick comedy and "toilet humor" are right up my alley.  I would like to welcome Jenna back to the land of the caffeine induced writing peoples (Pragmatik and K  I don't know how to post pictures here on the Blog but I think that John does, because he's done so already.  There's a program called "Hello" that is like an instant messenger for pics...and that has a lot to do with it.  Today I feel almost like a normal individual (opposed to the people who live around here).  I started the day trying to meet a friend from work on the water to go fishing...but that fell through.  I then spent about 45 minutes driving all around this shitty little town looking for a coffee shop that wasn't starbucks (which we only have like 1 of here).  There's one but it's not opened until 5 in the evening.  I think that I will head over there on the way out this evening.   Came home and made extremely strong French Press coffee, black tho because I don't have any creamer or milk products (actually Silk soy milk in this house), and read for a little while.  I've been talking to people in the Navy for a little while now, and when I went to Ill to visit John and Frankie last week, it was like watching both a sunrise and a sunset at the same time.  The beauty of intelligent conversation is something we take for granted when we normally deal with people of normal levels of intelligence.    Having not really made a point this morning...I think it's time to have another cup of coffee and see if I can hallucinate a little bit from the overload.  Maybe later a cup of Earl Grey??? who knows (Earl Grey is the favorite tea of Capt Jean Luke Picard from star trek as well as my favorite...how much of a geek am I for knowing that???)

      For anyone reading these, Hi.  I had a superbly-awesommuous time in Southern Illinois for the weekend.  The things to see there are something that I recommend to anyone who is into the outdoors thing.  Giant City is frickin souper cool. I must say that the picture on the previous post from Pragmatik is radical...to say the least.  Not too long after that picture was taken, we saw an overturned van that may or maynot have been filled with people.  Being both overqualifyied for assistance, I now feel a pang of regret for not having stopped and looked into helping.    I'm finally teaching today, but the subject is sufficiently boring to put me to sleep, and I'm standing in the front.  I have a Panera Bread sandwich waiting for me for lunch so I will be going now.    Oh yeah, I rule to the fifth power.

      Holy sheeshie, Totally needed that weekend to happen.  The driving wasn't the funnest experience, but the thought time in the car was beneficial.  Had the greatest time in southern Ill.   Beautiful area, to say the least.  Still don't have any pics of the trip...hint, hint. Really long day in the seat of the old (not really) GT.  That car has a beautiful sounding exhaust...gonna get better too. Thought about Maria a ton, really a ton.  Some of the people that I work with, they don't really understand a close friend relationship, maybe it's the machismo from  being in the military and all, but who knows..."Chi lo sa?"

      I really don't know if I'm capable of writing anything other than what I already finished.   I had a lot of pent up energy, mental and physical...a lot of that's gone now.   I don't know if I could write a short story, maybe something about 4X longer than the one about pseudo suicide.  I'm kind of dismissive lately, too much stress from too many areas.  I want to write something about the letter "K" like you challenged me too long ago.  I was considering something more into the lines of a parntal loss, for some reason I've been thinking a lot about the effects of that event...thankfully it hasn't happened yet and I don't know what writing about it will do.

      Chris, I suspect you had been reading  Nausea , no?  I knew you'd dig that book, man.  Well, I like what you've been writing a lot.

Poe action figure  at  urlLink Mud and Metal  during the  urlLink Hon Fest .  No shit.

      I usually write things that I would consider normal for the blog.  I haven't been happy lately so the feelings came through.  It's not like I'm actually thinking about death or doing away with myself, just that the writing sort of took that direction.  I wasn't writing to try to impress anyone, but I would appreciate feedback.  In general, the people who are reading this are educated, with lots of writing experience.  I, on the other hand, am not.  Those were my first times writing in a while, but I think that they were fairly good.

      The emptiness abounds. The feeling of nothingness is overwhelmingly close, like the heat in coming off the water just before the storm really hits. "What did I do?" you ask yourself.  "Is there anything that I could have done better?"  The answer is everything and nothing in the same.  To be without should be normal for people.  We start alone with a bigger person taking care of us...keeping us alive despite what nature wants.  Then we change pace...looking and searching for our adult (what a term to throw around) lives, meandering about for the person that should be there to make us happy, to make us "complete" a man once said. As the time goes away and the years take their leisurely stroll through eternity, the person that we looked so hard for, after all the searching, is gone.  No amount of science can measure the energy that we put into the mourning, or the all of the time that we spent together.   Truthfully we can only hope to be the first one dead, to be without the pain and sense of absence that we will inevitably feel.

      As the cinched belt fell off of my left bicep, and the needle withdrew it self in it's own good time, I thought.   The concotion that "_" made this time was swinging into overdrive now and it didn't really matter what I did, because memories are not a burden.  Gettin slowly off the ground and looking around it took a minute to focus and recall where I was.  Without the effects I would be forced to recall who I was, and that wouldn't be good for me in my recent state, at least for the past few days.  "Today day is a good day to have fun", I thought.  The sky was a new thing to me, half was vibrant from the day, but it progressed into blackness in the distance.  Between was a mixture of colors that could be called beautiful, but in the right state of thought, also sickening. Deciding that wandering wsa a good idea, I set off.   Thinking about all the things that I am drives me to this ingestion, so it may be better not to think for now.  Letting my legs push me along i come to a small dirt road.  Probably something that some old local farmer has to legally move his large, dinosaur drinking equipment around without burdening traffic.  Change of course. Down the dirt road I go for some time.  I come across some small hand tools for raising whatever crops this man has, I decide that the small, hand-held sickle will be my companion. She likes to ride along with me now, held in place with the pressure of my upper arm pushing on my chest.  I walk along with my arms folded, as if cold. I start to hear sounds of children playing, or what my mnd precieves as children.   I follow the god-awful sounds until I see a small clearing, which opens to a larger clearing where there is a small shanty-looking house.  "They will not suffer", a voice from the inside of my head says.  "Who the hell was that?", I say aloud...disturbing the small ones.  THey look at me with wide eyes, unburdened with fear that should be there.  I take the tip of the sickle, "M" we will call her, and make a like from the bend in my elbow to the middle of the back of my hand.  THe little children are disturbed by this and run, screaming. The opening of my flesh brings to me an unexplainable euphoria.  The "concoction" has a new, stronger effect due to the adrenaline that I provide to my blood. I make thin, spidery lines from my mid-calf to my groin area, as if they are pointing at something that isn't interesting to anyone.  Why is it there? The adrenaline-"concoction" mixture is losing strength, sue to the blood loss.  "I made a mess", I say aloud to noone in particular.  Unable to stay on my feet anymore, I fall to the ground and look at the disgusting sky.  See how the purple fades into black, fading.  Your color is blue now.

At least for the TWO primary writers.   I've been thinking about writing a dark "piece" dealing with my inability to accept the deaths of close family members.  Not that I've had any pass, at least in the past 4 years or so.  Maybe a loose poem or something to express. Still mentallly planning the "K" piece as well.....Stick around for the excitement (or excrement if that's your opinion after reading)

      Baby Joe helped me sand off some of the excess touch-up paint and apply more to smooth it.  We have to sand that later, give it another coat, and then use the clear-coat touch-up.  So, the Mazda has to stay in Dad's garage for yet another night.  And we can't drive it.  Boy, do I owe him a truck-wash -- which will be funny to watch, since I can't even reach the top of that thing.

      My name is Hans, this is Frans, and ve're here to pump you up.  The gym  I regularly go to the gym, so kill me if I like to look in shape, it's because I'm way past being a little egotistical. I HATE going to the gym on the base though.  All these people who think that they are the coolest thing since sliced bread walking around with ILS (imaginary Lat symdrome) with their arms like 6 inches away from their torsos and their chests poked out. Holy run-on sentence batman! There are generally two kinds of people who go to the gym: 1>The dumb ass people who date dumb ass other people and try to hurt themselves everyday and make a spectacle.  Those are usually the ones with ILS, and here are commonly young marines whose heads can fit in a jar. 2>The smart/thoughtful people to watch their food intake, workout correctly, and actually research what works which muscles (excercise wise).  These people are found inthe other gyms not populated by military kiddies, work out in their own little worlds and usually have (dare I say it) a BRAIN!!! I would class myself in the later of the two categories and think that I am a fairly intelligent person.  I hate to use this blog as a vehicle of bitching like a musclehead, which I am NOT, but it's true and not unlike a small excerpt of the reality that we all deal with (if anyone is reading other than John) everyday.  Thank you, I will bow out now.

      Chris, no way is a Mustang a cock-extension.  It's not about size, but about style.  I love your car, man.  And the term phallus-adjustment...you need to copyright that.  That's the funniest thing I've heard in a long time.  Our car has a three-inch in diameter series of chips on the side panel extensions (stupid sporty plastic).  I have no idea how that happened.  It looks like an animal was trying to get into the car -- maybe that raccoon I almost killed last week.  I am working on it with touch-up paint, sand paper (very very fine) and clear-coat touch-up.  I'm very glad that Baby Joe knows what he is doing.  In other news, John T. Yingling, Assistant Scoutmaster of Troop 151 since 1990, is finally getting recognized tonight.  He's being awarded the Hopkins District Award of Merit, the best award given at the District (not Council) level.  I wrote one of his letters of recommendation.  I still call him Uncle John.

      James Brown is the best morning pick-me-up music that I can find so far.  There was a time when I was rocking out to bands like Prodigy or Tool in the morning, but James and the funk are energizing. Back from the cig now This is a totally different change of pace for me, being back in the states, working environment, home life.  It's like I got transplanted into someone else's life and now I have to figure it out ounly using my personality, more than just a little challenging at times.  Oh, and not having a lot of friends isn't a great time either.  But I digress. The cock extension movement is alive and well here in Pensacola, Big ass 4X4's and corvettes all around.  I didn't want to include my car in the list, but I'm sure that others purchase Mustangs (especially the snakes) for phallic adjustment help, such as was pointed out by a friend yesterday.

      Jesus built my hotrod, or so once a man said who wrote the songs for Ministry, which brings the former Mrs to mind (she rhymes with punt).   DUDE, I LOVE WHAT YOU DID WITH THE BLOG!!!!  It's so pretty, maybe I will write the ode to the letter K or L like you asked me so long ago and I just blew you off.    How's the point doing?  Will actively post more I promise, this blog will not die, maybe we should move it though and post pictures.    Is it just me or is "the Noose" one of the beautiful recorded songs ever?

      That's how I feel recently.   I also read Angels and Demons and found it less entertaining to read than the other one.&nbsp; He recently released another book, which I own and can't remember the name....Updates as I read through.&nbsp; Pragmatik's book recommendations are interesting, for lack of a better term.&nbsp; I have enjoyed each of the books that he told me were good, but they're all difficult reads.&nbsp; Maybe this is because I don't have that GC, BC, SIU education under my proverbial belt, as he does.  I get into the "who to vote for" conversation all the time...and it's hard at work because a lot of the military members are elephants (that is the republican thing right?)&nbsp; My stand right now is that it's a vote for the lesser of two evils.&nbsp; First we have the man who can't really speak that well, although I was told that "speaking ability isn't an accurate way to measure one's intelligence.&nbsp; Look at Hitler, he had a stutter."&nbsp; And then we have the man who tells the anti-war, yet troop supporters things that we want to hear, and I can believe that most of them are true.&nbsp; Kerry's unproven in office, but to me that's better than the proven sketchy truth W we already know and love.

      First of all, I AM FREE!  I have FINALLY gotten my own computer internet-friendly and am happy to report that I am no longer dependant on others to get online! This means more posts, and lots of pictures!  And Laura's back and that, also, makes me very happy.  News from the greater Boston area: Law school starts in three weeks. Joy. The Falmouth Road Race (cheer for me - I'm number F1771) is two weeks away and my knee is finally on the mend. Not a moment too soon. I had this entire week off from work and LOVED every minute of it at the beach. The man and I broke up last week and are trying really really really hard to be just friends. And on a semi-related topic, I think I have commitment issues. (Anyone familiar with the Matchbox 20 line "Everybody's trustin' in their heart like their heart don't lie?") And I've started listening to country. That must be semi-related, too.  I, too, just read "Angels and Demons" and found it a fun read. Not quite as interesting as "The DaVinci Code," but still a lot of fun and very suspenseful. I'm looking for my next book... any suggestions? Fiction, preferably.  Campaign news: I think I mentioned this before, but I have officially decided to use the write-in candidate option. I've had a lot of people ask me how I could throw away my vote like that, but, the way I see it, I'm taking it very seriously. I don't want to vote half-heartedly, or for a candidate that I THINK I'm best supporting. I want to be able to say proudly "I voted for so-and-so." A vote for anyone else is throwing it away.  So whom should I vote for? Who the heck would make the best president of the United States?   Other news: ALL vegetarians are sexy.  &nbsp;

      I really, really love the song "Schism" from Tool.  It's the truth put into a poem, made into a beautiful balad.  I don't normally like associating "balad" with bands I like, because I think of the big hair balads.  Tool has a few though and they're moving, to say the least.  I know that some of the few people who post on this blog, and the readers, already know the words to it, but I am posting it here.  I hope this isn't a "copyright" violation.  Schism:  I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing. Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.  I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over. To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication  The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, And the circling is worth it. Finding beauty in the dissonance.  There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away. Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.  Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any Sense of compassion Between supposed lovers/brothers    And when you put those words to the music, it's beautiful...as I said before.  Just a little of the sensitive side of me

      What's wrong with "stupid" action movies?  Why can't an action movie be good for the (gasp)  action n?  There will never be another  Matrix .  The two sequels proved that.    Get off of your intellectual high-horses, critics, I say.  The second and third  Matrix  movies had some of the greatest special effects in movie history.  Sure, they lacked some of the "philosophical underpinnings" of the parent film, but so what?  Was the title of either movie, " The Matrix Academic: Get Your Philosophy Here "?  No.  There is a great place to get one's philosophy, if issues of human freedom and moral agency are one's cup of tea.  They're called philosophy books.  Sure, some films get philosophical.  That's fine.  That's a very good thing, I think.  But why fault an action movie for not being a banquet of state-of-the-art special effects, as well as philosophically rigorous pieces?  What was Neo supposed to do?  Seriously contribute to the store the Western philosophical debate on free will and fate?  Was Morpheus expected to give an oral defense for his dissertation on control?  Anyway, there was no more "philosophy" in the first than the sequels anyway, to be honest.  Look closer.  This brings me to  urlLink  King Arthur  .  Several critics (I don't feel like coding the links, really, sue me) don't like it because it's just an action movie.    So the hell what?  Does one go to a summer blockbuster to learn about history, to hear debates on philosophical issues or to be entertained?  Calling the movie unentertaining is a good criticism of a movie.  But getting all over an action movie for not being historically accurate or philosophically rigorous is like faulting a philosophy book for being...dry.    For pete's sake, if you want philosophy, read Sartre.  If you want to be entertained, go to the movies.  If you want both, don't expect big-budget action movies to all be like  The Matrix .    Seriously, though, the worst part about  urlLink  King Arthur   was the lack of banjos and unicycles.  There.

      This week: I spoke to a friend of mine the other day for a little over an hour.  He's a strong anti-Kerry guy and he was spelling out the evils of John Kerry to me.   I was listening, but only half way.  I'd like to make my own opinion, and I appreciate that he went out of his way to call me (in a good way...not like a telemarketer) and see what my political opinions are. I read, back-to-back, an article that he sent me, then Pragmatik's thing here about the controversial movie.  I haven't seen it, and if I did, I wouldn't have much of a leg to stand on because I'm half knowledgable about the events covered in it.  But that's the shitty thing about living out of the country during a world changing event...you are a little less informed because of accessibility to the media.   The car sounds good now John, real good.  It's faster and louder than it was when you rode in it, and it only took some money and about 10 hours of time.   Maria and I are on the "in's" now I believe and that's good because I really think...well, that it's good.    And I am SOOOO looking forward to hearing what Maynard and the guys in Tool put out this time.  I'm happy that they're still making music after all this time.  Hopefully they don't take the route Metallica went and make shit for after they hit their prime.  I think that they have the internal control to just say, "Let's not ake any more because the music would be compromised." if they eer came into that position.

      this is a clipping of sorts from the tool website: "Work is underway on Tool's next album, despite the fact that A Perfect Circle will be touring for the next little while. The writing process for this album will be similar to the process for "Lateralus": the band works on music, sends demos to Maynard, he works on vocals, and so on. The singer discusses this in the newest issue of Kerrang magazine, saying "we're working on a new Tool record now. I'm multi-tasking. I can't walk and chew gum but I can change hats." It was four and a half years between "Ænima" and "Lateralus", it has so far been (only) almost three since the spirally record was released. So really, they are almost ahead of schedule"   I'm rather happy about this.  Especially if the mood (some of it) from the APC sequel is carried into the new album from Maynard

      You know what?  I'm too lazy to condense my post about  Fahrenheit 9/11  from  urlLink my other blog .  So I'm going to paste it here.  Sorry it's so long.  I saw  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11   today.  I was not in the mood to watch it, since I had one of those headaches you get from sleeping too late, and I really wanted to go outside today.  However, we were going to get (and indeed did get) violent storms today, and my wife really wanted to see it.  So to the flick I went.  You know, a lot of people are calling this film a piece of propaganda.  I think that's inaccurate.  I think that what critics mean to say is that Michael Moore is a liar (which I don't really believe), and they don't know the proper meaning of the word propaganda.  Propaganda, in their eyes, involves deliberate deception, whether that is in the form of outright lying, spinning or omitting the truth or what have you.  There is a fine line between presenting the truth in a biased manner (what propaganda essentially is) and their idea of propaganda, and I don't think that Michael Moore crossed that line more than any news outlet which only shows us half of the truth and such anyway.  If  Fahrenheit 9/11  is propaganda, so is the damned "Today Show."  There is nothing terribly wrong with propaganda always, and one might say that anyone who puts forth his or her views cannot help putting a slant on them.  Then we're all guilty of propaganda, aren't we?  Maybe I'm wrong or crazy.  Or, god forbid, biased.  Besides, I don't think critics are giving Moore enough credit for his fairness.  When he showed something that the American media censored, he rarely called attention to it.  He never mentioned Tony Blair by name, and Prime Minister Blair was only in the background of shots twice.  He never actually says anything negative about Bush or anyone else, for that matter.  He lets them embarrass themselves.  He states facts about the actions of the Bush administration without really judging them at the same time outloud.  He doesn't have to.  If one is worried about unfairness, and one has not seen this film, one should shut up promptly and not criticize it.   I think it is the most emotionally trying documentary in the history of film-making.  And it has little to do with Michael Moore's orchestration, i.e., music, voice-overs, etc.  It is upsetting because of what happened.  The charred bodies of American soldiers being dragged through the streets and hung on posts are what is disturbing, not Michael Moore's film-making.  The people weeping in theaters are not weeping because of Michael Moore.  Men younger than I am are dying and many more are suffering.  When the gloss of the big media goes away, we see that what is going on is terrible and grossly unnecessary.  Indeed, the sickest thing about this is that it is entirely unjustified.  Even if Moore's suspicions are true, and this is all about money and power, neither of those hollow things are worth human lives and human pain.    The ever-wise Max Scheler says that sacrifice is the act of giving up something for a higher value (since he thinks values are phenomenologically given, prior to all cognition, as higher or lower than other values).    Sacrifice is a word used a lot in  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I think Michael Moore is on the right track, but he didn't come out and say it: our troops are dying  for nothing .  They are not  sacrificing  their lives for anything, since what they are dying for -- money, power, or utter foolishness -- is unquestionably lower than their own immeasurable value as human persons.  Each and every one of the noble people over there are worth more than all of the Bush family's and Saudi Arabia's money --  each  person alone.  Throwing away life for anything that serves life (which money and power do) goes against all human reason and feeling and goodness and enters the realm of evil.    Am I saying that the Bush administration is evil?  Yes, I am.  Lying that causes death is evil, especially when the consequences of such lying are clearly foreseeable.  The war machine has thrown away American and Iraqi lives for nothing that is a higher value than those lives.  It's backwards.  And we are all fools if we sit back and let this keep happening.  Just because the thought that innocent people are dying for nothing is a terrible thought to stomach doesn't make it untrue.  If that were my brother, I would have a hard time dealing with the idea that he didn't sacrifice himself for a greater good but that some businessmen-turned-politicians threw his life away and didn't even give him a choice in the matter.  That is without question.  But no amount of pain can make something untrue or make something go away, as if it never happened.  But action  can .  I didn't vote in the last election.  I was a senior in college and was studying some peace studies, and I didn't want to take part in the government, for my own stupid reasons.  Luckily, Maryland always votes Democratically in the Presidential elections.  This year, I thought about sending in my absentee ballot to Maryland.  Who wants jury duty, right?  But I'm going to vote in Illinois anyway.  I hear that Illinois can go either way in Presidential elections, and I need to do my part for my country by getting rid of Bush.  The biggest reason I want to vote here, though, is for the pleasure I will get when I leave my polling place having voted against that bastard.   Michael Moore is certainly doing his part to enlighten people.  My brother who is in the United States military (and I am, and will always be, proud of him) was a Bush supporter.  Hell, when he told me last weekend that he was going to see  Fahrenheit 9/11 , I thought he was joking with me, since no one in my family really agrees with me on most political matters.  However, I spoke with him for a long time yesterday, and he told me that he did really see it.  And he is  not  voting for Bush now.    Way to go, Michael!

      The way that the military puts it, at least the ones who are lower ranking and "ignorant" (for lack of a better term)...is that because we get pay raises each year, the prez is a good person. I've had this conversation with John a few times, and other's who are like minded about "W", and his ill decisions.  In the military (not really defending, just explaining the positions of the ignorant ones), we live a fairly sheltered life, and there's not a whole lot of social interraction with other people.  We work with other military types, eat, and do a lot of shopping with them as well.  The children have their lives, but with no real impact on the parents or the military member as a parent.  They don't see "real work issues", I guess would be a good way to call it.  Not much of them watch the news, other than the local at 5 or 6 with dinner.  And they really are easily led, so when there's a strong republican in the midst, the rest just agree and follow along.  They also tend to believe the random ranting and raving of someone who has no real clue about what they're talking about (politically) and again, they follow along like sheep to the slaughter.   I heard the other day that it takes 8 support people to be there for one actual fighter, in the US military.  When looking at the situation from the inside, it's not that unbelievable.  I don't think that "W" has done much of what he said, nor do I think that the american people should vote for him.  THere will undoubtably be people who DO vote for him in Nov this year, and hopefully the deciding state isn't Florida, or any place that the Bush family has reign over.   I'm off the soap box now.

      My father, the 36-year veteran of the United States military and my brother, new to the service, are both Bush-supporters.  (Other than that, they are both great men.)  It is common knowledge that the majority of military personnel and families support Bush.  This baffles  the shit  out of me, considering what a lack of RESPECT Bush has for the members of the military.  He's calling them up again, just because he can.  It is a stupid, but little-known, feature of American law that the President can -- during war or a national crisis -- call up any and everyone who EVER served in the military, up to and including retirees under the age of 60.    This includes my father, who will be 55 years old one month from tomorrow.    Sure, I could console myself with the idea that Bush would never do that, right?  Whatever.  I doubt that most of the people who voted for him (and that's not most of us, now, is it?) in 2000  ever  thought that he would fail to find the criminal who attacked our country and would then try to cover it up by attacking the man whom his Daddy couldn't take care of in the early 90s.  He's surprised (read, SHOCKED) us all before, and it stands to reason that he would do it again.*    Bush is a liar.  And he has been screwing over the military of our nation for years now, because he can.  Because he believes they will vote for him no matter what, since the military "always" votes Republican, right?  To quote retired Air Force Chief of Staff General Merrill "Tony" McPeak, a Kerry adviser, "The troops are paying the price for arrogant mismanagement and poor planning at the civilian policy level" ( urlLink via the Boston Globe ).  Rather than screwing over young civies, like myself, Bush puts the pain and burden of this war on the members of the armed services and their families.  He already has their votes, and that's all he needs from them these days, it seems.  What would seem  more just  than to send someone like my father, who served his country for three and half  decades  to war, would be to send someone like  me .  I hate this war.  When we went to the rescue of Kuwait, I was all for it.  But not this obscenity.  Nonetheless, I would gladly go, if that meant that my father could stay home.  I know, that's easy to say when: a)A draft is very unlikely; and, b)I am married, a graduate student and almost 25; I would not likely be drafted anyway.  I know.    Exactly how much does Bush expect our servicemen and servicewomen to give?  When does the time come for the rest of us to give a little, too?  My father saw god-knows-what in the jungles of Vietnam.  He has had to gear up his friends and send them to wars and conflicts many times.  He's seen more horrible things than anyone should ever have to see.  What's enough?  Send people like me -- ME INCLUDED -- instead.  And instead of younger folks who have done their service to their country.  But above all, I wish we could send Bush.  Let him be far from his home and family and watch his friends bleed to death in the street and risk being shot or captured and beheaded everyday.  He deserves far worse.   *[Luckily, however, Bush won't be President much longer.  My father's retirement is safe.]

      I can't run  at all .  I'm embarrassingly out of shape, and I have still not healed entirely from smoking -- even though I just passed my 2-year quitting-forever-anniversary last month.    I can, however, sprint for about thirty seconds and outrun half of the people I know.  But then I fall over coughing and wishing I had never picked up smoking in the 90s.  I'm not what you would call a distance runner.:)

      I used to think that running was the most torturous activity in the world.  Then I started seriously getting into my training...now I think of it as somewhat torture.  Once you get into good enough shape (and stay there), it's a pleasant way to excercise.  But DON'T let yourself get out of shape or you will pay the price.  Being down in here it's not possible to find a pleasant time of day to run, short of about 2 or 3 in the morning.  I like that idea for a run, with the theme and scenes...but I've no experience with tht writer so I would just be on a run.  Good distance, should be about 48 minutes.    That is all.

      Oooo... I like the red rocket very much!  I haven't meant to to be MIA lately. Just been wrapped up in one thing or another. The boyfriend and I are back together (Yeah, THAT breakup didn't last long!). Law school starts next week (Eeek! What was I thinking?). Ran the Falmouth Road Race Sunday along with 9,000 other people - finished in the top third of the women. Met Gabe Kapler today and remembered what it is like to be twelve years old and standing in front of a really, really cute guy that you have a really, really big crush on.  Boston survived the DNC. Surprisingly well, too, I might add. Nothing of any real political importance to report from these parts.  Except that the Amber Alert here kicks major rumpus. We're two for two in the last two weeks - three for three overall!  Also, we've just passed a law that allows level three sex offenders' names, addresses, workplaces, and level of compliance to be posted online. I'm not sure how many other states are doing this (I SHOULD know), but I think it's a very good thing. And, of course, the site had thousands of hits after being up only hours.  The only other bit of personal news that I have is that last Friday I met my boyfriend's eleven year-old son for the first time. Please bear with me, here. I'm still sorting through my thoughts about this. Of course, I've been very excited about meeting him for a long time now, but was in no way prepared for the power of the moment and how much of a reaction I would have once we were standing face to face and I was reaching out to shake his eleven year-old hand. I can't even put it into words yet.  I guess part of it, first of all, was the reality hitting me that I am in love with someone who has an eleven year-old child. Part of it was witnessing for the first time the fatherly pride in his eyes when he looked at him.  Part of it was watching the two of them interact, and walk side-by-side (like mirror images of each other) and being amazed at how natural they look together and how I could have never seen this before. And a huge part of it was being in absolute awe that this was HIM - the boy I had heard so much about.  I've known every play he's made in baseball for the last two years. I know what grades he got, what warnings were sent home. I know about the stitches he got when he fell off his bike trying to keep up with his father. I know his favorite lines from "Austin Powers." I know about how he tries to hide the fact that he stays on the phone late at night with his girlfriend.  I know how he struggles with being a hunter like his dad and uncles and grandfather, and being an animal lover.  He is the most important person in my boyfriend's life. And I was in awe of him.  At one point, my boyfriend and I caught eachother's eyes and there was a split moment of absolute happiness. For someone with commitment issues,  I certainly surprised myself.  (And, of course, I'm scared to death at the thought of meeting him again.)  So that's my happenings as of late. I may have some Baltimore pictures I can post. I will have to check.

      Can you take and post some pics of baltimore. noticed that you put up a thing on your other blog about taking pics there. my requests. Lake Roland, Fells Pt, the little park near your house where we used to take the dogs, BMA, and a front shot of the Daily Grind.  Apparently W was indeed here today, maybe the weather situation was evidence of how things are going/could go. Who knows. I forunately got to speak Italian about a week ago. Seems to be that there are some Sicilians here, the husband is in flight school I believe. They were walking by the other day when I was bs'ing with my roomate, I was sitting on my motorcycle. He said something in italian about how I had a nice moto, and as they were walking away I sort of shouted to them if they were italian. They turned and we had a nice little talk about driving here, food, and motorcycles, all in Italian (so proud of my broken language ability). It was a nice rememberance to a beautiful place...sadly I am pained everytime I think about being there because of Maria.  I think that we are going to get hit fairly hard this week and weekend with the two storms that are approaching. I am not looking forward to it because I am planning to go to tampa this weekend to get some parts off the other car to sell. I also wouldn't mind riding the $10K toy i just purchased.

      I'm glad our fearless "leader" is not coming to my town.  That must be a terrible feeling.  C, I'm headed to Baltimore tomorrow.  Wanna get away from W?  Meet me there, man.  It's less than a day at 100 mph from Florida.

      It's a pretty big deal.  Tomorrow the prez will be in sunny pensacola for a day of mass murder.  They're claiming it to be a day of meet and greet, with a schmooze session in the civic center (the biggest public venue in the area) with the prospective voters.  There are a lot of people here who are going to it, both in and outside of work...not me though.  I bought a motorcycle a few weeks ago.  It's fast, but I respect it.  I can also do a wheelie at and above 100 miles per hour, well actually the bike is capable of this because I'm too much of a chickenshit to try.  Have a happy day
