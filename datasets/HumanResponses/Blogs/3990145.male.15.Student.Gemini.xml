        Today is my school's annual Narfa test... I am aiming for gold but its really hard man... I got a C for my shutter run with 10.4 seconds... Actually this is really slow... But nevermind, cause by getting all C and above I can get a Gold!~ But it isn't very "smooth" for my other stations... I got 40 for sit and reach, for this one I am not sure what grade I got... I got A for my sit-ups and chin-up, 43 and 13 respectively. But I actually failed my standing board jump!! I only manage to get 190 cm~!! But that teacher was some what "cockeye". He rounded everyone's actual readings by 10 to 20 cm!!... Nevermind... I can do a re-test doing my next PE lesson...        &nbsp;    Arrrr.. Its going to be the 2.4 km run on Thursday... That's really scarly... For the pass 2 years, I have been getting timings like 13:35 minutes. But in order to get C, I think a 12:10 is needed... Aw man... This is going to be hard for me... But nevermind!! I will just try my best!! Among all my tests, seriously I think chin up is the most easy to score A... Wahahahaha~~! Ok its time to sleep~ there is still school tomorrow~!!!     &nbsp;

        Today my friends(You Lun, Alvin, Kam Chuen and Ser Chin) and I went to watched i. Robot. The show was not bad actually... Yea I think I enjoyed it. The show is about a guy call "Spooner" ,Will Smith, who hated robots because he asked a robot to save a girl in the past, but the robot saved him instead of that girl... Then the person who create the robot got thrown out of a window and landed on... Not very sure about the level... Hahahaha. Then bascially the story is about how that Spooner guy save the world from all those robots because the main computer controlled all the robots and wanted to take over the world and~ solve the case at the same time... Quite a nice show over all, with some funny parts. The techonoly at that time was really cool, how I wished I live there.. Haha, just without those robots... Haha.   Then after the show, You Lun and Alvin went home. Kam Chuen, Ser Chin and me went to sit at some where in the yishun bus interchange and chat... We talked about some gunbound stuff(hey hey don't get me wrong man I'm not a gunbound insane player... Just playing for fun..) and then it was about 5 p.m. then and Ser Chin went home and Kam Chuen came my house... We play gunbound for a while(actually I found it really gay... Hahaha.. personally~) then Ser Chin and Kenneth joined us.. We won like 10+ rounds in a row but was quite boring that so I went to play Counter-Strike... Erm... Thats about it bah... Then I went to have my dinner and its now~~ oh and Kam Chuen went home at about 10p.m... Tomorrow got basketball game so got to go sleep~~

         Today is Racial Harmony Day. Orchid Park Secondary&nbsp;had a little celebration and we had no lesson that day!! Cool huh?! Haha... We went to school just like an normal day, assemble, then the party begins~! Seriously, I didn't espect so many students to come in their traditional costume... And&nbsp;I didn't wear because I don't have one and don't really have much Malay friends to borrow from... The celebration was some what like a "pam-sum-ma-lum" haha.. We can walk around freely and then we can also buy food and other stuff from the stores. Someone of my friends went to watch the Chinese chess competition. Actually I found it quite boring... Hahaha... We walked around for a while&nbsp;and then finally bought some food and settle down in the canteen to eat them! Yea!!! Wahahahaha... After a while we had to gather in the hall to watch the concert...        The concert was quite nice actually and I think I really enjoyed it. After the concert, my friends and I met up at the canteen and then decide what to do next. Then We(Irwin, Wei Jie, You Lun, Ser Chin, Alvin, Ivan and Me) decide to go play basketball... We went to the basketball court near Khabit MRT station and then the time then was about 3 p.m? After playing some games, Andrew came and then Samatha and Min Yi... The girls didn't really play, they just stood there and watched... When it was about 5p.m, some "Haro Bikers" came. They were from OPSS too... One of them is my counter-strike clan member!! Wahahahaha... Then they jio us play match... Haha I think we(Andrew, Alvin and me) play jian then win... At first they keep scoring but we didn't really remember the score, then someone I suggest 7 balls start "now". Because we had the ball in our hand that time, we kept scoring then win... Wahahahahaha jian right!? But that doesn't mean I am a jian ren lor... Hehe   &nbsp;
