       Anyways its day 2 of the diary thingy. Hope ppl will check back because im bored as hell at home so i have nothing better to do than get introspective and write stuff down. Couple things i wanna cover i guess: First in my profile theres an audio song. To play it right click and open in a new window.. Please be patient it may take 10 seconds or so to load. And my friend sabrina also made one cause we were bored at like one am, so check hers out... www.xanga.com/sabbychanny . of course mines way cooler *_*. Well thats bout it, ttyl ppl.      Hottie of the Day- Jessica Alba(yeaaaaahhhh lu)      P.S Hilary Duff is the uber hottie, so just cause i dont list her doesnt mean thats not implied!!! shes better than all of them but i figured ppl would get sick of seeing the same name over and over again.. YOu know i woulda done it for Hil....yes i am that lame d:-)                                                                                     PMD    yes pink is a fine color
