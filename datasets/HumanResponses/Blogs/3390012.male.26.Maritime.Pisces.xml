      Well, the 9-11 Commission is at it again, and today, Rudy Giuliani was on the menu.  For the most part, the overly critical bunch of hypocrites on the panel were pretty polite to the once hero of the day.  The real story here is the families of the victims of the tragedy.   "My son was murdered because of your incompetence!" shouted Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter son died in the trade center. Seated three rows behind Giuliani, she jabbed her finger at the former mayor and waved a sign that read "Fiction" as he gave the city's emergency response a glowing review.   This woman, obviously saddened by her loss fails to realize that her son, in fact, died because terrorists flew planes into buildings - not because of the Mayor's incompetence.  This woman seems to have forgotten that Giuliani didn't fly any planes into any buildings, and that's the problem with a lot of people in America right now.  Everyone is so hung up in the politicization of this that they have forgotten who the real enemy is.     The report (The commission released two reports that mark the most comprehensive probe to date of New York's response on Sept 11) led to an aggressive interrogation of Giuliani's top fire, police and emergency management officials Tuesday, with Republican appointee John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary under President Reagan, calling the failings "a scandal" and "not worthy of the Boy Scouts."   Lehman told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the comments were misunderstood and that he was not trying to criticize those who led the Sept. 11 effort.   This seems to me to be a pretty cut and dry statement, and I think it's pretty clear who Lehman was talking about here.  If he wasn't trying to criticize those who led the effort, then who was he talking about?  Who was involved in a scandal?  Who's not worthy of the Boy Scouts?  We need to get to the bottom of this!  If it wasn't police, firemen, and local officials he was talking about, then who was it?  I want to know what could possibly be misunderstood from that.    The bottom line here is that this guy, just like the rest of these back-peddling pinheads, is trying to put on a show for the cameras.  They want to point the finger, and use powerful words like "outrage" and "disgrace" without the backbone  to take responsibility for anything themselves.   Later, Giuliani was chastised by members of the public. A longtime city gadfly berated him and the commission, yelling, "Three thousand people murdered does not mean leadership!" He and another person were hustled out of the room.    Others in the audience shouted about the failure of Fire Department radios, shouting, "Talk about the radios!   It's obvious why this guy was hauled out of the room.  What leadership could the mayor have possibly been able to provide in the midst of this disaster that would have prevented the loss of 3000 lives?  Again, a sad case of misguided anger.  He should be upset at the leadership of those who want to destroy our way of life, not those who serve to protect it.  I also have not heard anything to the effect that Giuliani, or anyone on his staff for that matter, built the radios that the fire department uses.  How quickly we forget about the communications nightmares of that day.  The trade towers had gobs of antennas on top of them.   Cell phones up and down the east coast were down, along with local telephones, cable, and yes, radios.  I can't wait for these people to start filing lawsuits against Motorola for wrongful death.  In my opinion, the mayor did a tremendous job managing this disaster, and should be commended.  I wouldn't have traded places with him for anything, and I doubt that anyone else in this country would have either.  Anyone who lived through Sept. 11th has now, essentially, lived in two different worlds.  Hindsight is 20/20, and I don't see what good it's going to do for this commission to sit and look for a scapegoat in our government.  Just like Pearl Harbor, this has changed the way we think, and so we must change the way we act.  Nobody wants another three thousand of our brothers and sisters to die.  We can't lose sight of who is at fault here.  The final report that this commission generates will not save a single life.  The only thing at this point that can save lives is the extermination of these radical Islamic pests, and paperwork and commissions can't do that - our military  can .  I could go on and on about this article, but I am satisfied hitting on the few points in it that upset me the most.
