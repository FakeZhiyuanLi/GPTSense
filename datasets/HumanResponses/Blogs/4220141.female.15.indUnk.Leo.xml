      i had a sleepover yesterday! lacey came and it was simple, yet entertaining. i taught her some stuff on psp and she made a shitload of lecavalier icons, lol. lacey lacey lacey. lacey and her lecavalier. i just think it sucks that vincent lecavalier plays for TAMPA BAY. godddd. he's canadian, play for a canadian team damnit! frvgforjfwe it's not fair... the only reason is because the usa offers a lot more money. >:[  i got a betta fish and i named him andy.  supposedly my friends DID call on my birthday, by the way. my brother just never told me. T______________T he's such an idiot!!! if he had just told me it could've saved some trouble!!!! jesus christ he's annoying...  meh.

      lol, some guys on hotornot want to meet me. i just joined that site for shits and giggles and being the idiot i am, i also joined the meetme thing on there for shits and giggles too. now about 8 guys want to meet me and they're all in their 20s it seems like. haha, maybe i'll start a friendship with one of them but that's it. tha'd be wrong if i started a relationship with one.  they're making a movie out of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy!! i already knew this but i felt like mentioning it because it's so damn exciting. ^_______^ i love the book and i can't wait to see the movie whenever it comes out (which will probably be sometime next year). i just hope they do a good job with the movie. annnnd sam rockwell will be playing my favourite character, zaphod beeblebrox.  i've been experimenting with brushes recently on account of i just downloaded a lot on psp 7 and i just figured out how to use them. ^^; here are some things i've made:  rachel mcadams:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1744504/339596  casey:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1745618/339596  casey again:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1745619/339596  me:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1745860/339596  me again:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1745861/339596  me againnn:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1745867/339596  me once more:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1745868/339596   this was my first attempt with brushes:  urlLink http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1744541/339596 . lol. i love grover!

      wow, i just got a new blog... cool... i have another online blog/journal too, and you can find that one at  urlLink http://slingshot.greatestjournal.com . as you'll notice, everything on there is more polished than it'll probably be here. that's just the environment on gj though.  yesterday (the 12th) was my birthday. i am now 15 years old. i dunno, i don't feel much different and i don't feel a year older. the past year has gone by so quickly! it seems like just yesterday i turned 14, not 15. crazyyyy. but i'm happy to be 15. :]  i didn't do anything for my birthday, because practically none of my friends could show for what i had planned. :\ i only wanted my close friends to come, so only 4 people were originally going to come but 3 of them couldn't. so, what was the point in the other person coming? heh. i guess i'll just postpone it, but whatever. mehhhh. my friends didn't even call. well, supposedly one did but the others didn't. that kind of ticks me off. i mean, seriously... they were home 'n all (just couldn't make it to the thing i had planned because they couldn't show up at the specific times and it was kind of too late to change the times), couldn't they have at least called? particularly because they couldn't show up for my birthday? grrrr. my friends are weird like that sometimes. it's annoying but you get used to it.  buuut i did get very nice birthday signs from my online friends! i   yeah, nothing else to talk about... so i'm out.
