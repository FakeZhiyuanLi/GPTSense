       I know I just posted but I am posting again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish this was like a xanga, where you could play music.&nbsp; I would be playing tiny vessels by DCFC.&nbsp;&nbsp; So just hum it as you read this.   Pat pisses me off, day after day. I know he plays me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know he has a temper.&nbsp; I know he is wrong for me.   WHY CAN'T I GET THAT THROUGH MY HEAD???!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   God damnit. I need him, and I hate that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be with Chris, or Ryan. But I can't seem to detatch myself from Patrick.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the most intimate moments, and it makes me forget all of the things he has done to me.  I need&nbsp;to remember the pain he's caused me, and not allow myself to be reeled back in. &nbsp;I need to be done with him.&nbsp; I need to be with him.&nbsp; I need a change.   The way I am living now isn't satisfying me. At all. I need a guy who is TRUE and HONEST and will love me for who and what I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sick of all this suffering, and&nbsp;can't allow this to go on.    RANDOM WORDS, THE FIRST TO COME TO MIND AT THE MOMENT: deceit, lie,&nbsp;trust, played, unreliable,&nbsp;fucker, jerk,&nbsp;fake, passion, and hate.   wow, that was kinda weird. Don't know whyyyy I did that.   Right now, the thing that is making me&nbsp;most mad, is that he told me he&nbsp;loved me. Then&nbsp;afterwords he told me that he really did mean that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he loved me, would it fade that quickly? If he loved me,&nbsp;would&nbsp;he be able to do this to me?&nbsp;&nbsp; If he loved my, WHY IS HE LETTING ME GO SO SOON?  I just&nbsp;talked to Scott (the awesome dude) about all this, and he said I should let Pat go. I should search for someone who will make me truely happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp;if Patrick returns to me,&nbsp;then&nbsp;so it&nbsp;is meant to be. ANd if he doesn't....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then I am better off with out him.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; think about it. &nbsp;

       Miranda's birthday was yesterday. I didn't get to talk to her. Kristen's birthday is today.&nbsp; I haven't talked to her yet today.  &nbsp;My number of friends is decreasing rapidly.&nbsp;Miranda and&nbsp;Kristen are still&nbsp;my friends still.&nbsp; At least I&nbsp;know Miranda is. I don't think Kristen likes me anymore.  She's got her pom friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not very pom-ish. At all.&nbsp;Maybe in&nbsp;high school I will meet some people.    I hope.   That sucks.&nbsp;I am such a loser.  Maybe if I wasen't so emo people would like me.&nbsp;&nbsp; too fucking bad for them  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       Deanna's journal says that they still kiss. Everytime they depart, they kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I can't believe him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe he would do this to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or her even. He can't be with us both.  He needs to make up his mind.&nbsp; I refuse to be played. I can't belive he thought he could get away with it too. How ignorant could he be?  I need someone to talk to about all this.  Miranda is in Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miranda is the one that I would feel best about talking to.  Laurren is out with her mom. I'm not going to call her mom's cell to talk about this.   Chris.. Chris.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris is a good friend. He in understanding, sweet and never gets angry with me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need ot talk to Chris, before I do something that I will regret. I don't want to cut. Ever again.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But I need it. So bad.   I hope Chris is home.

       I just got back from a walk. It was a long walk. I walked alone.  During this walk, I passed a man.&nbsp;I bet he was about 25. He appeared a mess. He was crying when I passed him.&nbsp; I asked if he was okay, and he said "No one is okay, ever."&nbsp;  Now, where as most people would have quickly walked away, thinking he was insane, I took what he said to heart. I replied to him, "You are right.&nbsp; I know that noone is ever okay."&nbsp; He looked at me with this intense look, and continued walking. i stood there for a while, thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to be in pain forever. Life is slowly killing us all.&nbsp;    No one is ever okay.

       I am getting frustrated with this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to know if I am being lied to, led on, or cheated. By reading Deanna's journal it sure seems that way.&nbsp; I wish he couldn't lie.&nbsp; Ever. If he couldn't I think that everything would be better. Deanna would know the truth about me and him, and I would know the truth about him and Deanna.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't he have any morals?&nbsp;&nbsp; God, I love him even though I am suspicious. He is the greatest kisser ever. He is so sweet, and I love how I feel when I am around him. Like the rest of the world doesn't matter, and will never again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out for now, more later.
