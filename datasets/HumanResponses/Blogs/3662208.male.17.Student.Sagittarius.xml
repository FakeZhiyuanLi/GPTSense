      It's been a while, atleast in comparison to the frequency of posts when I started. Independence day is soon upon us. I think that I'm going to blow a lot of shit up. Although, half of it is spent elsewhere, nevertheless, shit will be blown up for days. I have weekend plans with my Farrah-y-poo. I got to spar tonight, although I'm not sure if spar is the proper term. I only got to block, and what's sad, is that I still managed to hurt people. I got to see Farrah today as well. All in all, a decent week (Atleast so far.)

      Hello kiddies. Welcome to another exicting post by some guy with nothing better to do. Most of this week has been hectic. I've been doing a lot of running around and getting nothing done. But anyway, Farrah was quite vicious to me tonight. She kept being so abusive, good thing I like it though. I barely got to work out tonight, which is probably a good thing as I've yet to get my little condition checked. I found out some nifty news, it's a secret though. I'm quite pleased with it, and hopefully this little tidbit will lead to better stuff later. Well I'm going to shut up now. I'll leave with a quote, as I so like to do. I've been listening to a lot of TOOL again so here ya go "I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this shit, blood, and cum on my hands." (I know disturbing...)

      Farrah and I are doing well. Betty has gave up her relentess bitching. I get to see Farrah this weekend. Hmm...whatever will we do? I've finally gotten skinnyish. I look pretty good now, other than the hair. I should probably get it trimmed. Alas, I have given up my VA trip. Indeed, the lotto and poker would of been a fine trip, aside from it being jellyfish season (I'm sure I would of got stung for money atleast once.) I shall end this post now. My parting wisdom for today kiddies is "Stop touching yourself there, it makes Jesus cry."

      Hi. Today is a good day. Having balls pays off, ya know? I can see Farrah every weekend for as long as I want. Yay! The bitch (her stepmom) caved. HAHAHA! I AM THE KING! But anyway. I seem to attract bad things, but I always live through 'em. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? Well, to wrap this one up. I AM LIKE A VIRUS, I WON'T DIE, I MULTIPLY, or something like that. I think a better closing would be 'Perseverance pays off', so just pay attention to that one. Well bye, bi, buy, and by.

      I've still yet to talk to Farrah. That filthy bastard Betty won't let me. I wish she would work, I could talk to her there. I wanna leave so bad, but I won't until I talk to her. I've been so forlorn as of late. I've been taking so many pills to try to forget. It seems everyone I know's life is shit as of late. I wish when I took a vacation I could go as someone else. I guess there couldn't be highs without lows, so I hope this passes swiftly, or hopefully I can just sleep through it. I hope Farrah doesn't feel the same kind of pain I do right now. I've been listening to a lot of old rock like Green Jelly lately. I've also been listening to You're Not Here by Akira Yamaoka, Suteki da Ne and To Zanarkand off of FFX, and Sound Life off of Trigun in a pretty much continous loop. I've been so down (I know I keep repeating that but it emphasizes the point, ya know.) Well I've got to leave to go to Goju-ryu shortly so I'll wrap this up. To conclude, life will always be shit all you can do is wait for something decent to happen.

       urlLink    Well this is lil ole me.&nbsp; urlLink    I thought I'd add a pic of me to the blog here. I'll probably add some more later. I should probably let you know that this is an old picture. It's a year or two old. I've got longer hair now, but I don't have any recent pictures. I'll try to get some though. Hell, I'll even try to get one with Farrah in it.

      Well I've just woke up from a heavy pill induced slumber. I'm still kind of high from my trilepetal (I don't abuse them, I use them to sleep{prescription buddy}). But anyway, as soon as I talk to Farrah (my girlfriend) one more time, I'm leaving. I'm going to go to Virginia. Maybe staying with my sister for a while will let things blow over. Not too mention I make money off of her sometimes and it will help me pay for my 90$ phone bill from calls to Farrah. Unfortunately, she's long distance. Isn't that fucked? Same area code yet...it's long distance. BULL SHIT I SAY! Apparently my opinion doesn't matter to the phone company. So, I'm out for right now.

      This is my first entry. YAY! Not much to talk about. I've nothing important to say, nothing to really complain about other than finding out that I've actually seen a plan in motion to put ID chips in the homeless. Which is bullshit. I mean who the hell are these people to go around putting chips in people, just because they think it protects the "others." Well, I'm of like a prom dress.
