      I hate paperwork. I think I might be in a minority there, ha ha. I've decided to finish the library books before I get started on the other one. Bit of a pain, but.  Richard's looking at me again. It's hard to know whether he's in love with me or I just have something on my face. I wouldn't know flirting if it stuck its tongue in my ear, but you can't ignore all those glances and little compliments and things. Still, I doubt it because I thought he was with that coffee woman, whatever her name is, something Swedish.  If only it were Alan - I can't count the number of times I've looked at him like that, but no, not a glimmer,  he  couldn't care less, it had to be  Richard , didn't it?  No. Probably not even Richard. Not even bloody Richard.

      I'm feeling a little odd. I may have been over-indulgent in the whisky department. I saw a TV programme earlier... it involved David Icke. All very strange.  I watched Sex and the City too. Even when those girls are having a bad day their lives are great. God. I can't remember the last time I had sex. Well, I  can , actually, it was with David ( not  Icke), but that's not the point. The point is it has been a while. It has been a long time.

      ... there was a little girl called Virginia. A sweet girl, kind, thoughtful. A girl with a real future, beloved by all. And she grew up to be... a neurotic bundle of nerves.  I can hardly complain I suppose. My life is like something out of a Richard Curtis film, except somewhat lacking in the high-speed chases through London on motility scooters and quad bikes, held up by gangs of postmen. And etc.  I went into the cafeteria at lunch today, which reminds me of being at school and sitting huddled in my green plastic chair with a cardboard carton of cold chips in front of me. I always feel so insecure in places like that. Actually I'm feeling insecure in most places at the moment, I think I'm developing agoraphobia or paranoia or something like that, or some kind of fear of other people, whatever that's called. It's mostly those days when I can't be bothered to put my contact lenses in. Even when I wear them I'm still constantly paranoid that I've left a period stain somewhere, like on the back of my trousers or a chair, and I keep checking back to make sure I haven't. I also worry that the toilet hasn't flushed properly and stuff like that. I definitely worry too much. That's why I don't have any nails.  I borrowed some books from the library a few weeks ago, and now I feel like I can't read anything else until I've finished them, in case I forget about them. I'm always forgetting about library books. But I really want to read this book that I bought from Waterstone's the other day. Now I can't get any further with the library book I'm in the middle of. It's like a mental block. I didn't really want to read it in the first place, but Abby recommended it and I promised I would read it. Maybe I'll join a book group as soon as the ones I'm planning to read are out of the way. I really need to relax a little bit.
