						   Today was terrible...spent most of my time till 4pm in bed, lazing around...just couldn't believe I did so bad for my second round of interview yesterday. Did I have too many work till I couldn't identify what I was good in? Or have I really been left out of the government sector for quite some time? Or was I just not good enough for the lady interviewer? I am just too tired to repeat what actually went wrong....with the whole thing :  3pm : Interview...filled up a damn long form with essay questions...till 3.20pm. 3.45pm: Slim lady arrives...(had wanted to shake her hands but she also wanted to take the form...sigh! what a mess) 4pm: Had the interview.... 4.10pm: Sweating with questions (where are you going with your mba, experiences, etc...)  4.25pm: Dugged onto my ex-company's detailed experiences...terrible...feeling...it was like 2 years ago...(What I have learnt? Well, organizational skills, project management skills, customer service skills) 4.35pm: You seemed to have left Civil service (as if you don't like to work there) and so...you sure you want to work here?) (*Yes, cos though the work is pretty much the same but the scope of customers are different and always felt business organisations need a lot of help and voice*) Am I wrong again? Sigh! 4.40pm: Ok. You will hear from us within the next 2 weeks...(*Whao...that's long torturing for me) 5pm: Drank a full cuppa latte at CoffeeClub. Walked around till 7pm 7.30pm: Decided to go home 11pm: *Sob! *Sob! till zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......  Didn't want to wake up though my eyes were already up. Woke up at 4pm...had a big bowl of my favourite lychees and laze back again ....decided to surf the net for my favourite idol since young, yes the dashing aaron kwok. Haven't been listening to his songs since his 8th casette I bought....til uni times...I have stopped but one thing I can really learn from this singer is his spirit to work hard and believe that he can make it. He has the same date of birth as me, so why can't I do it? I just don't believe myself.  I decided to start a little diary like this blog blog thing....hopefully miracles will happen.  I totally have no drive to do anything... Didn't even have my lunch and dinner yesterday....  My little sis is having her chinese oral today...bet she is sleeping now and waiting for her turn. Hope she can really do it. She speaks English more than any other languages..  That special one? Busy with work again I guess....I trust him...but don't know whether I am going in the right direction...really I don't know. I just hope for the best...He said I am just going through a rough patch...and I am strong...but I said I wanna peng san already...really.  I guess I had a few obstacles to go through at this damn age....career, love, family....still wondering when will I ever get through all these...  urlLink

						   Woke up real early today, perhaps couldn't sleep much...slept at 2am yestederday...   Anyway, had a plate of noodles with mum...bet I rarely had lots of such time with parents when I get married next time..yeh?   Didn't do anything about jobs today...nothing really spice me up especially when I know that no one will bother to read especially those recruit pages...   Went to Junction 8, new shop opposite GV. This is similar to the store in Heeren with all the teddies, etc...Well I bet they can really last, so many students just grab the teddy bears and then placed them down.   Bought a few packets of gummies at Mini Toons though. Suddenly felt wanted to be little girl again with all the little cute little stuff toys, etc...I even saw Gummpy, remember the green little plasticine man? Yeh, those were the times ...   Anyway,bought a few packets of veg and fruit (With Wheat grass) marigold juices...  watched the documentary of how powerful wheat grass is to our skin, so better drink more...   ok...Day 2 is going to be over...missed all my ex-colleagues...sigh!   Had a good talk last night with that special one...He really opened me up...to be more responsible....
