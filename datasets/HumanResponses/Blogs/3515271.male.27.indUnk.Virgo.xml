      Dear Father's Wife,  Yesterday was the day that we said our farewells - as a family - to our dear departed one.  To my father, it was his father, and as tough a role-model to lose as any.  For others he was a grandfather, and friend, a husband and lover, and a wonderful person.  Yesterday was difficult for all concerned - and my father has never been one to show his emotions.  Since my birth in 1976 I don't think that I had ever seen him cry, that was until yesterday.  I sawe him weep like a baby at the front of the chapel, sat next to his mother and holding her hand.  You were sat behind him, and gently rubbed his back - gently reassuring him of your presence.  It's nothing of this with which I wish to take issue.  I questioned myself as to your right to be there - but then you have shown up at so many events to which you have not been invited; I think specifically of a competition in London which you both attended, and a concert in Shropshire too which I had not invited you; that I should hardly have been surprised at your presence.  Whether or not you were invited is irrelevant.  You were there, and you behaved the way you did.    It's with this that I wish to take issue.  Upon arriving my mother, my brother and I made a bee-line for my grandmother.  We all love her, and we wished to comfort her on this day, as upon her it would prove hardest.  It was for her that we attended the funeral.  I am a bizarre soul, and since my spell in 1996, I have become more self-reliant.  I am aware that death can bring pain and remorse to all - but I am able to deal with my grief in my own way, and frequently do - so my role was to support my grandmother in her time of grief.  We saw my father and shook his hand and greeted him.  My mother tried to greet you in a friendly manner and shake your hand - you simply asked had my brother and I greeted my father.  My mother had replied you hoped so - since she brought us up it would show a poor reflection on her if purely for the sake of recompense or malice we decided to be rude - your reply was on the offensive.  "It will be the first time they've seen him in 16 years."  Now this point isn't true.  I last saw my father one year after leaving hospital - so I haven't seen him in 6 years, not 16.  My brother has not seen my father since I was in hospital - what was 8 years ago.  If you are going to attack someone, or something to prove a point, can you get your facts straight please?  Upon being reminded that this day was not about you, or us, or my father, you stormed out.  My grandmother was notably upset, and required some comforting before she'd settle back down again.  Apparently you had been told before, and after this event by my father that it would be wrong - and an apology came from him (not you.)  Later in the day, after the funeral, you talked to my brother.  Upon returning to the chapel you asked me "Is it possible for you to do that?" I asked you what you were talking about since I was not present for the conversation.  You replied "Put your arm around your father."  I asked "Why?" because I was confused as to the motive.  I don't know what your agenda is or was - whether you are busily trying to orchestrate a reconciliation between us and my father, or you were trying to get us to comfort him.  A reminder - we were there to support and comfort my grandmother, not my father.  On my question you stormed off again - visibly upset (still don't get that) - and rounded on me saying that you'd be writing to me informing me of my father's death and funeral arrangements.  Were you deliberately trying to be in as poor a taste as possible or was it merely a coincidence.  I stood silently and watched you go.  I don't know what my father has told you - or how you've been misinformed over the last 16 years of my life.  My father left us.  No word, no warning, and not explanation.  He left us.  He was the one who decided to give up visiting us once a month.  He was the one who decided to stop calling us every week.  He was the one who only sent birthday and Christmas cards.  He was the one who failed to invite us to your wedding - or indeed inform us that you were married again.  That pleasure fell to my grandmother at my great-aunts funeral.  He was the one who - when my brother asked for some money to help him out of a very tight financial spot - disowned my brother.  He actually wrote it in a letter "I have no son called Philip."  In short - he should be the one to build the bridges and not us.  Why is it your responsibility all of a sudden to try and reconcile us when so much has gone  on between the families that has been negative.  Why is it you who's felt so aggrieved that you have spited my mother and us with your venom, and held us solely acountable for the bad blood that there is between us and my father?  Why?  Can I suggest a guilty conscience?  Need I remind you that my mother has been tirelessly trying to get me and my brother to contact my father ever since he left?  Need I remind you that it takes two people to let a relationship slide - and I tried all I could to stop that happenening.  My father stopped being my dad several years ago.  I've wasted 10 years on him.  10 years of effort, life, enthusiasm, and work on the man to have none returned.  To have him not try to build a single bridge to us.  I've had enough, I've tried enough, and you've poisoned the waters between us again - for what would seem to be the last time.  At a time when the family is laying down in pain and anguish, you kick it in the stomach.  Thank you for reconfirming my opinions of you from the start; and thank you for not disappointing me in just how small and petty people can be - so as not to let a family occasion of pain, and grief go by without sticking in your poisoned dagger and twisting it.  I welcome a rebuttal - as I love a battle of wits with the unarmed. Yours, only in spite, bile, and narrow eyed contempt and hatred.

      I'm sorry that I've not scribbled in over a week.  It's been tough to synthesise any more emotive a topic than "uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu I'm so tired."  As a consequence I decided to leave my faithful audience with little to read but my insane babble from the last few weeks.  On Tuesday last week (22nd June, 2004) I was telephoned at home by my mum telling me that my grandfather (on my Dad's side) had passed away.  Ever since I've been dealing with it slowly, and trying to organise myself and my brother (lives an hour away) to travel up for the funeral which was held yesterday (29th June, 2004.)  My grandad was 83, and he was a tough old sod.  He'd represented and defended his country in the 2nd World War - being predominantly stationed in Singapore, and was married to my nan in 1942.  He was quite healthy (apart from his constant smoking - which he gave up after his 3rd heart attack) and fairly active, which I attribute as the main cause of him living so long.  My grandma was quite understandably upset, and distraught yesterday - a fact not made easier by certain members of my family.  One of whom has warranted her own post (occuring after this one.)  As a family, they bonded as they do - down the pub with cigarette in hand.  Due to some stress of the day I relented and had my first in nearly a year - but relented no more.  My brother and I stayed out of most of it all - preferring instead the company of my cousins Amanda and Andrew.  Both of whom we intend to stay in touch with - although I know full well that I'm terrible at things like that.  So - in light of all the events of the last week - all I can say to you, my wonderful readers, is that you live as you must, and you do as you see fit.  The only person in life you must please is yourself - as it is also the person you must rely on most.    Seeing my family yesterday, I saw just how important it was for them to have someone there to comfort them.  For me, it is ever a test of my strength, and my own personal comfort with myself and my own feelings.  As their tears fell like rain, mine were shed inside; my face strong and willed; and my manner was one of utmost compasion for those that needed a pillar which to rest against.  For me?  Well, I guess we move on to another day, and another life.  My family will grow forever smaller - and the numbers that I can actually stand smaller still.  In my way I love them all.  Just some I don't like much.  Thank you, my lovelies, and take heart in your life.

      Well, the wonders of school - and big brother - continues.  Since opening my blog I've been inundating the internet with my own brand of verbal nonsensica and whining drivel, which some of my wonderful readers (you know who you are) seem to be semi-in tune with.  Today will be no different.  What is it with Kids?  They always think that they are the hardest done to - and they have never once asked how you're doing, or indeed what you're up to?  Some kids have the brazen nerve to take the piss out of me (and my elongated hair, language, and temprement) but never all that well.  You see, I have a great deal of respect for someone who can outpace me in the comeback stakes - or who can out-think me around a topic; but there's few in this school who can without resorting to hair-pulling and name-calling.  Kids, it would appear, seem to have the attitude that the world owes them something.  And do you know who I blame?  ("         !", I hear the silent majority scream, up in arms)  That's right, society!  Without it - and this country's determination to run the country for the younger generations - kids would not be running roughshod over adults as they do now.  Parents are as equally to blame as the ineffectual pastoral guidance that schools give them.  And not just secondaries, but the primaries as well.  We breed kids into dependent learning styles, and poor target setting arrangements, so their own self-esteem is rock bottom, and their expectations of themselves are low.  Chris Rock put it best when he said "...always want credit for s*** they're supposed to do.  'I ain't never been to jail' What do you want a cookie?  You low expectation havin' m*****f*****."  Kids are the same.  "I did my homework."  You're supposed to you idiot!  "I've got a pen"  What were you going to write with, your finger?  This attitude stems up through their lives and to their children too; so we end up with this epidemic of low-expectation, low self esteem, generations being disaffected in the world and expecting everyone else - the hard working, tax paying, general public to foot the bill.  I'm sick of all of it - and all of them - and most of society.  What ever happened to the axiom "You get what you deserve."  You don't work for it, you don't get it.  On that note, good day to you all (out there in the aethyr) and remember - it's always the quiet ones.

      Would you believe it?  Anything you want you can find on the internet.  Last week it was a Latin Translation of "Cleanse The Fallen with Extreme Prejudice."  The week before it was for a poly-sided dice supplier.  And today - it was for a Welsh Rugby result.  This is the other conflict I have with the various sport showing organisations.  Namely SkySports, ITV, and the BBC.  (All the American readers will now be going, EH???)  Last Sunday ITV suspended the grand prix half way through in preference to watch England get beaten by the French (and not too soon - those English scumbags were about ready to be taken down a peg or two.)  And this weekend, not a single channel on terrestrial TV showed the Welsh Rugby match against the Argentine Pumas.  I'm not one to brag (I am actually) but the England Rugby team has failed to beat New Zealand twice; while Wales lost narrowly to the Pumas, and then beat them last night.  Was it covered in any detail on the news?  NO!  It's the same with most things.  Mind you, when I lived in Wales, I did compain constantly about the English results being shown in Wales.  I don't understand what's going on - and why there is this prejudice that resounds throughout the English media.  It's the same with the commentators - which, I'll give credit where it's due; some have stopped doing it - who praise an athelete for winning by saying "...and it's a great triumph for Great Britain."  and when they lose "...it's a tragic loss for Wales."  No sense.  Which tends to go further too.  Almost everyone in the UK fails to recognise Wales, except for the Welsh, or those that have lived there.  Ask most people where it is and they don't know.  But on the news some government minister will say "This will be great for England and the people of this country."  When the same decision will be imposed on the Welsh with no mention in the news.  All I want is a little bit of recognition for the Principality.  I love that country - and I feel like it's my home; so naturally I am a little over protective.  Cymru am bydd.

      Kids!!!!  I've just had an amazing class.  I don't think a single one of them worked the full lesson, and I don't believe they worked their hardest.  We try to get them to behave, not becuase we're trying to instill some form of reasonable behaviour and responsibility taking (well, we are really) but simply so they understand the appropriateness of their behaviour in a place of work.  They were fun though.  An entire lesson preparing for Work Experience in 2 weeks time, and all they can talk about is how hard they'd hit a complaining customer.  Nice!  It's like my year 8 class yesterday.  They didn't revise.  They hadn't worked.  Most of them hadn't listened when I said there was an exam.  When they got their results back they were upset.  Understandbly so condsidering I've been horrible in asking them to work, be quiet, and concentrate on the lesson.  It's like I've been there before and made the mistakes isn't it.  But I remember being their age once.  And I remember being that pig headed and arrogant.  I remember whiling away lessons talking to my friends, and as such have no recollection of some of my French lessons.  I also remember not doing very well in Technology (my one and only F grade in my life) because I didn't take it seriously enough.  No, kids don't listen.  They never will.  I only hope they learn the lessons they need in life more easily than I did.

                     Is it me - or do people become arrogant wankers when they're  driving?      &nbsp;    I've just got home - give or take ten minutes - and I'm  absolutely livid.&nbsp; Be it the asshole who cannot understand that driving too  slowly constitutes dangerous driving, or the van that tried to go through  me....      &nbsp;    On my way to and from work I have to drive through some  villages - most of which have buses driving along them, so tend to be slow and  stop to get passengers on.&nbsp; A bus happened to stop on the opposite side of  the road to me, and the cars behind it decided to overtake.&nbsp; In this  country, the right of way in that situation is with the lane that is not  blocked.&nbsp; However, 3 cars decided to overtake the stopped bus and make me  stop for them.&nbsp; Not good.      &nbsp;    Then I got stuck behind some idiot in a VW golf who decides  that doing 30mph in a 60mph zone is an acceptable speed with no room to let cars  passed at all.      &nbsp;    Then, as I was turning into my road, came a van.&nbsp; He was  moving to overtake a line of parked cars after I'd already started passed them  too - then decided to try and force me up onto the pavement whilst leaning out  of his window calling me a "dick head."&nbsp; At which point I nearly snapped  and retorted "It's my right of way, you ****"      &nbsp;    Drivers? &nbsp;Can't stand them.&nbsp; It's just people in  general and their lack of courtesy that I hate.&nbsp; Everyone is always too  busy, or in too much of a rush, or their journey is more important.&nbsp; I hate  them all.&nbsp; In fact, the next idiot who decides to do the same thing will  have me sat in the middle of the road with my engine off until they back up, and  screw the road rage.      &nbsp;    Best regards, dear readers, and drive  defensively.

      So - dear readers - nearly a week.  In fact, I was intending to sort out at least one blog a working day (we all need a rest at the weekend) and I've managed to miss the last two days.  Fear not, I'm hoping I'm back with a vengeance.  I do have to wonder at the intelligence of people sometimes.  And in no more a unique way than watching Big Brother 5.  I'm a "half-on-half-off" BB watcher from the first season onwards (I didn't watch 4, it sucked ass!) and have been semi-hooked on the Orwellian nightmare of the house, and the wonderful "goldfish" style of entertainment.  Yes it does make everyone want to be famous and give them a subtle yet unique route into notoriety (none more so than Jade Goody who was told she didn't have to strip after a particular game and did it anyway!)  And so, here we are, some 3 weeks into the programme.  1 person has been chucked out for being a rather crass and opinionated, myopic, lebian political activist - Kitten.  I always find it amusing when the more priviledged classes (her's was a middle class upbringing) rebel against societies restraints and actively buck the system from without.  The role she chose was as an anarchist lesbian trouble maker.  One piece of graffitti she dawbed on the house wall was "No war, except class war!" Does she realise that her family would be some of the first to the gallows, or the bastille?  2 people have been moved into a "bedsit" (studio apartment for the middle classes) to watch the goings on in the house.  Now, both Michelle and Emma are in full grasp of their faculties; yet somehow are devious enough to play a very special game.  Both are bisexual, and openly admit it, and both are fairly promiscuous - from what I have been led to believe.  Upon entering the bedsit Emma decided to read the instructions - when it said "read this aloud" she promptly increased the volume of her voice.  Dolt ?  I think so.  Upon reading out something that Emma didn't understand - Michelle repeated it.  It went something like "If the housemates abide by the rules, they will re-enter the Big Brother house at Big Brother's discretion."  Emma said "What does that mean?"  Michelle replied "It means that if we abide by the rules we'll go back in the house at Big Brother's discretion?"  Dick!  So the fun continues, and I'm sure there will be more posts as it does.  I love people's stupidity and two-facedness.  Another gem; Emma and Michelle still in the bedsit "What are they doing talking behind Nadia's back like that?"  (Nadia being in the bathroom, the other housemates discussing her smoking.)  It's irony on a base level, but I like it.  Be well.

      Sometimes, I just don't understand the stupidity of people.  We have the European Football Cup 2004 starting this weekend.  Thousands of British fans are winging their way to Oporto, Lisbon, and the Algarve as I type.  All of them, to a person, wholly devout to the holiest of all known things - the overpaid, highly sponsored, highly pampered, baby - the professional footballer.  Most professional sports people are just that, professionals.  I've seen them work, and train, and that training pay dividends.  Who could forget the legend Roger Bannister clearing 1 mile in under 4 minutes, the glorious world records set by sprinters, pole-vaulters, horses, javelin throwers, and shot-putters the world over; and who could forget the glorious day in 1999 when Scott Gibbs ran a Welsh try over, and Neil Jenkins slotted over a tough conversion to hammer the English 32-31?  Well, aparantly, most people in this crappy country.  I've said before, I'm a man alone.  A Welshman (by adoption and grandparents) living among the English.  It's a horrid feeling at the Six Nations when I know my bravado and posturing will not pay off, and while I always uphold the honour of my boys in Red, often they have narrowly missed it.  Yet several stupidities I feel I need to point out here.  Some of my pupils - bless them - decided to break into a chorus of "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" in the middle of my lesson.  When questioned as to why they were singing it, they replied "Because England and playing France on Saturday."  Always one to point out the irony, and inaccuracy in others, I indicated to them "France are playing England at  football .  'Swing Low' is a Rugby anthem."  Despite this, the songs continued.  It struck me.  Why would a nation of English be singing a Negro Spiritual from America in the 17th Century?  Is the irony only mine to see, or did anyone else notice?  I further questioned this pupil.  "Do you know the second verse?"  "There's a second verse?" he replied.  Oh how quaint.  Such is the idiocy and myopy of the England fans, they don't realise the song is not a terrace chant.  How do I cope?  Much worse, this isn't solely focussed on pupils in my classes, but to fans all over the country.  I've heard some of them speak, and you wonder how they hold down jobs, write their names, or read without their mouths moving...  Oh, the joviality.  Watching the news last night, I heard the latest chant - to the tune of "She'll be Coming Round the Mountain."  sing with me here:  "If it wasn't for the English, you'd be Krauts."  (repeat ad nauseum)  Now, is it me, or was the Second World War the Allies versus the Germans and their Allies?  Isn't it plausible that in the last 60 years, had the German invasions gone ahead, a rebellion would have sprung up to overthrow them.  Isn't it the remotest possibility that the German invasion could have overstretched the German war effort and the entire thing could have been halted just months after it had begun???  Or is it just me?  One more thing.  Since when did the English fight their own battles?  I believe at every turn that we've started a war, we've either lost outright (India) or required help (WWI and II) or suffered mind-meltingly large numbers of casualties?  This merely highlights why I hate most people.  I can't handle people who are idiots, stupid, or narrow-minded.  This counts out most people, more of them seem to like football.  It's like fundamental religious zealots; they simply don't understand that there's another opinion that's equally valid.  Don't get me started on those St. Georges flags on cars everywhere in this land.

      Little of you may know that I work as a teacher.&nbsp;  This unique insight into the inner workings of the education system has  led me to some wonderful anecdotes for dinner parties, the pub, and  various other soapbox arenas.  Some people have criticised teachers in  the past for their role in churning out conformist pupils of a specific  disposition to be a useful, and wonderful member of society.&nbsp; I am often  reminded by the Pink Floyd song The Wall (pt. 2) that this was commonly  the view.&nbsp; Whilst I am not to unfamiliar with Dave Gilmour's sparse  Stratocaster wail, I am certainly not in agreement with the view of the  lyrics.  In teaching, we try - nay, we are expected - to educate  youngsters with no interest in school, or the subject; and develop them as  well rounded, moral, and spiritual individuals.&nbsp; Conformity  factories???&nbsp; I don't think so.  I am constantly attempting to  shred years of misconceived knowledge and swathes of  self-confidence issues to reach the inner pupil.&nbsp; Those pupils  who allow such a thing to happen gain a wonderful insight to the world at  large, gaining an appreciation of everything in life, from a tiny atom to the  universe.  However, these pupils are few and far between.&nbsp;  Most teenagers that cross my path are so individual that they form part of  their own crews, or "clubs" as I like to call them.&nbsp; The girls who seek  solace in the arms (and other areas) of the opposite sex; the boys who  take advantage of them all; and the clubs who are so desperate to be adults,  they partake of all the trappings of the aforementioned age of  humankind.  The trials of such a profession can wear one down like a  cigarette butt on the streets outside a pub on a Saturday night.&nbsp; In  fact, so disruptive are these pupils, that often I cannot complete a tenth of  the work that has been planned.&nbsp; And it's not me, and it's not the  school, it is the pupils themselves.  Often I have looked to seek some  form of behavioural adjustment, and often it has failed.&nbsp; By the time  the pupils arrive in my classroom at the age of 11, their role models have  been made, the example has been set, and their misbehaviour has begun in  earnest.  I love my job - bits of my job - and I love that no 2 days  are the same, regardless of how inflexible the timetable can be.&nbsp; I hate  that so many pupils simply cannot understand that teacher's have been there,  and seen it, and done it all too many times to count, to take the benefit  of our experience.  Ruminate, dear reader(s), on this point.&nbsp; If  teenagers really did know best, would you want them in  the government??&nbsp; Discuss.

      I've only been back at work a few days and already tired beyond belief.  Thing is - teaching isn't just a 9-5 profession.  In fact my day starts at 8 and finished at 3; still not a bad day I hear you scream, but there are few professions which are as emotionally engaging in the world.  Besides teaching, I also work with a few of the pupils after school in a musical capacity.  I play guitar, and drums, and sing a bit, so I've been asked from time to time help them sort out various parts, and harmonies, and even sing.  The current trenche of talents are Metallica's "Sad But True", "Nothing Else Matters" (same band, same album), and "For Whom The Bell Tolls."  All of which are to be ready for our Summer Extravaganza on the 1st July.  Heaven help me, as I have to sing - again.  I've never been a great singer.  I used to be really terrible, not hitting the right notes, or anything else, and failing to sing in one key, rather singing in all keys at the same time.  Strangely, after a prolonged illness - including a small spell on a ventilator - I learnt to talk, and indeed sing again.  Now, despite a deep voice, I'm quite good.  So, here I am staring down the latter half of a busy, but boring day, tired out of my mind, having to spend the next hour entertaining myself on my laptop, and then sing for my petrol money.  Heaven's to Betsy, how shall I cope?  Answers on a postcard please to...

      Well, I have to say - just when you set up a blog account to complain to all and sundry, you find you have nothing to complain about.  However, today, that is not the case.  It would seem that here in the UK people simply lose IQ points in direct proportion to the amount of sunshine.  Here's the example.  Last night - gorgeously warm, still happily in the low 20's (Celsius) and I went outside to rescue my cat from a bizarre form of foliage.  What could I smell?  Barbeques!  I live in a very small area, and there were loads of them.  Charcoal and fat, chicken, pork, and beef; the air was rife.  Wine, beer, and cider flowed like rivers, and a cornucopia of music jostled the air for my attention.    Why?  I don't know.  When the sun comes out, I run and hide in my cool and dark cave.  I hate the sunshine.  Not true, I hate being hot and sticky.  The sun is a gorgeous thing, and to be fair, life would not be the same without it.  In fact, this very day Venus is transiting it, but people seem to be unintelligent and sit out bombarding themselves with UV rays to the point of lobster style colouring; talk aimless rubbish while poorly cooking meat and bread, and feasting like there is not a care in the world.  I suppose moreover than the event itself, is just the sheer indulgence of it.  The "no matter what else goes on in the world, so long as I'm alright" greed and selfishness of it all really pisses me off.  That said - I'm hungry now.

                     Tell me, right, why is it impossible to find anything that  you're looking for if it's slightly off the beaten track.&nbsp; I have a lot of  interests, and I like a lot of specialised things - one of them is AD&amp;D  (Dungeons and Dragons for the plebs) and Warhammer 40,000 - both of which need a  massive array of dice.&nbsp; Can I find any when I want them?&nbsp; NO!&nbsp;  This is a royal pain in the butt if you're looking for them.&nbsp; Luckily, I  found a website that sells them in the UK - it's legendgames.co.uk.&nbsp; Thanks  to them my dice needs will be fulfilled.      &nbsp;    Now, to the rest of the idiot people I've bumped into today,  some literally as opposed to figuratively.&nbsp; I HATE YOU ALL!      &nbsp;    Best wishes, Tim

                     I've been frequenting chat rooms now for a long time.&nbsp;  Since about 1995 I've been in and out of various places looking for similar  minded individuals to chat and share ideas; debate the goings on of today, bitch  about their friends, talk films and music, and everything else.      &nbsp;    The trouble is - there are none.      &nbsp;    Every chat room I go into is populated by people trying to get  laid, people pretending to be what they are not - namely 19 year old female  college student/strippers instead of 40 year old flabby guy called Bob.&nbsp; If  it's not them, it's the automated "Bots" that bombard you with meaningless  messages inviting you to join this room, that room, or see this site where there  are thousands of pictures of them in the nude - or see their 100% live cam  action.      &nbsp;    I have been known to be one of them.&nbsp; To sell my wares -  namely myself - in these chat rooms.&nbsp; But as I get older I realise that I'm  more interested in chatting, and that the rooms that allow you to talk freely  are limited at best.      &nbsp;    Still - here I am, still trying and still hoping that  somewhere in the world there is a pseudo-intellectual hoping to argue the pros  and cons of democracy, autocracy, rebalancing the riches of the world, and so  forth.      Searching in vain...
