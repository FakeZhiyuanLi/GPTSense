       Every now and again, Karen any my self put 100 bucks on either black or red. Last night the ball stopped on green, go figure. Just before we left the table a 100 bucks poorer, a kind stranger pointed out that we only lost R50. Our luck turned and we left about 10 minutes later with R900, thats R800 profit. Thanks  urlLink Monte .

       Apple Computer Inc. on Wednesday said its iPod mini digital music player would be available internationally, beginning July 24, at a price of $249. In March, the company said it would delay the international launch of the player due to stronger-than-expected U.S. demand and tight supplies of the hard drive, which is at the core of the player.  Apple had originally planned to start worldwide shipping in April. Earlier this year, the company said it had 100,000 preorders for the iPod mini, a smaller version of the popular iPod player that is about the length and width of a business card and holds about 1,000 songs. The company, best known for its Macintosh computers, has found huge success in digital music. Apple has sold more than 3 million iPods and has a 50-percent market share of digital music players. Its iTunes online music service is the most popular legal music download sites, claiming 70 percent of all songs bought online.

        Lance Armstrong is obsessed with numbers: He measures his seat height by the millimeter, his food by the gram, and his performance by the watt. Such attention to detail is de rigueur in cycling, one of the most data-driven sports of all. Consider the numbers behind the Tour de France: 21 days of riding; 2,110 miles; 5,200 calories burned per day; a peak of 1,000 watts output at any given moment (enough juice to run seven iMacs). The two most important figures: 6, the number of consecutive victories Armstrong will have if he wins the Tour again (a new record); and 61, the number of seconds he won by last year, his narrowest margin yet.

       Winner of the lowest heart rate in 2004? Phonak’s Santiago Perez of Spain, with 31 beats per minute. Yellow jersey for the biggest lung capacity? Another Spaniard, this time of the French Ag2r squad, Mikel Astarloa with 7.98 litres.   The race’s lightest rider is the Russian Alexandre Botcharov at a frankly puny 54.5 kilograms, while the heaviest rider is Sweden’s Magnus Backstedt (Alessio-Bianchi) who will fly down the mountains thanks to his gravity-embracing 98 kilograms.   But the big Swede is prevented taking first prize in the tallest rider competition. Instead, the title goes to a Frenchman: Guillaume Auger of RAGT at 1.96 metres. French fans must be going crazy: there’s a second win for them, too, thanks to Ag2r’s Samuel Dumoulin who obviously never ate his greens, measuring just 1.58 metres.   Among the Tour’s 188 starters, average height is 1.79 metres, average weight is 69.9kg, average lung capacity is 5.74 litres, while the Tour peloton’s average heart rate is 51 beats per minute.

        This special pair of Oakley sunglasses with a built-in MP3 player that Lance Armstrong was spotted wearing. No idea whether they’re planning to ever sell these or not, but a little bit of research reveals that the sunglasses only have enough room on them for 35 songs, which makes us think that they probably have somewhere around 128MB of storage somwhere in there.
