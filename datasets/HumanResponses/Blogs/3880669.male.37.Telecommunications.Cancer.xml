						   Every now and then you see a post on one of the forums that goes something like this.  “I played for 5 hours in the Luton Hold-Em comp on Wednesday night, finished 6th and only got £x it’s not fair the lower places should get more money”.   This is something I disagree with strongly.  Look at it like this.  During the rebuy phase you start with 500 chips, you buy some more depending on rebuys obviously.  Say you have 3 rebuys and so have paid for 2000 chips.  It doesn’t matter how many, what I’m saying is that you bought 2000 (or however many) chips.  At the end of the game how many chips do you have ?  If you finish 6th, none obviously.  So, you’ve lost all your chips.  You should be grateful to be given any money at all !  It’s the guy who wins who as a real cause for complaint.  He has won ALL the chips.  But he only gets paid 40% of their value.  Bad beat !  And people want to make first prize even less !     I play to win.  I adapt my play to the structure at hand.  I’m not interested in £80 for finishing 9th when first is a grand, £1500 or more.  I enjoy playing like this too.  If you don’t like playing 5 hours for little reward then you are IN THE WRONG GAME.  Why have you chosen to play on a Wednesday, when there are 100 runners ?  When it takes all night to finish the game ?  When only 5% of the field gets a decent return ?    You’ll have to ask yourself this question, but a lot of people play this game because of a misconception as to what value (or should that be valyoo) is.  There is a lot more to selecting your tournaments than the size of first prize.  Tournaments with fewer runners give you more chance of a decent return, more time to play (generally) and usually have weaker fields (on average).  You can’t win £3000 in one night but so what ?  One night isn’t how you should be thinking about it.  Think about over the whole year.  Or five years.  Or a lifetime.   Play to win and think harder about which game you should be in instead of asking the world to change to suit you !

						   Last week the “European Championships” are ran at the Vic.  They held two satellites on the Sunday and a huge one on Friday, the night before the main event.  Was I there, chasing the big prize ?  No way !  These satellites are a bad deal IMO.  Here’s why :     ·         Tough fields.  The satellites themselves are a bit of a mixture, but many of the best players do play.  But winning a seat is only half the battle.  Then you have to come back and play in a very tough line up.  About as tough as it gets.  Not good !   ·         Small chance of winning.  Apparently on the Sunday there were 100 runners in the £2500 Satellite, with 10 seats given away.  Satellite entrants had a 10% chance of winning a seat (less if not prepared to rebuy).  If you qualify, 10% of the field usually get paid in the main event.  That’s two 9-1 shots, a 99-1 double !  You have a 1% chance of making any money at all.  Variance is off the scale.   ·         Even smaller chance of a big win.  The majority of the money goes to the top three places (which is only right, I have no complaint with that).  If your target comp has 150 runners, you have a 1 in 50 chance of finishing top 3.  Parlay that up with your 10% chance of winning a seat – 500 to 1.  And that’s assuming your skill level is around the average !   ·         Double rake.  The Vic made £25 from every direct entrant, that’s all they’re allowed to.  But with the satellites, 100 entrants at £10 each makes £1000 from 10 seats !  Plus the £250 they take off the satellite winners !  And if you do win a seat, your expenses (travelling, time off etc) are doubled as well.   ·         Time consuming.  4 hours in a satellite plus, if you win, 5 or 6 hours average in the comp, 14-16 hours or more to make the money !  Not a problem if you consider it as entertainment, but this is time you could be making money in better games.    ·         Satellites, IMO, aren’t entertaining at all.  They are boring !  Survive, survive, survive.  Repeat ad nauseam while waiting for someone else to be knocked out.  Zzzzzzzz   ·         Collusion.  I tend to downplay fears of collusion in normal tournaments.  There isn’t a great deal someone can do to help a partner without hurting themselves almost as much.  In other words it’s not easy for a partnership to gain a significant edge over the rest of the field by colluding.  And because most colluders aren’t the sharpest tools in the box, they don’t know how to do it right anyway (and no, I’m not going to tell you).  In a super-satellite, it’s a different story.  Once you get close to the end, you often find that up to half the remaining players are virtually certain of qualifying.  These players can help their mates out a lot without endangering themselves at all.  And the correct strategy is pretty obvious – when your mate goes all-in, you fold !  I believe this goes on quite a lot.  You even see people who won’t normally do anything out of order enter a super-sat with their partner, and if either one wins, the stronger player will take the seat.  This amounts to the same thing.  If you’re playing it straight, on your own, this can really hurt you sometimes.   Of course, as always in poker, there are upsides as well.  You can learn from watching the good players around you ;  it’s quite exciting, in a way, to play for big money ;  and of course if you do get lucky you could net a big score (although I could say the same about the lottery).  However, I do think you can learn a lot in £50 comps (try Saturday nights in Luton, lots of good players, too many for my liking).  And you can play for quite a lot of money (surely enough to get excited about) in £100 and £200 comps without all this screwing around with satellites.    Anyway I’ll give them a miss.  Just one more thing, in the style of Columbo, to think about.  If you derive a lot of self-esteem from playing and being seen in the biggest games around, get a grip.  You could get professional therapy for a fraction of the cost and a real, long-term benefit.  I’m deadly serious.

						   For many years, QPR played in the biggest game in town.  They weren’t one of the major faces, but they were nobody’s fish.  They made a decent living and were quietly respected by those who knew.  Unfortunately, one year they ran bad.  A number of poor decisions (trying to replace Les Ferdinand with the 88 year old Mark Hateley springs to mind) and they were forced out into the next game down.  What did they do ?  Accept what had happened, keep playing within their means and rebuild ?  Did they arse !  They went on stone bonking raging tilt.     QPR gambled big to try to regain their former status.  A lot of money was splashed around on some big bets.  Some came off for a while (John Spencer), others were losers from the start (Mike Sheron).  QPR started borrowing big, desperately trying to get back in the biggest game.  That money went, but they wouldn’t slow down.  Soon they were raising blind.  Vinny Jones ?  Eventually the inevitable happened.  Rangers were forced out of the second-tier game and went broke.   The end for our brave boys ?  Not at all.  Rangers then did what every true poker player would do, stony broke with creditors queuing round the block.  They stiffed everyone.  In football this is called “going into administration”, but face it, they just knocked them all back.  Not while we’re playing !  I don’t know how football clubs get away with it.  All the nippers in the poker world could learn a lot from QPR and Leicester, Ipswich and Wimbledon.   Now Rangers are back in the 50 round of each, also known as Division Two.  Newly humble, they are working hard, grinding it back up, and avoiding the eyes of those they nipped.  You get all sorts in this game.  Other sad cases with so many memories and stories of better times (Sheffield Wednesday) ;  spotty kids in sunglasses who’ve only been in the game 5 minutes (Rushden and Diamonds) ;  the Essex cab-drivers (Colchester), the streetwise Londoners (Brentford) and the dour northerners (Stockport) who have always played in this game, and always will, give or take.   Just recently Rangers went on a bit of a run, built up a decent stake and got it all in on a 50-50 shot which would have got them into a bigger game again – but Big Sam won the hand and took the seat himself.  But at least they’re working hard, and still in action.  And as long as you’re still in action, then you’ve got a chance.

						   What’s with Hold-Em anyway ?  Why is Europe and particularly Britain obsessed with hold-em to the exclusion of all other tournament games ?  I have a strong preference for both Stud and Omaha and feel that the good player has a much bigger edge in these games.   Let’s start with Hold-Em.  That’s what they play on TV.  NL Hold-em is invariably the game when the tournament stakes are highest.  If you’re a wannabe Devilfish or Moneymaker it’s the only game to play.  If you are a wannabe money maker though (aren’t I clever), I’m not so sure.  Not so sure at all.  Hold-em, especially No-Limit, is just too damn easy to play when the blinds get high.  Wait for a hand you like and shove it in.  Just one decision to make, and not a hard one.  No one’s going to get it wrong with AA, KK, QQ and AK.  No one’s going to get it wrong with 72, T4, 35 and 85% of all the hands in the deck.  If anyone gets it wrong with the small number of inbetweeny hands like two pictures or a middle pair, they’re not going to get it very wrong.  A good player, ducking and diving, playing the situations and the players, doing everything he can, is going to do better than the guy whose grasp of strategy amounts to “Me like cards go all in”.  BUT NOT MUCH.  Even if your simplistic opponent is calling instead of raising, he’s only in real trouble when you can find an overpair against him.  And those hands just don’t come along very often.  Notice I said an overpair, not AK.  That’s because AK is only a 2-1 favourite over the worst hand in the deck, 72.  And 2-1 shots come in quite a lot …   You could say the same about Omaha.  When the blinds are high, a bit of a crap-shoot.  Maybe, but not as much of one.  There is a lot less pre-flop raising in Omaha tournaments.  Good players know that they should keep the pot smaller until they see the flop.  That’s where you outplay your weaker opponents in Omaha.  And the weaker players just don’t know where they are pre-flop.  It’s not as easy as “big pair or AK means raise”, like Hold-em.  So more of them (not all) tend to just call as well.  All this means you get much more play on the flop.  More time, more decisions to be made, to sort the sheep from the goats.  When the blinds are high, you have to put some raises in.  But at least you don’t have your legs taken out from under you when the rock finds AA behind you.  If you choose your hands properly, you are usually only a 2-1 dog against anything, even Aces in Omaha.  And that’s the other thing.  People mis-value their hands in short-stack situations.  Hold-em players love pairs in their hand but any pair apart from Aces is an implied odds hand in Omaha.  You want to take a flop cheap and try to hit a set.  In an all-in or committal situation you would usually prefer to have 4 different cards to hit straights and two pair with.  Especially against the main hand that’s going to call you – AAxx .   Pot-limit Stud is just about the best tournament game you can play against weak players.  It’s a shame that it’s only regularly played in one card-room in the world.  But it’s great that that card-room is 30 minutes from my flat !  Last year I won 7 out of 54 small stud tournaments I played in.  Given the size of the field that’s about 5 times more often than average.  If you can do that in Hold-em you have either found a fantastic game or you are a hell of a player, or both.  Sometimes Ram Vaswani plays in the £50 Stud tournaments in Luton (thankfully for me, the £20 events are beneath him).  I’d back him at 4-1 in a field of 50.  Maybe less.  I don’t want to give away too many trade secrets here.  I don’t mind telling you how much I win or lose but exactly how I do it – coaches in the car park :-).  A great deal of it is not because it’s Stud per se, but because the game is played with antes rather than blinds.    In conclusion, maybe I have answered my own question.  Weak, inexperienced players don’t get ironed out in tournament Hold-em like they would in the other two games.  They have a chance, they stay in action, they get a few results and so do their friends.  That’s why Hold-Em tournaments sell out.  Credit to Luton and the Vic though for putting at least one Omaha and one Stud comp in most of their festivals.  If you see me at a festival between now and Christmas, it’s likely to be in one of those.  If you see me at a festival at all, but that one’s for another day.

						   I don’t read the papers much but I was leafing through the Times last weekend and I saw Danny Baker’s column.  I like Danny Baker (whatever anyone says) so I read it, and he was talking about meeting Jimmy White.  The Bakemeister reported “He told me that, as well as still being in snooker’s top sixteen, he was also the world poker champion, which was something I didn’t know”.  That’s something none of us knew !  I don’t remember the Poker Million 2 being upgraded to World Championship status J.    Whether the Whirlwind really said that or it was just a bit of journalistic license from the Crafty Cockney, who knows.  Hey, I don’t care, it’s not as though he’s stolen the title from me.  And I had £10 on him to win the thing anyway !  How did he do it ?  How did I know he was going to do it ?    Of course I didn’t.  I just had a fair idea that with a fast clock and a No-Limit structure, any aggressive player had a chance.  10-1 was good odds.  Pot-Limit I would have needed 20-1 or more.  And this simple fact blows all this crap about “No-Limit is the Cadillac of poker games” out of the window.  Cash games where everyone has huge stacks and 3 days to set up their opponents, maybe.  Tournaments, no.  People win No-Limit tournaments who wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell playing PLHE or PLO.    Because when you get lucky in No-Limit, you can get lucky for all someone’s chips.  All in one go and that’s them fucked.     It must be said though that at times the better players push themselves out on a limb.  Ready to be sawn off.  Many players are so conditioned to playing aggressively they don’t know any other way.  Classic example from the Poker Million heat, Roy Brindley and Steve Davis were heads up, fairly equal chips.  All Brindley needed to do was sit tight, play poker, keep chipping away and not give Davis a chance to get lucky.  What he did was blast it all in with some crap (ten high or something I can’t remember), Davis found AQ, thank you and goodnight.  Then in the final Joe Beevers (who ought to know better, I’m not sure about Roy) went all in with an Ace, and Jimmy called with 64 suited.  At least Joe was in front, but why shove it all in and give his weaker opponent a chance to get lucky ?  Don’t ask me.  I don’t know.   If you ask anyone what’s so great about No-Limit they say “well you can lose all your chips on one hand, one mistake and it’s over”.  Well, one bad beat and it’s over too.  A good player can normally manipulate a weaker opponent into getting the chips in as a 60-40 favourite (on average).  If you can beat someone 60% of the time, which would you prefer, best of five or a one-off decider ?  In Pot-Limit (to simplify) you get a best of five (or a better analogy might be that you play till someone gets a 3 point lead).  In No-Limit it’s all or nothing.  Is the Tennis World Championships played over one game ?  Snooker over one frame ? Golf over one hole ?  Of course not.  So why is poker so often played over one hand ?

						   I do appreciate people coming on here to read my insane babbling so I am going to throw you a bone or two.  Some useful hints as to how to put me on tilt.  These are the things to do at a poker table which wind me up.  You might get yourself beaten to a pulp if I see you in the car park and no one else is around (and you’re smaller than me) but them’s the breaks.  Number 1 :   If there is one thing that gets on my tits in poker tournaments it’s the habit that some people have of endlessly analysing every hand.  What did you have ?  Was I right to call ?  Would you play the hand like that ?  Oh sorry, is it me, hang on while I fumble around with my cards a bit more, I call.  Oh it’s been raised ?  How much ?  Oh, er, um.  PAY ATTENTION.  The next time someone asks me “Was I right to call” * I’m going to say “God No, that’s the worst call I’ve ever seen”.  And if that doesn’t work we might end up having a real post mortem.     * Especially if they do it in the style of a Scottish great-aunt asking for just one wee piece of shortbread.  You know who you are.

						   Poker has so many parallels in real life.  Poker is life, some would say !  Here is a tale of woe that a good poker player would have avoided.  From the Enfield Advertiser, 2nd July 2003 :   “Jo-Ann Bowen-Griffith, who won the Hampstead Garden Suburb in Bloom competition in 2001, spotted some begonias being sold at a reduced price in Homebase … but when she went to pay for the plant, the checkout assistant accused her of swapping a £12 tag for a £1 tag … The matter probably could have been resolved peacefully had Miss Bowen-Griffith not spotted two of her biggest gardening rivals in a neighbouring queue.  ‘When I saw them I became even more embarrassed and demanded an apology even more adamantly’, she told the jury … Miss Bowen-Griffith was seeking aggravated damages for defamation”   Leaving aside for the moment exactly how you can have a “gardening rival”, Miss B-G did not leave her ego at home like any good poker player would.  She also risked a huge amount for a small payout, going “all-in” to a very small pot.  How much ?  She lost the case, and is now liable for £45,000 in legal fees.  If only she had spent more time in smoky casinos and less out in the fresh air.   In closing, let us consider the words of that great sage Nelson Muntz.  Ha Ha !

						   The other Saturday I played the £100 Hold-Em tournament in Luton .  Before the start I bumped into that well known Internet reprobate “The Camel”.  “Haven’t seen you at a Hold-Em comp for a while” he said, before we moved to the bar and started talking about QPR instead.  He was right, I haven’t been playing a lot of Hold-Em lately.  Here’s why :   In 2001, I played 53 £20 and £50 tournaments in Luton (mostly £50).  I cleared almost exactly £100 per competition, £5,400.  Last year I played 40 and cleared £230, at £5 a night barely enough to cover BFH as they used to say in Bullseye.  Bus fare home !  This year I’m £1,050 down.  In fact I have put together a spectacular run of 21 of these tournaments without making the money.  Considering all Hold-Em tournaments the run is currently around 30.  Needless to say I have given some thought to the question “what the hell is going on ?”.  The possible reasons can be broken down into three categories :   1)       The game has changed   There’s no doubt this is true.  Games always change, they grow and shrink, evolve and devolve.  Have the games changed in such a way to explain my results ?  Maybe.  In 2001, the Saturday night game was a very good game, and that was the game I played the most.  There weren’t too many top players, and quite a few loosies chasing the biggest prize pot of the week.  However, word got around, one way or the other.  More and more good players started turning up to take advantage.  Once certain players who spend 90% of their time in cash games at the Vic turn up to a weekly tournament, you know the party’s over.  Not because they’re great players, but because this is a sign that the particular tournament was good value 3 months ago.  But it isn’t any more.   Anyway, the weaker players didn’t win as often and I suspect many migrated to Wednesday night which has now become the biggest night of the week, often a full house.    The fields on Saturdays are now much tougher.  Play Wednesday then ?  Not so fast.  Wednesday is a £20 comp with 100 runners.  For various reasons which I will discuss soon (but not today), the good player’s edge is cut dramatically.  Plus it goes on till 3 am and more – not good on a school night !   In addition, the more perceptive of you might have remembered that add-ons were introduced in late 2001.  I don’t think this has affected my earn, but it’s hard to tell.  However, as a player who tends to the conservative in rebuying, I think the addons have increased my variance.  I won’t win as often.  But when I do I should win more.  Not sure on this one.  Addons certainly didn’t harm my Stud results.   2)       I have changed     Am I playing as well as I did in 2001 ?  Another tough one.  There is no doubt that I’m not as confident, which must have some effect.  But when you turn over AK and your opponent JJ, it really doesn’t matter how confident you are.  It might feel a lot different, but it isn’t.  As I haven’t been doing so well, I haven’t been playing as often.  I have only played 12 of these comps in the first half of this year (compare to 55 in the whole of 2001).  Maybe there is a corresponding loss of sharpness.  I have been trying some different plans and theories – now is the time after all.  Don’t screw with your game too much when you’re winning, that’s for sure.  Some of these new plans might not be good ideas in the long run.  And frankly I just haven’t been trying very hard lately.  After about half an hour I’m bored and wish I was at home.  So instead of rebuying, I hit the rail.   3)       Them’s just the breaks   Even 55 tournaments isn’t very many.  Think of the difference a win more or less can make – anything up to £3000 !  It’s human nature to assume that 2001 was the way things should be, and everything since has been caused by bad luck and buggeration factors.  But there’s no logical reason why that should be so.  I ran hot in 2001, and cold since.  Overall I have cleared £4,700 in 105 comps.  I’d certainly like that £ number to be higher, but it’s not bad.  Most players would swap with me for sure.    So what’s the verdict ?  Nothing is clear-cut in poker.  A bit of all three but mostly the last I reckon.  Fortunately (praise be) Luton run the softest tournaments in the world – the Stud comps.  Since the start of 2002, while I have been struggling with the Hold-em, I have cleared £10,000 in 80 stud comps.  Just running hot ?  Maybe so.  I’ll let you know in about 20 years when the fluctuations are covered.  In the meantime, now you know why I’m not seen too often on the Hold-Em nights.   Finally a postscript .. I know 2 or 3 guys who are running great in Hold-em tournaments right now.  They haven’t been playing too long, but they’re enjoying themselves, playing a lot, larging it up, giving lessons at the table, chirping with the chips.  But we’ll see how good these boys are when they string together 20 without a win.  We’ll see how they cope when that happens.  And we’ll see how cocky they are then too J.

						   Why are we all here, but let’s not get all existential.  I have decided to quit the well-known poker forums at least for the meantime, and post my thoughts here instead.  Why ?  Unfortunately the signal-to-noise ratio on all the European forums has deteriorated badly over the last few months.  Mostly they are saturated with anonymous smart-arses who have nothing to contribute at all.  When someone makes an effort to post something constructive and well thought-out, they are met with replies of “bollocks” and “you’re a wanker” and so on.    These are open forums and I have always said that censorship should be minimised in these forums, so what can I do.  All I can do is decide that I can’t be bothered with it any more.  Life’s too short !  However I do enjoy organising my thoughts and soliciting feedback from anyone who does want to be constructive, so here I am.   So I’m going to talk about anything I feel like.  I will be quoting some numbers regarding my results in poker, which is not something that’s very common, but a lot of people are interested to hear I think.  We’ll see how it goes.

						   First of all I must apologise for the delay in updating the diary.  I have been moving house - I am now resident in Enfield's premier yuppie apartment block (and that's saying something).  Hopefully the minor technicality that I haven't finished selling my old flat yet won't result in me moving once more, into Enfield's premier gutter.  While this was ongoing, literally one E-mail dripped in demanding an update.  So here it is :

						   I did promise you some gossip from Tunica, but unfortunately the fact that Eskimo Clark sleeps in his car is apparently common knowledge - well I didn't know.  Glamorous all the same though isn't it ?  Apart from that I did catch a couple of the WSOP programmes on ESPN.  There was a 1-hour programme devoted to each day, I saw the ones covering days 3 and 4.  These are very well done, the commentary is good and the atmosphere comes over very well.  However I did hear something that calls the whole concept into question.   Now this is hearsay (I heard a guy say it), he seemed sincere to me and I can’t think of any reason why he would make it up – anyway judge for yourself.  There was a hand on day 3 where on the ESPN show, Chuc Hoang (sp ?) has KK in his hand, and Scotty Nguyen has AK.  The flop is Kxx.  Hong goes all in with his trip Kings, Scotty has a bit of a dwell-up and passes.  A great pass, yes ?  Well maybe.  This guy I was talking to said he was at the table, and there were no card-cameras (it was not the main featured table).  Furthermore, NOBODY saw Scotty’s cards.  He just mucked them.  Our confidant went on to say that, from the play of previous hands, he thought there was no way Scotty could have had AK and that other players at the table agreed.  So, did Scotty really pass AK ?  Or did he just tell the ESPN guys that was what he had ?  It’s not hard to think of reasons why he might want to do that.  Should we take all this coverage with a pinch of salt ?  One to think about.   Finally in an attempt to shame myself into never doing this again, here is the worst play I have ever made.  Midway through the Omaha tournament I am doing OK with average chips.  In the big blind I pick up something including 98.  No betting until the turn makes the board 765x, so I have the nuts, with 2 diamonds out.  I bet the pot (400) 1 caller.  On the river I still have the nuts.  I bet 400 and he raises 1000.  At this point I must have suffered some kind of brain freeze because even though it's true that he really can't call a reraise without the nuts, it wouldn't hurt to try - but I just call and he shows 48.  DOH !!  At least the Devilfish was on the next table, not there to pour scorn on me !

						   ... but how you played the game.  Is how you play the game more important than whether you win or lose ?  Most people would say of course not.  Most people, in this post-Thatcher world, would mock someone who said that.  Would you ?  Listen up before answering …   I used to play a lot of cricket.  I suppose it was my main hobby, much like poker is now.  However, when the game became full of oiks with no respect for their opponents, their team-mates or themselves, I lost interest (hmm sounds familiar).  Now I look back on my cricketing “career” (in quotes because I really wasn’t very good at all).  What do I regret ?  Losing this game, being relegated that season ?  No.  None of that matters now.  What I regret is that we had a bent umpire and we never did anything about it.  I’m still embarrassed about the cheating that went on, to my benefit.  It got to the point where I would never appeal unless it was stone plumb out but that wasn’t enough.  There were reasons, or should that be excuses, as to why I didn’t stand up to it.  The guy was in his eighties I think, he was a lifelong member of the club, there were pictures on the wall from 1927 (for once I am not exaggerating) with him in them.  In fact he passed away shortly after I left the club.  Anyway, that’s what I regret.  I think of the times when opponents would as much as call us cheats, and we couldn’t say anything, because it was true.  And I hang my head in shame.   I hope that when I look back on my poker playing I will have a clearer conscience.  Incidentally the other thing I regret (though a lot less) is that I didn’t just stop worrying about what people thought, whether I was good enough, whether I would be dropped next week, and just PLAY.  Do my best and nuts to what anyone thought.  I’m still working on that.  Getting there though !

						   On my return I had a good old trawl through the Hendon Mob Forum, which seems to attract about 10 times as many posts as the rest put together !  Right down near the bottom of page 2 was a rather vague post about “helping” British players to do better at next year’s WSOP.  No doubt the poster has good intentions, but asking low-limit poker players to “help” the Devilfish & co is a bit like asking turkeys to vote for Christmas, IMO, and here’s why.   There is no doubt in my mind that every May a big chunk of money leaves the UK poker economy, never to be seen again.  Most of it is simply lost by players who aren’t ready (and maybe never will be ready) to mix it at that level.  A few people, whether by luck or ability, get a result or two in the tournaments, only to give it back in the cash games, the pit, or the remaining competitions.  Even fewer record a good result and are sensible enough to keep hold of most of it.  So most of the money stays in Vegas, and that which doesn’t is concentrated in a few (like two or three) pockets, and not much of this is going to make it back into the UK poker economy.   Now, if you want to go and play the WSOP for whatever reason (although I suspect that most of those who go West are being led there by their egos), fine, it’s your money.  But to suggest that you need “help”, in whatever form, from the UK poker community at large, is little less than insulting.  Bugger off and lose your own money :-).  As you have noticed I have typed the word help as “help” throughout this because it was not at all clear what kind of help the proponent had in mind, although sponsorship and satellites were mentioned.  Satellites I have covered elsewhere, though I will add that I believe the whole “festival” scene in Europe, and probably all over the world, is propped up by the dead money put in through satellites and over-optimistic local players.  Corporate sponsorship (although unlikely to happen anyway IMO) would be much better for poker if injected at the bottom, not the top.  Money added to smaller, local tournaments and cash games (high hand prizes maybe) would tempt more people into cardrooms more often and keep the game alive at the bottom of the pyramid.   What little corporate sponsorship there is at the moment is all directed into large buy-in tournaments.  Most of it ends up in the casino vaults and what remains is in very few pockets.  This doesn’t help poker at all IMO, in fact it might harm it by directing even more attention to these ego-fests.  Quite frankly the reason that European players have struggled in the WSOP recently is down to one very simple fact.  The “faces” aren’t as good as they think they are.  And you’ll have to help yourselves on that one.

						   That was the deal in Tunica last week on my poker holiday.  The games were good, I was playing reasonably well, probably the best I have played abroad, but I couldn’t make a decent score.  Never mind !  Stay tuned over the next few weeks and I will give you all the gossip, including the worst play I ever made, why you shouldn’t believe everything you see on ESPN and which American “face” is so broke he sleeps in his car !

						   Apart from environmental factors that boil (literally at times in this weather) down to more comfortable playing conditions, any other change will benefit some people at the expense of others.  Structures, for example.  If you believe what you hear, everyone wants slower tournaments with more play in them.  Maybe they believe it too, but it’s a simple fact that weaker players shouldn’t want this at all.  If will give the better players more time and scope to outplay them.  Or maybe no one wants to admit (especially to themselves) that they are one of the fish !   A more subtle example is an argument put forward by fans of Internet poker.  You don’t have to drive to games and hang around waiting and so on, you just switch on your computer and it’s there.  How could that possibly not benefit everyone ?  Well it doesn’t help me !   I am about half an hour each way from Luton , and an hour from the Vic.  Not excessive but enough to make a difference.  If when I get there I receive terrible cards all night (or however long it takes) I can fold them.  Not a problem.  But other people can’t.  Other people didn’t drive miles and miles to fold, they came to PLAY.  Thus, they play hands they shouldn’t.  They buy in again when they should quit.  They make terrible plays “because I’m bored”.  Incidentally the record for the soonest I have heard someone say that as they reach into their pocket is 9 minutes into the game – seriously.  If someone gets bored playing online they just quit and surf for porn instead.  Or is that just me.  Anyway, online you are also dealt twice as many hands per hour, and you can play 2 or 3 games at once.  The games rattle along and it’s much less common to see people go on tilt out of sheer boredom.  Players with good card sense but problems with impatience will do a lot better on-line.  Players with no card sense (like me) who gain a big edge in real life just through patience and discipline lose out.   In tournaments, it’s different but kind of the same.  In the B+M world, many players overdo the survival tactics because if they get knocked out, they can’t play again till tomorrow, or Wednesday, or next week.  Online, what the hell, there’s another one in an hour.  You simply can’t pressure opponents as much, or knock them off the best hand as often, because of this.   So the convenience, regularity and speed of online games, which you might think benefit everyone who plays, are major drawbacks for a player like me.  I have a big edge in the real world because I know enough, and I have the discipline, to make the right plays (as I see them anyway J) even if the games are inconveniently located, or infrequent, or slow.  Anything that benefits me a little and my opponents a lot doesn’t in fact benefit me at all, can you dig it ?   Add to that the edge I gain in real life from knowing my opponents, using my image and picking up tells, most of which I lose on-line, and really the only surprise is that it’s taken me this long to work out that Internet poker is not for me.  Maybe I should pledge my support to that campaign in the US to ban Internet poker and force everyone out into the cardrooms.  Imagine the flak I would get for posting that on a forum J.

						   It seems to me that certain people [as I have mentioned before] derive some kind of self-esteem from being seen in the biggest games around, specifically the biggest comps.  Each to his own I suppose.  Expensive business though.  Unless …   It strikes me that in a casino like the Vic, with tables in the cardroom and the bar and upstairs, it wouldn’t be that difficult to pretend you are playing even when you aren’t.  Large it up in the bar beforehand, I feel lucky tonight, this is the big one for me.  Once the comp is called, give it all the “right, good luck mate, see you in the final, just going to freshen up”.  Nip into the Gents and then nip out unobserved while everyone is milling around finding their seats.  All your audience will assume that if they’re in the bar, you must be upstairs, and vice versa.  Anyway pop down the road for a drink or two, or a bite to eat, and roll back 3 hours later “how d’you get on mate ?  Yeah me too, bloody Aces, some bozo I’ve never seen before called me with 7s and made a straight on the river, can you believe it ?”.  No one is any the wiser.  Kudos maintained at no cost.   Such a foolproof scheme that I can only wonder if anyone is doing it already.  I wouldn’t be surprised.  And if you can swap a few percent beforehand, ching ching !!  Now that’s a freeroll.  See you in October !

						   One post on the Mob Forum recently was so interesting that I broke my self-imposed exile and chipped in.  The original question was “How did you make the transition from ‘Joe Average’ to ‘hey that guy/gal’s not a bad player’? I’m thinking specifically about competitions!”.  The poster admitted that the question was ambiguous, which it is, in a very interesting (IMO :-)) way.   Does the poster want to be a good player or to be seen as a good player ?  The latter is much easier, as follows :  urlLink How to look like a winner .  And of course, you don’t want to do both now do you ?  It boils down to the choice that every “new” poker player has to make.  What are you trying to do, make money or be noticed ?  Supplement your income on a regular basis or get your name in Poker Europa ?  Huge numbers of younger players are seduced by the latter.  I’ve been through it myself, but now I think it is a mirage.  Not that I’m complaining.  New, keen players with half an idea (well some of them have) aren’t cluttering up my games, they’re off chasing a million in satellites, on-line and down the Vic.  Tournament “faces” are finding that the circuit is being supported (just) by all the nearly dead (comatose ?) money put in by the wannabees, so they don’t have to drop down either.  Meanwhile I can get to work in their absence.   Because the second interesting post in this thread was one by DY.  David broke his “coaches in the car park” rule to give the (very sound) advice to find other games than Hold-em tournaments.  I have touched on the reasons why previously in this diary, and probably will again, so I’ll leave the technicalities for now.  The reason he felt able to give this advice was the point that no one would pay attention.  Much like Cassandra (in Greek mythology, not Only Fools and Horses), the oracle of truth is doomed to be ignored.  Because what do they play on Late Night Poker ?  What do they play in the WSOP and the WPT, coast-to-coast on ESPN ?  Hold-em of course, No-Limit, the “Cadillac” of games.  Stud ?  What’s the point of that ?  Only one.  It’s much easier to make consistent money against typical weak fields playing Stud.  And Omaha for that matter.  And cash games.  Just that, nothing else.   So pay your money and take your choice.  You think you’re the next Chris Moneymaker ?  Good luck.  I won’t be seeing you !

						   ... someone said this :    urlLink http://www.pokerpages.com/articles/archives/caro25.htm    and very well said too.  Caro is like Sklansky in that you may find his style annoying but an enormous proportion of what he says is correct.    The last time this came up when I was at the table was in a festival comp in Luton .  I went all in, 4 or 5 people called and then the last player to act made a huge reraise, knocked everyone else out and turned over 34s :-).  Quite a clever play really, he knew everyone would fold, now he’s getting 6-1 from the pot and is only a 2-1 dog.  Needless to say though the next 10 minutes turned into an all-out strategy seminar.  I was the only person who didn’t get involved so I suppose I must have been the audience.  What’s really funny is that there were still about 130 players left !  The advantage gained by knocking someone out at this point is so small you would need an electron microscope to see it, for reasons which Caro explains better than I could.   On another occasion I was told by a Late Night Poker finalist that “the idea is to knock players out”.  I said “No, the idea is for me to get chips”, and he let it drop, probably because he thought I was clearly insane and not worth arguing with rather than because I had refuted him.  Anyway there are only a few very specific situations where you make a significant gain by knocking someone out, and of course these are all in or around the money.  And if you have one of the biggest stacks it’s often worth keeping people in !  You’ll have to work out why yourself though :-)

						   They say that if you want to attract hits to your website you should put the word sex * in an invisible font at the top of your front page.  I think for a poker website the key word should be “free”.  Nothing gets a poker player salivating like the prospect of something for nothing.  But is there any such thing ?   If your time is absolutely valueless, then maybe.  If not, you should at least work out what a freeroll is worth and how long it’s going to take.  Simply divide the pot by the number of runners and that’s what it’s worth, more or less.  Walsall , for example, came up with a fiendish plan for their recent Midlands Meltdown.  Anyone who played in one of the first two events could play in a freeroll for one £250 seat in the next day’s comp.  £250 for nothing ?  Sign me up !  Well maybe.  If 50 people turn up to play this, it’s £5 for nothing, which isn’t quite as exciting.  100, then £2.50 for nothing.   If you do have nothing else to do you could still play.  But this is where the fiendishness comes in, and I have to tip my hat to the Walsall boys for this.  Starting stack is 1000.  Starting running antes are 1000.  Everyone plays one hand, the winner on each table advances.  Leaving 90% of the field hanging around with nothing to do for however long (a couple of hours I should imagine) until the real comp starts.  With the bar open.  And the restaurant.  And the pit.  Ching Ching !!  Genius.  * or better still lesbian

						   Another festival at the Vic, and with my ill-gotten Jimmy White gains gathering dust on Betfair, I finally got around to backing the field instead of just going on about how the field is the value in these things. And what happens ? Marcel Luske is heads up with the one remaining fieldster, Jan Boubli. The two players agree a deal whereby all the money is split up and Boubli, the chip leader at that point, will deliberately concede enough chips to make Luske the official winner. This is the absolutely accepted version of events from all witnesses I have heard from. Luske is apparently in the running for the European rankings prize and Boubli isn't, so both players are happy.  I, however, am not especially. Now I appreciate that caveat emptor and all bets are placed at my own risk. I don't think my £10 is really the issue. The issue is that I would challenge anyone to explain to me is how the above situation is different from the following hypothetical case. Everton, in mid-table, take on Bolton, hovering above the relegation zone, in the last game of the season. Bolton pay Everton a large sum of money to throw the game, which they do. That is no different in principle to what happened in this poker tournament.  The difference in practice is simply what is considered acceptable in different sports. For example, in snooker or golf players are expected to call fouls on themselves, and many do on a regular basis. Whereas in football it is standard practice to shout "Our Ball" after launching it into Row Z with no opponent anywhere near you. Any player who went up to the referee and said "actually I handled that, it's a penalty" would be ridden out of town on a rail by an angry mob of team-mates and fans.  So what, in practice, can we do. I posted on the Mob forum (I'm not sure exactly what the Mob's connection with Betfair is but there is certainly some kind of partnership in these poker markets) and received a sympathetic but ultimately "yes but what can we do ?" response. Another poster suggested, also reasonably, that I would have to consider how likely different people are to "throw the game" when placing my bets. That's not how I want to spend my time though, so I will give it a miss in future. Given the amount of money that does change hands on these markets though, I am amazed that no dissatisfied bettors of the field or layers of Marcel are kicking up seven kinds of shit.  In the end, as I said on the forum, players with an interest in furthering poker as a legitimate sport have a responsibility to behave properly and "do the right thing". Ironically I, who have no such interest whatsoever, always try my best but that's for personal reasons. It would help if there was a legitimate players organisation to lay down standards of behaviour (among other things, not least standing up to the blatant exploitation of players by the WPT).  And we now read in the Independent that such a players organisation is being formed. At the forefront is ... Marcel Luske. At this point I rapidly fold my cards up and pass.

						   As I said above, I did post on the Mob forum about the Betfair situation, and I also admit that I have made contributions to the "Celebrity Poker" threads under an assumed name. If anyone does care you can probably guess which one but I doubt if you do [care]. But it does take a lot to make me pop my head above the walls and post on there nowadays, as the quality of debate, if you can call it that, reaches new depths. Currently the forum is flooded with posts by or about (or both) one particular individual. While these are unintentionally amusing at times (I did enjoy the central figure's assertion in about his 534th post that "I bring home the money and that's all I care about) but mostly it's a total turn-off. I couldn't care less how much an individual makes, there will always be a few winners and a lot of losers. If you're doing well good luck to you. But if you do value a forum, always remember that trolls thrive on ANY kind of response. Starve them of this oxygen and they will, in a cyberspace sense, die. Bear it in mind.

						   There’s no shame in admitting that I am a compulsive bookworm when it comes to poker.  Even a bad book can pay for itself many times over if there is a nugget or two of good information inside.  So I checked out Vorhaus’ “Killer Poker Online”.  I like Vorhaus, he’s quite entertaining, in fact he’s a screenwriter who has also written a book called something like “How to be funny even when you’re not”, which I’m sure I would find useful ..   Anyway JV talks a lot about concentrating fully on playing online, turning off all TV, phones, even music, only playing 1 game, taking lots of notes and stuff.  So I tried this in a $5 single table and the difference was unbelievable.  The first time it was so hard I could barely keep up.  Applying my full concentration it was a totally different game.     Now I still can’t see myself making a lot of money online, it just doesn’t pay anywhere near as much as a good live game – for me anyway.  But the concept applies just as much to B&M poker.  I’m sure down below I talk about being bored playing tournament hold-em.  Get a grip !  If you’re bored at the poker table you aren’t trying hard enough.  There’s enough information to keep you going if the game was played 3 or 4 times slower.  So hopefully when I get back to the tables (I’m on a break for a couple of weeks) I can get back to applying myself properly.   Mentally (Vorhaus talks about this too) it’s very easy to be lazy.  It’s tempting to think “well even if I do concentrate really hard some bozo will probably draw out on me”, and I’m sure that’s been my mindset a lot lately.  Sometimes when I’ve been at the table (but with my brain on holiday) I’m watching someone who does quite well make a strange play and wonder what’s going on.  But it’s a simple fact, Fox (the best poker book ever !) says that “the best player in the world with a temporarily dulled brain is not even the match of an average player using full concentration”.  And of course I’m nowhere near the best player in EN2, never mind the world J.   So next time you see me in Luton , I might not be so chatty during the game.  In fact if I am, tell me to sort it out !

						   As I write, yet another slugfest at the Vic reaches its climax.  They don’t half come around quick don’t they !  Time for an anti-satellite tirade then ?  Well I’ll just content myself with one observation.  “I won a satellite so it only cost me £50”.  Really ?  I bow down to your satellite greatness.  You win a seat every time you play one ?  “No, I didn’t say that” – er yes you did, actually.  You can’t just ignore the satellites you lose when working out how much you have “paid”.  If you make money in satellites, good for you, say if you win a £1000 seat for every £500 you put in, that’s good going.  But the seat has cost you £500, not £50.  And if, like 50% of the field, you are below average – you’re paying MORE than £1000 !  How’s that for value ?   In the meantime though, well done to The Camel for carving up the £750 – and who can stop the Mob ?  Is this sponsorship really good for poker if it enables the guys to hoover up so much of the tournament cash ?  I’m half joking.  But I’m half serious too …   And I can’t forget to tip my hat to Ray Brown.  Ray is one of my trickier foes in the regular Luton £20 stud-fests.  Last week he got the cake in Baden for about E100K !  What a result !  Maybe now he’ll be out of my hair in the £20s.  Knowing Ray though I doubt it.  He loves the action.  Makes you think though.  It makes you think “you jammy bastard” :-)

						   Tragic news from the Mirage this week.  It seems that one of the famed white tigers took exception to being bopped on the nose with a microphone once too often and attempted to tear Roy (from Siegfried and Roy of course) limb from limb.   Now, this guy is still critical and I don’t wish that much ill on anyone believe me.  But really, can anyone be surprised ?  Call me a hippy but I think what they do with those tigers is wrong.  I know they go on about preserving the species but couldn’t they do that without making them jump through hoops and charging $50 a ticket ?  I wish the guy a full recovery but perhaps this will be the end of this kind of sideshow in Vegas and that would be for the best IMO.  Plus I hope the tiger doesn't get the chair.  It's only doing what comes natural.

						   I did promise to explain how you can gain an advantage playing in this kind of structure :    urlLink The Aussie Pool Booster   should this ever catch on in Europe .  Though I would hope most of you have worked it out by now if you’ve thought about it !    Basically the “supplementary pool” is a last longer bet.  Maintained by the house and paying more than one place, but absolutely a last longer bet.  When any pair or group of players make a last longer bet, they are giving up an edge to the rest of the field.  It’s obvious why – sometimes they will have to make a different play because of the bet, a play which would be wrong if the bet hadn’t been struck.  For those not in the bet, the play is wrong and to their advantage.  Imagine being 5 or 6 handed in the final of one of these tournaments, when 2 of the players are in the “supplementary” pool.  It should be obvious how to take advantage of this.  So if you find yourself in one of these comps, just play the main pool only, and you’ll have a nice edge.   Incidentally Sklansky (correct as always) maintains that if you make last longer bets, they should be either very small or very large compared to the tournament entry.  Then you just concentrate on whichever is bigger.   And while we’re on the European Poker site, this article is very accurate and well-written, check it out :    urlLink Why So Late ?

						   Something I continually read on discussion forums is “I didn’t want to look stupid” or “I wanted the respect of the other players”.  Why ?  There is a great tendency among tournament “faces” to assume that any unknown face is a lesser player.  Why not play along with this ?  Feign uncertainty about the rules, or if you are uncertain, don’t hide it.  If you do know what you’re doing, you can give the “faces” a nasty shock later on, or re-steal off them without them being any the wiser.  You can keep the respect, I’ll take the money.

						   It’s certainly interesting to read the Mob’s accounts of their tournament adventures on the world’s biggest freeroll.  The guys got off to a good start at the Four Queens but no showing in the last three tournaments ($1K, $1K and $5K) adds up to $28K in less than a week.  Big swings !  Their account seems to tally with my own experience of playing in the US .  There comes a point in these events where the pros decide that it’s worth their while turning up.  Usually when the buy-in reaches $1000, sometimes $500.  At this point the number of locals entering drops off sharply too.  Basically, when the pros fly in, you should fly out.  That’ll be my plan next time – get there for Event 1 and book to leave when the time seems right.  You can always stay on longer if you get lucky !

						   So last night I'm putting my plan into action, an hour's kip after work and then out to Luton for the £20 Stud. An hour in I am wishing I was asleep again - 240 chips in front of me (having just dropped 500 on a poor call) and "Jon's Elton" is banging out "Daniel" in the restaurant. If you were unaware, Luton are trying to "go Vegas" with an entertainer. Now, I subscribe to the theory that musicals are the lowest form of artistic expression, with tribute bands a very close second. To give this guy his due though he is quite a good singer. It's just that it is a little distracting when you're trying to play self-deal with 5 grabbing hands in every pot as usual. All I can hear during the quieter bits is a string of juvenile unfunny remarks (as you can imagine) punctuated by sycophantic laughter. Some people need to grow up, and by the way it is a scientific fact that people who are unsure of their own sexuality are usually at the front when it comes to this brand of "humour".  Anyway thankfully the music stops but I'm off my game and decide not to add on. Long story short, two hours and 3 big outdraws in my favour later I chop it heads up, £700 each. One of those nights you have to remember when things aren't going so well. Still the real point is when you do get lucky, take it to the hoop and that's what I managed to do. As I (in the style of Elvis) left the building there was some more apposite musical accompaniment to send me on my way. Phil Lynott in his pomp on the TV, spangly jacket, rocking guitars and "it's just that he gambles so much - and you know that it's wrong". Damn straight Phil. But he's not talking about me :-)

						   What's so great about going broke ? If there's one poker saying that I think is total bollocks it must be "all good players go broke sometimes". The hell they do. Bankroll management is an important skill for a truly good player - and so is digging in when things aren't going well.  Bankroll is a much misunderstood concept, as you can often see on the forums. If you're a recreational player on the side, a bankroll isn't a necessity. It's nice to have some money set aside to play poker out of, but if that goes you're not out on the streets. Like when you start out, you just set aside whatever you're comfortable with for poker, and do your best with it. I started with £50 a month, although to be fair there were regular £10 tournaments at the time. Meanwhile if you're a losing player, the concept of bankroll is simply irrelevant. It's only a matter of time before you lose it, however big it is.  A winning player who is dependent on poker income must have a bankroll and he must look after it. He must also not play too high for his bankroll and that's what almost everyone seems to do. Exactly how much you need depends on how well you play. However if you insist on playing £500 tournaments and £1K sit down cash games then I can assure you that you need a f*ckload of money to maintain an acceptably low risk of ruin. As Jesse May says in Shut Up and Deal "You really need a lot of money to play poker. A lot lot. So much that if you had it all you might as well not play any more, unless you got nothing else to do or are just out for blood money". I swear every time I read that book it rings more true.  There was a very brief, and very rude :-), post on the Mob forum last week which nonetheless contained a very salient point. The point being, there are lots of fish around in the small games and the small comps. So why are all these "faces" broke ? And why don't we see them grinding it up in the small games ?  The reason of course is but three letters long. E-G-O. If you keep playing in big games when your roll is running out, you're not a good player in my book. If you go broke, even less so. However many tricks you've got up your sleeve. However badly you would beat me up if we played heads up. I'm in action and you aren't. That means I'm better.

						   I must apologise for the month's hiatus (ooh) in the Diary.  But frankly not much has been happening, apart from QPR's irresistible surge towards Division Two glory.  On top of the lack of excitement, I read something in a book last week that really struck a chord.  It simply said "never complain, never explain".  Isn't that a great aphorism to take to the poker table ?  I do try not to complain but sometimes it gets the better of me ;  while explaining how clever I am to people is something I enjoy so much it's very hard not to.    Having said that, complaining and explaining is all I ever do on here.  Perhaps if I get it out of my system on the web then I can do the right thing at the tables !

						   During the break in a Stud tournament recently I was talking to someone who should probably remain anonymous :-) about why I played Stud much more than Hold-em.  When I mentioned that I preferred the people, on the whole, the answer was immediate "Ooh, I couldn't agree more.  Common as muck they are in those Hold-Em games !"  One of those things that I'm glad you said and not me, however it is as good a description as most.  For some reason small Hold-em games seem to have more than their share of miserable, small-minded, petty, rude people.  Common, if you like.  Go down to the Vic and you'll get it in spades.  Spending time in this company is very draining.  Very bad karma !  Once you start picking up bad habits it's time to ask whether it's worth it.

						   As I have said before, my play has been patchy for 18 months or so. One of the reasons is probably that I have simply been trying to do everything.  Trying to play big comps and small, cash games, on-line poker, trying to master it all !  Even within Hold-em tournaments, if you consider £20 comps, £100+ comps and on-line comps they are three completely different games !  One size does not fit all.  So while I have, for example, won £1000 in cash games over this period of time, my winnings in tournaments have dropped off by a lot more than that.  So today it is very liberating to be able to say, nuts to these :   Small B&M Hold-em tournaments.  First off the list.  I don't enjoy them anyway (see above)    UK Festivals.  Been there, failed to do it.  So many of these end up being chopped nowadays anyway.  12 ways in Brighton for God's sake !  Kudos for winning one of these is not what it was.  And quite right too, anyone can get lucky, even a few times.  While from a monetary point of view, facing up to so many of the best players is not good.   Dealers / Omaha / Hi-low B&M cash games.  Too hard !  You can find yourself playing against opponents with decades of experience in tough games.  I'd like it easier please.   On-line multi-table tournaments.  Take too long.  I doubt whether even a good online player (which isn't me) has a much higher expectation in a $50 multi-table comp compared to a $50 single table.  And the multi table takes anything from 4 times as long up.   On-line cash games.  I go on tilt too much :-)   Is there anything left ?  Well yes.   Small B&M Stud tournaments.  Fun to play in and, depending on the field size, more play than you might think.  The smaller the better in that respect.   B&M Stud cash game.  Happily of course, on the same night.  Luton has a very good stud cash game which I have a very good rate in on the rare occasions that I've played in it.  Even though there was a great deal I didn't know about it which [I think ...] I do now [not least buying in for the correct amount].   On-line single tables.  Despite my on-line travails I have managed to work out that I am about $700 up in these since day one.  8 or better games (omaha and stud) are particularly attractive.   US Festivals.  Now that's a holiday !  Knock British and European festivals into the shade for many reasons, which I'll probably cover later.  Reno in March sounds like a plan.  Then maybe even lig it up at the Series !!   So that's where you'll see me for the next few months. Playing games that I enjoy, that I make money in, and putting the hours in.  Or you won't see me :-).  Unless you're doing the same !

						   Just now I was having a flip through the channels to see if there was any football on at lunchtime. As it happens only Cardiff v Millwall, so not really. I came across Soccer AM which I have occasionally enjoyed in the past so I left it on for five minutes. They're doing the usual schtick when suddenly they announce "And now, it's a big day for her today but here she is, Michelle from Pop Idol". Enter a bloke in a wig and a comedy fat-suit, which falls off, to general hilarity.  If you want to know what TV does to our perceptions of others, here it is. I don't have any time for Pop Idol and the like myself, nonetheless I was quite encouraged to see that someone who doesn't look like a supermodel and was instead relying on her own talent was doing so well. And what does she get ? Two pretty-boy/girl presenters taking the piss in an embarrassing, playground, let's all point at the fat girl manner.  Lovejoy and Chamberlain (the presenters in question) aren't bad as presenters go. Nonetheless, if they weren't fortunate enough to look pretty like they do, I can tell you where they would be. Stacking shelves and doing Hospital Radio at weekends. Worst of all, right next to them on the sofa was Peter Beardsley, one of the most talented and committed footballers of his generation. I remember watching a game where Everton were 3-0 down having had 2 players sent off. Beardsley didn't give up, instead he upped his game and inspired his team-mates. They got it back to 3-2 before Rangers finally finished them off with a late goal. Here's this guy, basically a legend in football and someone for whom I have tremendous respect, a guy whose ability throughout his career usually took second billing to jokes about his appearance. While this performance was going on this morning, Beardsley laughed with everyone else and said nothing. Shame on you Peter.  TV sucks. Almost everyone on it (with the general exception of sportsmen and women) wouldn't be on there if they looked like you or me. It trivialises you, your life and everything it touches. And they have the nerve to call it "reality TV". I was going to watch Soccer Saturday this afternoon in my nice warm front room to check how my bet gets on. But fuck it. I'm going to watch Barnet instead. It's going to be cold and wet ; it's going to cost me £20 ; it's Conference football which is not the greatest ; and I'm going to have to get the bus because I'm not driving on the last Saturday before Xmas thank you. But it's going to be real, honest pros (like Danny Maddix, one of the best) doing their jobs to the best of their ability. And that'll do for me.  Footnote: I did go.  It was cold and wet.  Super Dan wasn't playing and Barnet lost 2-0.  My bet lost.  QPR lost.  But I still had a good time.  There was a particularly saucy female lineswoman running the line which was a new one on me.  It's the first time in 15 years of watching football I've heard someone say "do you think that lino's wearing a thong ?".  TV for sale.  Going cheap ...

						   During a debate about Crime and Punishment on the Mob Forum, Brad, who I have in the past had some sympathy for over the bashing he gets on there, suddenly went off on a wild tangent about how much information about us he would be happy to hand over to the state to protect us from crime. Basically everything by the sound of it.  It was most bizarre. Why do people think like this ? Why do people buy the Daily Mail for instance and believe all that crap ? Fear and paranoia. The media in this country have whipped up an unbelievable amount of hysteria over crime (likewise in the US over terrorism). Politicians are more than happy to go along with it as it allows them to justify outrageous extensions to their power and authority. Listen to me. You are extremely unlikely to be a victim of violent crime at the hands of a stranger. The vast majority of violent crimes are committed by someone known to the victim. Even, especially in fact, murder. You want to be safe ? Never mind locking all your doors and crossing the road when you see someone suspicious looking. Think more carefully about who you shack up with instead. The violations of our civil liberties being practised every day in the name of "fighting evil" are almost unbelievable. It is worse in the US with the "War against Terror" (see Michael Moore's latest book) but it's coming this way too, unless we open our eyes.

						   One thing Brad was right about was the technological capability to do all these things (like track everybody at any time). Technology is moving ahead in leaps and bounds, without a single thought as to the implications. This may be a scientific urban myth, however I have heard that when the first atomic test explosion was made, some of the scientists believed that there was a small chance (around 1 in 10,000) that a chain reaction would lead to the atomization of the entire atmosphere. But what the hell, they did it anyway.  There is no doubt that pretty soon you will be able to effectively implant a mobile phone in your head. Instant access to the internet, on-line libraries and such, wired straight into your brain. Marvellous. Just imagine the spam E-mails you get now being pumped straight into your cortex. Not for me thanks. There are all sorts of amazing things we could do though. Unless, of course, we do one of the following first :  - Blow ourselves to kingdom come with nuclear weapons. Pretty clever of us to wire up the whole planet to explode at the push of a button wasn't it ?  - Use up all the oil, causing mass starvation because we will no longer be able to produce enough food. This is actually only a matter of time.  - Create intelligent self-aware supercomputers which decide to destroy us, or enslave us if we're lucky. Bear with me here. This is nowhere near as fantastic as it may seem. To my mind the only truly far-fetched aspect of the Terminator films is that someone's going to travel back in time to save us. Once we get to the stage where computers design the next generation of computers, we basically won't know what the fuck is going on. And when these computers are controlling the nuclear weapons, because if we don't then the Russians/Chinese/Muslims will, game over.  So perhaps it would be best to live our lives to the full while we can. And what the hell, that's not a bad idea anyway is it ? So while everything I say below about playing in the right games and avoiding big tournaments is good advice for anyone trying to make a living from the game, thankfully I'm not. So maybe I will be playing some more festivals. It's a hell of a buzz when you get some chips. We start off broke and we die broke, everything else is fluctuation. Might as well have some fun.

						   I made a bit of a mistake this week - for some reason I had been posting a bit more on various forums until I made the singular mistake of saying something that people don't want to hear. Namely that the high proportion of online qualifiers in the Poker Million would mean that the show would not be as exciting or entertaining as for example the WPT.  I stand by what I said, although I have no intention of posting any further on the topic. Dave Colclough made an opposing argument but felt it was necessary to call me "stupid". Fair enough, I'm a big boy, but I lost respect for him because there was no need to be personal. Another poster offered the old schoolyard "well I'll fight you then" by challenging me to outlast him online or something - goodbye.  Incidentally this challenge was laid down 2 hours after Dave's post - but 4 days after mine.  Which I thought was interesting.   Anyway, both missed my point. No doubt some very good players will qualify on-line and everyone has a chance in a very fast structure, as we saw last time. My point is that many people will qualify on-line through free-rolls and satellites who have never played for anything like that kind of money. If 30 people qualify online I guarantee at least 10 of them will be rabbits in the headlights once £40K is on the table. 10 more will be very, very nervous. Having one player at a table who's out of his depth is one thing - having two or three players, six-handed, is going to remove a lot of the tension and the interest in my book.  Funnily enough the latest WPT episode illustrated this quite nicely.  Albeit this was Limit Hold-em, in the final we had 2 pros (both top players) and 4 on-line qualifiers.  Of the on-line crew, one wasn't too bad and finished third.  One woman I'm sure was thinking of nothing apart from how good her own hand was.  One guy didn't play a hand and got anted away.  And one kid who fancied himself as the new generation of poker and could see lots of mistakes the professionals were making.  He got ironed out in 5 minutes (in Limit Hold-em !).  Quite entertaining in its way but, even though these players made it through huge fields on-line and the WPT event itself, it wasn't great poker until Jett and Lederer were heads up.  The strength of the WPT is that most weeks there's maybe one player at most who made it through satellites (whether on-line or B+M) and the rest are tough pros who are used to these stakes.  By the way, the money factor didn't apply last time (and won't again) to the snooker players. These guys have played snooker, a game with a wafer-thin margin of error, for huge amounts of money in front of huge audiences for many years. They weren't fazed at all and they were also helped by some poor play from professionals who should have known better (see "New World Poker Champion, 18/7/03 below).  Sure anyone can win the Poker Million.  But that's not my point.  If Sky are still happy with their audiences when heats 10 and 11 come round I will stand corrected. Until then, we shall see. And if you don't agree, you can call me what you like. Cos there's no right of reply on here :-)  [9/7/04 Note : actually now there is :-)]

						   The very keen amongst you may have noticed that I have snipped out a paragraph from the “Get it quietly” piece below.  This was the bit where, in a fit of pique, I forswore the festival circuit forever, pretty much.  Given time to reflect I have reconsidered.  That’s another great thing about having your own diary compared to posting on forums – not only is there no right of reply, you can change your mind and take stuff back as well :-).   That’s not to say I’m going to sell all my stuff and hit the road to Paris with all my money in a plastic bag.  If you either have a big win and are happy to play with the profit, or just basically don’t care about the money, play the festival circuit as much as you like.  If not, it’s much better to take the odd shot than to make a habit of playing tournaments for £200 and more.  Even the best player will catch a very expensive downswing sooner or later (see  urlLink Simon Trumper's article ).  Personally I don’t have a problem with putting £300 into a tournament, but I do have a problem with putting £300 into tournaments with 130 runners, 20 of whom are a bit too good.  Especially on a regular basis.   What I figure is that if I get my head down for 6 months, festivals won’t go away in the meantime.  If I pick the right games, make the right decisions and enjoy playing just for the sake of it then winning will take care of itself.  Just like on the Internet, where I won’t be happy until I get my £1000 back, I won’t really be comfortable until I rebuild my bankroll to what it was 2 years ago.  I could just take the difference from what I made on my flat – but I think that if I work to get it back over time then I’ll appreciate it more and take better care of it.  Time, as ever, will tell.

						   Pot-limit Omaha Hi-lo.  In the tournaments I have described below, the super-satellites and the speed tournaments, you shouldn’t be playing a lot of “poker”.  By which I mean calling pre-flop, gauging the strength of your opponent’s hand, estimating the chances a bluff will succeed, all that rubbish :-).  When you have a decent stack, you’re trying to get paid with a big hand ;  when you’re short, it’s either pass or move in and let the other guy sweat.  In fact, you are taking advantage of other players’ trying to play too much poker (that is any at all in the speed tournaments especially).  Profitable maybe, but not so much fun.   It would be nice to play in some tournaments where we can take some flops and outplay our opponents.  Well, all you have to do is play a different game.  Instead of trying to play poker in a format which isn’t conducive, switch to Pot-limit Omaha Hi-Lo instead.  In this game you are trying to commit pre-flop as little as you possibly can.  Hands run quite close “hot and cold” when all the money is in pre-flop, but playing the wrong kind of hand will kill you when there is betting on the later streets.  Opportunities to freeroll, three-quarter or completely smother your opponents will come if you wait for the right hands.  Playing short-stacked is ok too, if you pick the right hands and make sure you’re raising to limit the field you won’t get scooped very often.   I was going to give a few tips here but coaches in the car park.  Good advice can be found elsewhere, even via my own Links page.  A little thought about exactly what you are trying to achieve with a hand will go a long way.  Oh alright then, just one, don’t put all your money in trying to get it back plus half the blinds :-).

						   One topic I’ve noticed on the forums more and more lately is people touting themselves around for backers.  Can’t blame them for trying but the only answer I can give is short and sharp : “Yeah I bet you’d rather play with my money than your own.  Ain’t gonna happen though !”

						   There are certain phrases in poker which become even better when one particular person says them.  Of course, no one says “you’ll be alright” quite like Francis.  No one says “different gear” like Action Dave.  And no one says “get it quietly” like Dr. Channing.  I was knocked out twice in Luton this week when I could have used the sepulchral tones of the good doctor to effect.   I don’t want this to sound like bad beat stories, but anyway, on Monday I have the overpair, he has the flush draw, its all in on the flop and he makes it on the river.  Cue clenched fist and shout of “Yes !”.  On Wednesday it goes all in pre-flop with AKs (me), AJs and QQ.  AJ, who believe me has no business putting a single chip in this pot, defies the odds to make his flush and treble up.  As I am nursing the 300 I have won in the side pot he sits there with a face like a smacked arse and goes “Urrgh that’s the first pot I’ve won all evening”.   Now neither of these qualifies as a full rubdown and I fully admit that when little things like this get under your skin it shows you’re not in the right frame of mind to play.  Monday was the KO anyway and when I lost the 300 on Wednesday I upped and left even though rebuys were still going.  But what happened on Wednesday put Monday into perspective.  The guy was excited and happy he won the pot, and good luck to him.  When someone puts his money in almost stone dead, trebles up and is still fxcking miserable it makes you wonder why he’s there at all.  It certainly wasn’t to make money, based on his play up to that point.

						   The need for speed !  Given that my satellite / small (as in few runners) tournament plan is looking good for now, it might be fair to say that speed tournaments are more for fun than major profit.  Nonetheless, especially if you don’t want to put a lot of money online, the speed tournaments on Poker In Europe are well worth looking at.   At first sight they shouldn’t really be any value at all.  The blinds go up every 3 (three) minutes.  However, a huge proportion of the players have no idea how to play a short stack.  After 15 minutes in one of these, you’re usually on a short stack.  After half an hour, everybody’s on a short stack.  The mistakes people make at this point generally boil down to trying to play poker.  No.  Not here.  You get it all in hard and you get it all in first.  Take up the right attitude and become completely fearless !  Don’t sweat running into a hand or being outdrawn, just do it, and you will get caked up much more often than you would think.  After all even if it goes pear-shaped on the bubble it was still only 45 minutes.   There is a parallel with the later stages of conventional tournaments when the blinds get high.  If everyone knows what they’re doing then luck will decide the outcome.  However I could say that about any stage of a tournament.  When everyone doesn’t know how to play a short stack, when you can exploit their fear and play without fear yourself, you’ve got more of an edge than you might think.  Get some practice in online and next time you can turn down that deal and watch them sweat.

						   Super-satellites.  Having rubbished super-satellites, Hold-em and Internet tournaments below it does seem strange that the combination of all three proves a winner.  Or I could just have been talking rubbish, that’s not so strange at all.  Anyway the great thing about super-satellites is that you don’t have to finish in the top three.  In fact if you do, you’ve almost certainly played it wrong and incurred too much risk.   On Pokerstars they have regular $36 multi-table satellites for their $200 NL thrashfest.   Just recently though they have introduced the concept of “tournament dollars”.  This means that if you win a seat, you can unregister and get $215 in Tournament Dollars instead.  You can use this to enter any tournament or sit and go, and anything you win you get in cash.   I’ve haven’t played many of these yet but I think that it is feasible to win the seat at least 1/3 of the time, possibly more.  That’s a profit of $33 in an average of about 1 ½ hours, or $20 an hour.  In terms of hourly rate that’s miles better than anything I could (or think I could) manage before, and with lower variance.  Plus the satellite itself takes up very little bandwidth, seeing as, while you aren’t short-stacked, correct play ranges from tight to very tight to click sit out and go down the pub.   Of course the problem is that you are winning tournament dollars, not money.  You still have to take some time to convert these into real $.  But while, as I said, it’s not easy to make money in Internet tournaments, it’s easy enough to break even.  Sit and Goes are probably the best bet for converting into money in the shortest time.   So that’s the plan for a while, play as many of these as I can, use them for tournaments (often simultaneously) and basically get my £1000 back.  I know that isn’t necessary logical but, contrary to popular belief, I’m not a robot and I want my £1000 back :-).  If I get there I might do the same thing and freeroll in bigger tournaments with the profit, giving myself a chance of getting lucky and winning a decent score.  Might as well while I’m at home, it beats watching TV.   Stop Press : after writing this piece this morning, I tried to convert some tournament dollars in a $50 No-Limit comp and I accidentally finished second for $750.  How did that happen ?

						   It’s only natural for people to want to talk about things that are going well, and not about less successful ventures.  I think this means that a very false picture can be painted of the “festival” scene.  You see the winners in Poker Europa, people talk about their wins on the forums and their websites, but how often do you hear about the losses ?   Well I am as guilty as anyone, after all I have posted a big trip report about the time I won £10K in the Vic (almost three years ago).  To redress the balance, I’m going to talk about what’s happened since then.  The hard facts are that since that win I have played 58 £100+ tournaments in the UK without one top three finish.  During this run I have lost £12,600.  Add another £1000 for satellites and £3000 for an abortive trip to Vienna in 2002 and that’s a lot of money don’t you think ?   Of course if I hadn’t won the 10K then I wouldn’t have played so much (particularly at £250 and £500).  The total figures since day one for UK £100+ tournaments are played 74, lost £4,400.  That’s £60 a throw which probably isn’t too bad considering I had some fun and excitement and learned a great deal.     I know I’m not the best player in these tournaments but I’m sure as hell not the worst.  By a long way.  I think I’m a lot better player than I was 3 years ago but it’s hard to be sure in this game, damn hard.  The real point is that because I’ve been making in the small games and more importantly because I have a job this £16K downswing hasn’t killed me.  If you want to play poker for a living, these tournaments will break you sooner or later, no doubt.  Especially if when you do win, you blow half of it.   As for me thanks to my records I was able to keep good track of this, and in fact I only played 8 £100+ tournaments last year.  I am playing Luton this week (for £100 and £150), but just to take a shot.  The money, £1500 or so, is put aside and considered gone.  If I get a result I might spin it up throughout the year, if not I’ll forget about it for a while.  If you want to play at this level, it’s up to you.  But I can assure you that one of the easiest ways of going broke is to spin up your small-tournament profits in the festivals, miss out, then hit a downswing in the regular comps and end up with nothing.  Happens all the time.  Be aware.

						   I have been playing on the Internet for a couple of years, mostly tournaments, mostly breaking even.  I am about £1000 down, mainly due to a brief spell of trying $100/$200 comps and some poor cash play.  In a nutshell it is not easy to make significant, consistent money in Internet tournaments, especially playing the most common form, NL Hold-em.  I have detailed the difficulties with HE tournaments below.  On the Internet there is an additional problem which is that there are so many runners.  While 10% of the field gets paid, sneaking in the money (B&M and online) tends to minimise your losses or at best keep you afloat.  You make your profit by finishing top three, and preferably winning.  When your tournaments have anything from 100 runners up, you can go a long long time in between making the big scores you need.  By the way the same argument applies to playing festival tournaments on a regular basis.   However I am on an upturn online recently, having cleared $500 this week.  Of course I had some luck along the way, but I’m now much more sure that I am playing in games which have significant positive expectation.  These games are : super-satellites, speed tournaments and Omaha Hi-Lo.  As I have the week off I will (probably – no promises) post a little bit about each one and why it’s more profitable than a standard Internet NL tournament.  Without giving away too many secrets – coaches in the car part after all :-)

						   Another month, another issue of Poker Europa.  Well, I haven’t seen the latest issue yet but I have read this on the Internet :    urlLink Ban Sunglasses   And what utter nonsense it is.  On a par with the issue of taking drugs in athletics my arse.  The problem with performance enhancing drugs is that they are extraordinarily bad for you in the long term.  Florence Griffith-Joyner for example (Flo-Jo as you may remember her) dropped dead before she reached 40.  If drugs were allowed (as some people propose), you would have to say to teenage athletes “well son, you’ve got all the talent in the world but if you want to win anything you’re going to have to shorten your life by 30 years”.  And that’s why they’re not allowed.  To compare that with perching sunglasses on your nose in a vain attempt to make yourself unreadable you would have to be either six years old or insane or both.   There’s a lot else I don’t like about that article which mostly boils down to TV saying “jump” and poker being expected to say “how high” instead of what it should say – either “no you go and jump” or “only if you give us lots of money”.  But although this article is stupid, it’s not actually insulting (except to our intelligence).  There have been other instances where Poker Europa has, I think, stepped over the line.  When pressed on this, Nic Szeremata and the poker operators for whose benefit the magazine is published fall back on three arguments : it’s free ;  it was just a joke ;  and it’s someone’s opinion not mine.  It’s hard to decide which of these defences is the lamest.  I’d have more respect for them if they just said “so what” rather than coming out with these piss-poor excuses.   It’s not all bad.  Nothing’s all good or bad in the end.  I am told there is an excellent piece in the latest issue by Simon Trumper which talks about the downside of playing the tournament circuit.  And they printed a review of my software for which I was, and still am, very grateful.  But it could be a lot better if the publishers took a bit more responsibility for the quality of what they print, and for the effect it might have on the game.  Just someone’s opinion – mine !

						   Over Christmas I had a good 2 ½ weeks off work to large it, catch up with some sleep and play some poker.  The best laid plans of mice though … my car was off the road and I couldn’t get it fixed until the New Year.  So I ended up playing a bit online and that was mostly it.  Given some time to think instead of just play, play, play it finally dawned on me that I have been playing Hold-em like a twat for at least the past year.   What I was doing was playing a short-stack strategy that was based on the assumption that my all-ins would only get called by sensible hands like 99, AT and better.  In real life that’s not what happens though is it ?  This was finally brought home to me when I went all in with QJ in early position only to find the small blind going into a dwell-up and then calling for 2/3 of his chips with A4.  And that was in a £100 comp !   If someone wants to make this move with A4 it’s his money (for the moment).  If they are going to though, then my assumptions are way off the mark.  And if your assumptions are wrong, your whole strategy can go in the bin.  So, given some time to work some things out on my computer, I have developed a completely different short-stack strategy which feels a lot, lot better.   It feels better on-line, even in satellites.  Especially in satellites.  Pokerstars have a cool deal which I have only recently noticed.  If you win a $200 seat in one of their multi-table sats, you don’t have to play the million runner up till 6 am on a Monday morning slugfest, you can get tournament dollars and play, for example, four $50 comps instead.  So after rubbishing Internet multi-table comps and super-satellites generally for six months, when I actually play them they’re looking nicely profitable.    It also feels better in live tournaments.  Cut off from Luton , I have played a couple of No-Limit tournaments in the Vic instead.  And contrary to what I said below, these play exactly like Internet tournaments.  People check-raising with hopeless hands because “I thought you had AK”.  People losing half their chips and promptly shoving the rest in on the next hand out of sheer tilt.  People calling big reraises with AT and saying “I know you’re winning” as they move the chips in.   So forget everything I said (if you haven’t already).  I’m going to give a few Hold-em comps a spin.  Especially the Luton festival in a couple of weeks, three juicy looking £100/£150 tournaments.  I’ll let you know how it goes !

						   Apparently Ladbrokes have now "clarified" the Poker Million structure.  There won't be any "best runners up" making the semi finals because this would "encourage collusion".  Hmmm.  Could it in fact be that some bright spark in marketing thought that "best runners up" would be a good idea until three months later someone who actually knows something about poker tournaments pointed out that it is impossible to define a "best" runner up ?  Plus the revised semi-final structure looks wide open to collusion to me, but what do I care.   I have though finally figured out what really bugs me about this competition.  It's not open.  Most poker tournaments are totally democratic.  Is there any other sport in the world where you can turn up for the showpiece event, the World Cup, the Olympics and the Masters rolled into one, plonk your money down and play ?  None that counts I reckon !  And that's the great thing about it.  The World Series is open.  The first Poker Million (which John Duthie won in such style) was open.  The WPT is open - anyone who rolls up to a WPT event with $5K or $10K as required is in.  Of course you have to make the last 6 to get your mush on TV in each of those but that's fair enough.   Even the previous Poker "Million" (how do they get away with that ?) was kind of open, at least until the 36 seats were snapped up.  This isn't.  Don't start off about satellites on the Internet either.  I played in one of these for a laugh.  Just because it would be so funny to qualify :-).  But I didn't.  No surprise there because there was 1 seat for each 100 runners.  Not 10 (as is the norm, more or less) but 100.  So nuts to it.  Don't forget that the prime beneficiary of this competition is Ladbrokes, by a mile.  Coming up a strong second is Barry Hearn, and in the far distance bringing up the rear, poker players.  I'm not going to say I hope it dies on its arse audience wise, because in the end that wouldn't be good for poker.  But it doesn't matter that much one way or the other, and I honestly, independently believe that it is very likely to do just that.

						   Or really that should be "win and moan".  OK, poker players like a moan.  Bad beat stories have a lure that is hard to resist, when you're the teller.  I try my level best not to do it but even so the odd one slips out now and then.  What I can't stand is people doing it when they're winning (and I'm losing !).   Vince Burgio mentioned it on Poker Pages recently which is what reminded me.  There is little worse than making your way to the rail on your tournament exit and being stopped to have your ear bent by a bad beat story - from someone who's still in !  Luton of course have some world champion moaners.  Every now and then you'll see one of them get lucky, win hand after hand, and look more and more uncomfortable as they stack more and more chips.  Now what can they do ?  This doesn't stop the real champions.  This won't last, don't give me any more hands will you - then they give back one of the 20 orange chips in front of them and off they go.  In essence, shut the f*ck up moaning WHEN YOU'RE WINNING.   My favourite instance of this, although I wasn't amused at the time, is a Stud comp where I find the Aces, reraise all in, Queens call the reraise and win.  Fair enough.  I'm making my way off, minding my own business, but as this guy is raking in the chips he's going "bloody Queens when I get them someone's always got Aces".  I could have cracked open his head and feasted on his very brains.  If I could have found them.

						   I think I knew it all along really.  There’s a lot of talk on here almost since I started this diary about not being sure which games I should be playing, not having a clear plan and so on.  The fact of the matter is I’m just not as motivated to play poker as I was 3 or 4 years ago.    There are various reasons for this.  I’ve never felt quite the same about the game since I went to Vienna in 2002 and dropped £3000 (plus £1000 expenses) in 10 days.  Before that, the sky was the limit – I thought I’d just keep winning and winning.  Also I had ambitions/delusions (delete as applicable) of becoming a tournament circuit “face”.  A 4 grand hit was hard to swallow, even though I had won more than that in the previous 4 months.  Too hard.  If you want to play at that kind of level you have to be able to deal with swings much bigger than that, and I can’t.   On top of that I sold my flat last summer, and am now renting.  A two bedroom flat in London which I bought 3 years previously – you do the math as our American friends like to say.  So I don’t need to win at poker to afford luxury items ;  I don’t need to win at poker just so I can lose it all in a week playing above my level ;  and I don’t need to win at poker just to prove to myself I can do it.   None of these are bad things.  They are good !  It’s almost a liberation.  I was spending too much time on it.  I’ll have time to play all the poker I want when I’m old and society has gone to hell in a handbasket.  As of the now I’m happy to play socially when I’m meeting someone or going with someone ;  on a “poker holiday” in the states as I am next month – with a friend, we’re going to clean them out ! ;  and on the Internet at home, pop on some music, play what I like when I like how I like for as long as I like.  I can do all this without schlepping up the M1 to listen to the George Kiss Comedy Hour, make one interesting decision every 90 minutes, lose on a 50-50, get the rub down in 6-card Omaha Hi Lo and then schlep all the way back again.   So I’ll still be around – but poker will be a hobby not the hobby and I feel so much better about that.  And I wonder if I’m the only one.  It’s generally quiet in Luton this time of year (why they have consecutive festivals in December and January is beyond me) but it’s almost comatose lately.  Thursday night is done, you can stick a fork in it.  Saturday is going the same way.  I wonder if people come from the Internet to live poker, don’t like it, and go back.  While one by one they (we !) drift out of the cardrooms and into cyberspace.  Where no one can hear you scream !

						   Let me start off by telling you my favourite cricket anecdote (and this is absolutely true).  Durham CC are in an Italian restaurant placing their orders. Ian Botham, holding court as usual, announces "and I'll have some of that cheese - dolecetti". Simon Hughes says "no, that's dolcelatti". Botham "That's what I said, dolecetti". Hughes "No Both, it's dolcelatti".  At this point Botham throws the menu onto the table, leans forward, glares at Hughes menacingly and says "Oh yeah ? And how many f**king test wickets have you got then ?"  This is an extreme example but it demonstrates the point I'm trying to make. It doesn't matter who you are, what you say either stands or falls on its own merit. On an Internet forum, it doesn't matter if someone posts under their full name, address, email, picture and details of where to find them or whether they post under Ebenezer Joe McNulty IV, Emperor of the Moon. What they say is either right or wrong, fair or unfair, valid or invalid. You only need to know who someone is if you want to suck up to them or attack them. I have been guilty of being overly sensitive about anonymous posts in the past. This was wrong. I think there's nothing wrong with posting anonymously, and a lot of the time if you're anonymous then that precludes people from attacking you rather than addressing the issues (although some still try, which can be very amusing watching them swing wild haymakers like a blind drunk in a barroom brawl).  I know people who have innumerable forum aliases, and why not. On a forum it's what you say, not who you are (and in real life it's what you do). So in an open appeal to the Hendon Mob (or their moderator), don't enforce registration - you'll kill the forum dead if you do.  PS A free licence for the first person who can place the quote "Anonymity is a virtue in this day and age" !  [9/7/04 Note : no one did.

						   Well I made it back in one piece from Reno, without maximum bankroll damage thanks to having 10% of my much more successful travelling partner. Last time I said "system working well send more money", but this time I'm not so sure. I think I have sussed out what I was doing wrong for most of the week, which is of course a good thing !  I was playing too tight. What this meant was that I was missing out on getting chips off the poor players before they knocked themselves out. On top of that when I did find a hand I wasn't getting any action from the more aware opponents. So with about two days left I decided nuts to this * and started playing some marginal hands and making judgement plays. Needless to say I got some of these wrong, but more of them right, and it felt a lot better. If nothing else it was more fun and stopped me from getting bored.  One point that struck me out there was how poorly the majority of American players handle a short stack.  I lost count of the number of players I saw call off their last chips with a hand that could not possibly be winning (22, A8, KJ all that rubbish), and that includes several who otherwise played very well. The most frustrating experience of the whole trip for me was watching a woman call all-in three-way with A5, win the sidepot, call those off with J5, win that, then go on to knock me out and, as it transpired the next day, win the tournament. Marvellous. In fact (whether by luck or judgement) once she got some chips she played reasonably well, albeit in a calling station stylee, but that's the other thing over there - there are a lot of players who just can't stop bluffing. Two checks, or a pre-flop limp and a check, are just a red rag to them. Two days later I watched Bonetti try to bluff the same woman only for her to call all the way with a Jack high flush draw and pair up on the river. This is a guy with a big reputation over there, a guy who finished third in the World Series, who doesn't seem to have grasped that you can't bluff a mug. A guy who I trapped like a rat half an hour later only for him to hit his 3-outer. A face is a face, the world over :-).  * I'm still in American non-swearing mode. If I said what I meant there, I would have to take a 20-minute break from the keyboard. The land of the free my behind (see I'm still doing it).

						   I see that while I was away there was another "Celebrity Poker" thread on the Mob Forum. It's probably a good job I wasn't here or I would have incurred the wrath of Miss Vicky by suggesting, as a colleague did, that Roger de Courcey and Nookie Bear are less than worthy of our star-struck adulation. I am tempted to write to the Observer and suggest that, while Vicky is an excellent writer, we the British public would rather see celebrities doing things badly than professionals doing things right, and so can she please be replaced by Stu "I Could Crush a Grape" Francis ?  Nonetheless it would be remiss of me not to report on which US celebrities allowed us to bask in their radiance last week. Allegedly Prince was staying in the hotel and even played a little bit of poker, although I didn't see him. Mind you he could have been across the table in Seat 9 for all I knew as he probably wouldn't be tall enough to see over the rail. Much more believably, I met the 2002 World Shuffleboard Champion who regaled us with the thrilling tale of how he overcame a wrist injury by throwing left-handed to claim the title. "You gotta be able to play with both hands at that level" - so now you know. And we saw Preppie from "Saved by the Bell" who very thoughtfully wore a T-shirt with a picture of his character on it and the word PREPPIE underneath. If only more D-list celebs would follow this example, I for one would find it a lot easier.

						   A quick follow up to my piece last week about referring to yourself in the third person (by the way Alan Shearer is another one who often mentions Alan Shearer when talking about Alan Shearer).  I've been reading Mark Steel's "Reasons to be Cheerful". It's excellent (as is his book on the French Revolution) and I can think of several people who would benefit from reading it even though they'll disagree with almost everything he says (go on David you might enjoy it).  Anyway quite late on in the book he meets Arthur Scargill. While struck by his passion, Steel notes that "Strangest of all was his habit of referring to himself in the third person. So I stood there, trying to nod in agreement, as Scargill yelled 'What did Arthur Scargill do when the pension fund was threatened ? I'll tell you what Arthur Scargill did. Arthur Scargill ...'. Afterwards Mark Thomas, who was standing nearby, suggested that I should have said 'This Arthur Scargill bloke sounds brilliant. I'm going to go and talk to him because you're a w@nker mate'"  Which goes to show that I have a point, I just can't express it as well as professional comedians. Never mind. If only someone would say that to Shearer.

						   I'm still here there's just not much for me to report ! I'm grinding away on the Internet, I will do for a few months, and then see where we are. As I said a couple of months ago, making money in poker is simply about finding a game you can beat, putting the hours in, and repeating. Boring but there it is.  I have wiped off my £1000 loss on the net and am back in black which is nice !

						   As I said, the latest show was instructive. One lesson for us all is to never, ever, ever refer to yourself in the third person on TV. I know Guy Bowles, he's alright and not an arrogant person at all. But right now he must be wishing he had never said, on camera, "The Iceman doesn't tilt". It made him sound like a complete knob, even before some clever-clogs in Sky spliced it in just before he called the Devilfish's raise out of position with T9. Looked like a tilt play to me Guy :-). Because tilt doesn't necessarily mean calling all your chips when the red mist comes down, Feeney defines tilt as "any adverse impact of emotion on your play". By those standards, I do it, you do it, everyone does it, sometimes. Better to realise that than try to deny it.

						   So I'd better find something else to talk about. Seeing as the latest episode of the Poker "Million" may be the only one that backs up the points I made earlier, let's go with that. The Devilfish gave an absolute masterclass on Friday in how to play when you're the best player. Keep the pots small and don't give anyone a chance to get lucky. Instructive in its way but not exactly dramatic, and precisely what I feared when I looked at the overall line-up. We shall see how the rest of it goes.

						   Once again though I was struck by the excellent composure shown by the "sportsman" player. As the Devilfish pointed out, anyone who "takes a penalty shot for England" isn't going to be too fazed by a game of poker (we know what he meant :-)). Once he settled in, Sheringham handled himself better than the rest and might have had a reasonable shot if he hadn't made some understandable technical mistakes through inexperience. If a real player had sat him down beforehand for even an hour and just gone through some tournament basics, he would have had a chance. Now this is a long shot, but if any sportsmen who fancy a shot at the tournament circuit would like some advice, let me know ! It'll cost but you'll get it back many times over. Discount if you play for QPR. No doubt some wag will send me an Email from "Clark Carlisle" any day now :-)

						   Finally for today a window into my world. This is going to be hard for most poker players to identify with, but this morning I was in a "Body Pump" fitness class when I realised that there was something familiar about the instructor's patter. After ten minutes of worrying over it I finally realised she was going "Aaaaaa" just like Action Dave. If she had said "Feel the Pain Aaaaaaa" it could have been him right there. So this is my world. I must be the only person anywhere who can be in a fitness class thinking "this instructor sounds just like a poker player I know". I scare myself sometimes.

						   Made it back from Vegas in one piece last night, and while that obviously means I didn't make it into the biggest poker tournament in the history of the world ever, until the next one, I still made a few hundred dollars on the poker and had a really good time.  The Series is different gravy !  Book me in for two weeks next year !  Diary updates to follow, probably after the dust has settled on the main event, and don't worry, there are plenty of other diaries around till then.  At one point I chopped a single table satellite three ways with Samuel Pepys and Adrian Mole (ching !  thanks to Bad Beat for that one).  So stay tuned to hear about the five armadillos, the rabid football hooligans, the Nippers Express and the soon to be world famous DY-Hellmuth confrontation.  In the mean time it was so mad on Friday I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to a lot of people so thanks to everyone who was so friendly, good luck to those in the main event, and particular thanks to Keith for pitching the trip to me in the Springbok and convincing me to fly out - cheers mate !

						   We are QPR say we are QPR !  Rangers are back in Division One !  Being Rangers we had to make it difficult but I am told we were excellent on the day and we certainly played with more all-round commitment than I have ever seen in the last home game against Swindon.  So well deserved all round.  And you know what ?  I think I deserve a holiday.  And so without further ado I am off to Vegas on Friday.  Mostly to hang around the rail, but I will chance my arm in a few satellites and second chance comps just to see what happens.  I hereby swear to not wuss out and play like a rock ;  to play Aggressive Non-Believer to the hilt ;  and to enjoy myself whatever happens.  That way I can't lose !  It'll be good to let my hair down for a week.  Ice cream for dessert !  Only 10 sit-ups in the morning !!  Playing satellites without carefully ascertaining the structure and its implications on play !!!  It's going to be a wild time.  (only joking about the last one of course)  So if you see a chav in a blue and white hooped shirt hanging around Binions, come up and say hello !

						   ... and As for apologies.  Sorry about the lack of diary updates lately !  Various reasons, as detailed below.  Mainly I have been posting more often on the Hendon Mob forum.  I must thank people who have said nice things about the diary and my posts - that encourages me to post more often - so you can blame them for the lack of diary entries !  I expect someone will annoy me enough that I go off and sulk and stop posting soon though, that's what usually happens !  In the meantime every man and his dog is now posting up WSOP diaries.  Every sponsored man anyway - when you take the shilling you do have to jump when they click their fingers !  Most are thrilling accounts of how the hero took 7 hours to lose someone else's money.  Barny's quite entertaining though, and Colclough's not bad, but the real nuts is Jesse May on www.thegoodgamblingguide.com .   This is a) because he can write (you have to read Shut Up and Deal) and b) because he's not playing.  Do check it out, it gives you a real feeling for the atmosphere.

						   Jesse even finds time to name check the finest football team the world has ever seen (see Day 9).  Today QPR are all-in on the bubble, waiting for the flop to be dealt.  A win at monstrous under-achievers Sheffield Wednesday would seal promotion to Division One.  Now, I know it's a bad idea to make a large emotional investment in something you can't control, but I've kind of got caught up in it this season.  I will be gutted for the team if they don't go up, it has been incredibly hard work, but if we don't we can't make excuses, we just haven't won enough games away from home.  But if we do it's going to feel great.  Don't even want to think about it yet but it will be a massive release of tension !

						   One of the more interesting debates on the forum lately was also football related.  "Bigot Ron" (as the Sun called him - like they can talk !) was in the dock for making some rather unpleasant comments about Chelsea's Marcel Desailly.  Despite setting his stall out with a heartfelt "some of my best friends are black" defence early doors, Ron was well and truly reduced, leaving the field himself without waiting for the curly finger.  So next season someone else will be mangling the English language on ITV every other Wednesday night.   Now, political correctness was a bit nuts (although I suspect that the more extreme examples were made up by the papers) but don't forget that in the 70s family entertainment like "Love Thy Neighbour" and "Mind Your Language" was prime-time. Incidentally the same writer was responsible for both, which begs the question, why did no one kill him ?  Love Thy Neighbour was before my time, but Mind Your Language I remember all too well. It was set in an English as a Foreign Language class where the plucky teacher tried to maintain order in his class of national stereotypes - the pretentious Frenchman, the humourless German, the lecherous Italian, the promiscuous Dutch girl, etc. Basically it made 'Allo 'Allo look like 'Amlet *. To give you an idea how bad it was, it's never been on UK Gold.  So now we have people being removed from their jobs for a careless word when they thought no one was listening, but we don't have Mind Your Language on TV. Make your own judgement. I would have thought Ron would have been a bit more careful mind you, as a few months ago his half time off-air comments were broadcast to most of Europe. In between asking for more sandwiches he mused "I'll tell you what, he's a little tw@t that Totti".  * I freely admit that the whole raison d'etre of this piece was to do that line.

						   ... the other day one of them completely conned me.  That's the entire text of one of my favourite ever letters in Viz.  Poker has its share of dodgy dealers, and every now and then the finger is pointed.  I'm not going to say anything about individual cases but what really makes me laugh is when people pop up with the defence "how can you say that, he's a really nice guy".  Earth to stupid people - how successful do you think an unfriendly conman would be ?  Conmen are nice to people because that helps when it comes to conning them.  Duh !

						   OK this is my last word on the Poker Million.  Most people seem to have seen through this junk by now anyway.  I'm not really interested in any of the players left in so they can get on with it.  Just one, in the style of Columbo, just one more thing.  What's with these players who qualify online and turn up to play three months later having still never played a live tournament ?    It's like showing up for your driving test, knocking over four pedestrians and then saying "Well I thought I did OK seeing as I've never actually driven a car before".

						   I'm not a great one for watching poker ;  I have to do enough of it in between folding hands.  If I can't see any cards at all I'd usually rather watch paint dry.  It's just not a spectator sport.  Unless ... you can get some audience participation going !  The $3,000 Pot Limit Hold-em final brought together Phil Hellmuth, Ram Vaswani and Garry Bush.  This proved to be very entertaining viewing for a couple of hours, although I have to admit that most of the time we were making our own entertainment.  A section of about a dozen English players, on and off, was later described as "rabid" in an official report.  The beers were starting to flow and the ESPN guys were giving us a nod and a wink any time they could, they loved it !  Every time Bushy scooped a pot the cries of "Go on the Whacker !" were a little louder.  Even Matt Savage (who is a top guy by the way) announced him as "The Whacker" at one point.  Highlights included The Camel calling rather loudly for a club on the river which duly arrived to cripple Hellmuth, who shot a fierce look or two in our direction on his exit - it probably didn't help that Dave Colclough was sitting right in the middle grinning back at him :-).  Bushy picking up Aces after Ram reraising with Kings - and giving just the slightest little slow roll, you had to look hard to see it, but Ram saw it :-).  And after I left the stands to play the second chance, a fine rendition of "Swing Low Sweet Chariot" which was led by, of all people, Professor Jeff Duvall.  It's always the quiet ones you have to watch.

						   Of course when word got back to the Vic that Bushy had picked up 130 large, the nippers sprang into action.  Off they went to Heathrow to hide in packing crates, clutch onto wings and fly their own bicycle-propelled aircraft like those films where they all jump off the pier and get about 3 yards.  Customs was no problem at all.  If you go through customs and say something like "Well I'm on holiday mostly but I might play a bit of poker", they say "oh yeah do you know the Devilfish ?", you lie and say "Yes" and you're through no more questions (this is true BTW).  When the nippers got there it was "well I'm on holiday mostly but I might do a bit of nipping" - "Oh yeah do you know Willy Tann" - "Yes I do" - "OK sir have a nice trip" - "Cheers can you lend me $20 pay you on the way back ?"

						   I'll keep this one brief because you did have to be there.  A few of us were in the bar, casting our eye around Binion's, when a woman hit five 7s on a slot machine.  She didn't have the maximum on so obviously we were caning her for this gross blunder.  At this point Hugo, apropos of nothing at all, drawled "Vicky got five armadillos the other day".  If you know Hugo, it was just the way he said it, we were in fits.  Well you did have to be there.

						   Well now the dust has just about settled on WSOP 2004 and so the first thing to do is congratulate my best mate buddy pal Greg Raymer on his win.  Like that we are ! (holds fingers on top of each other).  Well not really :-).  I used to post on 2+2 a few years ago and enjoyed discussing poker stuff with Greg.  I learned a hell of a lot from him so I'm really pleased he's got the cake of all cakes.  Well done Greg !  In the mean time, having left it so long, a great deal of my gossip is already out in the open.  Beans have been spilled, thunder has been stolen, which is a mixed metaphor - or is it ?  Oh never mind, let's do it anyway.

						   Thursday night and I was in the $225 Super (one bullet - that is I had no intention of rebuying) and this was my last shot at the Big One.  I was given some hands and some double ups and at one point hit 15,000 in chips.  Due to some brain freeze on my part I had the idea that 10K chips would be par for a seat, but because $200 bought 500 chips, that wasn't the case, par was 25K.  Looking back I don't think this misconception changed any of my plays, and in any case the blinds shot up and I ran into AK to bust out around 30th (14 seats being awarded).   That being it for the week I found some of the boys in the bar and started making up for the professional abstinence of the trip up to that point.  And then some.  We hooked up with a couple of the Irish guys (always a bad sign) and I eventually reeled back to bed around 6am.  Next day round about 4 we're by the pool in the Golden Nugget and I am just starting to feel human again, when who should roll up but The Aggressor.  "Aye aye boys - you didn't have enough of a share of me last night Andy !".  Eh ?  After some explanation and vague recollections in my unhappy brain it turns out that The Aggressor has only tried to nip me for $100 the previous night to play a single table, and much to his disbelief, managed to score $200.  He chopped it and now hands me $800, result !  $300 of which I am promptly nipped for.  And so the cycle begins.

						   As I said I didn’t enter any of the main events while I was there.  I could have played the last $3,000 No Limit but decided against.  Now I’m back home I think this was the right decision.  I would have been close to dead money in this event – not because of being a particularly bad player compared to the field, but from a stamina point of view.  I watched Bushy for a couple of hours in the PL $3000 final.  During that time I didn’t see anyone give away a single chip.  Garry had to play something like 14 hours on Day One and 10 on Day Two.  I can hardly play for 3 hours without getting massive brain freeze and doing something really stupid.  It’s no wonder I do best on single tables online (and in Vegas as it happens) because you only have to play for an hour or so.  I’m reasonably fit physically, in fact I’m a marathon runner compared to most poker players, but mental and emotional stamina is something else entirely.  If I want to take a shot next year, that’s what I have to work on in the meantime.  As it happened, the $3000 NL was the first WSOP non-big-one tournament to be played over 3 days.  Unlikely as I was to last that long, if you can’t go the full distance, don’t bother, and so I didn’t.

						   Did anyone else think it was a bit off that the winner of the Media Event gave the prize to his daughter’s school ?  Not the most selfless gesture I’ve ever heard of !  Not knowing the details I’m loath to say any more, but it seemed strange to me.

						   I did promise to relate the story of DY managing to confront Phil Hellmuth.  Having talked to the man himself though (guess which one) the truth, as ever, is not quite as entertaining as the myth.  The story going round the bar in Vegas was that DY managed to buttonhole Hellmuth with “Excuse me, do you represent Ultimate Bet ?”.  Walking around in the current style of Vegas professionals, that is as a walking sandwich board of Ultimate Bet hats, shirts, trousers and probably jockstraps, PH was unable to deny this.  “Well I’m having problems cashing out” followed up the indefatigable Youngster.  At this point Hellmuth, where lesser men would have looked for the exit, pretended to phone Annie Duke because “She deals with that side of things” and then made his excuses because she was busy.  Consensus in the bar was “yeah right and Devilfish does the registrations”.   The truth of the matter though is that neither party used those exact words, and in fact David tells me that Hellmuth was courteous and fully aware of his responsibility to represent the site.  It’s still a great picture though, if you didn’t know, Phil is about 6’5” and David, er, isn’t.  He admitted to me that “eye contact was difficult”.    The fact remains, and this is the point I wanted to make, that if you do take the shilling then you ought to make an effort to represent your sponsors.  It’s the least I would expect if I was paying these guys just to wear a few shirts.  I can think of a few English players who have taken a shilling or two who barely know how to turn a PC on !   Finally you can find DY’s own Vegas diary on www.gutshot.co.uk, and also a very amusing piece by David Lloyd about logos not being allowed, check it out.

						   After one trip to the WSOP in which I didn't play any main events at all and cleared about $400, I am surely in a position to tell everyone how to win there :-).  Or not, but I'm going to anyway.  To my mind it doesn't make so much difference what game you're in (main event, super, single table, cash) as who you're playing against.  OK if you're in the top 10% of the entire poker population inside Binions at any given moment, then you want to be in the game with the "best" structure and the most play.  If, however, you're around half-way or even below then the most important thing is to find the games where the players are worse than you, and play them.  These happened to be the single table satellites.  Almost everyone I asked said, yeah, I've done really well in the single tables, I should have played more of them.   But why ?  The first answer that springs to mind is “they just were”.  When you find a money-making opportunity, don’t waste time analyzing it to death, get in there and fill your boots.  In hindsight though, there were several reasons.  Many of the top players get put in the big tournaments one way or another, and don't need to play the satellites.  They don't like the fast structure (rightly or wrongly, I'm not sure).  And, as Jesse May points out, when the fish are knocked out of the big comps they don't go into the cash games on tilt any more - they go into the single tables instead.  Many of the "new generation" of players aren't interested in cash, and I don't blame them, nor am I.  Cash games are for Nazis.  So while the single tables could be quite tricky of an evening, depending on who happened to sit down, in the mornings they were absolutely marshmallow soft.  I cleared $3000, at least $200 an hour, and most of that was in $100 satellites.  I should have played more of them :-)   Footnote : After writing this last week, it appears that there is a televised tournament currently running at the Plaza.  $10K entry - no satellites, no online qualifiers, no logos.  In other words no riff-raff.  Just us, the proper players.  Yeah right.  Just you the ego-maniacs more like.  John Juanda apparently told them where to shove it if he couldn't wear a logo, and has consequently shot up in my estimation.  Well done that man.  I'll probably have more to say about this when I've given it more thought - in the mean time have a look at the list of entries and work out which "faces" aren't playing.  They'll be the ones with more sense than ego.

						   I read something today that, at first glance, seems utterly bizarre.  One of Andrew Flintoff's sixes in his innings yesterday fell right into the lap of his own father, watching from the stand.  How cool is that ?  Unfortunately for Flintoff Sr, he dropped it, earning himself no end of "ribbing" at the dinner table if I know professional cricketers.  Isn't that amazing ?  Or is it ?  Is it just the case that of all the sixes hit in all the test matches in all the world with all the fathers watching, it was only a matter of time ?  I think it was.  And we could apply the same reasoning to Internet conspiracies and even the B+M "you won't believe the hand that came up last night" stories.  Try me, I probably would.  By the way, good as Flintoff is, I've never really warmed to him.  This is because I used to hate bowling at thugs with 3 1/2 pound bats.  Once a batsman realised he could mis-hit me for six, I was f**ked as a bowler for that day.  It is nice to see England playing with smiles on their faces though - I hope they can keep it up next time they get whomped by the Aussies :-)

						   Well we did get an answer on the Gutshot rake issue in the end (see Gutshot and Hendon Mob Forums if you're really interested) : the management can't put their names to the rake situation because it's all too dodgy. OK, that's an explanation - lots of people don't seem to mind and that's all fine by me. Caveat emptor, as per usual.  I thought I might explain why I've never joined Gutshot, despite getting on well with Barry (and Steve when he was there) and lot of the people involved. Poker is not a team game, and tournament poker is even less of one. I prefer not to have any connection with people I don't trust. In poker, you don't have a list of people you don't trust, you have a list of people you do - and it's f**king short. While 90% of gutshotters, 1808 clubbers, whatever are probably fine, it's precisely the remaining 10% that could give you a problem. I don't want anyone expecting favours from me, trying to give me favours, or looking like they are receiving a favour when I make an unorthodox play. When all that people have to do to join a "gang" is send an Email, how can you possibly vouch for them all ?   It might seem like a small thing, but if you get these things right it always saves you problems in the long run. If you want to join, fine. Do be careful of one thing though - there is a tendency in these "gangs" for people to over-congratulate each other on minor and/or plain lucky results. It used to drive me mad on Gutshot, someone would describe how the deck hit them so hard they should have won a tournament twice over, they finished 5th, and everyone would go "brilliant result mate, well done". Perhaps done with the best of intentions, but it's not good for your game to be told you're much better than you are. Caveat, as I said before, emptor.  If anyone wants to discuss this civilly, go right ahead, but flames/insults will be ignored.

						   This month's rib-tickler from Poker Europa : Nic Szeremata on Caprice's taking the Paradise Poker shilling.  "But when a glamorous model publicly endorses our favourite pastime - well that's different.  All of a sudden poker could become the new in-thing for the It girls, and could lead to an influx of young female wannabes into the poker scene".  I've heard some ridiculously optimistic predictions for the future of poker, but we have a new winner.  If "It girls" want to be letched at by fat, sweaty blokes then they'll at least go somewhere where the blokes in question have more than £20 in their pocket.  If you prefer visual comedy though, check out Jim Britton's Devilfish impression on page 50.  Just think what the photos they rejected must have looked like.

						   I have finally (I think !) decided how to progress with my poker in the short/medium term :  1) Cut Internet poker down to 8-10 hours a week, and only in games that are big enough to be worth playing in.&nbsp; Only play when I'm focused, and not just out of boredom !&nbsp; At one point on the weekend I was playing 3 micro-limit Stud Hi-Lo games at once.&nbsp; After about 45 minutes I thought "why the hell am I doing this ?".&nbsp; Also only play one game at a time.&nbsp; I should still be looking at around $20/hour, which would be around $800 a month.&nbsp; Nice money on the side without going mad.  2) Play around one medium size (£200-£300) B +M&nbsp;tournament per month.&nbsp; Rebuy comps are fine, in fact they are probably better&nbsp;- the bottom line is rebuy comps attract weaker fields.&nbsp; After reviewing my performances over the last 3 years at this level, the results are poor.&nbsp; However, I can see a lot of things I did wrong, in hindsight, and I think it's time to try again.&nbsp; If I did pick up £10K again I'd be happy to lock half of it away and have a spin at a few £500-750s with the rest.&nbsp; Having cut down on expenses lately I can spare £250 a month so this won't cut into my bankroll.&nbsp; Why not take a shot, it could be me !  3) Two holidays in the US per year.&nbsp; Probably one WSOP and one other.&nbsp; If I'm selective while I'm there and&nbsp;play plenty of single-tables I should be able to freeroll in a big comp or two each time.&nbsp; And it is a holiday after all !&nbsp; US wins hands down over Continental Europe.&nbsp; The only question in Europe is whether you're in more danger of being robbed inside or outside the casino.  I'm putting this down here so that maybe I'll stick to it :-).&nbsp; Cut out all the unnecessary rinky-dink playing-because-I'm-bored online.&nbsp; Play fewer hours, but more focussed, and live a little the rest of the time.&nbsp; Sounds like a plan.&nbsp; Got to go now, gym class !!

						   Following the WPT Invitational screened on Challenge recently (featuring Phil "The Unabomber" Laak) there was a lot of talk on the forum about "characters" and whether they were "good for the game".&nbsp; Then there was some more following reports of Tony G's behaviour at the latest&nbsp;WPT Paris event.  There are some real characters in poker it's true.&nbsp; But all those who I would class as genuine characters do not need to shout at the top of their voice all the time to get attention.&nbsp; Nor do they need to dress up like pantomime dames.&nbsp; A genuine black hat could do a lot for the game.&nbsp; But to wear that hat you need to be a top player.&nbsp; Top top.&nbsp; Cantona or Tyson.&nbsp; Or the Undertaker :-).&nbsp; The only poker player who even comes close is the Devilfish.  To be a real character you need more than a loud voice and a £4.99 joke book.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, people&nbsp;tell me that Mad Marty is a really nice, generous guy.&nbsp; But I don't know him - and at the poker table he is nothing short of a pain in the arse.  The real issue is that television has great power to influence the easily influenced.&nbsp; Monkey see monkey do.&nbsp; If you're bored watching the likes of Ivey and Lederer play poker then try WWE instead.&nbsp; There's nothing wrong with WWE, I just don't want to be in it every time I play poker live.&nbsp; If I'm going to be surrounded by wannabees every time I go out and play, I'd much rather they were wannabee Iveys than wannabee Unabombers.&nbsp; There really is little worse in poker than having to sit next to some unfunny loudmouth who thinks he's a "character", when you can't give him the slap he deserves.&nbsp; Hooray once more for the Internet and the "block chat" button.  &nbsp;

						   Ten years ago, I made a concerted effort to sort my finances out and try to ensure that I wouldn't have to work till I'm 70.&nbsp; One of the packages I was sold was a 10-year PEP.&nbsp; £60 a month tax free savings.&nbsp; £60 a month x 12 months x 10 years = £7,200 paid in.&nbsp; This morning I phoned them to check what this great investment&nbsp;is now worth prior to maturing.&nbsp; It's worth £3,300.   Now, this isn't a surprise.&nbsp; I do open some of the letters they send me.&nbsp; It's just confirmation of the worst.&nbsp; I don't want to work out how much it would have made at 2% interest in a bog standard bank account, and I don't want to know how much I have been charged for their investment expertise.&nbsp; I just want to vent my bad beat story :-)   Seriously though, caveat emptor and all that.&nbsp; But what a fucking dreadful performance that is.&nbsp; Ten years ago, an extra £60 a month was a squeeze, and now I find I would have had a better EV buying scratchcards.&nbsp; Live and learn.&nbsp; Fortunately I did so well out of my flat this is basically complaining about losing a £40 pot just after winning&nbsp;£500.&nbsp; As for my £3,300, I will decline the option to re-invest.&nbsp; Give it to me and I'll invest it.&nbsp; Betfair here we come !

						   I have just been watching a WPT Series 2 event, the one from the Commerce.  David Benyamine loses most of his chips on the river to some fat guy wearing sunglasses.  Once he's stopped his war-dance, we can get on with the next hand.  Benyamine now has 45K under the gun and the blinds are 12-24.  To the consternation of Mike and Vince, the Frenchman _calls_ with T8.  The button raises with A5.  The big blind gives a speech (just like the ones you hear in the £20 comps) and passes.  Benyamine makes a straight and scoops, cue the big blind muttering "I would have chopped that".  I'm only speculating here, but this could have been a very clever play.  If Benyamine takes the reflex action and goes all in, it's quite likely that at least the two blinds will just call and check it down.  By calling, maybe he increases the chances that someone else will raise and he will be heads up.  By holding chips back he ensures that there will either be a pre-flop raise or a bet on the flop, either of which might knock out a potential winner.  It's always worth stopping to think about the alternatives, especially just when you're about to do "what everyone else does".  One thing I'm becoming more and more sure of in poker, if _everyone_ does something it's quite likely to be wrong at least some of the time.

						   and your Daddy !  Remember that one ?  I had mercifully forgotten all about it until ESPN's WSOP 2003 Day 2 coverage brought it back to me (on Challenge last night).  This is the one where Phil Hellmuth shows us his own take on meditation - sit down, close your eyes, and think about how great you are.  Those ancient mystics eh, no idea had they ?  Newly filled with serene inner confidence, Hellm-you-th as Norman Chad insistes on calling him (surely this guy should be only filmed behind a wall with just his eyes and nose poking over) takes his seat only to face his deadly nemesis Sam Grizzle, who chinned him once.  How he's the only one I'll never know.  Over the course of the show the two trade insults in the style, as I said on the Mob Forum, of two 12 year old girls.  But I knew there was something missing from this analogy, and that was Daphne and Celeste.  Phil and Sam reminded me of Daphne and Celeste bopping away on CD:UK ribbing each other in their own playful style.  As it happens I was at Reading when Daphne and Celeste performed their famous two-song set - both their classic hit and "U-G-L-Y / you ain't got no alibi / you ugly (Phil) !"  It was kind of sweet, one group of fans went to the trouble of taking a bedsheet, painting "YOU SUCK" on it in giant letters, dragging it all the way to Reading and then unfurling it on D&C's taking to the stage.  I always hoped that they kept it, just think how often a bedsheet with "YOU SUCK" painted on it would come in handy.  As usual though, press reports of the 15-going-on-27 popsters being bottled off the stage were as wide of the mark as a, erm, bottle.  They hid at the back of the stage and were laughing half the time.  If you want to see a bottling, try to find footage of Adrian Edmondson's spoof heavy metal band playing Donington's Monsters of Rock (which they did, for real).  Now THAT'S a bottling.  Scary stuff.  It would have had Phil donning his double strength Oakleys and baseball cap with plexiglass visor, and running for the hills !

						   I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean yesterday (good fun if you're not too picky) and as usual I found myself hopelessly confused at the twists in the plot.  If you've seen it, consider the bit where Johnny Depp shoots the bad guy with his one shot and then throws the last coin to the elf dude.  If that was me I would go "Oh, er, what, do I throw this in the chest ?  But that'll bring them all back to life.  Should I keep it then I'll be immortal ?  Or give it to the totty ?  Give me a second, I'll get this ..."  And the bad guys would win.  It reminded me of a recurring nightmare I used to have.  I'm in a super-tough interview, but I've got all the way to the end.  "One more question Mr. Ward," says the suit "you know that bit in Where Eagles Dare where Richard Burton makes them write down the names of all the double agents ?  Could you explain that to us please ?"  "Oh, er, bugger, erm, he thinks they are spies, no that's not right, they have to prove to him that, er, no" and I lose the job and have to live in the gutter.  The point being ?  Thinking logically and quickly under pressure is not my strong point.  Tournaments suit me better than cash games because they (seem to) lend themselves to off-line analysis much better.  Short-stack play in particular can be honed off-line to the point where I know what to do in most situations before they happen.  And when I do have a hard decision, I really need to take my time and think it through.  I used to think that playing quickly showed confidence, which it probably did in rinky-dink Luton comps, but now I realise that taking your time doesn't show weakness, it's just sensible.

						   Well it turned out that you can copy in posts and change the date so it looks like they were there all along.  So that's what I have done !  I have resisted the temptation to change them so they predict what subsequently happened, and have just added a note or two where appropriate.  The blog format should allow me to post more frequently, and where necessary, "on location" when I am on a trip abroad.  Please do add your comments, and enjoy !

						   ... use a long spoon.  I'm not talking about the Devilfish here (although the proverb still holds true !) but the omni-present one-eyed demon Television.  I was quite keen on the Pot-Limit championship held in Dublin last month, I tried to qualify for a few $ (nothing mad).  It sounded like the organisers wanted to put the players first, logos were allowed, and so on.  However, reports are coming out that there were a lot of problems with this event.  I withold full judgement and the organisers have a chance to respond.  Reports to date say that, among other things, players were promised that heats would be televised throughout but in some cases only the final six were shown ;  that the structure was changed half way through, apparently because no one had realised that a slower structure meant it would take longer (duh) ;  that a player's hand was announced over the tannoy by a commentator during the action (although the player was Hellmuth so that's quite funny) ;  and that the draw was not completely open as had been originally stated.  It still sounds like the players are the lowest priority once the cameras start to roll.  We shall see.  In the meantime I would advise very strongly against playing (or trying to qualify for) televised events which do not allow logos to be worn, and to be careful with the ones that do.  Apart from anything else, you might well do better not to commit to any sponsor beforehand - negotiate a better deal as and when you make the final instead.    At the end of the day there are cheaper ways to get your face on TV if that's what you really want.  Especially late at night (and not just your face) :-).  Just be careful with these.  [Note 9/7/04 after some deliberation, a reference to Andy Glazer in the above post was removed in respect of his untimely death]

						   There are two questions you can ask yourself. 1) Am I good or am I lucky ? 2) Am I bad or am I unlucky ? Obviously the first is a better one to be asking, but you may not have the choice. How do you tell how lucky or unlucky you have been over a run of results ? If you have been playing a particular game for so long that you know what your expected rate is, then you can tell. But then again, games can change, you can change - you should change, you should be getting better ! So what can we do ?  There is one thing I have been trying which helps to get a handle. This applies to No-Limit tournaments and Sit & Goes. I call it the All-in-ometer (snappy eh ?). Basically any time you are all-in pre-flop, write down the hands and the size of the pot, and whether you won or lost. Once the game is over, calculate your expectation from each pot and what you received in each pot. Add up the actual returns, subtract the expectations, and that's what the All-in-ometer reads. A plus number is lucky, a minus number is unlucky.  Here's an example. In a particular Sit and Go, my all in hands were as follows :  AJ v AQ for a 2700 pot. I am a 5-2 dog with this hand, my expectation is 2700*2/7 = 750 (rounding to 50 is fine). The board double paired, I split the pot and my return was 1350.  JJ v AK for a 3700 pot. I am slightly better than even money so my expectation is about 1900. I won that for a return of 3700.  So my total expectation for those two pots was 750 + 1900 = 2650. I actually won 1350 + 3700 = 5050 so the All-in-ometer records +2400 which is well in the red zone of "lucky fish". I actually finished third in the Sit and Go which wasn't very good considering the luck I had ! I should mention that in standard 50-30-20 Sit and Goes, I only count the all-ins before we reach the last three players. That's the whole point after all (making the last three), and heads-up play in particular may swamp the more important pre-money action. Another tweak is that I sometimes play pots where I don't put all the chips in pre-flop but I know I'm not going to fold later on whatever - if the hand goes to the river, this counts too. I'll talk a bit more about this particular play in the next section.  So basically, after a tournament, a large negative number implies that you were unlucky and shouldn't worry too much. Especially if the number is larger than the number of starting chips. However, if the number you end up with is large and positive, you were a lucky fish and should have made it pay. Now, this isn't foolproof. Note that if you go all in with AK and run into AA for example, that only produces a small negative number but in fact it is just plain unlucky. Similarly you can get it all in on the flop in front and be outdrawn, or vice versa. And you should never, ever let the cart drive the horse and say "If I go all-in here that's favourable on the All-in-ometer" - just play your normal game and note the results.  I just find it's useful for keeping an even temperament. If you do all your chips in a multi-table, or lose 5 Sit and Goes in a row, you have the numbers to back up that you were just unlucky (if that's the case). On the other hand, if you're scoring pluses on the AIO but not making profits, you should be looking hard at your game (or harder than usual !)  So we come to the point. This week I have gone back to Sit and Goes after a short break and been tearing them up. But I've only played 16 of them. Consulting the overall All-in-ometer over the 16 comps returns a reading of +6600. With 1500 chips costing $25, we can equate that to roughly $110 worth of luck, and estimate that our expected rate per tournament is probably $5-$10 less than the actual rate recorded. Knowing this should help me when I hit a bad run - I won't be thinking that this week just gone is how it "should be". Instead I know that I was running on the hot side.  It's not exhaustive at all, and should be taken with a pinch of salt rather than too seriously, but I find it helps, especially during those times when you're not too sure about your game. Try it and see !

						   Here's an excerpt from one of Simon Trumper's recent diary entries (which you can find  urlLink here )   "everyone passed to me and in the small blind I found ATs , with $10,800 out there. With the BB having $35,000 it was pointless making a standard raise to 12,000 as if he moved in I was calling. So I moved all in"  Simon ! Just because you would call a reraise, it doesn't follow that moving all your chips in is the best play ! Making the standard raise may have the following advantages :  - Your opponent might just call giving you the opportunity to outplay him on the flop  - A smaller raise may tempt him into calling with a worse hand  - Then again, a smaller raise may actually look scarier and may cause him to fold a better hand  - He might try to bluff reraise with nothing at all  To be fair, it may not too ! Your opponent might outplay you on the flop, or bluff reraise and make you pass. But there are things to think about here and I do think Simon's logic is off. It's a bit like the (more obviously incorrect) argument "I'm going to call on the river anyway, so I might as well bet". Simon has told me he reads this occasionally so I'd be interested to hear a response !  Here's another one, from Brad Daugherty in the mostly very good "Championship Satellite Strategy". Brad talks about raising half his stack with AQ only for Amir Vahedi * to come over the top with AJ. Brad calls but loses the hand. He now reasons that it would have been better to go all in and discourage AJ from playing. I think this is just plain wrong (and so did Mason Malmuth in his review of the book BTW). In this situation you should be delighted to get a shortish stack all in as a 5-2 favourite. Survival concerns nowhere near outweigh the 70% chance of doubling up. Certainly if anyone's got better than AQ they aren't passing whatever you do. Why not try to get some action off a worse hand (although don't make a girly Internet raise and let everyone in :-)).  Above I was talking about having a good run in Sit and Goes. Apart from my luck :-), I think one reason for this is when I am in the zone of about 12-16 small blinds, instead of going all in I have raised to about 6 [small blinds] and kept the rest back for the flop. I was going to analyze this in detail, but instead I'll just say that I think the pros of this play definitely outweigh the cons, provided you only fold on the flop if you're really absolutely positively sure that you are beaten and have no outs !  Nuts to the analysis anyway, it just works better :-).  Try it and see !  Over-betting the pot in No-Limit is not generally a good idea if you're a better player than the field.  And if you're a worse player than the field, what the hell are you doing in the game ?  * It could be that Daugherty is just taking the opportunity to have a pop at Vahedi who is not the most respected player at the top level. Stranger things have happened in the poker book world :-)

						   Of sorts ! Why not, haven't done one in a while. I rolled up to take a shot at the £750 freezeout in the Vic last night. Just one major name on my table to start with - the fantastic Xuyen Pham, Pot-Limit World Champion ! As I said on the forum I was really pleased to see Xuyen win that and it was nice to congratulate her in person. Unfortunately she hit a "death card" to make her the straight but her opponent the full house so she was first out this time. I don't have a great start and drop to about 3K (starting chips 5K) before a controversial limp on the button with A7. No raise, flop 765 with 2 clubs, BB comes out betting. Hmm, so many draws he can have that I think I have to play, and so I have to raise as there are so many scare cards could come off. He calls, 87, no straight and I double up. Then I double up again, finding AA against the table fish who looks disturbingly like Phil Neville.  At this point I fancy opening it up as one of the larger stacks, but it doesn't quite go to plan. Paul Phillips arrives on my right and turns out to be a nice guy. It was probably a bit foolish of me to go after him in a blind v blind situation, but hey, you gotta get up to get down :-). That costs me 2K and the blinds are creeping up. I win a couple with 76s and then a spectacular 62 off, both times getting a caller from the blinds and taking it down on the flop. You feel like you've earned it when you win with that ! Then comes the pivotal (and needless to say final) hand of the evening.  Geezer on my left has just arrived with a big stack. Haven't seen him before, looks like a typical VOG (Vic Old Git). I have just over 7000, playing 300-600 with a 50 ante. At this point I'm not dead keen on being the first raiser - I'd rather be the reraiser and put the big decision to my opponent. So one of the plays up my sleeve is to limp from the button or small blind and if I get a raiser, reraise all in. And so it comes to pass that it's folded around to me in the SB. Alright then, I limp. He bets 2000. Let's do it, I raise all in 5K more. It's now 5K to him with about 11K in the middle. To my discomfort he calmly and methodically, without ever looking like folding, counts off the chips and calls. "Good call" I have to say as I turn over my rather unspectacular K6. But to my complete amazement he shows down JT offsuit. Straight on the river, and that's that. I don't say much but can't help a quick "I thought I was bluffing ...", "Little did you know" drawls Phillips. Little did I know indeed ! Looks like I picked the wrong guy to bluff. Or the right guy to reraise for value with K6. Who can tell ?!  So that's the way it's going in £750 comps these days ! I'm not disappointed though. I tried a few different things and made some moves, and in the end I got it in from the front. And made the last tube :-). Better than clinging on till 3-30 and going out 24th. Back to the Internet for me I suppose. £1000 No Limit in Luton in August maybe ? Could do !

						   In my opinion the "must-read" poker blog on the net is  urlLink Paul Phillips  . I searched it out after meeting him at the Vic in July. He is a very, very clever guy who cuts through the mystique of top level tournament play and tells it like it is. And he canes Hellmuth a lot :-)  His latest entry caught my eye :  "I was never in the camp that having my hole cards exposed to the world would be detrimental to my results; I was indifferent because television almost never gives you enough context and unless you understand WHY a player does what he does, you are no closer to predicting his future actions.But now I feel like I'm totally in a position to manipulate people who have seen me play on TV. Since I know exactly what's been on TV I can assemble a model of myself based on that and (with numerous caveats) grant that model to strangers. If you can form an accurate sense of your opponent's model of you and make the correct adjustments, you have a monster advantage.The more I think about it the more convinced I am that this is a good thing. "  Good thing for Paul = bad thing for me if we ever end up on the same table again. Quite often lately I've been watching some poker tournament on TV, bored, but thinking "come on, you have to watch this to see how so-and-so plays, if you have the ambition to play at that level". But of course he's right. Real players are capable of staying one step ahead by knowing their image, as it has been projected on TV. A good excuse to just go to bed early next time the WPT is on Challenge. Which is every night, pretty much.

						   Had a shot at this last night, but it's still Barnet v Forest Green for me this afternoon rather than playing poker for £60K.  Nil desperandum though, it wasn't a bad game and I quite enjoyed it.  Fairly quiet to start with, 5000 chips and 25-50 blinds, pot limit, no real maniacs on our table.  I drop 2000 by flopping a straight in an unraised pot and paying off on the turn when the board pairs ;  but I felt I had to pay him off as it was only 1000 more and he was a total fish.  Incidentally this was a player who I know is a "slider" in No-Limit (likes to overbet the pot by moving all his chips in).  In PL he was the deadest of dead money.  I recover to about 4500 but drop another thousand just before the buyins ended.  Pretty soon the table gets broken and I am moved next door - onto Jac's table.  Now I'm thinking, wouldn't it be just like poker for Jac to knock me out after my comments on here yesterday.  But poker turns out to be even more perverse than that, and he doubles me up twice :-).  I try a steal reraise on a local who I think has me pegged as a rock, but unfortunately he also can't put a hand down, convinces himself that I have a small pair, and calls with A7.   Seeing as I have 87 this isn't good.  First card 8 though ching !  Now my cover is blown so I can't do much without hands.  On my immediate left, Tony Bolton and Garry Bush are picking up big pair after big pair with someone throwing chips at them every time.  No such luck for me and the blinds get up to 600-1200 when mid position limps and I check the BB with 98.  Flop T97, I check-raise, it all goes in (I had about 11K before the hand),  and his QT holds up.  Thank you and goodnight.  I thought I was favourite there but it turns out I was 45%.  Not to worry, I gave him a chance to fold and I'm happy with the play.  So all in all not too bad.  It was the right game to play in, which is half the battle.  And it was nice to catch up with a few people, players and staff.  I think my enthusiasm for the game is coming back, slowly but surely.

						   I can't quite decide who was the most comically naive poster on the Mob Forum this week. The guy who thought that Donald Trump posted under the name MadYank, or the guy who thought Jac Arama would "dominate the poker world over the next five years".  Apologies to either poster if they were joking, but if I were to list all the reasons why Jac Arama will not dominate the poker world over the next five years we'd be here all night. Jac isn't the worst player you'll ever see ; against typical fields in medium-size tournaments he will run over a lot of the players who are simply trying to occupy a seat for as long as possible. What our poster is missing is that so much of what makes a top-notch player has nothing at all to do with how he plays at the table. Just two of the attributes required are excellent emotional control and brutally honest self-appraisal. There is the odd exception (Hellmuth perhaps, though I think he's going off the rails), but Jac doesn't have these attributes (or several others) and he isn't the exception, I can assure you.  Nonetheless, what we are hearing is good news. There are a lot of people out there who see Gus Hansen terrorising the field in the WPT and think that's all there is to it. Just raise with 47 off and keep betting. Now, IMO the jury is out on Hansen until he shows us what he does now that his game has been "outed" to such an extent. But I believe that he is a very clever guy who has won more than his share by knowing when NOT to make these plays. Selective aggression gets the cake, but indiscriminate aggression does not, in the long run, and that's what people fail to realise.  Coincidentally, I am thinking very hard about mixing up my game, taking chances, getting chips or getting gone. But hopefully I'm thinking harder than the people who watch a couple of heavily edited TV shows and think they know what's what. As ever, time will tell.

						   What I have immediately found is that if I cut Internet Poker down by about half, it's just as easy to cut it out entirely. I can't really be bothered to play it. Basically, I already spend 30 hours a week making $x per hour - it's called a job. And as much as I might complain about it at times, my job makes plenty to get by on, and is usually more interesting than playing online poker.  So while the net is always there if I need to fall back on it, I don't have to play it at all if I don't want to. For example, recently I have made just over $1000 playing $25 Turbo Sit and Goes on Stars, in about 35 hours of play. But after a while I was SO BORED I just could barely face playing any more of them. Provided I won it was OK, but losing (especially on the bubble) caused far too much frustration (any at all is too much !). So I have cashed most of it in, leaving about $100 in a couple of sites for fun, and will concentrate on the medium (£100/$200 and above), live tournament scene.  Money-wise, this isn't the smartest move. I'm already about £5K down on these and they have been subsidised in the past by small tournament earnings. But throughout my poker career, it's not necessarily being good that has been enjoyable or satisfying, it's getting better. There's plenty of room for improvement, I have the bankroll (and it's not too hard to replace if necessary), and I have quite a few ideas to try out. I'm also encouraged by my play at the WSOP which I was happy with, especially the one table satellites.  So if I do that, maybe we could knock US trips up to 3 a year instead of 2. It's 4 months since the last one, so we must be due another ! Four Queens anybody ? See you there !!  And if anyone's playing the £250 in Luton tomorrow night, I'll see you there too.

						   The latest game to hit the poker tables of Europe is the World Speed Poker Championships. Two dealers, 15 seconds to make any decision and, here's the best bit, an Estonian model with a stopwatch standing behind every player (I'm not making this up). All in an effort to re-create the pace of an Internet tournament.  This is great news. In the old days, if I wanted to play an Internet tournament, my only option was to turn my PC on. Now, thanks to the WSPC innovators, I can also fly out to fucking Estonia.  Excuse the sarcasm but what is the point ? I hope Anres Baiget on Gutshot can tell us more about this because he rules.

						   Right back at the start of this Diary, I promised I would quote some win/loss figures, and I haven't yet. So, seeing as I have just done some work with my database, I thought I would put that right. I'm not going to comment on these for now, just state them. All comments are welcome though, and yes, I know, why don't I play more of the games I win in and less of the games I lose in ! All figures are in US $ because that makes them sound bigger :  UK Small Tournaments (  Hold-Em .. Played 188, Net +$12,120 Other ................P 318, +$23,490  UK Large Tournaments (>= £100 buy-in)  Hold-Em.............P 51, +$970 Other..................P 28, -$10,100  US Tournaments (all)  Hold-Em.............P 26, -$4,550 Other..................P 15, +$1,210  Continental Europe (all)  Hold-Em.............P 2, -$3,400 Other...................P 3, -$1,200  Single Table Satellites  US........................P 64, +$3,880 UK.......................P 4, -$560  Super-Satellites  US.......................P 11, -$3,060 UK.......................P 16, -$1,290 * Includes Grand Prix etc. Europe.................P 3, -$550  Total..................... + $16,960  Minus a few hundred on-line, plus a few hundred more in cash games, and that's about it. I did promise to do it, and thought people might be interested ; I'm sure that there are others who do a lot better, and others who do a lot worse. Comparisons are odious in any case :-)

						   Looking back, I thought I'd go through a truly horrible play I made in a tournament 3 years ago. The twist is that it was made during the competition in which I won £10K, and if I had played the hand right, I would have got nothing at all !  I can't remember the exact stack sizes and so on, but we were 6 or 7 handed at the last two tables. A shortish stack went all in on my right, and I was on the button with QQ. I know the stack sizes are important, but basically the raise was about pot-size and I had enough chips for a pot-size reraise, plus a few more. I flat called, the chip leader went all in, and I passed. CL showed A8 against the all-in's KQ, and an Ace flopped to win it.  Everyone I asked at the time said I should have reraised with the Queens. I am now utterly convinced that they were wrong. The call was fine - the big mistake was passing to the reraise. It's a similar situation to the one in the WPT (which I haven't seen, but which has been discussed at length here and there) where Chip Reese goes all in, "the car wash guy" calls with QQ and Barry Greenstein goes all in over the top with AK. Car wash guy calls, Greenstein hits a K to knock them both out, and CWG is savaged on RGP by all the Monday morning quarterbacks.  Two players for whom I have the utmost respect, Paul Phillips and Steve Badger, came out very strongly in the CWG's defence on this one. Basically, flat calling with QQ won't make any difference against the two hands it hates (AA and KK), and the one it doesn't mind much either way (AK), but will encourage all sorts of reraises from weaker hands like JJ, TT, AQ - even A8 in my case ! Check out this month's "Pro Tip" on the Hendon Mob site - they recommend reraising with  nothing  in this spot !!  There are a lot of people out there in big tournament land who will assume that you are weak if you just call an all-in. There is a great deal to be said for just calling an all-in with any hand that can take the heat if reraised - AK, QQ or better, maybe even JJ. Tournament players are so aggressive these days you have to find ways to use that against them - and this is a good one.
