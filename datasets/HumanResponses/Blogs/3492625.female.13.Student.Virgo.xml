      Hello my public, for this is Twix's new blog! Real rantings will not start until tomorrow, I'm afraid. Anyways, I am an  obsessor  with anime. My favorites are Wolf's Rain, Shaman King, Hikaru no Go, Naruto, Inuyasha, and a  lot  more.

      Today...I found a virtual pet site like neo, but  better . It's called  urlLink Furry Paws  and it is a virtual dog site. You can breed, show, do agility/herding/tracking/etc., feed, play and everything. Remind me never to go on neo again >:]  But,(this might just be for me though)it is a  tad  bit slow.  My..uh..numberthing is  urlLink 51972  for you who want to know. Currently I have two GSD's but I do want to get a corgi^^;.  Anyway, today I made brownies. They tasted like cocoa puffs. :] Tomorrow I'm going to make Lemon Bars. Yummy. And you can't have any. Hahahaha. =P  Hahahaha! Pickles!  xD

      I didn't post it yesterday but SCHOOL IS NOW OUT! I am veryveryvery much glad and very much looking forward to HS.   Anyway, today I went to the mall and got a calander to add to my collection. It is a calander with Pembroke Corgis on it! Cute! It will join the wall where I have my two wolf calanders and my Shiba Inu calander.   I got a Cinnabon! YUMMY! ^^  Also on neo I finally got my hands on a brown pb. Now I'm setting my sights on a white one. Neo username is wolfsrayne if you want to donate. *puppy eyes*
