         A couple of nights ago, when I was laying on my bed focusing on not to focus on anything since I wanted to sleep, I hear this strange sound coming from the wall. I live wall to wall with some strange persons I started to think when I after a, somewhat confusing, "thud thud thud thud"-sound got surprised and scared by a "aaahhhhhhhhh"-sound. This "aaahhhhhhhhh"-sound was not a scream, it was more like a long tired sound belonging to some unknown animal from southern Timbuktu, or outer space. I immediately thought they had a secret restaurant which only served to be extinct animals (yes the clock was 4:30 am and yes I was most certainly making strange conclusions) - I saw this somewhat crappy Mafia film where this occurred. Anyway, I changed my mind when remembering the strange thud-sounds - OH MY GOD ARE THEY BEATING THEM?! (Wasn't that tired) - and thus concluded that they are a lot stranger than I am and do have more peculiar hobbies. I now got back to trying to fall asleep, which is hard when you're me, but of course something even more frightening was going to happen. The scream of death. It was like "AHHHHHHHHH" and so loud it could have been some hungry monster under my bed (thank God it wasn't). It made me jump like half a meter straight up in the air (thank God my bed is soft) and after that it took like ten minutes to recover from the awful experience. Actually I still haven't recovered... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO?! WHAT IF SOMEONE DIED?! Ok, maybe I still have my sanity, but I will never again ask them for anything! I'm probably better of not knowing what happened, though whatever did happen - dead human, dead animal... - it was bad. Evil lurks in every corner of that house, I tell you! Bad neighbors must be the worst invention since the sheep.

         I've totally lost it. Seriously, I'm so mentally disoriented I can't even differ left from right... or was it, hmm... never mind! It really hurts me that my life is this strange. I don't know what to feel or think about anything - it's so complicated I can't even make out if it actually is complicated or not (when I think about it ought to fit someone simpleminded) and thus explains it with this crap. Blah, like anyone will ever read this anyway. I mean there are like millions and billions of different guinea pigs on this site. By signing up you doom yourself to eternal walling (new verb created by YOURS TRULY, meaning "talking to a wall"). Getting back on track; ARGH HELP ME! MAKE SOMETHING GOOD OUT OF ME! Please I beg you, yes you american human being, adapt me to your stinking society of useless skin blocks that resemble me (but better)... I, seriously, beg you! OK, this time, getting back on the real, solid, preferably metal track! Geez, there's no track nor spoon here... just shoot me, or worse condemn me to eternal blogging (walling) on this site! The horror... the horror...
