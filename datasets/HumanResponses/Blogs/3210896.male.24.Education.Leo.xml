        urlLink Bill Gates said blogs had advantages over other, older ways of communicating such as e-mail and websites.    WHEW! If he didn't like blogging, I don't think I could live with myself. I'm not even sure I could go on blogging without Billy G's seal of approval.  =/

      As soon as I get a new digi-cam, I'm going to be using this nifty tool.   urlLink Hello.   As for right now...well, no pictures to speak of really. I'm a sad, strange  little man  fat guy.

      So this whole American Idol thing came from the British show Pop Idol, right? Anyway, we've all heard of Kelly, Justin, Ruben, Clay, and so on. From time to time, I even see Kim Caldwell (Season 2) on the TV Guide channel. Well, today as I was working on my computers, this song called 8th World Wonder came on. I was digging it, and then I looked at the title and it was Kimberly Locke! The 2nd runner-up from Season 2. She's a heckuva singer!  You can check the song out on AOL or call your local pop/rock station and request it.  Nice job, Kim.

      Well, today is the last full-day of school for the students, and the next-to-last full day for the faculty. It's crazy here. I've got computers ALL OVER my room, and I've got to get them all back in place in two days. Yeah, I can see that happening. More like I see myself working again this Saturday ... without OT pay.  Lovely.  We got to see a few of the teenagers graduate last night. What an awesome accomplishment for them. I can't believe I've been around these guys as long as I have. What will hurt is when the kids from Children's Church graduate...yikes. Between that, and my daughter growing like a weed, no wonder I have gray hairs popping up.  Life, ain't it grand?

      I just want to say, before the signs of the time approach, that I think  urlLink Six Apart  has shot themselves in the foot with  urlLink MT 3.0  and  urlLink TypeKey .  I'm glad I dropped MT now. No regrets at all...  We now return you to your not-so-regular blogging. (Thanks,  urlLink Google )

      Well, the folks over at  urlLink Six Apart  released the new  urlLink Movable Type v3.0  today. Needless to say, it was a long time coming. However, it went over like a lead brick. It seems like they've thrown a wrench into the gears  by putting a price tag on certain "levels" of the once free-for-all system.  I'm pretty happy with  urlLink Blogger  right now. I'm not doing much with my site for the time being, since I don't have a PC at home.  urlLink Phil  says I need to switch to  urlLink Mambo . That thing is loaded! The folks at Slash Dot recommend Word Press.  It makes me wonder what  urlLink the 5th dentist  thinks of it all...

       Well it's a day for the Aflac duck here in 'Bama. It started raining as we left church last night and is still raining as of this morning. Yuck.  We were scheduled to have "Field Day" here at the school, and they didn't reschedule since it wasn't pouring rain. Some were glad, some were not. Either way, the kids love it. I didn't stay outside long. I just wanted to watch our principal get a few pies in the face as a small fund-raiser. I've done that...it's not fun!  Tonight, my brother will be getting his degree from a local college. And not very long after that, will recieve another degree. He's been working real hard on completing his education and I've got to say, I admire his hard work. I'm going to be starting up this fall.  And finally, this weekend, we're going to be visiting my wife's grand-father, who is in a nursing home. Her grand-mother passed away back in February. She's still missed by many, so going down there isn't the easiest thing.   That  folks is my not-so-exciting life for the next few days.

      Well, thanks to  urlLink Just Bob , I now have my very own  urlLink Gmail  account. I'm pretty pumped so far, as it runs quite smoothly and it has a GIG of storage. Hard to believe. But in Bob's words... I have no clue as to what I am going to do with a gig of storage... but I shall try! Too true, Bob...too true.  I'm thinking I'm going to centrally locate all of my mailboxes to Gmail once it leaves the beta stage. But right now, I'll use it as my secondary address. For those of you keeping score at home, here are my two e-mail addresses:   yahoo.at.andythegeek.dot.com   Oh, and my Gmail address is:   ymgeek.at.gmail.dot.com   The AOL address that I've been using for a while will be no more in a few weeks. I can't justify the cost of my AOL account since I have no computer at home right now.  Thanks again, Bob.

         I was being tortured by the  urlLink Wiggles  songs that were repeating in my head all morning. I mean, I made it through the morning routine without Alyssa actually asking to watch "Dorothy" but I still can't get the songs out of my head? It must have been from the DVD playing last night. Imagine a grown man sitting at his desk singing about cold spaghetti and boot-scooting. It's a scary thing. So I mentioned it to  urlLink Phil  and he reminded me about iTunes.  iTunes - God's gift to music-loving geeks . Needless to say, I cranked it up.     I'm feeling so much better now.

      Well, at least school is  almost  out. We've got 8 days left with students, and 2 days of end-of-the-year work remaining. I'll be working about 6 days out of this summer. The rest of the summer will be spent with my daughter, cleaning my home, and various youth and children's ministry stuff. I'm looking forward to it, as this is my first summer vacation as a school employee.  Angela will be taking a total of 3 classes this summer as she continues to finish her degree. I should be starting back to school this summer, with night classes. Hopefully, we will be able to balance all of this. People have been asking us if and when we will have another child - my answer? Not any time soon! We've still got to potty train Alyssa. Which is a chore to say the least. More on that later...  Speaking of daughters,  urlLink Jared  has a great  urlLink post about his daughter Macy on his blog . Be sure to check it out.  urlLink Heather  is  urlLink closer than she's ever been to giving birth to her son David .  And finally, speaking of dads and moms, Mother's Day was yesterday, and my mom, my grandmother, my mother in-law, and my wife were all at church together. We had a chance to take some great pictures, and I'll hopefully have those up soon. I wasn't able to give  extraordinary gifts this year, but I've got 364 other days to celebrate the love and joy that these women in my life give to me. I pray that I succeed in returning that joy and love to them not just one day, but every day of the year.

      My life...that's all it is. Nothing more, nothing less.  Frankly, I can't understand why anyone would care. Well, I know my wife cares...she's my wife and all. There are other family members who might care as well. You know, the occasional baby picture, a funny story here and there, and it's all gravy.  For those of you who aren't family, I just want to say "Hey, thanks!" for stopping by. I can't promise you any sort of entertainment, but hey...it's my life.

      I've enjoyed the ease of blogging that I've experienced since I switched to Blogger. It's not too simple, but not too advanced either. It works, and I like it. Especially since Movable  Hype  Type has become such a pain in the neck. Along with Blogger, another thing that I've discovered is w.bloggar. It's a tool (that many of you already know about and use) that allows you to post to a blog without having to access the main interface. It would have been great to use with the previous versions of Movable Type, back when it was free and user friendly. Now, with Blogger, I can post via w.bloggar, and not have to log in to the Blogger "Dashboard" every time I want to post.  One thing, however, is that I have yet to actually  post  using w.bloggar. Sure, I've used it to type up a few entries, but I haven't used it to actually publish a post to my blog. That will be the true test of this thing, I suppose.  And now that I've bored you to death, I think I'll be moving on.  Peace, AtG

      Well, now that school is over and summer break is here, I'm spending a lot of time at home with my daughter. She's 2 months shy of her 2nd birthday now, and she's showing it more and more every day. For example, as I sit here at type these words, my daughter is carrying on an unintelligible conversation with herself, and smacking a book because the batteries are dead and it isn't making the noises it should. And right after I typed the previous sentence, I was prompted to read the Noah's Ark book to her 3 times in a row.  So after the third time, she trots back to her play area and picks up right where she left off.  With all of the time that I'm spending here at home, I start asking myself how the stay-at-home parents do it. I know at least one stay-at-home dad, but most SAH parents are moms. Between my wife and myself, I see me being the one most likely to become a SAHD. I have to admit though, it's a scary thought. I don't feel like I get anything done around here. I am feeling pretty good right now because I'm actually getting to watch the Braves play the Phillies after having to watch Dora the Explorer all day. But my laundry is way behind, and I haven't cleaned up our dinner dishes. And if I was to become a SAHD, how would that interfere with my life as a youth minister?  So many questions, so little answers. Besides, I'm still working on prying the perpetual pacifier from my daughter's mouth while attempting to potty train her, and getting some towels washed. All of that, and I'm blogging?!  Peace, Mr. Mom

      My wife and I went to see  urlLink Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban  this weekend. A huge leap forward from the previous two both in cinematic elements and screenplay. I do, however, think that parents need to exercise caution with this movie, when it comes to allowing children to view this movie. There are a few "scary" parts and should be a lot of questions afterwards. Being able to use a movie/book such as Harry Potter to lead into discussion about God and The Gospel is something we should take advantage of at the height of the success and popularity of Harry Potter.  I recommend reading  urlLink What's A Christian To Do With Harry Potter?

      I heard the news a few hours ago.  urlLink President Regan passed away  around 3:45p (CDT) on Saturday, June 5, 2004.   According to  urlLink AP News , former president Ronald Regan is near death. In the words of his wife, it could happen as soon as this weekend.   What a legacy this man leaves behind! Being that this is the first president of my generation to pass away, it's kind of sobering. I often find myself wondering what this world would be like had he been elected president in 2000 or what if he had never been elected in the first place. I remember back in the summer of 2000, I took a tour of Hollywood and Beverly Hills and got to drive by his home. The house number is 667, he had it changed from it's original number... 666 .   See you soon, Gipper.

      I'm still alive, folks. Just still without Internet access at home. Which isn't so bad, as it leads me to do other things with my time.  School starts soon, so look for more blogging then -- what with Internet access at work and all.  Peace, Andy
