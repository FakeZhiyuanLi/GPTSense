        Best Sandwich Ever   Whenever people around here talk about Philly cheesesteaks, they're talking either Pat's or Geno's.  Both of these joints claim to have the best steaks in the city.  Guess what?  They're both wrong.  Pat's is OK and Geno's has GREAT cheese fries, but their sandwiches can't hold a candle to the true king, Tony Luke's.  No one does it better than these guys.  Sure, the line may be long and the ketchup there sucks, but after eating one of their sandwiches, even the burps will make your mouth water.  Seriously.  You haven't lived until you've had a pork sandwich from Tony Luke's.  If you're really serious, try it with sharp provolone and fried onions.  Trust me, you won't be sorry.  Besides, I'm never wrong so it's GOT to be good.  Disagree? Post a comment and let me know, but know this.........you're already wrong.    The Great Outdoors   So, I'm going to the Poconos this weekend.  Great place for fishing and hunting; too bad I don't do either.  Actually, I HATE the Poconos, but I love my family so I'm going.  You see, my sister and nephew are coming in to visit my grandparents AND my aunt and uncle.  Should be an alright time, just sucks that I have to drive so far in a truck where the wheel is about to fall off.  Now, THAT could may the trip real interesting.  Well, at least it will get me out of the house, which is always a good thing.  Anyway, not much else on my mind today.  Got to get to bed so I can be in work at 6 AM tomorrow.  Doesn't get much better than that.  Check in later on.  I may have something worthwhile to say, but probably not.  Later.  Joe

      For all of those who are coming in late, let me bring you up to speed.  It's been over a year since I've written anything more than a grocery list, and I finally decided to break that trend (Thanks, Bird!).  In order to get the juices flowing again, I've decided to try out this new "blog" thing.  Seems like a good way to get stuff written down and at the same time, communicate with the people I know.  So, all you jerks better post stuff.  Anyway, on with the show..............    Look, Up in the Sky...   So, now Bryan Singer, acclaimed X-Men and X2 director is signed to direct the new Superman film.  I have to say that I'm genuinely excited.  The guy's proven he can do superheroes (the X-Men ARE superheroes, whether you want to admit it or not) so it'll be interesting to see what he can do with the ICON, Superman.  I mean, let's face it, we haven't seen a good Superman movie since the second one.  Of course, Singer needs to cast a Superman before he can make a movie.  So, who should it be?  Just to clarify, NO ONE is better the Christopher Reeve.  Reeve is Superman and anyone who argues that can stop reading now...........................Still here? Good.  The question remains, who can fill Reeve's boots?  Brendan Fraser? Too goofy.  Josh Hartnett? Too pretty.  Tom Welling? He's already on  Smallville.   I've heard one name that sticks out.  Jim Caviezel.  Jesus Christ himself.  He's got the look to pull off both Clark Kent and Kal-El.  That and the guy can act, unlike these other jokers.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.    Are you ready.....   Football season official starts for me this Friday @ 8 PM.  Eagles vs. Patriots.  I know it's only preseason, but it's FOOTBALL.  It will be interesting to see how the Birds look with all the new additions.  We probably won't see too much but it will be a nice teaser for September.  On paper, the team looks legit but that doesn't mean shit in this town.  After 3 years of letdowns in the playoffs, it's time for my boys to step it up.  Time to bring it home for Jerome, like the song says.  No more excuses.  E-A-G-L-E-S.........EAGLES!!  Fuck Dallas and fuck A.J. Feeley.  Don't talk shit on my town or my team.  Have fun in Miami, buddy.  There's a real winner.  That's all for today.  I'm too fired up to type now.  Later.  Joe
