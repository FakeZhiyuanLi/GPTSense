      As all you web-loggers know, the Internet is a great medium to share your thoughts, but that's not the only thing you can easily share. The Internet is also a great medium to share other things, especially music!  I would like to share an idea with you, which is, in my opinion, a better way to fight illegal music downloads!  Make it legal!   I think most popstars / bands (will refer to 'artists' from now on) have a homepage. If they don't have, they should! Many of these artists use all kinds of expensive technology to give the audience a sample of their new CD, without being able to download the music for home use.  I would like to suggest the following simplification:  Give *all* your music away for free!  Let me tell you why this is a  win-win  situation by first addressing some of the advantages and then explaining how money could be made otherwise.  The advantages of offering your music for free:      Many people will be able to listen to your music and you might get a lot of new fans!    Your fans will be delighted that you give away your music for free, this is very good for your popularity and, if you wish to believe, your  urlLink Karma  ;-)         Both the people that create software to protect your music from being downloaded and the people that create software to hack this so-called-unhackable streaming technology, are forced to put their energy into something useful! ;-)        Your website demands much less security and technology costs and this money can be invested in more important things, like the looks and availability of your website!     And now, the money..  Since you are freely offering  your  music from  your  site, this will probably attract  much people  and you have to take advantage of this! There are several possibilities:      Sell CDs and DVDs from your site! This might sound ridiculous, but I think that people who really like your music and can afford your music, are ready to pay for a nice CD / DVD from you. Personally, I use the Internet to explore new music and when I find something that I really like, I'll go and buy the music!          Sell other things from your website, like gadgets, t-shirts, old-fashioned vinyl records, posters, mugs, et cetera! It's your choice to organize the production of this merchandize yourself (more profitable on larger volume), or to look for online-partners to do this for you (cheaper to set-up)!         Make a donation button on your web site! In this way, you enable both fans that aren't very wealthy and really wealthy fans to donate a sum of money they can / wish to spend.      Store information from the people that buy from or donate to you. This way, you get yourself a fan-database! Now, you can plan your tours or concerts actively, to the locations where most fans reside and you can inform these fans and offer them (and possibly their friends) discount on concert tickets!      The bottom line:  I personally tend to believe that the arms-race that is going on to protect and hack digital media is a never ending story and will only lead to higher prices for music. The money that is used to protect music from illegal copying, track and prosecute illegal downloaders can be better used to support artists and let people listen to your music freely. On top of that, criminals that make money with illegally distributing music are put out of business, at no extra costs!  P.S. Some hints to get you going:      If you can't afford the bandwidth, use (freely available) technology such as  urlLink Bittorrent  to make use of the bandwidth of your fans!          If you want to make sure that you don't violate any software patents on the music format (yes, the ubiquitous mp3-standard is patented!) use other freely available high-quality data formats, such as  urlLink Ogg Vorbis          Every new artist can start distributing their music on the Internet. They can send e-mail to their favourite artists, who are automatically able to listen to their music. If they like the new band, they link to the new artist. This way, fans can find the new artist's music!    What do you think about this idea?

      Reading books is fun! Recently, I'm only reading to fill in my traveling time and I think I should read more! For instance, instead of spending time browsing the Internet. :-)     For quite a long time, I'm aware of the fact that reading reflects one's mind. In other words, the reader interprets according to his or her frame of reference, and mood.     At the moment, I'm reading  urlLink Umberto Eco's  " urlLink The Name of the Rose ". The reason that I write this log entry is that I want to mention a quote, which the main character, William of Baskerville makes, at the beginning of the book.     He quotes the French  urlLink Alain de Lille :        "omnis mundi creatura    quasi liber et pictura    nobis est in speculum"       I love Latin quotes! :-) Especially their translations ;-)       "All the world's creatures,    as a book and a picture,    are to us as a mirror"       So, as I interpret, according to Alain, not only books (and pictures) reflect our soul / mind!      I tend to agree, and wonder if other (non-art, non-living) things reflect to us in a similar way?      What do you think?
