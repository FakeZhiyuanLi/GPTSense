       I changed the name of Summer Romp to Jones' 18th B-day, and the second summer romp has become the first, and now  only,  summer romp. Not too confusing.    Okay, that's all for the photo gallery updates for a while. Oh yeah, and can whoever started this thing put a link to  urlLink  my  blog  on here? It just bothers me, is all.

       If Jorge goes back out with judith, every single member of the original 5 krew member will be going out with someone, and not only that, but we all would have g/f's from antioch too. And, and, and...thats it. O, and you have to count rob out i just realized...just noticing

        Those who wish to obtain the picture code would be wise to check out the comments of the last post.   As for this blog, I suggest that we use it for trivia and other random crap like that. Since no one will protest, I will start it off with some Simpsons trivia.   I'll start with an easy one.  Who shot Mr. Burns?

        i guess this serves... some  inane purpose to someone...   I can't offer much in terms of MEAT to this group blog dealy, but I can offer the code I use to put that pic on my posts to people for their own use (and obviously, their own pics)...is anyone interested?

       Okay, so maybe Rob and Andy were bad ideas (they'd never do it), but other people, IE Czank, Benny, etc. etc. The thinking behind this is that maybe with more people, we can actually find a real  purpose  to this thing.  Oh, and as for the Photo Gallery, well...too bad.

       Unhappy was an understatement. Anyway, moving on  Gotta remember to link, and if you can figure out Andreas and Rob's emails where they won't delete things, by all means
