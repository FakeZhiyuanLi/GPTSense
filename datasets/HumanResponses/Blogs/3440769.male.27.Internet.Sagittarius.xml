      My family and I just got back from a great day of rafting.  We signed up with a large group of old Edge employees about a month before.   The days leading up to the trip where filled with some apprehension.  White water scares me a bit when I'm not around it.  Once we got into a few rapids I felt comfortable again.  I sure had my mom scares though.  I told her the if I should die that I'd like for my sister to have my house.  That way she'd come back from NY.  If she turned that down, it goes to my father.  This only made my mother more and more scared.  I thought it was funny but I should take it easier on her in the future.  She didn't get very good sleep leading up to the trip.  Like I said above the trip was great.  I managed to stay in the raft which was a bonus.  We lost Cor and Aaron during a surfing lesson.  They both got a little chilled from the water.  By the time we pulled out they were fine.   I hope we can all do it again sometime soon.

      Cory, my dad, and I drove together to the loading area.  We had a great time laughing about Cor’s childhood.  He sure was a wild kid.  He told me the old skateboarding stories and about when he first tried to smoke.  It felt good just reminiscing about the days of old.    Once we got to the loading area we blew up our kayaks and shuttled the cars around.  The water was the highest it’s been for my on the Alsea, but I only made the rapids fast so it was fun.    About mid-float Cor and I decided to body-surf down one rapid.  We had so much fun the girls had to join us.  We then floated a bit further and found a good spot to play in the water and eat a snack.  A little boy heard us and really wanted to join.  He left without saying anything so we took off.  Right after we all started to float he showed up, heartbroken with his swimming shorts on.  At the end of the trip we were all tried and full to the brim with fun.  I sure enjoyed the trip and definitely the company.

      Shannon and I invited my little sister (Melissa) and my little brother (Ben) into hangout and go to Toys’R’Us.  The two were very excited about the toys they picked out.  Ben got a three pack of Lord of the Rings action figures and Melissa got a Little Mermaid doll.  We also saw a great deal on a mountain bike so Shannon bought it.  The bike was $40.  She had to ride it back from the store to our house which was maybe a mile or two.  Before she set out on her ride we all met at Burger King to have lunch.   The Burger King is a favorite for the kids.  They love the play area.  I remember Melissa saying after we left Portland from going to the zoo, “Jesse, next time lets just go to Burger King.”  The local Burger King has a slide that is about 20 ft high.  The last time we were there Ben didn’t want to go to the top but this time he did it.  I think having his sister help him up to the top helped.  She really looks out for him.  Once we got back to my house we played some Zelda.  The kids really enjoyed that.  In the game there is this snotty kid with snot running down from his nose.  The kid started chasing Ben’s character around so we started yelling that, “the snotty kid is going to get you!”  Ben was shrilling in excitement as he ran from the kid.  It was quite a sight.  After some games and a little playing with the toys we took off to the Lebanon Strawberry Festival.  It was more like a fair because we didn’t see any Strawberries.  We joined up with Amy & Brent and Brent’s little girl McKinsey.  McKinsey was very social with Melissa.  She acted like they were best friends.  This was reinforced by both of them getting their faces painted like fairies.  It was funny when Melissa was sitting by McKinsey and she was shying away from McKinsey.  I said to Melissa just give her a hug and get over it and McKinsey jumped out and hugged Melissa before she even understood what I said!  Right before we left there was a beautiful sun set with a double rainbow.  We could see both ends.  It was at the point that I knew I would never forget that day.

      Jaderia graduated last Friday.  It was great to see her and see that she’s not alone.  She brings me a wide range of emotions.  First I love her dearly because I’ve seen what she’s grown up with.  She also has a flighty heart that is very caring one moment and heart breaking the next.  It’s hard to watch her love people and hurt them so deeply with her actions.  In many ways I see a lot of Jenny & my dad in her, both do the same to me.  I feel I need to mention something about how she treated us that day but before I go into that you have to understand how the seating was done.  Seats in the stands were only given to people that had tickets – We had none.  We sat in the field looking up at Jeri, Monica, and Ty feeling as though the actions that led up to her graduation went unnoticed.  I’d like to share two things from that day:  “Don’t spend your life making a shrine to yourself”  “Life is like climbing a mountain.  You should pick a goal for the summit and spend your life climbing for the top.”  After hearing the second part I realized that having a family life with kids is my summit and yet I haven’t even taken the first step toward the mountain.  I guess I’m afraid of not having trained enough for the climb.  If I would take care of my health, career, and relationship I would be ready.  Having kids and loving them more than I’ve been loved in life is what matters most to me.  I’ve felt so hollow ever since I moved out from the house.  I think I was afraid of not doing things right.

      Friday Dad and I go out looking for good camping spots.  It's raining.  We find some nice little spots along the highway up from Sweet Home.  We decide that the weather might be better over the pass so we head out.  At the summit it's snowing - and I mean it's  snowing .  We decide that it has to be better further on.  We go further East and end up heading down the Metolius River.  The Metolius is very beautiful.  It runs out of the ground and only changes a few inches each year.  We stopped to look at the head - which was my first time.  In a span of about 100 yards the river comes straight out of the ground.  I hear it is a get place for fly-fishing.  We checked out all of the camp area and didn't find the privacy we were looking for.  We did have six kids, lol.  Then at the end of the road we decided to get out and look for something off the beaten trail.  We found a few excellent spots.  We then went in to Camp Sherman to ask about the spots.  Dad cleared everything up with a ranger and we headed back to pick everyone up.  After a couple of hours we had everyone in the cars.  The bigger kids traveled with me in the GTI.  We ended up having to stop for gas in Sisters before cutting back down the Metolius.    Once we got to the camp site we all started packing things down.  I noticed a pack of beer in Dad's van and made a small comment to Laurie about it being real or not.  She said it was real and said it was for her.  I totally blew my lid as I helped Dad down the hill.  It pissed me off that someone would jeopardize my Dad's sobriety just to get a buzz on.  Dad could see that it wasn't a small matter for me.  So I told him I needed to talk with Laurie about it.    We ended up discussing it and Laurie begrudgingly said she wouldn't drink.  It will always amaze me how much work it is to talk someone out of their alcohol.  If someone asked me not to bring soda on a trip because they we're on a diet I wouldn't throw it in their face - so I just don't understand why beer is any different.    Laurie was a bit pissed for an hour or two then mellowed out.  I didn't want it to be personal but it had already become that.  Hopefully she will realize that I'm only looking out for my Dad.  I'd hate to loose him.  So here's the thing... if I do lose him to alcohol again and Laurie is still drinking at home I going to bust both of their faces in. (notice the period)  It should never come to that.  Laurie is a smart woman with a lot of will power and Dad knows the price all too well.  Now that you've heard about the beer let's talk about the trip.  It was great!  The kids had a blast.  I had a great time sleeping with Ben for the first time.  It couldn't have been better.  The only bad thing was John cutting in to his foot and needing stitches.
