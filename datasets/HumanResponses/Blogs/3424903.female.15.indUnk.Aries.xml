      ...just want to make that clear.  Anyway life is crazy. maybe you've noticed. When i wanted love, it screwed me over...then when i didnt want love, it screwed me over. kinda lame huh? i think im cursed. And, i guess im not the only one... but i gotta tell you, i wasnt expecting him. not at all. i was already head over heels for someone else--and was just picking myself up from that--when i ran into him. 's funny how that happens... i hope he knows that i dont hate him. that telling him no was hard.  that after i gave him that note i sat on the ground with my head in my hands, feeling so incredibly small.   i hope you know, kid...

       Ive decided i want to be a cat. lol. (Dont ask.)  okay...well today was a little more eventful that latley i guess. Went to the movies with alex...and then ran to rehearsal right after. Yah, i made quite an entrance. i was 10 minutes late and they were in the middle of singing the opening number.&nbsp;So i walk through the big wooden doors, and i try to close them as slow as possible, but these doors arent alligned properly, so they always bang. And it decided to BANG right after the last note of the song. So everyone stares at me...and im just standing there like "crap that was loud" then this little girl in the show yells "your LATE" haha    &nbsp;  sheesh, that was fun.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      GRRRR. Alex...if you ever call me&nbsp;at 2:30 in the morning again&nbsp;without  probable cause --i will hurt you! or ill send my brothers to hurt you, cuz i dont think i'd be capable of doing any damage. lol.  &nbsp;i mean, c'mon tho. imagine with me now.(those of you with bad imaginations...skip to the next paragraph)&nbsp;going to bed at 1 o'clock--knowing you've gotta be up at 8 am to get ready for church. think in my head "ok, well ill get 7 hours of sleep--thats not too bad." so i fall asleep in about a half hour--only cuz im crazily tired. Then, i hear this faint "bleep" and then start hearing the rest of whatever my ring tone is called. who knows what it is...cuz i have one of those retarded old phones with classic ringtones that EVERY business person has. EW. But yah, alex you're soo....uh...MUR! (haha...good times) &nbsp;&nbsp;  Kayla has stolen my word. SHEESH, kayla. maybe ill have to send my brothers to beat you up too!!! im listening to coheed and cambria--who i love--much thanks to sean.   (bye bye beautiful, dont bother to write...hehe)

       Wow im so excited! I can use different fonts and colors. (its the little things in life...)     &nbsp;   You know what bugs me? when people say "we're  just  friends."&nbsp; I mean, would you really say, "oh, hes  just  my boyfriend." makes it sound insignificant doesnt it? And i dunno about you all, but my friends (aside from my family) are the&nbsp;most important people in my life. They dont deserve to be " just " anything. right?     &nbsp;   Ne marches pas derrière, je ne vous mènerai pas.    Ne marches pas devant, je ne vous suivrai pas    Marchez à côté de moi et soyez mon ami.  -Albert Camus &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      "It's okay to be angry and never let go It only gets harder the more that you know When you get lonely if no one's around  You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down We came together but you left alone  And I know how it feels to walk out on your own Maybe someday I will see you again  And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend"  -Yellowcard, "Empty Appartment"

      im gonna kill my brother. i get up at 8:00 on a sunday morning and rush to get ready for church, right? When its time to go, my brother is out sleeping in his caceda (sue me cause i spelled that wrong). So im totally awake now, my hair still wet from the shower, in a church skirt and all at 9 in the morning and im not even going to church cause i cant exactly drive myself there (9 more months!!). yah that was a brilliant start to the day. then my mom gets home from her rendez-vous with my dad last night. she made us cookies...a slama sunday tradition. if you've never had chocolate chip cookies with oatmeal, download the recipe right now and go make some.im dead serious. THEY'RE SOOOOOO GOOD!

I should pull that one on her sometime. ha, that'd be fun....    Kae: okay, so you know how when you're jumping of a cliff? Bri: yah..? Kae: ok well...this one time...

      Dont you love the way your hair feels after you get it cut? its all soft. yay. uhh..so besides getting my hair chopped off, i went to the ortho today, and had lunch with my madre at fresh choice. Then, rehearsal as usual--cept my mom was there to watch the little kids--so it was a little interesting. I hadnt told her about costya yet--so i had to totally keep my guard up. (sorry about that costya lol). But she found out, and she actually totally approves which is way awesome. She likes ya, costya. :) Anywho....i dont have rehearsal tomorrow or saturday! talk about bored bri. oh well. well, actually i think i might go see "Hello, Dolly!" at the Western Stage, cuz i have a friend in it. Anyone wanna come with me?

      Today was pretty much a gigantic yawn. Got up at 10 to watch a little tv, hung out at home all day, and then went to rehearsal. rehearsal wasnt too bad though. I got attacked by a group of little girls, and totally screwed up in this one scene--oh, and then sam decides that im not giving him enough attention so he goes and trambles on my script, and now its a wrinkled mess. sheesh thanks, sam. (happy now? ur in my blog)....but other than that it went well. i got to hear costya talk to his gramma in russian!!! good times.... So, im getting my wisdom teeth out in a couple weeks here. should be a thrilling experience. Im actually looking forward to the whole being pushed in a wheelchair thing. the puffy cheeks--not so much. oh well, im sure ill brighten a few peoples day with my chipmunk cheeks. haha thats a great name... "chipmunk cheeks"...kinda hard to say without sounding like an idiot though. Yah, you know you just said it outloud to see how it would sound...lol.  (Ha, making this post was an adventure, haha, only kayla understands)  no one ever leaves me comments...kinda sad. so click the thing that says "_ comments" and leave me one!
