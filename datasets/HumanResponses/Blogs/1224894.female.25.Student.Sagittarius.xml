      THINGS TO REMEMBER:  First, have a pen and a notebook with you, wherever you are...(an advice from Sir Edel, i should have took...), because right now, all my ideas went out of the window the moment i sang in Church...sayang, those were one of the few ideas left to help me with my dillema.  Second, do not expect anything to avoid misunderstandings and future hurts...(a precaution especially needed on the net). Be part of the game and go with the flow...so to speak.  Third, know the meaning of " I see...", "Hmmm...", "Hmph..."; well, sometimes these responses are so negative and confusing... I mean, let's start with "I see...", this usually means, one agrees on one's statement...but, there will be more buts...even without the "why's". Then, there's "Hmmm...", which usually means, "Let me think, is this for real? Or is he/she telling the truth?" Which leads to doubt...nevertheless, we still want to think it's the truth. And then, "Hmph!"...Well, this response is usually used when one reall scoffs at the idea being presented, or frankly speaking...rejects it as a lie and no truth in whatever one is saying...It's a good "naglalambing" technique...  Fourth, start a BLOG...it can really help ease tense muscles...and a very good substitute for a pet..since it only listens to your ranting and raving...  Fifth, "Me have got to have a life!"...

      A NEW DAY...  Now, after the break down of my computer...(what luck), again, a friend would advise me now to get an apple...Anyway, I don't know if this matters, but i might even have a hard time blogging...(as if, i blog that much). I really don't know what's happening anymore, i hardly sleep...i'm reading for the nth time, Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix...  The work on my house, has been stopped for a few days, and might not resume until next month...but i love it...at least, if my Mom tells me to go...i have a place to go to...   Hmmm...that sounds fun... still thinking about having a child though...and searching for Mr. Donor...hehehehehe That's an even lovelier idea...  Till next time...  Hey, JR...when are you blogging again.... and i saw your pics in the Apple Store...(BDW, nice legs!!!) hehehehe

      As I am writing this, a part of my life flashes back, showing the mistakes I Made, yet reliving the joy of having fun at last. This overwhelming feeling of belongingness when wrapped in the arms of comfort, leaves contentment in my being. I wondered if the stars are looking down on me and yet God makes it easier, as a silent listener, comforter and confidant.   Having made decisions that taught me how to be strong, strengthens my resolve in my quest to change for the better. But, in every happiness, there are still tears to shed and people to miss and engulfed in the pain of loss and leaving.   Once upon a time, i was just a girl, content with the attention showered on me and dancing in the rain. Now that I am a woman, everything is so trivial and the depfth of living is much more unfathomable.

      THE DAWNING OF A NEW DAY…  The clouds are out tonight and the moon and the stars are hardly visible. The cold “ber” breeze is rounding its way inside my room as I try to locate the moon. Haay…I haven’t seen any Christmas lights yet in the vicinity but I could feel the different crackle of the air…December is near.  I remember when I was in college, when I came home from Manila to celebrate sem break, my friends and I would gather immediately and plan a party. Now, I hardly go out, let alone have my friends over, because everyone seems to be living their own lives and they get much more attached to making money…and planning a family.   I took out the pictures from way back 1996-2000…and there’s this heavy feeling inside that engulfed my whole being tonight. Those woebegone days seem so long and yet, memories are still fresh…not necessarily haunting, but more on…wondering if we’ll ever be together as a whole again.   There’s one thing to say, it’s never good to have a relationship with a barkada, ‘coz if you don’t end up together, you’ll probably be hurting each other and the people around you more…and later regret the hurtful things that were uttered. My barkada BF of 5 years happen to marry someone else, and it started a rift among us…it was really bad. Now, that I’ve moved on, they couldn’t help but offer me congratulations…I was lucky enough to have escaped the clutches of early marriage due to accidental pregnancy.  Though the experience hurt me more, I still tried to be strong, maybe at that time, I was nursing my hurt pride, but I realize it was not about pride, but about hoping to salvage what was left of the friendship that started it all.   As I come across pictures of us together with the whole group, I kinda miss the thrill, the excitement, the companionable silence and most of all, the laughter shared by all every time we venture out to enjoy the rest of our vacation.   Closing the last photo album, a tear fell…not because I remember how hurt I was, but, of how good it was yet it had to end. Some good things really don’t last even if you’re swept away with emotions converging all at once or even with the foundation of friendship that started when you were still but kids.

      HEART BEAT  “Lub-dub…lub-dub…lub-dub…” The beating goes on Slowly humming with tender rub Igniting life…moving on.  Every being that knows how to love Wondering if they’re blessed from above One thing I know for sure Longing, beating, loving heart’s pure.  Many times we take for granted Life’s heartbeat often tainted With reality’s monstrosity And human curiosity.  We often like to play God, Making, creating, Zeus-like rod Destroying life’s natural flow As we continue to learn and know.  One, small life’s heartbeat Is like a morning treat To embrace the celebration of life Forgetting for a second, earth’s hunger and strife.  As we continue to experience pain Our heartbeat’s stucco sound like the rain Yet, smile amidst the sorrow For our heartbeats beat tomorrow.  Now, who among us here? Who suffered more but persevere? A heartbeat is the life we hold so dear. Wait, the beat of love is but near.

      	I just finished watching “Casualties Of War” with the family. Now, I’m facing my monitor, trying to put words together for my blog of the day. I hope that I’ll come up with some substantial and fun information on how my day went.  	Actually today was like any other day. I woke up late at about 7:30 since I fell asleep about 12 last night. I was so tired from the late night adventure that my Mom and I went through together with a good friend.   	There’s this music that keeps playing in my head…”swept away”…hmmm…  	Anyway, in the afternoon, we went to mass for the culmination of the month of the Rosary celebration, followed by a procession. Had some halo-halo together with Ma’s friends at Barrio Fiesta and met a couple who joined us for some time.  	Chin, I hope you received my e-mail…since, you didn’t reply, this blog will keep you informed.   	Been talking to Ma about what to prepare for the Undas…we’ll probably having some sandwiches made and order a cake. Yum! Auntie Sol was here and had her blood pressure checked…(dumarami na ang aking pasyente)  	Oh well, the stars are shining so brightly tonight, beckoning for a walk along the beach…at this time? Hmmm…Kinda missed chatting, but been loving the feel of my bed too much. Was thinking of buying a web cam though, but my Ate said, she’d send her digital cam…ambot kanus-a pa sad!  	And the dogs are howling again…argh! They’re giving me the goose bumps. And another argh!, classes will start soon.   	Yesterday, I had so many good thoughts, but now, everything escaped me. I’m having a hard time writing…considering I’m quite inspired. Now, what the heck’s wrong? I wonder what new movies are out…tsk.tsk.tsk.  	I really need to get out before classes start or else, I’d be a nutcase…how does Camiguin sounds? Duh! I’ll settle for Duka Bay.  	And yes, on the 6th of November, we’ll go to Duka Bay to celebrate the Despedida party of Father Dennis who’s leaving for Hawaii on the 18th, I’ll miss him surely…he’s my confidant, sort of and a very frank (sometimes tactless) adviser. I’ll definitely have fun in Duka…white beach, glass bottom boats and snorkeling…pure heaven.

      FEW REASONS TO SMILE...  As I'm now facing my monitor, i can't help but smile. I think this smile mania just started about the beginning of this week. Anyway, update...I found my new love. He's a person who plays the piano, who sings really good...and he also plays the drums really well. When he performed i was really awed...and it was instantly love at first chord! He's definitely a hunk...and who has a voice that could rock... He's Josh Groban.  When i get to the States, i'll definitely watch his shows.   Well, as i have promised, i'll be back to blogging. Although there's really not much to talk about, except, prices are high here in Nasipit. We just celebrated our fiesta last September and although the weather was hot, it was fun since most of my highschool friends from Cebu came home.  And a couple of my barkadas got hitched while they were in Cebu, (they also, told me that they got hitched with only 2 thou...hmmm...) So, it gave me this crazy idea of getting hitched in Cebu.  Tsk...tsk...what else? Oh yeah, a friend of mine from Chicago visited the Philippines for business, and we would have met if my Mom didn't hesitate, but, what could i expect, she was kinda being her true self...  Anyway, i would have love to meet him someday and i know it might be soon...so i'll be crossing my fingers for that!  And yeah, in December, i'll be in Manila.

      A PROMISE....  I'm back to blogging. After so many days of hibernating...i decided to come out in the open and spread my wings...(inspired by X-MEN 2). I was down and out these past few months since life held no meaning at all. Maybe i'm tired with the routine of living, and the heartbreaking events of the past few months led to me decision to hibernate...reest and gather up my strength, for i have been dying each time.  As trivial as this may sound, X-MEN 2 inspired me, not that i am going to admit i'm a mutant, but, at times, i really wanted to  be like Jean Grey...heck! I love Rogue too...(what with Iceman turning out to be a hunk some day), but, a part of me wants to change the world, not the entire world, but i'll start with mine.   After I spent three hours in the house that I had built, though it's just a small resting place, i was overwhelmed with the desire to cry and to shout with glee...i was filled with mixed emotions, because i'm still in awe.  Now, that i have come to the conclusion that i need a moment of hiatus, a part of me wanted to continue living in the shadows, but there's a large part of me that needed to spread my wings and move on.  Maybe this is for the better, maybe not, but i'm counting on my feel-good feeling to lead me the way...I need laughter back in my life, and the drive to live...I need to live again.  Starters...blogging...  Party...mingle with friends....  Work...find time to have fun and love working...  Love...me first.  Future...till then.

       CHRISTMAS…   	Whenever December comes, my heart always beats a different tune, it never fails to beat another tempo, and I don’t know why. More than always, I get goose bumps while reminiscing memories and moments shared. Maybe because Christmas is always a time to share, to express feelings, to give love and to be thankful for what I have. I know it definitely sounds like a cliché, but, that always make me glad.  	Sometimes, we are overworked, stressed out, and burned by all our daily experiences, and daily events. As we grow older, we become grouchy (like someone I know), temperamental (like my Mom) and impatient (like my Uncle). Sometimes, I am forgetful, like I’ve just suffered a short case of amnesia, and I can’t help it but be a grouch, but, in other cases, maturity and age sometimes make us somber and we view life in a different perspective.   	But, I think the best that we could ever do, is to not lose the child in ourselves. We have to keep in touch with our inner youth rather than be jaded by reality. I’ve often thought about the chances that I’ve ignored and the doors of opportunity that opened, yet left unexplored, and wondering if I did the right thing? But If I succumbed to regret, then, I might be living what’s left of my life as an old, grouchy and unhappy person.   	If I leave this world, as we know sooner or later we would, it just depends on who goes first, I want it to be with no regrets. Mistakes that were made in the past are the things that shaped my future. No matter how hard life is, and how bad things are, there’s no way but up.  	So, I guess, it’s up to us what we make of our future, how we would want it to be and who to spend our life with that could make our life a little more bearable as we grow older.

       ADVENT...  	I woke up a little bit later than usual because I was chatting up until dawn and my class started about 7. Fortunately, I received a text message from my classmate informing me that we’ll be meeting at 9.   	It was a restful sleep albeit a short one.   	I took a really quick shower at around 6:15 and it was terribly cold, changed into my usual get-up, grab something to bite then, go. I spoke with Luel on the way to Butuan since we took the same ride. Had a long conversation about our respective return demos, our very strict mothers, busy schedule and of course, medical experiences.  	Arrived in school about 8:30 then went straight to our assigned rooms to meet my group mates regarding our activity.   	The meeting went really well, we were already assigned to our areas of activity and later on December, we’ll be visiting the Provincial Jail, for “Handog Pamasko”. The Dean was impressed with our comprehensive report and our cheer.  	Anyway, about 11:00, I bought some DVD’s for Father Ruel, then went to the bus station and took a bus for home. I arrived at 12 noon, just in time for lunch which I terribly needed. Good thing though, even if it’s brownout, Nang Marilou managed to save me some ice for my iced tea.  	Took a well deserved nap in the afternoon…pampered myself with manicure, pedicure and foot spa. Then at 4:00. delivered the DVD’s and wrote down my schedule for Lectors’ serve.  	And now, currently, checking my e-mails, replying to some and deleting all junk mails.  	Tomorrow is the start of the ADVENT season and it’s Lola Disay’s birthday. Hmmmm…another late night for me.               December breeze is definitely here, beckoning the coming of Christmas. Christmas lights are everywhere and carols are already heard. December always makes me feel so...i'm still trying to find the exact word. Later.

       Broken Vow   Composed by: David Foster Sung by : Josh Groban Written by Lara Fabian and Walter Afanasieff  Tell me her name  I want to know  The way she looks  And where you go  I need to see her face  I need to understand  Why you and I came to an end  Tell me again  I want to hear  Who broke my faith in all these years  Who lays with you at night  When I'm here all alone  Remembering when I was your own.  Chorus:  I'll let you go  I'll let you fly  Why do I keep on asking why  I'll let you go  Now that I found  A way to keep somehow  More than a broken vow.  Tell me the words I never said  Show me the tears you never shed  Give me the touch  That one you promised to be mine  Or has it vanished for all time.  (repeat Chorus)  Refrain:  I close my eyes  And dream of you and I  And then I realize  There's more to life than only bitterness and lies  I close my eyes  I'd give away my soul  To hold you once again  And never let this promise end.  (repeat Chorus)

       UKAY-UKAY from morning till dawn...   Whew!!! Imagine, it's almost 2 o'clock in the morning and i'm still awake.   To start with, yesterday was declared a national holiday since it's the end of Ramadan, and with Gloria's new policy, the Muslim holiday is considered vital. It's good for both students and employees since everyone deserves a break. To top it all off, my class will start at 10:30 later this morning, so, i can still have a short time of surfing the net, maybe sleep for a good many hours.   Early yesterday morning, as i was making the schedule for the Choir that would lead the Novena Mass and Misa de Gallo this Christmas, i received a call from my Mom telling me to go to Gemma's place since everybody was already there for the Ukay-ukay, a craze that started due to hardened times and everyone practices practical buying.   I told my Mom i'd be with them soon, since it would really be better if i'll fit them myself. Anyway, the moment i arrived i recognized so many faces that i haven't seen in a while, mainly, because i've been busy with school, i have no social life (due to my Mom's adverse reaction on me going out)...and gald to see them once again. So, Armin, Arien & Nang Alding were there, together with Marilou A., some neighbors and people from Buenavista BIR office.   I had a good time since i became a "sort of" model...for UKAY-UKAY? He he he he...not exactly what i had in mind whenever modelling comes into it...i would prefer to model laundry soap than Ukay-ukay, but as it happened, i was kinda having fun since almost all that they chose for me to wear fits me perfectly.   So, as Mama set aside some blouses and shirts for me and for her...we had a call from convent...reminding me of the practice i'll have with both COM and CCRM for the Alliance of the Two Hearts. About 12:15, Ma and I went home, grab somce lunch and i showered then took off for Church.  Yes, I was late...they were already there waiting for me and i was so glad that many were able to attend.  Practice started and everyone had fun, even the new ones who're not used to dancing. I was kinda wondering about some of my old animators...where the heck are those people!  About 5, i gave Father Ruel the DVD's that he ordered from me...and ordered again..."It Runs in The Family", "Kill Bill", "Williard", and "West Side Story".  Then, Tambok, Ma, Auntie Joy and I went to some houses for the solicitation for lights and decorations this Christmas that will be decorated in Church.   Around 6, Gemma already texted and we have to get back immediately for another Ukay moment...at sa awa ng Dios we got home shortly after 12 a.m. Ang saya-saya!!!   Me going to sleep now...

        Today...  Woke up at 4, but kinda disoriented so went back to sleep, and woke up at about 6:30, felt refreshed. While my MP3 is playing MY SONGS...my niece knocked on my door...telling me breakfast is served...What life!   Went down for breakfast and plugged on the Bad Boys Soundtrack on CD signaling the start of my new day.   Later this afternoon we'll be going to SMCC (St. Michael College of Caraga), my Alma Mater coz my nephew will have a contest. Hmmm...and probably grab some ice cream as a reward whether he wins or not.   Chin, i'm sorry about your cellphone, but just e-mail me when you have time, it's been a while. And yes...i received your e-card...it was really great...kinda reminded me of Lord of The Rings though.  Currently playing...Counter Strike...he he he he.  And listening to "Kahit Isang Saglit..."

      NIGHT...  A few minutes more and it’s past midnight…nope, I’m not having a difficult time sleeping, just not tired yet after the long nap I took early this afternoon.   For the past few days, I’ve been trying to understand why things happen. Whether they’re for a reason, or maybe there’s something planned for me. If life is what they say pre-destined, then whatever I do is already destiny. But then, God did gave us this power to decide for ourselves, whether we do it for better or for worse. That alone disprove of life as pre-destined.   Now, I realize that chances were given for me to grab hold of my life and what I want out of it, but, I lost my them. Life is just too short, who knows…by tomorrow I might not be here at all.   Just a feeling, I might not live a long life. Out of morbid curiosity, my morbid imagination run amok each time I travel, whether to Cabadbaran or to school, especially if the drivers are reckless…I imagine myself being flattened by the tires, or even by the vehicle itself…there’s blood everywhere. Oh well, I do have a really weird imagination which goes uncontrollable at times. If God is listening and watching, I do hope that when I leave this world, it wouldn’t be as bloody as I imagined.  Just out of morbid curiosity.

      Celelebration…Flu…Practice  It’s Christ the King…and I’m a bit under the weather…  Runny nose…sore throat…aching muscles = influenza  Heat is terrible and there’s a procession to be attended…neighbor’s son practice for his oratorical contest. My nephew’s poem recitation contest tomorrow…  Want to stay in bed and have a massage.  I’ll opt for playing Battle Realms…at least I get to expend energy and bent my upset on my enemies.  Reflex therapy tomorrow…report on Tuesday, no classes on Wednesday (closing of Ramadan) though I’ll be having practice with the COM apostolate. Thursday is another day of 7-7 classes and Friday spells boredom and Saturday, another day in paradise.

      WHAT A DAY...  First, i woke up at 4, i thought it was already 5 since i had a very restful sleep. Then was about to start chatting when my cellphone alarm went off...and reminded me that I have a lector serve at 6 am. Tsk...tsk...after i gulped some hot coffee...i changed for my uniform and went off to Church.  Then when i got back home at around 7, i was supposedly going to take a nap...or just a short rest, but, i had to help prepare the kids for their parade which started at promptly 8:30 after their thanksgiving mass...And at 9 i i had to attend the wedding which started so late by the way, that Fr. Ruel got really upset since the wedding ruined his schedule. Reminders: tell Ging Alita to have it discussed during pre-cana seminar.  My Mom and I got invited for lunch at the convent with both parish priest and vicar...BDW, Uncle Maning started the Church decorations for the upcoming Opening Salvo on Dec. 16 at 4 am.  I had my pedicure and manicure since i'll be judging a beauty pageant at 7 pm. We came home from the convent at 5 in the afternoon...i'm sooooo tired.  At 7, together with Ma and Auntie Rufa, we went to SMCC...and fortunately, the co-judges are friends of mine. Mimi and Gary...already booked a dance with Gary, but, Ma decided we get home early. So, after the pageant, we went home at around 10:30.  Now, i'm facing my monitor trying to write down the events of the past day...and now decided to take that well deserved sleep since 4 this morning.

      PRACTICE...  I just finished writing my report outline for next week's report...haaaay....at last i get to stretch my legs after 2 hours of just typing.   Got back choir practice at 9:30, and was able to sing Sana'y Wala Ng Wakas through the midi that i downloaded from the net. To everyone who helped me in trying to find the notes or the chords of the song, thanks!!!  Anyway, Father Dennis and Father Edgar called up...just to tell me they're leaving for Hawaii...hmmm...i bet in an hour they'd be there and will probably be exchanging "aloha's" with Father Hiwi.  Not much to say for today...oh well, there's always tomorrow.

        AMERICAN WEDDING...  Funny movie, albeit a little too visual/graphic for my usual taste, but then it's rated as sex comedy, so it's still acceptable. Weird film but with lesson...Love is not just an emotion, not just a feeling, but it sholud be done...Love is a work of art that takes the artist to different places and dimensions...but will remain as an art.

        GOODBYE...  Earlier today, we celebrated Father Dennis' birthday. It was one of the memorable moments in our lives since it was the first time that we were able to sing for him since he's always out of town when it's his birthday. It was also a tearful gathering since he'll be leaving for Hawaii this Thursday, and he caught a flight for Manila at 1:15 earlier in the afternoon.  We said goodbye to him though we tried our best not to shed anymore tears...we just couldn't help it. He's so much a part of our lives that it's kinda difficult that he just left and we won't be able to see him after 3 long years. I lost a confidant...a great friend...Though i gave him my e-mail and we'll probably chat after a while, it's still different that when he's around.  'Dre, I hope you'll have fun in Hawaii...wala say balikas karong panahona...we'll surely miss you and just keep in touch...tell Father Edgar to make a blog as well, just follow the instructions i wrote at the back of the card...and you'll never lose your way. Pray for me always...thanks...and we love you!

      AFTER THE PARTY...  It was such a tiring day. Non-stop action from 4:30 in the morning until 2 the next morning. Whew! Everyone had fun though, especially the kids who had their birthday party in the afternoon of Saturday. I wasn't there to witness it though since i had a meeting with the LECTORS' MINISTRY. Our meeting was so long, and stated another load of work for me as I am the secretary.  When I got home around 4:30 in the afternoon, the children's party was just about finish. And all i got were kisses from all of my pamangkins, and glad to see most of my cousins with their own toddlers. Kinda reminded me of some of my ideas of late.   Anyway, my pamangkins were so full of stories...(from all their gifts), and non-stop babbling about their games and their prizes. Their enthusiasm was infectious, it made me forget that my back's really aching and my hip throbbed from the badminton game I had earlier in school. Having them around made me re-think about some goals in life.   Well, the farewell party for Father Dennis started about 7:30. And as usual, Allan E. stole everyone's attention with his glittering "do" ala Celia Rodriguez...even Father Dennis was rendered speechless. Some pictures are due soon, and i'll leave the judging to all of you.  Even when my whole body's screaming for rest, songs from Ma's choir helped ease the tension. "Bisayan" kundiman managed to make my day, and reminded me of the times i spent with my Lola in the farm.   Oh well, it was a superb party with all the superb people, and a comfortable time where everybody enjoyed each other's company.  Father Dennis, bon voyage, good luck...and do well with your "pearly shells"...wait for me. And when you visit Grand Kapalua Hotel, please don't forget to send pictures. We'll surely miss you.

      CONCERNS...  After a night of restful sleep, i feel like i could take the world instride, then, the news from Kuwait just about made my day!   I'm blogging this at a cafe since i'm still here in Butuan waiting for my next class later at 1:30, what a bummer. This Saturday though, i'll be busy in the morning coz i have classes, then in the afternoon, i have a meeting with the lectors...then in the evening, we'll be having a blast once again...Tequila na sad!!!  Ate, if you're reading this, just pray na lang. I have already talked to Maam Ruffa, and everything will turn out ok in the end, just don't lose hope. You take care there and send my regards to Papa.

      PEARL HARBOR  I just finished watching “Pearl Harbor” shown in Star Movies, and once again I cried for the nth time. It was so heartbreaking, yet, it did remind me to always have hope despite insurmountable odds.   “Life is too short to be taken seriously.”   We should make time to experience all the things we haven’t done yet, or the time might catch up and unknowingly, we missed the chance to have done so.   Though this life taught me more than I’ve bargained, if given a chance to change some moments in my life, I wouldn’t erase one bit of moment I had. I had a little bit of everything, and nothing, still these things made me stronger, and tougher. Despite any other odds, I know that in the near future I’ll be able to face them and win.   Getting hurt and moving on, is part of the process of living. Like they said, “when you hit the bottom, there’s no way but up”. There might be times when I hoped I could have had a more peaceful and simpler life, but you never know what to expect.   Now, I know that I still have a long way to go, if ever God will bestow upon me a longer life. The only thing that would keep me going is the thought that everything happens for a reason, if I commit a mistake, then let it be an experience, if I love someone, then it’s destiny, if I get hurt, it was never meant to be…and if I do get married, it’s forever.

This saturday, my nieces and nephew will have their joint birthday celebration...these past few days have been hectic...no chance to chat, to time to scan...pure adrenaline rush in school and at home...then, there's work pressure...  I can't say that it's nice to be back...but i do love the welcome relief of getting pressured once again...kinda helped me in going to sleep...too tired to think.

      A TALE TO REMEMBER ME…  	The day will come when my body will lie upon a white sheet neatly tucked under the four corners of a mattress, located in a hospital busily occupied with the living and the dying. At a certain moment, a doctor will determine that my brain has ceased to function and that for all intents and purposes, my life has stopped. When that happens, do not attempt to instill artificial life into my body by the use of a machine. And don’t call this my deathbed. Let it be called the “Bed of Life”, and let my body be taken from it to help others lead fuller lives. Give my eyes (sight) to the man who has never seen sunrise, a baby’s face or love in the eyes of a woman. Give my heart to a person whose own heart has caused nothing but endless days of pain. Give my blood to the teenager who was pulled from the wreckage of his car, (so that he might live to see his grandchildren play). Give my kidneys to one who depends on a machine to exist from week to week. Take my bones, every muscle, every fiber and nerve in my body and find a way to make a crippled child walk. Explore every corner of my brain. Take my cells, if necessary, and let them grow, so that someday a speechless boy will shout at the crack of a bat and a deaf girl will hear the sound of rain falling against her window. Burn what is left of me and scatter the ashes to the winds to help the flowers grow.   	If you must bury something, let it be my faults, my weaknesses and all prejudice against my fellowmen.  	Give my sins to the devil. Give my soul to God.  	If, by chance, you wish to remember me, do with a kind deed or word to someone who needs  your love.  	If you do all I have asked, I shall live forever.

      ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT  As I prepare myself to sleep, I kept staring at the stars blinking at me, and the moon in all her glory was beckoning me to sit beside the window and watch her, somehow, carried with invisible hands, I came to sit by the window and just stared at the glowing sky.   Then came the eerie silence that seemed to whisper in its wake, I don’t know what happened but I felt the goose bumps all over again.   Just to separate my mind from all the horror its trying to conjure, I welcomed the voice of Josh Groban as he sang in my DVD. Again, I was in love.   His rendition of “Broken Vow” reminded me always of Mindoro, not that there was a person in Mindoro who broke some vow, but of the stillness of the sea in Ensalada, and the breathtaking beauty of the place and its inhabitants. Whenever I need a place to recuperate from all the stress, I think of Puerto Galera and of the things I experienced there. From way back in UP-Manila when we had our emersion in “Gale”, then of our escapades when we joined the Remontados.   Hay naku Chin, those were the glorious days we shared together…remember Charlie? I wonder what happened to him, he’s probably taking his Masters Degree abroad…what do you think? Text me if ever Grace contacts you…and of course Angge. Asan na kaya ang bruha?  Well, I just hope that we’ll be able to do those excursions again, maybe in a year I could grab some time off from school, maybe during affiliation, before going back here to the province we could go straight to Puerto Galera, even for a couple of days. And of course, bring Francis…pwede ba naming hindi.  I do wonder sometimes, what could have happened if I stayed there and gotten a job in Manila…hmmm…that’s a thought.

      FREEDOM  After being confined in strong emotions so strong these past few weeks...i managed to be freed from all of it yesterday. I was so uptight that I blurted out all my feelings for this person. I didn't know what got into me. But even if it was really shameful, i was somehow exhilirated because I was free. Still, i didn't get to sleep well last night.  You know me...and i'm still learning more about you, i just want to thank you for not laughing at me, it really meant a lot.  Hope you have a safe trip to San Francisco and take care.

      WHO UNDERSTANDS MEN?   The nice men are UGLY!  The handsome men are not NICE!  The handsome and nice men are GAY!  The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married!  The men that are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are only after their money!  The handsome men without money are after our money!  The handsome men who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, don’t think we are beautiful enough!  The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual, somewhat nice and have money are cowards!  The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and thank God are heterosexuals are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!   The men who never make the first move, automatically loses interest in us when we make the first move!  Now, who in world can understand men?

      Today we’re celebrating All Saint’s Day. Ma and her choir are going to sing in Triangulo Cemetery for the 4 pm mass, I’d be there of course, together with my pamangkins, and most probably meet up with my cousins once more. I just hope everything will turn out OK.  It might rain, but, honestly, I prefer the rain, than the heat…  Oh. JCR texted...i wished we could have met too...but don't worry, we still have next time to look forward to...i just hope it will be soon.

       MELODRAMAS...   For the past couple of days, i caught myself watching melodramatic, feel-good, Tagalog movies...which is by the way...a very weird moment since i don't watch Filipino movies at all cause i think they're just too predictable. Maybe i'm caught in the Valentine web...still, i really don't think it's that it...since i've spent every Valentine for the past 3 years alone.   Hmmm...first, i watched "Till There Was You", then "Kailangan Kita" and now, i finished watching "Ngayong Nandito Ka"...and to top it all off...I cried.   Huh!!! This is really getting weird...this ruins my reputation...:-) Nga Chin, sobra!!! This is not me at all Brum...must be catching something really, really toxic...  Anyways, i'll be updating my Blogs maybe this week...or the next...or next month...

       MY EULOGY...   Just last Sunday, my Uncle, Mom's brother in-law passed away...shocking us since his death was an untimely blow...for his family and for Kinabjangan.  Uncle Jorge, as I fondly called him, was the person who introduced me to my current Boss and adviser. He wanted me to follow his footsteps and wanted to mold me into becoming a politician someday. Dili nako malikayan nga mahinumduman kadtong mga panahon nga iya kong hangyoon nga mag-emcee…every time, kung iya nang panahon sa pag-sulti, akong linya mao gyud ang…”walay pabor-pabor, akong Uyu-an, pinalanggang Kapitan sa barangay.”  He led our barangay for as long as I can remember...when I was still in high school, he was already the Barangay Captain and until his death, he's still the Father of our small barrio...  He may have had his shortcomings, but he was only human. He also commits mistakes...still those mistakes were compensated with the goodness of his heart and the sincerity in his job. He may have been a lot of things, but, I can safely say, he wasn’t corrupt, kay kung corrupt pa ang akong uyo-an, dako na unta siya ug balay, sin na unta ug konkreto.   Apan, sa gisulti pa, ang mga tawo, kung pakit-on sa bond paper nga puti, dili man makakita sa kaputi-on kung dili didto man sa puntik nga gamay. He had projects for Kinabjangan that will never be forgotten, like the gym, and the barangay hall. Dili sad siya mamorhisyo sa nakataas pa sa iya nga dali-dalion ang iyang mga proyekto kay tungod daghan pa daw mas dakong problema sila, whether it’s the mayor, the governor or the Congressman.   My Uncle is a great man! If not for his diabetes, daghan pa kaayo siya plano…pero, kinahanglan na sad daw niyang magpahulay kay gitawag na siya.    His death brought tears in our eyes...and the feeling of emptiness always comes through, yet, I’m sure he's glad he finally found his peace since he was already suffering greatly from diabetes...and getting tired of all the hassles of being the Barangay Captain after the amputation of his right leg.  Those were trying times for him, yet he remained a stalwart figure of leadership in Kinabjangan, and even though he already stood up on his prosthetic leg, albeit unsteadily...his calming presence makes everything run smoothly.  Uncle, you've left us with your legacy...may you find peace at last in the arms of our Creator...you will always be in our hearts...remembered...missed...and loved...till time and times are gone.

       LAST VIGIL   Later today we'll be going to my Uncle's last vigil together with my Grandmothers who cam just for this.   We've missed you Uncle, there's no doubt about that...but we'll have all the memories that we've shared, and whenever we need to relive them again, they're always on hand.  I've met some of my classmates getting our documentation ready for submission since it's already signing of our clearance for the most part nest week. Some teachers are willing to give their final exams next week though, so we need to get this done, just so we could extend our vacation much longer.   Summer classes will start again on the 12th of April and on the 15th i'll be going to Bohol together with my co-lectors until the 18th of April. (I'm crossing my fingers that I'll be excused)  Today, i'm feeling a bit groggy...the late nights that I had simply came back haunting me. I need to get some sleep...Argh!!  And tomorrow, i've arranged the necro in the gym and in church...hopefully,everyone will come.

       ANOTHER SAD DAY...   Just last Sunday, my Uncle, Mom's brother in-law passed away...shocking us since his death was an untimely blow...for his family and for Kinabjangan.  Uncle Jorge, as i fondly called him, was the person who introduced me to my currrent Boss and adviser. He wanted me to follow his footsteps and wanted to mold me into becoming a politician someday. He made me run for President of Kinabjangan Women's League so that I could lead the women of our Barangay at a young age. I won as President even if I was the youngest among them, maybe because of my own skills but, always with the support of my Uncle.  I have told him once that I won't get into politics since the most unscrupulous of men belonged in politics...but, he also made me see that there are still some politicians who are honest and service-oriented.   He lead our barangay for as long as I can remember...when i was still in highshool, he was already the Barangay Captain and until his death, he's still the Father of our small barrio...  He may have had his shortcomings, but he was only human. He also commit mistakes...still those mistakes were compensated with the goodness of his heart and the sincerity in his job.

God is really great...may they rest in peace.

       THE PLACE THAT IS…BOHOL   I didn’t know that my Father’s place has full of surprises in store for me. I went there expecting to be bored out of my mind, and yet, excited to be there together with a different crowd.   Joining the Lectors’ Ministry might have been the best thing I did way back last year, but there were surely times that I regretted being one. It’s not because of the Ministry itself but with some of my co-lectors that are nothing but hypocrites and “orocan”…as in. I’m not saying I’m better than them, but, one thing I am not, is pretend that I’m religious…nor a devout Catholic.   As I prepared my things the night before our departure for Bohol, I was anxious to see my grand ‘rents again…and my cousins whom I rarely see, yet they make me feel welcome. I know that in Loon, I’ll be having a grand time with the family, but, what will I do in Tagbilaran where we were to have our “Holy Retreat”? Reflect? Recollect? Rest?   On my way to the assembly area, I was gripped with sudden attack of unrest…and always in a hurry. Maybe because I spent hours in Butuan when I should have been home relaxing and awaiting the hour of departure…instead, I was hard pressed with calls and text messages from the President, officers and members of the Ministry. Argh!! And when I went to get the streamer, the not-so-polite girl told me that I have to wait for another hour since it’s still wet…Argh! So, as not to get mad and stomp my feet in exasperation, I went to Keysa’s and in an impulse, I bought a Capri, and then went to E&L Music and Sports Shop to buy my guitar.   Got the guitar tucked safely in its case and before going to the terminal, I went back to the streamer and got it then went to the bus terminal for home…that’s about 11:15.  12:35 p.m. the Pres kept asking where I’m at since I have to be at the assembly area earlier than the suggested time…Waaaaah!!! Ang kulit nyo rin!!!   12:50 p.m. AT LAST!!! Got to the assembly area, arranged some of the paperwork needed for the trip, and met some members who just paid their dues at the last minute…  “kalami ba jud dili paubanon…”, but, it’s not my call, besides, it would be really fun to have them all in Bohol since most of them are first timers…  Well, at 1:45, the last batch of the Ministry headed for the pier with Msgr. Bienvenido A. Betaizar just in time for the ship to leave. Everyone’s having fun…including my Mom…and as usual, she had so many snacks with her even “tambis” she brought along with her…hmmm…  Anyway, I fell asleep on the ship and woke up just in time for the men asking me to have my guitar taken from its case and played. Songs were played and sung and almost everyone joined in. Pictures were taken and smiles were exchanged…  Well, here goes Bohol…pictures are going to be posted later…

       “I’LL GO…”   2 words…  Hurting words, I remember.  And now, after a year, I heard them again. The silence is palpable, it’s deafening. I wonder sometimes, if you do consider me as your friend, for I felt I’m only an acquaintance gate crashing in a party. For a year, I’ve known you, there was only a few times I felt the closeness of friends. If I am jaded, so are you. I didn’t know you’re insensitive, because I don’t usually receive the brunt of it. But now it seems that the arrows are aimed at me, and it shoots quite accurately.   I am not one to be so harsh in judgments, because God knows I am a sinner, or even a perennial pain in the neck to Him, still, I know I deserve better than what you’ve shown me. It’s hurting, and I’m hurt…true, and if that’s the only way you can treat me, I don’t think I can continue being a friend to you.   My mind may only be provincial compared to yours, you’ve reached the peak of educational success, and who am I but a lone  “probinsiyana”  who only had a glimpse of the real world. I may not be as sophisticated as everyone else is, but I know I have a good heart, and I can be sincere if I want to and when I want to.   But, judge me if my mistakes include meeting you.

       MY DAY…   I didn’t quite get the sleep I think I deserve last night. But, it seems that lately I have been having “tulog-manok” for reasons I like to keep to myself. Blogging, I think would be a big help for me, if only I have the determination to write. If I had been a writer, this would be what they call  “writer’s   block”,  which I can’t really comprehend, if this means mental block or the block where a writer lives. Oh well, I’d like to call this temporary block as… temporary dementia .   As I happen to scan through old things, I was caught again in the drama of my life. It’s not as if my life is “teleserye-worthy”, but it does have its perks and frustrations, just like a “teleserye bitin moment”. I believe, I’m still in the stage where I want to be pleased, not because I am primadonna-ish, but it’s because I got used to wait up and please people that now, I want to put a stop to that and want my turn, just this once.    Am I selfish? I don’t think so. Is it bad that I just want a little bit of their time? I want to feel their presence. I just want to feel them. As I stare at the blank wall in front of me, vivid imaginations come to life, which I believe would lead to a disturbing image that would lead again to the destruction of a good thing.  What am I saying? Oh well, blame it on the dementia I’m experiencing now. My turn is yet to come. I’m still young and I’m not in a hurry to settle down and be among the rational…or is it the other way around? Haaay! I am a bit jaded, and careful, but one cannot be too careful, because I tend to trust easily, which often than not, result to catastrophe. Such dire predictions would surely bring the negative vibes swarming around me. Yet, hope is just a glimpse away, not too unreachable, still hovering close by.   I just hope I won’t fall too fast and feel too hard…I just might break.

      100 YEARS  I’m 15 for a moment Caught between 10 and 20 And I’m just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are.  I’m 22 for a moment She feels better than ever And we’re on fire Making our way back from Mars.  15…there’s still time for you Time to buy and time to lose 15… There’s never a wish better than this When you only get a 100 years to live.  I’m 33 for a moment Still the man but you see I’m a they A kid on the way A family on my mind  I’m 45 for a moment The sea is high And I’m heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life.  15…There’s still time for you Time to buy and time to lose yourself Within a morning star.  15… I’m alright with you 15…There’s never a wish better than this  When you only got a 100 years to live.  Halftime goes by Suddenly you’re wise Another blink of an eye 67 is gone The sun is getting high We’re moving on…  I’m 99 for a moment Dying for just another moment And I’m just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are.  15… There’s still time for you 22… I feel her too 33… You’re on the way Every day’s a new day.  15… There’s still time for you Time to buy and time to choose Hey 15… There’s never a wish better than this When you only got a 100 years to live.

       WORDS FAIL ME…   It has been a while since I’ve updated my blog. It’s not because I’ve been busy with some things that I could not attend to this, but, words fail me. I have attempted many times; unfortunately, I lack the inspiration to write. I no longer have the drive to play with words like I used to, nor do I have intense emotions about some thing. I am just idle.   Even now, I turned on the AC since it is soooo hot in here the past few days, and I’m currently listening to disco music so I won’t be tempted to lie back in bed and sleep.  Sleep…the only thing I have been doing lately, well, except for my afternoon badminton play. ?   But, my day started great though since I’ve chatted with a good friend of mine whom I haven’t seen for a while, on the net, I mean. He’s pestered me about my blog or my lack there of. Hehehe. As if he’s updating his.   Photography…one of my favorite past times, but, I lack the gadgets. Now it seemed it’s his hobby…and the shots he took were…ehem…MTRCB R-18…hehehe. But like he said, it’s all for the sake of art. :-D Mukha mo!!! I know I am no expert on photography, but for an amateur like him, he certainly passed the test for his shots were good, albeit rated. Bwahaha.   Oh well, the shots I took in Bohol aren’t as vivid as his, but, they’re wholesome and family-oriented. Hehehe. I really miss chatting with this guy since he always manages to challenge my fighting spirit, and never a bore to talk to. The problem is, he’s just too busy with his nth businesses that he lacks ample time with some of his friends. Like me, for example. ?  Anyway, till my next blog. And the Bohol pics aren’t scanned yet, tinatamad akong pumuntang Butuan, so that means, they’re still unavailable. Thanks for the great conversation earlier, kinda missed the challenge. Till later.

       ON MY OWN...   And now i'm all alone again, nowhere to turn, no one to go to Without a home, without a friend, without a face to say hello to And now the night is near and I can make believe he's here  Sometimes I walk alone at nightwhen eveybody else is sleeping I think of him and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping The city goes to bed, and I can live inside my head.   On my own, pretending he's beside me All alone, i've walked with him till morning Without him, I feel his arms around me And when I lose  my way, I close my eyes And he has found me.  In the rain the pavement shines like silver,  All the lights are misty in the river In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me forever and forever.  And I know it's only in my mind That i'm talking to myself and not to him And although I know that he is blind Still I say, there's a way for us.  I love him, but when the night is over He is gone, a river's just a river Without him, the world around me changes The trees are bare and everywhere The streets are full of strangers.  I love him, but everyday I'm learning All my life I've only been pretending Without me, his world would go on turning A world that's full of happiness that I have never known.  I love him I love him I love him But only on my own.  Performed by: Kuh Ledesma on Duets with Kuh

       MY FATE…   Do you believe in fate? Kismet, perhaps?   I, for one believe that everything is not pre-destined. What I do with my present life will result to what could happen in the future. But, there are times when I believe that everything happened because it’s already been written somewhere. Still, I wonder what that book could be and where does it rests?   Lately, things have not been favorable to me. I haven’t done anything that could jeopardize the one thing I am careful of, but, it seems like I’m heading to another catastrophe. You know, this “gut” feeling some people talk about, is really true. No matter how hard I try to deny it, there’s just something scary about “gut” feeling, because it really blows you hard.   I know I tend to self-destruct, but, I’ve done nothing. I mean, maybe before, I lost my chances in happiness because I self-destruct, but, what happened now? I wonder. Were all these, just trials to test me out, on how strong I can get, or how tough am I even when “the wind howls”.   Come on…help me out here. Don’t leave me in the dark! Confess all! I am tired of assuming and presuming…just come out clean and be honest. I may have been a lot of things, but I don’t think I deserve this. I won’t beg you. All I ask is your honesty.

        a rough day...but the sun still shines... Didn't get any sleep at all since i was awake until 3 a.m., then woke up around 5 because i forgot to charge my phone. Not a good start. Ranting? Not really, but grouchy since i woke up so early from so little sleep. No flu anymore, but a terrible headache. Anyway, I did well on my exams and i just received the good news that my endorsement for scholarship will be pushed through next school year. (Thank You, Lord!) After last night, i think i need and early trip to bed...but, i can't! I have to practice for the choir and rest most probably a little later. Oh well, still nursing a terrible headache and in depression mode...Hope things will be better tomorrow...

        A little bit of me... To start with, i heard of Blog from a good friend of mine who assured me that this is good for ranting and raving at the same time. Well, i'm working for a Congressman in our place and studying nursing at the same time, hoping to land in a job in the States. Anyway, about my day, it's not really good since i'm nursing a flu and woke up late...but then, when i logged on, i saw JR, the good friend who never misses a chance to make me smile. Hope that i'll be able to rest later and able to study tonight for exams tomorrow. I'm starting to feel better...till next time...

        I AM A WOMAN IN LOVE...  Hehehehe! Well, despite the fact that it's terribly late since it's already 2:45 a.m. from my watch, i'm having a hard time sleeping. Anyway, i'm just so happy today, not because i'm literally IN-LOVE, but, i just found some way to cope up with this bug in my heart, and somehow, help it discover true feelings and worth. Hmmm...love the song though..."I am a woman in love, and I'd do anything to get you into my world...and hold you within..."Enough of this madness, first and foremost, i would like to say thanks to the person/persons who created this BLOGGER net because this is so relaxing...:-) JCR, hey! I hope you have a safe trip to Seattle and good luck! Brum, thanks for the text earlier, i'm sorry i wasn't able to reply since, i was sooooooo busy.  For everyone's information...Brumhilda is my best friend who's now in UP-Los Banos...and i call her Brumhilda... You know what, i think i'd better sleep now, i could  hear some weird sounds from my window, and it's pretty scary...Till next time...Babushka!!!

Don't want to write anymore...i'm done.One more thing though, after the homily i heard from Church, i've never been more confused in my life...and no depressions now...i'm done with th carbo-loading and choco-craving! YEEEEESSS! But i have a very pounding headache...why do women have to suffer this PMS?Argh! But then, given the choice, given a chance to choose if i want to become a man or a woman, i still would have preferred to be a woman...Love being me! :-)

        Just got back from Church, i had a good day. Eventhough i slept late, i had a very restful sleep, so, i'm ok. Had lunch with Rev,. Fr. Dennis and Fr. Ruel, had a few laughs, and somehow enjoyed lunch. It's very hot though, i doubt i'd be able to take a nap when i get home. Again, thanks to JCR, i'm back to Blog, and having a good time. I'll probably study this afternoon, then back to Church at 5. Hmmm....i love the song being played...there's this certain song banging in my head all day yesterday until early this morning, i couldn't get the title, but i seem to like the song. Weird, since it's a Filipino song. Anyway, hopefully, later tonight i'll be able to get it right. Oh well, no exciting news for me...Gotta go, i need to change my bed sheets already, and clean up my room. Thank God it's nearing vacation time...Brumhilda, here I come...

        I know it's been almost 3 days since i updated this Blog, well, thanks to Mr. JCR i'm back. Another tiring day, stuck up printing songs, left alone at home..one thing uplifted my spirit though, i watched Boys and Girls and Freddie Prinze was just awesome and yummy...(as usual)But then Claire got him..argh! Bummer! Hmm...i miss my bestfriend who's in LB right now, (Brum, i know you'll be reading this later on), i really miss our escapades in college. How comforting it would be just to spend it watching latest great movies abd then hang out at the Park...(lam mo na yun..) Mom arrived late...from Church, a little bit disappointed since i ordered some food...not even pizza..argh! Spent the rest of the evening finishing up all the printing jobs left for me. And listen to songs from the James Taylor, Bread, Michael Johnson to Linkin Park, Smashing Pumpkins, Blink and Goo Goo Dolls then to Parokya ni Edgar, Side A, Freestyle then Rivermaya.  Then, logged on at around way past midnight and got to chat with the person who showed me the way back to BLOG... I wonder...how much Blogger is paying JCR for this...hehehehehe Just a thought!
