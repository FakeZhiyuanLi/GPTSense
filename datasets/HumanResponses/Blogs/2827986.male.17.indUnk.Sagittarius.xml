           There is a certain bliss after having just shaved your legs. I myself am very aquainted with the elation one feels when rubbing two freshly shorn, just out of the shower legs together.  At first I didn't know that frivilous joy that girls have the day they shave. Rather, I thought it silly.  I decided to give it a shot, why not? My razor, a Gillette Mach 3, mowed over the hair, leaving behind a slick surface.  When I was done, voila! Pristine, smooth, girl legs.       However, there is more than shaving other than aesthetic (though that does have a major part). Most men do not know the tedious task of shaving your legs, so they dismiss it. After all it's only shaving. This was my train of thought for the longest time until I actually started.  What a pain in the ass.  First there is the process of positioning yourself in the shower, so that the foam from shaving gel doesn't wash off. Then, there are ankles and knees. Although these are very important parts of the body, I hate them. Being as that I'm rather scrawny, my achilles tendon is more defined. Let me tell you right here and now, there is nothing more alienating than dragging a razor across a very important tendon.       After the actual shaving is done, there's the issue of maintenence. After my shower, I put lotion on my legs. This helps my legs remain smooth and I hear it makes the hair grow back slower. However, it doesn't grow back slow enough.  Every two days, I shave my legs, so they can maintain the ungodly smoothness. Every two days, I sit in the most awkward position in my shower, lather my legs, and pull the three blades across the stubbly surface, praying for no razor burn.       But why do this if involves that much work?  I do it for two reasons, to better understand women, and I love the feeling of having just shaved my legs. Although I am gay, women fascinate me to no end. Truely women are the most complicated creatures to understand on this planet. Women go through so much pain and time just to look what we have deemed "presentable." Don't believe me? Go shave your legs, then take time to do your hair, makeup, and pluck your eyebrows while your at it. If you want you can even get a bikini wax! So, to better understand the elegant tribulations women go through, I decided to sample what they go through. No, I don't wear makeup, I don't wax my bikini area, and I definately do not wear high heels.         Of course, the other reason I shave is because for me.  I love how my legs look without hair. Although my legs are quite skinny, the calf muscle is quite defined. That is one of my favorite parts of the body, the calf muscle. How it curves so gently when relaxed and becomes so quickly rigid when flexed. Legs are very beautiful things, but I digress.  My legs are so wonderful looking when their shaved, and so smooth, like marble.  Women, I more or less know your pain. What power beauty has over people.   urlLink    Like Bunny Yeager here, legs are important to one's self image.  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      We all have to say goodbye to someone at some point in time.  Give them your love, wave your hand, and wave goodbye.  There are times when the goodbye is permanent, and that person becomes a warm memory.  One of those memories that pulls your heartstrings like a marionette puppet.  I have several memories with Kit.       I met Kit in seventh grade PE.  This funny blond girl turns to me and introduces herself without any particular worry that I could be mean (although I wasn't and am not still). Immediately we laughed as though we've known one another for ages.  Our laughter got to be a problem, so the PE teacher moved her to the other side of the line, away from me.  Apparently I wasn't the only one who found Kit, or Kitten as I now knew her, funny, so Ms. Valdez (the PE teacher) moved her back to me.        My fondest, happiest, warmest memories with Kitten were at summer school.  Being the only girl in the class, she sought me as a guardian against the hormonal boys in the class. Again our laughter got us in trouble. Not surprisingly, the teacher moved Kit to a different seat, so some serious note passing went on.  Again, our laughter could be heard in the class.  Realizing that his separation was futile, the teacher "reunited" Kitten and myself.       Saying goodbye to Kit was one of the hardest moments in my life. Yes, I have dealt with death before, it was my grandfather and my uncle. However, my grandfather was 75 and had lived a happy, wonderful life. My uncle got HIV, which lead to AIDS, and to his death. These deaths were painful, but things were different with Kitten. Kit was only 16 and she got in an car accident. It was too fast, she was too young. Most of those 16 years were spent in high school too, so she never got to see what the world had in store for her.  Kit will never to go to her prom, or graduation. I can't laugh with her anymore and she can't laugh with me. It was a goodbye that was about the equivilent of having a knife in my very soul.       The time we have here is short, so there are two ways of spending it. Although Kit was only here for 16 years, she made the best of it. Her glass was never half empty or half full, it was constantly overflowing with happiness, laughter, love, and Dance Dance Revolution.  How are you going to spend your short time here? I make the most out of my life.  My glass, like Kit's, is overflowing.  urlLink    Kit with some lotion, so silly.  Posted by  urlLink Hello

           We met in kindergarten, I'm not sure what our first words to one another were, but that hardly matters.  He name is Isabel and she is everything to me. If there is a top priority of mine, it is her and her well being. She is basically my sister from another mister.  If ever there is a shoulder to cry on, it is hers. Isabel uses compassion to dry my tears and tender hugs to warm me when I feel cold.  My love for her is like a thornless rose; gentle, beautiful, and stronger through the menial conflicts.       Isabel plays guitar and has a feathery soft voice that trickles through my ears and permeates in my head.  Her songs are those of life and all the things life presents us with. The songs are those of Truths, things we can all relate to at one point or another in our lives. Sometimes, to be honest, I don't hear the lyrics. I only hear that seraph's voice coming from this blond California angel. There are times when I hear her songs and I cry like a second grader who lost at two-square.        After our last year of high school, we will be going to Italy, and I can't think of a better person to go with.  We can look at each other and laugh so hard that even Nutella comes out of our noses.  I can imagine how it will be there with her.  I have actually had very vivid dreams of drinking coffee with her. We are going to have the best time that can possibly be had by two human beings. How divine our time will be! And how presumptuous I'm being!         If there is a God, I do thank him/her every night for such a friendship. It is rare someone has a friend who sticks with them for so long. It's a bigger rarity some dramatic shit hasn't come between us. However dramatic though, Isabel and I will always remain best of friends. Now I know that is frightfully presumptous, but it is the truth. Even though I am only 17 and have my whole life to make new friends, Isabel will always be with me.

       urlLink    Marilyn&nbsp; urlLink        If you haven't realized this already, get out of your cave. This is Marilyn Monroe, or Norma Jean, to those who knew her best.  Her story is the typical Hollywood Homicide story. Poor girl grows up with big dreams, which are eventually a reality. Although we can only see the smile on her red, red lips, there was pain underneath all that glamour, which was shielded from our eyes.      Marilyn was the very image of sexiness, vulnerability, and sadness. She was only something to look at in film, not something to be understood. Certainly nothing to listen to. That's what probably did her in, not being listened to.  She had so much to say and so much to learn.  All of that disregarded, we just wanted movies with that vuluptuous, platinum Venus. That whispery voice was ignored, but not by all. She may be dead, but I listen. I can't even begin to fathom the chaos that was her life, but for that I'm greatful.       Happy Birthday Norma Jean. You deserve a happy something.
