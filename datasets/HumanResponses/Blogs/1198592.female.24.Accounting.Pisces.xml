       True Heroes  Seeing the soldiers take their stand last Sunday was both horrific, inspiring and sad.  Horrific because they had managed to turn a city known for being “safe” as far as safe can be, into the base of operations for a rebellion, even if it is only an attempted one.  Who would have thought that the business sector would be the victim of inter-government war?  But such is the state of life that things we never thought would happen, will.  It was inspiring because here is actual proof of people who really cared.  Real patriots.  Being from the metropolis, I don’t really have a high opinion of soldiers or cops, since the Mindanao war seem so far removed and the soldiers I do see are corrupt.  At least most of them.  But here are people who really cared.  Who are wiling to die for the country.  Their sacrifice, albeit not necessarily done in the method most people would agree with, is still that… a sacrifice.  To see that there are people who are keeping me safe, safe enough to not even know the truth of what they do, is inspiring and humbling at the same time.  It is sad because these same people, whose patriotism has been proven, will go down.  Or we will have to face a nation in chaos.  And I wish I could say, let the nation go to chaos as long as these people can succeed, but the truth is I can’t.  I’m too pragmatic to do it and still idealistic enough to want to.  I can only hope that the nation does learn a lesson today.  That people do care.  And its about time we give a damn.

       A Little Faith   Due to astronomically good (or bad, depending on the perspective taken) timing, hard work and divine intervention, I have now earned for myself a chance to prove my worth and even probably get myself promoted to the next level in my firm’s corporate hierarchy.  This is what I had set for myself to do when I started working, just a little over a year ago.  And to achieve this, despite the  unexpectedness  of the news, should have made me ecstatic.  But I’m not.  Instead, I am afraid.  Very afraid.  This fear is not like any that I have gone through in my life.  It’s not a fear that you know will happen, so it is more of anticipation and dread that you actually feel.  It’s not a fear that you know  won’t  happen, so it is more of just second guessing yourself and your environment.  It’s not even a fear that you won’t achieve what you have set and committed yourself too, so much so that you end up merely fearing to become a champion of mediocrity.  No, this fear is far worse than that.  It is a fear of failing  miserably .  The most unforgivable failure in my book.  Arrogance aside, for once in my life, I don’t know if I could do the responsibilities given to me.  And I don’t know if I can’t either.  The state of unknowing and the great many possibilities that dwell there, scares me to almost immobility.  I want to run away, I want more time, I want to be ready.  But even then I know that space and time won’t really prepare me for this.  This time, I’ll just have to take a leap of faith.  I’ll have to be strong, to show no hesitation and to believe that I actually know what I’m doing.  But still, a little voice in me inside questions my integrity.  For if I don’t know if I can do it, to pretend and act as if I can, would that not be a lie?  A deception based on forced faith in my capabilities and an intelligence that refuses to let anyone else know that it doubts.  And yet, there seems to be no other “ right ” way.

       A little Prayer    Lord, let me be brave. And let me, while I craft my tales, be wise. Let me say true things in a voice that's true, and, with the truth in mind, let me write lies.   I found this quote/prayer extremely intresting.  Appropriately enough, it came from a writer acquaintance.  I think I shall pray this often...

       Blog Baptism   A new blog... a new life... maybe, maybe not.  I chose to celebrate what may be my last few days in my client with whom I have been with for the past 2 months, by studying html.  At least as far as it could get me in customizing my blog.  It's a solemn occasion, since I know that back in the office, I won't have such a liberal access to the Net.  Hence, my blogging days and customizing days (short though it may be) seems to be coming to an end.  At the same time, I will have to say goodbye to the kind of work I have here.  A boring, non-challenging work that actually allowed me to have a life, a fact I wasn't aware of until I came to this client.  Going out on weekdays, playing on internet cafes and seeing people I love on a daily basis have become addictive.  And while I will still see them, and while I'm not exactly sad to leave the " work " behind, it just won't be the same.  What's waiting for me outside this little world I have built (ok, so I'm starting on my melodrama, forgive me) are more responsibilities sans the benefits (defined as pay increase), less internet and subordinates who are intimidated by a false title given to me due to desperation.  All of these things I actually found appealing at one point in time.  But now... I just dread it.  It's like going to the dentist.  You know it's good for your career in the long run, but it's going to be painful.  And so I started a new blog.  One that actually was customized to my taste.  It's not beautiful and award winning, but it is a start.  I hope I can return to this self-tutorial of mine and improve this site even more.  Realistically though, all I can hope for is a chance to post every now and then and make small changes which hopefully would add up and make me, if no one else, say one day, " wow, I did that ?".  So to my lunch and dinner buddies  urlLink Alex  and urlLink  Jay , you know I'll miss you like crazy (yes, the late eighties, early nineties song) and all I can hope for is another chance to do this thing again.  Wish me luck people.

       My Fairy Tale   Just this morning, I read this nice, a little bittersweet essay about “ the one that got away ”.  Here are some choice excerpts:   Who is the one that got away? I guess it's that person with who everything was great, everything was perfect, but the timing was just wrong. There was no fault in the person, there was no flaw in the chemistry, but the cards just didn't fall the right way, I suppose.  How often have you gone through it without even realizing it? When you're not ready to commit in that mature manner, it doesn't matter who you're  with, it just doesn't work. Small problems become big; inconsequentials become dealbreakers simply because you're not ready and it shows. It's not that you and the person you're with are no good; it's just that it's not yet right, and little things become the flashpoint of that fact.  What do you do if it's not yet too late? Simple...find him, find her. Because the very existence of a "one that got away" means that you'll always wonder, what if you got that one?  You might drop in from out of nowhere and it won't make a difference. If the timing is finally right, it'll all just fall into place somehow and you know, I'm thinking, it would be a great feeling, in the end, to be able to say to someone, "Hey you, you're the one that almost got away."   I don’t know.    While there are some things about that I agree with the author, there are also some other things that I don’t.  The fairy tale ending seem exactly that… too much of a fairy tale for me.  I do believe that timing plays an important role in a relationship.  I should know, I was a victim of its harsh constraints.  But when you do become ready, when time is less cruel and life seems clearer than it was, wouldn’t that mean you have changed?  And that change, no matter how slight or how gradual it was, still makes you undeniably different… with undeniably different needs and wants.    So the chemistry was great… then.  So the person was perfect… then.  So it seemed that the only problem of the relationship was you… then.  It doesn’t change the fact that a million things could have happened while you are on the road to enlightened maturity, not only on your end but on the  person-who-got-away’s  end as well.  And to expect that everything will remain the same, just like in the movies, while you correct that minute malfunction in your system is a little too idealistic for my taste.  I am more of a firm believer of a different kind Fate-inspired romance.  I believe that if 2 people are really meant for each other, than they will constantly make that decision to love each other for the rest of their lives.   And if you are mature enough to make that decision a sincere one in the first place, than there wouldn’t  be  a person who got away in your life.  There will only be that person beside you, whom you will care for, grow up and old with and most of all, love till the end of time.

       Tinge of Goodbye   His kiss tasted lemon-sweet.  The car interior seemed oddly unchanged.  I heard the music drip in the background, felt the whispers of the soft seat covers, smelled the scent of pine that lightly gilded the air.  And still the kiss continued like a shallow-deep conversation, where the participants search for something theoretically should be there.  I felt him pull me closer, as if to hold on. I felt myself respond, half due to courtesy, the other because I still sincerely felt something.  And even as the slow beginnings of passion started to ignite, a million things began to fight for my attention:  the gear shift against my thigh, the flickering lights outside the car, the fact that I still had work to do at home.  I wanted to scream “STOP!” to the onslaught of mundanity that dared to interfere just when affection and lust have come to make its appearance.  But it didn’t stop.  I found myself running my hand through his back, because I knew he expected it.  I began to play with his tongue and to taste the pleasant mix of pizza and beer because I knew that was the next move.  I made the necessary murmurs and moans because to not do so would be impolite.  And then the kiss stopped.  He took a deep breath.  I took mine.  He smiled, an oh-so-familiar smile.  “I love you Anne.  Goodnight.”  At that point I knew.  I knew without a doubt that he remembers too, what it was like.  And I knew he can see clearly what it is now.  “I love you too.”  I said, playing the game.  There would be time for goodbye soon enough.  Not now though, now, there was still something to hold on to.  An affection that has not eroded, a dance that has not been finished, a kiss that has not completely lost its sweetness.  But goodbye would be inevitable.  After all, you can only remember up to a certain extent, hold on for a certain period of time.  I took another dose of reality into my lungs and got out of the car.

       Too Full of Something   Sometimes I wonder about people.  I wonder why people are often concerned of rating and standardizing things that is in its best when it is pure.  Things like love, passion and all other Moulin Rouge concepts as well as the expression of such seem so commercialized once editors, notable "literary figures" and other so-called experts gets their hands on them.  Vocabluraries are improved, dialogue exchanges are upgraded to its appropriate  wittiness level , and new smart sounding words are used for adjectives.  As if people really converse that way.  As if I love you has become a cliche.  As if mundane words have lost their meaning and power.  There was a time I could almost not remember when people expressed their feelings and wrote them with their heart, guided by their minds, not the other way around.  And in that time, if what you wrote could evoke the same emotions that inspired you, if the reader could see a picture of the soul you imparted on words, and if there was sincerity behind the expression... it was usually enough to be considered great.  Of course, that era is something all childrenn go through and grow out off.  And yet, it seems we have become more critical than before, and simplicity is no longer in fashion.  As such, I really donn't see an Elizabeth Browning or a Lord Alfred Tennyson succeeding in our generation.  Then again, maybe this is just evolution, and simpletons like me just can't keep up.  As such, I'm just blabbering for my own failings and end up being guilty of the very thing I am accusing them.  Such is life.

       Writing Like There’s No Tomorrow   Its been a long time since I have had the luxury to write a blog, so forgive me if my next few entries will be long… tedious… blabbering….and mostly about me.:)   The Day the World Almost Fell Apart   On August 29, 2003, a thank-god-its-payday-Friday, I was going back to the office from a client along Edsa, when the motorcycle gang claimed me as their latest victim.  What I lost was my purse that contained P120 bucks and everything else that seemed to connect me to the rest of the world.  This included my 5 year old cell phone (that had all my phone numbers, including my parents), my PRC card (it’s the only thing that could say without a doubt that yes, I am a CPA!), my first and only credit card (that had my picture), loads of client calling cards, my timezone card and my vanity kit (defined as toothbrush, toothpaste and floss).  The sad part of the story is that except for the bag, which was my most recent purchase, none of the items were worth anything… in fact, my fully depreciated phone even had a security pin which the Thief would have to get unblocked to actually use.  But they were important to me because of what they represent in my life.  Which was the  rest of the world .  I was too shocked to panic for the first few moments.  Only later did I realize how lucky I was that, for the first time in a long time, I was commuting with someone.  With my purse gone, I had no money nor the means to contact anyone.  At all.  Hence, my buddy Matt was one helluva miracle in itself.  However, once shock subsided, I began to feel… alone.  Literally.  After calling my credit card company and ATM and doing all the things a practical accountant would do in this kind of situation, I found myself bursting into tears.  For the simple reason that I could not contact anyone of import…. urlLink Alex  was in UP doing a seminar and would only have his cell phone,  urlLink Jay  was, thank God, at home, but I couldn’t remember his house number after years of not using it,  urlLink Lenard  was also at work, and my mother was at the gym.  It was a terrifying thought that I could not find anyone to talk to.  Of course, my officemates and managers did all that they could to console me.  And since I am from an auditing firm, obviously, the first thing they did was fix my cash flow problem.  I was robbed at 3 pm, which meant withdrawing directly from the bank was out of the question since it was after banking hours.  So my managers gave me P3k in cash while I await my new ATM.  My house keys were in my purse as well, so our head of security immediately contacted a locksmith so that we could change house locks.  And of course, the partners of the firm all reminded me, nicely of course, to block my credit card.  But that wasn’t what I really needed.  In the end, I finally, through desperation, remembered Jay’s home number and for the first time, got to actually talk to his mom (scary, really).  Through him, I was able to get the rest of my friends contact numbers. My mom was already informed as she had contacted the house before leaving the gym.  And so I was more or less, linked up again with the people whom I consider important.  The last nasty thing I had to do was go to the police station in Mandaluyong to file a police report (for my lost driver’s license).  It ended up being the worst part of my day.  I had no cell phone and Alex, whom I had contacted prior to going there, did not exactly sound confident of finding the place.  I had arrived in the police station at 5:00 pm and finished by around 6:30 pm (amazing how long it takes to type one sheet of paper), but it was only P7:30 pm when Alex was able to find me, with my pitiful brown envelope and useless P500 peso bills (I had no barya to use in the payphone), about to have a nervous breakdown. By then, I had the stench only a Filipino police station can render to bare skin, had a million mosquito bites and on the fringe of paranoia at the thought of never being able to get out of that place.  But eventually, all bad days end.  And I was finally picked up.  Brought home where Jay and Lenard were waiting with pizza and drinks.  After my shower, we played Puerto Rico and had lots of fun being Governador of our own lands.  My last thought for that day was, what great friends I had.  After all I’ve been through, the world seemed to right itself after all.  So to all of you buddies, thanks a million for being there for me when I needed the most.

       Kate, you are Left-brained    Most left-brained people like you feel at ease in situations requiring verbal ability, attention to detail, and linear, analytical ability. Whether you know it or not, you are a much stronger written communicator than many, able to get your ideas across better than others.   It's also likely that you are methodical and efficient at many things that you do. You could also be good at math, particularly algebra, which is based on very strict rules that make sense to your logical mind.

       Educated Choice vs. the “Free” One   I always feel guilty for some of the ideas I have to help my struggling country.  However, lately, it seems that guilt is dissolving to disillusionment and idealism is beginning to have less and less appeal.  The result is this:  I have come to the not-so original conclusion that what the country needs is not free choice, but an educated one.  The ramifications of this conclusion are numerous, but perhaps what is the most controversial of all is that in my own envisioned restoration of the country, I believe that  people with no high school degree should not be allowed to vote .  I can pinpoint a thousand reasons how such a regulation could be abused to the detriment of the less fortunate, but I believe, if used wisely, it would be the best and only alternative to reconstruct our broken nation.  And by wisely, I imagine it being done under the premise that:  1)	The majority of the educated would not withhold education from those who weren’t so lucky.   2)	The educated have jobs 3)	The educated would be less likely to be led around the noose by the glitter of stardom and promises of short term gratification 4)	It assumes that in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the educated have at least satisfied the first two levels and would less likely to be ruled by the basic needs  I, of all people, do not want to withhold a right to choose a government simply because they weren’t fortunate enough to finish high school.  But I also believe that when you are near starvation, food and shelter are so scarce, you’d believe the flashiest promises from the people you think you know through their movie/tv personas.  I also believe that long term goals are difficult to determine and assess when you don’t even know when your next meal will be.  While having a high-school diploma does not guarantee all the above (it doesn’t even guarantee having a job), at least it gives me some assurance that these people went through basic economics, basic math, and basic history.  Just like we require voters to be 18 years old, of sound mind and body, I believe that having a diploma assures some level of maturity and knowledge, and not just desperate hopes from a person who don’t and can’t see the bigger picture due to unfortunate limitations.  But then, that’s just me.  Cynical, but still hoping me.  I keep thinking someday, I’ll stop feeling guilty at all and probably loose some of my so-called humanity.  But as one colorful character in Babylon 5 said, these are insane times.  And you must learn to embrace your insanity.   I'm beggining to see the true logic in that.

       Almost Knowing   I cannot speak for the rest of humanity, and possibly not even for a fraction of it, but I have experienced many a time of being in the state of “ almost knowing ” or what other people would prefer to call de ja vu and often wonder if the rest of the world goes through the same.  It’s that split second when you see a person for the first time and a glimmer of recognition hits you.  In that same split second, the other person’s eyes cloud with confusion as both of you begin to scramble for a name, hesitating to make the first hello wave to what maybe a complete stranger.  And then the moment passes.   And the more you see this person (if you do see that person again at all) your belief becomes stronger that whatever recollection you may have thought you had was just a fluke.  A short circuit in the entangled mess of memories.  Sometimes, when romantic whims strike me, I’d like to believe that this phase, the split second of nearly remembering someone relates to our past lives.  The possibility of knowing the soul, if not the mortal shell it is bound to, could be the reason to the state of almost knowing.  And yet, human as we are, dependent on the physical senses as we are, we keep only seeing what our eyes, show us.  And only on moments when we are taken off-guard, like seeing a stranger for the first time, do we remember what our soul remembers.  But then these are whimsical thoughts with no basis whatsoever.  However, for the record, some of these “strangers” with whom I thought I recognized, I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to get to know better.  My best girlfriend Awit was one of them; Sweetie  urlLink Alex  was another; ex-office buddy Jeff as well.

      may282003  To my friend, I don't owe you my friendship but I give it freely anyway.  Not because it is right, not because you deserve it, and certainly not because it is what's required.  I give it for the simple, illogical act of loving.  I can't help though but react instinctively against anyone who obliges me to do something.  Forgive me, my friend, but the more you demand, the more reluctant I am to give.  It doesn't help that whatever it is that you may have felt, or are still feeling, I have been through it, emotion-wise.  I have self-pitied.  I have wailed.  I have attempted suicide.  Several times.  And I grew up.  In all this time, my only companion was the hope that someday, it will be better.  So I picked myself up.  I became stronger.  And I realized, friendships aren't meant to be unconditional.  For if people had accepted me unconditionally the way I was then, I would not have had the motivation to grow out of it.  Forgive me.  I cannot abide seeing you so much like the way I used to be.  Especially when I know you are stronger than that.  Some friends will listen.  Some friends will help.  Others will advise.  I want to be the friend that will never accept you the way your fears make you out to be.  Because you are better than that.  No matter what you say,  this is the faith that I'll keep in you.

       Blog Viewing   A couple of days ago, I was looking for an article regarding Greenbelt and how it won the Urban Land Institute Award (which for some reason, would not load onto my browser with the only on-line paper that had it) when I stumbled into a couple of interesting blogs.  In fact, it got even more interesting to realize that one of them was actually one of sweetie  urlLink Alex's  acquaintances,  urlLink Jobert .  It got even freakier when Alex told me the circumstances of their first (and only?) meeting.  But that story has already been discussed by Alex, and it was amazing that it was really  the   Jobert of the amazing starbucks coffee incident.  What I would like to mention, and as early as now, I ask forgiveness if I have breached the privacy of the person's blog, is one of Jobert's links/friends.  She wrote about her brother, who, despite being in a wheelchair from High school onward, was and is able to live a full, complete life.  With a family and a devotion to something that makes me envious.  Check out the story on this  urlLink site .  This is especially touching and inspiring for me, since one of the little known facts about my life involves having a pretty cousin, born normal, live most of her natural life on a wheelchair.  It was some sort of disease that my clan believes and continues to believe I'm too young to know the nitty-gritty details of.  What is sad was that she had a chance to get an operation, which had a reasonably (you know how doctors are) good chance of being able to walk again.  The clan pooled their money to send her and her family to the states.  Unfortunately, her father couldn't take the chance (the worst case scenario chance) that she dies.  And so, they returned, with no operation, my cousin confined to the wheelchair and my clan divided and angry at the lost opportunity.  Now, sadly, my cousin is 30 something.  I hear from the clan grapevine that she throws tantrums every hour.  She hates her parents and all she can think of is the lost chance at being normal again.  Just thinking of it makes me incredibly sad.  I hope that, if by some weird fate, she is able to read this and the story I featured above, she'll know that life doesn't have to be normal to be happy.  That success is not measured by the completeness of limbs but by the strength of spirit and the love you need to keep on giving despite the circumstances.  And though I cannot say I will every fully understand her, I want her to know that she is family.  I love you ate.

       Believing Anew   Sometimes, especially those raw moments after you've just read the papers, heard the news or watched another of your schedules get mixed in the fruit salad of hell because of another rally, I start wondering about whether God really hates this country... and indirectly hates me and my descendants.  With each passing headline and actor turn presidentiable-wannabe, the world (defined as the country in which I am a citizen of) becomes worse and worse, and heroism lasts only the few seconds its on TV.  I truly wonder what could the nation have done to merit such?  Was it our ancestors? Perhaps it’s our choice of religion (side note:  according to a partner in my firm, no catholic country, save for Italy, ever succeeded), or maybe we're just damn unlucky to have people easily blinded by celebrities.  I even went to the extent of praying that God sends some fiery angel of justice to those who live their lives without ever thinking of such.  And with each day that no fiery angel appears, I lose hope... and sadly, a little faith.    Until now.  Now, as I write down my doubts, I feel ashamed.  For here I am, asking God for His reasons while ignoring all the other things He has given me.  And still, here I am, eating more than I truly need, having money to spend on luxuries, having the opportunity to learn and to be better than I am now, still complaining and hating the uneducated for their uneducated decisions.  It’s almost like hating the sun for rising, or the mountain for not moving.  I'm losing faith in a nation that has given me so much, and hating the people who was given so little.  So now, I will attempt to change all that.  Instead of griping and grimacing over the economic and political uncertainty, instead, I will savor the moments I have with the gifts that was given to me.  I have a boyfriend who loves me and whom I love... friends I care for and who care for me... a family that supports me as I support them... a career that is exhausting and rewarding, despite all my complaints.  And in these gifts, I will bask and allow myself to believe anew.

       It's been a long time since I've written anything akin to poetry, so forgive me.  I'm still a bit rusty.:)   Softly   You whisper softly, like subtle raindrops My heart beat, bravely drowns The forming of meaningful sounds Until inevitably. . . it stops.  For the moment to comprehend The feeling of laughter and tears Of unnamed secret fears And labels, that go beyond a friend  The words spoken, while echoes will persist Clouds drift, suns born and die Hearts proceed to goodbye While intoxicated souls relive the last kiss  You whisper softly, like pouring rain Your meaning becomes clear to me I open my eyes to thunder and see The space you left and the searing pain.

       Monsoon Wedding   I don't usually rate or review movies on my blog, since I personally believe I'm rather shallow and uncultured in terms of liking or disliking a particular film.  Hence, writing a short review on a particular film may reveal to the world just how simple my thought processes can be.  But my most recent movie experience was so... relaxing and nice, and I just   know  that none of my regular GB3 crew would watch it, I just had to dedicate a part of my blog to commemorate the film before it disappears into  Forgetfullness .   So here is my tribute to  Monsoon Wedding .  What I really liked about the film was its straightforwardness.  It was a slice of life in the lives of an Indian (as in Hindu) family and the four days to the wedding of their daughter.  It deals with the many intricacies of family life, relationships, of how they are trying to maintain their identity despite the looming almost suffocating influence of the US.  It was a nice change of pace from big Hollywood films that go for big guns, big bombs and big boobs, to catch the attention of their audience.  It didn't have any special effect, and the most dangerous stunt performed in the entire film was of a guy making a cell phone call from on top of a bamboo tent.  They also had memorable lines, the following of which, I am quoting horribly (I have awful memory, forgive me):   "Only a brave warrior on a horse knows how it is to fall; after all, how could a kneelng coward know anything about  falling?"   and of course, the obligatory father-of-the-bride memorable line:   "If only they (refering to his daughters) would be happy; for that I would take on every trouble... and every sorrow."   This reminds me of another simple film whose title I have long already forgotten.  It was made in some Scandinavian country, and I think it won several awards.  Albeit, this one had a different twist at the end.  The premise and the beginning were deceivingly simple.  It was about a group of couples in a bar.  They were laughing and talking, and pretty much, you get the idea that they're leading perfect lives.  It focuses on one particular couple, whom all though-out the movie, you see are extremely sweet and considerate to each other.  The Guy, however, keeps checking the time.  He calls the waiter, and asks that if he could inform the Guy about the winning lottery numbers.  When he excuses himself to go to the loo, the wife tells the group of friends about the Guy's little vice.  The group decides to play a little trick on the Guy.  They call the waiter and instruct him to tell the Guy that the winning numbers were his favorite numbers to bet on.  In the spirit of fun, the waiter agrees.  The Guy comes back, and sure enough, afer the designated time for the lotto draw, he starts looking for the waiter.  The waiter appears, approaches, and delivers the information, while the rest of the group tried not to snicker.  The waiter leaves, and the Guy seemed stunned.  The group was just waiting to deliver the punchline, when, the Guy stands up, takes out his car keys, his wallet and his watch and puts all of the items on the table.  He turns to his wife and says:  "Here are my belongings.  You can have all of them.  I have been having an affair for the past 6 years, and now, I'm finally rich enough to leave you.  Goodbye."  End of film.  Pretty cynical huh?:) Anyway, my final rating for Monsson Wedding?  9 out of 10.:)

       Excerpts from "The Power of the Human Spirit    Because we all need some optimism in the coming days... here are some excerpts :)   The following is a very inspiring and positive speech of Dr. Josette Biyo, the guest speaker during San Miguel's Best Practices Forum held at the Edsa Shangrila recently.       Dr. Biyo is a public school teacher from Iloilo who won the Intel Excellence in Teaching award in the US, besting 4,000 candidates from all around the world. When asked by the judges why a Phd holder like her opted to teach in a public school in Iloilo, her response was, "And who would teach the kids?"    "The Power of the Human Spirit"   Dr. Josette T. Biyo , 24 October 2003, Edsa Shangrila, Manila   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.    I am here to talk about "The Power of the Human Spirit." Indeed, the human spirit has no limits. If you dream big, and you have the determination and the will to pursue your dream, it will become a reality. I dreamt of making stars; I was given a planet.   A few months ago, I was featured in the local, national and international newspapers. I caused a stir to be the  first Asian teacher to win the "Intel Excellence in Teaching Award" in an international competition held in the U.S. Since its inception in 1997, no Asian teacher has received this award. But I think what created waves was, I am a Filipino, and  I defeated 4,000 other teachers from around the world, including the American finalists in their hometown. Because of this, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory in Boston named a Minor Planet in my honor. There is now a Planet Biyo rotating around the sun which is located between Mars and Jupiter.   In Kentucky, I presented to the panel of judges and to about 150 teachers from all over the world my method of teaching  Science Research to my students in Iloilo. I told them that the Philippines is a third world country blessed with abundant natural resources. However, we face problems such as the rapidly declining environment and the lack of equipment and facilities for scientific endeavors. Faced with this situation, I introduced innovations and strategies for teaching the course. These innovations included: a) building a scientific library, b) conducting field studies, c) establishing linkages with research institutions in the country, d) holding science forums in school, and e) teaching students laboratory and field  techniques which would help them in the conduct of their research work.   I went to Kentucky with three high school students from the Manila Science High School, and one student from the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology. These students competed in the International Science and Engineering Fair which was held back to back with the teaching competition. The students from Manila Science competed for a team project in Physics, while the student from Iligan competed for the individual category in the field of Microbiology. These students were competing with 1,200 other students from around the world.   May 17, 2002 was a glorious moment for the Philippine delegation in the U.S. When it was announced that the student from Iligan won second place grand award for Microbiology, our delegation was ecstatic. When it was announced that the students from Manila Science won first place grand award for Physics, our group was delirious. When the grand award for "Excellence Teaching" was announced, and for the first time in the history of the event an Asian teacher won, and a Filipino, there was a standing ovation from the crowd as the Philippine flag was waved in the air.   Let me show to you the scenario during the first day of the teaching competition.   When I entered the judging area, one table in front was occupied by the board of judges. At the right side of the room, the table was occupied by the finalist from China and her supporters. The table at the left side was occupied by the finalists from U.S. and their supporters. The center table for the Filipino finalist was empty. I sat there alone.   I went to the U.S. bringing a CD for my presentation. I also brought some transparencies and a white board pen in case my CD won't work. Coming from a third world country, I was prepared for the worst. It turned out; I was the only finalist without a notebook computer. Luckily, one American finalist lent me his computer; but before doing so, he gave me a brief lecture on the parts of the computer and its use.   I was the fourth presenter. When it was my turn to present, a panel member asked if I needed an interpreter. I said, "No  thanks." Personnel from Intel volunteered to run my presentation. I said, "I can do it." After my presentation, they said, "Wow, you're so cool. You know more than us!"   What am I telling you? That despite our country's limited resources, Filipinos can compete globally given the proper training, support and exposure. Our winning at the international scene may not reflect the general condition of science education in the country. But with our concerted efforts, my dear fellowmen, we can move this country forward  and show the world that we are a globally competitive race.   Last May, I was in Cleveland, Ohio to present my methods of teaching to 150 teachers from 17 countries. I also served as the team facilitator for the Spanish-speaking teachers from Brazil, Costa Rica and Argentina. Last August, I gave a demonstration lesson to educators from the third world countries of Laos and Cambodia.    In winning this international award, I do not claim to be the best teacher of the land. There are thousands of best teachers out there, working silently, giving their hearts to teaching, without thinking of benefits or rewards. I salute these teachers. In winning this award, I believe I was just commissioned by somebody up there to deliver the message that indeed, Filipino teachers can be world-class teachers.   During the panel interview in the U.S., one judge asked me, "You have a Ph.D. in Biology, why do you teach in high school?" I answered, "And who will teach these kids?" Another judge asked how much am I paid for all my pains. They were shocked when I told them that I am getting a net pay of not more than $300 a month.   Believe in what you are doing. Believe that you can make a difference. Believing however doesn't mean you have to stop from where you are now. Believing is improving your skills and maximizing your potential. With determination and the will to win, your company can conquer the world.   Be proud!

       Career Choices   There.  I did it.  I sent my resume to a headhunter.    With almost-comedic finality, I pressed the “Send” button on my outlook and watched my message get whisked away, along with my aspirations, regrets and doubts.  Almost immediately, I felt regret.  And then, freedom.  And then… fear.    Why must life be filled with such difficult choices?  A year and a half ago, while defying my parents' wish of having me safely tucked away in a stable multinational company with an 8-5 job, I took on the work of being an auditor as soon as I got my CPA license. This caused my parents distress at the thought of their only daughter toiling away in an industry known for its high-powered spinsters while being plagued by their diseases of choice, such as hyperacidity, heartburn, high-blood and other hellish ailments.   But I knew better.  At least, I thought I did back then.  And in some ways, I was right.  And in others, I was wrong.  Now, a year and a half later, I’m writing this blog after sending my resume to a headhunter.  The original plan was to stay in audit for at least, 2 years.  Now, I don’t even know if I can finish the “busy season”.  And my wonderful, predictably unpredictable parents have decided that audit isn’t so bad after all.    What happened you may ask?  I’m not sure myself.  It’s not that I’m not doing well, or that I don’t get along with the people I work with.  Sure, there is the occasional hysterical client, and the occasional clashes with superiors and subordinates, as well as the a-bit-more-occasional temper tantrums after 36 hours of no sleep.  But all in all… it wasn’t unpleasant.  Add to that, I’m actually doing well, getting the highly coveted “ exceeds expectations ” accolade for almost every engagement  (I know, I know, humility seems to be my strong suit:P ).  And, there are after all, perks to being in audit.  Since we are in a project-based industry, when there is no project, you are more or less free to do what you want.  Like taking 2 to 3 hour lunches, or writing long blogs like this one. Of course, if there is a project… like my nightmarish encounter with  the Bank , then, eating becomes a luxury and sleep, even more so, but that’s for another post.  Now, the appeal of being in this industry is slowly eroding.  In a melodramatic sense, I feel like a rock by the shore, and with every wave that clashes into me, I am diminished:  reasonably, substantially intact, but never again to be completely and totally whole.  And beyond these melodramatics, I’m just… tired.  Not physically so, since, I must admit, sleep and food is sufficient.  But tired in a way that I can barely describe but only know to be real.    A couple of weeks back, I was told that I would be sent to France as a “reward” for my exceptional work ( kuno ) for the past year.  While I actually got thrilled of going to Europe (one of my life-long dreams), I also started feeling confined.  First they’ll send me to France (for work by the way) and then what?  A couple of more years of doing backbreaking work for money that do not really commensurate what you lose (like time) and gain (like wrinkles) with every engagement.  But the fear settles in.  What if this is the best a person can hope for?  What if audit is really my calling, and what I really need is a vacation not a new job?  What if I switch occupations and end up in the fire from the frying pan?  What if everything is worse there, and I don’t do so well, and I’ll end up being bored to tears, or working even more than I already am… What if, what if.  I guess all I can really do is pray.  If the headhunter is as good as he says he is, I’ll have some choices before the year-end.  Hopefully the Guy upstairs will show me some sign (hopefully, not through a black-out in the city) and by then I’ll know what I have to do.  Until then…I’ll just blog my fears out and brace myself for the coming busy season.

       Stupiditus Repeatism   Stupiditus Repeatism.  That is my personal term for the effect of doing something, and changing it, editing it, revising it and metamorphing it to an extent only to realize that the “finalized” product was the first thing you did.  It’s all about making that wonderful 360-degrees turn and end up bighting your own tail.  It’s a frustrating event that makes you wonder what else you couol have done about the lost time (in my case specifically, weeks) re-doing and correcting what was already correct.  In audit, this has more ramifications than merely wasted time and aging another 20 years in the span of a month (as if that in itself, to an auditor is not a crime).  I have found that I have reported 5 different sets of figures, the first and 5th being exactly the same.  Sigh.  You’d think the 2nd to 4th were improvements.  That they were actually progress…  Oh well.  Anyway, back to work.  I can only gnaw on my frustrations for so long.

       Holiday Reflection   Quite recently, I had received what I had thought was the answer to all my prayers to get out of my not-so-enjoyable work place.  It came with almost wondrous timing -- I was tired with the amount of work, I was pissed with my so-called peers and most of all, I was frustrated with the resource management policies my Firm adhered to.  And so I sent my resume to a Headhunter.  Lo and behold, an offer before the year ended.  It was an offer that was both more and less than what I wanted.  In true accountant-I-shall-bullet my thoughts as I write style, the offer consisted of the following:  1)  Compensation -- not bad... not what I truly wanted either.  I had toiled in the audit industry not because I loved the work (although I do admit to liking it... somewhat) but because I felt this was an investment in my "market value" when I go into the private sector.  The compensation however, though did not meet my expected salary, had a couple of bonuses of which I did not think I would get, like guaranteed 15 months and a 20% tax shield.  Downside is that salary increases are not guaranteed.  In fact, if I understood them correctly, even if I perform above average, I still won't get a guranteed increase unless my superior recommended it.  As I said, not bad... not what I expected.  2)  Work hours -- very good.  I have been assured, not only by the HR but also by people I know who work there, that the Company did not require overtime on weekends, and weekday extensions are few and tolerable.  Wonderful really, especially since I plan to take post graduate studies in the coming year.  3)  Career development -- well, I start out as an assistant manager -- quite good considering I'm only 23 and have only been in the work force for about a year and a half.  Its also a lovely thing to put in your resume, to have already been an assistant manager at a respectable universal bank at that.  After considering all these, I have decided to say no.  Weird huh?  Some might guess that deep down inside, I really do love the work I have and can't really leave, even if there was a better offer.  Others might think that I'm just being too picky.  While these 2 reasons are not entirely wrong, the real reason I had opted to turn it down, much to the dismay of my mother, is that I feel like I'm compromising.  Currently, I'm handling major projects for the Firm.  And as I have mentioned before, it is quite possible that I will be sent to France as a reward of sorts for the good work.  To leave this Firm in the middle of the audit season (for the uninniated:  its the period from November to April) would mean burning a whole lot of bridges.  And to burn them for a compensation that did not really meet my expectations and a salary increase that was not guaranteed?  I can only hope that a better offer would come at a better time... hopefully around March or April that will allow me to leave gracefully and get into the workforce of a wonderful company who knows how to treat their people right.  But I guess everybody hopes for this and I can only wish we all get what we want... in some form or the other.

       Hectic Christmas Weekend   As the title suggests, its been one helluva hectic weekend.  As I type, I'm currently nodding off due to exhaustion.  It doesn't help that the next couple of days would be even more hectic as Alex and I will be navigating and balancing family obligations during the so-called holidays.  But, as always, the thought that it is Christmas, whether or not I'll get any rest during this celebratory respite, still makes the exhaustion worth it.  And the rare kind of satisfaction that I surprisingly got from the events the past weekend makes it even more so.  Take for example the Aegis Christmas party last Saturday.  Alex and I arrived at aroun 5-ish and were soon tasked to help with the "little-but-when-added-up-are-major" things to accomplish.  I had to "womangle" a chicken (as oppossed to mangling it), chop up the pork, assist the wonderful but unconventional cook Seth (I want the chicken and the liempo Seth, cook some more!), get the guests, finish/fine-tune the games, assist Alex in finalizing trivia questions and arrange whatever items I can see.  It doesn't sound much right now, but God, that was tiring.  When the party began, I had to guard the liempo and dimsum from disappearing before the go signal to eat was given (I also found out that I can be pretty proficient with scissors and tongs, so beware!).  And then, after dinner, Alex and I hosted the boistrous and rather opinionated group of Aegis people for the games (I thought we did quite well, all things considered).  But after everything was over, it felt... great.  Not I've-won-the-lotto great.  But great.  And of course, I will have phrases to remember it by such as "Repair of the King".  I guess the true Christmas is not merely enjoying the celebration, but also getting tired and seeing other people enjoy what you have done.  Now if only I can get a bit more sleep, maybe I can compose a better blog....:(

       Encounters With Magic   I never really consciously knew when I started wondering if I had encountered or have unwittingly used magic.  Its like a slow awakening -- you don't know when you dreaming stopped and reality began.  In my case, I can only remember knowing that there must be magic.  Most probably a magic deeply rooted in our very creation -- after all, we were made in the image of God.  We might be closer to him than we have allowed ourselves to be.    But while that may be heresy, I cannot deny that there have been instances in my life where either I was pretty damn lucky or my Guardian Angel and loving ancestors pulled off pretty big favors from God to get me off the hook.  Either way I'm thankful.  After all, I wouldn't be alive today had it not been for the greater powers that be.  Take for example, one of the bigger mysteries in my life.  I was in college back then, and learning, for the first time, how to drive.  Of course, my best bud Al thought, mistakenly, that the best place to learn to drive would be in the narrow roads of Greenhills using his then brand new Honda City.  Of course, the wisdom of his choice would be questioned later, but hey, we were in college, what did you expect.  Anyway, back to the story.  Here I was, doing my first "run".  All I had to do was drive a straight line and stop befoe hitting a wall.  Easy right?  Wrong!  I panicked while nearing the wall and my best bud never-have-taught-anyone-driving pal Al, panicked as well.  All I could remember him saying is "Step on the breaks!  The breaks!".  And then I did the most unforgiveable thing... I closed my eyes and turned -- safely into another person's driveway.  In fact, the driveway, which i had no idea existed, was suddenly there, conveniently at the spot where I had chosen to turn.  The placement was so perfect that Al thought (and still continues to think to this day -- I don't want to give him nightmares) that the act of turning was really my plan after all.  He even congratulated me afterwards, while failing to notice that my knuckles where white and how badly I was hyperventilating.  There are other such instances in my life, although a bit less obvious.  Like my college entrance exam.  My priority colleges were -- Ateneo, UP and DLSU, in that order.  Ateneo had the most difficult exam -- asking questions that dealt with subjects I did not do well in, like Biology, Chemistry and Trig.  UP on the other hand, was also difficult due to the Filipino and Science parts of the test.  And DLSU had the easiest one, reminding me more of an IQ test more than anything else.  I passed Ateneo and into my favored quota course and even (God knows how) got myself a partial scholarship.  For UP, I was given the go signal to skip the first 2 courses of English and Math.  And DLSU, well, I just passed.  It was as if I had magically obtained the answers to the exam of my favored colleges from thin air, for, I sincerely have no idea how I got in.  As I have mentioned, I have many more similar experiences.  No, I have not won anything expensive.  Nor have I suddenly learned the ability to fly through sheer will.  But I believe that instances like these indicate greater powers that we can actually comprehend.  And, untrained and unprepared as I am, can only claim to be lucky enough to see it every once in a while.

       Friday's Vignette:  How the Wolfgirl lost her eye   Wolfgirl was confused.  The Big People were asking so many questions and she can't honestly tell if she's telling them what they wanted to hear.  Their first question had been to ask what was her name.  She had answered the name her Papa had called her ever since she became a bad girl.  "My name is Bitch."  The Big People looked upset with what she said, however.  Almost by instinct, she cringed when a Big Man raised his hand threateningly at her.  She was surprised that it landed gently on her head, combing it almost like the way she had remembered it a long time ago.  She moved away from the caress.  Big People were never to be trusted.  Never.  The Big Man took his hand away and smiled.  Distractedly, she remembered her Papa, smiling like that once a long time ago, maybe when she was still a good girl.  Her one good eye drifted to the window behind the Big People and wondered what time Papa will pick her up.  "Do you have another name?"  One of them asked.  Another name?  She wrinkled her nose and tried to remember.  Yes, there was a time when she was called differently.  Mama was still with her then, and she was reading a story of a good girl in a red riding hood and the big bad wolf.  Mama said that bad girls turn into wolves, and then she pointed at the ugly picture of a half-dog, half person on the book.  But then Mama kissed her and hugged her when she became afraid.  Mama had a different name for her back then, but she can no longer remember.  It doesn't matter anyway.  Can't they see what a bad girl she was?  "I call myself Wolfgirl."  She admitted, reluctantly.  It is better to have said it now, before they start punishing her for hiding things, just like Papa. The Big People still looked a bit upset, but they didn't try to touch her again.  She thought that was a good sign.  The Big People continued to ask her questions after that.  She tried to answer as respectfully and as accurately as possible, without any feeling.  She only felt the great sadness when she was asked about how she had lost her eye.  She remembered it clearly.  It was the day that Papa came home to work only to find out that Mama was gone.  Wolfgirl was playing in her room when Papa came and screamed at her.  It was the day she realized that Mama left them forever all because she was such a bad girl.  Papa started punishing her that day.  He took a bottle of beer and aimed for her head.  He hit her right eye instead.  Wolfgirl could remember the pain.  So much pain.  As well as the tears of blood that fell to stain her pretty Sunday dress.   It was then she knew that things would never be the same.  Now, a dirty patch covers her right eye.  Her Mama had never returned and Papa had never stopped blaming her for it.  She explained that Papa was only doing the right thing, seeing that she had turned into a bad, bad wolf.  She felt the urge to cry, but knew she couldn't.  Crying only invited more punishment.  Only Big People had the right to cry.  Only Big People like Papa cry without blood.  The Big People are standing slightly away from her now and talking in hushed tones.  Wolfgirl knew it was only a matter of time before the hurting started again.  She held her dirty rag doll close to her lips.  "Don't worry Princess." She whispered.  "I'll be here if you cry.  You can cry for the both of us."

       Here's a story I'm thinking of finishing before the end of the year.  Not because its beautiful, but simply because I have to finish it, if only as an excercise of discipline.  Again, feel free to comment.:)    Fire Sticks (Chapter 1: Rebirth)     I never was a spectacular child. I had modest grades, modest looks and modest accomplishments that made my modest parentsâ€¦ happy. I grew up and did well enough to be considered above average â€“ but just barely. I was just Maria Dela Cruz (or Mary for the conyo version), champion of mediocrity and defender of â€œjust-being-good-enoughâ€�. No frills, no extras. But Life often throw curve balls when you least expect it and its either you hit back, with all your might to take a shot for that one moment of purposeful glory, or take the walk of shame back to anonymity.   And this is what my story is about: me hitting back.   It all began when I just turned eighteen. To celebrate my entry into the world of R-18 movies and finally being legally allowed to drive, I took up a contact sport my parents would never have allowed me to do had I been younger: arnis. I had been persuaded that this was a good idea by my other friends, who, after coming back from practice with â€œbattle scars", claimed that they had the time of their life. And it was also an excellent way to lose weight, an important deciding factor for one who, upon stepping on that magical age, has finally been allowed to date.   I, of course, had my doubts, but at 18, you think youâ€™re invincible. And so I joined.   My first practice was everything, pessimist that I am, had expected: bad ranging to extremely bad. My first dozen injuries, Iâ€™m ashamed to admit, came not from my sparring partner or from my teacher, but from my own clumsiness. The day after my first practice, I was black and blue and red (from humiliation) with aching muscles in body parts I never knew existed. At that time, there was nothing I wanted more than to lick my wounds, quit arnis and forget words such as â€œabanikoâ€� and â€œsinawaliâ€� had ever existed. But come next practice, I was there, trudging my bag and grimacing in advance for the inevitable pain. Foolishly, I thought I was just being a crazy masochistic teenager for not giving up. But when I came to the third and the succeeding practices after that, I should have known something was different. I should have known something was brewing in Fateâ€™s sordid mind. I just simply should have known better. But I didnâ€™t.   To the surprise of my teacher and my fellow arnis-mates, I began to catch up with the lessons with slightly less than break-neck speed. I began to hit myself less, my reaction time improved and for once, after several months of training, I was a little bit more than just modest. I was still far from the star pupil, Eric, who seems to live and breathe the art, but I became competent enough that my teacher actually recommended that I join the annual tournament. Of course, he bluntly added he didnâ€™t expect me to win (I honestly think that he was just trying to ease the pressure off me, in an odd barbaric sort of way) but it would be nice for me to get the â€œfeelâ€� of an actual competition so that next time, I can actually be a contender.   Being 18 and 7 months, I was ecstatic and flattered. And against the better judgment of my parents and the guy I was currently seeing, I accepted.   Little did I know that the moment of acceptance would seal my fate. The curve ball was coming and I had no freaking idea.   _____________________________________________________________________________________________  â€œSo, are you ready for this?â€� Keith asked with his trademark â€œI-donâ€™t-think-youâ€™re-ready-for-this" charm as he watched the other gladiator wannabes get whacked and whipped all over the gym.   â€œNo, but Iâ€™m as ready as Iâ€™ll ever be.â€� I shrug off my sweater carelessly flinging it over a chair. I missed.   This does not bode well.   â€œMaria Loretta Dela Cruz and Michelle Lyn Santos, please go to ring 2.â€� The speaker blared for the second time. I grimaced as I heard my second name, which I had shrugged off as being non-existent when I could, being said in a gym of close to 200 people, not counting the participants. This does not bode well in deed.   I give Keith a small kiss on the cheek, put on a bright smile and waved at my parents seated in the bleachers at the back. I drop the smile as soon as I turn to head for ring 2. My mother is holding a rosary.   Great.   It seems no one thinks I could actually live through the first round. â€œWish me luck but donâ€™t wish me to break a leg, ok?â€� I shout out, not bothering to turn. I knew Keith was worried. And I knew what I said would calm him somewhat. Now, I can only hope it would calm me.   I arrive at ring 2 and came face to face with my first opponent, Michelle Lyn Santos. She was around 5â€™3, around my height, with about twice my muscle. She had the I-know-what-Iâ€™m-doing air as she efficiently strapped her armor and helmet in place. I look blankly at the armor and helmet the officials were handing me. I suddenly feel stupid. Before this moment, I realize that I have never strapped my own armor or placed my own helmet before. I turn to look for my instructor and found him cheering Eric at ring 8, 5 rings away from mine. I look back nervously at my armor and helmet.   I bit my lower lip. Well, this couldnâ€™t be that daunting. At least I knew which way was up, but what do you do with the straps at the side? Somehow, ribbons don't seem to fit in the picture when it comes to armor.   Michelle Lyn Santos was already stepping into the ring. With relief, I saw the sides of her armor strapped in small ribbons. I quickly finish putting the suit. I take a deep breath and one last look at the gym before the match begins.   The gymnasium was moderately brimming with people. However, spectators are kept at bay in the seats surrounding the gym, to keep them from distracting the participants while only teachers and officials are allowed to step near the rings. I begin to feel my insignificance as the whacks and various evilly painful sounds continue even as I am on the brink of going to my first match.   I finally step into the ring with my armor and helmet in place. I feel weird. The helmet nullifies some of the sound while seeming to amplify my breathing as well as my heartbeat. I suddenly, for the first time in my life, feel claustrophobic, Even the light red cotton pants I was wearing, that seemed so easy to wear have become constraining. I gulp down the urge to suddenly vomit and instead tried to focus on my opponent.   She was standing calmly about 2 meters away from me. On the good side, she didnâ€™t seem to notice that I was on the brink of having a heart attack. On the bad side, she didnâ€™t seem like the type to care, either way.   I find myself praying a fast Our Father and Hail Mary. I donâ€™t even bother to look for my â€œsupportersâ€�. I donâ€™t think I had the strength to carry on a confident smile at my current condition.   I hear the official saying something in Filipino, which I didnâ€™t understand, partly due to the helmet and partly due to my seemingly loud pulse rate. But I did hear and understand one word.   â€œSimula!â€�   She drew first blood, literally, as she made a quick hit to my head with enough force that the helmet hit my lower lip. I tasted blood, but despite my aversion to it, I had enough common sense to back out before she makes her second attack. The official quickly stepped in, to give the judges time to give her a point for a connected hit. After the momentary pause, she took another chance at a headshot, but this time I was a bit more prepared. Fortunately, I blocked it easily. Unfortunately, I forgot that my left arm-wielding stick could actually be used. That moment of forgetfulness was enough for her to move out before I could do any damage. Her next attack was not as brash. At least now she knew I had some skill. Just some.   We circled each other for a few moments before she took on the offensive again. Apparently, those few moments of appraising each other had a more beneficial effect on her since she was able to connect, for the second time, this time on the leg.   I made a very lady-like (and therefore embarrassing) yelp. And Michelle Lyn Santos found her first smug smile.   And thatâ€™s when I became angry.   The sparring that ensued was the best one I have ever had. If my teacher had been watching, I knew he would have been proud. But my opponent just had more skill, talent and most importantly, endurance than I did. After 6 minutes of intense blocking and attacking, I was panting for breath. And although I was able to make some clean shots, I knew that she had more connected hits, mostly in the last 5 minutes. And in this tournament, where hits translate to points, I knew that winning was out of the question.   At that moment, I knew that I had nothing left to prove (and most importantly, no one to prove it to anyway). I was actually about ready to tell the official to stop it, before any real harm was done. I already had proven my point but I was also logical enough to know that I just wasnâ€™t in her level. I let my arms drop, and consequently, my guard.   And then suddenly, I was facing the stadium ceiling.   It took me 5 whole seconds (I know this to be accurate since the refereeâ€™s words only began to register when he reached number 5) to realize that I was on my back. My rival had dared to attack me with my guard down. I remember shaking my head once. Twice. And before the referee could get to ten, I stood up.   And then I realized something weird and freaky. I didnâ€™t hurt. Anywhere. I took a look at my hands and I saw blood. They were practically dripping with it. My eyes drifted to my sticks and they too were covered in blood. Then I realized that the whole world seemed to be throbbing in tandem with my heart. And, almost on cue, Michelle Lyn Santos took that moment of confusion to attack me.   She didnâ€™t succeed. She never was able to hit me again.   In a blur I began to block and attack with more than just break-neck speed. I couldnâ€™t count the number of times I hit her, all I knew was that there was an urgent need to attack. Anything. And she was the most convenient target.  At the back of my head, a part of me wondered why the official wasn't stopping the match now that there was bloodshed. But the thought was brushed aside as my body continued to use the skill of a memory I never knew I had. I remember stopping only when the official would pull us apart, but even then, I knew I didn't want to.   In truth, I could barely see anyone. For some reason someone from another placeâ€¦ another time seem to be overlapping with Michelle Lyn Santosâ€™ image. And then suddenly, I couldnâ€™t see her anymore. For a moment I was confused, until my eyes drifted to the floor.  And there I found her -- her eyes terrorized, her hands free of the padded arnis sticks and covering her face.   I had won.   The official announced me as a winner. Through the haze, I saw my opponent limping out of the ring. I felt a twinge of regret. I look down at my hands, still holding on the sticks, and noted that the blood I was sure I had seen there, was gone. That's when I realized something with alarming certainty.   That wasn't me fighting her.   And Whoever it was that had taken over me in the middle of the fight, she wanted to fight some more.

       Binary Tree Poetry -- Somewhat:  Betrayed   Here is my take on  urlLink JB's  revised binary poetry form... as the name suggests, this is patterned after, well, the binary tree (which I vaguely remembered being explained in a Sweet Valley High novel, but that was decades ago).  Anyway, I wanted to try my hand at it, but be forewarned, this is still more of a practice poem than anything else.  Feel free to comment on what you think.    Another disclaimer:  this is also not exactly the same formula that JB and  urlLink Dean  used because... well, I just can't write that long...:P  I'd like to think this is an, er, shortened version of the system...So here it goes....   Betrayed   Shards of memories frozen in moments, while dying stars die falling Shards of memories frozen in moments, No Respite comes from Disillusionment While dying stars die falling, and silence engulfs the unworthy  Ashen promises get blown away, into Corrupted Innocence's embrace Ashen promises get blown away, while In Pain attempts to pray Into Corrupted Innocence's embrace, Betrayal comes too easily  No Respite comes from disillusionment, while In Pain attempts to pray And silence engulfs the unworthy, Betrayal comes too easily Shards of memories frozen in moments, and still dying stars die falling...

       Annoying Tuesday Morning   Times like these, I feel even more motivated to resign from this hellish job.     Annoyance # 1)  Work Area   I arrive, as per usual, around 9 am this morning at work.  Last week, in anticipation of the 50 new associates arriving, I had already carved out my own table in the "in-charge's area".  This meant cleaning and clearing out files that have been there since the beginning of time...At least in the beginning of my Firm's stint in this building.  I also took the liberty of placing my stuff, to mark my territory so to speak, since I was one of the first to actually realize that tables will be rare for the coming months.  The other people who have done so before me, have also marked their territory.  I had half expected, that they would extend the same courtesy to me, as they have to their "friendly friends" with whom they say defensively to anyone who approaches their "friendly friends" area, that it has already been taken.  I was wrong.  But that didn't make me lose my temper.  Instead, I decided to make my territory even more clear.  I put my name on the table. In BIG BOLD LETTERS.  And guess what?  This morning, I find another in-charge working in my area, without even offering to apologize for the fact that, well, that is my area.  She didn't even give me a second look.  And the space beside me, which was empty, was "saved" for one of the friendly friends. And the other table which could have been another area, somebody placed files on the chair, on the table and on the floor... so obviously, I cannot work there.  F***.  So instead, I had to find a new place to work.  Only to find out later that another girl was able to clear the table with files and work there.... Double F***.   Annoyance # 2)  Professional Peers   Same girl who claimed my work space, comes up to me, and says, quite casually that she wants to get my staff to continue working for her account.  I ask, through clenched teeth, until when.  And guess what again.  She wants to use my staff until the end of my own forecast (estimated completion date of my account).  She wasn't even going to offer me alternatives... until I told her, quite simply, No.  And then, since I empathized with her, I suggested extending my staff's forecast next week to be able to accommodate both our clients.  And she acted as if she expected me to fix that!!!  As if she had any right... any f***ing right.   Annoyance # 3)  Resource Management   Currently, our audit group has 61 associates, 20 senior associates and 2 supervising seniors plus an array of managers, directors and partners.  The other group has around 80++ associates and god knows how many other superiors.  We share one area.  This area has 17 desktop computers.  Of the associates, I'm estimating optimistically, that around 40 for both groups have laptops, of which, possibly 20 belongs to our group.  That means that in our group alone, there are 41 staff level auditors who have no consistent access to computers.  These people are the ones that do the grunt work of investigating and examining and most importantly documenting audit issues.  And all the partners and the IT can say, is that the associates DON'T NEED IT.  It's not even industry average.  In the 3 other big auditing firms, 2 being bigger than us, and the other one being smaller than us, laptops are provided to EACH ASSOCIATE on your SECOND DAY OF WORK.  Did I also mention that there are only 3 printers servicing the audit area?  2 of which are notorious to jam.  WHAT THE F*** WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I ENTERED THIS PLACE?  And the many other small things that I'm just too frustrated to write about right now.  What was I thinking?  God, please help me find a better job... I don't think I'll remain sane in this current one.

       GARY V -- XX   Last friday, I watched the Gary V. concert in Araneta Colleseum with sweetie  urlLink Alex  and his sister Corrin.  To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to this one certain reasons.  One, I have already watched Gary V. perform several times, and most of his performances seem to have similar scripts.  Good as they were, they were not exactly the type of material you watch again.  Second, I have very bad memories of Araneta... from what I recall from my last visit (which was during the Alanis days), it was dark, extremely crowded, traffic-surrounded collesuem in the unexplored North.  I'm glad to say that I was wrong on both accounts.  First, the Araneta.  It was brighter (newly painted I presume) and more convenient to get to then last I remembered.  An added plus was the presence of several well-known restaurants and dessert places within the concert venue itself.  The seats were also comfortable and though there was a significant amount of people, it didn't seem that crowded.    As for Gary V., it was intresting to see him perform several numbers that wasn't in his usual script.  The song I liked best was a duet with his daughter (around 10 or 11 I assume) where they say Where is the Love by Black Eyed Peas.  I guess talent is in the genes, since his daughter was pretty good.  Another thing I liked was the beginning act.  At first, when the man in white came out with the white fog and all, dancing like Gary V, I thought it  was  Gary.  I was surprised to find out later, when Gary V finally came out, that it was actually his son, Gabriel, age 15.  As I said, in the genes.:)  Other highlights included Alex's cousin performing in a special percussion only song, an extemely exciting duet with Jaya, wonderful blending with Luke and JR.  Sigh... I wouldn't mind repeating this experience again....:)

       Surreal   If someone can actually explain the logic of the following inter-office memo, I'm all ears...:   The success of  the Firm largely depends on the trust and confidence that our partners and staff will gain from our existing and potential clients. While technical competence is required from each member of the Firm, professional behavior and office decorum is expected from all of us at all times.   It has been observed that some employees listen to music with the use of headphones or earphones at their workstations. This does not exhibit proper office decorum.   Furthermore, it was brought to our attention by several of our clients that our staff wear headphones or plug in earphones while at the client’s offices, with the volume of music turned up loud enough for other people to hear.  Please be reminded that the use of headphones or earphones in the office and at the client’s office is considered improper office behavior.  Our Code of Conduct states that “we act with…professional maturity, performing our work with diligence…we perform our work in a manner that engenders pride in ourselves, our Firm and the name of _____.”  Wearing headphones, earphones or other similar accessory is considered a violation of our Code of Conduct, and the applicable disciplinary action shall be administered accordingly.  We should all bear in mind that we are expected to project and maintain an image of responsibility and proper decorum at our workplace and the client’s office.  As members of a professional Firm, we should exercise good judgment in displaying a professional appearance and keeping the professional environment up to our standards.   Honestly, I don't know how wearing headphones affected professionalism...damn, gotta find myself a new place to work...

       First Impressions and everything afterwards   Perhaps now more than ever, since I took that Enneagram test, I wonder how people perceive me.  For almost all my life, I have always thought and known that I was emotional and assertive, which, I believe, are the 2 most important ingredients of passion.  That was why it took me a long time to come to terms with taking a course which was everything I thought I wasn't and a bit more.  But eventually, I've come to terms with accounting, and truth be told, I'm actually quite happy... somewhat.  But maybe a part of me, or even the entire me, changed to cope with circumstances (some inevitable, some I encountered by choice) I was faced with.  Not only the choice of college course, but also other things, like broken relationships, renewed and new friendships, graduating etc.  The Ennegram test somewhat proved my hypothesis.  My sensitivity rating was my lowest characteristic.  My highest being Aggressiveness and Image Awareness (ironically true).  I sort of feel sad at these changes... although I know the exam is not accurate, a part of me says that the test whispers some truth.  The conclusion I have is that I really don't like the person I've become... especially since I was quite comfortable with the person I was.  But whether I like or dislike myself I guess, is an academic question.  After all, human nature dictates that we change to survive.  And granting all I've been through, I guess survive I did.  I'm also glad that I have friends who, I know, I annoy every now and then, but who I feel still love me in their own quirky ways anyway.  And of course I have a sweetie, in whose arms I feel that I am the most beautiful and cherished woman in the world.  To paraphrase Julie Andrews, in all my wicked childhood, I must have done something good.   "And if I shake a little almost everyday  Because I'm more frightened than strangers ever know  And if I show you my trembling side...  The trembling fearful part I hide,  I wonder...  Will you be my friend?"

       Defeated Again   Today is qualifying as a Bad Day.  I wouldn't say its on my top ten Bad Days, but due to the fact that today symbolizes a new year in almost a third of the world's culture, I can't help but feel a bit put out.  It started with my shining accomplishment yesterday:  the tax computation.  And yes, as my paranoid fears have warned me, there were several glaring mistakes I saw in harsh morning-after-I've-drunk-coffee light.  I spent the entire morning crunching numbers beside my manager, who, after 4 hours, gave up on it as well.  He just told me we'll let the client do the explaining.  I can't help but feel... frustrated.  On the good side, I wasn't exactly alone and stupid for not figuring stuff out.  On the bad side, I feel strangely unaccomplished.  Then, its my shoes.  MY 2 week old shoes gave up on me shortly after lunch.  The heel won't hold and now I feel like I'm walking on a tight rope.  I'm seriously tempted to buy a new pair, if it weren't for a shortage of cash.  Actually, to be honest, I'm not really short in cash as much as I hate buying something that I hadn't budgeted for, but that's for another blog.  Managers following up deadlines would be the next near disaster.  I hate it when managers follow up stuff I know they won't review ANYWAY.  Its as if they just want to annoy you and deprive you of time.  I hate it more when the same manager would go straight to the staff and declare to the said staff that they don't have to finish certain things -- kung ano lang kaya.  And then go back to the in-charge asking the said items to be accomplished.  While I don't consider myself a slave driver, I have fairly high expectations of staff competencies and the act of the manager going straight to the staff undermines my authority as well as makes me look like a slave driver.  When I'm not.  And now, he wants me to finish the things the staff wasn't able to finish. Damn him.  Before I explode into a million irritated pieces I'll shut up and go to work.  After all, every freakin journey begins with a single step...in my current state of mind, it would most likely be a stomp.

       In the Light of Day   I hate to admit it, but I take a lot of pride, sometimes warranted, other times unwarranted, in my work.  This includes, among many things, my ability to understand, compute and ultimately correct income tax computations of my numerous clients.  Its one of the more technical sides of auditing (ironically, is not really part of the strict definition of audit) and requires one to be abreast with various Revenue Regulations as well as being able to place one's self in the client shoes. And until yesterday, I thought I was doing a pretty good job.  But, as with all hubris, it is deemed to meet opposition with something bigger, more complex and inexplicably wrong than you can ever correct -- at least, not in one day.  As such, yesterday I spent the day with dogged determination to understand the tax computation prior auditors (now resigned) have given up on.  I felt stupid and tired when, at around 9 pm, I still didn't get it.  No matter how I try, I can't seem to make any headway, and it seems that I just made things worse.  And so defeated, I went home.  Today however, with new resolve (I'm stubborn that way), I attempted to understand it again.  Lo and behold, I was able to get several major chunks of mess and somehow was able to "right" it.  Of course, there is the probability that I'm just deluding myself and I just haven't figured out something that would make all my morning for naught, but I still feel hopeful.  Maybe it isn't so difficult after all.  Maybe I can still keep my pride and hubris.  Sigh, only time can tell.

       Best Moments -- 2nd Philippines Sci-Fi Convention   Here are snippets of the best moments for me:   Knight Jinx to 6 year old boy (points to a picture of Superman et al book):  Look!  Superman! 6 year old boy looking at book:  You mean the Justice League?   and then there's this:   Elvin, while ordering in jollibee, turns to us:  Jollibee has no breasts! Female behind the counter, with a straight face:  Thigh lang po talaga sir... The rest of us look at the...uh...rather less endowed female waiter and wonder what alternate universe we got ourselves into    and of course this:   Kylie, waving a wand, wearing a multicolored porcupine clown hat to new recruit:  You must join us!  You must! Pointyman:  He's not one of us believe me... (shakes his head vigarously) Kylie, still waving wand:  Yes, I'm part of the Pinoy Harry Potter Group! Join us!   So many moments... so many moments... I'm glad I joined this con...:)

       2nd Philippines Sci-Fi Fantasy Convention   Phew... the title alone is indicative of just how long the weekend was due to the Con.  I'm writing this a bit late and probably, most of my readers would have already read about it in other blogs, since, well, almost all of the participants are part of my blog soul mates circle.  But I'm putting my 2 bits worth anyway, simply because I want to thank all those who participated, who helped, who dropped by and who ultimately made the weekend of fun and games bearable to the people who organized it.  In no particular order, the heroes are:   urlLink Jay , whose word spinning, constant marketing and convincing power helped gather those precious new recruits into the organization as well as help in making a few sales for the group.   urlLink Knight Jinx  whose enthusiam, patience, work ethic and martyrdom made the booth bearable, the load lighter and the event even more fun (and yes, you have a wonderful button KJ;)).  Jylie, a person whom I didn't expect to give such full support, but was a bastion of cheer, wackiness and patience that helped keep the booth upbeat and wonderful (and weird -- hehe).  Elvin, I didn't know you before, but I'm glad I was able to share the, er, booth with you.  I look forward to playing in one of your games.:)   urlLink Tobie who came and helped with demos and contributing eye candy.  His introduction to the world of darkness game helped people see (and for some, even participate) in a more serious role playing game.  Sandor, who came, brought water and chose to spend his birthday helping the booth and doing demos for other table top games.  Jacob, who was our bouncer for the weekend.  And to all the rest who came in to lend support, like the great old One, Nabs, Tommy and other people whose name lingers in my subconscious but due to exchaustion, I plead forgetfulness.  And before I end this, I'd like to thank my sweetie for dragging me out of bed through constant calls at 5 am (I know how difficult it is to wake me), for being patient while you waited and I changed my wardrobe a couple of hundred times, for buying me drinks during the con to  make sure I don't dehydrate and for hugging me when I was about to go crazy with the heat and exhaustion.  It was a wonderful and successful weekend, if not an easy one.  I think its time we plan for the 3rd Con!:)

Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test.

       Worse places to work   Finally, I've found a place worse than mine.     The travel  My little adventure yesterday to the now conquered lands of Quzeon City (cue:  applause) became a nightmare (cue: emphatic aww...).  First off, it was really traffic.  I wish I could say it was in QC, but sadly, the traffic was in Buendia.  I had left Makati at 2 pm, thinking the 2 and a half hour travel would be enough for me to drop off some documents in a client in greenhills, do some client-development chit-chat then move on to E. Rodriguez.  By the time I had left Buendia however, it was already 3:05 pm.  I did what any other conservative would do... I told the taxi (much to his depression) to go to E. Rodriguez straight.   The place  When I finally got to the place at around 4 pm, the first thing I noticed was that it was...fairly depreciated.  Ok, to be more blunt, it looked like a dump and the people, well, they didn't have professionalism in their gait.  Since I was early, I had to sit in sick green chair and watch the receptionist talk on the phone (from the laughter, I gather it wasn't business).  At around 4:10, she finally took notice of me and asked who I my interviewer was.  To her credit, the minute she found out, I was able to be directed to the right floor with a name (not my interviewer) to look for.  It makes me wonder though if precious 10 minutes would have been spared had she been a bit more attentive.  Anyway, there, the HR (so that's what the name was for!) apologized for making me wait.  Perfectly acceptable since I was really due to be interviewed at 4:30.  She made me fill up an application form with, and I apologize beforehand for nit-picking, really bad photocopy of an application form.  I tried to fill it up efficiently, even though I already know as early as that time, that I wouldn't want to work in that place.  Going up the stairs alone and watching the people around me in their seemingly bored Dilbert state, gave me shivers down my spine.  I was just going to finish the interview for politeness sake.   The interview  Met the head of the bank and his next in command.  Something about the head of the bank (a singaporean), which from this moment on I will call Toothy (bad teeth -- go figure)  that seemed to rub me the wrong way.  The next in command, Eye shadow (go figure again) was okay.  She was the first person I sensed some professionalism in.  But the worst was yet to come.  The exchange went this way:   Toothy:  What is the range of salary you expect? Moi:  Is that a trick question (best smile, hoping to break the ice and think at the same time) Toothy:  It may be a trick question but its a question nonetheless.   Really, it was more arrogant if you experience it in person.  There were other things in the 10 minute interview that I blog about but I'm afraid I might ruin the evening.   The position  Eye shadow gave the biggest blow however -- they are evaluating me as a TELLER.  This bank, a non-universal bank, is offering me the position of teller while a universal bank was offering me a position as an ASSISTANT MANAGER.  Humility aside, but I think I'm worth a bit more than that... right?  Maybe not an officer position -- but a teller?   The Conclusion  What do you think?  Its far from where I live, the place is awful, the people don't seem energetic, the boss strikes me as arrogant and the position sucks.  I didn't even finish filling up the application.

       Another Day, Another Opportunity   Today, I'm going to the yet untravelled road called E. Rodriguez for another interview with another bank.  When I mean untravelled, I wasn't exaggerating.  Growing up in Las Pinas and only recently moving to Makati has made me unexposed to the joys of Quezon City, Cubao and anywhere else beyond Megamall.  But, despite the anticipated nightmare of a traffic jam, travel I will to that little known place, if anything, to see if there is a better opportunity there.  It seems that lately, my life has been a question of timing.  There are several things in my foreseeable future that I would like to obtain or get into, but the question of when always haunts my subconscious.  I keep wondering I'll make a big blunder in this intricate timing balance and regret it for the rest of my life.  Like my obtaining an MBA.  I'm currently seriously pursuing a scholarship in one of the more established post graduate schools in Asia.  If I get in, then all my job searching is for naught, since this requires my full attention and the school itself prohibits its students from having any other job.  If I don't get in, then I'll have to take my MBA somewhere in the future when money isn't as tight -- hence getting a better job is critical.  The thing is, I won't know if I get the scholarship until May.  By then, if my interviews goes well, I might possibly be employed in another line of work.  If I am, I'll have to resign, burn some bridges and possibly never forgive myself for leaving something I had committed to even before I get regularized.  But if I don't pursue these interviews now, I might get stuck (heaven forbid) in Audit for at least another 3 months.  And these opportunities may not come in May or June (after all, it would have been just after the elections).  In short, I have no freakin' idea what I should do first and if I should just take a leap of faith and believe (with all my heart) that I'll get that blasted scholarship.  Conservative as I am, I don't know if I have the courage.

       A Deep Breath   Finally, after a long (and I mean long) week, I can finally take a deep breath and say... yep, the first busy season hurdle has been taken cared of.  Now, I'm just spending my time finalizing the packages I will be sending to various countries in the world and prepare for the more difficult new encounter with  the Bank  and pray that somewhere along the way, I won't lose most of my sanity... since there wasn't much to begin with after all.  In the homefront (literally), things have calmed down to civil peace.  Of course, it helps that I spend a whole lot of time at work and our encounters are kept at a minimum, and mostly in public.  I am extremely grateful for all those who sent encouraging words in my time of despair (hehe, drama no), specifically my bro in everything but blood, KJ, my best friend (forever) Jay, my best-bud-blogmate Jet, my college and RPG pal Kirsikka, the D&D guru Baron and of course, my ever-cheerful sweetie Alex.  It seems that the best formula for most pain are friends and work... I am glad I have a great abundance of both...:P

       Painful New Year   While everybody was getting over their respective hang-overs from the new year celebration, I celebrated January 1, 2004 in subdued depression.  The first thing that I heard you see, upon waking up, is my grandmother (who had previously caused my dislocation from my condo unit) meddling into the "core" family affairs.  Her target:  my mother (her daughter-in-law).  Her fodder:  my words.  Her objective:  I have no f***ing idea.  The thing is, my mother and I have always had our differences.  It is only recently that I have learned to cope and accept her for what she is.  While there was a time when I would have claimed with conviction that she hated me because I couldn't live life that way she wanted me to live it, I have now just come to realize that she was committing a common parenting mistake of living her life through me -- as such, my failures become even more painful for her, because she'll always think she would have done differently.  And while to others, this realization would have been seed for more hate, I instead became sympathetic.  After all, I have already convinced myself that she truly did love me, not in the usual fairy tale way that mothers do, but she did. And it wasn't her fault that she grew up without parents, being a middle child and having to fight every step of the way to reach where she is right now.  Enter stage left, my grandmother.  You see, as all mother-in-laws are, apparently, she likes finding mistakes in her children's spouses.  There is also the little issue a couple of months ago when her daughter (my dad's sister, and the aunt I disowned) spread bad rumors about my mom.  But of course, I was not privy to this facet of hers.  I was drunk with the Christmas season and, as my job has trained me to be, was very blatantly honest.  In retrospect, I feel so stupid as to fall for such a simple trap.  In the end, she told my mom half of what I said, in a garbled insulting way and forgot the rest.  And my mother, to this day, hates me for "betraying" her.  My grandmother has left last Friday and is probably having the time of her life back in good ol' Cebu.  While my family, in the meantime, is on the verge of falling apart.  My father, full of good intentions, if nothing else, pushed me and my mother to have a bull session.  In turned into a shouting-crying match.  And my dad, uncharacteristically became illogical and resorted to emotional blackmail to get us to reconcile.  Finally, when I was on the corner of the floor and sobbing, and my mom would not face me, my dad declared (there is no other term for it) that past is past and that's that.  He ordered us to hug (which we did to oblige him) and after that I went upstairs and cried my heart out.  Looking back, perhaps I could have just stayed calm, think Zen thoughts (a paradox in itself, I know) and apologize.  But for some reason, despite the fact that my grandmother didn't say the entire truth, I couldn't back down.  Because deep inside, I know, despite the acceptance, there are still things that I have yet to reconcile with my mom.  Things decades old, but still bleeding.  As for my dad, while I used to look at him as a bastion of sorts, a rock which would not crumble, I now know I cannot trust him with my deepest emotions.  For the simple reason that he too gets emotionally hurt by my troubles and becomes as illogical as I am, when what I need is calm sanity.  And for my grandmother... I feel anger -- an anger that is subsiding even now, for I am losing whatever affection I have had for her.  I know I am being harsh, but the truth of it, is that I never felt so alone as I did yesterday.  And sadly, I don't think things will get better in the near future.  I wonder if all parents fail their children in some way.  Just as children will always be destined to fail their parents in one way or the other.  Perhaps there is a truth to the saying that what you do to your parents your kids will probably do unto you...If for no other reason that you probably will commit the same mistakes  your parents did.  I think Meg Ryan said something along this vein in the Breakfast Club.  Oh well...  Maybe the Chinese New Year will bode better fortunes for me.  For now, all I can do is mope, wallow and work.  Not necessarily in that order. Probably sometimes, all at the same time.

       The Big Cheese   Just a short side-note, up until yesterday, I never did quite feel like a... boss, even if it was a low powered one.  It might have to do with the way our company culture is, or the fact that some of my staff are older than me.  Either way, it was quite a surprise that one of my staff, one I considered a pal, instantly call me on the cell after I expressed annoyance at her leaving before her 9 hours of work was up.  While I know I had a point, I wasn't all that pissed, since she only left around 30 minutes before 6:30, so in the hierarchy of sins, its reasonably venial.  However, she immediately called me up and apologized profusely.  Too profusely.  I don't know if I really like the feeling that people will consider me as something other than a friend.  Then again, professional life would surely take a short-cut to hell if they didn't.  Oh well...   Girlfriend Needs   Recently, a very close friend of mine disclosed that he and his girlfriend had a fight.  The reason:  he wasn't spending enough time with her.  And while I do have reservation with this girl and her methods of, er, communicating her emotions, I did see her point and to be honest, I kinda sided with her.  Maybe its something universal between girlfriends.  I may not like her methods, but I empathize.  I am a firm believer that if you commit to a relationship, you better be ready to commit your time as well.  I'm not saying anything like dedicating your entire life, but a significant amount should still be allocated at the very least.  It is also your duty to try and understand and participate in the respective worlds of your gf/bf.  After all, if you don't, then your journey will remain separate.  What would the relationship be for if it wasn't to spend a part of the trip with your significant other?  Again... oh well...

       Sick and still working   Yesterday, I woke up knowing that it was only a matter of time before I get sick... It was the way my through was sore, my muscles were grumbling and the way my mind simply refused to register the alarm clock as part of the known universe that gave me the hint.  By late yesterday, I was having chills, coughing and was all set to be miserable for the next x number of days that it takes for my body to recover from this viral attack.  But being miserable apparently was not an option.  My sweetie simply refused to allow me to wallow, and instead, picked me up from work, forced me to eat lamb and made me laugh with stories of his work in Hong Kong and all the colorful characters he encountered there.  After that, we watched Babylon 5 at home while he gave me a back rub to soothe the aching muscles away.  Before he left, he made sure I drank enough liquids to keep the fever down and gave me a short lecture on not keeping enough paracetamol in stock.  Today, I woke up later than usual, but feeling marginally better.  Perhaps there is some truth that the best cure is TLC.  And while I still feel feverish (especially when confronted with upcoming deadlines), I am in a way re-energized in the knowledge that someone loved me enough to drag me out of my miserable illness.  So to you my sweet... Thanks...And while I believe your love is enough to cure me anything, I promise to stock more paracetamol...:P

       Part II of II:  Top 10 Secrets to Time Management   Still more from the neurotic auditor    5.  Be nice to the support staff.   Whether it may be the cleaning lady, the secretary or the cranky old coot in-charge of handling ancient documents for your company, it never hurts to sow the seeds of goodwill early on.  Later on, you will reap the benefits of such, especially when you have mastered the I-am-busy-aura and have gone to the next stage, I-am-exhausted-beyond-comprehension facade.  Believe you me, the support staff are more sympathetic than your superiors, and chances are, will help you in the small (but often tedious) things, that, you've got it, take up your time.  It can be as simple as revising a report (Send ko po yung soft copy, edit na lang po yan!); or finding a lost document (sige na po, alam ko nandyan lang po sa area na yan); or even pick up items you have forgotten or have been ordered to do so (sa may Bulacaan lang po yun!).  Either way, they will support you and will help you in any way they can -- and while they don't have the power to promote you, they do have the power to make your life a hell of a lot easier.   4.  Take time for the Friday Night Emails (FNE).   While MME's are destructive to self-esteem and disheartening to the soul, FNE are merely inconvenient.  But annoying as they may be, it is always advisable to sift through the mail you have chosen to not read during the week if only to empty your inbox before you take your well-deserved weekend.  The benefits include lessening  your MME's as well as having a clear conscience when you take your R & R.    3.  Bring Nibbleable snacks and a jug/can of your favorite drink.   While this is possibly destructive to your diet, bringing snacks and drinks to your table help keep you focused on the report on hand.  If you're stuck on a particular problem, eating something or drinking something will give you a few seconds break, and allows you to go back to the problem at hand.  Seemingly, this may contradict the cultivation of the I-am-busy-aura, but you must remember, moving around to get a cup of coffee does not add to the impression of being busy.  It might even give the wrong impression.   2.  Plot your deadlines.   Plot your deadlines in a large piece of paper and post it at your desk.  This way, when your superior approaches you, she will immediately see just how busy you are.  And if she doesn't notice it, you can point her to that direction.  Plot lines on the days you are supposed to do the report instead of just writing down the date a report is due.  This will increase your busy factor by ten fold.   1.  I have 2 Hands.   Once you get it into your head that you are human (repeat it with me:  I am human), then you'll understand that everything has a time and place.  As such, doing something later is not as much as an excuse as long as you do DO it.  At the time you had allotted yourself for doing it.  And for the rest of surprises in between, just remember the old nursery rhyme... "I have 2 hands... the left and the right..."

       Part I of II:  Top 10 Secrets to Time Management   Lesson learned by a neurotic auditor.    10.  Beware of the Monday Morning Emails (MME).   Do not open your email on a Monday morning.  Emails received on Monday morning will only serve to increase stress and blood levels as well as carve out three fourths of your morning replying to each and every neurotic email sent by boss/ client over the weekend.  Monday morning emails loose destructive capability when opened later in the day, or better yet, on a non-Monday day.  Urgent messages will be phoned in (say it with me:  urgent messages will be phoned in).   9.  Utilize your Sunday nightmares.   Instead of opening the MME, list down all the items you have been agonizing over in the weekend, which has made you want to call in sick if only to escape these "chores"/deliverables.  Lists have an added benefit of making insurmountable tasks surmountable (after all, that 50 page report is only one number in your list of to do's -- psychologically, it really works to make you think its that easy).  At the same time, should your boss/client request you to do urgent (but not important) things, you have a ready list of items to use an excuse (good ones at that -- sorry Mr. Smith, but currently, I'm handling the consolidation packages of several companies.  I'll get back to you on that).   8.  Delegate the menial tasks to your boss.   Never give hard copies of your report to your boss.  Instead, forward a soft copy and proceed to other tasks for the day.  This will force your boss to a) Wrestle with the printer himself/herself and b) Edit it on his/her own.  Note, this does not work for all bosses.  However, if you factor in enough "I-am-busy-aura", you just might get away with it.   7.  Cultivate the I-am-busy-aura.   Bring a planner at all times.  When asked if you are free, flip through your planner and mention a date and range of time when you are.  This gives the impression that you are an extremely busy person as well as that your free time is in terms of hours and not days -- particularly important for those urgent one-day reports.  If possible, try not to be in your seat at all times -- go to the fax machine, the printer or anywhere and then come back.  Walk fast strides.  Have that far-away look.  That way, people will know you are otherwise preoccupied.  At the same time, do the old trick of messing up your area.  Its cheesy but it works.   6.  Analyze your boss and the deliverables.   Estimate the difficulty rating of your boss and your report.  Then sort your list (#9) accordingly.  For bosses, you might also want to take into consideration their competency level.     Anyway, that's it for now.  Neurotic auditor must return to cultivating the I-am-busy aura. Will complete this next time.:)

       Breathless Moments   Because after what's happened these past few weeks, and because of what's happening and what's going to happen, I wil take my cue from  urlLink Jet's  blog and list down the moments that make life worth living.  Its been said, life is not measured by the quantity of breaths we take, but the number of moments that make us breathless.  For an auditor, who is on the brink of losing her breath, this is especially important.  After all, sanity hinges on some hope that whatever it is your doing, no matter how much you hate it, its going to be worth it.  In no particular order, here they are:  1)  The first smile I get from my sweetie when I see him. 2)  Eating chicken bbq and java rice (with matching mango shake) in Aristocrat Roxas Blvd (all other aristocrat wannabe's           pale in comparison) 3)  Seeing a bound FS (for those not in the know -- its an auditor thing) 4)  Being able to indulge in Haagan Daaz Brandied Black Cherry (oooohhh.... orgasmic pleasure in a bite!) 5)  Taking my first sip of Mocha Java (instant human coming right up) 6)  Playing board games (and winning! ok, so even when I'm not winning, but its better when I am!:)) 7)  "Drumming" in the arcade. 8)  Curling up in my sweetie's arms and reading a good book. 9)  Playing tennis 10)Shopping (I'm female!  I'm entitled!) 11)Hanging out with friends after arnis (exhaustion brings wonderful conversations) 12)Eating cappucino cake of SBC 13)Eating mango float from Kawanga Kid's kitchen 14)Karaoke 15)Watching musicals 16)Getting neck massages from my sweetie 17)Going to a parlor and having a foot scrub  It just occured to me that most of my  "breathless"  moments have something to do with food.  Oh well, maybe in the maslow's heirchy of needs, I haven't satisfied the basic level yet, as such, I need to eat to satisfy myself.  Or, I'm just really a gourmant (spelled right?).  Whatever.  I'm just glad I have them.

       Love Hurts   To the point of death apparently.  Recently, I had found out that a certain blogger, unable to withstand the realization that his (ex)fiancee could not return his affections, killed himself.  His suicide note was posted in his blog in the form of a letter to his significant other.  Obviously, blogs are terrible in revealing details and I can only assume what's left in between the lines.  But the blog in itself was an irrevocable testament to a life lived - and ended. Posts on his tag board were heartbreaking - friends cursing him to say anything - any thing at all to disclaim the truth that he's dead; people wishing that he rest in peace; directions to his wake.  Links on his blog include a link to a picture gallery of him and his girlfriend.  His previous post to the suicide letter were news about his then, upcoming wedding - he was going to be married on June 5 this year.  Where does love end and obsession begin?  How do you walk the tight-rope of promising to love someone forever, knowing that either he/she and you may change, subtly or abruptly, in middle of that journey?  And most of all, how do you go on if something you worked so hard for, ends, because life is fickle?  I can feel a deep sympathy for the woman who now has to live with the fact that she, no matter how indirectly, contributed to such loss of hope in a man, that he killed himself.  And while logically, the choice was made by someone who had a right to how he wished to live and end his life, logic tends to be a poor bed-fellow in whose arms solace has no place.  As for the blogger, may he rest in peace.  If the internet had ghosts, he might be a likely addition to them.  I still pray not, however. May he be free.

       Deadlines be Damned   Its my birthday, so I think I deserve a little break... at least to write up a birthday blog.  Wow, its been sometime since I've updated this thing.  According to the blog history, last time I updated was Feb 10, almost a month ago.  Sigh, it just goes to show how bad the busy season could be.  It hasn't all been "work" however.  In between I have attended the launch of Siglo: Freedom (a little late to advertise, but I think I will send you copy Jet, if you'd email me your address!:)), endured a boss I have wanted to murder for the better half of February, studied for the GMAT and wrote the first chapter of a short story.  The price of course, for all this productivity, is lack of sleep and over-all crankiness.  But none of that today.  Today, I will honor the people who have made me look forward to being 24 and has made me love being 23.  In no particular order, here they are:  Jay, the Pointyman himself, the love machine and my best friend.  You were always there with wry (sometime brutal, but who cares) humor that has made me look see the lighter side of Life, even in the saddest of moments.  Lenny, my bro in everyting but blood.  You were always there for me, showing me that sometimes, you just have to take things easy and live a little.  Elaine, who probably will never see this blog, but who has made my work life bearable with your little gifts of thoughtfulness.  I will never forget the sundae you gave me during the worst night of February, when there was no aircon and I didn't have time to go for dinner.  The sundae was more than just a coolant then... it was a reminder that people do care.  And of course my sweetie.  You made me laugh and cry and on over-all, love being who I am because it meant I am loved by you...  And to those whom I have failed to mention, always know that you are in my hearts and only my inadequacy with words have prevented me from mentioning you by name.  Thank you people.:)

       The Path of Spirituality   Spirituality is something I deal with on a daily basis since I was old enough attend the exclusive, Catholic school in Taft.  At an early age, they were already explaining the basis of our religion by utilizing our lack of knowledge of the world, then the foundations on why we have such faith and how we can use this to pray for protection and blessing, and finally, when they have deemed we were old enough (or perhaps too old to believe that the world was created in 7 dyas), the reason why in some things we'll just have to believe despite the fact that there is no proof.    I guess it is very much the same with the world, in a much larger level.  We created religion to explain what we, ourselves could not explain - Deat, Life, great disasters, Fortune and everything in between.  After all, whatever is beyond us must be something bigger, something mightier and something ultimately deserving of worship than us mortals.  Now that the world is running out of things to explain, and our belief in our capabilities expands and increases with each new era, we have turn away from prayers for an explanation, but instead we begin beseaching for protection.  I wonder if the future will contain a type of spirituality where it is no longer dependent on explanations and protection, but on our reaching out to that thing bigger, mightier and deserving of, if not worship, but connection.  In that time, everything would be explained.  We would be capable of protecting ourselves on our own without an outwardly power.  But we would reach out within ourselves to reach out beyond ourselves, that which we will have to believe is there, despite the lack of proof.  Maybe that is the highest form of spirituality.  A religionless yearning to be part of the greater energy that connects every living thing in this universe.  After all, in the end, we were created from something - by someone.  And after all the explanations, I think that will still remain.

       BLOGGER REVIVED   For the past few weeks, blogger and the related blogspots, would not appear on my internet.  I had feared the worst:  that our evil system administrator had blocked the site forever on KPMG internet.  I also entertained the thought of some uber spybot selfish enough to prevent me from going to blogspot but allows me to access other sites, like Dean's journal.  In the end, after weeks of no blog access, the site came alive a few minutes ago.  It was a fast download, it was a wonderful site to behold (no pun intended) and most importantly it was there - so triple YIPPEE!   Writing Blues   Today is the day before the deadline for the Palancas.  This is also the day I have decided not to submit my sad little stories.  For one thing, it just isn't ready.  The busy season took such a toll on me that I can't even say my grammar is perfect.  For another, I don't have the time to do all the little things to prepare it (notary and all that).  Oh well, there's always next year.   Wirting Reds   On a good note, I've started writing my first ever comic!  Due to my sweetie's constant bombardment of trade paper backs (which he deviously would "leave" in my room, knowing my propensity to read anything at the first stroke of boredome), I've finally decided to try my hand in writing one.  Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done.  Its so different having to think and therefore write, in panels.  I'm glad that my good friend Nicco was patient enough to go through the motioins with me, panel, by panel.  There were so many times I wanted to skip ahead ("But what happens in between that k8?") or simply didn't have the foggiest idea how to translate into picture the word "regret" or "fear".  But that's where the artist comes in and I'm just so grateful I can just say "It's you ball" whenever the piture isn't clear to me.  Within the week, I will be receiving the first complete draft of the story and it will be my turn to turn prose to, well, comic prose.  Wish me luck!

        Amalgam of Thoughts     On My Own   With nothing to do.  With no place to go.  With no one to talk to. Was - incredibly - wonderful.  Short as it may be.  Yesterday, I took my lunch break to Glorrietta, carrying my working papers, ready to do a special delivery after lunch time to one of my clients.  It was liberating to be by myself - not that I'm the loner type.  But being able to wander without worrying of being late or of where to go.  Not worrying about saying something witty or looking attentive.  Not bothering to fix my face or wonder about my companion and his/her boredome.  Just by myself, free from everything - even work.  If only for a little under an hour.  Perhaps this is how close I can be to what Dean says about Mini Stops.  Of course, I do realize this is a priviledge best enjoyed in small doses.  Mostly because my personality can only stand a few moments of purposelessness - more than that, I'd go insane.  But it was still nice to get away from work and journey in a crowded mall by myself.     Almost Done   Ok, I'm standing in front of the finish line about ready to cross it - but can't.  My hurdle is one mean, unfortunately, extremely competent partner who did not want to release my FS due to lack of faith.  In the audit team (us), in the client (well, uh, the client) and in partner (her peer).  Exactly what an auditor should be.  I just can't help but wish she didn't have to question us so close to deadline. Oh well, can't do anything but wait.  And wait... and wait....

       Almost at the Finish Line   And nearly running out of breath.    I'm tired.  I'm irritated.  I'm cranky.  And the only thing keeping me in this rat race is the fact that April 15 will soon come and with it - blessed vacation.  At the same time, its enough to make me hyperventilate at night knowing April 15 is coming and my work still seems like a mountain yet unconquered.  Ironic isn't it?  What's even worse is that the work is really more on my staff's side, I can do no more than wait in the sidelines until the baton is passed on to me.  I suppose I could do the work myself -- only a few things hinder me from doing so - first of which is that all the files are with him.  Second of which, he has this annoying tendency to want to finish things himself and will wihhold documents from me until its completely done.  And third, although equally as important, if he doesn't do this, how will he learn?  Now, more than ever, I realize how difficult it is to be friends with an office mate who technically is under your resonsibility, be at awe at his intelligence and be disappointed with his work habits.  Most of the time, his work is above par.  And yet, the sometimes (getting more frequent lately) that he fails to do so, because of he had to make amends with his girlfriend (fighting apparently is their favorite past time) or has to talk to his sister because she's depressed, and all the other family/ loved ones problems that pop up in the worst of times, makes me want to  commit murder.  I want to understand.  I really do.  And, the part of me that is his friend, really does.  I don't doubt he's undergoing a lot of things, but our work isn't going to automatically complete itself. How do you understand without sacrificing the work?  God, I'm really, really afraid that the day will come where I'll have to put my foot down and say, No, you have to finish what you have committed yourself to finish.  I hope I never have to.  I know I will regret it and hate myself afterwards.

       What Could Have Been    What's written below was supposed to be my entry to the prestigious Palanca awards.  As you may read, its far from being ready.  However, since I'm not joining anyway, I humbly ask you all readers to give my your comments so that I may learn from this experience.  And who knows?  Maybe next time, I can actually do better.:)  I.    The world was changing.  It was the year 2015.  The Philippine Parliament, in a close vote, had decided to ally the country with the Americans against the growing conflict with the European Consolidate.  Shortly after, several blackouts occurred, people disappeared and soldiers began to walk the streets.  Our soldiers.  American soldiers.  It was a subtle change, but even subtlety, if persistent becomes overt.    At first, the blackouts were deemed an annoyance, another something to talk about and bitch about in the daily routine of life.  But slowly, the length of each blackout, the sheer randomness of it, and the apparent ineptitude of the government to prevent it sowed the seeds of panic.  The growing number of soldiers, whether ally or countryman, did nothing but nurture the terror.  And when barricades and random checkpoints on various national highways began to sprout, the rumors, once whispered in hushed tones, began to travel the country grapevine in a near shout.  I was 12 when the first devastating attack was made to the country.  It didn’t take the form of bombs or firepower.  Instead, it was another blackout both the electrical and informational kind.  During one of the black-outs, several key journalists and politicians, known for their anti-war platforms disappeared.  The timing could not even be more obvious - it came at a time just after the first American bomb was dropped on French soil.  What that could mean drove people to a near frenzy.   News were hazy at best… the Philippine Government promises to resolve this problem…. power will resume within the day…apparently, a group of jellyfishes short-circuited the hydroelectric power plant… the hostage takers will be punished.  On the 135th day of investigation into the disappearance and during one of the usual black-outs, my mother chose to give birth to my sister.  Tita Pinky was running all over the house, ordering the small group of people we had taken under our care to get more water, more candles, blankets and the like.  I was not spared from these commands.  However, having undergone the first 12 years of my life as the only son of a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman, I didn’t feel like being cooperative.  In the innocence of youth, I had not truly understood what the events meant for me.  Funny, how youth does that.  “What do I know about these things anyway Tita?”  I asked irritably.  I was playing piko with my friends outside when she called me in to help out.  “You know how to get blankets and water and candles Mark.”  Tita Pinky explained calmly, even as she roughly pulled my elbow towards the big house.  “But the maids can do it.  Yaya Daday can do it.”  I insisted, as I tried to pull out of her grasp.  “Mark!”  Immediately, I stopped struggling.  I was too afraid to look at her, especially with the tone of voice that she used.  But I was also too proud to be humbled.  I sulked and pouted even as she slapped my arm.  “You’re mama is giving birth right now Mark.  Don’t you understand that she is in a lot of pain?”  I bit my lower lip.  Deep inside I knew she was right, but I am too proud to admit it. “Why don’t you bring her to the hospital?”  I mumbled with a burst of courage.  Tita Pinky took my chin and not too gently pushed it up until I had no choice to but to look at her.  At that time, I thought she was trying to punish me, but in retrospect, I believe it was her way of trying to make me understand.  That things are different from before.  That my once privileged lifestyle was a thing of the past and that we must inevitably change along with the world.  “Mark, the hospitals have problems of their own. Besides, it’s not safe to go out anymore. Don’t you wonder why your father is not home yet?  I shudder to think was has befallen him Mark.  Let’s no make the same mistake with your mother.”  She had made a sign of the cross then, while I felt the first trickle of tears fall down on my cheek.  I didn’t want to believe what she was implying with my father.  Many people have disappeared during the last few months, but surely my father would come back, right?  Even Mama said he would.  And mama never lies.  I entered the house to see it all dark.  The sun was setting at that time and all candles were being reallocated to major hallways leading to my mother’s room.  Everywhere around me, people seemed to be moving around.  Yaya Daday was climbing down the stairs with a blackened kettle, obviously with the intent of getting more water.  The other maids were busy lighting candles, cooking soup, bringing blankets and the like.  Our Mayordoma Noning came to meet Tita Pinky with a frightened look in her eyes.  “It’s not good Madam.  The  Albularyo  says that she is too thin, too frail to give birth.  He doesn’t know if she’ll survive the night.”  Tita Pinky searched for my hand and squeezed it.  It felt as if somebody else was squeezing my heart.  “Don’t say that Noning.  She will survive.”  Tita Pinky pushed me towards the stairs.  “Go Mark.  Get the chest in my room and bring it to me.  Hurry!”  My eyes were red with tears but somehow I was able to move.  I got to her room hearing nothing more from Noning and Tita Pinky, and hearing more screams from my mother.  Quietly, I crouched to my knees and took the chest from underneath her bed as I tried to block out the sound.  It was fairly heavy for a medium sized chest, but I was in no way, frail of built, and I managed to pull the object onto the bed easily enough.  I felt some surprise that it was not locked.  In the past, it was only the lock that had prevented me from looking inside.  Curiosity kept me distracted and I opened the box almost without hesitation.  “So you’ve found it Mark.”  The lid fell back, narrowly missing my fingers.  Tita Pinky came towards me and opened the chest, almost reverently.  Inside were treasures whose value I would only know much later.  But then, they were nothing but some soft cloths, shiny stones… and candles of all shapes and sizes.  She took one pineapple shaped candle and gave it to me with a wistful smile.  “Smell this Mark.”  I took a sniff and oddly enough, it smelled like cotton candy.    “It smells wonderful doesn’t it?”  She took another larger candle, its colored wax swirling against the dying sunlight and cradled it gently in her slender hands. “I collected these the past couple of years.  I never used them because I was afraid that they would disappear ---“  Another scream echoed into her room.  Tita Pinky’s face lost its smile.  Efficiently, she filled my hands with various candles.  She closed the chest and hid back underneath her bed.  “C’mon Mark.  We must hurry to your mama.”  She ushered me into the master’s bedroom.  There, people were coming in and out, bringing hot water, funny smelling soup and some herbs.  Tita Pinky ushered me inside.  I hesitated, not knowing if I wanted to see what was beyond the doors. More importantly, I didn’t want to recognize the person behind the screams.  Another push from tita Pinky and I was inside.  The room smelled like medicine.  This wasn’t my mama’s room, which had always reminded me of roses.  This was something else. And surely the woman, so deathly pale and thin on the bed was somebody else as well.  I looked at my tita for comfort, but I could not find solace in her face.  I looked back at the person I call mama.  Tita Pinky took the candles from my hands and began to spread them out, lighting them one by one.  As if on cue, the smell of medicine became less pungent and the room began to take on a different light.  My mother was moaning still, but I felt she found some comfort from the scented candles.  My tita would tell me later that it was my presence that comforted her.  I didn’t even know she saw me.  The Albularyo was telling my mother to push.  Another of my tita’s was holding her hand and praying the rosary.  Tita Pinky took a wet cloth from the nearby basin and wiped my mother’s brow.  And still there I stood, inside but not quite in, looking at my mother bathed in candlelight.  My mother did not die that night.  She died the next day.  But not before she had given life and name to my sister.  Her last word was Gabrielle.

       Makati Living   (Top 10 Lessons you learn working, living, breathing in Makati Part 1)   In the tradition of my old top 10 time management lessons, I figured I might as well do a small piece to the lessons I've leanred in Makati.  In truth, these are things that are probably applicable to other cities, but no other city teaches it like Makati...   10.  Open Your Bag For Inspection   Or at least a portion of it at least.  What's truly terrorizing is that security rarely checks  all   bags and rarely do they check it thoroughly.  If you volunteer to open a portion of your bag, even if you have other unsearched pockets, it wouldn't matter.  Although I might add, that this might only work with beautiful, sexy, women like yours truly (duck for any flying tomato).  Seriously though, the amount of screening a bag can get is directly proportional to good grooming.  Which brings me to my next tip.  9 .  Good grooming for less interruption .  Security guards and other personnel are commonly human (at other times, containing an intelligence below our specie, but approximates a human nonetheless).  They tend to get intimidated to at least hesitate, before questioning anyone who looks like they own the place - and dresses like it too.  Word of advice though - getting down from a jeepney in front of the building lessens your "porma effect", no matter how good you look.   8.  Wear an ID   No matter what building you want to go to, wear an ID, preferably with a generic ID clip/cord.  It doesn't matter if its not an ID from that building.  Philippine culture prescribes that we, as an employee, are incredibly shy about our pictures, and as such, if required to show it (like in an ID) will wear it reversed.  We also tend to not wear the prescribed ID cord.  So if you enter with an ID, generic ID clip, and with an aura of someone used to going in that building, you may never have to get a visitor's pass anymore.   7.  Get your walking shoes ready.   If you will have to do any travelling within Makati, better change shoes, bring shades and get ready to do some walkin.  Makati traffic laws are incredibly complex and are prone to change every week or so.  Traffic is also unpredictable - 5 minutes, it may be smooth sailing, another 5, and it would look like all Hell broke loose.  Makati is however, blessed with a decent walkway system.  You may have to shift though from underpass to overpass, and eventually, you will have to walk the streets, but all things considered, if you don't want to pay the taxi fare/gas and get frustrated anyway, do the walk.  There are even vendo machines along walkways as well as ATM's should the thirst for liquid or money claim you before you reach the end of your journey.   6.  Know where to park   Makati also has the strictest, most merciless towing service known to man and womankind.  Meter maids, despite being deceptively small and submissive, can curse like a sailor and are always one radio away from back-up - believe me.  I've seen it happen numerous times in this call-center city.  Don't fight it out.  Say yes and then get ready to pay the fine and next time, park where no spiteful meter maid can call your attention to.

      Sometimes, you wonder about the things you've lost and the things you've gained and the things you're not certain you have.  And in those times, if you're lucky, you'll realize that you have all that you'll need, even if only for that moment.  Most of the time however, fear creeps up with sure-footed grace, moving to the corners of a mind inclined to doubt because of its humanity.  And I guess, I'm not very lucky today.  Is it really worth being strong, and being proud if the price it demands are insecurities that cannot be assuaged by the light of consolation?  And still, how could I not be strong or proud, when too many times, vulnerability was met with nothing but rejection or disdain?  Times like these, I feel like I’m playing a game where I must win, not because I want to, but because losing is out of the question.  But I can’t help but wish that it wasn’t a game. That somehow, I still had the innocence of one who wasn’t left broken far too much for far too long.  In an ideal world, things would be much simpler.  It would be black and white.  You’d want what you have, hope for more and actually have faith that you’ll get it and poetry would not be wasted. But its not an ideal world, it’s the real world.  And in the one I’m currently moving in, risks have to be taken.  Real risks.  Real consequences.  I wonder if I have the courage to actually do the jump one more time.  For the sake of love, passion, beauty and all the things we’ve heard about, felt at one time or the other but, for most of the people around me, have not been able to keep.  Or should I just continue with the pretense, with the safe choices, with the proud decisions that will keep my precious fears close to me, like the chains and bonds that they have become but at least, I am without pain.    Soon, another hard decision will have to be made.  And it is these decisions, that moment between forever and goodbye that will test the real strength of character a person has.  But for now, I shall dwell in my cowardice and keep my insecurities closer to my heart than the dreams I want to fulfill.    Brave are only the few, and only for a few moments.  My moment has yet to come.

      There is that split second of extreme regret, which, eventually gets tempered down by sobriety in the course of my entering the office of KPMG.  Within these drab walls, messy tables and insomniac workaholics I have cried, laughed, screamed, ranted and most of all, learned from the plethora of experiences I was forced to swallow, ready or not.  And yet, while I now see that this life as generally better than when I was leading it, I have no compunction that it was a life I would have had to let go... The sooner, the better.  After all, ambition and hard work can only get you up to a certain point - the rest will have to be driven by desire and passion for both the journey and the destination; both of which I seriously doubt I have.  But still, I do feel some yearning.  There is a different energy when you are working with accountants, despite common knowledge (I'm serious!).  After all, accountants, young ones at that, usually have an admirable work ethic, realistic expectations, determination to move mountains and most of all, all kinds of chewy snacks for the probable food emergency.  And while tempers will rise, egos will fall and tears will drown everything else during the busy season, it is also the most rewarding experience (at least, on the team level, lately I have doubts top management sees any gratification in the accomplishment).  Now, I will write my last blog in this laptop, say goodbye to the delapidated ID I've worn since I came in and generally bid my farewells to a type of life I've led.  I've made my choice.  Now all that's left is to live through the journey I chose.

      Last night, we had the now becoming regular game of Isle.    Last night, I played with an injured foot from a stupid umbrella.  And last night, I was close to tears as my character went through some pretty major stuff from losing the friendship of her ex-master/teacher to almost dying.  Now, in the sober light of day, I begin rethinking the game and how I acted in it.  Contrary to how this blog started, I'm not actually going to speak of theories and game nuances and all the things are better told in person (with accompanying gestures and impersonations) but actually how I react to certain things.  I hope to somehow (although I know I'm a bit too optimistic to wish for this) that after this blog, I would find a little self-realization of why I act to certain stimuli as such.  I've always considered myself an emotional person with the unfortunate curse of having to much empathy.  In short, I care too much.  Although I know a lot of people who know me to certain extent would disagree and actually say I think to much and care too little (especially people at work), what they don't know is that I feel a little too much.  In a good way, it helps me understand people.  Hence, I'd like to think that I have a greater capacity than the average person to forgive.  On the bad side, I sometimes get so emotional that I end up being self-righteous, outspoken and generally a crybaby.  And this kind of empathy is not something I turn on and off.  I tend to feel the same extent of emotion even if I know it is fiction or real.  I remember the first time I cried because of a book.  I was 10 and I was reading a rather old copy of Danielle Steel's Fine Things.  And, in the middle of the book, when the wife of the hero died, I cried and cried buckets of tears until the pages and the words were blurred.  On the flip side, I also feel pain even if I don't experience it.  As such, people tend to not ask me to, er, tend (I know, redundant) their wounds, since I'd probably grimace more than they would (and scream and shout and probably shudder all the way).  Even stories that I hear can bring me to tears, like when Jay told me about his 2 fortune lobsters that he had unwittingly put in a tank of fish.  It wouldn't have been a problem had the lobsters not shed their skin, leaving them unprotected and the fish having the free for all at them.   In RPG's, I remember crying in my first game when, in the Legend of the Five Rings, my father died (I still take that against you Jay!).  And now in Dean's game, I was close to tears because of what my character had to go through.  Aaagh... I do feel embarrassed to care so much.  But I just can't help it.  Emotion seems to be something I cannot distance myself from, no matter how logically easy it may seem.  It's just something I have to live with until such time I can actually learn where the switch to this empathy thing is.

       urlLink Dean's  game is making me think more than it should...  I actually dreamt of the craftsmen/women last night... although whatever enlightenment I must have gained in dreamland, stayed in dreamland.  Alas, I am left with nothing but a distant memory of some man weilding some tool of craft in some positive manner at me... Yeah I know, big help, right?  But it did make me want to rethink my theories.   One of our greatest revelations to date, was to find out that the benevolent Godess/ruler  Widow  (from our time/place) has been transformed into the  Dowager  in the time/place we are in - and this time, she's evil.  Intrestingly enough, I found out that the widow actually came from the latin word  videre  meaning to separate.  Obviously, the current meaning for widow is a woman who has lost her husband by death and usually has not remarried.  Dowager on the other hand means a widow holding property or a title from her deceased husband.   urlLink KK's  theory is that there one was a ruler of sorts that owned Isle, all of Isle.  Hence, the title of Widow/Dowager.  I, on the other hand, believe that perhaps the Widow is merely a title that represent someone whose power is tied to the land.  And since Isle itself is "separate" from anything, anywhere and possibly even anytime else, she was given the title of Widow.   urlLink Nikki  thinks its a link between the land and the Widow, a link that could go as far as marriage.  Sigh, sigh... can't wait for the next game...Till then, I'll be waiting for some corn-haired muse to wave at me.

      Here I am, experiencing my first Monday in my new workplace.  Last week, I had my first Wednesday, Thursday and TGIF moments.  But while my week still has one more first (Tuesday!), I'm already feeling bored... suffocated... at times hesitant but mostly bored.  I gave up the "hard life" in audit in exchange for time for myself and a bit more cash.  What I got, was truly not what I expected.  I didn't expect to be using a computer that I highly suspect to be older than my 13 year old brother... ok, maybe just as old.  I didn't expect to have a daily battle with my desk, since, for some reason, the drawers refuse to open unless you exert the most precise tap and tug technique known to human kind.  I also didn't expect to be writing on long worksheets which I had once naively thought were extinct thanks to Microsoft Excel.  But I also didn't think that it would be so nice to walk to Greenbelt while the sun is still up.  Or that going home knowing there are no pressing deadlines awaits you back in the office actually reduces stress lines.  Or that knowing no client will call you to annoy you with mundane questions can be intoxicating freedom.  Oh well... nothing is certain right now.  And who knows, maybe I will one day (perhaps on my second Wednesday) shoot the old table with a machine gun and throw the ancient PC out the window and use the annoyingly yellow worksheets for a bonfire and after all that, just quit.  Or I may get the hang of the sunset and finally reconcile with my old table whatever our differences were, and have my peace with my PC.  Either way, its only the start of the journey.  And I still have things that I'm certain I love - my Mahal, my family, the GB crew, Great Stories, Text Twist, Aristocrat Chicken BBQ with java rice... and maybe they'll be enough for me to weather the dark doubtful days of my youth.

       Crossroads   I know I probably shouldn’t gripe about opportunities, but being who I am, I can’t help but wonder if I’m making the right decisions.  Today, I received an offer to go to the US, specifically for New York, on a short-term secondment.  This means that I will work in the NY KPMG office for six months and then go back to the local office and work for a year.  All of it translates that I will have to stay for another year and a half in audit, but it would do wonders to my career.  Imagine, having the opportunity to work in a NY office, all expenses paid, with a salary to be provided by NY office themselves (translation:  earning 5000 USD x 5 months).  It’s a wonderful financial and career move!  And I turned it down.  Tomorrow, I start working in a local universal bank.  It pays more, not necessarily well than my local job here, and has considerably less work, but I do wonder.  Am I doing the right thing?  What if my chance at having everything is taking this chance to NY?  It would mean leaving everything I love behind for 5 months – my sweetie, my family, everything that I know to come back and not know what to expect.  It would also mean staying for another year here in the-office-from-hell, where I will have to face the inevitable insanity of the busy season.    Why did I turn it down?  I know what my mind is telling me.  I can’t stay for another year.  Its cold in NY.  Most of all, do I really want the kind of career the opportunity will give me?  Now I feel more than ever that I may have taken the safer, more traveled road.  If I’m regretting this even now, how much more will I regret it later?  I can’t help but wish I could see the future.  I sure as h*** need it.  I’m doing the right thing, right?  I mean, I can still succeed on my own time, right?  I can’t help but hope now that my other job prospect prospers.  That one will hopefully train me abroad, and pay me enough to compensate me for my troubles.  I just wish I felt good about this decision.

       Friday Night Gaming   Last Friday was a new gaming experience for me. It was my first time to, uh, play with Dean and Nikki (no dirty innuendo intended). And it was also my first time to play an RPG without any stats whatsoever.  Truth be told, I had my doubts.  Being an auditor trained me that everything has boundaries.  And as a gamer, I've been trained that stats are the boundaries you set so that your players don't end up becoming demi-gods.  But despite my hesitancy, the initiation to a narrativist style of gaming was successful and more importantly fun.  Dean described a fascinating world where I was almost tempted to just not play a character and just ask him to continue the story-telling.  That was how wonderful the setting was.  Of course, the success of the story could also be attributed to having such wonderful gamers playing as well.  Alex was true to form to his bookish/geekish noble and Nikki role-played her assertive dilettante (sort of) character so well that both roles became alive, and not merely a stereotype.  Now I can't wait to know what happens next in the story.  Thanks for a wonderful game Dean!

       Goodbye Audit   I have the next couple of days left before my resignation takes effect.  I'm meeting the idea of giving up my career for the past 2 years with mixed feelings.  On one hand, I'm relieved - NO MORE BUSY SEASON!.  On the other, I'm sad - no laptop, no rowdy officemates, no incredibly fun christmas parties, no more free dinners, but most of all, NO MORE BUSY SEASON.  Such is the nature of decisions I guess.  I believe that there are a certain few who can always see the good in everything.  And while this may seem like a gift, it's a liability when you have to make important decisions.  After all, if you can see the good in two options, how would you choose?  What criteria would prevail?  Unfortunately, I am one of those people who can't decide, because I simply don't know better.  But decisions will still have to be made.  Now here I am with mine, reconciling with myself the bitterness of goodbye with the excitement of a new, uncertain beginning.  I know I made the right decision... right?

      Yesterday, I&nbsp;deposited a rather abnormal sum (and by abnormal I mean something ridiculously divided like P10, 853.70) to BPI Main Branch in payment of  urlLink our &nbsp;hosting.&nbsp; In retrospect, the entire experience seemed bad from the start.  &nbsp;  First, the ATM's refuses to dispence anything but 500's and only up to P5,000.&nbsp; And so I had to withdraw P11K to pay that abnormal amount.&nbsp; And then I filled up the forms - only to find out that everybody was using the chained pen, and the only free one can barely reach the free space I have to write on.&nbsp; I manage - somehow.&nbsp; I then had to line up in the longest 3 person line ever - I'm not kidding - even people who arrived later were able to finish their business in less than 10 minutes.&nbsp; I mentally pray for patience.&nbsp; Finally, it's my turn.&nbsp; I give the deposit slip and the money, fully expecting to get exact change from the bank.  &nbsp;  I was wrong.  &nbsp;  Instead, the teller gave me P0.30 centavos short.&nbsp; I know, it ain't a large sum of money, and truth be told, I didn't complain because I was just to tired with the experience, but I can't help but feel annoyed.&nbsp; I'm an auditor.&nbsp; I know that that P0.30 centavos won't go to the bank (because what the teller recorded was the amount in my deposit slip) and it obviously didn't go to my pocket either (even if it is rightfully mine).&nbsp; Instead, it will go to the teller.&nbsp; And if you know the volume of transactions a teller a day handles, you'd realize that she might actually be getting a rather large sum of money.  &nbsp;  Realistically though, I know that they (meaning the tellers)&nbsp;use the change to offset their shortages.&nbsp; A part of me does empathize with tellers - if they make a mistake, which isn't so far fetched with the volume of transactions I mentioned earlier, they have to pay.&nbsp; And to think they aren't getting paid as much.  &nbsp;  But the principle of it bothers me.&nbsp; They're a bank, they should have exact change.&nbsp; I mean, when I can expect more accurate change from a sari-sari store than a universal bank, there's gotta be a problem, right?&nbsp; And while I realize that it is only P.30 centavos and it will off-set some of the losses she will make, I don't think short-changing people is the answer either.  &nbsp;  I wish I demanded for the P0.30 centavos.&nbsp; But then again, the worth of it isn't really worth much more - but that's a problem to be discussed in another blog.&nbsp; Right now, I'm just really, really annoyed.

       Found this on   urlLink  Jay's blog   &nbsp;and I just couldn't resist postng this, simply because, being quite ignorant on who   urlLink  Ayn Rand    is (except as knowng her as an author of a little complicated book of Atlas Shrugged),&nbsp; I just had to research her to fully understand the results.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; for the record,&nbsp;I care too much about what people thin (as most of you know) but I'm startnig to realize that it's really quite difficult to keep my opinions to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the test, tell me your results!:)  &nbsp; Wackiness: 20/100 Rationality: 60/100 Constructiveness: 58/100 Leadership: 64/100   You are an SRCL--Sober Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you an Ayn Rand ideal. Taggart? Roark? Galt? You are all of these. You were born to lead. You may not be particularly exciting, but you have a strange charisma--born of intellect and personal drive--that people begin to notice when they have been around you a while. You don't like to compromise, but you recognize when you have to.You care absolutely nothing what other people think, and this somehow attracts people to you. Treat them well, use them wisely, and ascend to your rightful rank.

      I was informed last night that another of my ex’s has decided to get married, with the ETW (estimated time of wedding) to be around mid next year.  This is the second time I’ve heard of one of my past boyfriends finally readying themselves to take that giant leap into forever.  While some ex-girlfriends would probably get a tiny bit jealous, some would be envious, others would be happy and still others wouldn’t care, I can’t help but feel a little nostalgic.  Before I graduated from college, I’ve had 4 proposals of marriage.  To be more accurate, I’ve had 2 normal proposals (with rings and all) and 2 my-best-friend’s-wedding compacts (if-I’m-27-and-I’m-not-married – y’know how it goes).  I have no regrets, and am in fact sort of glad that I took all these things with the seriousness of a teenager – which isn’t much in retrospect.    I'm also happy that life has treated them well.  Call it some fool's curse or something, but I've always seemed to have been with a guy at the worst time of their lives - seriously.  And when we break up, it usually means that in a few weeks to a few months time, things will be better for them.  I can't see the same situation with Alex, but, take for example my first relationship (and the one who is about to get married mid-next year).  He's the youngest son of a wealthy chinese family.  We were young and broke, so I, in my passionate foolishness, would go all the way from Las Pinas to San Juan (no joke, considering this was behind my parent's back, and I didn't know how to commute).  Ironically, after we broke up, his parents provided him with a car and his own business.  The other dude was undergoing a lot of pressure with his new business.  He was also broke, and as such, I had to shoulder many an expense and accept the fact that birthdays and holidays will only get me a kiss and a hug but no other material gifts.  After we broke up, his business took off, and now, he exports to some fancy German school among others has 3 new cars and is also getting married (I assume en grande style) within the next 2 to 3 years.  There was a time I was bothered by this pattern, but lately I just comforted myself by saying I contributed to whatever made them succeed - with both the support I gave and the pain that was our relationship.  All I can hope for is more happiness to them - as much happiness as I have with Alex.

      It's sad to know that most things, even the good, great things that shouldn't end, still do.  I've read many blogs and many essays on the loss of friendship, and yet none of them could prepare me for this feeling of loss.  It's almost as if I've been ripped apart somewhere deep, and while I partly deny the phenomenon, I had also, partly held on even when holding on meant being angry, throwing guilt trips and making unreasonable demands.  I see that I'm wrong now.  So this blog is for you, my friend and brother.  No matter how much it hurts, I'll let you go.  You are still the nicest person I know, and as such holds my highest regard and my unwavering loyalty.  I'm sorry for asking too much this past few months but I guess I was merely foolish in thinking that our friendship could withstand hatred.    We were just unlucky that things are the way they are.  A part of me still wishes that you could overcome your anger  because  of me and the rest of the people who care very much for you, but I realize now that its not reasonable to expect it from you.  Anger is a difficult medicine to swallow, much less forget.  But understanding is much easily given, especially to those we love. So this I give to you.  Forgive me if I will not let go of the things that you hate. Just know that I will be here if and when you come back, ready to tolerate, forgive and forget.  We have new beginnings ahead of us.  Yours mostly away from me, mine having to deal with the fact of letting you go.  But I still love you and I know you will never truly, permanently leave. At least, that is what I hope.  Till then,  goodbye.

      A couple of days ago, I came to work only to find 3 rolls of toilet tissue paper on my table, neatly stacked.  Thinking it was probably someone else's, I immediately questioned the witnesses around me should they know to whom they belong to.  One of my officemates answered, quite seriously, that that (the tissue paper) was part of our benefits in the bank.  Thinking how ridiculous that sounded, I laughed.  She didn't.  And then, she showed my her rolls of tissue paper.  Apparently, we are given a roll of tissue paper a month.  Man, the world here is weird.  Other curious benefits we have is to receive 3-4 (depending on the harvest) semi-ripe mangoes a year.  This is in lieu of a fruit basket during Christmas.  I'm still laughing my head off.

      For the past years I have always blamed my extreme insecurity on an ex-boyfriend who did nothing but criticize me for the things I’m not.  Being idealistic and foolishly in-love I tried to become everything he wanted me to be but still, I fell short of his expectations.  After all, whitening creams and growth balls can only go so far.  But I realized, over the weekend  trip to attend my cousin’s wedding in Bagio, that my insecurity has deeper roots – my family.  All my life I have lived under the shadow of several cousins.  One was the valedictorian beauty queen who later on went to graduate with a double degree from UP with honors.  The other was a pretty and independent nurse who managed to earn P100K a month at age 20 through sales. The other over-achieving cousin was both a model and the regional tennis champ (tennis is the clan sport).  This is not counting the cousins in the States who have either married well or earns more money in a month’s work than an average manager in this country earns in a year.  It also helps that those cousins are sons/daughters of the more “influencial” members of the Clan, having gained such power due to the fact that they are the ones half-supporting the less sterling members back here in the Phils.  So you can imagine how I grew up with my family contemporaries.  I was never complimented at all.  I’m literally saying Never.  It was always someone else who was the pretty one, the smart one, the independent one, the sporty one.  I didn’t even get the polite compliments received by my balik-bayan cousins whenever they arrive for a visit  like, “Gumanda ka!” or “Ang tangkad mo na.”  However, when I lost considerable weight upon entering college, the comments were never-ending “Para ka ng anorexic!” and “Sobrang payat ka na!”.  On the year of my graduation from college, I made the grave mistake of gaining some of the weight I had back.  The comments again found new fire “Kate, ang taba taba mo na!” and “Ano ang nangyari sa iyo?”.  After several years of non-contact with these dangerously tongued family members, I actually started to gain some confidence. I’ve begun to form my own conclusion as my “ideal” weight.  I’ve accepted the fact that I can never spend more than 10 minutes making my face look perfect.  And I’ve made my peace with the hair-dryer, where we both agree to part on friendly terms.  I’ve also learned to see myself as not ugly – not beautiful- but not ugly. I believe that this little piece of maturity lent me enough courage to be what I really want to be – wear what I really want to wear and look the way I really want to look.  I may make fashion disasters every now and then, but I pride myself in being fairly unique.  My trip to Bagio reopened the wounds however.  There I was, dressed up in an expensive gown, made up by an expensive artist, all ready to receive the compliments I had foolishly subconsciously expected to receive only to get another insult.  “You look older than your mom!”.  This at a time when I almost felt beautiful.  Not that my mother isn’t youthful, but, couldn’t they find anything else to say?  Even when I complimented them on their gowns (and thus, in a polite society, they’re expected to compliment you back right?) they mentioned nothing.  While these emotional blows were not intended (I truly believe they are not malicious) and partially cushioned by Alex’s unwavering love and adoration, I can’t help but cry.  Maybe I am wrong.  Maybe I am what they say I am.  And maybe I can never be as great as any of my other cousins.  And maybe I should just get used to that.  Or maybe I should fight back and tell all of them to go to somewhere hot and way south.  Only time will tell whether fury or pain will win out.

      Perhaps more and more now, I've become what I had always hoped I wouldn't be: a loud-mouthed-too-many-opinions for my own good type of individual. It's something that truly bothers me because I used to hate people like, well, the me I perceive now. And now that I don't abhor them as much, it scares me crazy.  Since isn't that more proof that I am one of them?  There used to be a time (I say this cautiously since, the rest of the hearing universe may have other opinions) when I was far more diplomatic and a great deal more sensitive to how people will perceive what I say. However, that was more because of my fear of saying something wrong - even if it was true - after all, honesty isn't always right. Now that I've become more confident of myself, and of the affections and friendships of the people around me, I find that it is becoming more and more difficult to watch what I say and how I say it. I end up hurting people or giving them an impression that I value no other opinion than my own. Which, contrary to popular belief, isn't really true. I merely enjoy having passionate arguments (as opposed to heated ones) and have just really lost the gift of guile and diplomacy - gifts I thought I once had.  Of course, there will always be the school of thought that states honesty is better than anything. But I can't for the life of me believe in that whole-heartedly, sad, since I've become so honest - to the point of rudeness. It would have been so easy to believe in what I am, but I just don't.  So now I must revert back to a semblance of my old self. Maybe this time I would even do it for the right reasons, as opposed to doing it for fear, who knows? I've already begun, but of course, it ain't easy to hold one's tongue. I am trying though, and every journey begins with a single step right? Even if it is a baby one.
