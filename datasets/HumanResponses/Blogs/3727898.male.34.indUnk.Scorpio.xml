      Okay, I have met two guys who are incredible.  I present both of them as one person, because their actions are very similar.  And I just need to write down what I am feeling.  Both of these men are great acquaintances.  They seem to be very dynamic people that are not afraid to live life.  And it is very intoxicating.  I asked a question that I knew I was not ready for, but I was tired of pretending I was gonna get more than I was being offered.    These guys go out.  They have a nice click of people they hang out with.  People they vacation with or invite to restaurants or to go bowling with their other friends.  I found that I was treated well by these men, but I was never invited anyone.  I have known both men for over a year, and told for quite a bit that my friendship was important to them.  I often found myself chatting deeply with them right before I watch them invite someone else out for lunch, or having conversations about what they and several other acquaintances did together.  So, I asked if I would ever be one of those friends.  The answer was no.  An acceptable answer.    I had a hard time understanding and dealing with the fact that these individuals will still chat with me and tell me how "important" I was, but still keep me sitting on the sidelines for everything.  I thought maybe it was because I dont "party", but that is just an assumption and I will never really know what it is that keeps me from being that close to them.  So, is this what pisses me off most?  No.  It does ache, but no.  What pisses me off most is that the most amiable traits of these two individuals is that they keep the secrets of their friends.  Friends being the optional word.  They can have friends visit this area or having some sort of event, and I will never hear about it.  For some reason information I give them in confidence becomes public.  Everyone can know about my sexual history if they ask.  They will have friends calling me that I have never met, but dont dare ask for the name of one of their friends.  Or I can be in a group and someone will start volunteering my family status, or proclaiming me a "surrogate father" or explaining to people that I am knew to the family (because it is so obvious, right?).    I just feel that there is a lot to love about these people if I was on the friend level.  I would be so protected and I would get to be apart of the wondrous machine they appear to be.  I see that there is a lot to lose if they were removed from my life, but I feel the only way to control the situation is to dump them before they dump me.  I am losing out on a lot of what they could offer even someone they dont intend to be close to... but is it worth always trying to explain myself or trying to steal some of that joy for myself in the meantime.    I am still trying to answer that question, but I know I have taken steps to push them both away.  I hope they dont take the bait and disappear, but I am not certain how to deal with them if they do not...

      Went to my first Gay Pride Parade.  Learned a lot about Stonewall and my  heritage .  I was very impressed.  I think this was the first time I looked at the parade and really saw "us".  Not those people.  Not we, the misguided freaks and damned creatures.  Not cries for attention or pleadings for acceptance.  I saw people.  Standing up, not standing out.  This was different for me, and still a bit difficult.  I saw many faces that matched mine own, and yet, I still felt them all distant.  I saw people who would make great superficial friends, just as many straights do.  I saw that we are no different from everyone else.  If anyone decided to acknowledge me or even accept my attempts to be cordial, they were looking for that big, defining W.I.I.F.M. moment.    What's In It For Me?    I know that I went down to Midtown without feeling threatened.  I also left my family to go participate in this solitary display of pride, without feeling guilt.  It was awesome even if it was not exactly rewarding.  I do plan on seeing more of   The Life  , but the solitary slant has got to go.    Anyone know of a good place for Newly Outs to meet and discuss the transition phase?  Is there anyone in the Atlanta area willing to be that buddy?  Two obvious traits to be aware of:  I am chubby.  I am annoying.  Both of those traits were probably fairly obvious when you sat down to read this... Ooooppps... Ixnay on the egativity-nay.    Finding that it is easy to make friends, but difficult to make a connection.  I can find someone to eat lunch with, but not to talk and communicate deeply with.  I seem to be exchanging the box of the straight world for the box that the queer world favors.    The parade was a lot like this.  A grand display; a beautiful gesture; a street scene to be viewed but not interfered with.  Know your role, keep in step and don't push... lol.  The friendships that I have made in this world have been great.  Providing that you dont ask for anything, and accept whatever you are given... simple rules to live by, so I am sure I will be defeated and learn these rules in my attempt to shatter them.  Oh well, I need to go to bed now.  Thanx for caring and reading this.

        Who are you?   I guess this is the point where I should give you an idea of who I am, and hopefully, some incentive to stay.   I am a confused individual.  This seems as good of a starting point as any.    I am not knocking myself or anything, that is merely a statement. I do not consider myself to be confused based solely on my sexuality. I am confused about my social status, ethnic status, financial status and ideologies. I know what I am and who I am, but coming to terms with EVERYTHING is a difficult chore for me. I obsess silently and often. I do not make New Year's resolutions since I daily re-evaluate myself. Makes for a nice recursive little loop to get stuck inside of.     Why are you writing?   I have often found that by expressing myself on paper I get to the heart of what it is I am really thinking and feeling. Writing is a deeply personal, yet cathartic release. I am an individual that never sees himself as stressing out. This is partly due to my ability to diffuse situations before they exist. Not always the best choice, as I chose to cut issues off long before anyone ever notices that an issue exists. I also tend to halt any opportunities for happiness if I can anticipate insurmountable obstacles. I call myself "writing page three, planning page 7".   I will write in an informal style, and if the mood hits me, a very CANDID and frank style. I have had about 7 handwritten journals which have helped to quiet my mine... I have lost three of them. Perhaps I wont lose or forget about this electronic one.   I am not shy, but I am generally cautious. I have three buzzwords you will hear a lot in my writings. Each one of those buzzwords is built on the one that preceded it, so it is best I explain those now:       Impressions    I am aware of the impressions certain statements, actions or even moments of silence, may give. I believe it is called NON-Verbal Communication. I do not ever intend to falsify or direct how I am perceived, but be advised that I am conscious of it.   I run in three modes:   Gung-ho, I will just say what I feel and let the chips land where they may;   Cautious, where I realized in order to get my point across, or learn something from you, that I have to keep the lines of communication open and be conscious of how my actions, words or pauses may influence our ability to keep dialoging. ; Withdrawn, where I realize I dont want to fight, so I will honestly and actively listen, and may be moved by your arguments; I just chose to no longer contribute or educate.       Shells   We all have barriers concerning: how much we tell of ourselves; how close we allow someone to get to us; and in what avenues we allow ourselves to be revealed. I do not like shells, but they are a necessity in todays world. Provided one knows when to apply them.   I prefer being told to "stop" as opposed to being lied to. I may not respond favorably to no, but I highly respect it and treat the wielder of the no as I would like to be treated.     I am not talking about sex here.     I attempt to write so that I may expose myself and those walls. I do not mind letting people break through them. If I encounter your shell along the way, I will attempt to push back through yours. If I find your walls to firmly affixed, I usually place mine back up. I get the vibe that I am gonna be used and that you are making sure I don't have a way to GIVE as good as I RECEIVE.     Essence    Sometimes we say things that are not the heart of what we actually mean. Sometimes we avoid questions to answers we are not yet ready for, or jump into situations just to keep from losing the moment. Know what you are about and be true to yourself. Essence refers to your very nature. If it is not in your nature to be sexual, say so. If what you are asking is if I will fall in love with you, ask me if you are prepared to deal with whatever response I give you... if you are tired of living in a world where others exists as 2 dimensional characters. This is where the majority of my flaws can be found. I lie. Not intentionally, but I do it to keep people from calling me on my wavering/changing thoughts. Mainly only to myself. If I can re-phrase a certain comment to address why I am doing "X" without contradicting my ability to run in the opposite direction later, I will position the actual truth on a sliding scale with no commitment to a stance. Don't try to figure it out, you will be stuck in another loop.      ...Finally, the end    Well, I guess in a nutshell you know all you need to know about me. I am no superman. It is virtually impossible to scare me or freak me out. I will discuss anything you want to talk about, but I do reserve the right to avoid certain topics. I do not mind attention, but I do not need it throwing "light" on people I may be writing about.   All of this was written from my heart.  Direct and uncensored, so take it for what it is worth for TODAY.    So, if you are feeling so inclined, give me a holla... I hope to be posting my first entry today. I do not expect many people will be able to find this journal anyway, lol...
