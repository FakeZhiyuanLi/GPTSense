      I had LASIK just over three weeks ago. So far, the results are  excellent  -- 20/15 in both eyes! I understand it's unrealistic to expect post-surgical vision that's comparable to your best  corrected  vision before surgery, but that what I've got! Stars are particularly noticeable -- tiny one-dimensional points of light rather than the smallish smeary globs I had with my last glasses. And reading signs across a room -- amazing! I still have some nighttime fuzz around bright lights but nothing really that distracting, and it'll probably diminish as my corneas heal. Anyway it's no worse than nighttime vision with my contacts. I'm sure my outcome was helped by my being a good LASIK candidate: pupils not overly large, presbyopia not objectionable yet (not looking forward to that!), mild myopia (between -4 and -5 in both eyes), compatible corneal anatomy (not too thin). Also my surgeon went to great lengths to get a good prescription beforehand with pupils both normal and dilated, so the laser knew exactly what to do -- garbage in garbage out, just like computer programming. And as far as the procedure itself is concerned, after years of contact-wearing I'm not too squeamish about things getting close to my eyes.  So would I recommend it? I'd do it again for sure, but not everyone is willing to take chances with their eyes. As I read somewhere, the risks exist, and if you're a borderline candidate eye surgery isn't the way to find out if you're lucky. Expectations are important: Don't expect to never wear glasses again (I got some WalMart reading glasses to see close-up while shaving), expect some discomfort during the procedure and afterward (moderately dry eyes are my biggest problem, but it should get better), be aware of the risks (the web has lots of sites where people with bad outcomes describe their ordeals, but lots of good stuff, too). I know I'm satisfied so far!

      I've gotten out of the pattern of journalling in the last few months, so maybe a blog will motivate me. This'll be a placeholder post for the moment since I'm at work and I really need to do the important stuff for which I get paid...

      A LASIK update: Six weeks since the surgery, and everything's still great. My eyes are dry less often, the acuity is still there (20/15), closeup vision has improved (or I'm getting used to being a normal 40-year-old with the beginnings of presbyopia). I think the fuzziness around lights at night has gotten slightly better, and remember that it wasn't that bad to start with. I'm still quite happy with the results, and I'm starting to take the ability to see without correction for granted.  So, how about all this gay marriage stuff? Quite something, huh? In an online news article Senate Majority Leader Frist is quoted as saying, "Same sex marriage is likely to spread through all 50 states in the coming years. It is becoming increasingly clear that Congress must act." He's advocating an amendment to the U.S. constitution defining marriage as being between one man and one woman. But I get excited by his feeling that there's a trend to perform gay marriages. Portland, Oregon just started today. I once saw someone liken it to the Israelis occupying the West Bank -- controversial, ostensibly illegal, but the more people are there, the harder it is to get them back out. Once there are thousands of gay couples -- tens of thousands -- hundreds? -- considering themselves legally married, the prospect of trying to invalidate all of them becomes daunting. Scary for opponents to same-sex marriage, and certainly a thought lending urgency to their agenda. My views? C'mon -- an amendment to the constitution? To define marriage? Silly. I'm all for the definition of civil marriage to include any two people of an appropriate age. I don't see any downside whatsoever. Undermine the institution of family? I don't think so.
