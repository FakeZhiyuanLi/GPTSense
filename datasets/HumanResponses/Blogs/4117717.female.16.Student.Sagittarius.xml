      Here are my own lyrics to that song as I just made them up...well to the chorus...cause yeahh....  I am sleepy My hair is frizzy And a little bit curly And I would like to go to sleep But it's a tad too early see? Please put your arms around me And maybe I will have sweet dreams I swear I need that more now Then I ever have before   Hah so yeah that sucks. What can I say? I start to make up lyrics in my head to songs when I am this sleepy.....It's true though...especially about the hair!...Jeez, I am having a bad hair day today.  I've been in such a Dashboard Confessional Emo mood latley. I've been listening to "Hands Down" NON-STOP. It's such a nice song though. I'd like that to happen to me :)...But as my previous post replys that I really shouldn't be wishful anymore cause it just ends up hurting in the end. And that is such a typical teenage girl thing to say. Aww it's so romantic I want that to happen to me. No, Ok, I just want the good feelings to happen to me, not the shitty romantic stuff, cause that stuff makes me laugh. I mean...can you imagine the conversations after the big romantic move? God, they must be awkward. "So uh...that was a nice loud song you sang to me with the flowers asking to marry me all lined up and all."..."Um..yeah thanks. It took me awhile to find a good florist."...."Oh really, what florist did you get? I hope you got the cheap one, the other one is a rip off."..."Why, yes actually I did get the cheap one, got quite a bargian on it!"..."Oh that's nice. We always want to save our money."  Yes that conversation is just filled with passion and love for each other. Or like a week later the bill comes for like the airplane in the sky saying "I love you"..."DAMNIT! I can't afford this!"...."But honey, our love will pay for it. Our love can salvage anything.." .."CRAM IT! where the hell am I supposed to get 500 bucks??"....  So yes...GOOD FEELINGS FOR ME. No extra other stuff. But I am not really going to be picky. cause...Has either happened to me?.....Yeah but I am not complaning cause single life is quite the life for me at the moment. ........................Whether you belive that is sarcasim or not you can decide :)  Whatever, I guess I would have to LIKE someone for all of this now wouldn't I?....And no comments from that part of the mind, thank you very much.  Bleh, whatever I am only 16. I'm not expecting to find my true love or any love at all at this age. Cause....I am 16. And all boys want is sex at this age. And I am definitly not going to comment on that. But then again, since no one has..........then no one would want to.........me. HAH. I love my blanks.  Ok I swear to god, I just need to end this now. Just digging myself a grave at this point.  ..........................................................................  So it turns out most people's advisories are different. This pisses me off. Advisory last year at one point was the only GOOD PART OF MY DAY. And I still have yet to have any classes with anyone I know. ...Or stand. Yup, this year sucks already. And I am going to get sucky lunches cause every singal year I do. I have yet to have a good lunch. And if I don't have Mrs. MacGuire again for advisory I'll flip, cause I liked having gym teachers for advisory! I got off easier in gym class!!!!!! ....Damnit.damnit.damnit.

      I just finished the Virgin Suicides. Interesting movie. About teenage suicide obviously. The end I thought was really disturbing in the wake of all these suicides that happened in one family, the neighbors through a party and the theme was "infixiuation". Some older man, maybe 40's, at the party, stood before a pool and said "Goodbye life" and jumps in the water. Everyone stares at him, and two people help him out. Everyone starts laughing when he says "No you don't understand, I'm a teenager and I have problems."  I was thinking...maybe it does look that stupid to older people. I mean, here we are, not having to pay bills, or think about real jobs, or real money aspects, not living on our own, not having to really see what life is yet. And yet, we want to kill ourselves. I think it's just something in the person's mind...but you can't really seem to describe without listing all the normal aspects of depression. But to you it seems so much more. Well, that's how it was with me at least. When I had to start taking my meds, I thought that I was just this one isolated case and not many people experience. But it's the complete opposite. I read in an article once that 10 million teens take Prozac. That didn't make me feel better like "Well at least I am not a freak."...It made me feel even more alone. Like...so I am not that important really. Big deal, if you feel like shit and that your mind almost feels like one big dark space, a lot of people feel that way too, what makes you so special?....When other people can understand what your going through, it doesn't help. It just makes you feel more worthless  cause your just falling into that now sterotype and every time I think about it that way it feels like I am just falling more and more into it. The more I've fallen, the harder it is to get out.  I don't know...I mean....what is making us all so miserable? To blame it on just your mind doesn't work. It seems people need concrete proof on why you hate your life. Big deal, you don't have friends. You really do but you just want to say that so you get more attention in the end from your real friends. Big deal, you hate your parents. Yes, because they ask you to take out the trash once a week and that is just too tough.  I hate falling into a sterotype. Yes I know I do have friends. I have good friends actually. Yes, I live in a nice house, with financial support, I'm in good health, everyone I love is in good health, I don't live in a third world country. But I still hurt myself and cry all the time. Why is that? What honestly makes me unhappy and think bad thoughts? But does it really matter since 10 million other people do the exact same thing?  I don't know what the point is I am trying to make. The idea that depression is an actual health problem is still strange for me. How can being sad be a phsyical problem with your mind? I mean, saddness is an emotion. Everyone feels emotions. So why do certain emotions stay with certain people at longer times? Why can certain people brush off events that hurt them and move on easier then others? Is it because they are a better person or that they are trying to avoid the truth about themselves by ignoring bad situations?  Aren't we supposed to control emotions? Is that why, someone once told me to just get over it and be god damned happy? Why can't I do that? Why can't those 10 million other people that are just taking Prozac let alone the number of people who are "depressed" do that? Is depression even a real problem? Or is it something that was just put into our minds subconsisly and every couple of people feel the need to act out those symptoms?  But that leads to the question, what is real and what is not real, and that is just something no one can really answer.

      So today I didn't get to sleep as much...aww I know...I'm gonna catch up on that tomorrow. I got out of bed for the last time at 1, then MOWED THE LAWN! Talk about exciting. And I got sad while mowing the lawn cause they were talking about the Warped Tour on the radio and dude...it sounds even better now. Meh, oh well.  Um after that I watched the ever so exciting Maury. The fat babies episodes are the best. Hah, they are just so fat! I feel terrible for them, cause their parents are just stuffing their faces. There was this one baby just walking around and would sit with the audience and took Maury's mic and just scream into it and run in front of the camera. He was quite the entertainment. And of course like everyone else I decided to make cookies while watching the fat babies! Don't worry, they were oatmeal. I like oatmeal cookies. Infact, I belive I should go have one.....  Um after that I didn't do anything. Took a nap. Checked the no new emails. And now I get to go and mow the back lawn, cause I am doing that and avoiding practicing driving tonight. I've been driving with my parents for at least an hour every singal night and I'm quite tired. I just need this one day break. ..the break to mow the lawn. Sigh.   Um......that is all, I suppose...

      I would like to say that today was a very remarkable day because......   SEAN SWETZ CALLED ME ON THE TELEPHONE!     This is a huge step and I appalaud you, Sean!  And what's even more remarkable is that he just called me to say MAYBE we could do something on Sunday.....  That was very nice of you, Sean. I enjoy hearing your voice...no matter how creepy that sounds...haha.....Ok I enjoy hearing your voice in a non-stalker-creepy way. Good? Ok I think that should be good...Even though my voice is a different story considering I sound like a MAN on the phone. That brings back bad memories of Evan Mosley saying I had the lowest voice on the bus. Stupid Evan Mosley...Even though that was before the whole squeakiness of boys changed their voices.  Anyways, that was completley off the topic. So yes, Sean, I'm very proud of you! Your getting over your phone phobia...Congrats, that means you can call me more!...Hah which me saying that will now make you not call me......  Meh, I'm just gonna stop while I'm some what ahead.  Wait, am I even ahead?  Ok I'm just gonna stop. I've already said way too much today....

      I was just thinking...that would be even more nastier then just taking the medicine plain. I mean, here I am taking nasty cough syrup and afterwards I have to have a spoon full of just sugar right afterwards....I think that would make me gag. Ew, gross, its realy getting to me now. But do you know what? You know that scene in Mary Poppins when she is singing that song and she puts her fingers out and the little bird (only later did I realize it was MECHANICAL) hops onto her finger and starts like..singing..with her?....Yeah ever since I was little I've thought if I hold my fingers out just like Mary Poppins a bird will come onto my finger and start singing and not like peck my eyes out. When I was little I used to go running around places holding my fingers out like that near the birds, but they'd always fly away : (...My Mary Poppins dream has yet to come true. Actually I haven't tried it in awhile, so maybe a bird will come now. ...Hmmm.......I mean, Mary Poppins WAS older, but I am older then I was the first time I tried it. Alright, I'll try it tomorrow. ...If it's not raining....and if there are birds...and if they aren't ugly birds, cause who wants an ugly bird on your finger singing?  Ok sorry I went off on a rant. Specifically a Mary Poppins rant. Which I am quite sure NONE of you can say that you went off on such a rant.  Um, anyways...I realized that when I get really bitterly jealously mad at something I get really hyper. And go off on such tangents like the Mary Poppins one. Even though I belive that one was just waiting inside me to come out. Cause it is true about the bird story. I still want that to happen and would totally freak out and scare the bird to death if that ever happened. Man, I hope someone is around me when that happens, cause I want to get a picture and it framed and all...Even though the flash from the camera may upset the bird. Ok, so no flash cameras it is. And it has to be during the day anyways....Cause I mean, birds dont sing at night. Maybe I should resemble Mary Poppins? Maybe all birds have seen the movie Mary Poppins and will only sing to someone like her?...Ok so get Julie Andrews on the phone, tell her to send me a wig and costume and I'm all set.  Kate Schnebly will be transformed intoooo....MARY POPPINS. Dude, I hope she sends me that bag too that had that really tall stuff in it. Like..a lamp. Who doesn't want a lamp coming out of their bag???? That'd be great. ...I think she also had like a yard stick. I mean, that's just practical...you always need a yard stick in your bag to measure little children. What if a little kid comes up to you and says "how tall am I?" and you aren't prepareded???? My god, that child would be scarred for life.  OH AND THE UMBRELLA! Who needs a car when you have that umbrella? Sure it may be a little....weird...and you might get hit by a plane or something but I mean...its a pretty handy umbrella. And you can go as fast as you want to. No umbrella cops to stop you!  Ok. I am ending the Mary Poppins rant....rightt.........OH MY GOD! And that whole...Chalk world or something...you know they go into the chalk sidewalk? With that guy who had the whole band attached to him? And they go on cartoon horses? And the horses have such human like features with the emoitions on their faces and all?....Actually I think that would freak me out. A horse having more expressions then me would just be ...too much. Ok I think in general if a horse had really noticable eyebrows it would freak me out. And they went up and down a lot...Ok I am just starting a nightmare for me.  ....I just had a sudden urge to watch Pochonathous. Hah, I totally did not spell that right. ...with that little...singing ....raccoon or something. And that pissed off humming bird. And that fat dog who had a little...hat on or something.  OK ENOUGH DISNEY!  I'm ending this now.

      So my dog is upstairs. Now, this is weird cause my dog never comes upstairs unless he wants something from one of us. And I asked him what he wanted and he just layed down on the top of the stairs. It's odd. I know he doesn't want to go outside cause he was just out and he can't have any more food till dinner. ...So...I don't know. I call his name and he looks up at me and then he just puts his head right back down. Hm.  Anyways, todays been good. I went to bed last night at 12:30. I woke up at 11:30 but not to my liking. My dad was calling me at work, so my brother had to wake me up and give me the phone. I guess my dad just couldn't wait till he got home to tell me he got me a day for my drivers test. Personally, when I am sleepy and I just woke up rudley, I don't care. And then he goes on to tell me what he wants me to do tomorrow (um ok?) and goes on and on about now what we need to practice with driving. That's nice. I don't care right now. Try back later.  So after my dad FINALLY stops talking, like 10 minutes later, I go back to bed. But now my whole concentration on sleeping is skewed so I just lay in my bed till 12:15. I get up then, and go on the computer to check the exciting email. Yeah nothing that exciting. Austin emailed me, which was nice, and someone from the youth group. Yup. Um, so at 12:30 I decided I'd go back to sleep then I woke up again at 2. I didn't want to wake up but realized that a lifetime movie was starting. It sucked though. Blind woman who can play instruments learns how to see with rich man's help but declines his offer to tour the world to go after her neighbor in romanitc pursuit. Which of course works and everyone is all happy prappy at the end except for the rich guy who got completley screwed.  And I almost broke my new rule. The one I wrote about in a previous thing of these. But I managed. And I'm proud of myself..kinda.  And I honestly don't think this entry entertained anyone at all cause it was pretty boring.  Much apologies.

      Um. Yup so I saw Farenheit 9/11 with Nicole. Freaking amazing. Like, I am sure some things are not true, taking out of context, and all of that, but the images of war.....God. Just makes me hate war even more. And the way it made me think afterwards like how mainly poor people go into the army because they can't afford to go to college and they don't have a lot of other choices, I guess....and how no one in the governments families ever go.... I dont know. It just was a really thought provoking movie. I would recommend it highly. ...Jesus, and the idea the government can get away with some things....and maniuplate people's minds....just...frightening. But like I said, I am not going to put all of this into the FACT area of my mind, it just made me think. Yikes...the war images are just staying with me. Like, innocent people were killed in the bombs that we sent over to Iraq. How does that make us any better then the terroists? Both sides just ended up killing lots of innocent people. That's what just makes me really mad. People who weren't involved in the government or the war or anything get killed. They just get killed cause that's where they happened to be at that time. It really made me think about 9/11 all over again and how truly horrible that was. I knew it then, but it's just been reinserted into my mind. ...Too much war and hate. I know we all are never going to get along, but why drag innocent people into it? Let Bush handle his own problems with the men themselves. All these people are just...such wussys to make someone else fight their wars.  That's just my opinon and if you don't agree then that is ok with me. We all have different opinons and I accept that, anyone can think differently.  Oh and this is completley off the topic but when I got home, I was laying on my bed writing out notes to go with the pictures I am sending to friends in Colorado and it hit me. It really hit me that I am not in Colorado anymore. Like, I knew that obviosuly I was in Rhode Island, and normally it hits me the second I leave that I am not going to see these people again for a long time. But this year it was different, and it just now hit me. Especially since I won't be visiting them next summer, cause of my parents. I really miss them. 2 weeks with my friends..the people I care about most in this world...out of a whole year.....Its just not fair. Especially since we are all getting older. We're all branching out into our own ideas and our own lives. Soon we will be going to college...then what happens?..... 2 weeks is just...not a very long time in the long run.  God, I miss them terribly.

      I'm tired already. And I slept really well last night. I want to go take a nap but I guess that is not possible. Um, so um...Oh yeah today I get to ...CLEAN OUT MY CLOSET!...fasinating, eh? It will take me forever though cause...I hate my closet. And it's small. With stuff bursting out of it. Then around 5, I am going to Panera's and meet up with Nicole...I haven't seen her all summer, so that should be good. Then we may go see a movie but we don't know what or which or when, we are just going to show up at the movie place and see what's playing at the time we get there. Sounds like a solid plan, huh?

      Ok so yeah I was in a depressing mood this morning. Basically depressed all day, so I slept most of the day...At one point I was going to go back to sleep but decided to check online and lo and behold Austin was on. Some other people were too...with away messages...or just...nothing and I didn't want to talk to them.....But you know, Austin has problems with communicating on the internet, so I just decided to call him. Let me tell you, Austin has officaly made my day with that 30 minute conversation. He's just hilerious. I don't know what I would do without him. And we didn't talk about anything negative or what not, just random stuff so all was well. And I rarley talk to Austin on the phone so it's always interesting.... So anyways, we just talked about how if he ever comes to visit me the first thing that we are going to do is he is going to make me watch the last Lord of the Rings movie. Like, the second he gets here. No hello's. No hugs. Just the movie. Since I haven't seen it, and he's quite disgraced by that...And then we came to the conclusion we were both going to be single for life after sharing the updated stories of "crushes". Hah and how we are going to be very very bitter and be at like Jessa's house in the future with all her kids running around and how we will throw things at her kids. But it was funny, cause I told him if he ever did get a girlfriend, me, Jessa and Jessica will have to interview her before anything happens. Like sit her down in a room. With Jessa and Jessica sitting down on chairs in front of her and then a chair next to them with a phone on it. Which would be me :) And how if she sits down on the chair with the phone on it she is automatically elimanted!!!!! Hah, she must respect the phone. Wouldn't that be a good idea, Jessica? I told him he had to find one soon just so we could do that. Hah and then it was horrible cause I was talking about how it would just be too weird for us to witness Austin having a girlfriend, cause we've known him too long, and I said "Yeah it'd be kinda freaky to go to the movies with you and the girlfriend and see you like making out with her..." AND THAT MOMENT MY MOM WALKED IN. Oy vey. Talk about how people need to learn how to knock in this house.  But anyways on the topic of that...shtuff...afterwards while I was straigtening my hair, listening to Yellowcard, I decided I will never ever again tell a boy I like him. Like, being the first one to say that and all. And how I will never ever again make a move on a boy first either. So Self-Control 101 here I come (hah Katie...). Cause none of those ...ever....ever work out. I think I did that with like the last three crushes I've had, and yeah they all just ended with me being all sad and rejected like. The first crush I had doing that, it was just random and weird and blew up in my face like right away. The second one, I did it a little more slowly, and I thought it was working out until...it blew up in my face. Then the third one, I thought it may work out and was really hoping it would since that was the most I ever liked someone, but that also blew up in my face. So...NO MORE! No more self inflicated emotional pain. So for now on...I am just gonna sit back...relax...and watch absluotly no boys notice me. As usual, but at least I won't be making a fool out of myself during the process.  So I will be single for life.  .....Great.  .....just great.  Sigh...ok I admit it, I would really like a boyfriend...cause just the idea that someone actually likes me in that way...would be awseome....since no one has... :/... but...it never works out that way and I don't want to try to force anything on anyone. Cause that would be rude. I'm already a horrible person, but I don't think I need to become any worse of a person.  But whatever, everything is ok right now in that area, cause at the moment I'm alright without a boyfriend. Well ok so I've always been alright without a boyfriend...obviously...but right now it doesn't really bug me....it just bugs the HELL out of me that I am a 16 year old girl whose never been........ GAH!  Ok end of topic.  How was your day?

      I feel so dead right now. Everything is so heavy it's hard to move. Latley I have this notebook near my bed where I just write down anything that comes to me. Last night I wrote down who I was completley. I hate myself, more now then I ever have before. I don't know if I have enough strength to change. I'm so sorry to everyone I know. I really am a horrible person, very selfish. But I will find the strength to change, I just need something to believe in. I keep thinking that might make everything a little better.

      So...I just woke up and had the most BEST dream in the freakin universe. Well ok I've had better, but this one.....yeah this one was nice. And I havent had nice dreams in a freakishly long time so....sigghh...it was good. It was pretty confusing. It kept going back and forth between different places, but some moments......good moments. Hah, yup. No kissing, making out, or having sex...I dont have THOSE kind of dreams, this was just a....awseome dream. Which I still don't really feel like explaining......but Jessica/Katie I'll tell you about it later if you would like to hear about my fantabulous dream. Since you know...you two are the only ones who read this. SIGHHh....aw man, twas a good dream. I wish it would come true....well....some parts. The parts that made sense. So you know, I was all happy prappy waking up and pretty bouncy like "yay! even if it that never happens in real life, it totally felt real and I am quite content right now."...Yeah ok so contentness goes to bitterness cause I go on the computer and I read other random people's blogs...andddd........GAR. It makes the dream even farther away from reality. Which sucks. I think I'm just going to block all blogs except for Jessica's. ...Cause Jessica's is awseome. And I am going to go back to sleep now, cause the bounciness has worn off into tiredness.....

      So I just got back a couple of minutes ago from the mall/concert. Sean, Scott (Sean's brother) and I (take that good grammer!) went. We first went to the Providence Place Mall and for my Colorado friends...(who would be..reading this....) It's this giganitc huge mall. Bigger then South Glen. That's why it's in Provdience I suppose. It has like...what? 3 levels? Something like that. And they have this huge confusing indoor parking. Which you have to pay for which I always find funny. I don't know why though. Anyways we went there first where I got DAIRY QUEEN!!! Cause yes, this is the only place in Rhode Island that I know of that has Dairy Queen...And Orange Julius. You should have seen how happy I was after the Dairy Queen. At first I couldn't eat the blizzard I just stared at it in awe. ...Hah yes cause I am a loser like that.  So we walked around a bit then walked over to the place where the concert was right across the street. There, this girl who rides my bus like..jumped on me. I saw her in the mall and said hi but she didn't see me, but I guess she saw me then! Her and Dean where there. Now Dean hasn't really ever talked to me unless Alison is there, which obviously she never now cause she moved, which is sad cause Dean is a nice kid. Well...that I know of. So I talked to them a bit, and Deidre (bus girl) I think scared Sean and Scott. She's very outgoing. I like her cause once she gave me a cigeratte when I really needed one. DONT WORRY THAT WAS MY LAST CIGERATTE. Considering I've only had like what? 9 in all? so yes nothing to worry about there.  After they left we hung around a bit more, the first band was horrible so we eventually just went back to the mall and looked around some more. It's a nice mall. They didn't though have the Freaks and Geeks DVD set that I wanted that Sean saw once in a store there. Tis sad. And we discussed about how Hot Topic is way to scary to go into and I shared my brave story about going in there with everyone when I was in Colorado. Oh, we also walked by this one store...umm...you know with all the funky stuff? Like weird chairs? and really pointless gadgets? Yeah so there is a pillow like near the window and Scott goes "Kate feel this pillow."...So I do...so does Sean. Scott says "Doesnt that feel like a boob?"...and I say "Well mine don't feel like that.".... DAMNIT why the hell did I say that???? The second it came out of my mouth, I was like "GOD."...That's just not a thing to share. They both kind of looked at me weird and we none the less moved on pretty quickly. But I must say that pillow definitly did not feel like a boob. Cause if all girls had ones like that then they'd be insanley bouncy and annoying. And that's all I am going to discuss on breasts at the moment...Ok for awhile, cause this is just not a topic I really feel the need to discuss. ANYWAYS, oh yes and Sean also saw Desiree and her friends in the mall. I kind of feel bad now cause I didn't really say anything to them, but I didn't really know what to say. Like I would have said hi, but I wasn't positive they knew who I was. I was pretty sure they might have, but I didn't want to take chances. So I smiled. What can I say, I was kind of nervous. Umm...then we went back out to the concert, listened to the second band...whose name I can now not remember. They were ok. We missed the one song we knew by them. Then hung around some more...I saw Deidre again...she smacked me on my ass. And it hurt!!!! Like afterwards it stung. ...And I dont know why she did that. And I dont really want to know....Um...anywaysss.... Finally the Lost Prophets came on. They had some sound difficulties at first but they managed to sing some good songs. All of Sean's favorites so that was good. They were the best obviously out of all them. We saw Desiree and her friends again, and they hung out for a little bit, and once again me being petrifiably nervous did not say a word and smiled..... :) Hah..Um, oh yeah there were a bunch of people from school there. That was weird. So Lost Prophets were good...very good indeed...we went back in the mall after they finished...Sean and Scott got clothes. I got an Orange Julius. Then it took us about an hour to get out of the parking lot.......... And now I am home.  And Katie is going to Canada. :( OOO! And Colorado starts school tomorrow...hehe...umm...Good luck with that! Remember to tell me all the details on the first day....

      Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again I don't want to be the one The battles always choose cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm Breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before

      I am sleepy. Are you sleepy?...I am sleepy. I believe I will take a nap after this. I'm watching a really bad movie on FX. About um some killer truck driver out to get kids or something. Yeah I don't know. Wow, I really am tired. I did a lot today too. Well for me. And for it being the summer. I'm not really in any better of a mood. Infact...a little worse. Only one crying session today though. I haven't been able to keep down food however. Infact...just writing that out is kind of not making me feel all that well. Um today I got the honor of cleaning the back of the house. Unfortunatley I didn't think it would take that long and I wore some new clothes. Yeah not a good idea. 45 minutes later I was wet, sweaty and muddy. See I had to scrub the back of the house of this weird mold/fungus stuff that was growing...And there are bushes everywhere...with bugs....and dirt....and I had to keep moving this huge ladder around to get up high. There was this one daddy long legs which I swear was following me around no matter how many times I hit it off the wall. I'd turn around and there it was again! Freaky stuff. I hate bugs.  Oh Sean, if you want to you can see if you want to meet Desiree at the concert since you haven't seen her for awhile and what not. And since she'll be there and everything. That'd be fine and you want to see her right? I am sure she wants to see you. And I am sure I'll be ok by Thursday to still go.

      So today was probably the worst day I have had all summer.  So much...pain in general.  While I was crying over the obvious big thing, a lot of little things came up as well, and it just turned into a big breakdown. One long big sob fest. I remembered school will start soon. I don't want to have to deal with that shit again. Cause of school that means phsyical apperance problems. At one point I cried over how I look. How I guess I am ugly inside and out. (And please do not go "Nooo Kate..you are beautiful!" Cause I mean..that's what people are supposed to say, and I have heard it enough in my life...I've never heard that said when I don't say that about myself, only when I do. And I am not fishing for compliments, so we'll just end that.) Cause of the physical stuff I remember that...some things don't change. lol, figures the stuff I do want to change don't and the stuff that I dont want to change do. If that makes sense.  But...I'd really really really like to thank Katie and Jessica. For actually making me laugh out loud today. I didn't think that was possible at some points....so...I love you guys!

      So there I am. Outside of Banana Republic in the Garden City shopping area. I am alone. I look around, see if anyone notices me, I take a deep breath. I walk in. Now, this store is very...not-me. Since you know, I buy most of my clothes at Target and here I am looking in Banana Republic, so it's quite a risk for me. The first thing I think is..."I wonder if they ever considered using monkeys in their advertisments." I slowly glide through with that oh so delicate walk I have and almost knock into a saleslady. "Oh excuse me, I'm sorry..." I say without trying to make eye contact cause who knows what kind of things goes on in here. "No problem, can I help you?" she says. I look at her. She obviously looks better then me. She actually went through the whole hair and makeup process today. She was wearing nice pants, that were clean, unlike my scruffy looking jeans, and a nice white shirt. Yeah I have my overly large sweatshirt and a grey shirt underneath with a spot on it. I knew I did not belong here. "No thanks." I walk away. I walk over to the pants area...and you know...look at the pants. And they are in colors like that I would never even see in my worst nightmares. Like...peach colored pants! What are wrong with these people? Do we really need peach colored pants in this world? I glance around..."Oh these are cute pants!"...Someone is actually holding up the peach colored pants. Two preppy girls. Who also obviosuly spend quite a lot of time in front of the mirror. Yeah I realize maybe the pants aren't for me. So I see a sales area! Of course, I might belong there, I mean, look at me! I need a sale. I walk over and there are two snobby similar looking blondes. Maybe they were sisters. They are discussing something and I walk over, trying to get to the ...large...section of the sale. They stop talking and look at me. With this kind of like "This is not your territory." look. I thought they might have killed me, you know, like "What! They can't let just anyone into this store! Look at you! Look at your hair, all over the place! Your scruffy looking clothes! Your dirty sneakers! Your plain pimply face! You should be killed for just looking at this store!" So I decided the sales area was not for me. I walk over to across the sales area and I notice a shirt. ...Is this possible?....A shirt that caught my eye and not out of utter discust? I go closer and see the shirt is long sleeved...weird fabric...brown...and it has a tank top underneath it. I go "Eh? It could work." So my next journey was into the changing rooms. Now lots of girls were in the changing rooms. I got one of the rooms that was far out of the way, as if to say "Yeah you must be on the outside." I begin to change and I overhear a conversation. The father is on the cell phone and gives it to his daughter. The daughter talks about how she is in Banana Republic and how she will be out in 20 minutes. She then gets all pouty on the phone..."Well...I don't know!! I wanted to go home afterwards....UH! Fine. Fine. I said FINE!....ok bye sweetie I love you too *giggle*." ...Yeah. Um, I proceed though to try to get into the brown shirt. It's very very difficult with the tanktop attached underneath. It takes me about 15 minutes to get all the way through. I look in the mirror.   No. No. No. No. No. No. WHAT WAS I THINKING? I try to get out of it as quickly as possible but just get tangled and take more time. Meanwhile I continue to hear the father and daughter. "Oh I think those pants look good on you, dear!" "Yeah I think I want them." the mother.."I don't know, how much are they?" "Oh it doesn't matter, she's my daughter! I'll pay for them no matter what!"......Where the hell am I? What is this? A messed up Brady Bunch?  I get out quickly and put the shirt back. I then proceed to walk out of the door...very fast.  I see the sunlight.  And I'm finally there. Outside. I can breath without inhaling toxic perfume smells. Whew. I survived Banana Republic.  Yes, so I realized that...I am not one of those girls. I never will be one of those girls. I am not sure if I even want to be one of those girls. To have that much space in my brain to think about peach colored pants might drive me crazy.  That's just me though.

      Does that happen to anyone else? And you can't quite scratch it. Annoying.  Anyways...that thing that happens when I can't really breath very fully is kinda happening again. Well since I got home yesterday. See, I get this..thing or something where it feels like there is a giant lump in my lungs and my heart feels like its beating faster, and it's harder to breath. And my heart kind of feels like it beats right up to my chest...like as if I was one of those cartoons who are in love and their heart is popping out of their chest. I still can breath but..it's just hard. I'm pretty positive it has to do with anxiety cause I only get it when I am stressed. In 8th grade, I literally had it every singal day, 9th for a couple of months, and 10th every once in awhile. I even got it in Colorado when I still lived there, but I always associated it with nerves cause I would get it before a soccer or basketball game. But now I don't know why I have it cause....I am not stressed. I mean...it's summer. And it's really annoying, cause it's not the most comfortable thing in the world. Ok it's not comfortable at all. It feels like you can throw up but your not naseaus. If that makes sense. But I won't talk about throwing up cause Jessica reads this :) So today was basically pretty relaxing. I went to bed last night at 12:30 and woke up at 11 today...lots of sleep to make up for my lack of sleep from the night before. I got up...had poptarts!...attempted to watch Jimmy Neutron but you know...I had already seen that episode. Cause I'm just cool like that, where I have practically seen every Jimmy Neutron episode. Not to also mention The Fairly Oddparents. And...other various shows, which I am not gonna mention at this time. I then hung out with my dog for a bit outside. Went back inside where I spent the rest of the afternoon in my pajamas watching Family Guy seasons 1 and 2. I think I saw about....6 or 7 episodes today. So that kept me preoccupied till about 4. At 4, I decided it was best to finally get dressed, and I did, and I got to mow the front lawn then. Even though I think some neighbor was trying to get my attention during my mowing, but I don't know. First off I couldn't see without my glasses and second I couldn't hear because with the loudness of the lawn mower and my walkman on with the volume full blast. Let's just say it's so noisy I get a ringing in my ears for about an hour afterwards. So yeah who knows. His problem not mine. Unless...it was my problem...(?). Oh well I am going to stop thinking about this. And I'm thinking about writing another Canning episode soon. ...This episode though might have many many many people I know in it. I'll think about it. I should soon since Canning has been on "hiatis" for awhile.... So now here I am. Absloutly no one is online. And that's a first for awhile. Not even people I don't want to talk are online. Which is fine but...still. I feel very alone. ....Ok not really, I think I'm just kinda sleepy. I should go take a nap.

      Yes, that was my winning answer tonight while playing Scene It with the folks. I was quite in the lead if I do say so myself. So today was an excellent day. I had a lot of trouble going to sleep last night, a lot on my mind, and I didn't get to sleep till 2. Wasn't a very good one either, cause I kept waking up, especially around 4. Finally at 6 I woke up once again and this time couldn't get back to sleep. So I layed in bed for a bit, attempted to read my book (another Stephen King...Needful Things ). That didn't work out so I tried to go back to sleep. Yeah that didn't work either. So around 7, I was like "Wait, why I am just waiting around in my room?" So I went downstairs, Cody was very suprised to see me be the first one awake and I gave him his breakfast. Every day worries me though with him now, I remember he used to always get up right away and beg you for the food in the morning, and the sound of his tail against the wall or floor could wake the whole house up. Today I had to remind him to get up. Of course, he's always very happy once he gets his breakfast in and I played with him for a bit until he decided to go lay down. Well that wasn't enough for me, so I went outside to get the newspaper, and Cody came with me and he rolled around in this giant bush that I call his "little house". It really is the cutest thing to see him in there. I go "Where's Cody? Where is he?" and he gets really quiet...and then he pops out all happy. I love my puppy :) So yes, I made myself some pancakes...watched some television. Which by the way, I am really happy I am not a morning person, cause morning tv sucks SOOO much. I was actually frigthened by some things. Like...yoga on the lifetime channel. And STOCKS on E! Weird. So no one woke up till about 8:30, I told my parents my plans and all, I talked to my mom, and then I got dressed and we left the house by 9:30 to go get Sean. Even though...Ehh...I was supposed to be THERE by 9:30. Eh, what can i say? So we get there like 20 minutes later (car trouble and cops) and by the time we get back to my house it's already 10. Sean and I (oo so much correct grammer!) watched a Family Guy episode and a South Park episdoe. And he let me borrow his DVD's on Family Guy. So I know what I am doing tomorrow! Then my brother drove us to the movies. We first saw The Village and let me just say.....THAT MOVIE IS CRAZY! Oh my god. Just crazy. That's all I could say afterwards. That's all I can say now! I'd recommend it highly. We then went across the street and met up with his mom at Ruby Tuesdays for lunch. Yum, chicken fingers. And his mom is very nice and paid for for the lunch. I'm not sure if she likes me though...hmmm...I'll "ponder" on that one later...since you know...the whole condoms incident..Hah. Um, yes then we went across the street again back to the movies and saw Napoleon Dynamite. Wow, was that movie pointless. Pointless but hilerious. So it evened out in the end and I liked it. But oh so pointless. I don't believe there was an actual plot. But, hysterical. After that we had about an hour and we went over to Walgreen where we bought M&M's. Yeah sorry no visits to the condom aisle this time. Then we went to Panera's and had hot chocolate. Which I would also highly recommend. Very yummy hot chocolate. I like hanging out with Sean a lot, I'm not sure if he likes hanging out with me so much especially today cause I was kinda paranoid and during our hot chocolate I kept asking him if he actually did like me as a friend and not just being nice, or feel bad for me, and etc. etc. Cause I am officialy now paranoid about that. Don't worry, I didn't ..."dwell" on that too long, maybe about 2 minutes, then we talked about other random stuff. I just wanted to at least ask to try to maybe clear my paranoia. And yeah his response helped. We walked over to his mom's work and she drove me home. I came home. I layed in my bed. Listening to Maroon 5. Without napping. Strange. Had dinner. Mowed the back lawn. Played Scene it with the folks. And now I am here. Alone.  It's really quiet.  I think I'll go watch some Daria.

      So today was nice. I woke up at 11. Had pancakes at 12. Went back to sleep at 12:30. Woke up at 1:30 cause my mom was home and told me I had to get up. Even though I was so damn comfy in my bed. I got up and walked my dog. It was a nice walk, not too hot, not too cold, but Cody was bad and kept going into this one giant bush and eating something in the ground. He does this thing where he refuses to move. It's kinda annoying, he's a very stubborn, opinated dog. But I worry about him more now, because it takes him a longer time to get up and by the end of the walk (it wasn't that long) he was exhausted and it took him awhile to get up the driveway. My poor puppy. After the walk it was 2, I had a pbj sandwich and M&M's. Not at the same time mind you. My mom was home from work cause she didn't feel well so we watched lifetime together. Some good mother-daughter moments. I told her about the movie and the news blip on the woman who had sex with the 13 year old and she told me to stop cause she felt even sicker hearing that story. We watched the very exciting lifetime movie which I am not even going to begin to explain cause it's all very complicated. Let's just say it has a amnesiac woman, a good looking cop, a PI guy who gets shot, a fat nice lady, and this weird couple who ended up being her husband and her sister.  Yeah.  Anyways after that we watched a tv show. By the time that was over it was five, I started to do my wash, and I took a nap while listening to the Goo Goo Dolls. I always play the 5 songs on there that I really like. Slide, Black Balloon, All Eyes On Me, Acoustic #3, and of course Iris. I still love that cd and I got it when I was in 5th grade maybe which is funny. I like pretty much all the songs, those are my favorites, the only ones I hate are the ones sung by Robby. God, he's horrible. I woke up. I had dinner. Chicken, incase anyone wanted to know. I then went on here. So now I am going to go clean my room. And take a shower later. Then read a bit and go to bed.  Oh yes, and tomorrow should be fun, I'll be hanging out with Sean. He wants to come over though at 9:30 IN THE MORNING. So I have to set my alarm clock tonight. We're going to see two movies...The Village and Napoleon Dynamite (sp?). So very good.

      It's a nice word, no? I get random bouts of real dizziniess. They may last for only a couple of seconds but they are annoying. Like I am walking and there it is. And five minutes later, another one. It doesnt matter where I am. It always happens.  On other news...  I am completly distracted by the television being on.  Dude, I just had a dizzy moment.  Um, so. I  OH MY GOD! THE LADY GOT OUT OF JAIL! It was just a news blip right there...about the lady from the movie I saw the other day. The one who had sex with a 13 year old. I SAW HER ACTUAL PICTURE! AND HIS PICTURE! The guy said "Whether or not they resume their relationship...she is a registered sex offender." My. God. I can't believe I just saw that. Such a concidence I saw the movie then a 30 second news blip on it. Fasinating. And I'm so going to keep up with this story cause now I am interested. But why, Kate, are you interested in a lady who had sex with a 13 year old??....  Ok sorry I just saw the rest of the story on the lady getting out today. They want to get back together!! It's crazy. Now I am just interested in this story cause of that movie. Damn you Lifetime! Getting me intersted in weird stories!!   Oh and by the way...Fuck Bush.  I just had to get that out.

      But I am going through a whole range and mix of emotions over a certian subject in my life. I'd really like your comments, Katie and Jessica, the people who read this about maybe what I should do. I don't know....And I don't care anymore if she's going to read this. I really don't. Who says I cannot express my feelings completly open if she insited everytime to tell me what she had to say through a livejournal comment publicly? Anyways I don't know if I want to continue going to youth group this year. I went to youth group last year mainly because Cathy was there and after awhile I got to know some of the people and they were all really cool people. I didn't really make any real connections with anyone, but I thought they were all cool and interesting none the less. So youth group I guess is going to start again, and I don't know what to do. To go there would be awkward with Cathy but I guess I would get to see all the other people. I am not sure though what they really thought of me, if they really did like me or not. It's not I ever hung out with them or talked to them outside of youth group. And I don't know if I would feel right going there. I mean, the whole reason I went is because Cathy invited me, if I was to go, I'd feel bad because the whole reason why I am there is because someone who doesn't consider me a friend invited me there. Like I'd feel more or less unwanted. The whole reason I was there was because of Cathy and now since of all this I am not sure if it's appropriate for me to come. Sure, she said it's fine and everyones welcomed but I don't know if that's really true. I am already an outcast on so much and I really don't want to become even the outcast of a youth group. So I am not sure if I should even bother. All the pain and saddness from this whole experience is still with me. Some of it has faded but the majority of it is still there. I dont know. I mean, I've lost friends, who hasn't, but I've never lost one so abrubtly. Like that final conversation. That was it. The End to the friendship. It was all over in a matter of minutes. And that friendship had meant a lot to me, considering it's really hard for me to make friends here. I just feel so stupid. I told her so much about me, more than I've told some people I've known my whole lives, and it's all just wasted. And what hurts the most is that she can do that and be fine. I almost feel like that time we were friends meant absloutly nothing to her, she can blow if off as easily as it started. Or maybe I'm just being stupid about all of this. And I'm too sensitive and I'm blowing it out of proportion. Like I always do I guess. I still have that list she wrote on my livejournal about all my faults and I can't get them out of my head, everytime I feel like crieing now I think "God Kate your so stupid and overreacting again." Fuck Star. Anything I gained from that experience, I lost double. Just Fuck it.  "Don't attempt to cut yourself with a dull pair of scissors a hundred times.".....Don't worry, I won't. It's not even worth it.

      So today I have watched some interesting television. I gave up on the Unsolved Mysteries and went back to sleep for two hours. After that it was time for the afternoon lifetime movie!!!! This one was...disturbing. It was about a 32 year old 6th grade teacher falling in love with her 13 year old student. Based on a true story too. And I mean, she had a kid who was 13 too. So wrong. I think they were trying to get across that they were really in love, but it was just...wrong. And this kid was really persuasive too. I just thought this woman though was weak to let a 13 year old seduce like that...I mean, isnt this channel about empowering women? So it turns out she gets pregnant by this kid, the husband finds out, and she goes to jail for rape. By the way she's telling this whole story from jail to the shrink. On her court date she gets parole, but is not allowed to see her 4 other children or have contact with the 13 year old boy. But they are still soo in "love" with each other and the boy keeps calling her and they end up running away together. But they don't get far, cause the police catches them and she goes back to jail. And it turns out she is pregnant again. So she has a total of two kids with the 13 year old boy. The movie ends with her still being in jail and saying she won't get out till 2005...All I think is that I hope they make a sequel cause I want to find out what happens after she gets out....  Um, then tonight I watched "Trading Spouses" on none other then FOX. Obviosuly it's on FOX. It was kinda stupid, just these two complete opposite mothers switch families for a week and you get to see the chaos. What happens when an overweight loud Massachusetts woman switches familes with a fit happy California woman?...Just a lot of bickering. I feel bad for the California family who got stuck with the Mass. lady cause she's a bitch.   I should maybe one day stop wasting my youth on watching television. I swear, I don't have many memories from my childhood, but the things I do remember fondly is about me basically growing up watching VH1. When it still had to do with music. Let's just say I know a lot of useless information on randon music careers. For example...Did you know the guy who wrote "Sex and Candy" (awseome song by the way) had parents who were shrinks? Or that group called Four Non-Blondes, who had one hit, only came up with the name by coming to the smart conclusion they were all brunettes? Yes, Thank you Pop Up Video, for letting me remember these facts for the rest of my life.

       Ok, so here I am. Again in the morning. Not having anything on television except for Dawson's Creek, kiddie shows, and really bad music videos. Especially those rap music videos. They all, always have the following... -Girls with "booty" -Way too much "bling" -Cars that jump -Little children. If you don't belive me on the last one, just watch one, there is always little children. Which confuse the hell out of me, cause like...What? Anyways, so in the morning I am forced to watch Dawson's Creek. Which is painful in itself because it is the sappiest show I have ever watched. They have wayyyyyyyyy too many problems. I think I would kill myself if I had that many problems. And just taking turns sleeping with everyone I know would be confusing for me. God, don't these kids realize that people are starving all over the world and here they are moaping about how Joey broke up with Pacey???? I'm sorry, maybe I should just turn off the tv. And all this kissing in this show just makes me depressed. I swear, if their not kissing they are either crying or expressing their feelings which either leads to kissing or crieing. If life was like that I think I would be crieing most of the time. Cause since no one wants to kiss poor lil Kate :( hahaha....    ANYWAYS...I just finished eating my bagel. I see that my family has gotten into my bagel stash and now there are only 2 left for the entire week. But that's ok. And I am not going to go off on my bagel tangent. DAMNIT now Save by the Bell is on. But thankfully at noon, Unsolved Mysteries is on so I just watch that. I just love those Unsolved Mysteries. The music though is just a wee bit creepy. Ah, damn, it's about aliens, I might have to turn the channel.   So today will be another exciting day in my life. That will consit of me being in my pajamas for most of the day and taking turns from the tv to the computer. So I'm looking forward to seeing Sean on Friday cause it will give me something to do AND I'll be seeing Sean. Even though my parents might kick us out of my house a little bit early, since my parents want to go to the beach or something...Stupid me not having a car. Um, or lisence.   Why are all the alien sightings in deserted areas? Like, why not a big city? This bugs me. If i was an alien I'd go to a big place. Not Roswell. And who wants to go to Arizonia anyways? Whatever.

      So here I am on Blogspot. I abandoned my livejournal. I hope your happy Jessica! Now since I am Jessica's friend and I am on her "home turf", I am forced to be using correct grammer or Jessica might shoot me. Since you know it's been a couple of intense months of her trying to get me to switch over to blogspot. With all the blackmail in cut up newspaper letters, strange phone messages with the Darth Vader voice, and I must say the horse's head in the bed was a tad too much and very unorignal. So Jessica, I have given into your peer pressure with the constant "Come on Kate! All the cool kids are doing it!" and have finally given in.  So ..I am here. Um. I didn't do much today. Like all other days. I woke up and had a bagel. That's actually new for me, I normally don't have bagels for breakfast. Now I was trying to come up with the real reason for the hole in the middle of the bagel while eating it and decided it's for fashion purposes only. And that the bagel was jealous of the donut, cause let's face it, the donut gets a lot more attention, so it was just following the crowd. Except the donut in the long run was better off with the hole, cause it's made that whole business on "donut holes", just incase you know, people really need that part of the donut. Now who wants a bagel hole? But then again, this is America, and us Americans need the damn donut hole cause it's unhealthy and we're all fat and need the extra calories. If we only had bagel holes, what kind of society would that be? A crazy society let me tell you. I mean, can you imagine someone walking into a party and saying "I bought bagel holes!". "Oh thanks Joe. That was awfully kind of you. I might have to kill you now." I can completely picture that situation. And now some of you may be thinking, now Kate, what kind of person brings donut holes to a party anyways?...Rhode Islanders do. You know why? Because Rhode Islanders are OBSESSED with donuts. There is a donut place every five miles. Dunkin Donuts is the king here. It dominates all the others. But the others still survive. I've never had so many variations of donuts in my life until I moved here. I feel bad for the diabetics.  But at the rate of the Dunkin Donut business most of Rhode Island will be a diabetic in the near future.
