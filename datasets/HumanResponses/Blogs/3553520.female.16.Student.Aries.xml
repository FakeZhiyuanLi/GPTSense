      I fucking hate you.  You think its okay to do this.  To get on my case.  And yell. And scream.  And grab me like all I am is a ragdoll.  You wouldnt put up with me if I ever tried any of this.  But you continue to do so.  You yell. You scream.  Then you calm down enough just to talk bitterly at me.  You say the meanest things.  Do you understand what you're saying?  Do you understand your words make me want to slit my wrists so I can never hear you again?  Dont you fucking get it, mom?  You're the reason I'm this way.  And to think I protected you. To think I defended you.  Fuck you. Fuck you.  I dont understand.  "Youre going to have a hard life, Kristine.   Be thankful you have a roof over your head and food to eat right now.  Because you might not have it in the future."  Maybe I wont. Maybe just because of this  And all the other times this has happened   I wont. Maybe I will just finish this.  I'll end it. Then you wont have to worry anymore.  You can fucking get on with your life.  I'm sorry you adopted me. I guess you didnt get what you wanted.  Dont you wish they had a return policy on children?  Oh sorry, shes a fucking fuck up. A fucking loser.  I dont want her anymore.  Take her back. Can I have my money back?  Oh dont worry, just put it on the card.  Fuck you. Fuck you.  I'm not worth it anymore.

      Its been twenty-four hours.  I dont know what to think.  Did he go through with it?  I have to assume so.  I could have stopped him.  But I didnt.  Perhaps I couldnt have changed his mind.  So now I'm left waiting to read his name -  [In the Irvine Obituaries]

      [And you said 'My life is like a bad movie,' and I said, 'Thats true of all of us']  I need something to focus all of my attention on.  And the paper thats waiting to be written isnt going to be it.  I need something. I need someone.  I need .s.o.me.t.h.ing. else.  Fuck it. I cant pay attention.  I need more drugs. I need more pills.   --> "And dont say no to pills."   This song could be my anthem.  I'm not sure if I'm proud of that fact.

      |Make the same mistake :t:w:i:c:e:|  Once, twice, third times the charm?   Perhaps? But it seems as if I've started over so many times.  Still breeding the same outcome.  I feel like a failure. I'm running into the wall once again.  I see the signs. I see the lights, but I never see the wall.  Three more days, and then I'm free.  I'll never have to go back there again.  Three more days and my life is over.  Because I dont know where I'm going after this.  Sure, I know whats planned. But thats never the problem.  Its what I dont plan for. Its what I dont see coming.  That I run into again and again.  "Hello, wall. Its nice to see you again."  Except I never see him. I just run blindly until I can feel his abrasive touch once again.  Story of my life.  Story of my death.  Whats coming next? Life, [version 1.6].

      Letter I wrote Clayzor about babysitting the kitten tomorrow:  + + + +  Instructions for .l.3.3.7.k.i.t.t.y.z.o.r.  Separation anxiety like |m|a|s|s|i|v|e|.   Okay. So Georgia is awesome, you should know that by now.   You need to feed her at nine o’clock, noon and four. All she eats is a [little] teaspoon of the wet food all smooshed up so it’s easy to chew.   Lets see, give her some water every once-in-a-while and plop her in the cat box on the hour(ish). Hopefully she won’t take a dump on your carpet or something, that would be depressing.   Other than that she’s pretty .ea.s.y. Be gentle, but don’t worry about messing around with her – She’s a tough cookie. ^.^ /meow/  I’ll stash some of her kitty treats in with her as well, if she looks a little famished just remember this; ‘Dooooo it!’ Oh yeah. Best advice ever.  Hum. What else … She loves to chill with you, so just let her on your lap whenever you have a chance.   .Wa.r.n.in.g: Major bonding sessions ahead.  I don’t know what to tell you. Have fun. Be safe. Use protection. [Haha, gross. Please don’t have sex with poor little Georgia, it might be a little traumatic for her.]  W00t. You’re my hero.  - The Teenster.  + + + +  I've got to get through this.   Why am I so goddamn attached?

Lived in Ohmaha, Nebraska until his parents divorced. Moved near Dallas, Texas with his mother. Decided to play bass at age five. [Inspired by the White Album] Picked up playing the piano by nine, for one year. At age ten, Elliott began drinking alcohol. Began playing Clarinet during middle school. During the late seventies Elliott visited his father in Portland. When he was twelve, his father gave him his first guitar. By fourteen, Elliott had begun using marijuana. In the mid-seventies, Elliott began experimenting with recording. His freshman year he moved from Texas to Portland. He lived with his father, a psychitrist:  "I would have liked to have done the same job. I've read a lot on that subject; particularly Freud. But anyhow, I was never the type to become a psychiatrist or a psychologist; I don't have enough to offer other people. As a kid, I wanted to be a mathematician, but then I realized I'd ever be able to be independent, that I'd have to work for a business or some other organization. I turned back to my one passion-music ..."  Elliott attended Lincoln High School. His first band was "Stranger Than Fiction", which made several tapes. In 1986 [age 17] he wrote "Condor Avenue" - ended up on "Roman Candle." Elliott graduated named a National Merit Schollar at Lincoln. Attended Hampshire College - Political Science / PHilosophy. Formed the short-lived "A Murder of Crows" Met Neil Gust, who wrote gay-themed songs: "homocore" or "queercore." They formed the band "Heatmiser" and began playing in 1992. Two years later they released "Yellow No. 5" and "Cop and Speeder." Elliott didnt like the music he played and could not relate to it. Eventually, Elliott went solo and released "Roman Candle."  .d.i.s.c.o.g.r.a.p.h.y.  --> Roman Candle, 1994 - "Drive All Over Town" --> Elliott Smith, 1995 - "St. Ide's Heaven" --> Either/Or, 1997 - "Pictures of Me" --> XO, 1998 - "Bled White" --> Figure 8, 2000 - "Stupidity Tries" / "Bye"  Later, Elliott's song "Miss Misery" was put on the soundtrack for Gus Van Sant's movie "Good Will Hunting" which earned him an Academy Awards nomination.  In late 2003, Elliott was recording the tracks for his upcoming album "From A Basement On A Hill." Sadly, he died in October of the same year.  Eliott's death was ruled suicide by a stab wound to the chest, but many close to him believe he was killed by his girlfriend, JJ something-or-rather.   Police are still investigating his death and the possible homicide.  Elliott's family and friends hope to release the album in late 2004 and donate all the profits to the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund.

"Do you want to check your IMs?"  "Uh? What?"  "I'm going to disconnect your computer from the internet."  What the fuck?! Okay. Not only this, but yesterday she unplugged the keyboard,  Took my cell phone,  And yelled at me for an hour.  So, I get up. Go to check my e-mail and get the directions for the girls that have to come over today...  AND THE FUCKING COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF.  Why does she keep turning it off?!  Its my computer!  First the keyboard. Then the modem... AND NOW YOU'RE TURNING IT OFF?  What the hell.  I give up. I'm pissed.  And on top of that, there were three really important voicemails that I didnt get because she had to be all high and mighty and take my cell phone.  [Screams]

Why is it everytime I see a glimpse of her I start to cry?  My life is falling apart.  Over two other lives that I've taken in.  And now I'm going to lose both.  One by choice. One by chance.  Its all going to be gone.  And then what? Then what do I do?  I can only hope I feel better than I feel now.  Because right now  I dont want to know what feelings are.

      I have a very sexy sunburn.  --> If by sexy you mean incredibly unattractive, then yes.  [Sports bra + tank top - SPF = Hot like fire.]  I think I burned my lips as well.  Oh man, [sarcasm] "life is hell."

      Clay's alarm = suckage hxc.  He didnt get to kittysit.  [sigh]  Camping was fun. Mucho random goodness.  Cold weather. Wind. Kyacking. Hiking like theres no [tomorrow].  --> MEXICAN RAP.  What a good time.  Came home to an empty house. It was a *w*e*e* bit sad.  I take that back. It was very sad.  I was so pumped in the car to see my family   That I almost .p.i.s.s.e.d. myself.  [sigh-age] So sad. Sad indeed.  My grandfather gave me the quilt my grandmother didnt get to finish before she died.  He drove all the way up here from Santa Barbara to do it in person.  He told me all the stories behind it.   And give me a book that the women that finished it made.  I was almost in -tears- but I didnt want to cry.  I hate it when people see me .c.ry.  Went to Pizzacato with my mom tonight. That was good.  We have very deep conversations.   About people.   And places.  And things.  Basically your everyday [proper] nouns.  Got a phone call tonight.  Strange to me. But probably not to the rest of the world.  |Someone tell me|, [whats going on?]

      I've decided its too much work worrying about clothes and make-up and hair and such.  Its so not worth it.  Yeah, its okay to want to look nice once-in-a-while, but I dont understand the girls who wear heels everyday with   mini skirts straightened, dyed hair loads of make-up and a perfect tan.  I used to be more like that.  But theres a spectrum, with two extremes.  Where do I lie now? In the middle? Towards one end?  I dont think it matters.  As long as you're happy, as long as you're content why should you need a classifaction?

      [un]written letters. [un]stamped envelopes. [un]addressed futures. [un]declared loves. [un]kept promises.  --> [un]finished lives.  + + + + +  blank pages and empty lines make me wonder if this life is worth living pour your heart into broken love for nothing   no one stops [for you] no one notices [you]   no one cares [about you] this is all a waste of time  + + + + +  I shouldnt be allowed to write pointless things in the middle of the night.

      Oh man. What a headache.  Didnt get too much sleep last night.  Fell asleep on the couch and woke up at one thirty not knowing what had happened.  Went upstairs, couldnt sleep. So I read until three-ish.  Merh. Woke up at seven to the sounds of my dad fiddling in the garage.  Wasnt sure what time it was since I dont have a functioning clock in my room as of now.  So I read some more and realized how early it was a while later.  Got up anyway.  So tired. My stomach hurts.  I give up.

      I pierced my nose last night.  I didnt think I could actually do it.  --> But I did.  Ended up not really liking the placing of it.  Took it out, but I'll redo it as soon as I get an actual nose stud.  Maybe my mom will actually take me to get it done.  Professionally.  No sewing needles, alcohol, [handfuls] of Aleve or ice involved.  [ponder ponder]  I doubt it.
