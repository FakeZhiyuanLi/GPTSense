      I sadly enough got in a car wreck this morning. I was on my went to practice when I ran off the road. I was driving down the mountain and my car slid and ran off the road and hit a tree. Luckily I was fine, but the car wasn't. They people at the car shop place said that it might be totalled. So.. I might a new car *ekk* that was a good ekk.. but I'll miss the one I had, "The Neon." When it first happened I was bawling and then I car my dad thinking that he was going to yell at me. I never felt this bad in my life. My life just flashed before my eyes and I thought in that mid second, I hope I live.

      It's been that long!! Half a year!! I still can't believe it. Me and Zach have been dating that long. ;) I love him soo much!! I never have got mad at him, believe it or not, lol.. and we never have gotten into a fight. Last night I went over to his house and we were under a tornado warning and Wyatt, Katie, Zach, and I had to all get in the hallway. Then since it was pouring down rain, Zach and I stayed inside instead of skating. Today I have to go to Altar Server practice then tonight I have to serve. I don't know what I'm doing in between. Tomorrow I have to go to church and sign up for CCD!! ;) I'm excited!!  *Sorry for the whole not writing in forever thing. It wouldn't let me at first, then I have been busy and forgot all bout it*   urlLink http://www2.fanscape.com/ashleesimpson/audio/POM.asx  ^.. go there.. ^
