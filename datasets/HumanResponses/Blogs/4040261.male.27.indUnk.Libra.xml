        I'm late, I know...but...FEH!    My Friday was going smoothly right between  2pm  and  3pm .  Not many calls, not much work, etc.  But then all of the sudden at  3pm    SHABLOOIE!   tons of work, more phone calls, and a boat load of morons from every  direction !!  I was going    insane   !   However, I won't detail it...I've been doing that all week...so instead, let me tell you about a wonderfully magical film entitled   "The Village."       The     V  --Vile   I  --Idiotic   L -- Lame   L  --Ludicrous   A -- Annoying   G -- Garbage   E  --Extravaganza!    Yess  !    The Village   is one of the worst pieces of   corn-filled rat crap   to ever be put on the silver screen!  Sure it has some good   themes   in it.  Yes, a pretty good cast of well-respected actors, and yay! It even has good continuity!  However, without "  spoiling  " the movie for any one person who  may  read this; There is a major plot point that is revealed about half-way into the film, and then we're supposed to be sca red of this plot point twenty to thirty minutes later??  Also, I know blind people have a sort of " sixth sense " about  certain  things, but  C'MON!   (see it and you'll know what I'm saying.)  Did the music really have to be that somber for the whole   108   minutes?  Why do they advertise it as a vehicle for Joauquin (sp?) Phoenix??  There are so many questions in my head about this worthless waste of time and money and film that I can't think of all of them!  In  my  opinion, don't go see this at the theater, don't rent it when it comes to DVD, don't purchase it on pay-per-view, don't even watch it on  HBO/Showtime .  Because each of the    aforementioned    ways of viewing this film requires that money comes from you pocket.  No! Instead, wait until one of your friends (usually the  'stupid'  one) buys in on DVD and borrow from them...then  BREAK THE DVD IN HALF !  Or, you may choose to wait until it comes on ABC, because that's all free!  Don't be fooled and watch in on TNT on some  Friday ,  Saturday , and  Sunday  a couple of Summers from now!   NO  !  TNT  is basic cable, but you still have to pay for it!    I'm done venting!

       That's the way I was brought up.&nbsp; I'm sitting her at work with all of a   two   minute break and    KABLOOIE   ! A whole  bunch  of work suddenly appears on my computer like an Evil Wizard's spell!    ACK  ! &nbsp; Help me!   HELP ME!

       The reign of Pootie freedom has ended after about a week.&nbsp; It was a decision that came from the boss; "No, the kids are going home tonight!"   It was perfect!&nbsp; My kids come home with me after a long, hard, boring day of getting very little accomplished and a growing ear infection on my right side. Ugh!  So on the way home, the boss wanted me to stop by a Verizon store to get my "push to talk" updated.&nbsp; That was loads of fun.&nbsp; They take my phone, then tell me that the updating process takes about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; Now I get to hang out in a store with nothing but phones that are unusable and have to keep the kids entertained with a pounding, growing headache!  I was too worn out to make dinner so we stop by Steak N Shake on the way home.&nbsp; I order my usual, two Chili Mac supremes and the older child orders a full adult Chicken finger meal.&nbsp; Once again her eyes have proven bigger than her stomach because she chomps down ONE of the four chicken fingers and a handful of french fries.&nbsp; Why is it that the kids only wast MY money??&nbsp; Anyone else buys for them, the plate is clean!&nbsp; I buy food, five minutes later: "I'm fulllllll."&nbsp; But, of course, when it comes time to get the kids in bed, what happens?&nbsp; "I'm hungrrrrryyyy."  Now I'm finally home and getting the kids in the shower, and soon I shall veg in front of the TV and hold my head in pain.  Short post today people, I've got another couple of pet peeves I need to update!  Buh-bye.  &nbsp;

         Today I have decided to make an ever growing list of my pet peeves.&nbsp; From time to time I may update it, and other times I may ignore it.&nbsp; If I ever forget that I posted this, then I'll start a new one.      &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Anytime my wife says: " Can you do me a favor "  2. Anytime my boss says: " When you get a chance "  3. The ringing of  any  phone.  4. That stupid beep that   microwaves   make when it's done cooking something, and it's not being paid any attention.  5. The entire crew of the   CBS NFL Pregame show  .  6. Antonio Bandares  7. Melanie Griffith  8. The fact that    nothing    in the world changes after High School.  9. Sinus headaches.  10.  Alzheimer's Disease  (Why have a disease that does nothing but eat away your brain?)  11. Ear infections  12. Movies that are    NOT    in widescreen.  13.  Pokemon ,  Yu-Gi-Oh  or any other cheap  Japanimation  thing they shove down kids throats and command that they love!  14. Anything that has to do with    Lord of the Rings    (aka  Bored of the Rings )  15. Spike Lee  16. Asthma  17. Dial-up internet  18. Other people in traffic. (  I   know what   I'm   doing,   I   know where   I'm   going, so get out of  my way !!)  19. Earwax  20. The term: "I don't know."  21. Bill collectors  22. Timeshares  23. Neil Cavuto 24. For Love or Money (that NBC crapfest) 25. " Survivor " 26. " Next Action Star "

       Well, as if anyone cares...this was my  Wednesday :  Let's see...I had a hard time sleeping last night.&nbsp; I kept waking up seemingly  every  ten minutes for   no   reason.&nbsp; Maybe it was my rant yesterday that fueled my lack of sleepability?   So needless to say, I was    dead    tired when I got to work this morning and I had a whole pile of work, again!   But today, I finally did it, I told my boss to take the calls on his cell phone because they were driving me   CRAZY  .&nbsp; You should've seen me pick up that phone with a vegence every time it rang: " Hello !" which really meant: "   What the hell do you want   ?!"  So then I get a call, in one of the few slow moments of my day from the best woman on Earth;  Dedee Pfeiffer ! But then she said she had the wrong number and as soon as I hang up, the other best woman on Earth called, which is my wife!   My wife tells me that my little girls blood test came back  'normal' .&nbsp;   Don't congratulate me yet...this kid has gone to any type of doctor you can name because she's always sick, and yet whatever test is done comes back  'normal.' &nbsp; How is this possible?&nbsp; It's starting to  piss  me off.&nbsp; We need to put her on an all-fat diet so she actually starts to gain weight on top of her 35lb puny body!&nbsp; She's such a lovely, smart little girl and sometimes I get more angry at the overall situation, but I take it out on her!&nbsp; I'm   horrible  , I know.  But again, I'm home alone for the next half-hour alone.&nbsp; I'm now 'watching' " Last Comic Standing " in the background and I'm about to end this post..................... NOW!

       Welllllll let's see...  Today was a  rough  day at work.&nbsp;  Too much  crap going on.&nbsp; The phone ringing off it's stupid hook.&nbsp; Three friggin lines ringing at the same time.&nbsp; Then it all stopped so that I could type some stuff into the computer.&nbsp; Then, just as it all came to a close...  KABOOM!  &nbsp;  More  phone calls had to be made and taken and even  more  stuff had to be typed.&nbsp;   My boss calls me up in the middle of the day, when all the crap is hitting every fan possible and says:   "Ohhhh I'm sorry I couldn't be there...the tinting of my windows and my Rolex getting cleaned took a big longer than expected."  &nbsp; HA! Come November some stuff shall change! Mark my words!  Sooooo, then I get a call from my lovely, beautiful, sweet bodacious wife who says;   "Hey sweetie, let me tell you how much money I had to spend on doctors appointments and I'm going to go with my mom to play Bingo tonight"    It's not the money on the doctor's visits that gets to me, they're for my daughter.&nbsp; What does get to me is this:    All    the friggin doctors in the world do the same thing.&nbsp; My step-daughter is six, almost seven and she has about 4 "Specialists" and every one of these "Specialists" don't know what's going on with her.&nbsp; At  ALL! &nbsp; They check her throat, her lungs, her stomach yada yada yada...and all they've been able to discover is one fact: She's allergic to dairy.&nbsp;  All kinds! &nbsp;   So a good chunk of what my wife and I make in moolah goes towards hearing the same stuff over and over:   "I don't know what's wrong, but here's a months worth of perscriptions for $150 worth of medicine that she'll stop taking by the time I see her next."  &nbsp; followed by:   "Come back next week."    But, lucky for me my brother-in-law, who is also my boss said:   "Hey, why don't I watch the girls (my other step-daughter included) while you go home and your wife and my wife and mom go to Bingo."&nbsp;     So I got the  whole  house to myself!&nbsp; I could actually come home and sleep for a bit!&nbsp; Then I got to watch whatever the hell I wanted to on TV!&nbsp; I even got to watch    "Big Brother"    and    "Amazing Race"    before my wife!&nbsp; Now I get to ruin the ending!   YAY!    Which brings me to now...I'm typing the closing of this post. Enjoy it or don't, see if I care!

       I have three friends on this site and I'm just wasting time at work copying off them.&nbsp; I'm a loser that way.   I am a generic soul.&nbsp; I have but a dream of many things and stuff.&nbsp; I have many nightmares of stuff and things.&nbsp; I have absolutely no goals in life.&nbsp; Maybe I'll do something someday, but not soon...probably not even later.  Well that about sums it up for right now...I'm at work, leave me alone!  &nbsp;

       Ooooh how scary!!! AAACK!  I laugh at all these people surrounding me.  When is everyone around here, in my area, going to learn that Orlando is in the smack dab middle of Florida.  This being said;  IF  a hurrican were to smash into a coast of F-L-A and yell out   KAPLOWSKI!   by the time it got anywhere near Orlando, it would be  nothing  but a pretty bad thunder storm.  Maybe a couple of tree branches down...a couple of cars flipped over, a few foundations of rackety buildings would collapse, perhaps even a    few    renegade toothbrushes flow through the streets.   This is all stuff that can easily and cost efficiently be taken care of with a simple  wisk  of a broom and some good    french onion dip   .  My  wife  is freaking out.  She's all scared and stuff, bought    84 gallons of water ,  7,412 batteries , some  dry dog food  and a can of black olives.    This oughta take us through the misery of losing everything, huh?  *LAUGH!*    Anyway , I wanted to get some stuff so me and the family could make projects or something...something that doesn't require electricity and would occupy the kids time. But nooooooo the woman of the house wants to play Scrabble!  Yes, Scrabble with a 9 and 6 year old would be sooo much fun!   My word: Marker Wifes Word: Kilo 9 Year Olds word: Of 6 Year Olds word: BE  Loads of fun, I will tell you that much.  Anyhoo, it's gonna probably be another week before I post again, or not.

       It's amazing...it's the dead middle of the dog days of summer and I actually have time to write a new post in my blog!  Last night I got home from work and got to see my movie; Pootie Tang on HBO.  God, I love that movie!  It's such a ridiculous farce it's hilarious!  I'm thinking about doing a project over the weekend since I have off...it's gotta be something creative that you can wear...I wonder what I could do...hmmmm  Ironically since I now I have time to write, there's not much on my mind.  Therefore, I'm done!

       I don't even really feel like writing this post tonight.  I had such a horrible day and got next to nothing accomplished at work.  The only enjoyment I got out of the whole day was looking at the clock when it was 5:00 and saying to myself; "Let's burn this place down!"  But then, I got to thinking that I could get in a whole lotta trouble and I'd be out of a job, and that would be sooo much less porn I could purchase.  So this is all I'm gonna write because I'm flippin tired and I friggin stink!  Maybe I'll tell you about Monday on Tuesday, then Tuesday will be reserved for Friday.  On Wednesday I'll think I'll predict Saturday.  By the time Sunday rolls around I should be able to sum up both Wednesday and Thursday.  Finally, on Friday I'll tell you all about the adventures of Tuesday's with Morrie.  Ta-ta for now.

       Well, this is it blogachow.  The    final    day of Summer vacation for the kiddies.  No more sleeping in untl  8:15  in the morning!  No more staying up until  11:00  at night!  No more telling the kids to go get themselves something to eat for  breakfast .   Nooooooo  now Mrs. Tang and myself must wake our lazy bootays right out of our soft, wonderfully comfortable bed at a crisp   6:30   am so we can slap that snooze button and milk another   9 minutes   of pure escape from an early rise.  Oh how   wonderful   it will be to hear my lovely wife  yell  at the kids to get out of bed and get dressed   25   times in   12 minutes  , causing me to lose EVEN  more  sleep.  Then in turn making me get up, grab each child aside and look deep into their pupils and explain, in my typcally gruff morning voice, "   Listennnn...toooo.....yourrr....motherrr   !"  Ahhh and the kids...the poor childeren..they have to go to school for a whopping    25    days and they get a day off!   Labor day ..yes should be given off.  It's a national holiday and all that  crap .  But then! ten short days later..they get    ANOTHER    day off!  What is that all about?  I wish I could get a random day off every two weeks and I would   LOVE   if it was always a Monday!  So today I got to do something I kinda like...grocery shopping by myself.  Normally a guy wouldn't like doing that type of stuff, but  I   do . Why you may ask?....Ohhh you didn't ask...well then I won't answer.   Shut up !  Anyway, I'm tired and I got a mediocre amout of stuff accomplished today.  So, for now...  toodles  .
