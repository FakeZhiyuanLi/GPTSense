       urlLink  Are you kidding me  ? If ClearChannel and its, er, allies are worried that maybe satellite radio would do a good job providing local content,  they should start offering better local content themselves . But then again, that might not be, umm, cost effective.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Does the  urlLink August 6, 2001 PDB  say anything to you? Just this: some guy we know is probably planning an attack, is planning an attack.  The thing for me is that while the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were probably preventable only by better airport security, we're spending billions of dollars and losing hundreds of lives in an effort that's detracting from the war on terrorism -- remember Afghanistan? Yeah, we're in Iraq now, where Osama bin Laden isn't.  And speaking of Iraq, I just wanted to mention that certainly, Saddam Hussein needed to be removed. I don't dispute that. But (a) that's not the reason we were given why we were going into Iraq -- remember the WMDs that weren't there? -- and (b) we removed Saddam Hussein nearly a year ago. Then, 5 months ago, we captured him, and put him in captivity so that he could just sit there and not tell us about the WMDs that may or may not be there. I just don't think it's good that our elected leaders are lying to us. We pay their salaries, we deserve a bit of respect.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Bush and Kerry  urlLink will have spent $90 million on TV ads  by the end of the coming week. Where are these ads? With my recent addiction to the History Channel, I've seen them there, but not during The Simpsons, Friends, baseball games, arena football games, Stanley Cup playoff games or my local morning news. I thought young people were supposed to be an important demographic.   urlLink E-mail me .

      I received an e-mail last week that reads: "No joke: If the Palestinians put down their weapons, there would be no war. If the Israelis put down their weapons, there would be no Israel." What the people who have circulated that e-mail are missing is the fact that Palestinians first picked up their weapons because they were removed from their homes and jobs, and now even law-abiding Palestinians aren't allowed to go into Israel to try to earn enough to buy food for their families, never mind health care, clothing and good homes. If there were a truce, would that change? No way. If we want there to be a cease-fire on both sides, Israel is going to have to do some pretty hefty giving to the Palestinians.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Bob Woodward  urlLink has a new book out  about the war in Iraq. 74 of the 75 sources he spoke to spoke off the record (President Bush was the only one who went on the record). The problem with that? Woodward might have a history of falsifying sources. Mind you, he  might  have this history -- books have been written abou "Deepthroat," who probably is more than one source, and since his groundbreaking work on the Watergate scandal, Woodward his pretty much been allowed to use anonymous sources at his will. Maybe they'll ask him some real questions on Sunday on 60 Minutes. Maybe not -- Viacom owns both Woodward's book and 60 Minutes.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Apparently,  urlLink people aren't over Richard Clarke's interview  on CBS' "60 Minutes" last month. The problem: a Viacom subsidiary published Clarke's book, Viacom owns CBS, and nobody said anything on the air about the fact that it was a Viacom business promoting a Viacom business.  Media transparency is one thing. But should it make people any less suspicious of content? I say no. When "60 Minutes does its interview with Bob Woodward this week,  urlLink some say the show will indeed mention  that Viacom owns the company that is publishing Woodward's new tome.  Cheers for the honesty, folks, but the point is, none of the other news shows' editors evidently believes that Woodward's book is important enough to plug on a prime time news magazine. None except the editor who works for the company that published the book. Transparency does not necessarily equate to newsworthiness.  Of course, sometimes we can accept the newsworthiness of items, even if we need to look suspiciously at those items. When NBC reports on its parent General Electric's cleanup of the Hudson River, we should still be suspicous of any pro-GE commentary or angle, even though it's an obviously newsworthy item. We also have to watch out when PBS and NPR report on major contributors -- just because they tell us a company underwrites the particular program we're seeing or hearing, we shouldn't take what we see or hear at face value. We should question what is said, but we should also consider that the items are newsworthy. And if you want to talk about having to consider news items supspiciously, watch CNN sometime. The parent company own's AOL, Time Magazine, HBO, and just about every third CD you can find in your local record store, not to mention book publishing firms and movie studios. Oh yeah. And the Atlanta Braves.  A quick overview of the networks: ABC is owned by the Walt Disney Corporation (I'm sure you've heard of them). NBC, as I mentioned, is a General Electric property (you know, light bulbs, washing machines, and Katie Couric), and will soon be paired with a number of Universal's property's (including cable networks Bravo and Telemundo and Universal film and music studios). CBS is a Viacom company -- they own Infinity Radio (which broadcasts Howard Stern to the world), Blockbuster, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Fox is owned by News Corporation, which mainly specializes in movies through such studios as 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Films. News Corp. owner Rupert Murdock also owns the New York Post.   urlLink MediaResearch ,  urlLink The Media Education Foundation , and  urlLink MediaChannel  are some excellent media literacy organizations. The Columbia Journalism Review's  urlLink Who Owns What  page lists many of the major media companies in the U.S. and Canada (as well as some abroad) and what they own. It can be good reading, especially if you've recently picked up, say, The Chicago Tribune recently, or tuned into one of the 1300 ClearChannel radio stations -- you used to be able to own 7 FM and 7 AM stations in the country, and then Reagan and Clinton came along and took care of that in two measures.

      Check out  urlLink this article . Basically, big telephone companies -- the ones that built the U.S. telephone wire network -- are required to lease their lines to smaller companies that want to compete. It's an FCC requirement, and it's the only way that companies can compete for telephone service customers without building their own networks of wires (which would mean a new pole with wires between poles for each company that wants to provide service). Seem reasonable? I think so.  But the Bells disagree. They say that because their monopolies were legal when they built the network and the government allowed them to pass along the costs of building the network to consumers, that the networks are public property. Not true -- if you or I wanted to start up a phone company, we'd need access to those lines for our customers' phones to work.  The same problem is happening -- or should be happening -- in terms of cable television. Do you feel like you're paying too much for cable? Of course you do. Know why? Your town or city probably has one cable provider. If it has more than one, it's probably broken up by neighborhood so you still have a choice: cable or no cable -- not the choice of which cable company to go with. Cable companies lay their own cables in a city, and then contract with a city for service. Of course, if another company wants to contract with the city when the old contract is up, the new company either has to lease the cables from the company that laid them (assuming that company agrees to the lease), or has to lay its own infrastructure.  Cable companies should have the same requirements as the Bells. The Bells laid the cables, and if anyone wants to use them, they should be required to lease their use from the Bells -- and in the interest of competition, the Bells should be required to lease them at reasonable rates. But the same should be true for cable companies -- that would increase competition and lower rates, and perhaps even increase the quality of cable service.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Want a job at Carrier Corporation, the UTC-owned air conditioner company?  urlLink Here's one . Of  course, today's the last day of any manufacturing going on at the plant, so you might be the only one not in public relations or management working at Syracuse location.  The average employee who will not be continuing with Carrier -- there's 800 or so of them -- has been there for 29 years and makes over $16/hour. I hope a lot of new fast food joints open up -- at $5.15/hour, those 800 people are going to have to work 120 hours a week each in order to make up that lost income.  I bet, however, that the company will keep paying Syracuse University enough money to keep the naming rights to The Carrier Dome, where the Orangemen (and women) play their games.   urlLink E-mail me .

      My father doesn't speak much about news presentation (we talk a lot about current events, but not the reporting of them), but a couple of weeks ago, he made a stink about ABC's decision not to run photos of burnt U.S. citizens in Fallujah. CBS last night ran photos of Princess Di shortly after the accident that led to her death, and  urlLink people are putting up a stink  that they did so. Running the photos is probably the best decision CBS has made this year (see my previous comments on Richard Clarke and Bob Woodward). When you don't run newsworthy items, you pretend that the news you  do  run -- say, the "news" from the previous night's  American Idol  episode -- is more important.   urlLink E-mail me .

      See?  urlLink Here's what happens  when you write a book citing almost entirely anonymous sources. People take you seriously, question things that happen, and riddle their opinions with words like "might," "maybe," "could have," and "perhaps." I'm not disputing the fact that funding for the war in Iraq is questionable. I'm not disputing the fact that we just plain old shouldn't be there. But the problem with opinion pieces based on Bob Woodward's new book is that the book  might  just be a bunch of Woodward rantings -- President Bush is reportedly the only one who went on record for the book, of the 75 or so sources not-exactly-cited.  The problem with using anonymous sources is that as a reporter, you lose credibility. I understand that sometimes it's the only way to get information, or the only way to get people to let you use information. But Woodward's career has been based on anonymous sources -- and since his Watergate reporting (which featured Deepthroat, the mother of all anonymous sources, who was probably more like a half dozen anonymous sources), no one questions him.  I suppose I should reveal facts about the times I have used anonymous sources. There are two different reasons I have used anonymous sources: (1) It's often the only way you can get government officials to criticize other government officials; (2) it is the only way to get information. Usually, with #2, someone is willing to give you the information anonymously, and then tell you who to call to get it on the record. The only time I wasn't able to get someone on the record for #2 was this: I got four Massachusetts state prison officials to tell me  off the record  that the reason it was better to have separate prisons for men and women was that there were concerns about the sexual environment, particularly with regards to the safety of women. One even said, "You know why, I know why, I just can't tell you on the record."  But to write a whole book citing one source, and to pass it off as a major uncovering of facts is just, well, ridiculous. Maybe I can borrow it from the library and actually read it to tell you what I think, but I sure as heck can't shell out money and justify Woodward's use of anonymous sources.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Listen to this (audio-only) clip  urlLink of a brief snippet from CBS'  60 Minutes  . It's clear at the end that Mary J. Blige was going to say, "shit," whether or not you hear the whole word. The guy who got Howard Stern kicked off Clear Channel stations  urlLink has submitted an FCC complaint on the broadcast .  Whether or not you like it, certain words have crept into our vernacular. Bono and Blige -- who have used the words "fuck" and "shit" during recent broadcasts (OK, Bono's was a little over a year ago) as exclamatory phrases -- are not some young trash-mouthed kids with 10-word vocabularies. They're intelligent adults who have influence not just on the way kids see the world today, but in Bono's case, the world's politicians listen.  I think we're moving into an age when context  does  matter. Bono's declaration that his receipt of an award was "fucking brilliant" was obviously an off-the-cuff remark with absolutely, positively, no intent to offend anyone. That particular broadcast was live with no delay, so censors could not have cut him off. And they shouldn't have, anyway. It just happens that that's the way Bono speaks. So what? He wasn't describing sexual acts or excretory functions -- which is what the law says is obscene -- so just let it go.  Blige's exclamation, on the other hand, is a different situation. CBS had her saying, "shit," on tape, and could have edited it out. But you know what? It was an exclamation of disappointment, did not describe sexual acts or excretory functions, and furthermore, was broadcast on a show targeted at adults.  Come on, adults, grow up. This is the way people talk now, and maybe broadcast regulations -- and some people's attitudes -- could be brought up to speed. "Damn" used to be unbearably offensive, and we've mostly grown past that now. Let's grow past "shit" and "fuck" as exclamations. Let's take words in context, and let's not go overboard.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Yesterday -- Patriots Day in the U.S. -- was the anniversary of two events on American soil that many would like to forget: The Oklahoma City bombing, and the fire in Waco, Tex., that killed a number of Branch Davidians. But today's the fifth anniversary of an event many want to remember:  urlLink The school shootings by Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., of one teacher and 14 students (including themselves) . (The link goes to an article at Salon.com, but everyone's reporting it.) Best-selling books have been written and award-winning films have been made about the shooting, which I think most people now realize could have happened anywhere. These were, after all, two middle class white kids.  People tried to blame Marilyn Manson for the shooting. Even the shock rocker has said in interviews he's offended by the notion that he's to blame for the shooting. Who knows? Maybe we need to listen more closely. We know that violent television content is highly correlated with aggressive behavior in children (that's not to say the content  causes  aggressive behavior -- it might be that children who are prone to aggressive behavior choose violent content -- we just know there's a correlation; there have been too many studies over the past 30 years for their not to be a connection). Maybe there's something in song lyrics. Or maybe they heard wrong. Or maybe -- and I'd like to think this is true, as I'm sure Marilyn Manson does -- it's simply a coincidence that two kids who shot up a high school listen to something their parents probably hated (isn't that what kids do? find music their parents hate?).  At any rate, this entry really is just to remember, though I want to quote from the Salon.com article the items that were in Dylan's car that the guys  didn't  bring into school (I didn't get permission to re-post this, so if Salon complains, it'll come down):  "What has been only read about can now be seen, though not touched. And, for the first time, the enormity of the arsenal deployed that day can be grasped. Take the contents of Klebold's car, remarkable for the hate and premeditation they represent: five pipe bombs, three other incendiary devices, three 16-ounce propane bombs, two 5-gallon red gas cans, three 2-gallon, 8-ounce red gas cans, two 20-pound propane tanks, two and a half gallons of lane conditioner (a highly flammable substance used on bowling alleys), bottle rockets, bullets, fuses, nails and duct tape. And this was the stuff he didn't take into the school."  Wow.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Let's talk copyright infringement. Let's start with the  urlLink RIAA dropping its download amnesty program . In case you've been living under a rock since copyright law came into being, it's illegal to distribute or receive copyrighted material without paying the copyright holder. It's called  stealing . In case you've been living under a rock for the past few years, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) thinks that the free receiving of music -- that is, downloading music for free off the Internet -- has been causing a huge decrease in the sales of CDs. Personally, I think it's the ridiculous prices on CDs mixed with a down economy.  First, an aside. You can have a really really nice CD package put together for about $1.75 a disc if you're ordering 1,000 of them. If you're ordering more like 10 million of them, I'm sure that cost can come down to about 80 cents a disc. $100,000 would be just ridiculous for studio time (that's $200 an hour for 500 hours of work, and it doesn't take anyone that long to record an album -- if it does, you shouldn't be recording). Let's say a company puts in $1 million for marketing and distribution. We're up to, what? $9.1 million? Let's say that only 9 million discs sell, for an average of -- what do CDs cost now, $19? That's $171 million. Let's knock off, say, 20% for store markup. That comes to $127.7 million, and let's be nice and say the record company goes 50-50 with the artist (right, uh-huh). That's $63.85 million for the record company. At 15 songs on a CD, which I think is generous, that's over $4 million a song. In profit. With the same reasoning, people spent a bit over $1.20 a song, so that profit is finally eaten when over 3 million people get the song for free.  The RIAA has been prosecuting "people" it says have been downloading songs for free. The reason "people" is in quotation marks (a la  urlLink Jennifer Myszkowski ) is that mainly, the RIAA has been looking to prosecute IP addresses, which is how people are identified online. The thing is, service providers need to match the IP addresses with actual people, and most aren't willing to do so. So, the RIAA, representing record companies that share copyrights with artists, has been suing people for downloading free music on the Internet (which is what originally shut down  urlLink Napster , which is back).  Last September, the RIAA launched an amnesty program. People who had downloaded music for free (illegally -- see note about it being  stealing ) were welcome to come forward, write down their names and addresses, and delete the songs from their computers, with the promise the RIAA wouldn't sue them. The Association stopped the program today, after 1,108 people had taken advantage of the program. The RIAA says it will honor the amnesty for those who had signed up.  But what about the artists? It's bad enough that record companies get to share the artists' intellectual property. But let's say  urlLink Shawn Mullins  wants to sue somebody for downloading his music for free, and he has the person's IP address (not knowing who the person is), but that person has signed the amnesty agreement. Well, Columbia Records (a subsidiary of Sony) has promised not to sue, but Mullins hasn't. Now he has a name and address and everything, and it's all thanks to the amnesty program this person joined because he thought he wouldn't get sued. This, of course, is not to say that Mullins is looking to sue somebody (he's not, to the best of my knowledge), but I figured that since I had to pick an artist, I figured maybe you'd like to visit his Web site.  So, really, did this program mean anything?  Here's what I can offer, though. Visit  urlLink my music page , and you can download the 9 songs up there for free, and if you don't sell them to other people (that's called  stealing my money ) or try to claim them as your own, I won't sue you.   urlLink E-mail me .

      It must stink to be Alex Rodriguez. First, the Players Association vetoed his giving up $28 million to play for the Red Sox. Then, he went to Beantown for a 4-game series ( urlLink here's the box score from game 4 ), and went 1-for-17 -- the one hit was a single with 2 outs in the ninth inning of the last game. He also committed his first error of the season im that game. Did I mention he did it in a Yankees uniform, and was subjected to constant booing for 4 days -- and a fan flipped him off on the street during the series? Wow.   urlLink E-mail me .

I feel that when we do things like  urlLink put Bush's face in a collage with Hitler, bin Laden, and Milosevic near a headline that reads, "Who's a Fascist?,"  anybody who is left of right is opened up to ridicule and worse -- to be labeled a "Liberal." Which -- don't get me wrong -- I am, but still, when we all get tagged as liberals who think Bush is literally a fascist, we get filed in the "wingnut" category and nobody listens, unless we're preaching to the choir.   urlLink E-mail me .

      I'm surprised at Kerry's stated Israel policy, eliminating entirely the concept of Right of Return. For those not familiar with this policy: In 1967, Palestinians attacked Israel and were pushed back to the West Bank and Gaza strip. Many Palestinians gave up their homes in Israwl either to fight or to get away from danger. Since Israel captured land in that war, Palestinians -- friendly or not -- have not been allowed back to their homes. President Bush (the current) is the first president who has not supported right of return, and Kerry said he absolutely supports Bush on it.   urlLink E-mail me .

      In James Korn's  urlLink Illusions of Reality , the author argues that one American researchers and the American people at large accept the use of deception in research is that we're used to deception in everyday society. He specifically points to deception in political campaigns. It's sad, but true: we assume we're being deceived when we see political ads (even if we believe the deception is merely exaggeration). Kerry did well to point out the deception in Bush's ad (the one in which Kerry is shown saying, "I voted for the $87 million before I voted against it"), but he doesn't admit that people believe it, that it's influential, or that he's certainly going to use some of the same tactics throughout his campaign.   urlLink E-mail me .

      Tonight's edition of  urlLink Nightline  will reportedly consist entirely of Ted Koppel reading the names of the people who have been killed in the Iraq war. Sinclair Broadcasting, owner of the ABC affiliate in Springfield, Massachusetts (among other stations across the country, including the Fox and WB affiliates in Syracuse, NY), has joined other affiliates in the decision to not broadcast the news show, saying Koppel has  urlLink a political agenda  with regards to the war in Iraq. The station asks why Koppel didn't read the names of all those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  Meanwhile,  USA Today  dedicated the bulk of its front two pages to April being Iraq's deadliest month. While the story  urlLink is pretty difficult to find on the Web site , it took up the three middle columns on the front page, and all of page 2 discussing who has died and when. I think it's the first time I'm ever going to utter (or type) the phrase "I commend  USA Today ," which will hopefully improve greatly under  urlLink new editor Ken Paulson .

      It was, perhaps, a year ago when I spoke to Sonia Oppenhein (of  urlLink It Happens Every Day  and  urlLink P.A.C.E. ) about General Electric. She was boycotting their products -- as in light bulbs and appliances and such. She didn't need a jet engine or a power plant turbine or anything. She had no idea that the company owned NBC. "I can't boycott  Friends ," she said. The thing is, it's getting hard to boycott any one company. If you can handly boycotting the light bulbs, the jet engines, and  Friends , you still have to boycott  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy , anything on Universal records or from Universal Film Studios, and anything on Telemundo, the world's most popular Spanish channel. Now, GE is  urlLink in danger of not being the world's largest company anymore . Not that I'm said about the de-throning. It's more the fact that another company is approaching the size of GE. Scary.

      You know the myth of the liberal media? That the news media are so liberal as a whole that no conservative could get a fair shake? Look at  urlLink this article about Teresa Heinz Kerry . It's worded -- particularly the headline -- to piss off conservative abortion foes. Basically, here's the deal. The wife of the most liberal U.S. senator on Capital Hill, who is most assuredly pro-choice,  before they met  (she was married to someone else), was undergoing a medical program that required, for her safety and her baby's, that she have a legal, safe abortion.  Why is it that some pro-lifers (and I write from my conversations with some who are openly anti-abortion) don't seem to understand that "pro-choice" doesn't mean "abort all babies"? I know of a case in Springfield, Mass. in which a man walked into an abortion clinic wearing a sandwich board depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe. The clinic doubles as a community medical clinic, and he approached a young girl and told her she was the luckiest person in the world, because her mother chose to have her. (I know it happened because he told me he did this.) How frightened would that child have been? She was there to see her doctor, and some strange guy comes up to her wearing a sandwich board and tells her she's lucky her mother wanted her?  Incidentally, in case you're curious: the man was handed a trespassing citation, and showed up to the hearing with the sandwich board. He was advised to get a lawyer, and told the judge he had brought Jesus with him. He told me this proudly. I'm sorry. I just don't get it.

      I want to first thank  urlLink The Smoking Gun  (TSG) for their very existence. When I interviewed one of the reporters who founded the organization, he said, "we thought this stuff would be of interest." It is.  TSG filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Federal Communications Commission for comments regarding an episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show on which the host spoke with a guest about sex among teenagers. People complained most about the conversation which included the definition of "tossing the salad:" to perform oral sex on one's partner's anus.  The great thing about the 14 e-mails TSG posted is that some of them would absolutely not get me to act at all -- many threaten FCC Chairman Michael Powell or call him names. Others, however, actually sound intelligent. As a public service, I will here summarize them for you.   urlLink Letter 1.  Ooh, ooh, my favorite. Creative use of acronyms.

I have to say that if someone told me to eat shit, I would go out of my way  not  to fulfill any request in the letter.  urlLink Letter 3.  I guess I'll go easy on this writer. My only comment would be that if you're going to write to the government, know your grammar, close your quotes, and don't demand a personal response. I think that was easy. Right?  urlLink Letter 4.  Please ban free speech? Are you joking? Oh yeah. There was that thing about the writer's child's head literally exploding.  urlLink Letter 5.  No, no. No comment, you have to look at it. It's just so professional and the type of thing you would send to a government official. Maybe it  is  a bad thing we can e-mail our officials. It just encourages this sort of letter.  urlLink Letter 6.  This one's to Commissioner Michael Copps, and instead of targeting the commissioner, the writer calls Oprah "tool of the devil" and a "Mother of Harlots." Class-y, I say.  urlLink Letter 7.  Whatever happened to righteous indignation? ACT LIKE A MAN, YOU PUPPET! Why would you call someone a puppet nicely, and then ask nicely for him to "act like a man?" If you're going to be rude, don't be half-assed about it.  urlLink Letter 8.  This is a well-written letter from a teacher, except that she should have asked for a fine. If that's what she wants, why would she point out that she's not asking for one?  urlLink Letter 9.  Oh wait, I have nothing to say about this letter. It's direct and polite.  urlLink Letter 10.  "you stupid ass hitler wanna be." And another letter that seems to dare Powell to act -- and then the writer calls him a jerk off.  urlLink Letter 11.  Here's a good nickname: Puppetman. Here's another letter that almost dares Powell to impose a fine.  urlLink Letter 12.  I think this student's just looking for an A.  urlLink Letter 13.  This letter is addressed to Copps, a Democrat. This one isn't actually that bad, but perhaps there could be more emphasis on the  stop the madness!!!!   urlLink Letter 14.  This writer has no compunction about calling Powell "Nigger" over and over, but censors the words fuck and shit. Isn't this a hate crime or something?  Now there. Wasn't that refreshing?  Oh, so you want to know what I think? Personally, don't you want to know what your teenager is doing, and what she or he is talking about? If it takes sexually explicit talk on Oprah for parents to be in the loop because they won't talk to their kids about what they're doing, so be it.   urlLink E-mail me .

      I offer you paragraph 3 of  urlLink an article from Netscape News :  "[Michael] Copps was one of two dissenters in the five-member [Federal Communications C]ommission's vote last June to ease regulations on media ownership. That ruling was motivated by the notion that the strict regulations in place -- intended to protect against monopoly of the airwaves -- became obsolete with the proliferation of such information and entertainment sources as the Internet and cable."  Cable television and Internet access enter our homes when an adult voluntarily calls someone, asks for a service, and pays for it. Meanwhile,  everybody  pays for broadcast radio and television -- the public owns the airwaves, and through tax dollars funds the FCC, which is supposed to regulate things like ownership of radio stations.  It used to be that a company could own 7 FM and 7 AM stations in the country. Now, a company can own 7 FM and 7 AM stations in a single market. In some markets, that means there is literally no competition.  One line of thinking is, "So what? It doesn't matter who owns the stations, they'd all play the same music." Well, other than that being not true, there's a true matter of public responsibility -- and safety. We'll come back to responsibility in a moment. In terms of safety, if, say, the top 6 stations in one market are owned by one company, there will probably only be one office. That office is likely staffed with one or two disc jockeys per shift per station during the day (some stations will use pre-recorded or long-distance feeds during night-time -- and some day-time -- shifts), one producer/engineer per station, someone answering phones, and a single sales staff for all 6 stations. There's a shared news director, meteorologist, and traffic reporter for all the stations.  If, during the day, a catastrophe hit that market, the vast majority -- maybe 85% -- of listeners would likely be listening to one of those stations. The single news director may or may not be able to get out of the office, and likely doesn't have any reporters to send out to actually see what's going on. If something happens to the company's broadcast antenna, 85% of listeners won't hear anything. If the catastrophe happens at night, chances are there's someone working for just above minimum wage making sure everything is on and there's no dead air, since everything has been pre-programmed. This person won't be able to report on the catastrophe, and indeed, there are no people for that company to go out and cover, say, a sudden flood or an earthquake -- disasters that people often first tune in to their radios to hear about.  Then there's the responsibility a station has to offer a diversity of views. If a company is subscribing to a show -- say, Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh -- the company will probably get a package deal for subscribing to the show for all 6 of its stations, so 85% of the listeners in the market will hear the same point of view.  OK. I'm done for now.  urlLink E-mail me  if you wish.

      ABC tonight is showing M. Night Shyamalan's film  Unbreakable . I found it interesting that at the beginning of the movie, the network put up a warning not only that the film has some violent content, but also that viewers might be sensitive to some of the content due to "recent events" -- that is, the movie opens with a train wreck.  And by the way, ABC's doing this 2 Days of Night thing. The network showed Shyamalan's  The Sixth Sense  last week. Last week, the movie was accompanied by the first showing of the trailer for the director's upcoming  The Village . Tonight, there's going to be a 7 1/2-minute excerpt from the new movie. It's really irritating to me that ABC hasn't disclosed how it obtained this "exclusivity:" The Walt Disney Co. owns both ABC and Touchstone Pictures, which is distributing the film.

      Stanley Modarsky  urlLink was too fat to ride the roller coaster , according to his mother. The 55-year old, who, according to his 82-year old mother, weighed over 225 pounds and had cerebral palsy (she doesn't cite the disability as a reason he shouldn't have been on the coaster, just his weight), and should not have been allowed on it. The Americans with Disabilities Act (which amusement parks follow better than many government buildings, by the way), mandates that the park allow riders with disabilities to ride as long as they can get on the ride by themselves.

      The  urlLink Minority Media & Telecommunications Council  has written a letter to Congress ( urlLink download PDF ) against a la carte cable programming, arguing that it would take away from the diversity of programming being offered.  urlLink A couple of weeks ago , I disagreed with the MMTC, and I still do. I don't think there's that much diversity in programming offered, and if there's going to be more diversity  urlLink this is how  it's going to come about. The reason we need a la carte programming is so that consumers get to choose what they pay for -- $50 a month is a ridiculous amount to be paying for a service you don't use $50 a month worth of. I watch NBC, Fox, History Channel, ESPN, CNN, and on occasion ABC, as well as the HBO the cable company didn't turn off when my roommate and I unsubscribed from it. If all my local broadcast stations come with the base price of cable, my NBC, ABC, Fox, CBS and WB affiliates are givens, and if I just want the other 4 stations, why should I also pay for MTV, VH1, The Golf Channel, The Weather Channel, Home Shopping, the Soap Opera Network, Lifetime, FoxNews, MSNBC, and the 65 other stations I don't watch? That's why we need a la carte programming.

       urlLink Get it together . In case you're not sure how it works, this is the deal with the Nielsen ratings system. Every few months, AC Nielsen hands out these little boxes to "random" households. The boxes attach to the TV set, cable box, or satellite receiver (not the dish, the thing on the TV), and record what channel the TV is on when it's being watched. That's why stations pull out all the stops for "sweeps" month -- that's when Nielsen is doing its recording. The problem that has come about is that (surprise!) non-white neighborhoods are often left out of this "random" placing, meaning that shows aimed primarily at non-white audiences -- that is, shows with mainly non-white characters -- often come up with lower ratings than their actual viewership. Which means, of course, that the shows get cancelled sooner, and stations replace shows with a non-white focus with shows with white characters.  If you don't mind an extra e-mail coming to you every day, you should give serious consideration to signing up for  urlLink The Benton Foundation 's communication headlines. It's not focused just on us communications researchers -- the headlines apply to all of us, as consumers of radio, television, telephone services, cable services and Internet services. They also have a couple of other services that are interesting.

      I should say at the outset that I don't think a woman's sexual behavior is anyone's business, nor should it be a reflection on her. That the victim in the Kobe Bryant rape case allegedly had consensual sex with multiple partners around the time of the alleged incident doesn't say to me that she her intercourse with Bryant was consensual. If she says she was raped, I tend to side with her. That said, the  urlLink sexual behavior of a U.S. soldier , being paid with my tax money, abusing prisoners, is not only my business, but the business of all U.S. taxpayers  and  of the people she is abusing. It's the same for male soldiers. Not only is it our business, but the behavior is a reflection on the discipline of the U.S. military, and of the U.S., which our military represents.

      Just read the first paragraph of  urlLink this story :  "An American civilian who was beheaded in a grisly video posted on an al-Qaida-linked Web site had been warned to leave Iraq but refused, U.S. officials said Wednesday. The masked men who butchered him claimed they were angered by coalition abuses of Iraqi prisoners."  When I posted  urlLink this  about the differences between U.K. and U.S. reporting, one thing to look at is how pro-U.S. this paragraph is. First, the AP reporter exonerates the U.S. government by basically printing, "We told him to get out. Did he listen to us? Nooooooo." The reporter then writes that the "masked men... claimed  they were angered" (emphasis added), as though it would be entirely unreasonably for someone -- an Iraqi, no less -- someone fighting for the Iraqi cause against an occupying force, no less -- to be angry at the abuses that have been uncovered. And people complain about "the liberal media," not "the media that panders to the government instead of playing out its watchdog role"?

      As the  urlLink comment  to the  urlLink previous post  notes, pointing to  urlLink this editorial , it is of course possible -- likely, even -- that Pfc. England is a generally good person who did very bad things, in the name of "just taking orders." I feel, though, that I've been pretty good about not blaming only the people who have been photographed -- certainly their commanders are responsible, as are Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and President G.W. Bush. And "following orders" still doesn't play right by me. "It seemed like a good idea at the time and now I regret it" is probably more forgivable.

      The last time I saw  urlLink Seth , he was on Atkins. The bastard. First of all, we were in Massachusetts, and if you have been reading Seth's  urlLink road diary  for the last few years, you know all that we do in Massachusetts is feed Seth beer. I'm sure the specific post I'm referring to is long gone from the archives, but it was funny, and true. But really, that's not the problem. I don't get it. The whole Atkins thing that is. To Seth's credit, he was doing better than  urlLink Dave  and loads better than  urlLink Mike , but really. Let's start at the beginning.  Mike, who used to be my boss -- twice (once on a school newspaper and then again on a weekly) -- and his wife Mary went on Atkins. By day 4, he was having nightmares about bread attacking him. By day 7, he and Mary rushed out to get candy bars -- anything to stop the hallucinations. Dave was better, though I have to say he has a good attitude about pretty much everything. When we wanted to order salads and sandwiches, he would join us for a bacon cheeseburger -- ordered without the bun. And boy did he get cranky after a while. But Seth -- who told me recently he's lost 7 pounds (congrats!) -- sat with us ( urlLink Andrea , Sue and John were also in attendance) at Sylvester's, considering both his homemade sunflower oat toast and his fruit cup. He could have a half slice of toast,  or  he could pick through the fruit cup and pick out the least sweet fruits and have 3 pieces. Come on, people. It's fruit. Sure  urlLink Krispy Kreme's complaining  about the Atkins surge, but that's not really bothering me (though it might bother my dad and  urlLink Lorelei ). What's so wrong about eating less than a cup of cantaloupe and honeydew, along with half of a strawberry? Cripes.  When I lost 30 pounds last year, it was from doing a little bit of balancing on my diet and exercising. I understand that if you eat nothing but carbs all the time, you're probably going to put on some weight, and people are wising up to the fact that being on Atkins doesn't mean you eat nothing but food dripping with fat -- you still have to do some balancing -- but when a diet actually makes people thing that carbohydrate-laden food is  attacking  them, something has to change. I can do it,  urlLink others have done it , you, too, can lose weight without being afraid that the wet noodle is actually going to lash you on its own.

      More on Moore (and Disney). In today's  Times , Michael Eisner writes that  urlLink Disney's intent is not to block the film's distribution  ( urlLink here's the editorial he references ), but to not have Disney subsidiary Miramax distribute the film. The thing is, Miramax had contracted for its distribution.  urlLink Like I said last week , if the company's losing control over its subsidiaries, too bad for the company.  Incidentally, the  Times  editorial mentions that Disney doesn't want to distribute the film because it doesn't want to lose the tax breaks. I'm sorry, I don't feel like Disney needs the tax breaks -- and if they haven't lost them yet because occasionally ABC will have a dissenting voice on the air, they're not going to lose them. This is more about the company backing out on a contract it had already signed.

      My father was always a yeller when us kids were little -- probably something to do with small man syndrome (he's about 5 feet tall and weighs perhaps 110 pounds) -- but he never went into any sort of rage. Which means I don't really have any model to base my reaction to  urlLink this  on. Not only are U.S. troops abusing Iraqi prisoners of war, it's not isolated, as our president has recently said, and  90% of the detainees were mistakenly arrested . Our troops aren't even abusing Iraqi troops -- they grab the proverbial hot dog vendor from his proverbial cart, strip him, put a bag over his head, and send the dogs after him. I don't even know who to slap around anymore.   urlLink Here's an interesting discussion  on journalists' responsibilities to their readers. The article is really a conversation about the differences between American and British journalism styles, but I see good arguments for both sides. While the British press seems to be a lot more critical of its government than the American press of its, there seems to be more of a sensational tendency in the British press. Of course, when I say press, I mean  press  -- I can't speak to British TV news, and I refuse to defend much of American TV news, especially in May, at sweeps time.

      Let me get this straight.  urlLink This guy  -- aged 70 -- is going to spend the rest of his life in jail because the government wants back land that his family has been ranching on  for 100 years ? It's true that the government owns the land, but to leave this guy -- and his 28 cows -- without grazing land and drinking water after they've been using it for a century with the government's permission is robbery. I'd be inclined to suggest he give back the land  if  the government offers to set him and and his cattle up on new land, or the government buys his cattle from him  and  moves him -- with his family -- anywhere they want to go.  And I'd like to thank  urlLink Blogger  -- on the same weekend that I  urlLink finished the new Web page , the company launched a new blog template that is in keeping with a style similar to the rest of the site!  One more thing. Check out punk trio  urlLink The Eyeliners , who just signed with  urlLink Blackheart Records . Good stuff.

      I am shocked,  shocked ...  There are people out there who think commentary is news. John S. Carroll, editor of the Los Angeles  Times ,  urlLink recently warned people about a new breed of journalists  who opine, but their listeners and readers think they are getting news. What was it I wrote last night? Scary. Scary, scary.  And did you catch  urlLink  Weekend Today   (link to show, not story)? Lester Holt embarrased himself by asking Christy Carlson Romano, who voices  urlLink Kim Possible , the title character of a Disney cartoon, and also performs as Belle in Broadway's "Beauty and the Beast," if she was surprised at her success in the Broadway show. She was visibly shocked at the question, and responded with, "Well, I think no woman should underestimate herself...." Holt's problem: He should have asked if Romano was surprised at the show's success, not at her own success.

      Here's an idea: instead of stopping the abuse of prisoners of war, why don't we  urlLink court-martial people who take photos of the abuse  so that we can just stop everybody from  having proof  that we're abusing prisoners of war?

      This is yet  urlLink another danger of using anonymous sources  - reporters from  Time  and NBC News have been subpoenaed. There is not federal shield law, so if the reporters don't give up their sources -- which I expect they won't -- they could go to jail. NBC is  urlLink standing behind Russert , which I think is the way it ought to be;  Time  didn't have anything up front this morning.  What vexes me most about the subpoenas was that there (a) was probably no need to name Valerie Plame in Robert Novak's original article, and (b) Plame was named in a story by  Novak , not one of the reporters who was subpoenaed.

      Indeed,  urlLink John Kerry  is  a douche bag, but I'm voting for him anyway . Actually, I've only had one chance to see the senator in action in person, and I was quite unhappy with his performance. Which is why I voted for Dennis Kucinich in the primary, by the way. Kerry and Congressman John Olver (D-MA) were scheduled to speak to a bunch of Massachusetts seniors about the rising costs of prescription drugs. Olver was to speak for 20 minutes, followed by Kerry for 20 minutes, followed by several senior activists for 20 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of questions for Olver and Kerry.  Olver walked in the door 5 minutes before things were scheduled. 20 minutes later, the seniors started speaking, and 20 minutes after that -- as Olver was starting -- Kerry walked in. Olver wrapped up, Kerry spoke for 45 minutes, explaining to the crowd that he, too, knew what it was like to pay high costs for prescription drugs (note: the people in the crowd were not worth millions of dollars apiece, and most had been in the positiong at some point recently where they had to choose between their drugs and rent or heating oil -- not something Kerry has ever had to worry about). Kerry then took one question and walked out the door.  The thing is, there's no way in heaven, hell, or purgatory I'm willing to let GW back in office, so I'm voting for Kerry over Nader -- and endorsing Kerry over Nader -- against every fiber of my being. OK, almost every fiber of my being.  And, in media news,  urlLink Disney is talking new CEO . Maybe the new person will understand that media companies do have some sort of responsibility to the public. Uh-huh. Yeah, right.

      I have mixed feelings about  urlLink this . Of course education is important -- education for everybody. But before we spend a billion dollars a year on education for the children of the world, I think we need to turn the microscope on the U.S. a bit. When George W. Bush took office, he had this immense plan which took shape in the No Child Left Behind Act. The Act's aim is to make sure that before students move forward in their studies, they have reached what someone has considered a reasonable point along their educational paths. The thing is, many school systems had curricula in place that did not prepare students for the exams used to test the students' progress. Not that the curricula were bad, just different -- which meant that a lot of students were failing the tests.  When school systems saw that their students were failing the tests, they realized that their curricula needed to change to put those curricula in alignment with the exam, and that teachers who had been teaching the otherwise perfectly fine curricula would have to be retrained on the new ones. The recognition that this needed to happen was a big step, but even several years into the act, there remains one big obstacle: the federal government has refused to fund any of the work needed.  If we do start giving $1 billion a year to the world's children, good for us, but we do have to remember to take care of the education of our youth here at home, too. Fund No Child Left Behind.

      Matthew Yglesias makes  urlLink a point about kids coming out OK when they grow up in the city , and  urlLink Amanda makes clear how important it is  that this view be heard. So I am saying so, too. I didn't grow up in a metropolis, but at 190,000 people, Springfield, Mass., was the 2nd biggest city in New England, and sometimes it goes up and down with Providence and Worcester overtaking it.  Everyone  bad-mouthed Springfield public schools. But you know what? Not only did I come out of it just fine -- I spent three years as a  urlLink retail banker  and four years as a  urlLink reporter and editor  before entering one of the  urlLink best communications schools  in the country for grad school (yes, I'm aware it's self-aggrandizing -- read  urlLink this , and note the Web address) -- I'm not the only one doing well. People in my class have gone on to become engineers and teachers, among other careers.

       urlLink This  is not only ridiculous, but bordering on offensive. Some would say it crosses the line into offensive. For a senator who  urlLink posts the national debt on his Web page , helped start the WIC program, and has  urlLink progressive views on media ownership , to blame the U.S. invasion of Iraq on Israel goes beyond naivete and into the land of prejudice revealed. When the elder President Bush invaded Iraq, Israel begged him not to do it -- and when he did, Iraq bombed the heck out of Israel. He can't seriously think we were going into Iraq for Israel's sake. We are in Iraq so that Dubya can finish what his father started. Pure and simple. And it has cost billions of American tax dollars and hundreds of American lives -- all for selfishness. If he wants to defend the family honor, he should be over there fighting.

      They  urlLink just don't get it , do they? In terms of percentage of population, the 1950s were the decade with the highest number of teenage pregnancies. Was it because young people stopped having sex after the '50s? No, it was because we were willing to talk about sex in schools and teach kids about birth control. The same thing goes for AIDS education. If you tell people not to have sex because bad things might happen, the attitude is, "bad things can't happen to me," and they go off and have sex and get AIDS. If you teach people how to have sex safely, they will overwhelmingly respond, as  urlLink Phil Harvey has shown .

      In what way are  urlLink religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and the traditional family  connected? Religious freedom is the right to practice one's religion. The traditional family is the concept of wife-husband-children, which many people choose and many don't. The two are not connected. "The sanctity of human life" is an anti-abortion argument, and yell all you want, but one can be religious and be pro-choice. And remember this, as well: a person who is pro-choice is just that, pro-choice. A person who is pro-choice is not likely to support ending every pregnancy ever. So, let me practice my religion, have whatever family I want, and be pro-choice, if I wish. It's not impinging upon your religious freedom.

      Help me out here.  urlLink I don't get it . So, a perhaps outdated  Webster's Dictionary  definition is what we should rely on?

Nowhere in the Constitution does a child have a right to a mother and a father, and gay rights  is  a civil rights issue: civil rights do not apply to people just because of skin color, they apply to  everyone .  To all of my friends back home and all throughout the Bay State, if you've tied the knot today, I offer you my congratulations.

      What to do? No doubt,  urlLink True Majority  does some good work. I have sent many faxes through them, followed through on many action alerts. So, then, why am I confused as to where they should stand in my heart? If you read the  urlLink Who We Are  page, True Majority bills itself as a "grassroots education and advocacy project." True Majority was founded by Ben Cohen, the Ben half of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, another organization with a  urlLink mission  I appreciate and don't mind supporting as a for-profit ice cream company.  Last week, while working on the Summer Institute on Digital Empowerment ( urlLink Web site  -  urlLink blog ), I called to try to book Ben Cohen to speak about True Majority. He hasn't said no yet, and if he says yes my wavering will certainly tip in favor of sticking with his organization, but first his booking agent tried to sell me both  urlLink Ben  and  Jerry , despite the fact that Jerry doesn't have anything at all to do with True Majority. Then the kicker: the founder of this "grassroots" organization gets  $20,000  a pop to speak to a group. Grassroots my ass. How about rich white guy who can exploit his name to get more money.   Update 1  I forgot to mention, we haven't asked Cohen to speak for free, but we've offered him far less than he brings. He also would not be far and away the most important speaker at our conference -- in fact, he would be about middle of the pack in terms of what he has to offer.   Update 2  As I was walking from my car to school this morning, I did some numbers in my head. Ben Cohen makes $20,000 per speaking appearance, plus travel and hotel. Figuring a $400 plane ticket and $100 for his one-night stay at the Sheraton, he would make $20,500 for an hour's worth of work (45 minutes speaking, plus 15 minutes of questions). Travel time is under 5 minutes, since he has to take the elevator down to the lobby and cross the street (literally) to get to his speaking location. Federal minimum wage is $5.15 per hour. At full time, 40 hours per week, someone making federal minimum wage earns $10,712  a year . In fact, to reach $20,500 in  a year , one has to make $9.86 per hour. If this guy is claiming to run a grassroots organization, he really should not be demanding that kind of money to speak about it.  So,  urlLink what should I do ?

      Please be aware that  urlLink this is not behavior  wished for, nor approved by, all Israelis, or by those of us who would consider ourselves Zionists. If the Israeli military  urlLink razes more homes on the Gaza strip , even in the name of defense, it  must  find homes for those residents who are not combatants -- and remember, not everyone who argues with the military against the destruction of his or her house is a combatant. How would you feel if you were the member of a minority group who, through no fault of your own, had lived for 30 years in a poor but supportive environment, unfortunately in between two warring parties, and one of the parties decided one day it needed your house for its own defense? Wouldn't  you  demand some sort of help relocating?

      I missed  urlLink  Meet the Press  this morning , and such a shame, too: If you also missed it, here's an exchange between Tim Russert and Secretary of State Colin Powell (quoted from NBC News' Meet the Press):  "Russert:  Finally, Mr. Secretary, in February of 2003, you placed your enormous personal credibility before the United Nations and laid out a case against Saddam Hussein citing...  Powell:  Not off.  Emily:  No.  They can't use it.  They're editing it.  They (unintelligible).  Powell:  He's still asking me questions.  Tim.  Emily:  He was not...  Powell:  Tim, I'm sorry, I lost you.  Russert:  I'm right here, Mr. Secretary.  I would hope they would put you back on camera.  I don't know who did that.  Powell:  We really...  Russert:  I think that was one of your staff, Mr. Secretary.  I don't think that's appropriate.  Powell:  Emily, get out of the way.  Emily:  OK.  Powell:  Bring the camera back, please.  I think we're back on, Tim.  Go ahead with your last question.  Russert:  Thank you very much, sir.  In February of 2003, you put your enormous personal reputation on the line before the United Nations and said that you had solid sources for the case against Saddam Hussein.  It now appears that an agent called Curveball had misled the CIA by suggesting that Saddam had trucks and trains that were delivering biological and chemical weapons.  How concerned are you that some of the information you shared with the world is now inaccurate and discredited?"  Emily is a press aide to Powell who was upset by the length of the interview.  urlLink Here's the transcript  as posted on the Department of State Web site.  Kudos, then, to Powell, for sticking with the interview. I always knew there was  one  person in the administration with some integrity (and for the record, I've known all along it was Powell).

       urlLink Curtis Yee  is wondering who I am, what with the two of us being complete strangers and me having a link to his blog over there in the right-hand column. The truth is, I know 7 of the people/organizations whose blogs are linked there, and it's been 8 or 10 years since I've seen one of them (that's probably a lie -- it's more likely 10 or 12). I have this habit of finding interesting blogs (er, blogs that are interesting to  me , which may be different from what is interesting to anyone (or everyone) else. So, if you see a link to your blog on my blog, you've probably said something on your blog that I found interesting at some point.  Of course, I haven't actually answered the question, which is who I am. I'm a grad student at  urlLink Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications , and in my two weeks off, I got pretty gosh darn bored, which is why there are so many posts and I've had all the time to add links to blogs by people I don't even know. Don't worry, though, I start classes again tomorrow, so I won't be posting a dozen times a day anymore -- at least for another month or so.  Now  that's  a long answer to a short question.

      The  urlLink Hotel Syracuse  is a pretty fancy place. When I came to town looking for apartments,  urlLink Andrea  and I stayed there, and thought, upon walking into the lobby, they had quoted us the wrong price. They even have two towers -- we know, because once, when we tried to go up to the room, we wandered into somebody's wedding.  urlLink Lorelei and Mike  did the same.  One thing about  urlLink the closing , though, is that one woman (not quoted in this article) who lives there (5 people make their home their) says she was given 8 days notice, and that she can't move into her new place until mid-June, and that she'll lock herself in her apartment until then, if need be. That can't be healthy, and no one seems to have responded to her (I don't know if the hotel's been given the chance to go on the record), so there's no telling if management is just going to lock her in.  If you've got  urlLink $90 million  just laying around, this is a project worth saving.

      Remember the 2000 presidential campaign? Remember Bush's promise to "leave no child behind?" That's the platform he's running on in 2004: I got No Child Left Behind passed. There's nothing about him doing anything in the coming term if he's re-elected. Read  urlLink his education plan here . What he  has  promised to do, though, is to  urlLink cut education and homeland security  in Fiscal Year 2006. Maybe he should post  that  on his Web site and send it out to his e-mail list.

      If only we could get  urlLink turnouts like this  for federal elections. I am nearly proud to say that in the -- what is it, 3? -- seasons  American Idol  has been on the air, I've managed to watch less than an hour of it total. I am fairly disgusted to find out, though, that the show got 65 million votes last night -- which is  urlLink higher than the turnout  in federal elections between 1962 and 1986 in the years that we weren't electing a president; in 1990, 1994 and 1998, the numbers weren't much higher than that.

       urlLink This is scary , though I do wonder how true it is. I find it somewhat hard to believe that U.S. troops don't have radio access to at least comments by the president and secretary of defense, but on the other hand, Rush-Rush-Rush is not a good programming decision for them. Hopefully they have access to  urlLink this , and those who can't do the thinking for themselves use it once in a while.

      Here we go again.  urlLink There are terrorists in our country, they will attack, but we don't know when, where or how . How can this be useful information for the public? Remember after September 11 an e-mail circulated the Internet telling people not to go to the mall to do their Christmas shopping because terrorists were likely to strike a crowded mall? What happened? Retailers reported rock bottom numbers for the Christmas season, and I doubt that can be entirely blamed on the state of the economy -- yes, were in a recession, but it had really just started. Releasing this information into the public just causes a panic -- if it were better info, people might be watching out.

      In  urlLink  Illusions of Reality  , St. Louis University Psychology Professor  urlLink James Korn  writes that one reason the history of deception research in psychology is interesting is that Americans are used to a certain amount of deception in their everyday lives, and he points specifically to political advertising. When I mentioned this during my presentation on the book,  urlLink Jack  commented that, yes, indeed, at this point, most Americans just assume they're being misled in political ads.  But  urlLink this article  says differently: we're being misled, but average Americans  believe  the deceptions:   "In a survey conducted from April 15 to May 2, 61 percent of the 1,026 voters questioned in the 18 swing states where most of the advertising has run said they believed Mr. Bush favored sending jobs overseas. And 72 percent said they believed that three million jobs had been lost during Mr. Bush's presidency. Mr. Kerry made that claim in a spot in late February, when the most commonly used Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed the actual net job loss to be closer to 2.3 million, down from 2.7 million in late summer. That number is now less than 1.6 million. (Mr. Kerry's figures did not include government jobs.)"   Just curious: are Americans getting dumber? Less educated on the issues? Are we really making important decisions based  only  on television commercials? Doesn't anybody  read  anymore? Or, for that matter, do some of their own thinking?

      Interesting weekend. My baby sister graduated -- from  urlLink college . After my mother laughed through three speeches (former NSF head Rita Colwell, as well as the student trustee and class president), the university managed to send its 1500+ graduates across the stage in 50 minutes.  Coming home, I had a fantastic experience with  urlLink US Airways . I was not at all looking forward to arriving home at midnight at the earliest, but when an earlier, direct flight was delayed, the airline switched my ticket for nothing, and got me home by 10 p.m.  And that's when the thunderstorms hit. We left Hartford just after one, flew around New York City because there was one there, and then as I pulled out of the parking garage at the  urlLink airport , there was lightning. By the time I hit the highway, it was raining so hard that traffic was moving 30. Not long after, it was hailing, and there was a line of cars pulled over on the Interstate, with drivers praying that their windshields stayed intact (mine did). The lightning stopped and started, and stopped and started, and by 3:30 this morning, our power was out. At 7:30  urlLink when I left , the power was still out.  urlLink My roommate , though, said the power was back on between 9 and 11 this morning.  It was nice out for a good bit of today, except for the time I went to the  urlLink grocery store , and had to walk back to my car in a ridiculous downpour. Oh, the life of  urlLink Josh .

      Here we go, running commentary on the president's talk. br>First of all, I want to note that the networks have declined to cover this. That means that only people who (a) have cable/satellite and (br) know where to find it can watch this. Shame on the networks.  "The actions of our enemies over the last few weeks have been brutal..." -- but our actions haven't been brutal?  Rules of warfare, bounds of civilized behavior? Eh? Eh? Come on. What we're doing at Abu Ghraib is civilized, and within the bounds of the Geneva Conventions. Nope.  The rise of a free Iraq will lead to no home for terrorists? After 9/11, didn't we find dozens of sleeper cells here  inside  the U.S.?  Bush seems surprised that Saddam Hussein's former foot soldiers have found new ways to combat the U.S. after Hussein's capture. Uh, duh, we didn't think Iraqis were that smart. Puh-lease.  "No power of the enemy will stop Iraq's progress." Pause, hope for applause.  "Our agenda is freedom, independence..." under a foreign flag. The Iraqis can be free and independent, and we'll occupy the land and make sure they're independent.  "12 government ministries are under direct control of Iraqis," who are under direct control of Americans, right?  Just because we don't hold the government posts doesn't mean we're not occupying the government. If France's military was all over the U.S., but Bush was left in charge, doesn't mean France isn't occupying us. Come on, W., we're not stupid, and neither are Iraqis.  We're going to leave 138,000 armed troops in Iraq as long as we have to, and if we need to send more troops, we will -- doesn't sound like we're relinquishing much, even if Iraqis are titular heads of state. If our military would leave, enemy troops would have no more targets. I'd even be OK if we left some civilians to do  good  work -- and I mean good in my interpretation.  Uh, oh. We're training the Iraqi military. Like we did for Osama bin Laden, I suppose?  Oh, so Iraq gets control of the government, but not the military. I see. The can make laws, but not defend themselves. And I'm sure if we want to attack another country from Iraq, they'd be happy to lend us the land, what with us having the guns and all.  Wow. We're building maximum security prisons -- why, so we can be trusted with them? And what's this, Abu Ga-who? Garum? OK. We know what you meant.  Free national elections. Orderly, accurate elections. Wow. Does anybody else remember election day, 2000?  "Iraq eill elect a permanent government by the end of next year." Isn't a permanent government a dictatorship? Or a monarchy? We have a permanent  structure  for our government -- the three branches, two houses in the legislative branch, etc. -- but we elect new people to our government every two years (House and 1/3 of the Senate). Castro, on the other hand, heads a permanent government.  The nightmare of the Taliban is over? I doubt it. Al Qaeda and the Taliban supported one another, and we  know  Al Qaeda is still around -- can the Taliban be far behind?   urlLink This  isn't the full transcript, but it gets to the heart of what the President said tonight.   urlLink Here's  a story from MSNBC filed during the speech.   In sum , I don't think we learned anything new, and the President, as usual, came off sounding like an ass. Or a major league asshole, for that matter.

      Well, Ronald Reagan went from, "It could be weeks; it could be months," to  urlLink dead  in about an hour (I can't find the old stories any more). I wonder if he's the only actor who has ever had an airport named after him. In all seriousness, though, heartfelt wishes to his family.

      Take  urlLink this survey  (which I found via  urlLink Matthew Yglesias ). Here are my answers:  1. True with a big big qualifier, which makes me answer False. Gasoline prices are enormously higher in other parts of the world than they are in the U.S. However, in the U.S., we have more reliance on gasoline -- and not just because people with SUVs swallow so much gas. People here commute. The nation's economy is built around people needing gasoline. If gas prices shoot through the roof  now , the economy is going to be hurting. People won't be able to get to work, or alternately, would need huge raises companies wouldn't put out. Before we consider leaving gas prices high, we need to build a better public transportation infrastrucure, and a better national train or airplane system. Neither system right now is convenient or inexpensive enough to be an alternative.  2. b 3. True; we're not the only ones here. 4. False. And I've  worked  at it. 5. Frankly, I don't give a damn. 6. e. As a non-Christian, I have seen too much in-fighting among a variety of groups who each claim to be Christian. From where I stand outside the circle, there needs to be more inter-group dialogue. 7. True. I live here, too. 8. False -- and I consider myself much more informed than many people. I believe our government is very tight with information. 9. a 10. False. But it  is  important to  understand  mainstream culture and its implications in your life and the lives of others. 11. False. I don't classify myself as an environmentalist, but I can see arguments for me to treat the environment better than I do. 12. False. It requires work, and it's not  easy , but there are more difficult things to do besides living. 13. False. I see too much wrong with the world around me to love everything in life. I like life, I enjoy it, I want to make it better, but no, I don't love it in its current state. 14. True. I'm a numbers man, and that's what the numbers say. 15. True. Why is this even a question? 16. True. It can be either a moral or non-moral judgment about what is "good" from either an objective or subjective sense. We might not like the term; we could use the word "windmill" instead, but it's one word we've chosen to use as a value judgment. 17. True. Again, I'm a numbers man, and that's what the numbers say. 18. True. 19. True. It describes something. So does the word "blue." 20. True. And I do. 21. False. But I like being the former better. 22. False. If you can't be passionate about something, you shouldn't be pushing one side or the other. 23. False. 24. True. 25. True. All people who wish the support of a movement should have one. If some feel their movements should be countered, there should be counter-movements, too. All movements should be non-violent, and I won't join an exclusionary one. 26. False, though I think for a long time it had turned into a pejorative term. 27. False. I think this might have been true 5 or 6 years ago when I was waking up to some of the problems in the world, but those movements that have previously excluded heterosexual white men are now embracing them when they, too, are willing to stand up for a cause. 28. In a medical or scientific sense, false. In the sense that one should be aware of who they are and how they and others view the world, true. 29a. a. 29b. e. 30. True. Trying my best to fill my niche. 31. True. And finding it as often as I can.

      All other things aside,  urlLink Wyclef Jean is both  a fantastic writer and a stand-up guy -- at least from everything I've heard or read about him. No, he's not a great singer, musician, or rapper, but he does all three  on his own  -- that is, he plays guitar, he plays keys, he does his own vocal work, and he writes his own stuff. I'm guessing he engineers and produces as much of it as he can, too. And he's a heck of a writer. That's all I have to say about that.

      While the Bush administration is peddling abstinence only here in the U.S. (which is clearly an effective method for curbing sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy -- if it were an effective method for getting people to stop having sex), the folks in Sweden are  urlLink getting it right : if you're unexpectedly about to have sex and there's no condoms about, dial 696969 and a white van sporting a logo that is a condom with wings shows up and sells you a 10-pack of condoms for the equivalent of US$6.72.

      From  urlLink No Capital  comes  urlLink this story  blaming the Abu Ghraib prison abuse on pornography. See, apparently, liberals not only support but  create  pornography, and so it's not surprising that the people in charge of the prisoners needed pornography, so they had to abuse the prisoners so that they could take obscene photos. Yes! It's all pornography's fault! Frank Rich joins what I hope is a majority in   urlLink thinking that's just ridiculous .

      I just listened to a few songs from, and then downloaded, the  urlLink Freakshow.com 10-Year Anniversary Compilation . These folks say they have plenty of money and that art should be free, so they post music for free download.  I'm up in the air on this art-should-be-free thing. There are several  urlLink free mp3s  on my Web site, but in theory, it costs a bunch of money to record music. Personally, I was lucky and got free studio time, so all I've paid for is a couple of beers, a couple of cups of coffee, and some blank CDs. But if I had dropped $2,000 on the studio time, then $800 on mastering (my CD hasn't been mastered), and $1,200 on pressing and nice printing, I think selling most of the CDs would be a good way to make up that $4,000.  Of course, there's plenty of quality music out there that hasn't been mastered, beautifully pressed, and beautifully printed, and I commend artists who do this just because they want to get the music out there. In fact, I also greatly appreciate them, and tend to support them more than I support others. I was a music reviewer for 4 years, I've booked independent artist showcases, and when I work with artists on bios, Web sites, press kits or just plain old advice, I'm not on board if they're goal is to be with a major label. Indie label, fine, but I'm not big on the record industry as practiced by major labels.  In the spirit of this post, please check out some independent artists, including some who have started labels so that they didn't have to deal with the major labels:  urlLink Seth Horan ,  urlLink James O'Brien ,  urlLink Emily Shore ,  urlLink Joan Jett ,  urlLink Michael Franti ,  urlLink Ember Swift .

      I've been fascinated by my nearly two months blogging. It's amazing just how many people read, what people write about -- and how willing bloggers seem to be to open up to the world. Less than a week ago, Jesse posted a  urlLink touching tribute  to his late grandfather, and now Matt gives us  urlLink reason to pause  and pray for his family. It seems there really are no rules of engagement here, that there's nothing to say what is appropriate to post and not to post (other than the obvious illegal content), and so I find it amazing that people are willing to be so open online in front of strangers -- especially those whose writings tend to lean toward the political and the media-related, as opposed to live journals and such.

      Maybe it's Don't Speak Ill of the Dead Syndrome, but Salon's pretty adamant in pointing out that most media outlets, particularly television ones, are " urlLink uniformly worshipping " Ronald Reagan. And the online magazine is right. I was 14 when the elder Bush took office, which means that I wasn't quite old enough to understand the implications of Reagan's presidency while it was happening, but I certainly remember the Iran-Contra Affair and questioning what our then-president had done in terms of his foreign policy -- though again, I certainly didn't understand most of what I knew.  Actually, I don't really know where I'm going with this; perhaps I'm just exploring Reagan's presidency on the date of his state funeral. Yeah, that's it.

I can't seen to get the  urlLink Dallas Police Department Web site  to load, but  urlLink this story  says the department is posting pictures of  alleged  johns. If they've not been convicted, couldn't there be some trouble here? There is a presumption of guilt when a picture goes up on the Web site, and that may taint a jury, and may be serious trouble for the DPD if it turns out the people in the pictures  aren't  guilty.  Here's a  urlLink story from Slate  offering corrections of myths about Reagan:  "(1) Reagan, the "Great Communicator," owed his success mainly to his facility with television and public relations; (2) Reagan was a uniter, not a divider; (3) Reagan was an incorrigible optimist; (4) Reagan restored faith in government and the presidency; (5) Reagan's get-tough policy with the Soviet Union brought about the end of the Cold War."   And finally,  urlLink John Kerry has decried media consolidation , at least for now.

      Here's a  urlLink new report  on world military spending. Of the $956 billion spent on defense in 2003:  1. United States, $449.32 billion 2. Japan, $47.8 billion 3. Canada, $38.24 billion &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Great Britain (tie) &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;France (tie)  That's right: the U.S. spent  9.4 times  more than the next highest spender.

      Remember when  urlLink Matt Drudge  "broke a story" about John Kerry's supposed affair with intern Alex Polier? If not, here's a reminder: Kerry was supposed to have a Lewinsky-type scandal. (Search the Drudge Report Archives for  urlLink Kerry intern  and for  urlLink Polier .) Polier has finally responded in an article in  urlLink  New York Magazine  . Here, also, are  urlLink links to other stories  about the whole Kerry/Polier thing. It took guts -- I'm glad she came forward with her story.

      What happened to  urlLink this guy  is just awful. Every employer knows that you can't run a good company without happy workers. If your workers are made physically ill by the work, have emotional breakdowns from the work, and even sometimes hallucinate from what they've seen on the job, shouldn't you take care of those workers? Really -- if other people rely on this guy to act as part of a team, they could  die  if he's not in great shape. It's one thing to work our troops hard; it's another to pretend they're not human and don't have human needs that sometimes need taking care of before thay can be truly well enough to work.

      The  urlLink  Times   says $1.75 millions and the  urlLink  Post   says $2 million, but whatever it is, Clear Channel Communications will be paying throught he nose in indecency fines. These fines stem not just from the incident that got Howard Stern booted from CCC airwaves, but also reportedly from complaints filed with the FCC that haven't been read yet. There are no comments yet on the  urlLink FCC  or  urlLink Clear Channel  Web sites, nor on  urlLink Clear Channel Sucks . For as much as I despise CCC, I wonder what sort of implications this has for small independent broadcasters, who won't be able to handle a fine as large as, say, $275,000 an utterance.  The FCC really needs to make its decency rules more clear, and structure a fine system based on market size, type of broadcast outlet, strength of frequency, etc. Right now, the rules state that broadcasters (over-the-air broadcasters; this doesn't apply to cable or satellite) cannot graphically describe sexual situations or excretory functions between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. While it might sound like that's a good rule, it doesn't define what "graphically," "sexual situations" or "excretory functions," so even a flat-sounding report on the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky thing could theoretically have fallen into the realm of indecency. Yup, time for new rules.

      Here's an interesting new  urlLink media use report  done by the Pew Center for People and the Press. It seems more people are getting their news online -- nearly 30% read news on the web at least three times a week -- and Republicans  really  don't trust the media: less than 30% think Fox News is credible, and that's the highest of all the channels. It's also the only news outlet more Rebublicans than Democrats (24%) believe to be credible.

      I'm cheap, but I'm not putting people out of business.  urlLink This, however, might  (link from  urlLink silversand ). $50/year for people or small businesses to have a Web presence. The scary thing: it's what people want.  When one member of an organization found out the marketing firm that organization had hired agreed to pay me $750 plus hosting for a small site that had to be up for about two months with no other updates during the year, she was appalled. She thought her brother should have been paid $150 to do the site, which he could do in 3 hours (if you do Web design, you know that sure, a simple site might be designed in 3 hours, but it won't have any content, no suggestions from the company that hired you, etc.).  The organization this woman works for is a non-profit, which had hired a non-profit marketing firm -- a firm I've had a good professional relationship with for two years now. The project went out to bid; I submitted for $1,500; the other bids ranged between $3,500 and $6,000. The marketing firm applied for a grant, and the amount of money came in much lower than the bids, so I agreed to take a pay cut if I didn't have to do meetings and I could take a full two business days after I was notified of updates to make the changes. I thought that was reasonable; so did the marketing firm.  I don't feel like I'm out here low-balling offers, ripping away business (what with me doing maybe 2 or 3 sites a year, tops), but if people can get canned sites for not very much money -- $5/month or $50/year -- it might not be too long before people who are good at the whole Web design thing are flipping burgers. Whitespace  urlLink has some suggestions , but I'm not convinced that businesses that would otherwise not be on the Web would hire out at even modest rates to set themselves apart.  Well, that turned out to be more of a rant than I had imagined. Just one more reason to  urlLink boycott Wal-Mart , I guess.

      Well, I saw the  urlLink new  Harry Potter  film  on Friday night. I left the cineplex feeling unfulfilled. After talking it over with  urlLink Andrea , it turns out this is mostly because I haven't read the book. I read the first book, didn't love it; saw the first movie, kind of liked it; didn't read any more books; saw the second movie, enjoyed it very much. The thing with this third film is that it's missing a lot of set up and depth. The two parts of this movie that are by far the most important take up very little time (especially considering the running time was 139 minutes), and happen rather suddenly, without us really understanding what is happening until we have a chance to reflect on it.  The film is also much darker than the first two, something which may be attributable to the direction of Alfonso Cuar&#243;n, who may best be known for a gratuitous underwater ejaculation scene in  Y Tu Mama Tambien  (Chris Columbus directed the first two). Michael Newell is directing the fourth film, scheduled for release next year. A director has not been named yet for the fifth film, due out in 2007.  urlLink Michael Gambon , who is 10 years younger than the late Richard Harris and who looks considerably younger, brings a new energy to Albus Dumbledore we are not used to seeing.  I guess if I'm going to catch up, I'm going to have to spend the second half of the summer reading the second and third books.

      Well, it appears I will be ending a nearly three-year old boycott. The last show I saw at the  urlLink Iron Horse  was  urlLink Michael Franti  in November of 2001. I had been regularly disappointed by the Horse's high prices, mediocre service, and the painfully haughty monopoly attitude of being the only place in town for a show that seated more than 50 and less than 5,000. The owner also runs 2 other venues into, books into still 2 more in the area, and then has booking operations at other places. It always kind of felt like, "You don't like it? Fne. Don't come. You can't get this stuff anywhere else."  But today I got news that they hired  urlLink Christen Greene and Faux Pas Productions  to run their street team. They have been better about booking local artists -- something Christen may be partly responsible for with the great turnouts from  urlLink Chris Pureka's  performances there. Congrats, Christen. I'll see you out there. [If you want to pass along your congrats, click  urlLink here .]

      I just saw the trailer for a new movie called  urlLink  Two Brothers  . The trailer showed a young boy sleeping peacefully with his newly adopted pet -- a tiger cub found in the woods. Common sense should dictate that this is a movie, and it appears that in the movie, the tiger cub is returned to the wild. It strikes me, though, that there is danger inherent in this film -- suddenly, are children going to start wanting pet tigers? And are there some parents, in their blind love for their children, going to comply with their children's wishes? If so many people try the stunts from  Jackass , and parents are willing to get involved in fistfights over their children's youth sports games, isn't this just asking for disaster?

      Via the first post at  urlLink RiverbendBlog in over 2 weeks  comes a web site featuring  urlLink a database of Iraqi civilians killed  during the U.S.-led war on terror.

      There are some news sources that will directly quote colorful language. But I feel that to include words you can't say on broadcast television  casually  in a news report really detracts from the credibility even of a pretty solid news source. Note  Slate's   urlLink casual use of the term FUBAR  in its reporting today. If you know it's an acronym for  F ucked  U p  B eyond  A ll  R ecognition, then you know you've read a casual use of the word fuck in your daily news reading. If you don't know the nature of the word FUBAR, you're probably just staring at the screen wondering why it's not in your dictionary. I'm all for casual cussing in daily life; just not in my news.

Will the Americans who are electrically shocked and sleep-deprived be National Guard from Vermont or Florida?   Should our government and military be acting differently? Yes. Should it be in Jesus' name? No. Is this a little overboard? Maybe:   The pictures to come of naked, hooded Americans with wires attached...who will they be?

Of course, we knew the world has been upset with us for holding people at Guantanamo Bay and for the abuses at Abu Ghraib, but the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is the only independent group allowed to see prisoners of war, says that if the U.S.  urlLink doesn't release Saddam Hussein  when we hand control over to the new Iraqi government, we will be in violation of international law, unless we charge him -- and apparently, we  urlLink don't actually have any evidence  against him, at least according to Drudge, if we can trust him after the whole  urlLink Kerry-Polier  flap he blew.

      In case there was any doubt that Afghan President Hamid Karzai is a U.S. puppet, take a look at this quote from today's edition of  urlLink NBC News' Meet the Press :   "Without the presence of the United States forces in Afghanistan, without the presence of the international community in Afghanistan, without the presence of the ISAF in Afghanistan, Afghanistan will not be in good shape.  That is why the Afghan people keep asking for more of the International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan.  That is why the Afghan people are asking for the deployment of NATO coalitions.  That's why the Afghan people have embraced the arrival of the United States of America in Afghanistan for its liberation, because they know that we need international assistance in order to build our institutions over time, in order to build a national army, in order to build a national police."

      There are  urlLink two great stories here . One is of the trip Ecuadorian migrants make sailing from Ecuador to Guatemala, being smuggled into Mexico, being held hostage for more money, and then making it across the Mexican border into Arizona and eventually Los Angeles, from where they disburse. The other is of Sandra Ochoa, a reporter for a newspaper in Ecuador, who teamed up with New York  Times  reporter Ginger Thompson.  Thompson initially tried to get herself smuggled, but the smugglers wouldn't bite. So, she enlisted Ochoa, who likely could have just hopped a plane to the U.S., but instead takes the trip. She is bailed out by her newspaper at one time, who sent an extra $500 to the smugglers, and is more or less  caught  by the boat captain, who finds out she knows Thomspon -- who he knows to be a  Times  reporter. If you've got the time, it's a brilliant read, and knowing what Ochoa went through without having to, I'd feel guilty  not  reading it.

      Via  urlLink better.shorter  comes  urlLink a big ethical issue in blogging . I think people have covered fair use and copyright law fairly well in the comments, though I would have to say that 25% of an article seems like a lot -- part of fair use law is the substantiality of what is used; that is, if you give the punchline in the 10 words you quote, you might be infringing on a copyright ( if  it detracts money awat from the copyright holder or brings money to the infringer).

      Sarah Whalen predicts that we are now  urlLink facing World War III , which will have a different ending than previous recent wars: rather than running out of people, weapons or cash, someone (likely the U.S.) will run out of intelligence. I don't know that I agree; I think that if it comes down to it, the U.S. can simple overpower people. On the other hand, Whalen does offer some fantastic hindsight on the September 11, 2001 hijackings. Too bad it's hindsight and she wasn't flying one of the planes.

      Finally, I have found what I think might be an  urlLink honest review of  Fahrenheit 9/11  . David Edelstein is a bit conflicted about the film, appreciating the message but being rattled by Moore's unrelenting methods. I guess I'll stop writing about the movie until I see it. Yeah, that's it. Hopefully, tomorrow.

      Senate President and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney says his use of the word "fuck" during a would-have-been exchange of pleasantries with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy was justified because, well, it just  urlLink needed to be said . What this comes down to, though, is a lack of civility among executive branch Republicans. This started back in 1999 when then-candidate George W. Bush  urlLink repeatedly said "fuck"  in a 1999 interview with  Talk  magazine, and then later called New York  Times  reporter Adam Clymer a "major league asshole" on microphone. I repeat what I said after the Clymer incident: I'm afraid that Bush or Cheney is going to say something like that to an antagonistic world leader at some point, and the bombs are going to start flying.

      Matt Yglesias points out that  urlLink trashing Michael Moore increases  the amount of money going to left-wing causes, and probably also increases the number of Moore imitators. We've heard a lot about the "polarization" of the country lately, but I feel that applies mainly to Hollywood of late. Voters are increasingly the same, they just hate the little things in someone else's candidate -- the candidates are polarized, not the voters. On the other hand, there are people who  hate  people like Moore, and trash him in print, which makes more people go to see his movies. I happen to be one of those people who sees Moore's films, and I tend to like the message, but not the method. The trailers I've seen for  Fahrenheit 9/11  reaffirm that, and I plan to see the film tomorrow night, if I can corral some tickets.  The same kind of "polarization" effect happened recently with Mel Gibson's film  The Passion of the Christ . The film would have had a built-in audience that would have been big, but not huge. However, with people saying the film was too violent or anti-Semitic, people who would  not  have seen the film did. I didn't manage to see it thanks to a busy schedule, but darned if I wouldn't have been in the second group -- I had no real interest in the movie, but when Jewish leaders decried it as anti-Semitic, I felt that if I wanted to chime in on that point (and I did want to, since these people claim to represent me), I had to go see the movie.

      Readers of the  Baltimore Sun  will be suffering losses in coverage, thanks to  urlLink buyouts of staff contracts and a 4% reduction in news hole . This comes after  urlLink memos to the newsrooms  of various Tribune Company publications saying that since advertising is down company wide, there will be cuts to the newsroom (it is unclear if there will be cuts to advertising staff). If there is a sudden increase in advertising revenue, though -- as the company is hoping there will be -- that will mean more space for less staff to fill, which means more wire copy, bigger photos and other items to replace local news, because the  Sun  is unlikely to quickly fill those reporter spots.

      According to the  Chronicle , new posters spoofing the Got Milk? and iPod ads are popping up in San Francisco, wondering  urlLink  if Iraqis "Got Democracy?" . I'm not really sure what message the posters are trying to get across -- clearly, they're not making Iraqis think about their incoming government, because posters are being placed in San Francisco. It seems that if the creators are looking to stir an anti-war sentiment, they're pretty much preaching to the choir, as San Francisco is known as one of the most liberal cities in the country, and was the site of some of the biggest anti-war protests in the country. Why wouldn't the creators try to get some of these posters to other markets that might not be as simply generally accepting of them?

      GOPers in Oregon are worried. It seems they can't get enough people to come out and vote for George W. Bush, so they're hoping they can get their voters out to  urlLink get Ralph Nader on the ballot , so that liberals will vote for him instead of John Kerry. I think, though, there are quite a few of us who voted for Nader the last time out who will be voting for Kerry this time around, in the hopes that the Supreme Court won't be appointing the president again. A new  USA Today /CNN/Gallup Poll has Bush leading Kerry  urlLink by one percentage point , with a 5% margin of error. In the swing states, though, Kerry is way up, 53%-40%, with a lower margin of error.

      This is a case of just trying to stay in the news, I think. Lions Gate Film  urlLink may not be able to advertise the movie  Fahrenheit 9/11   after July 30, because the Federal Elections Commission would consider it campaign advertising. Under McCain-Feingold, corporations are not allowed to sponsor political ads within 30 days of a national primary, which the FEC considers the Republican National Convention to be. Most movies, though, aren't still advertising six weeks after their national release -- so is this just a case of Lions Gate trying to generate  more  free publicity about the film?

      It's clear that the title of Michael Moore's film  Fahrenheit 9/11  was ripped straight off of Ray Bradbury's most famous novel,  Fahrenheit 451 . Nobody's disputing that. But Bradbury  urlLink wants his title back , arguing that Moore never asked permission.  Well, too bad. Titles can't be copyrighted, and even if Bradbury could have copyrighted his title, it was for a book, not a movie. Beyond that, I think Bradbury has had fair warning. To bring this forward less than a week before the film's release, when it's been in the headlines for a couple of months already, is just asking to be ignored.

      Not that I support Clear Channel at all, but I hope the company  urlLink counter-sues Infinity Broadcasting  for the amount of the fines the company had to pay, and for whatever it cost them to replace Howard Stern. Infinity's suing for breach of contract for Clear Channel's yanking of Stern after the FCC cited the company for Indecency Act violations.

      I believe it was Kevin Spacey playing Roger "Verbal" Kint in the movie  The Usual Suspects  who said, "How do you shoot the devil in the back? What if you miss?" The answer to those questions, of course, is, "Don't miss."  urlLink Well, someone missed  the wrong guy.

      First off, the  urlLink poll numbers here  add up to 110%: 87% say they eat healthy meals half the time, 11% most of the time, and 12% rarely. Despite that seemingly high number of people who eat healthy regularly, nearly 60% of people say they are overweight.  But this article never gets around to what overweight is. I wonder how many of these people actually  are  overweight, versus how many perceive they are overweight. Studies have shown that -- especially amoung young women -- media images offer warped perceptions of self-image. Someone who thinks she's overweight because she's barraged with pictures of the Olsen twins, Britney Spears, Nicole Kidman and Halle Berry (among others) may really be on the thin side of average, but appear overweight compared to those images.

      This will be interesting.  urlLink Howard Dean will debate Ralph Nader  on the subject of whether Nader should run for president. The debate happens July 9, and hopefully someone will carry the event live. Of course, I'm sure Nader will stay in the race. One of the reasons he should stay in is that hundreds (thousands?) of volunteers have signed up and put lots of energy into his campaign. Another reason he should stay in is that...umm, well, so there's one reason he should stay in.

      I love this time year. You know, when the  urlLink Red Sox play the Yankees . Walking around campus today, a woman shouted to me and gave me a thumbs-up from her van, and pointed to her head, signalling her approval of my Red Sox cap. Meanwhile, on the way back to my car, some redneck leaning out the window of his pickup truck yelled "Boston sucks!" at me. An innocent passerby chuckled. And it was nice to watch Johnny Damon hit a lead-off home run.

      Daniel Pink at  Wired  writes about the  urlLink Big Brother-Little Brother reversal  offered by digital technology, citing the wide distribution of photos of abuse at Abu Ghraib. I don't know, though. Sure, digital technology has allowed "normal" people to reach the world, but I don't feel there's a reversal going on -- the same technology is helping the government carry out surveillance on "normal" people. What's worse, the government is using the "normal" person's ability to reach the world to pass laws restricting freedoms.

      So, I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11 . Michael Moore is growing as a filmmaker, documentarian, and yes, I'll say it, propagandist. I feel I am pretty on top of things, and the only new information I gleaned from the movie was Britney Spears' support for the president. Others I've spoken to, though -- even those I would consider to be on top of things -- say they learned from the film, which is good.  Other than the 2-minute interlude in  Bowling for Columbine , I feel to date Moore's films have been low on direction and production value. Not so with  F911 . His use of non-image toward the beginning of the film is surprising brilliant. He clearly put more time and work into this movie than previous ones, and he certainly benefitted from the availability of staff -- it was obvious that he had other people to do some filming and searching through archives.  Moore has learned from previous criticism to tone down the obnoxious stunts, and he has mostly kept his face out of this film, except when it actually makes sense for him to be in it. In the past, I have appreciated the message Moore has tried to get across, but he typically goes far enough in his stunts that I wouldn't want him to be a spokesperson for my views. In  Bowling , when he and a shooting victim walked into K-Mart to "return the bullets" in the victim's back, all he did was manage to fluster a young, underpaid salesperson he knew would not be able to help him. This time, he takes his complaints straight to congresspeople, who actually can be responsible for the things he is asking for.  Moore also gets his point across much better than he has in the past. His use of repeating images, score and soundtrack is really good. I'd love  urlLink to hear from you  on this to see what you thought.

      Apologies, but due to the  urlLink Summer Institute on Digital Empowerment , light on the posts today, tomorrow and Friday -- but updates on the Institute will come over the weekend.  But, at least I'll put this one up. The new "Save the Rainforest" movement in Norway involves young people (teens, 20s)  urlLink having sex in public to divert money from commercial porn  and put it toward rainforest preservation. The last time these two had sex in public, they raised almost US$15,000 to donate to the cause -- but the intended recipient didn't want the donation because of the way in which the money was raised.

      This year, the party conventions will  urlLink allow bloggers to cover the goings-on  as journalists.

Kerry had announced he wanted to break the story to his e-mail list -- I got the e-mail at 8:56 a.m. EDT, a full 4 minutes before he was scheduled to announce it to everyone else. I do think this was the right choice.

      It's no secret that I'm not a fan of the Atkins Diet. But I  am  a supporter of tort reform. If a person or business is at fault somewhere, they should certainly pay. Before the death of Carol Rubick (and Dr. Atkins), Rubick sued Atkins' company for basically  urlLink providing lousy health care . She went to his organization against doctor's orders, and continued going for five years before her death. The suit continues today between her estate and Atkins' company. I think if Rubick was concerned enough about the level of care she was getting to sue the organization, she should have taken a little responsibility in her treatment.

      Let me get this straight: We invaded Iraq, occupied the country against the will of the people, installed a puppet government, and now we're  urlLink making Iraqis pay for the reconstruction of their country . Of the over $18 billion of taxpayer money Congress agreed to spend to rebuild Iraq, we've spent a little under $400 million. Meanwhile, security is suffering (we've spent less than $200 million of the $3.4 billion we said we'd spend on security). We've created 15,000 jobs when by June 30 we were to have created 250,000 (that's 7% of our promise). I'm angry enough that we have to spend this money for a war we never should have been in, but dammit, let's actually  make things better  now.

      Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, recently told The Commonwealth Club that  urlLink not enough people are holding elected officials accountable  for their actions while in office. He said that basically, every two or four years (he didn't say it, but it would be 6 years in the case of senators), officials come back to their bosses for review, and if GM ran their business that way, "we'd still be driving horses and buggies." This is something Lynette Guastaferro of  urlLink Teaching Matters  brought up during the  urlLink Summer Institute on Digital Empowerment  last week, asking how many people had written their elected officials in the last year, and also more than once. She went on to say that elected officials tend to put more stock in paper correspondence -- that is, mail that comes via post -- than they do in e-mail, but with a lot of screening going on in government buildings due to the appearance of anthrax in the mail more than two years ago, postal correspondence can take 6 weeks or longer to get to elected officials. So with almost literally no oversight of officials, how are they to know what the majority of their constituents think of them, anyway?

      In light of the fact that tobacco companies have ever-stricter regulations on their advertising, and the fact that ever-fewer people are killing themselves by smoking, the government is  urlLink promising tobacco growers $12 billion  to help make sure they can survive -- on producing a crop that fewer and fewer people want. It seems farmers could better use those subsidies to make their fields suitable to  different  crops, rather than to fill in their income gaps while their tobacco sales drop.

      This is just plain old,  urlLink self-congratulatory hogwash . Melting down statues of Saddam Hussein? Sure. Having an Iraqi artist do something with them? Sure.

      Matt Yglesias thinks  urlLink John Ashcroft  shouldn't  resign  (in response to an  urlLink Alliance for Justice campaign  to ask the attorney general to step down). I think it'd be better to just, umm,  distract  Ashcroft. You've probably  urlLink heard him sing  (his performance of "Let the Eagle Soar" was also reprised in the film  Fahrenheit 9/11 ). In light of that, I teamed up with my friends at  urlLink P.A.C.E.  to get him out performing. We offered him "an evening of patriotic music," which of course would be songs of dissent sung by political folkies (an evening we are more than happy to plan if he accepts).  First, here's the cover letter to the press:  Pioneer Arts Center of Easthampton 41 Union St. Easthampton, MA 01027  Greetings!  After watching archival footage of U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft sing his original song “Let the Eagle Soar” in Michael Moore’s documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, we at the Pioneer Arts Center of Easthampton (P.A.C.E.) thought that rather than prosecuting Americans for trying to get through airport metal detectors with steel hip replacements or prosecuting immigrants with student visas for having Arab-sounding names, he could better serve his country by going on tour to promote his patriotic music.  In the spirit of launching that tour – and distracting the attorney general from abusing the Patriot Act – we have invited Mr. Ashcroft to headline a night of patriotic music at our non-profit theater. Enclosed is a copy of the letter we have sent to his office. We are happy to talk about the invitation. Call us any time at (413) 527-3700.  Yours,  Sonia Oppenheim Pioneer Arts Center of Easthampton  And here's the letter we sent to Ashcroft's office (if you book a venue, feel free to steal from it to get him on tour):  Pioneer Arts Center of Easthampton 41 Union St. Easthampton, MA 01027  2 July 2004  U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft U.S. Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20530-0001  Dear Mr. Attorney General,  As the Independence Day holiday approaches, we in the talent buying department of the Pioneer Arts Center of Easthampton find ourselves moved by the spirit of the holiday. Since the opening of our non-profit performing arts venue nearly two years ago, we have planned musical tribute nights and theme nights, and the idea came to us: how about a night of patriotic music?  It is, of course, too late for us to find talent and promote the show in time for July 4. But this is America, and any time is a good time to celebrate the freedoms we’re afforded by living in this great country. We typically book shows three months in advance, so early September seems like a good time for such an evening.  We have followed your career since you were a member of The Singing Senators with your former colleagues Mssrs. Jeffords, Craig and Lott, and your performance of “Let the Eagle Soar” has found renewed vigor in the coming of Independence Day.  We would like to invite you to join some of Western Massachusetts’ finest musicians in an evening of patriotic music on Thursday, September 16, 2004, at our 96-seat theater in the shadow of Mount Tom in scenic Easthampton, Mass. We tend to start our shows at 8 p.m., but would certainly be flexible to your schedule on that day. We would also be willing to change the date, but as of now, we know we have that date open on our calendar.  We think this would be an excellent way to connect with American citizens at the same time as honoring our country. Thank you, and may God bless America.  Yours,  Sonia Oppenheim	Ethan Baird	Joshua Shear The Talent Buying Department, Pioneer Arts Center of Easthampton

      Here's another post from  urlLink Bonnie  about the conference:    reflections on this conference .. one section  2004 Summer Institute on Digital Empowerment: "The Internet & Democracy"  July 8 - 9, 2004  The Center for Digital Literacy (CDL) at Syracuse University  worked with Professors Larry Elin and Steve Davis of the Newhouse School and Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell School to present the Summer Institute on the Internet and Democracy, July 8 and 9, 2004. Professors Elin, Davis and Reeher are the authors of Click on Democracy: The Internet'sPowerto Change Political Apathy into Civic Action (Westview Press, 2002).     I was involved in an intriguing conference , last week at Syracuse, and this was a question I had.   ACCESS Will the network society be inclusive or is there a danger that certain sectors of the population will be left out?   Already there has been some provocative discussion  on this list and others about why Bush should not have to talk to the NAACP.   In Washington, DC we learn that the president goes to affinity groups, not wanting to waste his time with those who might have different opinions.   So my question is what kind of democracy is it when , or if a whole population is just excluded, either by accident, if that is possible, or by totally not involving them in the conversation.   Meetup    urlLink http://www.meetup.com/    In the conference proceedings and a part of the conference was this great project called Meet-up.  People in your town share your interests. Join their Meetups!  • 	Free monthly get-togethers about thousands of topics • 	Over 1,327,000 people in more than a thousand cities  As the pictures of the groups were shown, as a minority, I noted no pictures of minorities. I often wonder if people do this by mistake, but they went from Dean to dogs, and there was not a multicultural face in the photos . There were a lot of photos. So I wondered , if this was deliberate or just a mistake. Sometimes when the photos are taken people are insensitive to showing representation of inclusive groups.   The speaker seemed to indicate that it was not by accident. So this question again came to mind..Will the network society be inclusive or is there a danger that certain sectors of the population will be left out?If no one on the internet knows you are a dog, pun intended do you get invited to participate.. or what does it mean when there is no representation particularly when the internet is what it is.   I am still wondering about this . I know that the Bush House Parties are a variation of this. Is this where racism rears its ugly head? It looks as if one could join up, but I am still pondering the lilywhite montage of photos.(I did a little homework , and will go to a geographically friendly meetup to see...) What is your experience?   Is there segregation in meetups? You know that invisible kind of exclusion?The people presenting seemed to think that minorities were not interested. You probably know that Meetups were the engine of the Dean campaign. (yes, I know it was Vermont).   Bonnie Bracey

      You can't honestly tell me that members of Congress are surprised that  urlLink people find the color-coded threat system vague  and maybe just a little bit confusing. And really, what does it mean? Does "orange" mean wear a helmet when you go out? Does "red" mean hold off on your grocery shopping? When it comes down to it, if someone's going to fly an airplane into a building or a bridge somewhere, it's unlikely I'll be able to do much from my apartment on Syracuse, NY's north side. Making people panicky just doesn't help.

      Rap artist  urlLink Jadakiss  is apparently  urlLink causing a stir  by blaming George Bush for the fall of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 in his song "Why" (watch the video  urlLink here ). Rashaun Hall, writing for Reuters and  Billboard , leads with:   Musicians often voice political opinions in their songs, especially during an election year. Most hip-hop acts, however, have remained mum on the current political environment -- until now.   I grew up on Run DMC, Public Enemy, and NWA. To me, rap  is  political, and I wish more artists in the mainstream would join Jadakiss in speaking up more, if they're not.

      It's not just safety or whatever that is causing the administration to  urlLink consider postponing elections  in the case of a terror attack -- it's what happened in Spain. Obviously, they're not talking about bombs on the train tracks, because that would  be  the attack -- they're talking about the fact that in the elections that quickly followed that bombing, the  incumbent party was ousted . Republicans don't want to be put in the position of being booted because they couldn't prevent or respond correctly to a terrorist attack? Come on, it's part of  governing , people!

      I might be delirious, but I swear I just saw a George W. Bush commercial that said John Kerry took time out from campaigning to vote against the Laci Peterson law, which "protects pregnant women from violence." See, actually, pregnant women are protected from violence just like the rest of us. We don't need a separate law to protect a segment of the population that is already protected. The Laci Peterson law makes it an additional crime to harm a pregnant woman's unborn fetus. It's one thing to be perhaps a bit misleading in a political ad. To outright  lie , however...

      Bobby Fischer, best known to those of us of a younger generation as the subject of the film  urlLink  Searching for Bobby Fischer   but really an international chess champion  actually  known for winning a 1972 match against Boris Spassky -- is in a  urlLink bad state these days . He's been detained in Tokyo and is afraid of being assassinated if he's extradited to the U.S., where he is wanted because he violated economic sanctions in 1992 when he went to Yugoslavia for a rematch against Spassky.

      Here's an interesting piece by Kelly McBride on the  urlLink issues journalists face  by crossing picket lines at the Democratic National Convention. Despite being awarded a 14.5% raise over the next 4 years by an arbitrator,  urlLink police will still picket  at the convention. The vast majority of reporters at daily newspapers are union members, so for them, covering the convention -- something they  must  do as responsible journalists -- means possibly going against their personal loyalties. One solution might be for newspapers to send freelancers or part-timers who are not part of unions, but then they may be sending the top of their respective talent pools. It'll be interesting to see if any of the mainstream media pick this up.

      In 1948, to create Israel, a team of European (mostly English) politicians drew some seemingly random lines on a map, giving birth (or re-birth, really) to a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. Displaced Arabs revolted through the years, and as part of having warded off a 1967 attack, Israel seized land from Egypt known as the Gaza Strip, which is home to some 7,500 Jews. Arabs in Gaza number many times that. Facts and Logic about the Middle East (FLAME) has been taking out ads in major U.S. magazines  urlLink saying Jews should not leave Gaza because terrorist attacks will just increase . Meanwhile, the European community again wants  urlLink to be part of the solution  to settling things in the region. I don't mean to be defeatist about this whole thing, but control over Jerusalem has changed hands 30 times in the last 2400 years. Is there hope that there will  actually be  peace in the area? I just don't get it.

      It seems the  urlLink DNC  has  urlLink asked Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya to remove their banners  from their boxes at the Fleet Center for the upcoming Convention. It's unclear at this point whether any other networks were asked, so we don't know if this is a ploy to get the Arab networks' banners out of sight, or to make room in general for more Kerry-Edwards banners. There was nothing on the story on  urlLink Al-Jazeera's site  this morning, so they can't be too upset about it, unless they're worried that complaining will get their credentials pulled, since this is the first convention they're being allowed to cover.

      Maybe with the 9/11 Commission's assertion that you really can't  urlLink wage war against an enemy called "terrorism," , we'll finally start to learn that you can't declare war on  things . As a child of the '80s, my favorite is Ronald Reagan's "War on Drugs."  urlLink D.A.R.E.  is the 800-pound gorilla. It goes wherever it wants to go, and nobody likes to admit that 20 years out,  it doesn't work , and it never has. Similarly, we're fighting a war against a concept called terrorism, and we don't know who all the terrorists are, where they might be, or what they might do. It can't work in the way we're going at it.   UPDATE:  Mortimer Zuckerman thinks he's got it all figured out:  urlLink it's the radical Islamists we're fighting . Though Saddam Hussein never fit that description, and neither does de facto Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat, upon whom we've blamed terrorist actions. Zuckerman seems surprised that terrorists would deign to  fight back , as if someone against whom war was declared would just stand up and say, "Hey! I'm the enemy! Come get me!"

      Obviously, we'll know more when the report is released in a couple of hours (or perhaps when the president speaks in a couple of minutes), but the  NYT  reports that the 9/11 Commission will  urlLink suggest changes in the way Congress oversees intelligence agencies , though CBS is reporting the Commission will call for  urlLink an intelligence overhaul . MSNBC says  urlLink Congress, Congressional committees, Bush and Clinton  will be blamed.  USA Today  reports that  urlLink governmental failings were not to blame, per se . Gore! No, Bush! Gore! Bush! Well, we don't know who won, we're just the media - we go on speculation, not facts. Oh well. The report it is.

      I won't be seeing  urlLink  The Village   until next weekend. I don't faun over M. Night Shyamalan's movies, but I do enjoy them. They're excellent works of fiction (at least the previous three -  The Sixth Sense ,  Unbreakable  and  Signs ), and I can lose myself in them for the nearly two hours they run. They're not too long -- I'll never forgive  Braveheart  for the numb rear end I had going into the last 45 minutes -- and I don't feel like I've been tricked into seeing a half-hour cartoon for $10.  But that's what they are. They're entertaining fiction. They come out in summer, as part of the slasher/action/dumb comedy summer movie set. They're not  Ghandi . They're not  Fahrenheit 9/11 . They're not movies that bring up issues and make people think. And they weren't meant to be.  Slate's  David Edelstein  urlLink hated  The Village   because he wasn't having deep philosphical conversations about it. Michael Agger, who writes for the same online magazine,  urlLink hates Shyamalan , because he's a young powerful filmmaker who doesn't use his power to make anything but fluffy, entertaining films. Frankly, I'm OK going to see an entertaining film. There's a reason film reviews tend to be printed in newspapers'  entertainment  sections. Some films are meant to distract people and take them out of the real world for a couple of hours at a time. Cripes, people, go  relax  and enjoy a movie, will you?

      ABCNews president David Westin makes the case that  urlLink the networks are not to blame  for not running as much prime-time convention coverage as critics would like. Westin said that people could pay to have full convention coverage over cable TV or the Internet. But  not everybody can afford  to pay for Internet access or cable TV. Broadcast airwaves in the U.S. are owned by taxpayers and we let networks use them  for free , on the grounds that they will act in the public interest. Which to me says they will cover things like political conventions for the people who most need to be served by the government.

      I didn't watch  urlLink John Kerry's speech . I knew it would be loaded with applause and energy because it had to be, and that I'd miss the substance, so I just decided I'd read it this morning. Before blogging about the speech, I read that Matt Yglesias  urlLink thought it was "crap,"  but that  urlLink it didn't matter what he thought , as he'd be voting for Kerry anyway. Josh Marshall's early thoughts are that the speech  urlLink was "solid,"  and hopefully he'll elaborate on that.  urlLink Jennifer  said in an e-mail that she "got her cry on" a couple of times during the speech.  I'm in the Yglesias camp. I live in typically Democratic-voting New York, and I'll be  urlLink voting for Kerry anyway . But the content of the speech, I thought, dealt too much with the military, and was entirely  what people wanted to hear , not what Kerry would actually do. That said, there are some passages I'd look at closer.  "Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity."  Fifty years of peace and prosperity? Was that after World War II? A time period that included the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and Desert Storm, among the other places in which America interceded, including Afghanistan and Iran?  "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States."  If Kerry struck a chord at all, it was here. Read very slowly, though, this part of the speech takes -- what, 40 seconds? -- to read, and as Matt pointed out, this was a long, not-so-detailed speech. Other than on the first line of that paragraph, Kerry doesn't elaborate on any of it (he says at one point that "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction doesn't make it so"). It really is just  what people want to hear .  "We're the can do people."  This is probably just me, but I picture long rows of people walking in unison all wearing white t-shirts that say  WE ARE  CAN DO  PEOPLE  on the front, repeating in a high monotone, "Can do. Can do. Can do."  "We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?  "I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation – not the Saudi royal family.  "And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East."  I would love to hear this energy plan. Does it require SUVs meet a 30 mpg city fuel efficiency standard? Does it require faster movement in developing lower cost hybrid vehicles? How about research into hydrogen as a mass-market fuel? Or is it instead going to bring back the days of oil rationing, cutting down on commutes (which can only hurt one's ability to work) and vacations (which can only hurt the tourist industry)? Where are the details?

      I've decided that I don't know if I can trust John Edwards. He certainly  urlLink made some promises last night , and "Hope is on the way" isn't the worst campaign slogan in the history of campaigns (remember Bush the First's "Read my lips: No new taxes"?), but I don't feel he's drawn up a plan for fulfilling those promises -- short of removing the tax cuts for the top 2% of Americans. That's not to say I won't be voting Democrat this year, and it's not to say I can't be persuaded that hope is, indeed, on the way, but I'm a bit on the wary side right now. I'm with  urlLink Josh Marshall  to the extent that I really can't argue with any of the hopeful sentiments.  Edwards certainly spoke well last night, but we knew he was a successful trial lawyer and that he obviously would be well-spoken. It's more a matter for me of wondering if he and Kerry can deliver the hope they promise.

      I won't go through Illinois State Senator Barack Obama's life story --  urlLink The New Yorker  and  urlLink The Atlantic  can do that for you. But I am going back through his  urlLink convention speech , which, as I was watching it last night, seemed intelligent, smart, and moved me in a way that no speech from a Democrat has moved me -- ever. I'm going to pull out quotes of note for you.  "Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'  "That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles."  Obama's choice of the  urlLink Declaration of Independence  as a source to quote might be trite for a politician, but probably still holds plenty of excitement for the child of an immigrant. And I really like the "small miracles" bit. It just feels warm and fuzzy, which most politicians just aren't these days.  "And fellow Americans—Democrats, Republicans, Independents—I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour."  Here in Syracuse, this rings true -- all except the $7/hr part, which here reads $5.15/hr minimum. That I'm having trouble finding a place to  apply  to for part-time work, never mind to actually work at, is unusual. It's because Nestle, Carrier, Kraft, Ethan Allen and others just keep closing up here, putting several thousand people out of work (this is since I moved here a year ago), and driving people who had been with their companies for an average of almost 30 years and making an average of about $17/hour to the mall food court. I've never before bought a  Times  at a newsstand where, when it's slow, the minimum wage worker behind the counter was dying for an intelligent conversation as to what was in the paper.  "A belief that we are connected as one people. If there’s a child on the south side of Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there’s a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandmother. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It’s that fundamental belief—I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sisters’ keeper—that makes this country work. It’s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. 'E pluribus unum.' Out of many, one."  This is where I kind of perked up last night. John Edwards spent a lot of his primary campaign talking about "Two Americas," but it's clear just by looking at him that he's no longer a part of the one that he came from. But it was unclear to me throughout the campaign how Edwards planned to connect to the "other" America. Obama freely admits that he's different from an illiterate child, a poor senior citizen, and others, but he recognizes that when others around him have a greatly lessened quality of life, his quality of life is lessened, and he wants to do something about it. That's a vision I can get behind.  Oddly, though, the text of the speech seems to be cut on the Dems' Web site. I'm certain Obama said something about erasing the notion that a black child carrying a backpack full of books is acting white or some such thing. It's through this notion of equality, of erasing lines between race, income, etc., that I feel Obama connected so well to people, and he's doing it better than people have in the best in terms of political success. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Jesse Jackson have all been out somewhere on the fringe despite the large number of people they were able to rally; Obama, on the other hand, may very well become only the third black senator ever.

      I heard on NPR today that Tuesday night was the lowest rated night of the Convention, in terms of lining up speakers. Between Barack Obama's speech and the reaction so far to Ron Reagan (who is still speaking as I write this), this feels much more exciting than everyone except Bill Clinton than last night, and I have to say, Howard Dean got just as many applause when he was introduced. On a personal note, with tonight's speeches (particularly Obama and Reagan's), I feel much more connected to the Democratic Party than I have since I first registered to vote in 1994. If I could be this impressed with John Kerry, I would consider not being registered as "unaffiliated."

      I can't wait to read the transcript from Barack Obama's speech. He's saying a lot of really good things. He's not going to be ready to be the presidential candidate in 2008, but people are saying he'll be president someday. Given that he's black and his father is an immigrant,Ii'm cynical enough to say this guy's going to have to be as exciting as Bill Clinton to get elected, so perhaps the Dems can get Andy Carville on this guy or something.   UPDATE:  OK, so that was my thought halfway through the speech, he's almost there. If the guy smiled occasionally, he'd get elected tomorrow. No wonder Mike Ditka didn't want to run against this guy.

      MSNBC's Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann really liked Ted Kennedy's speech, mainly citing that it was about history, and it connected history to today. It was also, however, a not-nearly-as-veiled-as-last-night's-speeches bashing of Bush, which as I undetstand it is "against party lines," though Kennedy for the past 40 or so years has been the party line, whether he's on program or off. He said something about King George, which despite being a historical reference, is obviously a reference to the fact that our current president "inherited" the "throne" from his father. Kennedy also said something to the effect of, "We need to return wisdom and honesty to the White House," which one commentator pointed out actually means, "The guy who's in the White House is a dumb liar." This is one of those speeches, though, that I'll have to read most of, because despite my having grown up with it in my family, I just can't listen carefully to anyone with a Boston accent for very long. I'll probably get on that tomorrow.

      MSNBC has had Ben Affleck on for the last 10 or so minutes, and despite his very scary way-too-white teeth, the actor is impressive. I wasn't so impressed earlier when he took Katie Couric out for a cheeseburger, but he's been going back and forth really well with Chris Matthews and the rest of the panel. Color me really quite impressed.

      Drudge has a transcript of an interview between  urlLink Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore  set to air tonight. I  really  hope this doesn't become another "Shove it!" non-story that gets played over and over and over and...It's really just pointless yelling -- it's easy to see what point each is trying to make, they're just hammering away and they never say anything that sounds halfway intelligent until the transcript mercifully says, "END."

      Now that I've had some time to let the convention speeches speak in, I'm going back to read the transcripts and comment on them in hindsight. Here goes:   urlLink Al Gore   I'm still generally annoyed by this speech. Not only was it 15 minutes or so of  urlLink borderline slapstick  schtick, but it's painfully clear Gore is not over the 2000 election. It's time for Gore and the Democratic party to get over 2000. There are bigger things to think about, like, say, the 2004 election.   urlLink Jimmy Carter   I'll say again that it was a  urlLink fantastic idea  to put Carter up there. He criticized the hell out of the Iraq war, talked about being in the Navy (equating his service with Kerry's), and was generally impressive. Moreover, he didn't say George Bush's name once.   urlLink Hillary Clinton   Senator Clinton had a lot of good stuff to say in not very much time. Unfortunately, I didn't catch any of it while she was saying it. I see why she wasn't initially invited to speak: she's  boring .   urlLink Bill Clinton   I've been hearing all day about how electrifying Clinton was (and is) -- in fact, Matt Yglesias even called him a  urlLink "true blue motherfucking rock star" . It was clear that he was a big hit -- hell, he almost had  me  saying, "Send me!" along with him. But he still went on about 5 minutes too long (which is still better than 1988).

      Maybe someone actually at the convention can attest to this, but could the fact that  urlLink there are fewer protestors than expected  at the DNC perhaps be attributed to the tiny, out-of-the-way protest facilities and the fact that many will not submit to a search?

      How to destroy business  urlLink in one easy step . For those business travelers who have to get from Boston to New York or New York to Boston (throw Philadelphia in there somewhere, too) -- which is a lot of people -- they won't be able to make last minute plans to hop a train. While the Yahoo! story doesn't say how many travelers typically take the affected routes, those trains are often full. For those people who take the train so that they can work during the commute, driving will not be a good substitute, and let's face it, air travel isn't as convenient as it used to be, which is probably why the trains tend to be full.

      Three minutes ago, Bill Clinton had an excellent leaving opportunity with a final loud chorus of "Send me!" But now he's reciting scripture, and then talking about America being at a crossroads, and I think if he doesn't shut up in a second, I'm going to turn it off.

      There was all this talk about "no Bush-bashing" during the convention speeches. It seems the strategy for that is to simply not say the president's name. Al Gore did it, Jimmy Carter did it, and Bill Clinton is not only doing it, he's spending an awful lot of time talking about what he did as president. Somehow, it seems, "This president did bad things to good programs that we started, so John Kerry and John Edwards is your team!" is Clinton's rallying cry. I don't get it.

      To an extent, the Beeb's got it right: Political conventions in the U.S.  urlLink  are for show , not to do something important like, say, pick a presidential candidate (which is what used to happen). One important thing this convention is doing, though, is bringing together people with some different views. Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich told an MSNBC reporter that he still disagreed with John Kerry on such issues as the war in Iraq (Kerry voted for it, Kucinich against), but he was there to support Kerry and help the Democrats see their way through this election season.

      It turns out that Gore, indeed, spent most of his 15 or so minutes warming up the crowd. It was funny. Really. But I thought it was really smart to follow with Jimmy Carter. I thought Carter's response to the Iraq war and his determination that Kerry would not follow this president with unnecessary military action was heartfelt, convincing and necessary.  Chris Matthews just warned us that Bill Clinton would be speaking soon. I'm scared. I don't think I have 45 minutes in me.   UPDATE:  Here's the  urlLink text of Carter's speech .

      Matt's initial impression covering the convention is that  urlLink Democrats have never been so united . Watching Al Gore speak, it does indeed seem that way. This is a very together, very excited group of people. Gore's speech is bordering on slapstick, but even from my bedroom way up here in Syracuse, this convention is an exciting place to be.

      This morning, Drudge was all up in arms about  urlLink  USA Today  cutting an Ann Coulter column . Coulter was to be the conservative columnist opining about the convention, but the  urlLink column that didn't appear  is, well, dumb. Coulter can see the differences between Democrats and Republicans primarily by looking at the women. Republican women are pretty, and they roll their eyes when liberal men won't hit on them because the U.N. hasn't approved the move as something that isn't a violation of human rights. Democratic women, on the other hand, are fat, dirty, hairy, bra-shunning hippies. What planet is Coulter living on? And while I don't know Jonah Goldberg's work (he has been  urlLink hired to fill Coulter's role for  USA Today  ), he can't be any worse.

       urlLink Local rehabilitation, bribery , it's all the same. U.S. troops are handing out cold, hard cash to Iraqis to get them to like, or at least not attack, Americans. The money comes from the upper levels of the military; brigade leaders are given money monthly for "local rehabilitation and emergency welfare projects," though I'm sure the welfare mentioned isn't supposed to be the troops' welfare. Hmm...then again, I could conceivably stop blogging bad about Bush if he'd funnel some cash my way. Yeah, that's the ticket. Let the bidding begin!

      Despite my better judgement, I've decided come out and endorse the  urlLink John Kerry/John Edwards ticket . I say despite my better judgement, because frankly, these guys aren't the best for America. But they're better than Bush, and they can beat Bush. In 2000, I elected to endorse learning about the candidates and just voting, but this year, I'm playing the part of the anybody-but-Bush liberal and asking you to vote for Kerry-Edwards as a vote against Bush. I fear that while we've gone from not-so-bad to really really bad in nearly four years under this administration, another four years would be devastating to the U.S. and possibly the world in terms of the economy, jobs, civil liberties, morale, and international support. Emogame's  urlLink Bush game  is a really good educational tool to pass on and help explain why we need Bush out of office. Given the low level of success attained by Ross Perot in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000, neither Nader nor Green Party candidate David Cobb is likely to win the presidency. Please cast your vote for Kerry/Edwards on November 2.

      Why is it that the people who  need  political information the most -- those who are among the most poverty-stricken in the country; those who are homeless; those who rely on the federal government for their livelihood -- can't get that information? The broadcast networks are expected to each  urlLink offer 3 hours of coverage spread over 4 nights  of the Democratic Convention. PBS and NPR will be there for 3 hours each night, but that demographic isn't typically tuned into PBS or NPR. That someone who has to pay unnecessary service to get proper information before voting in a presidential election is just a travesty.

      I'm one of those people who is glad that Michael Moore has decided to speak out with a decidedly leftist angle, but am wary to have him be  the  mouthpiece for the left - his methods are often obnoxious, his facts as twisted for his message as the facts put out by people on the right for their purposes. Case in point: He's taking part in a number of Boston-area speaking engagements this week, none of which are inside the Fleet Center. Yet, he declares to be "honored" to speak at the events " urlLink surrounding the Democratic National Convention ."  His message is generally good, but again, I often feel embarrassed to have him represent the left.   UPDATE:  In fact, as it turns out, the Convention organizers  urlLink specifically didn't want him there .

The Electoral Vote Predictor Page (at 8 a.m. on Sunday) also has  urlLink Bush with 217  electoral votes, but has Kerry with 310. The two are exactly tied for Tennessee's 11 electoral votes.

      I can hear the docents now: "And over there on the left, behind the razor wire fencing, are  urlLink what we call protestors . They're a throwback to the 1960s, when many people disagreed with the United States' military action in Vietnam. After large demonstrations back then, people thought they could come out and  protest  -- that is, speak their opposition on -- pretty much anything. In order to make sure the majority of people hear only what we want them to hear, and to ensure that the general public isn't bombarded with unwanted opinions, we allow a select few of them to stand mostly out of site and shout their slogans from afar."  Limiting the number of protestors to 1,000 is not only going to show a gross underestimation of the numbers of people who want to voice their dissent, it is going to make it difficult for protestors to make themselves heard on their issues -- some will be anti-abortion, some will be anti-war, some will be pro-electoral reform, some will be pro-civil liberties. There simply will be too many issues for any one group to have a major showing if the numbers are capped at 1,000.  And can you imagine what would happen if the RNC looked at the aftermath of this and offered more to protestors at the Republican Convention? People will start to think it is the Republicans who support civil liberties, despite the administration's record on liberties over the past three and a half years. This really can't be good for tbe Dems.

The Illinois race will be a historic one, though, as it is the first in which two black men will square off for senator. The winner (any takers?) will be only the third black senator. Ever.

      Jack Shafer has some  urlLink pretty harsh words  for Ben Bagdikian, who has just released  urlLink  The New Media Monopoly  , which is really just the seventh edition of  The Media Monopoly , which was first published in 1983 (the sixth edition came out in 2000). Not having read the seventh edition, I can't vouch specifically for or against his criticisms of the book, but indeed through the first six editions, Bagdikian moved from largely criticizing the newspaper industry to bigger media companies like Time Warner and Disney. Shafer writes that the old criticisms of the newspaper industry are probably still valid, and gosh darn it, I think he's right.  Newspapers are in the unique position of being able to come out reasonably quickly -- much more quickly than the weekly newsmagazines -- but not so quickly that they pounce on a story with one eye closed just trying to beat their competitors by 10 minutes like the 24-hour television news channels. Newspapers can sit back for a little while on a story, watch the immediate repercussions, and explain to readers the impact a story may have on them. But perhaps not enough of them do.   USA Today  is the most circulated paper in the country. Over 2 million people pick it up Monday through Friday, and if it is assumed that each copy is read by two people (figuring that a number of copies might be read by entire households of five or six), four million people get their news from that source. The paper is owned by Gannett, which owns  urlLink several hundred other  newspapers in the U.S. and U.K., along with some television stations and joint ventures that include the Major League Baseball team the Cincinnatti Reds, a national career search network, and a national classified advertising network. The career search and classified advertising networks, incidentally, are joint ventures with some of the other largest U.S. newspapers chains in terms of circulation. Meanwhile,  USA Today , which reaches perhaps 4 million readers, revolutionized the news industry when it was launched in 1981 by running short snippets of news. Because the paper was so profitable, many other newspapers have followed suit. And you know what that means, right? Right. Half-assed newspaper stories that amount to 30 second television spots and don't explain events and their implications.  Even when newspapers take the time to explain events and, say, newly passed legislation to readers, under the bigger corporate structure, they have little incentive to make clear the implications for particular communities. It's much cheaper to either (a) buy wire service stories, or (b) share news amongst its newspapers.  The New York Times  is known for being amoung the country's best news sources (despite its former lack of a policy on anonymous sources, as we found out in the Jayson Blair case -- the company now has a new policy, available for download  urlLink here ), but why make the news pertain to New Yorkers when folks who read the  Boston Globe  and the  Times'   urlLink other papers  in Ocala, Fla., Lexington, N.C., and Petaluma, Calif., would read the same story? Sharing stories across newspapers is something a lot of companies do -- in fact, the  urlLink  Springfield (Mass.) Republican  , a  urlLink Newhouse  publication, has been known to run full series of stories that originated at other Newhouse papers about goings on in towns that the people of Western Massachusetts care little about.  The lesson in all of this is, be sure to read multiple news sources. Be sure to question what you see in print, and look to alternative news sources for stories that might not otherwise be reported. Don't assume that just because media (print or otherwise) give big play to a story, a story is important.

      There's some interesting quotes in this  Times  article about  urlLink what "normal" people think  about the terrorist threat level. The article appears to be inspired by the elevated alert levels at financial institutions in Washington and New York earlier this week.   "They messed that thing up so badly that at this point, I don't believe anything they tell us," Mr. Gilmore said. "There's always an ulterior motive somewhere."   Then there's another, who thinks it's all about the timing:   "You hear that they found plans and computer discs, so you think maybe there's something to it,'' Mr. De Santis said. "Then a day later, it turns out that a lot of the information is three years old, five years old. So I get suspicious. Isn't it a convenient time to have a terror alert, right after the convention?"   There are also some, though, who think we should listen.   "In light of 9/11, you have to take it seriously," Mr. Thorne said. "I don't think it's a political play for votes. If they're going to do that, they'll do it in September or October."    The thing is, though, what are we listening to? "Elevated terror alert level?" How should I live my life differently if the terror alert level is normal or elevated? The system definitely needs some reforming.

      Dan Byman says we're  urlLink safer than we think  we are, but to be honest, we just don't know. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 surprised most of us "normal people," that is, those of us who don't deal in intelligence, defense and national security and obviously, they suprised most of the people who  do , as well, though the 9/11 Commission report names several points at which they shouldn't have come as so big a surprise. Looking back, the 9/11 attacks took 5 years from suggestion to carrying out. If Al Qaeda waited to see the results of 9/11 to see what they could learn before figuring on the next attack, it may still be a couple of years down the line.  The worst thing about preventing attacks is we can't really measure the success. It was just about 60 years between attacks on U.S. soil between Pearl Harbor and 9/11. What's success? When nothing happens, are we succeeding at prevention, or just waiting for something to happen? The real test might be to see if we can actually intercept an attack when it's off the ground, but then again, if we let it get that far, haven't we failed? The point is, we have to live as though we're safe. It's always OK to keep your eyes open -- watch for things like bags left unattended, but we can't let fear affect us daily. If it does, we'll definitely know we've failed.

      If you want to know the truth about what's going on in Iraq, don't listen to the partisan bickering going on here in the States: Listen to the people who actually live there. Riverbendblog's author yesterday  urlLink wrote her first post in 6 weeks  thanks in part to the conditions that people in Baghdad are living under. She cools herself off at the refrigerator (which also provides light sometimes). The electricity is on an average of 8 hours a day, though recently it has been as little as 1 hour or as much as 12. Residents can't tell the difference between Western aid workers and Western hired guns. So many people are dying that cemetery owners are filling already-purchased family plots with strangers and making the people who already own those plots find another spot. It's even difficult to schedule time at a mosque for mourning rituals. If you really want to know what's going on, listen to the people who know.

      Every few weeks, I try to get together with Kai Wang, a Taiwanese student who for the last year has been taking his master’s degree in public relations at  urlLink SU’s Newhouse School . We sit somewhere, taking in some aspect of a American culture and discussing the differences in the culture, political systems, economics, education, etc., of our respective home lands. Yesterday, he brought along Monica, a Taiwanese student who has been in Syracuse for a month starting her master’s in advertising. Kai’s bringing Monica along, it turns out, is part of what I think is a wonderful tradition: When Taiwanese students decide to come to Newhouse, they are given contact information (independently of the school) of other Taiwanese students who have already been at the school for a year. The veteran students take the new students under their wing, picking them up from the airport, showing them around town, making sure they are able to find an apartment, etc. To show how vastly different this is from the way Americans act at the school: When Mary Beth Ray, who starts next month in Newhouse’s media studies program, came to a prospective students’ day on campus, she was fairly shocked to find that the school did not have in place a program wherein current students offer their couches for the night to people traveling long distances to see the program. We found her a couch (mine), but that the school wouldn’t have thought of such a program is rather telling, I think.  Kai, Monica and I started yesterday at  urlLink The Syracuse Suds Factory , a decidedly American experience, with the brewery’s beer tanks sitting in the front window. We then walked over to Clinton Square for the scholastic portion of  urlLink Jazz in the Square .  urlLink Dave Samuels , formerly of  urlLink Sypro Gyra , was on hand to give notes on stage to school-aged jazz players. The Liverpool High School Jazz Ensemble has some pretty remarkable players, including a fantastic tenor player and a guitarist who is probably playing in some punk band that is boring the hell out of him because  that boy can  play  . We caught the Mood Swings, as well, and then moved on to  urlLink Onondaga Lake Park , where we set out on the walking trail for a little while.  It was on the walking path that Kai and Monica were introduced to the meanness of sea gulls, the seemingly cute, white  jerks  that populate shorelines and mall parking lots. Monica took the leftover bread from Kai’s open-faced steak sandwich and fed it to the gulls, who promptly walked all over each other and pecked at each other as they scavenged for a bite. We then met an even meaner child as we walked by the marina. While his guardian of the moment was on a boat making some adjustments, this kid, who must have been 5 or so, was throwing rocks at a group of ducks, who were sticking around because they evidently thought they were getting food. I’m not sure I’ve ever had as big a desire to grab a kid by his life preserver and throw him in the lake.  We then returned to the jazz festival for some of  urlLink Jon Seiger and the All Stars’  set. Seiger has evidently been studying Louis Armstrong for years, because he’s got Satchmo’s voice  down , which made for a wonderful set of popular jazz. We went back to the apartment for a bit so Monica could meet  urlLink Binky (in the top photo) , and then we headed back downtown for dinner.  We walked into  urlLink Kitty Hoynes , and were greeted by a band setting up in the small bar. We were ushered into a loud but not annoying dining room where we loaded up our bellies on traditional Irish fare: Corned beef and cabbage for me, shepherd’s pie for Monica, and fish and chips for Kai (it all came to less than $30, by the way). Heading out through the bar area, we found that the band,  urlLink Wild Geese , was fun, in a get drunk and sing-a-long way, a la the  urlLink Drunk Stuntmen . Bellies full, we went to a now  packed  Clinton Square for  urlLink Dave Samuels’  set and then headed out.  The lesson here, the appeal, really, is that you find someone with a different cultural background to share experiences with. It’s interesting, rewarding, and gosh darn it, it might even make you a better (or at least more well-rounded) person!  Incidentally, if you made it this far, thanks for reading this post. My web browser crashed  twice  while I was typing it, so for the third attempt I went to less-trusty Word, which at least offers the ability to save every 12 seconds.
