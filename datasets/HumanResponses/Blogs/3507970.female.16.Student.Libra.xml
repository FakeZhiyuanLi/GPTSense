      WOOOOOOOOOOOH!!HE DOES AS WELL, HE SAID HE DID!!HE SAID 'I LOVE YOU' TO US WOOOOOOOOOOH!!  right, well if your not jane, nazrene or alice, you wont have a clue what im going on about, so i shall explain. basically, HARRY SAID HE LOVES US!!!!WOOOOOOOOOOOH!! (US=ALICE AND ME)oh and the SEXAY danny blew TWO kisses at nazrene, and both tom and dougie gave us disapproving looks (cos of our banner, which read 'SHOW US YOUR PANTS MCFLY').so yeah, you see, mcfly and us were MEANT to be :-D *sigh* harrys is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO prettiful I LUV HIM!!!if you STILL dont know what im tlking about, well, you must either be really DENSE, or i just never told you.   the olympic torch concert!!!it was amazing!! the stroy all began on the saurday morning, about 9.00ish. the four mrs mcflys (jane, alice, nazrene and moi) all met at mrs levine/brody's house. well nazrene had spent the night there, and suceeded in waking jane up at like 2 in the morning, and not getting to sleep herself until like 4, the silly child.anyways, we got to janes and admires the BOOOTIFULLY unique banner, and then left for the station. we partayed down to St. James' Station and then headed towards the St James' park...which sounds pretty sensible doesnt it, seeing as on the tickets, it said the concert was in St James park. but NO! we ended up having to wander ALL the way around the outside of the park, when we could simply have cut across the park!!so as you can imagine, we were pretty tired by this time, especially seeing as it was rainig...and i mean the annoying kinda drizzle that is typical of good ol england. you know the type, it was just te continuous pitter patter, which i couod NOT stand, especially after having straightened my hair i was NOT gonna let the rain ruin it. why cant we just have PROPER rain...thats so much easier to deal with. anyway, enough about the weather.  we found the queue at about 12 i think, and we were pretty near the front. but that did mean that we had to stand there for like 2 hours doing nothing apart form keeping the rain away from my hair and keeping alice warm (SHE WASNT WEARING ANYTHING...well she was, just nothing warm). so at about 2 the gates opened, and there were like at least 25,000 people behind us and like 20 peoepl in front of us, but nazrene still managed to manoevore (how the HELL do u spell it?) us further forward. i was VERY impressed. so there we were, four ickle girls in the middle if this MASIVE crowd, hanging on to each other for dear life. we squeezed throught the gates, and then nazrene being the source of an abundance of energy, sprinted ALL the way down the mall and to the stage. she managed to drag alice down with her, but me and jane just couldnt keep up, and decided to stroll down like litle od ladies.  bgut when we did get there we were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO near the front, and right by the waterfall thing that steven redgrave ran up...it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO cool. anytway the forst like three acts, were people that we'd never heard of, but were pretty cool all the same. and then came the FANTASTIC...wait for it....*drumroll*...MARK OWEN!! yup thats mark owen from the biggest boy band of ALL time.(am i the only one who fancies him?) AND HE WAVED AT US LIKE 5 TIMES!!!  anyway, cant remeber the actual order after that, but V performed abnd i got to ogle over my ickle baby aaron, and i think there were some more but i cant really remeber. anyway, we finally got to like the climax of the concert....the one the only legendry JAMES BROWN!! he was SOOO amazing in his coolio red thing, and with his little dancey things. and then he did his duet with will young, and they walked like right passed us!!as in they were loike 2 meters away from us!!but i was just too flusterd and excited to wind my camera up and get a picture of james brown walking past us, but i managed to get one of will young's back (i SOO rock at taking photos)  and then...it was MCFLYS TURN!! they are SOOOO incredible live!!i know that the main reason i like them is because theyre all just sooooo fit (yes ALL of them, even the 'fat one' *gives alice evil look*), but they REALLY are AMAZING musicians. they sang 5 colours in her hair, obviously, and then a cover of she loves me by the beatles. they were fucking incredible (i have such a limited vocab range that ive had to resort to using swear words...SORRY). OMG!!!I SCREAMED 'HARRY' WHEN TOM WAS TALKING, (so everyone else was queit) AND HARRY TURNED AROUNG AND WAVED!!!!WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!! its true that he probably didnt hear me, but i can dream. OH AND DANNY BLEW NAZRENE (and nazrene ONLY) TWO KISSES. AND HARRY BLEW ME AND ALICE A KISS AND THEN MOUTHED 'I LOVE YOU' AT US (us only and not the other 40,000 people behind us). we THINK that tom and dougie gave us really weird looks due to our banner but we can't be sure. alice reckons the only saw the bottom half of it, which would mean that they could only read 'MCFLY YOUR PANTS' which is NOT what we wanted them to see, but hey...they acknowledged us.  but that was it really. V performed again, and i was wailing cos my baby wasnt coming round to our side of the stage. but when i cried to nazrene 'i want my baby to come to me' my aaron came a-SPINTING across the stage to us, and he was literally like right next to us!! (no i do NOT fancy V, and i do NOT think they are great mnusicians or anything, i just want to be aaron's mum :-D)  then we were live on tv, and rachel stevens, emma bunton, jamelia, beverly knight, kelly and ozzy osbourne, and will young all performed a song each. jamie theakston (who is FIT) told all of you deprived people at home that james brown and mcfly were performing live....BUT HE LIED!! they just showed you their earlier performances.  and finally, at like 7.00, all the celebs came out on stage, and we got some more waves and smiles from mcfly, the osbournes, will young (bless his cotton socks), emma bunton, rachel stevens, beverly knight, jamelia ...and princess anne. at about 7.15, steven redgrave finally came running up the waterfall thingy, and i was all ready to get a photo of him as he ran by, but he splashed us all:-( i did manage to get a photo of him after he'd passed us though, and thats like the ONLY picture thats turned out well!!   and that was about it. we left early cos there were like really weird people on afterwards, people like the operas :-S after 9 hour on our feet we were in SOO much pain, especially as we'd just been on tiffin trek the day before. we shuffled to the train station and made our way home. oh and we were busking at waterloo whilst we were waiting for our train :-D we got the most pitying looks from passers by...i swear we all sounded so drunk, i know i did. oh and on the train, some foreign guy who was sitting next to us hit on nazrene. teehee!!she was NOT amused. he was like 30. when i stood up at our station, i dropped some money, and nazrene being the sweetheart that she is, picked it up for me. ten this guy claimed that there was more money down there, and nazrene was about to bend down again, when she realised that she was wearing a little denim skirt which didnt allow much movement!!  hehehehe!!so thats about it people!! it was an absolutely BRILLIANT day, even though ive probably made it sound really boring. so if you dont believe me just go and ask jane, alice or nazrene, they'll tell you  toodles xxx

      i am in such a GOOD mood. im in waaaaaaaaaaaay too good a mood to revise for physics and history, and you know what? I DONT CARE!! right now, i dont care if i fail my GCSEs, im just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy :-D infact im SO happy, i stated squealing at my physics book for no apparent reason which made sister peer round the door cautiously and leave my room ASAP. now, i know the question thats on all of your minds (thats if anyone is actually reading this): why in the world is shivani so happy? am i right??...probably not, i mean this is me we're talking about. i am NEVER right :-( but anyway, in answer to the question....I HAVE NO IDEA :-D i REALLY dontknow why im so happy. i mean in home and away, dani ran kane (the guy who raped her) over after having kissed her uni lecturer AND scott may be about to dump her, oh and i reckon alex may be injured, poor baby :-( and then there's holyoaks, and everybodys being so MEAN to poor ellie. although, i guess lee's beginning to understand and hes trying to make dan understand too. and dannis little burst of friendship....am i missing something REALLY obvious here, or is she genuinely being nice to ellie??OH AND POOR DEBBIE AND DAN AND DARREN. darren got the crap beaten out of him, but dan rescued him, only to find out that his 'faithful' girlfriend had cheated on him with darren whilst he was in prison. although debbie was right, it should have been her forgiving him, seeing as he was the one who dumped her really harshly >:-(  and as if all of that DRAMA wasn't enough, I HAVE TO MISS THE ENGLAND MATCH :'( ITS NOT FAIR!! mother dearwums reckons i should be revising, which is probably true, but its not like thats actually gonna happen  OH NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CROATIOA JUST SCCORED...according to sister :-S she may be winding me up tho, so shall be back in just a minute. DAMMIT SHE WASNT :'( OH EBGLAND HAVE TO WIN!! and you know what, they WILL, because the KERAZY bunch from 11W are backing them up ALL THE WAY (WOOOOOH!!BUSTED SONG THAT :-D)  right, so after all of that pointless babble, i still ahve no idea why i was so happy...well ok maybe i do (but its all a bit hush hush right now....i think :-S naz/jane/alice is it??) but anyway, all of that random and depressing babble has made me lose the HAPPY vibe, and now im just plain BORED. nobodys online, probably cos theyre all watching the match like all sane people are; i've been listening to all my CDs SOOOOOO much over study leave that i've kinda gotten bored of them (WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!AM GOING TO BUY MCFLYS SINGLE TMRW :-D that shud keep me entertained for a bit)  WOAH!! commotion downstairs...has someone scored?? *creeps into parent's bedroom to check* ok no ones scored and the balls just bouncing ALL over the place! and WOAH, check out the FLOURESCENT goal keeper. maybe sunglasses were a good idea mrs beckham, but you REALLY should have gone to specsavers to get yours...the ones your wearing now are MAHUSIVE!!  ...alice reckons that if england lose it would be amusing...awful, but in a highly amusing way :-S that was a quote (just realised i couldve used quotations marks to make ms cobley proud, but ah well) alice is one weird girl...luvable, but in a weird way :-D  right, well i've run out of things to say to you darling bloggy, so i shall b a-retiring for the time being  CIAO xxxx

      it was, you know...today...the end of an era. 11W officially do not exist anymore. even mr draper admitted that he didnt miss us after he met his new form, although he did ask for a copy of the photo of us bless him. well, so yeah, we found out ou new forms (WOOOOOH!!! me and saima are with alice, nazrene, rachael and rebecca...and the rest of out form are GREAT) and we met our new form tutor, mr richmond. miss krishna got my hopes up by saying that mr richmond was new, young and fit. i was SOOO excited, even though nazrene did point out that miss krishnas taste in guys was somewhat different to most peoples...i mean she is going out with mr reise :-S. but we met this mr richomnd guy and found out that he wasnt fit at all, but he was absoulutely lovely. made us all introduce ourselves and then talk about our work expereince, and then he did the same. he wound up by saying "...and yeah, im a cool guy, i really am. and now we have to go to the dining hall for tea, and you can tell all your frineds how cool i am"...isnt that just sooooo...precious [as regina would say (mean girls)]. anyway that last bit convinced us...mr richmond is TRES coolio.  we then proceded (is that even how u spell it??) to go down to the dining hall where we all screamed at each other, even though it had only been like two weeks since we'd last been together, and then had our ickle tea, joined by our beloved mr draper. and that was that. that was the end of 11w *sob*. we're over. 11w are no longer. its terribly sad, but i guess that theres nothing we can do about it. having a whole 7 weeks of hoilidays ahead of us does sweeten things a bit. OH and of course the MASSIVE poster of charlie in dare magazine looking AMAZINGLY sexy, and the pics of him in sneak wearing NOTHING but his swimming trunks *SWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON* did help...an awful lot. thnks to nazrene who found them :-D  so anyway. there we have it. the end of 11w. i guess i cant really say 'rock on 11w' anymore :'( but i can say I LOVE MY FORM, and i shall see all of you amazingly coolio people in september, even if we're not all together. acually..i guess i'll see some of you over the hols :-D  11W ROCKED!!!HARD!!!

      WOW!! i always knew that mclfy were good, but their album is just absolutely astoundingly, amazingly, dumbfoundingly, flabbergastinlgy, stunningly, brlliantly brilliant. and im not exaggerating (i just went throught the oxford thesauruas to get all those words). its brilliant. i'm no musician like narene so im not gonna like review every single song on the album. nazrene can do that when i give it to her, but seriously, if your not purely into rnb/hiphop only, you WILL like this one. well i reckon you should. its sooooo fucking awesome. its obvioulsy (hehe!!*bursts into mcfly's obviously*) been influenced by the beach boys/beatles. theres this one song, called She Left Me, and danny does this really funny bit...well they all do.   Danny:  i've left messages after the tone...  rest of mcfly:  (with american accent) really??  Danny:  (in true grease style) yeah man loads  oh ho!! its brilliant!! they sound so sexy. nazrene reckons she can imagain the mcfly boys at Rydell High. apparently danny would be in the T-birds and so would harry. tom and dougie would be the geeks though, wearing those thick black rimmed glasses. hehe, i can so imagine that, although i aolso reckon that hary could also pull of being a geek as well :-D  *sigh* if only we could be their pink ladies  oh the album, despite its brilliance, does the make mcfly and jamesey bourne look quite pathetic. most of them are all about girls either being too good for them, girls cheating on them , or girls dumping them. most of them were written by tom, james and danny though, so i guess theyre the loosers and harry and dougie are the studs :-D  oh i LOVE the album cover. tis great and wonderfully random. i have no IDEA wot theyre doing, but as queen naz said, wouldnt you SOOO love to know wot they were thinking when they were posing for them. and for those of you who were wondering, harry looks GREAT :-P  anyway, am off to go meet naz later, so must go do something useful before i leave  cya xxx
