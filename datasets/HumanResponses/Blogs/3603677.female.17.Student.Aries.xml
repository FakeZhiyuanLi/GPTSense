      It's weird how just one day can change your outlook and mood. If you haven't heard the song 'The Reason' you don't know what your missing...this song pretty much describes relationships, and I don't know why I'm saying all of this b/c I'm tired, so I'm babbling...so sorry!

      It's interesting...you see, he called, we talked, figured everything out Tuesday night. It is now Friday night, and I have yet to hear from him! Hmm...imagine that. My family isn't helping much b/c they don't think its right, so they speak their mind and that's the end of it. I want it to work out, but i dunno if it ever will...I just want to get out too...be able to think my own thoughts w/out someone else over my head!

      Somebody shoot me please! Life is going so horrible. I have these feelings that I dont'  want to have b/c I can't do anything about them, and life is just a big mumble jumble of things, and I can't situate them...Why can't life evre work out how we want it to?

      It's about 11 pm, and I'm bored out of my mind once again! Life hasn't been that good lately, and not having anything to do doesn't make it any better...I had to work tonight...that was fun...NOT! Usually the people that I close w/ are in good moods and we have so much fun closing together, but everyone was tired and      y, and just wanted to get out of there...so we didn't have much fun, and there defin. wasn't much talking going on. So in other words, it was long and BORING...the story of my life! But anywhoo...I just got an email from my friend saying that he made it to Cali. (He is moving there forever from here.) It was good to hear from him, but I wish he was still here...oh well, life doesn't always work out how we want it to, Obviously! Speaking of life...I just want everything to work itself out, w/out me in it....blah! Okay, I'm going to bed...I can't talk anymore, its not making sense.

      Whelp, it's 8:06 a.m. and I'm awake and ready for the day! We were sposed to have a car wash today, but well, the rain had another idea, so....I'm up, going, and I'm bored! Nothing new has really gone on here. My parents found a house a few months ago that they liked, and now the ppl in the house have lowered the price by $5000, so now my mom wants it but my dad isn't sure...whatever!   I am so excited that I'm gonna be a SENIOR this year!! One more year and I'm off to college! YAY!  I went out to Red Cedar on Thursday and got to see a bunch of ppl. I didn't wanna leave, but I had to go to the Vet...I wanted to ride soo badly too! I haven't been on a horse since Feb. I'm soo deprived! :) Oh well, I guess I'll be able to when the time is right?   Okay, I'm goin to get some food b/c I'm HUNGRY!

       Today was a halfway decent day. I worked out last night, so that made me feel good, and I woke up early this morning (odd for me, but hey.) My mom and sister and I went over to someone's new house to help em paint. That was fun b/c I like to paint a lot! We got it most of the way finished, but then we had to leave, which was a bummer b/c I wanted to finish it...oh well. Tonight I'm going to my bro's musical, "The Nifty Fifties." It will hopefully be a good show! Whelp Chels, hope you feel better!

       Okay, first of all, since the start of summer, my life has sucked! The only good thing that has happened so far is I got good grades on my report card...other than that...nada! It started out w/ Austin...and all I want him to do is call me so that we can talk, but nooo that is too difficult to do, and someone MIGHT get the wrong idea by that. We "weren't" anymore b/c of our mothers, but now they BOTH say its fine...and he STILL hasn't called me, or talked to me....and i'm NOT going to call him, b/c then I sound desperate...plus that's not my style. I guess I just need someone (perferably a wonderful guy) to be friends with, and someone that will actually talk to me, and not make assumptions! Other than that...life has been boring. My bro has been at school practicing for a musical so far every day, all day...so i'm stuck at home w/ my mom and sister. I'm not saying that is a bad thing, but ya kinda get sick of it after a while! I can't really just call up my friends to go do something, b/c we all live so far apart, that it really doesn't work. And when my bro IS home, we usually try to hang out...go somewhere, but noooo of course not, b/c we have to spend time w/ the " FAMILY." Blah!!! So, i'm really not having a good summer so far, and i'm praying that it only gets better and no worse, b/c that would be soo horrible! Well, I guess that's all I have to say for now...
