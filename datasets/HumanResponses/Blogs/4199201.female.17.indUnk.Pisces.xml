      so this morning i woke up bright and early, 7:45, damn cats. i swear they want to make me go insane. I t doesn't help that i have gotten Zero sleep for the past i can't even count that many days. Wow stupid automated voice recordings from a lawyer keep calling me at 8 o'clock am and i can't yell at them that this phone number is mine now not the criminal i guess. O i am still not kroger. they are 528-6120 for future reference. So i went up and got me schedule this morning. I guess it's okay but it sucks an egg b/c nobody is in any of my classes. and i want M lunch! not freaking K! yeh. Today was also sam's b-day! yeah for being 17! i just got back from her house and its 2 am now. I just don't know how to come in at a reasonable hour anymore. O and i'm pissed that it cost $55 for a semester parking pass. Arg! O yeh, Rachy told me that she dyed her hair an uh oh color...Blonde! DANGER DANGER! man i guess we just wanted to switch hair colors. We talked about how i ned to ask my friends if we can go there to Englewood, Fl for spring break. I dunno yet. But most special it was mommy and renee's day o' fun! we went and saw the otters at the Newport Aquarium then we ate at joes crab shack.  Good times. My momma is getting major arthritis/who knows what and she's in pain and shrinking to top it off. This sucks Majorly. I guess its bed time now. I so can't wait to visit tommy and he hasn't even left yet,lol, i'm ridiculous, I love that tommy kid, he's "The Shit".

      So for the first time in my life, last night i was trouble.  We had tommy's going away party at my house. I let it be B.Y.O.B. b/c hey i don't serve or drink alcohol but i suppose others could.  I'm real dumb for this i know and you'll read what happened... So we're having a swell ol' time when i see tommy come over and tell me that there are cops outside. Holy shit, i know. And he says it to me again and i know he's not joking. Holy shit again. So i have to go outside and talk to those bitches.  Then i let them in b/c hey its a giant see-through door and yeh they already have seen the underage consumption occur. So they get us in a circle and ask for the drivers ID's and they run them. They also give me and the drivers the light sobriety test.  Luckily, they let everyone go home with a sober driver. I just kept saying, "Holy Fucking Shit I am the freakin luckiest person in the world, Holy fucking shit". Honestly I am. Josh could have been charged with all the underage drinkers for providing them with the beer and I could be charged with hosting it, allowing it to occur, and if anybody had done anything else illegal that would be my ass also. O yeh, the reason they showed up is from a noise violation. Damn neighbors. We were not even loud i swear. and they could have just asked us to turn it down and we would of.  Those cops were soo generous and again Holy fucking shit I am the luckiest person.  Then tiffy and molly came back for their phones and what-not. Nicole was sweet and called to see if i was okay. I'm so glad Tommy came back here. I kept saying "Tommy All I wanted was to give you a good going away party". He said It was waay better than anything he had expected. He said I was "the shit" and his dawg. That made me feel better about it. I swear, he's like a super-cool guy and I'm sad he's leaving.  I'm so gonna go visit him sometime in Louisville. Damn though, the first thing i ever do out of the range of goody-goody, i get majorly busted. Karma is telling me not to do crap like this and trying to teach everybody else who was here the same lesson. I learned. But it still was fun before it ended. Hey I put my ass on the line completely tommy I better be the shit. lol. yeh. I'm So gonna miss you tommy!!! we will party on again one day...soon maybe?

      O boy. Right now that's all i can say. I turned on the T.v. to investigat how the hurricane was doing. To my surprise to see them reporting from basically a wasteland now. Punta Gorda florida was a disaster area. That's aroung where the 15 people died, or so the T.v. tells me. My buddy Rachel lives in englewood. thats like 25 miles from her. I hope they got out safely and that they don't know anybody who got hurt. Man, that has got to be horrible. Be Safe Rachy!  So yeh... what happened to my friends yesterday? they were supposed to come back to my house after they were out "causing trouble". But they never showed up. They didn't even call. so today i have been tired from lack of sleep. I hope Nick wins with his video. I know it will be great because nick is a talented lil' creature and everything he does is great and creative. Lessa's having fun in florida but for now, i feel sick. O boy...

      okay i know my last two responses have been a bit odd but hey thats me.  Tonight is one of the funnest days, Friday the 13th!! I absolutely love this day. I crave the movies and the thrill.  From basically as long as i can remember I have watched horror movies with my sister.  Goodness, its strange but they are always something that tie us together.  She's on her way, or maybe already is in florida.  I hope she has nice weather.  Or at least safe weather.  I don't think she's watching and blood, gore, and chainsaws tonight.  That's okay.  Pickle and I are gonna watch Halloween, One of my absolute fav. movies and my favorite series of horror movie. Good times we have.  Me and Pick have been watching these movies since we were at least 5 years old.  I still remember when she had to go home b/c Cujo became too real.  We were watching and my bro came up behind us and started to bark.  She got scared and went home.  Hey we were tiny so what can you expect from us?  So as far as i can remember horror movies have been awesome and hopefully i will still enjoy the scare when i'm old and gray haired.  Maybe I like them so much because they remind me of the absolute best holiday, HALLOWEEN! okay well my movie is gonna start soon and I'm excited. so yeh ttyl Buhbye!

      today is just an ordinary day so...Here's a fun song by The Postal Service...  Will someone please call a surgeon   Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart   That your're deserting for better company?   I can't accept that it's over...    I will block the door like a goalie tending the net   In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry   So just say how to make it right   And i swear i'll do my best to comply   Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better   Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together   I feel must interject here    you're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself   With these revisions and gaps in history   So let me help  you remember.   I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear.   I've prepared a lecture on why i have to leave   So please back away and let me go   I can't my darling i love you so...   Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better   Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together   Don't you feed me lines about some idealistic future   Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures   I admit that i have made mistakes and i swear   I'll never wrong you again   You've got a lure i can't deny,    But you've had your chance so say goodbye   Say goodbye   Yeh, so i'm still here at pickle's house. She is lounging and its all good.  Wow i swear my dreams are interesting. They always seem real though; showing me the possibilites of what would happen if i were to ever actually take a chance. It's interesting to think about though; how different your life could be if you were to make different choices.  I hate to say it but i wish i wasn't always the good child, ya know.  I have these expectations that I put on myself. They alway seem to be way higher than everyone elses.  I wish I had the ability to let go of what is right and just do somethin recklous and fun; more importantly to be able to just accept the outcome.  Sometimes I envy people like that. They can do whatever they please and they dont care. They DON'T care about what happens next.  They don't seem to mind letting down a good reputation with their parents, or worry about what others will think of them; or do they really care too much and that's why they do it in the first place? I don't have a freakin clue anymore. I have lost my insight to the world.  Perhaps Its my psychological state kicking in.  I just know I have problems. Anxiety Rules my life and it just might forever. That has got to be the reason i care so much about freakishly tiny things.  I'm workin on it. Little by Little. One day I may actually be able to fulfill that ambishion of mine as a stripper! yes! that would be great.      oh yeh this was all brought on by a dream ofo mine remember?   In case you were wondering, it was about a little strip number that i actually might have done! lol o well that shot is over.     okay, thats all i have to confess right now to this great journal thinger here. so if you read this, don't judge me, you only know a sliver of the innerworkings of my mind. You cannot possible understand it all.  O yeh, And i SOOOOOOO wanna see Garden State!!! When is it gonna be here???Arg! I can't wait any longer for it!! kk have a swell day :)

      so.. yeh thats how i'm feeling again. not even able to put three dots behind my so.  I think i'm gonna play with my bestest bud pickle today! we have done stuff for a while now. i don't know why.  I swear sometimes i can't stand myself.  Ever have those moments where you would just rather not exist at all. i do. don't worry i'm not suicidal now but i honestly just wish to vanish.  and it seems to me lately that not that many people would care. Of course my friends, which i seem to be losing all the time, would and people who had seen me or maybe if i'm lucky had actually heard my name would have a slight interest, but my fam. would care.  I feel like i mean nothing.  A wasteful existence.  but what can ya do really.  I have so many problems with myself i think.  I'm sure next year i'll figure myself out.  They say college is a time of self-discovery, maybe i can find myself then.  Again i reiterate there is nothin wrong but...For now I believe in these words from modest mouse, a great band i have you know, shown to me by jake, whom i have not seen but once since he moved to amelia land, anyways here: "I am not who i want to be, i probably will not ever be...I'm in the karma payment plan".

      Right so today is supposed to be my senior picture day but so far i dont think i'm allowed to leave this place. The maintanence men woke me up at 8 and told me i had to move my car. I gave them my mom's keys b/c hey that thing is like ginormous and i can't drive it.  So the weather is sucky lookin and i dont have my clothes ready to go. i don't have stuff together basically. wah. my kitties are finally at peace here though. they are asleep in front of the computer monitor right now, blocking my view as they always appear to be.  I guess right now i should be doing my laundry/showering/cleaning this dump/and other activities, but i'm not. I think it's gonna be another "life, I give up on you today", day.  Which in case you were not familiar with the term means, blah blah and just lay on the bed today. so i'm gonna go to do that now.
