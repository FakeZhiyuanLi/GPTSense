        I've been gifted!  I have been struggling with an idea that came to me for a book colaberation with my sister, and this morning, while watching Metallica on Head Banger's Ball, it came to me!  Can't wait to write it out!     Another exciting revelation is that Metallica has a movie coming out in theaters in a couple weeks! It's called "Some Kind of Monster"!  I was bouncing in my seat at the news!  Well, time to don a ponytail and running shoes to run with Madre !  3.5 miles this morning.

        Ah, the Nike shoe.  I sing its praises!  The new pair I own are absolutely wonderous!  My feet have been converted to Nike-ism from the cultish Avia organization.  I have witnessed to my family and have made believers of my father and sister.  Both have tried on my shoes, and as soon as their feet slid inside, their raptorous expressions told me that their soles had been comforted.  Though my dad's feet were a bit too big to fit properly, trying on my shoe made him want to convert from his long time alliance with New Balance, and my sister is converting from her support of Adidas.     Oh, ho, ho brother. I enjoy my shoes, but I really didn't intend to write that bit of evangalistic advertising for Nike.  It just started, and I had fun writing it. (shrug)   I went to Hot Topic and bought laces to go with my shoes for the Fun Run in Austin at the end of August.  I got pink cammoflage to match my pink and silver Nike Shox.  They say, yeah, I may be wearing pink, but I'm no delicate flower.  Well, maybe they don't.  I just thought they'd look cool.  Actually I laced up one of my shoes, and the laces are just barely long enough.  You can't hardly tell it's a cammoflage theme.  Oh well.     Another thing I wanna wear in the run is a pink and white ball cap with a pink Superman symbol on the front.  Or would it be Superwoman?  I may end up getting the hat tomorrow.     I am so looking forward to the run!  My sister and future bro-in-law will be there!  There's gonna be a free concert and they're trying to get in the Guiness Book for the most clowns gathered for an event.  Most runners will be in costume.  I'll be in pink.

        Well, 'tis the 4th of July, and I'm celebrating by sipping on a Michelob Ultra, and typing words out into space.  Actually, I celebrated earlier by meeting a bunch of people I don't know, who used their powers of persuasion and a frozen margarita to get me to play Twister with them.  Well, no that's wrong.  Those people didn't persuade me.  My cousin Eric did, by asking me politely.  I accompanied Eric tonight, because he wanted to know if a girl he likes is playing games with him.  He thought that if I was there, I could observe and be able to tell him what's going on in her mind.  Of course I can.  I didn't have to observe for long.     This young lady, is most definitely playing games.  She laid on the flirting pretty big tonight, however, when questioned this morning about her feelings, she replied that she didn't know if she liked him or not.  Brother.  I don't like this girl.  Eric may be a crazy monkey at times (and loveabley so), but he's a grown-up, and this girl isn't.  Oh, ages!  I should mention that I am the oldest of the group at 26.  Eric is 24 next month and I think his interest is around 22.  Well, to continue, I'll correct myself by saying that I don't dislike her.  It's just that she's wrong for Eric.  It'll take up too much space for me to give reasons why.   Anyhow, I was asked to play Twister and so I slipped off my sandals, rolled up the legs of my jeans a bit, and stood ready.  After all, I'm a flexible person, I could do well in the game if I wanted, but not a minute into the game, I didn't want to.  I was uncomfortabley close to a guy I wasn't impressed with.  On right foot red, he turned to me and said "Uh-oh, someone's going to get an ass in the face!"  I thought, "The hell I am." and faked a fall on my butt.  The last thing I'll do is willingly tolerate someone's ass in my face.   Well, after that I had dinner with the group, and played a game of Taboo before I left.  Eric walked me to the car.  We're making plans to hang out in a couple weeks.  Also, there are plans for us to go Houston on Aug. 6th, to meet with my sister and her fiance to go the Evanescence concert in the Woodlands.  I don't have much in the way of concert clothes, so I went to Hot Topic yesterday and got an asymetrical, blue and black shirt with a silver skull and cross bones on one shoulder.  I think that, with black pants and black shoes, should put me in proper concert mode.  Well, my headache's getting bigger and the alcohol didn't help.  TTFN!
