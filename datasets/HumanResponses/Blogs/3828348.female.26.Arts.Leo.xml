      I enjoyed the visit to New Mexico incredibly lots! It was a trip with lots of activities and curious things I never seen before! We were driving in the middle of the desert when the storm came to us and not a single person around us... Before that, we stop to take this picture of the only vertical object I found on the horizon... A small house - toilet looking - in the middle of nowhere... Love it! Places where the time stops...  urlLink     Boarding Pass

                     This is a little tiny  correction for my previous blog for those who like to spot mistakes when a brain  is about to collapse when is writing. When I write "Scavenger's Hunt of last  night" I meant... -&gt; Scavenger's hunt of last YEAR! Got to remember what I  did last night and why is it so subliminal!! hahaha!!!     *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *    &nbsp;    Art is the human behaviour -   www.juliana.nu   http://julianaforero.blogspot.com/

      One of my very favorites!!! Here it comes!!! Almost a year ago I took this pic in New Mexico! Que cosa tan bacana, oiga!? The desert was just mine (should I say the dessert? :D) I printed this picture to Pablo, another artist and friend who seems to like this print very much, I also give away another print in the Scavengers Hunt of last night... so if the person who took it recognize it... it certainly needs a signature -> mine!! I travelled with my boyfriend Serge, and it was such a great trip! I loved it! I am starting to feel that pictures calls my eyes whenever they want to be shot. (is there another verb for that?) Quien sabra? Quizas Mandrake, no? A ver a ver!?  urlLink     Boarding Pass

      Ladies and gentlemen... Let me introduce to you... my mom!!!  We traveled north to West Palm Beach to do some work there, and.. I found the beach sooo appealing that I asked her to walk with me there... As usual I had my camera  on me so she posed for me... And here it is... One year later, almost exactly ;) enjoy!  urlLink     Boarding Pass

      I thought I published this photo earlier but... I don't see it... so, here it goes again!!! Tomorrow I will be flying to New York City... so the immediate effect is that I won't be able to publish any photographs while I am gone... ("nomada" my computer will relax at home ;) ) But the effect at the LONG TERM effect is that most probably I will come with many interesting pictures to publish! So.... this 'suffering' is for the best of all ;) hehe... This photo has enlighten many people's browser, yet I am still publishing it here because many others haven't seen it yet.... mmm... I don't remember over which sky I took this pic, most probably over New Mexico... Enjoy my Window Seat Pic.. for the n time! "I'll be back!"  urlLink     Boarding Pass

      One day I went with my friend Lina to the Main Library, and I loved the view from the elevator, so simple, geometric and very difficult to avoid the simetry... so I took several pictures of the parking lot and this is the one I love the most from that day.

      One day I was taking out Tomas (my dog... or should I say the dog of the family...) for a walk, when I saw this egg laying in the ground. There are always ducks walking around my house and this egg was sooo much inviting me to take a picture, like posing, that I had to run back home and grab the camera (hoping no animal would eat it first).. What happened with it afterwards? Well, perhaps he was never born, perhaps he did and it's walking around my house, it might went flying somewhere less hot... I hope it didn't went exploring the shadow of a car - like many of the ducks here do, and then end up visiting places unvoluntarily with it.  urlLink     Boarding Pass

      Ahhh... 2 weeks ago I went to New York City for the first time... I loved it! This is the Hudson river from New Jersey with Manhattan in the back... Looks like the path to success (LOL!).  The next week I will be exploring the lands of the Grand Canyon in Arizona and Utah, so, again, I won't be able to publish any new photography until I come back from there. Most probably next week... I hope you enjoy the ones that are already published. I am going to miss this blog for a little while... I am getting used to this duty of posting one photography everyday...

      Can it be more convenient? After hours of driving in the desert and no tree to hide, you find this practical portable toilet that will provide you personal satisfaction and relief in the more harsh conditions. My personal satisfaction was to take a photograph of it and smile all the way to the Hotel due to the discovery :) Desert in New Mexico.  urlLink     Boarding Pass

I am turning one year old today, thought if you think properly.. it was  during a year that tonight after 2 hours of August 4th. I am one year older and  I feel good about it. I have many things going on and among my gifts I saw an  ironing board and a microwave -&gt; I am moving alone in the next 2 weeks and I  have to buy many household items, as well as packing many things!!! Life is  great and has to be lived -&gt; I change my motto everyday, but basically I keep  smiling at life because it has been great.      &nbsp;    So, keep on visiting my pages and  don't forget you can post your comments as anonymous if you don't want to  register with the blog people.      &nbsp;    Keep on smiling, I say      &nbsp;    Happy Birthday to me!      &nbsp;     &nbsp;    *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *    &nbsp;    Art is the human behaviour -   www.juliana.nu   http://julianaforero.blogspot.com/

      What can I say! It would be impossible if the people around me wouldn't be part of what I do somehow. Usually my family and friends are behind the shooting (usually because I don't want them to mess us my idea :D, or I need them to push some algas on the sea for a video :D - I know I sound evil :D ), but as much as we love eachother they ARE the subject of many of my photographs and I couldn't be more proud to show you my boyfriend for the past 5 years: Serge, in this picture. This one was shot one year ago on the trip we did to New Mexico. On one of the dunes of White Sands here he is. And well, for the many people who have heard of him.. well, here it is a tiny look! jaja  urlLink     Boarding Pass
