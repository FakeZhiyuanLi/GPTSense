      Not much went on today, did some shopping with my mom, and finished a huge cleaning spree that I was on. I cleaned out my pantry, and took the extras to the Food Pantry. I stood in line for like 10 minutes with two brown grocery bags full of food for donations.  There are like 5 old lady's that didn't even notices and told me to go ahead and grab like sandwiches or something. I didn't catch it because I started laughing at her. I said," NO, NO, I am hear to donate this food that I am holding" "Ohhhh"" She says, "I didn't notice". How could you not notice.  It was funny.    So today, I got some really great news my friend Christine. She is coming from Florida to visit. She said she is coming to stay with me. I love having her around. I really miss her.  She is bringing her new beau. I love that girl to death, but she has the worst taste in men.  (no offense Chris) So this guy aught to be interesting.  Watched my new favorite show, quintuplet, on Fox. That show is hilarious, my favorite character is played by  urlLink Ryan Pinkston , The kid from punked and soul plane, that kid just steals the show.   Tomorrow, is my hard work out day from that crazy instructor at West Wood. I've been working out everyday this week at west Wood, and lifting some weights, so I won't be so sore this time. Well wish me luck I have to wake up before nine tomorrow. Ouch!

      I am in so much pain today. I was going to go swim, but the weather is really cool.  I am having a little bit of trouble getting around today due to my excessive lifting yesterday. Just laying low tonight, watch movies and grill out some steaks. Tomorrow, I have to use my muscles again, to help my sister move her stuff. (Not looking forward to it)  But I am forceing myself to at least walk today, because I know it'll make the soarness better.  Tomorrow, I am heading out to sumerfest with my friend Angela and her boyfriend Kyle. They are so much fun to out with, we always have a good time.  Hopefully it'll be a great weekend, weather wize.

      I woke up early today, 8:30!! WOW, it was really yucky out, but I slammed a sugarless red bull and headed to meet my friend Pam at West Wood.  I took this strength training class with Patty, OH MY GOD!! That is the best class ever, I have never done cardio and weight strengthen all my muscles in 1 hour, it was great. I would suggest everyone try it. Then I picked up my kid, and visited with my sister. I am really starting to feel this workout this mourning. It hurts just to bend my hamstring to sit. Started ordering books today for the Fall semester, it'll be here in no time. Hopefully tomorrow it will be nice so that I can go to the lake and swim a couple of miles. I should really do a mild workout after the one today.

      Didn't do alot today, Woke up watched days and worked out at West Wood.  I feel like just watching movies, it is just nasty outside today.  Last night I watched  urlLink Bad Santa , wow, that was hilarious, that kid Thurman is just so funny. So is  urlLink Lauren Graham , I don't think I can ever watch Gilmore Girls again, without thinking, "Fuck Me Santa"(that is what she says in the movie) I did get my first reading assingment from Carroll College. I have to read a book called " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" by Philip K. Dick. And I have to go to class a day early to talk about it. I plan on making a trip to the bookstore next week. I hope that used books are still available. Still looking for a joby job!

      Not much going on today, I watched my youngest nephew for a couple of hours. So that my sister could pack up some stuff from her old apartment.  He was great, we went on a car ride, I had to run some errands. Every time I would stop the car, that kid went crazy. (What a set of lungs) As soon as I started driving again he'd take a nap. Very smart for 3 months.  Cleaned my balcony today and laid outside in my big floppy hat that I love. I hate tanning my face, but love getting my legs nice and tan. Not a bad set up on my porch, My lay out chair, and a little 19inch TV (with cable that I rigged).  Today was perfect for it. Tomorrow I am going to get my $20 season pass for Ottawa Lake, so that I can do my swim across the lake.

      This weekend was incredably long. Carl's 1st annual lucky Fest didn't go as expected, but I told him to be hopeful for next year. Friday, I had a little too much drink, but met some pretty cool people at the festival. Saturday, I slept as much as I could only 5 Hours then I ran some errands and headed back to Lucky's Fest. Saturday I brought my sister, And she had a lot of fun. She had some PDA going on with one of my friends. They kept thanking me for introducing them to one another. It was hilarious. At First she was mad at me, I kept telling her about my friend how nice he is, and cute, blah, blah. She kept insisting that she doesn't want to meet anyone, because she had a bad breakup recently, blah, blah. Then I introduced them and the first word out of her mouth is" HI, I'm sady, and I am single!". They actually had their first date yesterday. I love playing match maker. Yesterday, I relaxed all day, cleaned and caught up on sleep. Two days of drinking and partying really takes a toll on you. Well my job searchs continues. I had an interview today, but it didn't go very well. I really need to find a job soon, to save up some money for books. I want to get books for school before the end of june so that I can get the used ones. I am excited about starting school. I can't beleive I am going back to school September 1.

      I spent the day with the family yesterday, Posted pictures above... I went to my moms house, where my sister and my two newphews are also staying.  I also found out that my sister is going to buy the house next door to my moms house. Which at least I don't have to travel far to  visit my family.  Had lunch and dinner over there. LOVE, Love Love my mom's cooking. What is it about mom's cooking that is so great. I can make the same receips at home but they never taste the same.  Well today is another busy day.  I have to go to my mom's run some errands, and then be back and ready by five to go to the first annual  urlLink lucky's Fest .  Well hope everyone has a great weekend

      During Days I saw the greatest commercial for  urlLink Seasonale  I made an appointment with my doctor for two weeks. This would really help my decision in going to the peace corps. I was really worried about having my period in a foreign country. With Seasonale you only have 4 periods a year. WOW!! I am so at peace about this.   This weekend is  urlLink Lucky's Fest , the first ever. Carl is pretty nervous, since this is the first big schindig he has put on for his bar. Please feel free to come down and listen to some bands  urlLink Cherry Pie , and  urlLink Bob Rocks . My favorite beer is hosting BUD, Yeah!! There is a huge beer tent, and of course Carl's bar Lucky's will be hosting food. It should be fun! Hope to see some people I like to drink with there.

      So, this is my first blog!!  A lot of things that I have been thinking about. Today I added an extra class at Carroll I want to graduate as soon as possible. I have been thinking about joining the peace corps.  Last week I had this very interesting dream and I have been so happy ever since.  I have always felt like I have been settling because I really didn't know what I wanted.  I had my sister interpret the dream (yes, my sister interprets dream & she has a physic) According, to my sister the dream I had meant that I have had an eyeing opening experience and I can get to where I want to be if I keep trying.  I don't want to get into the specific of the dream, because it was really weird. Well anyway, for some reason I started thinking about the Peace Corps, I have been researching it like crazy. I am going to check out some meetings this summer in Minnesota, or Chicago.  I really have my heart set on going to Africa.  When I told Carl(my live in Boyfriend) he just laughs and shrugs his shoulders "Like you could ever do without shopping". That just makes me want to do it even more.  Ever since I've had this dream I see the road I have to take to get to where I want to be.(Without sounding too corny)  It's going to take some sacrifices, but I really think it will be worth it. After that I want to move to London. Weird I know, but for some reason my heart is set on moving there too. It will take a long time, but I just feel like I am working towards something. I haven't really worked towards anything in 5 years. It's just living pay check to pay check and finding another dumb job just to pay the bills. As soon as I graduate I will have something to start a career right?? I Hope so...

      Can't wait untill this weekend, Lots of stuff going on I will hopefully be done moving back into my dad's house by Friday. Slowly but surely doing it. This Saturday at 1pm, my sister from florida is comming for a visit.&nbsp; Hany, I love Hany. The only thing that sucks when all three sister get together is that two of us always gang up on one another. And at first the two of them will gang up on me becaus I am the youngest and the Hany and I will gang up on Sady because she is the oldest/says stupid shit sometimes. We always give her shit that she will get old and ugly first.  Then something will happen where we will all fight against each other or all together against someone else.&nbsp;  It always happens , in a two-three day period, en0ugh drama for the year. It'll be nice to see my sister Hany again, and it'll be espically nice for all of of to be togethe again. My sister Hany is bringing me some really nice Chanel glasses. I am totally excited about that.&nbsp; On Sunday we are all getting pierced together.&nbsp; NO matter how old you get you can never out grow your sisters.

      After all my bitching and neglect at home. I am finally making the proper steps to leave Carl once and for all. I have made arrangements with my dad and the UHAUL people. I am going to do this. It kinda sucks, because I know I will miss him.&nbsp; It has been five years. But the last year has really sucked ass.  Reasons for leaving...  1. Works 7 days a week, all day and all night, and some how we are not rich. ( A little suspicious)  2. My Birthday sucked ass because of him, ON my birthday, he couldn't hang out with me because he had softball. and on my birthday weekend party, where all my friends, were going to get together for my birthday carl wouldn't go because he had to work, but would let me drink for free at his bar.  3. Secret life, Carl has a tendency to leave out things that he does through out the day. Even if they are work realted, he never mentions anything.( I have to listen to his voicemail messages just to know what is going on with his life)  4. Something is always happening. Somehow on his way of way to somewhere Carl always runs into someone, something. That always delays him, Hence, can never commit to anything because of this.  5. Neglect, This is the big one. When Carl is not working &nbsp;7 days a week, During the fall he must go hunting from Friday after work untill Sunday night from September to January.&nbsp; Anytime I want him to be with me It is like pulling teeth, because there is always something else to do besides me. This August 27th is Bear Hunting season in Maine. Carl has never taken me anywhere nice for vacation(we went to Vegas once, but that trip was on his dad) I have asked him not to go, but he claims that he would rather spend time with his brothers. And he never gets to do anything for himself, which is true, but he never gets to do anything with me either.  6. Carl and I don't even sleep together sometimes, we will go in spurts of months not sleeping together, he falls asleep on the couch. ( I do not miss him either)  7. He never surprises, I know that this is a girly theory, but I really beleive that if I were to get a hello phone call of just a simple I love you phone call&nbsp; everything wouldn't feel so empty all the time. Plus I can predict everything he does and how situations will end. Usually me getting hurt.  If Carl fucks up on something instead of comming home right away he just figures hey I already fucked so what is the use of trying Since I know this is how he thinks, hence never surprised.  8.Cheated on me. About two years ago he kissed some girl&nbsp;and was talking with her behind my back for like a month. Which at his time we were engaged and put deposits down on a reception hall, making up guest list, picking out wedding party people. During this whole time, yup talking to another girl.&nbsp; (During this time it was my birthday, and on my birthday called other girl before he even called me to wish me a happy birthday, I checked the cell phone bills)As much as he did apologize and crawl up my ass for it, I have never forgiven him for it.&nbsp;I always check all his calls, voicemails ,mail. Time of arrival and departure where ever he goes. And to tell you the truth I am exhausted. This is something that I&nbsp; know I won't miss. &nbsp;  9. He likes to throw money at me. Anytime he does something wrong, which is a lot of times. He often gives me money to make me feel better and buy myself something nice. Then when i get upset for whatever reason he says" Well, I gave you money for ......"  10. Forgot our five year anniversary. Did not even call me to say hi, or wish me a happy anniversary. I took off and partied in the dells on our anniversary he never said anything about it.  I could go on and on, on all the bull shit he has put me through, but I just don't think I need anymore&nbsp; reassurance from myself anymore. There are so many reasons that are a little more personal that I don't even want to get into it or remeber for that matter.  Thanks Shannon for always listening, I might need you more than ever.  This is most definately the right thing for me to do.&nbsp; So off to dads house I go.   &nbsp;

      Read my horoscope yesterday, it read" Beware of money problems"  So today I find out I don't get paid untill next week. OUCH!,  Today is my newphew's &nbsp;9th Birthday, he is gettting so old.   I also , Have an interview, for a job, i will most likely turn down, do to my scheduling conflicts. (School)  Wednesday, was my mom's birthday, my sister and I took her to the great Cuban restaurant, it was great. As a Cuban-American, I would have to say that the food was really authentic, and tasted great.  urlLink Cubanitas , Just like mom use to make.&nbsp; After dinner, we took my mom to Potowatomi, she has never gambled before in her life, my mom has just turned 51. (my mom was married to my dad for 15 years, and are very strict Mormons)  My mom had so much fun. She gambled on a nickle machine on $20 for 4 1/2 hours.&nbsp; I lost all my money in 20min.   Just to let everyone know about this blog  urlLink joemygod.blogspot.com   This is the best writing ever. Everytime I read one of his stories, it's like I am there watching what is going on. The only thing I hate about this blog is that he stops writing &nbsp;when it is getting good, and says "TO BE CONTINUED" I get so mad, I swear I will never read it again, but check back every hour to the hour until a couple of days later he updates Damn you Joemygod.&nbsp; I suspect that this person is a writer in life there is no way that someone with that much talent doesn't write everyday.  Well just wanted to bring it everyone's attention.   ANGELA:: You should call me!! Don't be pissed!  And for Shannon's mom, she is doing great, alright for Shannon's Mom!!

Ran into this little fabulous store called  urlLink Torrid .&nbsp; i Bought some really gorgous cluby cloths, for this weekend, that's if i go. Lots of things have changed for my plans this weekend (dells trip) usually that is&nbsp; not a good sign, but either way i have a cute new top and a cute new poncho/shaw, that I bought. Not to expensive either. usually when you get into plus sizes they rape you in price.&nbsp; today is a big tv night, simple life 2, quintaplets, and newlyweds/ashlee simpson show is on. I am planning on folding cloths during these show.&nbsp; i was so busy doing deep cleaning for christine's visit I&nbsp;ran behind on laudry about two weeks worth. Lots of folding, (the two biggest chores i hate are laudry and dishes(it never stops) and is never caught up.  I am really starting to become addicted to the show Nip/Tuck, that show just rocks, and who wouldn't want to see  urlLink Julian McMahon  naked he is so hott!!!! best of luck tomorrow shannon, don't forget to call if you want about absolutely anything, and gage is absolutely gorgous, don't forget to send me some more pictures.

      Slept all afternoon and night on Friday, and went out again, on Saturday.  I met Christine at Timers , Milwaukee. We had such a good time. Carl, really wants me to go to Florida to visit Christine. He makes it sound like he is doing it for me. But i know he just offered to pay for my trip so that He can also go on vacation to Maine to go bear hunting. Unfortunately the dates he wants to go are 3 days before school starts. I am not going to do anything to jeopardize my first couple days of school.&nbsp; Yesterday, my sister and I went swimming at Ottawa Lake. I had a good time. I was super hung over , and my sister was drinking. Man was she annoying.&nbsp; I wasn't in the moood to babysit her ass. She kept messing with me, pointing at me and siting a couple of inches from me, saying&nbsp;"I'm not touching you". She did this for like 20 minutes. She kept saying "how do you like it". Because I guess back when were kids I use to do this.&nbsp; Which is probably true, but that was when I was 6-8 years old. My sister is 29 years old. I think she should have just let it go by now.&nbsp; ( I beleive that Sunny D commercial brought back old memories) Anway the point is, she really annoyed me.&nbsp; We would up fighting like when we were kids, punching and kicking, and pulling my hair. That bitch. We made some dinner and watched a movie together last night. I love my sister, she is my best friend, but I really wasn't in the mood for drunkness, after I was already carrying a hang over since Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christine is still in town untill Tuesday. I will post some pictures from our weekend, later this week.  &nbsp;

      Christine arrived around 11pm last night. I was just going to say hi and then go to bed, I was so beat. One thing led to another and we were up untill 5am catching up.&nbsp; And of course we brought out the beer, and booze. Between me and her we went throught a twelve pack and a couple drinks of brandy and coke. We really missed each other, we were up talking about everything we've missed in each others lives in the last year.&nbsp; I am at work today woke up at 7:45 and made it to work on time I am a little out of it, and having trouble consintrating, but at least I can go home and catch some zzzzzz. Christine has to go to a wedding tonight she has a couple more days of drinking, i guess that is ok when you are on vacation. I will post some pictures of my friend Christine and her sister Katie. Her boyfriend Dario, is alright looking, but she seems different around him. I will know more, when I get to know him this weekend. Good Luck to Shannon!, Your mom is on my mind. And see you at Italien Fest Angela!

Talk to my Christine today, she left Florida at noon. And she is driving to Atlanta and staying at her moms house. Then she is leaving early mourning tomorrow, and it's about a 12hour drive from georgia to Wisconsin. I can't wait to see her. My job really sucks by the way. I hate being a receptionist, but at least it's a paycheck. Only 1month and a half till I am once again a full time college student Yea!

      Had an ok day at my new job! The company is a little behind times, since my computer at work does not have the internet> And only two people at a time can be online. I thought that was hilarious.  No biggy since I am on the computer at home all the time.  I am sure only Shannon Will notice, me not emailing her all day. But don't worry shannon, school will start school and i'll be online during the day again. This should make your workday go faster. Well my position, kinda sucks, but hey it's a job. I really hate greeting people. Went to the gym after work, felt kinda lazy today, so I didn't lift any weight, just 30min of cardio and some ab work. Heard from Christine that she is leaving floriday tomorrow night. Gave her directions to my house. I haven't actually talk to her on the phone for a while. WoW She is getting a southern accent. If she pronounces Wisconsin, messed up I might have to hang up on her( Just kidding Chris) Well I have a lot to do today still cleaning up my guest room and bathroom for Chris. Plus I have to go grocery shopping, I plan on going out in Milwaukee this weekend with Christine since she is from Milwaukee, we might Wind up going on thursday To UW Whitewater bars, we both you to go there. Who know how fun it will be since it is summer.  But there is always something fun and cheap to do there. Get a hold of me If anyone wants to meet up this weekend, and meet my friend.

      Went out last night with my sister for some drinks.  She was in search of a man. It was amazing that all the bars in Oconomowoc were full of men.  She wound up hitting on some really old guy that is about 65 and looks like Jack Nicholson. Amazing what beer googles will make you see.  The guy was really ugly. Anyway, I am not feeling to good today, I had way too many drinks.  My mom wanted to play tennis today, and I am glad a thunderstorm is comming because I dont think I'd do very well.   Went to see the Notebook, it was exactly what I wanted very romantic, and of course I cried.  Well nothing exciting going on this weekend, except I have to do some major cleaning, my friend Christine will be here, less than a week.  I am excited about the following weekend.  This Saturday, I am going out with Miguel, and my sister. I always have a great time when I go out with Miguel , he loves giving straigt men blow jobs.  He is the minster of gay men. Loves going out to straight bars to see how many he can turn. (You'd be surprised) It's quite hilarious.

      Didn't do much of anything exciting today, cleaned up and then went to the gym. I lifted a little extra today, due to not working out on the 5 or 6th. Now I am kinda sore. But I am sure I'll feel better tomrrow. I applied for 15 Jobs this mourning, hopefully one will call me back.  Watched the movie the Butterfly effect. I thought the director's cut was really amazing.  Still waiting to see the Secret Window, with Johnny Depp, and I want to go the movie theater and see The Notebook, I read like half the book a couple of years ago. It was ok, what I remeber of it anyway. I am most definately ready for a little romance movie.

      Friday, Don't I love Fridays. I get to wear jeans at work and today, I am done at 2:30 because I have an interview , wish me luck. I hope I get a position.  My temp job is just about done. I only have two more weeks here. Last night I watched Seabiscuit, what a great movie, i teared a little. And of course i watched the secound to last show of days before the olympics. man oh man things are getting good, except for the fact that jennifer has been pregnant for 11months on the show.   Didn't get started on my project again, but I plan on it tonight.  I really have to clear out my bedroom, it looks so clutter at the moment.  I kinda started looking at cloths that I want to give away/throw out, but then I stopped and just left it there, my plan is to get it all done through out the weekend, and clean out my room to make room for some bedroom furniture that I bought. This weekend, I am dyeing my hair, hopefully it wil come out good, other wise, I will always dye it back a brown. Tonight, Is pizza night at my house, and Camille wants to watch Teenage conffessions of a Drama Queen(i think that is the title) This should be interesting. And i want to watch 13 going on 30. We'll see, might watch both through out the weekend.

      So, another day at my job, reading Harry Potter 4. What a great kid book. I can't wait til the movie comes out.  I picked up Camille yesterday and went to see Princess Diaries 2, it was OK. I think the first one was better. Camille really enjoyed it, she said it was the best movie ever.   We had some diner at Martys,and then went to the movies. We got home around 9.  Then I showed Camille how to clean out her hamster cage, because frankly I am sick of doing it . I clean it out 2 a week, because if i even smell it I will freak out.  Anyway, she forgets that Usher even exist(hamster) I am really tring to teach her to clean up after herself, because I am just getting sick of picking up after people. I mean how hard is to take off you cloths and put in the hamper. Or how hard is to have a soda and when you are done with put it in the garbage. I mean, i do stuff like this all day, just to keep the house clean. Carl has to be the worst.  we use different bathrooms. And I wanted to see how long it would  before he picked up his pile of cloths from the floor in the bathrrom and put in the hamper, it went a whole week-Mon-Fri, and he still just moved it over. I mean YUCK! He is the worst piggy of all.  Well not much going on today.  I do have a big project that I want to start maybe today. I am going to start going through my cloths and giving away my old stuff, I have way to much cloths, and it's really old stuff that I know I will never wear again.  This project will take me all weekend.

      Wow, what an episode of Nip/Tuck last night. THat was a good one, the only the thing that pissed me off was when the lesbian got an abortion. I am very much pro-choice, but after going through all that trouble of getting pregnant, and then talking to the stigmata girl, why in the fuck would have have an abortion then.  That was stupid. I think becuase she didn't want a kid with some sort of dissability.  As a mother, it wouldn't matter to me.  Kids are something  you fall in love with as soon as you know they exist. I am thinking the person that wrote the episode could not possibly have kids.  Nice episode thou.  So today I am taking it easy at work, Bought Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (4th book) Prett y good book. I've been reading it all mourning, I am on Chpater 8 by noon.  I know that it is a kids book, but I love the witch &amp; wizard stuff. One of my favorite shows is Charmed. Not much going on today, I have to pick up Camille at 4pm from her dads. She will be a little surprised to see her bed is missing, I moved it when I was moving out, now I have to somehow get back in the next couple of days I am sure she won't mind, since she loves sleeping in the living room watching the big T.V

      Noting going on today, at my stupid temp job which I hate. The days seem to be getting longer here.  Went to the wake last night, very uncomfortable feeling. Carl went to the funeral today. Carl also woke up with my flu that I had last week. HAHAHAH!! It sucks too.  August seems to be  going by really fast for me.  Only three more weeks here at my temp job and then back to school.  Nothing going on tonight either, I am going home and watching days, quitapulets, and of course NIP/TUCK, hopefully Christian will get naked again. YUMMY!!!!  He is so gorgous. It should be an interesting episode tonight. Still having a hard time finding a job. I have two interviews this week tomorrow and Friday. Wish me luck

      So, I am back with Carl, all the drama, and the depression for nothing. I guess I can't live without him, and he can't live without me. He begged me to stay and even shed a tear.  He promised that he would lay off the working and apologized.  He is planning on taking us on vacation pretty soon here to go somewhere.  He said he missed me and he is doing this for us. At this point I felt kinda bad about all the drama, because he has his prioritys on straight.  This weekend my best friend uncle died, just out of the blue very weird. I have to go to a wake tonight.  I feel extra bad because my same friends anut passed away out of the blue also about 1 year ago, and now her husband passed.  Very strange just to go like that they weren't very old either, in their mid 50's.  I talk to Brad this weekend, just to get a males prepictive this weekend, and this is when I felt like an asshole because his uncle passed away.  He kinda thanked me because he wanted to get his mind off things.  Love ya Brad!
