      The last message I realise was worthy of being turned into a book. However, I promise to keep this post quite short (in comparison!).  This is just a little message to shout out Wa Hooo! I added a counter to my blog for curiosity sake and today it recorded the 100th visitor to my blog since last week. That's an achievement and I am very proud of it! I would like to thank ...........     (SHUT UP OH ANCIENT ONE!!!)     Ok, sorry!  Good night all!

       I have taken this diary directly from the   urlLink VSO website  . It highlights the issues that other countries have in regards to education. Andrew Lincoln is a very attractive actor who played the part of "Simon" a young and reckless English teacher in the Channel 4 series   "Teachers".    &nbsp; Read what happened when Andrew Lincoln, from Channel 4's Teachers was invited to Ghana by VSO to experience at first-hand the real work of VSO teachers and their colleagues, as part of the Valuing Teachers campaign.  Popping a couple of immodium in to my mouth and feeling decidedly worse for wear, I took a slug of water and squinted along the horizon. As the Land Rover hit another pot-hole I winced and turned to Katrina in the back."How many VSO's does it take to fix a light bulb?"The reply was cautious."I don't know. How many VSO's does it take to fix a light bulb?"I stifled a belch,"What light bulb?"I had just spent the night deep under cover in the African bush with two volunteers Ross and Steve. They had no electricity, no running water and a hole in the ground that bore only the slightest resemblance to a toilet.We were driving along one of the worst stretches of roads in the upper west region of Ghana. We'd travelled over 2000 miles, visited five schools, met and shared beers with more than 20 volunteers and had very little sleep. I was coming to the end of one of the exhilarating, awe-inspiring and profound weeks of my life.The idea for the trip had formed two months earlier in the twisted imagination of VSO. The theory was this; the anti-authoritarian but passionate character I play in the Channel 4 series, Teachers mirrored the type of volunteer teacher that VSO recruits to work overseas. Even the pub scenes were apparently identical to the conversations being had by VSOs all over the world, just with warmer beer, more mosquitoes and the occasional power cut.That being the case, I was invited to experience first hand what being a volunteer means. It was tenuous but I was intrigued.Then I discovered that a friend I hadn't seen for three years and the daughter of my mother's oldest and dearest friend was stationed in Ghana and had been teaching English for VSO for a year and a half.News quickly reached me that my friend Laura Smith was in one of the remotest placements VSO had, the Upper West region of Ghana in a tiny village called Kaleo Wa. It would take two days to reach her by car as internal flights were reserved for government officials and big business - Don't they know who I am?Filming flew by and before I knew it I was standing in the Ghanaian embassy waiting for my visa. The wait would have been a little less tedious if the official behind the counter hadn't have found my real name, Clutterbuck so ridiculously amusing. My sense of humour had temporarily failed due to the dull pain in both my arms from the five injections I'd received the day before. I felt like a walking pin cushion.So, at 10.00 pm, I lay in bed the night before my African adventure. My mosquito repellant, factor 28 sunblock and Lynx deodorant (African scent of course) already packed, I began my diary. Just so you know, I'd bought a very nice albeit quite camp travel journal to log the journey.All the volunteers without fail thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen, but undeterred, I stuck to my guns and would excuse myself every night at a civilized hour, retire to my bedroom and record the day. Well that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  Saturday 19 January My nerves have set in and I'm finding it difficult to sleep. Just watched a fascinating and frank VSO tape about Ghana.Modern day Ghana makes for unsettling reading. In a country where over 60% of the population are subsistence farmers, most of the spending seems to be focused in urban areas. Here are a selection of other facts that shocked me:  enrolment in primary education - Ghana 43.4%, UK 99.9%  public expenditure on health - Ghana $4 per capita, UK $1,366 per capita  50% of deaths in Ghana are children in a population where 20% are children. Most of the deaths are preventable diseases ie malaria  200 people are infected with the HIV virus every day.  That's a conservative estimate foreign aid to Ghana - $38 per capita.  Ghana's external debt - $360 per capita   With all of these crippling facts it comes as no surprise that there are many non-governmental organisations operating in Ghana today. They are all principally focused on development of agriculture, education and health.All of my exposure to workers in charities over the past few weeks has inspired me. I've entered through doorways into vast bunkers, with people working for very little pay, some for no pay at all on phone lines, postal deliveries, advertising and education. There is a resolve, responsibility, fierce determination and quiet pride in all of the people I have met.This is going to be an extraordinary experience. Who knows that the next few days will hold. I feel humbled and ignorant, probably the perfect place to learn and hopefully begin to understand a country I have probably spoken about a handful of times in my 28 years.Bring it on!  Sunday 20th January Before boarding the plane I buy a bottle of Gordons Gin, the suggested present for the Chief of Kaleo Wa. I thought the picture of the Beefeater was a nice touch.On the flight out, I sat next to Charles, a business man who worked for Ashanti Gold in Kumasi. Every five or so minutes during the showing of Captain Corelli's Mandolin he would take his earphones off and tell me about his country. I learnt about its geography, economy, the forty or more tribes and even a few phrases in Twi the major language spoken in Ghana. Despite this, I was still able to follow the film.Oh, my word! The heat! As I walked down the steps on to the tarmac my brain naturally justified the warmth as heat emitted from the engine. But as I walked further away it became hotter, wetter and more smothering. It was 28Â°C, so humid you could feel water droplets in the air, and 10.30 pm Ghana time.The airport was chaos. I attached myself, or rather, a porter attached himself to me at baggage collection. I had suddenly become ridiculously over-excited. Every time I've been to Africa in the past the energy of the place and its people intoxicated me and this was no exception. My friend from London, Chewy, while working with him in a play called Blue Orange had taught me the West African handshake. This involves a normal shake - usually held for a lot longer in Ghana - then a slow drag away of the hands and finally a click of both greeters index fingers - very cool to watch and do!What with the handshake coupled with the fact that it's an insult to not stop and chat if someone introduces himself to you, progress out of the airport was slow.Still buzzing from the airport. I got chatting to Peter our cab driver. Mid conversation and music pumping from the tape player, I asked if this was the latest sound in Ghana. He looked at me a little confused and said, "It's Craig David".  Monday 21st January Could have slept for four more hours as morning came quickly. After sharing an omelette with Liba Taylor, our freelance photographer (a seasoned traveller she can sleep anywhere, anytime, anyplace) we head off to another charity, Plan International's, headquarters.I have been sponsoring a child with Plan International and I had called them in London to let them know I was going to visit Ghana. I was keen to see some of their work there too and had arranged to spend a day visiting a community they work in 2- 3 hours from Accra.It was an incredible day that gave me a good introduction to Ghana before my journey up north with VSO. Even in that one day, I felt all of my preconceived ideas about rural Africa were dispelled. We went to a school in Asesewa run by an incredible man Mr Charles Na. After obtaining a masters degree he became an MP, and during this time he was arrested and put into a detention centre. On release he returned home to found the secondary school I was now visiting.The school children were amazing. Not only did the students work extremely hard at home they were also conscientious at school and seemed to generally relish learning. Some of the essays I read put my English to shame, one girl wrote of the "dream light of literature", - unbelievable - a budding Sylvia Plath in the making.That evening back in Accra, we met up with three VSO volunteers working in the capital. Solomon Ezobi, a Nigerian volunteer was working as he put it "with the government". I think it had something to do with accounting and taxes, and looked to be a position of great importance and responsibility. Jane Grier was a management advisor working with the disabled in Accra. She had been campaigning for equal rights for her students and had succeeded in forming a united union of all disability organisations which had strengthened their cause.Finally there was Michelle Banks from Australia. She was training social workers at the University of Ghana.After eating a superb meal in one of Accra's fanciest hotels, the conversation leapt from economy to culture to human rights and I realized how committed, and passionate they were.Tiredness eventually set in and, as we were going to be up early the next day, we said our goodbyes. I promised I wouldn't tell any other VSOs where we'd eaten. Of course one of the first things I said on meeting a new volunteer was "You'll never guess where we went for a meal with the guys in Accra".  Tuesday 22nd January Woke up at 7.15 am to the sound of a gospel tune being sung by the cleaning lady. Breakfast was a subdued affair, as Katrina, Liba and myself were still a little jaded from a hectic day in the field and one too may Star beers. Our VSO driver and guide for the trip Kwesi (pronounced as if Emma Fudd were saying crazy) arrived at 8 o'clock and after a mad flurry of packing bags and loading the Land Rover we were away. Before hitting the road we stopped to change some money. The currency in Ghana is hilarious, the exchange rate in Sterling is 10,000 cedis to the pound and the largest denomination is the 5,000 cedis note! So when I left the bureau de change with a bag full of money it looked like I'd robbed the place. (You need a Del Boy wedge to buy a bottled water in this country!)Travelling up country was visually intoxicating. A barrage of noise and bright colours in Accra merges into tropical villages each having their own speciality produce. Palm oil, coconuts, bananas, oranges, pineapple and finally a village full of coffins! Goats and pigs wander lazily across the road. Vultures fly overhead and all the time women carrying huge pots full of water for miles without spilling a drop.Possibly because there is next to no tourism and Ghana has never been involved in any major conflict you feel you can instantly connect with the people. People are quick to smile. This automatically has the effect of releasing my London blinkers and I drink in all the noise, colours, smells and textures on the journey up.This sensory hypnotism is broken when Kwesi hears some dreadful news. The Ghanaian football team (the Blackstars) drew their first game in the African Nations football tournament with Morocco. Their star player has been given his marching orders for dissent. Kwesi was visibly shaken so I try to convince him that youthful ambition will conquer experience every time and besides South Africa (their next opponent) are past it. I don't think he believes me.During the eight hour drive to our overnight stop in Sunyani I manage to sleep, I'm getting the hang of this international travel lark. In the evening another local volunteer emerges from the bush to join us for a drink.Cherish Ocampo is a charming 28 year old Philippino, teaching wildlife biology at the local college. She arrived in Ghana on the evening of September 11th. She was shy at first but after a while revealed a wonderful sense of humour, great independence and courage. Cherish was the only woman on the teaching staff at the college in and she spoke of initial teething problems and a self confessed weakness in speaking English. I realized quickly that the latter was false modesty.My pathological fear of anything that could eat, bite or sting me, led us on the topic of snakes. Cherish's eyes lit up. It transpired that the school gardeners had found a few cobras in the school grounds and given them to Cherish to start a school collection to use for demonstrations in class."Where do you keep them?" I asked."In a home made glass tank", Cherish replied."Are they difficult to look after? What do you feed them?"Cherish looked up with a cheeky glint in her eye."I haven't fed them anything so far. All but one have died!"There was a slightly surreal pause as I wondered where to go with the conversation. I decided to make a joke of it."What a shame - I suppose you could always stuff them?" I offered with a laugh.There was another polite pause. "Yes. Taxidermy's not until next term though." I looked, she was deadly serious.I think I've fallen in love. Night. Night!  Wednesday 23rd January Woken up by Kwesi on the phone after sleeping in. Had a quick cold shower, grabbed a banana and we were heading north by 8.00 o'clock.The journey to Wa in the upper west region saw a marked change in scenery, from relatively lush vegetation to arid and barren. The poverty levels dropped accordingly. We stopped in Baboi, a tiny village about mid way through journey. It felt like real undiscovered Africa. In a food stall called a Chop Shop we saw the native dish fufu being prepared. A yam (like a non sweet sweet potato) is boiled and then pounded until it reaches a dough like consistency. It's served with stew and eaten with fingers, without chewing. The stew that was being prepared looked like plantain and black coffee. I was a bit of a hit with the village drunk who wanted a map of London. I left him puzzling over the detailed plan I'd knocked up of the one way system round Archway. We then set off on a three hour stretch along a dusty, red and extremely bumpy dirt track that Kwesi christened "the dancing road".After what seemed like an eternity we made it to Wa, where I was to meet my friend Laura. A reception committee was waiting. Laura greeted me with a huge smile and hug and introduced me to her fellow volunteers Ross, Steve, and Suzanne. She looked so well and happy and exuded a warmth and confidence that was fast becoming a trait in all volunteers I'd met.An inter-school football match between Kaleo Wa and Nandom Community School had been arranged for our arrival, so without a second to lose we piled in the Land Rover and drove to the school.Little did I realise that I was booked to play in the match, as the VSO volunteer for Nandom school Mike was already changed in to his strip - Manchester United! Before the match began, it was speech time again. I thanked the teachers and students for the wonderfully warm welcome, pleaded with the Nandom lads to go easy on me and made a cheeky gag about hopefully scoring more goals than the Ghanaian football team. Okay, so it didn't bring the house down!Laura then gave an inspirational speech about fair play. She understood that there was a history between the schools (the last fixture had been a blood bath) but she hoped that our visitors would be treated to a superb exhibition of football. Mike leant over and whispered to me, "We'll see - the coach has just told them to play like your opposite number has just killed your brother".After a little coercion and a bowl of pito (locally brewed beer that tasted like sour scrumpy) I stepped on to the pitch in my Kaleo colours, yellow and green. I ran around like a maniac for five minutes then recieved a bruising tackle for my troubles. With my lungs on fire and realising I should quit smoking I called out to Laura, "Too hot, too bumpy, too old".The Nandom boys were definitely the stronger team. We managed to squeeze a 0-0 draw. I like to think this was due to me shoring up the mid-field, but I think it had more to do with the Kaleo girls singing and dancing provocatively in our goal mouth. Nandom was an all boys school.Shattered, but secretly quite proud of my performance we headed back to Uplands Hotel in Wa. Even more VSO's were waiting for us in the restaurant under the stars. There are 84 volunteers in Ghana, around half working in education. Was I going to meet them all? Talk slipped from food, to education on to illness. Suzanne who arrived a vegetarian, was eating chicken within a week and had quickly graduated to dog. Apparently the best meat is just beneath the skin so you have to put up with a bit of hair if you want the best.There's a refreshing humility and unaffected openness among the volunteers, and they all have a genuine love of the land and its people.Despite the frustrations, principally the lack of materials, all of the teachers are meeting the challenge. Laura, or should I say Miss Laura (as she is known here) has integrated remarkably well. In the year and a half of being here she has taught herself the local tribal language of Dagaare and has an ease of manner and strength that is truly African.  Thursday 24th January For the first time this trip I wake up before Kwesi. I'm assuming it was around 6.00 am. I walked from my room under a mango tree in the muted, misty light of an African dawn. I was alone and the moment was golden. There is something unique about Africa when it wakes up, it is the pensive face of a country that is almost always, boisterous exuberant and gregarious and it is divine.The gang and I went to pick up Laura and Suzanne from Kaleo Wa and we headed into the school to meet the teaching staff and then on to the chief. He is the paramount chief in the region, Naa Bannaamwini Sandu. As we filed into his palace to greet him, I started to feel more than a little nervous. Laura had taught me a respectful greeting in the tribal language and I'd spent most of the morning practising. I had that opening night feeling as I wondered if I would remember it."Ansomah AAY Obesoum".I remembered the first word by that great British lingerie retailer Ann Summers. The second word of agreement is spoken as it looks but imagine you're the Fonz. Ridiculous but it worked and the meeting turned out to be both a moving and funny encounter.Then came the lessons. Just being in a classroom as a student, reverted me back to a sniggering disruptive idiot until I was quickly chastised by Laura.Watching Laura and Suzanne at work with the students was magical. In the stifling heat were two English girls in traditional blue and white Ghanaian dress playing literary bingo and demonstrating solar eclipses with a football and an orange.Walking back with Laura after taking pito with the other masters, I asked her what it was like living and working in Ghana. She said "It's a gift. I feel like I have found a second family and the thought of leaving makes me very sad".Speaking to Mr. John one of the maths teachers at Kaleo Secondary School during lunch, he said of Laura, "We love her! She speaks our native tongue, respects and practises our customs and is a wonderful teacher".Another teacher had entered the lunch gathering and without a seconds hesitation Suzanne had brought him a glass of water. "You see," John enthused, "this is why we love these girls! In our custom, when a stranger enters our house we bring them water".Lunch was prepared by the home economics teacher and it was delicious, spicy beef stew and rice. I watched as Laura squatted on the floor and ate her meal with her fingers, chatting to her colleagues in Dagaare. A moving farewell from the teaching staff followed a last embrace with Laura and we were off. There was just not enough time, I could have stayed for weeks.Next stop was Lassia to spend the night in the bush with Ross and Steve, physics and maths teachers respectively in the local boarding school.On the journey over Kwesi and I attempt to follow the Ghana South African match but the deeper we enter the bush the worse the reception. As we arrive at the boys place we grab the first child we can find and discover the rest was another no score draw.Kwesi is mortified. When he leaves me in the bush, his posture is of a man defeated. I suggest the reason Ghana can't score is because we need to find a TV to watch them on instead of messing around in the remotest regions of Africa. He says "You know you could be right". I say "Of course I'm right. Your country needs you".That evening, I have my first experience of preparing fufu with Abigail and Patricia, two students at Ross and Steve's school. It's exhausting work, while one pounds, the other turns the yam on the upstroke. Abigail gives me a couple of stern looks that I understand as, "My fingers are quite precious to me" so I retire and leave it to the experts.Throughout the meal and the rest of the evening we receive a lot of visitors. Some of the students break the boarders curfew to see the new white man. A couple of lads, that I took an instant shine to were Rodney and Andrew a latter day Butch and Sundance coming to offload their problems with the fairer sex - FANTASTIC!This is no lie, it is 11 o'clock. I'm in a box room with no furniture, lying on a makeshift bed made from bamboo, foam and cowhide. It is baking hot, an evil looking spider is watching me and about a mile away a funeral is in progress. Just so you know, a funeral is a bigger celebration than a marriage, namely more drums and louder singing because the bigger the celebration, the easier the journey to the after life.I joked to friends before I left, "Africa, the damned heat and those incessant drums!" I should know now never to tempt fate.Seriously this place is incredible. I feel so peaceful, inspired and bewitched by this country and its people. It too is going to make me very sad to leave.  Friday 25th January Woken up the old fashioned way by a cockerel. Unfortunately this particular one had absolutely no concept of time, it's four in the morning. I staggered to the toilet in the pitch black guided by a sense of smell. It wasn't difficult to find as it was a long drop lavatory that ripened as the hours wore on. Fortunately I was able to sleep again and was woken up at a more civilised hour by a cacophony of pigs. I ladelled water from the bin in the courtyard for my shower, a bin that cleverly would warm the water through the suns rays. I had a cold shower. Unfortunately - the sun hadn't yet risen.Before Kwesi and the girls picked me up Ross took me on a tour of his school. The thing that stayed with me was the dormitories. In a room about 10 feet long there were six bunk beds and I saw that bedding was thrown down on the remaining floor space. Fourteen children in one tiny sweatbox.The students washed outside in the courtyard and cleaned and ironed their clothes themselves. Despite these facts, everyone looked immaculate in their pink and brown uniforms.I was touched to find Rodney and Andrew waiting to say good-bye when I returned to Ross and Steve's house. Rodney was wearing an old seventies style school tracksuit top with his name stencilled in gold on the back - (Jarvis Cocker eat your heart out). The boys showed me a variation on the West African handshake which involved touching your heart after the click and I felt honoured.We were back on the road for the final stop with Jo and Jenna in Tumu. On the way, something strange happened. Deep in a bush, we saw twenty or so children painted as skeletons standing still looking at us. Some of them held their hands akimbo and started shaking. Kwesi turned to us and said, "There are some things in Africa you will never know about". He told me that Fetishism was widespread and this was an annual celebration of the dead.Sophia and Laura from Jaripa insisted that we stop for lunch and a quick tour of their school, St Francis Catholic school for girls. Out of all the schools we visited, this was the best equipped , but there were four classes without teachers. Unlike in England, where all hell breaks loose, when a teacher doesn't turn up here, the students teach themselves. An incredible sight. Although, the reasons behind this provoke some serious questions.During lunch in a local chop shop, where we sat in the dirt eating rice and stew with our hands I looked around at some of the of the worst images of poverty I've ever seen. We then left Sophia in the midldle of the market to haggle over some vegetables and headed out along another terrible road to Tumu, the poorest town in the region and our final destination.No sooner had we reached the girls Jo and Jenna in Tumu, we were rushing off to an after schools AIDS awareness club.The enthusiasm, humour and confidence of the kids was infectious and my tiredness soon evaporated. Midway through the club, Jo dragged me away to a teacher versus students volleyball match. In the late afternoon light, my favourite hour of the day, a war was waged across that volleyball pitch, a conflict I had never hitherto witnessed on any sporting arena.Tensions grew. After several terrible calls, each one punctuated by a furious peep on his whistle, the umpire made one too many gaffs for Gabriel, the captain of my team. He flipped and a torrent of abuse broke forth, resulting in the umpire, who was also now at breaking point, thrusting the whistle at Gabriel screaming, "Take my whistle! Take my whistle!"Gabriel was apoplectic but soon found his defiant and dignified retort."I don't want your whistle," he said disparagingly."I want justice."Brilliant. I was bent double crying with laughter at this point. I quickly realised however that this was a serious comment. Needless to say we won the match three sets to nil.Supper consisted of chilli chicken. And when I say chicken I mean every single part of the chicken. There had been a power cut, so we resorted to the "touch and try" approach to determine the anatomy of the part we'd chosen. Jenna had a well-practised technique which involved a swift and thorough massage of the meat. I likened the experience to a scene in the Deer Hunter calling it Chicken Roulette.Tiredness was getting the better of me but on the way home by torchlight I insisted we search down a black mamba or at the very least a cobra.The girls humoured me but the hunt lasted all of ten minutes and before I knew it I was face down in my bed, being rocked to sleep by Louis Armstrong's "We have all the time in the world". If only that were the case.The two day journey back to Accra was a calm and relaxed affair in comparison to the previous five days. Throughout the whole journey, the soundtrack playing in the Land Rover was Daddy Lumba, the most successful Ghanaian recording artist around. He played a style of music not dissimilar to reggae but more upbeat, a style called High Life. By the end of our whistle stop tour, I knew pretty much all the words to Daddy's new hit album, Poison! In particular the controversial song, One One One, Six Six Six. It had generated a wave of moral outrage because Lumba had ambiguously transplanted the word sex for six. I of course couldn't wait for each chorus and belted it out with Kwesi everywhere we went.My thoughts, as quickly as they came left my head, and many times I caught myself with tears rolling down my cheeks. The tears were not borne out of pity (or out of Ghana's lack of goals in the Africa Nations Cup) but more of inspiration, and a recognition that I had discovered something in this country's people that I had lost, or maybe mislaid.This is a country and people who need our support but not our pity. There are many qualities in Ghanaians that I believe we could aspire to back home. An extraordinary sense of family seems to underpin every facet of Ghanaian life, something that in our urban centres doesn't seem to highly prized. But my overriding sense of Ghanaians as a race is one of optimism coupled with kindness and gentleness.The other education I received during this trip was regarding charities and specifically VSO. There was a cynicism and distrust within me that money and aid wasn't actually reaching the people who needed it. This was completely dispelled on my trip to Africa. I also had a preconceived idea that VSO was just something people did instead of backpacking around Thailand. How wrong I was proved to be.The VSOs are sent to the most deprived and poverty stricken areas of Ghana, filling teaching placements where degree holding Ghanaians rarely wish to be posted. The principal reason for this lack of enthusiasm is poor pay, terrible accommodation and cultural differences, for example if a teacher from the south of Ghana is coming to live and work in the north.VSO is launching a Valuing Teachers campaign to highlight exactly this problem. It calls for governments to include teachers needs in their plans to improve delivery of education - it's difficult to be a motivated teacher if you're living below the poverty line in a school with no support or management.In spite of the poor pay and often challenging work conditions most of the Ghanaian teachers I met were amazing, both inspirational and pragmatic. The extraordinary Mr Charles Na from Assewa and of course the enthusiastic and brilliant Mr John Vianney Kubara from Kaleo Wa. Both highly educated and courageous men who made the trip back home to support and educate their villages in spite of more lucrative job opportunities elsewhere.I saw people living in the solution rather than the problem, and a sense of optimism pervading the whole community. Yes there were some children who were malnourished, and we saw incredible signs of poverty, but those images of despair we're so used to seeing in the West were replaced by a positivity we don't normally see. The people I met were optimistic and generous, facing harsh living conditions with dignity and most of all humour. I can't wait to go back.

      No, the Queen of Egypt hasn't found love, she hasn't even discovered any clues leading to it's hiding place! She just watched the movie  urlLink "Love Actually" &nbsp;and fallen in love with the concept of falling in love!  It has been a long time since I felt emotionally attached to anyone and watching all of those love&nbsp;stories develop in front of me reminded me of two things:  1. Andrew Lincoln (This Life, Teachers, etc.) is very attractive and worthy of more sites on the internet. 2. It is a wonderful feeling to be in love.  We all hope it will happen to us. Some people give up on it, saying it is a childish dream. That financial security is far more important. Other people live their life waiting for the dream to happen to them. I am the latter. I dream of Mr Right. He must be out there, living his life, oblivious to my whereabouts. One day, our paths will meet. You could call it destiny.   Well, good night to all you dreamers and good night to all the realists. And good night to all those who have found their dream and are happy in their space in the universe.

      So I went shopping today in mighty Tesco (an oversize cornershop that sells everything except...well, best not go there!) and I decided it was time to find out what had been happening in the celebrity world. I picked up a copy of  urlLink Kerrang  music mag so that I could catch up on the rock news and a copy of Now! to find out the ins and outs of being a 21st Century celebrity.   So: Britney is happy with her dancing boyfriend (so?)  Sadie Frost has gotten over her times with Jude Law at last.  Leslie Ash got broken after a bedroom session, contracted an infection and is now starting the recovery period - she can walk again now. (that's some bedroom session)  The fifties are back in again!  Elizabeth Jagger and Sean Lennon are an item.  Jay Kay and Amanda Donohoe are an item.   Anyway, more later.   Love y'all!   I have now found an amusing site which reminded me very much of those years gone by when I had  urlLink technical problems  in my life. Check out this advice page for help.   Or maybe you just want to throw a  urlLink baby  about. WARNING: giggling becomes annoying!   urlLink Bushisms  perhaps?  Extracts from  urlLink letters of complaint ?  Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy

      This is just a short&nbsp;post advising all visitors to my blog to visit this site. It is all about two&nbsp;Red Cross fundraisers from Oxford who sold all they owned to gain money to go from Oxford England to Oxford New Zealand in a Morris&nbsp;Oxford.  urlLink  Oxford2Oxford    While spending a quiet night in the British Embassy, Kimberly and myself met the couple who had just arrived in Cairo. Their next stop was to be India. You can read their diary and maybe donate some money to the cause.

      Well, here I am in England.   I was expecting the weather to be cold and dismal... Well, the dismal part is right. It is cloudy and constantly threatening to be rainy, but it is also humid and hot - even though the temperature is probably only about 24 degrees C! I arrived yesterday after a very bumpy flight that stopped at Athens airport for 4 hours! There I bought a nice bottle of perfume and read my book. I even took a little nap!  So what has happened to me since my arrival? Well, I have visited two pubs and eaten various pork varieties. Most notable was the breakfast this morning of eggs and maple cured bacon. Sorry to offend any not-eating-pork people, but I have missed this food!  I went to bed earlier than I have done in a while and I woke up earlier than I have done in a while. Maybe it's jet lag, I don't know. After breakfast, I turned on the TV and watched various movies that I haven't had the luxury of seeing. They were all linked together by the presence of different actors. It was uncanny. Then I turned on the Sci-Fi Channel (Kimberly would be jealous at this as our TV is not working well yet) and there I watched  urlLink Farscape &nbsp;&nbsp;and was hooked. I just think John Crichton (aka Ben Browder) looks hot in his tight leather trousers! It's a good show, shame it's been cancelled!  Anyway, the prospects for today: go to the pub, enjoy the sticky hot weather of England and watch TV. Tomorrow I shall go and investigate town life! It's funny seeing kids coming home from school (my school ended a month ago!) and it will be even funnier when the weekend starts a day later than I am&nbsp;used to!  Oh well, good bye from mighty blighty!

      In the header at the top of my pages you can read about inflatable babies. Well, apparantly Egypt has sold out of these and the only things available to replace them are black and white inflatable cows, complete with bright pink udders. The guys selling these are carrying 20 or so inflated cows under one arm and a bag of fake noses that make silly sounds when you blow them. Now isn't that exactly what each resident of Cairo is sadly lacking? &nbsp; Saw "The Day After Tomorrow" today... Man that's some scary movie. No monsters. No aliens. Just stupid people who didn't take care of the beutiful planet they inhabited and it bit them back. Now who are those stupid people?????? This is the movie that all governments should watch to gain a complete understanding of just what a mess&nbsp;we have made of the planet! We need to wake up and take some responsibility for our actions! &nbsp; (Steps down from soapbox) &nbsp; Calls from strange guy = 0&nbsp; Hooray! &nbsp; Considered depositing his ring in a shop display but then the good conscience woke up and said that was a mean idea! &nbsp; Going to be taking a holiday to England from tomorrow 3:45am. Tooooooo early! The temperature may be a little warmer there than it has been but it will still be like going to the ice age for me. At least half the daily temperature. &nbsp; I will still contribute to my daily(ish) diary but it will have to be sensible stuff. That is if I survive the first ten minutes with the road system. Here I walk in the middle and cars honk and avoid me - there... I'll be squished. So wish me luck! &nbsp; Pleasant dreams! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      First dates, eh???? Theyâre a funny thing. They kind of set you up so that you know you want to pursue a relationship, or run a mile.  &nbsp;  My last first date was way back when, in the glory days of the 20th Century. It was nice. I was nervous but eager to get to know the attractive guy who asked me out on a date. We ate pasta and I talked incessantly about my life (nothing has changed there!). We parted after dinner with a lingering kiss. It was a good first date.  &nbsp;  Now letâs talk about a dating nightmare. I met this guy at the cartoon voice test. He looked a little like a pirate with a big baggy white shirt tucked neatly into his black jeans. He wore smart, shiny, black shoes and a cap. The only amendment I (or Kimberly) would make would be a black bandana to replace the cap. He appeared to be cute and smiled a lot â at both of us. Upon leaving he said he hoped to speak to us soon. I thought nothing else of it.  &nbsp;  Two days later, at 11am, I receive a call saying he must see me. We arrange a time and place (tricky though, his grasp of English wasnât that good).  &nbsp;  I go to the date venue: a cafÃ© in Zamalek (famous for fabulous cafÃ©s and night spots). I dress casual. I realise when I see a different guy at the cafÃ© that Iâm not THAT into this guy I am supposed to meet. He arrives. Same type of clothing except no hat and his shirt is black.  &nbsp;  We go to the table (surrounded by courting couples) and he sits so close to me that I instantly feel Iâve had enough! Heâs invading my personal space. He shakily grabs my hand and puts a ring on my little finger. OK! I thinkâ¦. He then proceeds to tell me how he fell in love with me the minute he saw me! Wow! I think heâs a headcase!  &nbsp;  Two hours go by of him professing his undying love for me. Discussion of marriage, children and other stuff. I am having trouble saying no to letting him kiss me as it is difficult to keep thinking of different reasons to avoid it. I have run out of conversation and he keeps staring at me. Heâs starting to scare me. I finally end the date saying that I have to go to see a friend who needs cheering up. &nbsp;He says he wants a photograph to remind him of the event. OK. I say thinking a quick photo and then freedom! Oh noâ¦  &nbsp;  By a photograph he didnât mean grabbing his camera and taking a quick snap shot. He took me to Mohandeseen, to a photography shop and there we posed for ten different pictures in a studio. I had to drape my arms over him, lie next to him, all sorts of stupid positions.  &nbsp;  Then, finally I got in a taxi and freedom was mine! I couldnât believe it.  &nbsp;  Let this be a lesson to all guys out there wondering how to impress the girl who just agreed to go out on a date with them: DONâT BE TOO INTENSE ON THE FIRST DATE. Girls will run a thousand miles to escape you, regardless of how attractive you are!  &nbsp;  Anyway, I survived. Texted him to say, âEnough!â. He then called me 8 times. Shame each one was missed!

      So I'm still not well. It is really testing my patience! Thank you Richard for your last comment. I will put together a list of places to see in Cairo and Luxor, and then Egypt as a whole.  Today has been a weird day with a totally unusual thing happening. Yesterday I was called by a friend to see if I would be interested in any voice over work. I thought, yeah, why not. I used to be in a theatre company in the UK called the Barton Green Players in New Malden, London. The theatre world was becoming a distant memory so I jumped at the opportunity to do some more!   I wait with my friend on the steps of a gas company waiting to be collected and taken to the studio (doesn't that sound cool!!!) Eventually we are located. Once at the studio, there is no audition! How strange I hear you yell! We are sitting on rickety chairs in an entranceway to the studio. Other people are being recorded so we wait. We played "I Spy with my little eye..." It was fun! We are then taken into the studio. We are given a text to read...  We are reading the parts of pillow #1 and pillow #2. Yours truly was Pillow #2. I feel I put a lot of character into my part, I really established motives and underlying feelings!!!!!!! OF A PILLOW???!!!  The voice over work is for an animated version of the life of the Prophet Mohamed (PBUH) You have to add the bracketed letters as a sign of respect in Islam. The directors want really British people to do the parts. As I said earlier, it was a very weird situaion.  My friend and I (I think I shall call my friend Kimberly from now on. It's a good pseudonym and she knows it's her) then progressed to Genina Mall in Nasr City where we watched Spiderman 2. It was surprisingly good. I hadn't expected it. Any readers who have seen Spidy2 please comment and let me know what you though of it.  When we came back, I found Penny was feeding her puppies. I want to upload an image but I first have to convince my computer that it's ok to use Hello software. I gave her a rawhide bone. She was happy to see me but was confused by the bone. I daresay she ate it without any problems.  Went to Karaoke at Bullseye tonight. Every Wednesday is Karaoke and I have to be there. If I am not, then the world will explode and people will be forced to live in trees floating through space, boldly searching for new life and new civilisations; boldly going where no man powered trees have gone before! LOL  Anyway, sleepy now. Have a nice night/day wherever you may be and if you visit here, place a pin in the map!  Ishta! (cool!)

      So I have been a little sick these last 2 days. Itâs what we call Pharaohâs Revenge. It is generally the welcome to Egypt you get after the first two maybe three weeks. It soon passes, but sometimes it is necessary to take products like Antinal to relieve the problem. I consider it to be powdered (or liquid) concrete for your tummy. It works like a charm!  I was too sick to go out to go out to the pub or go to hunt for the Mountain Dew Fugitive. I have to tell you about him. Itâs soooooooo exciting! (No hint of sarcasm) The only quality radio station in Cairo is 104.2 Nile Fm. They play quality tracks (but not enough rock for my liking) and they came up with this idea of a fugitive running around Cairo with cash. He telephones in clues in a strange voice throughout the day. You have to listen to these clues to determine where he is, what the password is and what he is wearing. My friend gave the station the idea that anybody searching for him must also be carrying a can of Mountain Dew. So that is the new policy; Go Her!!! Anyway, he starts wandering around with 1000LE  in his pocket (roughly equivalent to Â£100) and each day he is not caught, it goes up by an additional 1000LE. We first became interested when the total was 16000LE (or Â£1600). But now it is the holidays, we have time to hunt for this man. So, far this vacation, we have looked for him twice. We have our handy kit of mini radio, shopping guide, restaurant guide, Cairo guide and map book. Itâs all ready in a bag so that we can just grab the kit and go. Hey it fills the day before going out to socialise with important people, ambassadors and such like!  Oh! I need a massage. Must go and relax in my haven of Maadi. Itâs quite early and to be honest, I have actually just woken up (rather than just going to bed!) Maybe Iâll go for breakfast somewhere. You canât get good quality pork here so bacon is difficult to come by. You generally find beef bacon which is no comparison to Tescoâs Maple Cured Bacon. When I go back to England, Iâm gonna eat bacon every day. Itâs amazing what you miss when you move away! Anyway, have a nice day!

      Well, we decided to go on an adventure this evening and discover a new night spot. Having lived in Maadi (where the grass is indeed fine!) for almost 7 months now, we decided it was high time to enjoy the social life Maadi offered. Every time we come home from Mohandeseen we would go past a place called âThe Golden Bellâ. It intrigued me, so today the alleged âPUBâ was on our to-do list.  Oh, my expectations were low. From the outside it is a small wooden building, with burning neon lights that say âGolden Bellâ and âKaraokeâ. We passed the bouncer and walked through the two doors intoâ¦â¦.an empty bar. A long walk past cubicle seats led us to the main bar. There were maybe 7 or 8 people in the entire pub. Two were playing pool, two at the bar and some other people round the corner.   We looked around and discovered there were two rooms hidden behind darkened glass. One door opened, to reveal a gathering of Koreanâs singing out loud and playing tambourines. We sat at the bar and listened to Melody TV combined with Korean songs. Looking around further we noticed a darts board. Now, we both play darts and so upon seeing a darts board we thought about playing a game or two. We then looked at the surroundings: poor lighting, no score board, no line on the floor to indicate where one should stand. But all of these are nothing compared to the fact there is a table and chairs set underneath the board. âPlease sit hereâ¦â whack!!!! Dart in the head!!!!!! Wow, it is exactly as you would expect from a country where health and safety is an unknown thing.  Ahhh, health and safety, now thereâs an interesting thing. A few examples are needed so that people outside of Egypt understand the joke. Letâs start withâ¦ scaffolding.  In England, scaffolding is carefully put up with slabs of concrete to secure the lower struts. The horizontal bars are bolted together and all bars are made from strong metal. Now think the opposite and youâre in Egypt.   Electrical sockets without earth wires. They actually spark when you go near them with a plug. A mini firework display is the best description.  Elevators: Ahhhhh. In England they have doors. In Egypt we watch with interest as the wall of the lift shaft zooms past.   Enough. I must go to bed. Iâm watching Wives and Daughters, the BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskellâs book. I confess I am a big fan of period drama. I need to get hold of Pride and Prejudice. I need to have a Mr Darcy fix.  Good Night World! ! !

      So when an ambassador for a country wants you to marry him, he really goes all out there! "I'll build you a school...you can teach and I'll run it for you!" This is a little extreme I feel. I say I'll think about it. Hey, Mauritius is a hot sunny country where there are white beaches and apparantly hotels with bedrooms that have glass floors so you can see the fishes under you. Sounds cool, but I don't want to marry a man older than my own father in order to obtain it! Egypt is one very interesting place where invitations to get married happen frequently.   Today I turned down an invitation to go on a felucca at night. Consider me crazy, but I didn't relish the opportunity to go on a boat at night with nine slightly worse for wear people!! I was very sober and very sensible!  Nothing really crazy happened today. But there was a very memorable meal. I had roast lamb with roast potatoes, beans and carrots, a huge quantity of gravy and... wait for it...MINT SAUCE!! It is the first roast I have had since Christmas. It was delicious! It was so delicious I forgot to leave room for my desired pudding...Apple and Cinnamon Crumble. That would have been perfect. It just means I'll have to go back to that restaurant again!! For readers living in Cairo and desirous of a good roast meal, it is The Nook in Maadi Degla. Street 254. Check it out!!!!!!  Time for sleep now. Must get up later for breakfast - I promised a friend. Good night and sweet dreams!

      Men with guns just walked past my house!! Not the usual rifles, but hand guns - tucked into their trousers. Life is bizarre.   Just got in after singing away in a karaoke. Sing sing sing I went. It was very nice! I had a great time. I am very sleepy now.  Today: Man selling inflatable puppies - who buys this stuff??????? Particularly while they're driving down the road!  Also: Saw two small boys pushing a drinks cart piled high with stuff down the motorway. I wonder where they were going to?  Thanks for your comments. I did leave Al Rehab to have a more interesting social life and to be closer to Ancient Egyptian stuff. I can see the pyramids when I am on my way home from work you know!  Made friends with a man who teaches soldiers how to fight properly in tanks. He's Egyptian and so he is also trying to teach me some Arabic. He said my Arabic was very good, I don't necessarily believe him!  Anyway, goodnight to one and all!  Rosie

      So I moved to Egypt 11 months ago to work in a small town of no consequence. The only impressive thing about the small town is its name: Al Rehab. Yes, I moved to Egypt to live in Rehab!!! The town had no life and no prospect of life. It was good for people who had families but not me (I had just left the nightlife of London!)  I stayed in Rehab for a while, rarely venturing out. But then I moved to a slightly larger town called Maadi. It's closer to places of alcohol and loud music! I am happier now!  The point of setting up this blog is to educate the world about the crazy things that happen here. I've already got to the point where I take many things for granted when I could be sharing these experiences with others!  Today: I went on a falucca (which is a small sail boat) just around the Nile for an hour. It was very relaxing, or it would be but for the Italian film crew filming us. We still don't know why they were filming us but hey, maybe I'll be famous! LOL!

      That is the sound of time ticking away. I only have 14 days left in England before I have to go back to Egypt. Don't get me wrong, I am looking forward to returning to the sun, the heat and the karaoke, but I will miss my folks. Also going back means that work is about to start again.  I teach Egyptian dolls and army boys how to read, write and count using the British curriculum. That means they know about Queen Victoria and Henry 8th but know very little about Egypt! I do look forward to getting my new class. The only question is: will they be the children I was told I would be getting at the end of last term? We will see.  The Children go back to school on 31st August, but teachers return on 24th August so that we can prepare our classes. There will be many new teachers joining this year so that is kinda exciting. Hopefully they will be a fun-loving bunch and not members of the older (I mean OLDER) generation.  Anyway, these next two weeks are mine. Even if it rains like it did today (not used to rain - it only rained three times in the last year in Egypt!) or if it is sunny, I will be partying in London and Brighton.  Enjoy your life!
