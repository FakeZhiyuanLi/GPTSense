						   sorry, that was a very dated reference to the other swedish pop sensation, what was the name of that group again??&nbsp; but really, my life is really great right now.&nbsp; i like my job, i have a wonderfully behaved baby (although i don't know what she could do to misbehave at this point) and the money situation is looking up thanks to my hard-working husband. &nbsp; my job has not always been so great, but now that elisa is gone for the week, it is looking up.&nbsp; has anyone else ever worked with someone who sucks every ray of sunshine and hope from your&nbsp; very being??&nbsp; ok, then you know what i am talking about.&nbsp; she just complains about everything all the time.&nbsp; it starts the moment she walks in the door, and by 5:00, everyone is so miserable it's pathetic.&nbsp; really though, since she has been gone i noticed we all get along better, we spend less time gossiping, and the boss isn't even as stupid.&nbsp; hmmm . . . i wonder if anyone else is noticing the same thing. &nbsp; now that work is going so well, i think i will get a new job.&nbsp; i have an interview in a couple of weeks with a company that would nearly double my income.&nbsp; the only drawbacks are longer hours and no maternity insurance for two years.&nbsp; these may not seem like a lot, but i feel like i have already missed to much time with my baby.&nbsp; i'm the only person i know that han't seen her smile.&nbsp; also, i want to have a child in the next eighteen months, and given the pregnancy complications (blood clots) i had with my first child, i know the second will be even more expensive.&nbsp; i just don't know what to do really. money . . . kid(s)???&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; lately i have been nagged by the poem "richard cory" by edwin arlington robinson.&nbsp; anyone who has stayed awake through sophomore english knows which one i am talking about the one about the rich man whom everyne envied, but he was so lonely he shot himself.&nbsp; depressing i know.&nbsp; i don't know why it has been in my head , maybe so i am careful not to envy people for their material posessions.&nbsp; i can't think of anyone right off hand i envy though.&nbsp; it's just weird really, and it is starting to get me down.&nbsp; oh well, enough for now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
