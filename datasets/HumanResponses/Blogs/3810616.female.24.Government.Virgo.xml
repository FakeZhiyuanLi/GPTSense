       2 months.   14lbs and 23 1/2 inches long.  Two month vaccines were absolutely heartbreaking. Have you ever seen a human being feel pain for the first time? Well, that's what it's like. Four vaccines, two in each thigh and you can hear the pain in his cry. It's like nothing you could ever imagine, to watch your child&nbsp;feel pain for the first time and you can't do anything about it.&nbsp; I know there's more to come...tripping while on a run, scrapped knees, falling off bikes, etc. I doubt I'll ever get use to it.  &nbsp;

      Our most significant event of the day would have to be THE BATH. He doesn't know weather to love or hate it...I would say he is still deciding.   urlLink

      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
