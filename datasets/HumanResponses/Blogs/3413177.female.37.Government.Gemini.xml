      We (me and the kids) went to Jeremiahs Ice Cream Social last night - it was absolutely packed. People were eating in the gym, in the hallways and outside. It was really nice to see everyone before school gets out.

      Well - I had my job interview last night - it went pretty well.  The pay sounds about right - and the hours would be really good - only 30 a week - I may be able to do without the babysitter for Jacob. I should hear something next week.  We received an email last night from "C" - with a photo of "J" attached - he looks so much like Joshua, it is amazing.  Tonight we have an ice-cream social at Jeremiah's school - should be fun, although I am so tired I would love to just go home and sleep - But I don't think i'm going to get more than 5 hours sleep for the next 17 years!

      I went to see SHREK 2 over the weekend with the Boys - we all loved it - better than No. 1.  It is soooo funny.  I am so  TIRED  of rain... when will it end?  I heard over the weekend that a school mate of my brothers, killed himself because he might have had to pay more child support and he would have only had $50 left at the end of the month... Welcome to the real world. I'm sorry he died, but he didn't even go to court yet! - so sad.  Speaking of court - we should find out today what type of custody we get of the other 'boy'.  I have a job interview on wednesday for a bookkeeper for a construction company in Waukesha - keeping my fingers crossed for lots of money.

      Well - here we are, at the half way point of the week. And such a long week it is - I am so looking forward to a 3 day weekend, although George has to work on Saturday and Monday. Let's see - whats been happening that is interesting and worth mentioning... The kids are just sitting and playing PS2 all day, which has to stop next week - I am going to be giving them a list of things to do each week and it won't include PS2.  Found out that we have flying ants in the basement - who knows how they ever got there - but I have to go to the store tonight and buy some ant bombs.FunFunFun I'm taking a web design class at Stritch and the final project is to create my own web page - so look out for that!

      Well - I've made it thru another week of work. I really like the job and I would love to get hired as a permanant, but the management really sucks.  Luckily for all of us, it is an elected position and they are not running for office again at the end of the year.  Nothing really much happening on the home front. George has a possible job offer coming today - lets keep our fingers crossed. I'm tired of being broke!  On Saturday, we are taking the kids to a Judo workshop for the blind. Their teacher has asked that they help the kids out and so we thought that it would be a good experience for them.  Summerfest started yesterday, which really doesn't affect me at all, since I never go - have never been and really don't care to go. But the traffic at Georkes corner is unbelievable on a night- it is a loading zone for wisconsin coach lines and so the lot is packed.

      We may actually have a day without rain today. I don't know if I can handle the change!! Jeremiah received his report card over the weekend - he is very ready for 1st grade (according to his teacher) he got top marks in all categories - so his reward for a good report...RED HAIR, yup - we dyed his hair red over the weekend - I did tell him that we would have to shave it before he goes back to school in the fall though! Yesterday I had a class at school on creating web pages... it is so easy, the only thing is coming up with ideas on what to put on it. I thought of just begging for money - but that didn't fly too well with the instructor - I wonder why? My grandma arrived from England today - she is here for 3 months - well actually here and in Canada, at my aunts house.

      Why are some managers so AHHHH!.  If I'm taking a 15 minute break, I don't want to spend it talking to you about business. Now I have to go outside for lunch just so she won't talk to me!  Jeremiah brought over ones of his little friends yesterday asking for a bandaid (we are the bandaid house!) - I told Miguel he had to go home and get it washed - it was right by his eye and it didn't look good - he came back at 8:30pm(which I didn't like) and he had 3 stitches in it.  They are such a strange family!  No real plans for the weekend - paying bills, judo practice for the boys and laundry.

      I have to tell you a funny story.  I received an email yesterday from a current GE employee asking me for help with a part of my old job.  After laughing and swearing I said NONONONONON! - can you believe the nerve of the man... I haven't heard back from him either. I guess he didn't like my answer.  We took the kids to the park last night so they could play in the water - it was nice, just 2 families there.  Jacob wasn't too thrilled with the sand on his feet but he did like the water.  My baby has discovered that he can climb out of crib now. I'm not ready for my last baby to be in a big boy bed though - so maybe he'll forget how to climb out.  Hoping for a quiet day today - I have to fill out a job application for the temp job that I'm doing now - I am going to apply for it as a permanent - at the recommendation of the employees that I am supervising!

      The bus was packed today going into Milwaukee - we had to leave 5 people behind for the next bus.  The kids did good yesterday by themselves - I hope it stays that way for the rest of the summer.  They went to the park for a lunch program that the Library is putting on every Monday. They seemed to enjoy it. Tonight I have to finish the laundry and get the math problems ready for tomorrows chores. (better then summer school!)

      How come when a mom goes away for a few days - nothing gets done around the house - every dish that was used is piling up in the sink  - every newspaper that was read is on the table and every item of clothing is on the bathroom floor!!! AND THEN, when you walk in - you're asked - whats for supper - Hello!! i've just been driving for 3 1/2 hours - get your own supper.!!!

      I am so tired of the rain.  How can you go from having the a/c on to heat...  Its my birthday tomorrow - I think I gave enough hints to the family that I would like SOMETHING/ANYTHING. Its also the last day of school for the kids. AHH - let the summer begin!

      Quite an uneventful night last night.  The kids played outside, I did laundry and daddy watched TV and cooked supper. What a life we all have!  Today I made it into the office before the heavens opened up - I'm so glad too - I hate getting wet before I come to work - going home its fine -   Nothing much happening today - just sending out a few resumes to people that I hope will hire me!

      Well - I'm working on about 1 1/2 hours sleep - the little one has a bad cough and cold and he thought that he would be better if he didn't sleep last night - I tend to disagree - but who am I - just the Mom.  Uneventful weekend all in all. Kids did Judo - I cleaned the house

      Well - another day in the life of Julie and the Boys. Lets see, what interesting stuff can I write about today. Son #3 and Son #1 had Judo last night. Son #2 had baseball and Son #4 hung around with mom.  I've been looking for the perfect job today - 20 hours a week at full time pay, I really don't care about the benefits either, but the job doesn't seem to exist.  I have an MBA and can't find a job... lovely

      It's a quiet day in the office today - 2 people are on vacation and 2 out sick and then the manager left a lunch because she was in pain. We may actually have a day without rain today... keeping fingers crossed.

      I am so tired of the rain - will it ever end.  Had a nice holiday weekend, we met Joey for the first time in 10 years - it went pretty well - not awkward like we thought it might be. George is going to his baseball game tonight.  Had a cookout for the parents yesterday - nothing like grilling in the rain!  Back to the rut of riding the bus again today - although there must be still quite a few people off work because the bus wasn't all that full this morning.

      'the' job interview. Yes - I finally had the job interview yesterday for the temp job that I am doing.&nbsp; It went okay - kind of hard to ask questions about the job when you are currently doing it.&nbsp; I did ask her when she hopes to make a decision and she said next week - so we will see.&nbsp;  I came home from work yesterday and Jeremiah had received quite the radical buzz cut from his dad... but he seems to like it even though he hair isn't red anymore (his reward for doing good in school!).&nbsp; Jacob is still a wild one, not saying too much but 'talking' all the time. He understands so much though. I'm sure he'll be the next one to get a buzz from dadddy. Next week i'm in a class for school all week so no work for me and no daily trips on the bus to work. Although I don't get paid for it - so it kind of sucks - but at least the class is close - about a mile from my house.

      Well - I haven't posted in 10 days but nothing much has happened except for the last 48 hours. Lets start with Saturday morning - jeremiah came home from a week and church camp- he loved it and has already made plans to go back next year (i'm sure it helped that he stayed in grandman and grandads cabin!) Sunday - Went to church as normal, well as normal can be when your minister has to take a 6 month medical leave because he is having 'issues' with something that happened in his childhood!! - please!! In the afternoon I get a call from my dad that my mom is in the hospital with gallstones. She has one stuck in a duct and so they are doing that surgery today and then removing the gallbladder tomorrow (tuesday) - so I was worrying about her and running around trying to find a babysitter for jacob - thank  you mother in law for filling in. I think thats about it for now - but its still early in the day yet!!

      I am so looking forward to the long weekend - although it seems to be very busy, if I follow thru on all my plans. Tomorrow is cleaning day and laundry day - which with 2 kids, will take all day instead of a few hours. Sunday we are going to my brothers house to play in his pool - I hope the weather will cooperate. And then on Monday, Jeremiah goes off to camp for a week. My baby going to camp!! it won't be too bad though because my parents are going also and he will be staying in their cabin. George has to work on Saturday and Monday - so we won't see much of him this weekend.  I found out today that I am on the list of possible hires for the temp job that I am currently doing - I am 3rd on the list, which makes me feel somewhat good. Now that I'm this close - i really want the job now - i even have an idea of where we can move to - Oak Creek area - I know a day care there for Jacob and i'm sure the schools are okay. I think i'd like to be close to a bus line also - after riding the bus for 4 months every day - i'm kind of used to it and used to a tank of gas lasting me 2 weeks - we will see though - I have to get the job first!!!  Have a save and happy week everyone out there ( I think only 2 of you read this though... SM and MB!)

      Well - I was off work all last week - not vacation but it was relaxing.  I was at a class for school, learning about all the technology tools that are available for kids to use in the school classrooms. It was very interesting. What I liked about it was that I could sleep in until 7:30am every morning - so getting up at 5:30 today was really hard. My computer crashed last week - not very thrilled about that because before it felt the need to crash it also felt the need to mess with the CD with all my files on it. So I really lost everything. I was totally ticked but I soon got over it. Now the computer is OFF limits to everyone but ME.  Joshua is back from vacation with his mom and step dad. Jeremiah is on vacation with his uncle, aunt and cousins and Jacob is home with grandma.  Joshua really wants to babysit him, so tomorrow we are testing it out (grandma will be next door, so thats not too bad), we are having another diaper changing lesson tonight. My bosses husband died last week - hand a brain anurism and died just like that at 53 years of age, very shocking.  My pastor is now gone for a year on personal/medical leave. We are getting a temporary pastor for a year while he sorts out his problems, I hope he does it quick for his families sake, wife and 5 kids! Tonight I'm going to post something on eBay for the first time, to see what its like and how long it takes to sell something.
