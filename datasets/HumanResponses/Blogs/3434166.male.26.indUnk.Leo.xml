      Sold the T.V. on Friday, used money to pay off credit cards.  It's amazing no T.V. I have all the time in the world.  Mowed the yard, waxed the truck, and washed the bike,  all by 2 p.m.  Took the bike out for a drive, got it up to 159mph, no cops in sight.  I cruised around for about two hours, passed about 50 cars, and decided it was time for some fun.  I went to the chocolate shop to meet some friends for shits and giggles.  Somehow I managed to picked up a girl named Ashley(sweet girl, blonde and got it goin on).  I went up to the bar to get a four horsemen and she asks me "Is that your bike out in the parking lot?"      " Yeah " I answered.     "Wanna take me for a ride?" she asked with a sweet smile.     "Sure"  I enthusiastically answered.      " Let me go tell my friends" she giggled.      I told the Lindy, the bar tender to cancel that drink, she had heard the whole thing and had already started another drink.        "Dick, come here, "  Lindy leaned over and said quietly, "That girl has been asking about you since last weekend.       Cool I thought she just wanted a ride on the bike.  I waived at my friends and pointed at Ashley, they all just raised their beer glasses. We cruised around and hit a couple of bars until about 2 a.m., had the time of my life. We dedided to finish out the night with the nightly Whiskey For My Men, Beer For My Horses toast at the cactus.  We talked and decided to hit Steak and Shake.  I dropped her off at her apartment about 4, leaving her with about a ten minute kiss.  (Remember Life Begins at 2a.m.)     We are going on a real date Monday, thought about taking her to Outback, but who knows.  It's about 2p.m., gotta get ready for some hangover golf or maybe not just heard thunder.

      Same old stuff got up around 10 cleaned the house and put the T.V. in the classifieds. I rode the bike to the gym at noon, went to work about two. (I swear to god that 2-10 is the stupidest shift ever thought of/but 5% premium) Then the fun begins you see about 8 months ago our company hires a new fatass to walk aroung and tell us what we're doing wrong and make us do it wright. Let's call this fellow maggot.  This maggot has decided that I only need about 30 people to supply and entire factory with enough parts to build 120 semi trailers a day lets keep in mind that to cut costs we make absolutely everything out of the cheapest,worst quality, bottom of the barrel material available,the same goes for all machinery, people, and work conditions.  Needless to say we are working 10 hour days to do six hours of work. Maggot's ass is in a sling because manhours are through the roof and management is starting to discover just how stupid he is, his solution "work harder", I look at my merry band of men half of can't understand a fucking word because they just crossed the border the other half just thinking " Fuck you you fat fuck", and think that maybe tomorrow there will be about 5 less of them.  All night I'm getting pages we're out of this we're out of that and just when it couldn't get any worse I get a call on the radio need help on the amada quick #$@%@$%@%.  Some poor bastard cut 3 of his fingers off, when I say cut I mean smashed--think hamburger,  after sending him to the hospital we have to look for the fingers.  We found them put'm in a plastic bag and sent them to the hospital.  Well that wrapped up the knight for me.  I'm just happy at this point not to get a ticket on the way home.

      The irony of life that we work at jobs we hate to buy shit we do not need--Tyler Durden.  I swear to god never buy anything unless it brings you joy or pleasure.          1.My bike pleasure, love, entertainment, women all in one $140 a month payment.     2.My T.V. laziness, love handles, lack of motivation$800.    3.My bed once   again pleasure, love, entertainment, and pussy$1200.     4.My computer See My T.V $1500.    5.My Gym membership entertainment, love, and good health$55 a month.     6.My house work, more work, shelters all the rest $125,000.   7.My truck allows me to drive to work to pay for all the above, insurance, GAS GAS, repairs, and let's not forget the truck itself  I guess it allows for drunken four wheeling $25,000.   8.My Stereo, well I guess that helps with 3.          My new goal is to eliminate these things that do not bring pleasure or joy.  That means the T.V., the computer, and the truck.
