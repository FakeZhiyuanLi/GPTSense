        Tonight I watched the Jets roll all over the Colts in their 2nd preseason game.  Chad Pennington played great, completing 10 of 11 passes and throwing for 150+ yards and a touchdown.  I really hope they get him signed to a contract extension soon.  Besides that, the first team didn't look that great.  The run defense sucked, and looked mostly the same as the last 3 years.  We were playing what might be the best offense in the NFL though, so it's not time to panic.  The Jets shutdown Manning with the exception of one big play to Reggie Wayne.  On the Colts opening drive Abraham hit Manning from the blind side, slowing down his pass and allowing Donnie Abraham to pick it off in the endzone.  Decent performance, and it's good that we are halfway through the preseason without any major injuries.  I can't wait to see this offense once Moss and Chrebet get on the field.  BTW, the following still suck: -The Jets backup QB's - Team USA Basketball -The Dolphins

        Since my last post, Team USA has actually won a couple of games. First, they beat Greece. I watched it, and once again they couldn't shoot for shit. When did Richard Jefferson get this bad? Luckily Lamar Odom bailed them out with a bunch of big plays on defense.  Then, today they beat Australia. I didn't see the game, but from what I heard, we actually played really well in the 2nd half. Looking at the boxscore, Iverson, Duncan, and Marion played really well. Seems like Wade played good too, and Richard Jefferson only took 3 shots. It would be nice if we actually played a complete game, but hopefully the winning continues.  The Yankees Pitching has been scary, and not in a good way. I don't think there is one pitcher on their roster who you can be confident in to pitch good in the playoffs. At this point, El Duque might be our best pitcher. Mussina is back, but he struggled in his first start back, and hadn't exactly been tearing it up before he went on the DL. Kevin Brown has been pretty good, but not great, and not consistent at all. Same with Vazquez. Lieber put together a couple of good starts in a row, but I'm not counting on that continuing. Loaiza has been consistent. Consistently giving up 4-5 runs a game while pitching only 5 or 6 innings. That isn't going to cut it. If all our pitchers get hot at the same time, we could still go all the way. Otherwise, it might be an early exit for the 2nd time in 3 years.  That's all I really have to say now. I did add a counter on the bottom of the page to see how many people actually read this shit. I'll probably write again after the Jets preseason game this Saturday vs. the Colts.

         The Jets had their preseason opener on Friday. Here are my thoughts:     Chad Pennington looked very good, as usual    Curtis Martin is a lot more healthy than in years past, he will have a very good year    Vilma is a beast. He better be in the starting lineup by the time the season starts    The first string defense looked good as a whole. Of course, they were facing a backup QB, and Duece McCallister only had about 2 carries. Next Saturday's game against the Colts will be a much bigger test.    If Pennington gets hurt, I will kill myself. Brooks Bollinger is awful. Ricky Ray looks even worse so far. Hopefully one of them will step it up soon     The Yankees continue to roll along. I'm happy that we are playing so well and probably have our best team since 98, but it would be nice to be in a close playoff race for once. With a 10.5 game lead over Boston, and a 10 game lead over Oakland for homefield advantage in the playoffs, there doesn't appear to be much to get excited about until October. At least there are some other good races though. The AL Central, AL West, and both wildcards should go right down to the wire.    Team USA Basketball is a joke. Whether we lose the rest of our games, or win the gold, I really don't care. This team is boring to watch. If we win in a blowout, it's because we are supposed too, and are on a different level than the rest of the countries. If we win in a close game, it isn't exciting, it usually means we played like shit and were lucky to pull it out. And then when we lose in a blowout like today, it's just a total disgrace. I'm tired of just trying to put an all star team together. Find guys who fit what the team is trying to do. Or better yet, forget the NBA, and right after college season ends assemble a team full of college players. It will leave more time to practice, and will give us team basketball, instead of 12 superstars running around heaving up shots and turning the ball over. Maybe then, by the next olympics I'll watch more basketball than badminton.

        Here is my blog where I will post all my thoughts about all the stuff I like, and maybe some other shit too. I'll probably post any exciting things that happen in my life that are worth mentioning, but I wouldn't expect many posts about that. I don't know how often I'll update. Sometimes I might update more than once a day, sometimes I might go a couple of weeks. It all depends what I feel like doing.  Enjoy.
