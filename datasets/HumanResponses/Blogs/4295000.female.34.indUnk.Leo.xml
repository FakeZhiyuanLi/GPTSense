       HI   i went to take stephanie to school on July 28th 2002 and driving normal as usual.The girls in their seatbelts and I see a car (truck) spiral out of control from a turn and coming right at me.He hit us head on.I recall crying hysterical cause of my children and my van being crushed.My knee went right into the dashboard and my neck/shoulders was KILLING me because during impact I had to turn around and look at my children.I believe this is what started my pain.I was very concerned for Ashley at the momment for crying hysterical how she banged her head and her back.The ambulance put her in a stretcher and put her in the ambulance.Stephanies knee was totally swollen.I felt a sharp pain in my back , it felt like I couldn't breathe...plus I could NOT move my head to the left side at all.:( My 2 yr old baby was the ONLY one who came out without ANY pain that i know of..just a few little bruises.She was scared of cars for a few days afterwards as well but today is doing well.From time to time she'l say mamma car went "BOOM"..and slam her hands together.SO precious.      We got to the hospitol and got xtrays done.I got some pain medication,muscle relaxers and told i had some nice spasms on my neck.My shoulder was very puffy and I was surprised that the dr didn't seem very concerned but again concentrated on my children.I mentioned my knee was hurting but please take care of Stephanies knee who at the time was VERY swollen,I had a fear it was broken=*(    Ashley came out and we all went home.The first night at home was HORRIBLE.I could not sleep due to the neck.I could NOT sleep unless I slept with my head straight facing up.I used pillows and no matter what I could NOT get comfortable.My neck was a BIG issue for days..the lack of being able to move it.I seen my regular MD 2 days later and told her about my neck and she as well saw the bump above my shoulder and was concerned about my knee.My knee which i NEVER EVER had a problem with in my entire life is not acting up BADLY=*( It started with a nice bang on the van...(wondering if Air bag deployed if that would've helped that)...and now I feel a "PIN" n NEEDLE pain...and It also gives "out".During the night I have to sit up in PAIN to straighten it out.It takes a GOOD 5 minutes,and this is just to go to the bathroom.By the time I come back....between my knee and my lower back and neck issues it is truley affecting my sleeping habits.Coming mornings I am still very tired.      Ashley complained about her back for approx 2 weeks...woke us up crying a few times.I almost took her out of cheerleading and didn't get the dr's signature for cheerleading till I felt that she is 'safer' to go cheerleading.It is her life and It breaks my heart to see ANY tears from my daughter regarding this issue.Another issue is her scab fell off from the accident..(it was a scrape or bumpy scrape from the door she hit her head with...and it became scabby and fell off and in result it left a scar a nice sized one on her beautiful forehead).To say the least that was extremely upsetting.      My 3rd daughter Stephanie suffered from Knee pain,right now she is in FLORIDA with her father,when she comes back I will PRAY that she is feeling better.If not I will pursue her getting PROPER treatment for her knee as well...if it feels ANything like mine..I can only fear her pain.         I started the Chiropractor this week..monday being my first day.August 16th was my first chiropractor appointment with Dr Summer(sp)..In Garfield Avenue In toms river.This is because...A)EVERY night at 1,3 and than staying up till 5 or so watching movies cause My neck and back hurt and I could NOT for the life of me get comfortable again to get to sleep.I actually had tears in my eyes because I wanted to sleep so badly.When Sleep came I felt stabbing pains in my lower back.My neck still gets pins and needles and I do not know what is happening to me and I am scared cause this is my body.I took GREAT care of my Body all my life,to stay fit and in shape.I loved to dance and do aerobics,now my knee gives out and I cannot do squats like I used to.I hate going food shopping cause my knee starts to hurt half way around the supermarket.This is all recent episodes....all within this week.TOday,which is AUGUST 20th I went to the chiropractor.He put his stuff on my back..I feel NO better yet..slightly better I think than the same pains come back to me.I am praying to the LORD to please Heal me fast so I can live my active life like I used to in the past.At cheerleading,approx 5pm(for ashley),My knee started to THROB worse than it has ever throughout this whole ordeal.It is proving In MY opinion that it is getting Worse.I was for a day or so hoping it was getting better but no its still painful.Driving nowadays is painfull.I have to straigthen my knee andmassage it..I have ice compresses I put on it,plus on my back..and find myself straightening and trying to stretch VERY often to help the pain.The medications I am on IS NOT HELPING ME...and all the while I do not want a heavy narcotic either.I feel helpless in this situation      I made an appointment with Dr johnson the orthopedist,per request of my DR CAROL POSCHE who is a nurse practitioner.My knee is not the same.One bone sticks out and the other one is flat all of a sudden.I do not understand what happened to it..and i wish I could.I am seeking answers to these questions..I will continue to add anything else that comes to mind and what i go through as time goes by.RIght now I have to stop cause my neck is HURTING and my knee is HURTING..As usual,I cannot sit in an upright position.I cannot wait to try the pillow the Chiropractors office had given me to try.:)    AS far as the van issue..that is an ENTIRELY another story.I feel I got put through the MAJOR run around.First the appraiser wants to put a motor from another kia that got hit through the back into my kia...(its a sedona ex model...beautiful van with leather interiors , dvd player,moon roof the works..i saved for so sooo long to buy this van,my dream come true for me and the children).I was actually contemplating it,but than wondered about the warranty.Kia has a 100,000 mile warranty.How do I rely on this new motor??My car went from place to place with people not even speaking directly to ME in person.I am almost deaf and found myself Lost without my van...or ANY transportation for a week or so and it was HELL trying to get myself and children to the dr's.THANK GOD for Camille,who works for high point for giving me a rent a car...I do not know how my treatments would be done without that car.Anyways,Mr Appraisal and Myself start to joke around,how would Kia find out if this is a different motor..and As I am joking,I am wondering to myself,is this the NORM?Is this what people DO when you get into an accident and need  your vehicle fixed and appraised.Heaven knows I paid enough for Car insurance.Why am i getting the run around now?When I last spoke to the Man from Lacey Collision,he told me that "I" would have to pay OUT OF POCKET for a motor...a brand new one so that 'kia" would ok it...and warranty it again.They wanted to take my KIA to a SHELL gas station...all this had me worried,I still owe 23 thousand dollars on this vechicle and I just didn't trust the whole situation at ALL!   With the help of my mother and my cousin PEPE RODRIQUEZ who is an employee at Pulaski collision center(not sure of the name)...My van got transported there.LACEY COLLISION Charged 1100 dollars Or more..not sure to allow the RELEASE of my van!PLUS my van got released WITHOUT a HOOD!Where is my HOOD????   When my van gets to Pulaski in newark NJ..my mother is told that they feel that my van was damaged BY HAND!now this is getting to be a bit out of control.WHAT!Now I am feeling totally helpless..I do not have my van,My children CRY for the van cause they can recline on it and relax.ESpecially Ashley who used to watch her movies on it daily...and recline her seat when she needed a nap.This is all I have on the top of my head right now.I PRAY that tonight I can sleep without ANY interuptions.I should ask the dr about Ambien or something.I definately need to get rid of this horrible pull out couch we have because I feel it is not helping the situation at all.I will be looking into the temper Pedic mattress so it can help my back and neck improve over time.My knee is totally NOT THE SAME AND I feel pain right now as I am typing,my knee is throbbing,It feels like a pin an ICY pin is inside of it picking at it.This is the best I can describe it.Right now it is August 20th at 11pm. I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
