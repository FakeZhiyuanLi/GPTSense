      Congratulations to Chad Henneman.  Chad has commented on my blogs more than 10 times and as a result he will be receiving a gift certificate for a free buffet at Ponderosa in Dubuque.  I put together a few more articles for my portfolio today.  Through  urlLink Journalism Jobs  I found a job at Penn State that I would like to have.  I would rather be working for the Badgers, but a job at a Big Ten school is a job at a Big Ten school.  Alas, I will probably end up selling phones with Tino in Onalaska or pruning the cacti in Arizona with Mike.

      Kathleen commented that the  Waukesha Freeman  isn't all it's cracked up to be, so perhaps it's a good thing I was blown off.  I showed the aforementioned e-mail of rejection to Dr. Hadorn and he thought it was very unprofessional.  If I had $60,000 I would  urlLink purchase K.I.T.T.   I was a big Knight Rider fan growing up.  I had a K.I.T.T. "Big Wheel" and would cruise down my driveway and nearly into the street.  I watched John Edwards' speech at the Democratic National Convention last night on PBS.  Yes, I watched PBS, because that's channel that comes in clearest with my antenna.  And yes, I use an antenna, because it would be self-defeating to pay $42.00 a month for cable when I live in the low-income apartments.  Whether or not Kerry and Edwards are elected and they are able to accomplish what Edwards was promising last night remains to be seen, but as far as speeches go, I thought he did a good job.  I am interested to see Dick Cheney's speech.  Maybe he will tell someone to "fuck off" or "go fuck yourself" again.  I should start working on my final technical writing assignment now; I have procrastinated enough.

      At 10:00 a.m. tomorrow I will just finished attending my last class at UW-Platteville.  The end is near.  This weekend will be spent working and writing a 12 to 20 page paper for my internship.  Apparently more internship hours = bigger paper.    Nevermind the fact I am only taking a four credit internship to make up for two credits I am lacking in my core requirements because senior seminar was once three credits and now is only one; I am getting screwed anyway.  With my first rejection e-mail under my belt, I am going to visit Lancaster School District's central office on Friday to copy my clips from the  Exponent  and work on cover letters for various jobs.  I am strongly considering sending applications to Idaho, the Washington peninsula, New York and Georgia.

      We have received your resume.  As of Friday, July 23, we have identified three strong candidates from which we feel we will get a person to fit our needs. Thus, we have suspended further interviews.  We appreciate your interest in the position. If the situation changes, we could be back in contact with you. We also will keep your resume on file in case other things open up in the near future.  Lee Fensin Sports Editor Waukesha Freeman   *  Too fricking bad I sent my resume on Sunday, July 25.  I guess I'll keep my fingers crossed that "the situation changes."  Maybe all three of the "strong candidates" will turn out to be followers of Osama or child molesters.

               I've noticed that on Tuesday mornings during "Sportscenter" ESPN prefers to remind us how many hours remain until new episodes of "The World Series of Poker" airs, instead of running the usual ticker of scores at the bottom of the screen.   Personally, I do not give a rats ass when new episodes of "The World Series of Poker" are going to begin.&nbsp; When I watch "Sportscenter" I want to see a ticker telling me&nbsp;if the Cardinals won,&nbsp;not a fricking countdown to new episodes of "The World Series of Poker."   50% of the people in America may have have a gambling problem and get off watching people they don't know win and lose colorful chips, but I am one of the 50% that doesn't.   For the 50% of Americans that don't&nbsp;care when new episodes of "The World Series of Poker" begin, ESPN should put the ticker back on the bottom of the screen during "Sportscenter."   Besides, the people interested in new episodes of "The World Series of Poker" aren't watching "Sportscenter" anyway; they're in a poker game betting their kid's tution because they're holding a pair of sevens.

      For the second consecutive Sunday I had an e-mail read on ESPN radio.&nbsp;   This week I asked Chris Mortensen the latest on the Mike McKenzie,&nbsp;&nbsp;writing, "What's the latest on the Mike McKenzie situation?&nbsp; My flag football team could use a cornerback and McKenzie would make us instant contenders.&nbsp; Should I try to sign him to an incentive-laden contract or will he be playing in the NFL this fall?"  I will try to make it three in a row next Sunday.

      "The Bottom Line," now with links galore!&nbsp; Thanks to Jay for helping me figure that out.   Thanks to those who voted for me to be part of the blognet.&nbsp; Those who didn't should become acquainted with the " urlLink vengeance scale ."&nbsp; My vengeance will be at about 9.3.   Today was uneventful.&nbsp; I went to philosophy, aced a quiz, went to technical writing and soaked up knowledge and came to work.   Here's to tomorrow!

      I met with "the man," Ed Deneen this morning.&nbsp; Things are always subject to change, but as of this morning it appears I will be receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree instead of the Bachelor of Science.   Mr. Deneen and I looked over my transcript and the three classes I thought would get me the nine extra credits in fact did.   I've already had a friend tell me that the B.A. doesn't mean squat.&nbsp;   I hope it does, as I have given up the right to use the "I got a B.S. degree from UW-Platteville" line&nbsp;for the rest of my life.   As the national media has already picked up on the  urlLink story , I might as well let you know...Kirsten Dunst and I are dating.   Kirsten and I met a few months ago at I.H.O.P. in Dubuque.&nbsp; Don't ask me what she was doing at the I.H.O.P. in Dubuque, but she was there.&nbsp; She was eating alone, so I thought I'd join her.&nbsp; We talked until I.H.O.P. closed and exchanged numbers.&nbsp; The rest is history.   We don't see each other much because of our busy schedules, but I am sure things will work out.&nbsp; When we are together every once in a while I will "accidentally" trip while carrying a bottle of water and spill it all over her chest.   There's nothing like seeing one of the best parts of the Spiderman films whenever I want.

      I received an A- on my resume, but I am still not happy with it.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow I have an 8:15 a.m. meeting with Ed Deneen.&nbsp; After looking over my degree report yesterday, I realized I may have taken classes that will enable me to pick up a Bachelor of Arts degree instead of a Bachelor of Science.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When I filled out my "intent to graduate" card I didn't think much of it and I don't think Dr. Ranney realized I may have had a chance at a B.A., so I am glad I stumbled upon this on my own.  &nbsp;  It would be nice if I could get the B.A., as I will have 185 credits after next week.  &nbsp;  25 hours and counting left on my WPVL internship, after which I will have officially completed my tour of duty with UW-Platteville.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;may apply for a job with the Waukesha Freeman as a night sports reporter.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could only figure out my cover letter, I am sure I would apply.  &nbsp;  Self-esteem has not traditionally been my strong&nbsp;point of mine, so it's tough for me to write a cover letter in which I am supposed to talk myself up to a potential employer.  &nbsp;  Time to play the waiting game, as commercial dubs are not down from WGLR yet.  &nbsp;  The waiting game sucks...let's play "Hungry Hungry Hippos."

      There were "shots fired" at Benchwarmers last night.&nbsp; I don't know any specifics, but my parents own a police scanner and heard about it.&nbsp; Apparently an Iowa county officer stopped the car of the shooter(s) about an hour later.  &nbsp;  Who says things aren't lively downtown&nbsp;during the summer?

      In what may very well be my 15 seconds of fame, an e-mail I sent to ESPN radio was just read by Dan Le Batard on his "ESPN&nbsp;The Magazine" show.  &nbsp;  On Sundays listeners&nbsp;can e-mail their questions to Chris Mortensen and Le Batard picks&nbsp;e-mails and poses the questions to Mortenson.  &nbsp;  Le Batard kicked off the e-mail segment saying, "There are a lot of Jamal Reynolds questions, and I think this one articulates the situation well for all the listeners out there..." and then read my e-mail.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I asked, "Will Jamal Reynolds be bagging groceries at a Hy-Vee near me soon, or will a NFL team pick him up?"  &nbsp;  Not as cool as Rob Spangler actually getting on the air, but I figure that was my 15 seconds of fame.

      Not only a staple of WCW programming, a weather phenomenon that is rocking WPVL house as I type.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Lots of work yesterday, which led to less time to blog.&nbsp; On the plus side, work=money, and I finished the first draft of my resume.  &nbsp;  As you've probably already read or heard, Kobe Bryant re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.&nbsp; I have been a Lakers fan since I was eight and will probably remain so next season, but it will be tough.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Jerry Buss and Mitch Kupchak destroyed what could have been a great team.&nbsp; With couple of role players around Kobe and Shaq, the team could have been a finals contender next season.&nbsp; Now, Kobe will be surrounded by over-the-hill Gary Payton and the j-brones picked up in the Shaq trade.&nbsp; Upgrade or downgrade?&nbsp; Downgrade, no doubt about it.  &nbsp;  Did you know the British Open golf tournament began yesterday?&nbsp; I sure as heck didn't.&nbsp; I didn't find out until I saw Phil Mickelson on the front page of  urlLink http://www.espn.com  yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; Tiger Woods is still somewhat in the hunt heading into the weekend.&nbsp; Maybe the golf "experts" will get off his back now.  &nbsp;  I have heard lots of buzz about NCAA Football 2005.&nbsp; If you own a PS2, I would say it's definitely worth a rental if you don't have the $50.00 to plunk down for it.  &nbsp;  I purchased Gallop Racer 2001 for the PS2 a little over a month ago.&nbsp; It was made by our fine friends at Tecmo.&nbsp; I love the game.&nbsp; I don't know much about horse racing, but the few times I've played the game a good time was had by all.  &nbsp;  I've found that I do pretty well when I hang back and then whip the snot out of the horse down the backstretch.&nbsp; But, that works with some horses and kills others.&nbsp; Each horse has their own strengths, weaknesses and characteristics.&nbsp; A very deep game, but should we expect anything less from the company that brought us Tecmo Super Bowl?  &nbsp;  HWY 151 between Platteville and Dickeyville will not be finished until June, 2005.&nbsp; The project was to be completed this fall, but the terrain is causing more problems than anticipated.&nbsp; That's a real kick in the&nbsp;pants&nbsp;to all UW-P students who utilized 151 to head to Dubuque to hit up Best Buy, Target, Kennedy Mall and so on.  &nbsp;  I may head to Dubuque tonight and hit up the aforementioned locations.&nbsp; The roads by the mall are a mess though, as some construction is going on.&nbsp; Oddly enough, I can never tell what it is.&nbsp; Cones and pylons are all over the place, but not much is being tore up.  &nbsp;  Weekend of work ahead, as always.&nbsp; I am missing out on a bachelor party golf outing and cookout to work at WPVL.&nbsp; I hope the place&nbsp;appreciates it.  &nbsp;  If you use blogger.com for your blogs, utilize the spell check once for a good laugh.&nbsp; Some of their suggestions are great.  &nbsp;  Have a safe weekend.

      A late night blog for the four readers.  Thank you to those who have stopped by and gave comments.  Thank you to Mike Lyons, Tino Kaltsas and Chad Henneman for giving my blog a link on their respective pages.  It is unfortunate that I cannot return the favor and add links to your blogs, as apparently I did not learn as much in Website Design and Development with S.K. Arkins as I thought I had.  If I had, I would be able to add links on freaking "blogger.com."    Just finished a school board meeting.  Not a terribly long meeting, we adjourned at 10:04 p.m., which is good considering we kicked off at 7:30 p.m.  I am trying to work on my resume so I can turn it in to Dr. Hadorn for Technical Writing tomorrow, but things aren't going very well.  My notes are in my car and all doors will lock behind me as I leave the building, so basically I am sunk.  I will have to get up early tomorrow morning and use a WPVL computer to make some progress before Karmann library opens.  I have learned that there is a George Smith way to do a resume and a Peter Hadorn way to do a resume.  Actually, I am sure there are thousands of ways to do a resume, but Dr. Smith's and Dr. Hadorn's ideas were in stark contrast.  Dr. Smith was fine with a "bare bones" resume, in that dates and places worked were all one needed.  Dr. Hadorn feels with each place worked one should speak to what they accomplished in that job.  His feeling is if one doesn't tell the reader what one has accomplished, how will they know?  Either way, my resume is a mess.  As summer school winds down it is beginning to sink in that I will not be returning to UW-Platteville in the fall for classes.  Walking in May was somewhat bittersweet because I knew there was more left I had do to.  Now as I struggle through my resume and look at potential jobs, I am realizing that it is time for me to really start learning in the "real world."  A parting shot...  Shaquille O'Neal will be the NBA MVP next season.  Remember you read it here first.

      Not only a great movie starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer, but a product of the sun which is making its presence clear yesterday and today.  It's not a good thing when people start sweating while sitting around.  Yesterday I saw UW-Platteville Chancellor David Markee outside his office!  I kid you not!  I was in the walkway between Gardener and Boebel and looked down to see the chancellor coming out of Boebel.  I feel fortunate to have seen the chancellor outside his office.  That's right up there with finding Waldo.  Here's a nickel's worth of free advice to those who buy DVD's.  If you want to purchase a DVD the day it is released or soon after, don't.  Odds are another version with even more special features will be released down the road.  For example, I have purchased  Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ,  Rain Man ,  Speed  and  Spiderman  only to have another version be released afterward.  In a lot of cases the extras included with the new version don't amount to much, but in the case of  Speed  there were extras I would have liked to have had on the "old" version.  I know that people in the DVD industry have to put food on their plates too, but some of the re-releases are shameful.  Take  The Bourne Identity  for example.  Today a new version of  The Bourne Identity  is hitting shelves, complete with new extras and a brand new beginning and ending to the movie.  Why couldn't that be put on the DVD the first time?  Of course the answer to that question doesn't matter when one realizes the re-release definitely correlates with  The Bourne Supremacy  hitting theaters in a couple of weeks.  But as Jack O'Neil taught everyone on the first day of each of his classes, it's all about the almighty dollar.  Jack O'Neil was a smart man.

      Class is done for today, so I'll toss out some thoughts.  If you're counting, that makes two blogs for me today, which is more than Kevin Garthwaite has blogged in the last two months.  To complete my tour of duty at UW-Platteville I am taking Into to Philosophy and Technical Writing this summer, in addition to completing an internship.  Dr. Shane Drefcinski is teaching the Intro to Philosophy class.  "Dr. D" really knows his stuff.  He has tossed in many pop culture and sports references along with the philosophy and it has helped keep the class interesting.  Dr. Peter Hadorn is teaching Technical Writing.  Like Dr. Drefcinski, another man that really knows his stuff.  Tomorrow the class is covering resumes, so I am looking forward to it.  I would recommended Dr. Drefcinski's or Dr. Hadorn's classes to you, but most potential readers of this blog have already graduated from UW-Platteville, or have jumped off the UW-P ship altogether and transferred.  I have seen  Spiderman 2  and  Dodgeball  this summer and I would give them both a thumbs up.  Seeing both was money well spent, which is tough to say about some movies today as it costs almost $10 to view one, depending on where you go.  As a Lakers fan I am disappointed with the news Shaquille O'Neal is heading to the Miami Heat.  In my opinion who Los Angeles is receiving in return isn't going to blow anyone's skirt up, so it will be interesting to see how things play out.  I will still contend that Mitch Kupchak should have told Shaq to "suck it up" and play for the Lakers and if Shaq didn't like it he could sit out.  Oh well, that's why Mitch Kupchak is a NBA general manager and I am not.

      The  Courier Press  in Prairie du Chien called yesterday while I was at work.  I called back this morning and I have a meeting Monday afternoon.  I heard back from a friend that lives in Winona.  She said that I should definitely apply at the  Winona Daily News .  Decisions, decisions.  I really have no idea how to handle a job search.  Too bad UW-P didn't offer a class titled "Job Searching 101."

      No bloggings since Sunday comes as a result of not having access to a computer.  I am one of the 1,487 people in the world that does not have a computer at home.  Fortunately the "new and improved" WPVL has computers all over the place, so I will make a quick post.  I am waiting for a letter of rejection from  Blue White Illustrated  and word from the  Courier Press  in Prairie du Chien.  I received a letter from UW-P today informing me that I have completed my requirements to graduate and will be receiving my diploma in 10 to 12 weeks.  I found this odd, as I still have two waiver forms I thought I had to fill out for the communication department.  I may apply for a job in Winona, Minnesota at the  Winona Daily News .  Should I end up in Winona I'll have to write a features piece about the man that is Tino Kaltsas.

      My horoscope yesterday, from the  Wisconsin State Journal   -----   Today's Birthday (Aug. 7).   During the coming year, you'll have plenty of opportunities to use your talent and experience to gain material things.  You'll also get to pay an old debt, and that will make you feel much better.  -----  I would provide you with what my horoscope from the  Telegraph Herald  had to say, but it has gone missing from WPVL.  My birthday was alright.  I worked from 9 until 2.  Then I worked on my cover letter and resume to  Blue White Illustrated , the magazine that covers Penn State.  I am mailing that today.  When I finished my cover letter and resume I went home to eat.  My mom made steak, shrimp and baked potatoes for supper.  The meal also included salad and rolls.  It was great.  My mom can really cook.  Following supper I watched part of the Packer scrimmage before switching over to  Resident Evil  on the Sci-Fi channel.  The  Telegraph Herald  T.V. guide gave it only one star, but I didn't think it was that bad.  It was loosely based on the video game, but still featured a lot of zombies, which is what  Resident Evil  is all about.  Today I will write a cover letter for a job with the  Prarie du Chien Courier .  Thanks to Dan Moris for giving me a heads up on that one.  Back to the "Sunday Morning Worship Cavalcade" on AM 1590, WPVL.

      On this date in 1979 I was born.  In case you did not major in math, that makes me 25 today.  Officially I do not turn 25 until 10:16 p.m., so this my last blog as a 24-year-old.  My 24th year was an eventful one.  I'll leave it at that.  My 25th year could be filled with a lot of changes depending on if/when I get a job.  I worked this week and otherwise took it easy.  I made a trip to Madison on Wednesday and checked out West Town, Best Buy and such.  A good time was had by all.  Thanks to all who have offered job tips.  I am currently looking into working for Prarie du Chien's paper, being a drifter in Arizona and moving in with Chad Henneman.

      I slid my internship final paper under the door of the communications office this afternoon.  While doing so I noticed the internship papers I slid under the door yesterday were in the same place.  Brian West was in the Exponent office, so I asked him if Becky Troy had passed away.  He let me know Becky was on vacation all week.  Too bad no one in the department felt it necessary to put up a note to let interested parties know.  Brian borrowed a key and got me into the office so I could get my portfolio.  As a result, I will be sending my clips and resume to Penn State tomorrow or Thursday.  With the exception of two waiver forms I need to fill out, I won't have to deal with UW-Platteville anytime in the foreseeable future.

      Apparently no one in the UW-Platteville communications department works in the afternoon.    I have stopped by every 30 minutes since 2:15 p.m. because I need to turn in my internship papers and I need my newswriting portfolio back so I can send my resume and portfolio to Penn State.  I slid my internship papers under the door, but that doesn't help me get my portfolio back.  Oh well, it's not like it's a big deal.  There's only a job at stake.
