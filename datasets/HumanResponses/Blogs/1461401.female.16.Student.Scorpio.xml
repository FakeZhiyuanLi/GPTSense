      So not much has happened within the few hours of my semi-consciousness... Yeah, I realize this must be really boring for you, but at least you don't have to live it, and besides, it's not like I'm making you read this. I could find out where you live, and tie you down to a chair and make you read it. I'm strong, and good with knots, but I don't because I'm a nice person. Remember that... or else... XD Me

      So here I am...once again. Man am I tired. Oh well. TACA got canceled again today, due to lack of people showing up. That's not good. Oh well, we'll get it together. We always do. If you have the chance, you need to come and see The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged. If you can't, I sincerly pitty you. Seriously, it's one of the funniest plays I've ever seen in my entire life. Trust me on tis, and just go see it. Things are still different, not that I expected them to change back... I guess I was just hoping. Oh well, theres still time. Not that it will ever be the same again, but there's always hope. Band gets to play at Kobacher (sp?) on tuesday. That'll be cool. I still hate band, but I don't know if I can really quit or not. And I'm not just talking about whether or not my parents will let me, I mean whether or not I'll let myself. Oh well, there's still time to think on that too. My left arm hurts, so I'm going to go now. Ttyl ya'll Me

      Oh well. Yeah, things are definitely not the same, but at least they're better. School's going well. Only 21 more days until it's over. Well, twenty now that today is over. We're starting these cool projects in science, but I think I'm going to work alone on this one. Mine's going to rock the house... :-D I'm so tired. Kinda bored too. We have these huge projects in english due next week. I really should work on them... Man, I'm so tired I can't type right. I've had to redo sentences like five times by now. I miss ben. We're talking right now. He's such a sweety... :-D Well I think I'm done here. Don't really have anything important to say anyway. ONE WEEK TILL MATRIX! Yeah, that's it. Kristin

      So. Things have changed. I changed them. I called him. We talked. Things have changed. I can never undo the things I did, but maybe, just maybe, we can stay the same... or at least, as close to it as possible. Oh well.  I have tried my best And although I may fail I'm not giving up  ~Me

      I'm in a strangly better mood today. Seriously, I don't understand why. Nothing's changed, maybe I'm finally just starting to accept it. Ha. Acually I'm trying to make the problem go away, so maybe that's why I'm feeling better. Will it ever be fixed? Doubt it. Oh well, it happens. Ben just got on. I miss him. He's fun to talk to. I LOVE ELLIOTT SMITH! IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS YOU'RE NUTS AND YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT! He's a singer, and he's really incredible. He's like a mix of radiohead, the beatles, and coldplay. A very good mix. He had a song in The Royal Taunenbaums. I don't think I spelled that right, but I could care less. Guys at our school piss me off, but that's not going to change anytime soon, so oh well. I think I've rambled on long enough for now, so I'll just be leaving... yup... here I go... just watch me... Bye Me

      Wow am I tired. Well, I guess this is my new blog. It's about time it started working. I was trying to setit up yesterday, but it totally failed. Sure as hell made me feel good. So today was a pretty interesting day. I mean, not the school part. That was  pretty mediocre, as usual, but the after school part was pretty fun. We got to paint the glass hallway for drama, and that was very cool. It turned out really great. Jess did such a good job with the letters. Mom and Dad are all worried about me because they think I'm becoming too depressed and I won't tell them why. They wouldn't get it. And besdies, I don't feel like talking about this one. If I talk about it, it will only be with one person, no that that's ever going to happen... No comments, thank you. Emma wrote me, she's doing a bit better than she was... Ben has been talking to me online and that makes me happy because I miss him! I'm just ramblng on now, so yeah, I think I'm gonna go. I'll be back...   Maybe Kristin

       I'm screaming out in rage With my life down on a page Being read by blind eyes Who never quite realize That I'm a human being Living, breathing, seeing The wrong person knows it all They break through my concrete wall They have the sacred book But they'll never take a look Just hang it over my head Making me jump, fall, or be dead But they can't read inside For fearing what covers hide Not wanting to read their name so many times Or my wasted words and rhymes So they just swing the silver knife Enjoying my pain, blood and strife But I know more than they ever will What it's like to have blood spill So go ahead, slash again You can't ever hurt me again You can't ever hurt me again You can't ever hurt me again Not if I forget your name first

      Wow am I tired. I got up at 6:30 and then went to go babysit my little cousin and Lilly. Now I have to admit, it was worth it. Seeing them play together is sooo cute, but still, I'm so tired right now. I think I'm going to go see The Matrix tonight...but I'm not really sure... we'll just have to see how that goes. I'll work on my stupid project tomorrow. Stupid project. grrrr Oh well It happens and it will happen just like it did last time ~Kristin (I miss ben!!!)

      I just got back from the second showing of the play. It was just as good, maybe even a little better, eccept for the crazy lil bia who was picked to scream. She wasn't nneeaarr as good as me. Butt love...heeheehee, that's priceless. I finally got my Anthem project turned in (it was due today) but I still have my midevil project thing due tuesday and I'm no where near done with that. I realized tonight how much I miss the way things were before my incredible stupidity. I mean, things have gotten much better, almost back to the way things once where, but it's still different. Dylan licked me. I had to lick her back to get me to stop... not my proudest moment, but I washed my hands afterwards, so I'm ok... I hope... Oh god, is that a wart where she licked me?!?!? heeheehee, sorry dylan ~Kristin

      Oh god my feet hurt! I was wearing these kick ass boots today... with one slight problem. OUCH!!! I guess it's just because I had to walk home in them, but come on. I've walked home in my coming home (no pun intended) shoes and they didn't hurt half as bad as these. Well, ok, the play was to die for. I mean, honestly, it was just that funny! That's pretty much all my friends and I were talking about today. Juliet (joe) to Romeo (rob) "Dude, I don't want to kiss you." (later) Romeo to Juliet "Call me but love-" Juliet "Butt love?!" You see what I mean? You have to go see it! RUN! RUN! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!  Shibang Me P.S. I miss ben

      GGAAHH!!! THIS IS SO STUPID! Why is the freshman band playing a song with a person from symphonic playing the lead?!?! Why aren't we playing something that we as a freshman band CAN PLAY?? Aren't we supposed to showing off OUR talents?!?!? UUGGHH!!! IT MAKES ME SO MAD. And to top it off we as the freshman band can hardly even play the parts we're given! This is a really stupid decision on the directors part... grrrrr... I want to get all my homework done before the concert, so that's what I'm gonna do now.  Peace Kristin

      Ugh. I hate it when Kari and I don't get along. Sometimes we just can't see eye to eye, and we always blame the other person, but I don't know. Maybe it was my fault, maybe it was hers. Either way it didn't improve my over all mood for the day. I went to the office today to ask for a change of schedule form, only to realize all I need to do to give them a note. From my parents. Shit. I can't stay in band, I just can't. Not one of my friends could convice me to stay in anymore, not a single one. It's just not worth it. I need to find a way out... I don't know, I'll have to work on it. I'm finally working on one of my english projects, it's about time... ugh. Me

      Ahhh, yet another day gone. It was a pretty good day, I must admit, even though I didn't get anything done that I had meant to. Mom and I went shopping and that was fun. Church was good. I help out in the nursery with the 2-3 year olds. They're usually pretty cute, until one of them starts being bad, but they're young, it happens. I have two english projects due soon. One due friday and the other next monday. I don't have much done for them. I might have to work on that. I've been listening to TLC Crazy Sexy Cool latly. If you haven't got it, but like TLC I really recommend you get it while you can. It's old, but really good. Can't you tell I just lloovvee rambling on? I thougt so. It doesn't really matter to me though, so oh well. Tomorrow is school. I don't know how I feel about that. I'm kind of upset, because I know Mark and I aren't really friends anymore, and even though it is really my own fault, it still kinda hurts. Oh well, it happens. It's probably better for him we're not friends anyway, so at least it's not a lose-lost situation we have on our hands. I'm gonna go do something productive... meh, who am I kidding?

      Well, it's saturday morning, and I have no plans. I figure the less plans you have the better, then all the less plans that can be broken. That and the fact that I had a really stressful week, so I'm gonna take some much needed R+R. Cold coffee isn't good if you were expecting it to be hot... X-P The drama banquet is this week, that'll be really fun. I just feel like I ought to have some sort of escort or something, you know, like the Oscars. I mean, I'm not up for any awards or anything, but it would still be fun to go with someone. I know who I'm thinking of, but that just makes me want to ask him even less... you know? I don't want to seem like I'm flirting or anything... so I'll pretty much just end up not going with my friends, just sitting with them. Oh well, it's all good. Maybe I can finally go get those sun glasses today... not that they'll do much good in this weather...damn clouds. Oh well. It's all good. Wow, I just said that. Oh well...ummm, yeah. :-P Kristin

I mean, I failed my science project, and I didn't get those sun glasses I wanted, but I'm still having a good day. It's like, I don't know, it just doesn't matter. I'm still having a good day. I think it's just because of the three day weekend. Oh well, it's all good. For once. Kristin

Kari, the only reason I'm not talking to you right now is so I DON'T SAY WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY TO YOU! GOD DAMN IT, YOU HAVE TO STOP! YOU ARE THE MOST IMMATURE PERSON I'VE EVER MET! You make me madder than I have been in so long. Now don't think that I'm just being angst, or that this has anything to do hormones. I'M MAD AT YOU. ACCEPT IT. DEAL WITH IT. You've ruined so many things for me. It's kind of hard for me to not be mad at you. ~Me

I kinda doubt it's gonna happen, but hey, at least we're trying. Everything is all better with friends, so that's cool. I'm "working" on my damn project for english. Actually I really am getting some work done on it, so that's good. I found a couple sites that will really save me ass. So yeah. I miss Ben. Today is a better day.

Katie was still around back then. Yeah, fifth grade. Enrichment. Good friends. I suppose I ought to say something worth reading, but that's not going to happen, trust me. Man this isn't even worth typing, so I'm gonna stop wasting both our time, even if it is just for my own selfish reasons. Meh, it happens. ~Kristin

      So yeah, today cassie and I decided we should do something for the festival of the arts next year. Well, I asked if she would dlay guitar and back me up on this one song and she agreed. Very cool. I would tell you the song, but that would be giving away the surprise. Of course, you'll probably hear about it by next year... but oh well, like I really give a damn. Tomorrow, there will just be one more week of school. Of course, it also happens to be the shittiest week of school. Exams. The school year is all wrong. The second to last week of school should be for exams, whereas the last week should be a total blowoff. You know what I mean? Of course you do. And if you don't, do you really think I care? Yeah, I don't. Geeze. Who do you think I am? You're mom? God, just leave me alone. Bitch.  Ok, that was weird. Sorry about that. Well I'm gonna go before things get even weirder... yeah, too late for that. ~Me

      I may stay up all night tonight. I may wander throughout the days in a sleepless sort of fuzz. I may just walk away one day, without saying a word, and it will be all your fault. No one ever fights for what they believe in anymore, they just leave things be, hoping that they'll fix themselves. No one would care though. They would just assume I'd come back one day. Everyone just assumes I'll be back one day. But they never try to look for me.  Now there's something to think about.

      How is it that when I'm mad I'm the most weak? Maybe it's because of who I'm mad at. I'm mad at someone I, until recently, was rather fond of... I hate being mad at people who don't deserve it. Especially since I can't really be mad at anyone but myself for this. I'm tearing myself apart on the inside. Isn't that from a song? It sound familliar. It's just like, I check my e-mail everyday even though I know he won't e-mail me anymore. I check my buddylist everytime I hear someone log on, even though even if it is him I know he won't IM me. Or if he does, I won't respond. I just don't want to get hurt again. I don't want to hurt anyone again. I don't know what I want. I hate it when I do that. I could just say I'm sorry and go on living in some sort of blind happiness. Or I could stay quiet, and loose another one, but still loose the risk of getting hurt. I don't know. Relationships aren't really my speciality.  I'm sorry, but shut up anyway  Me

      My eyes are a sickly shade of gray, which totally represents how I feel today. Oh god, I feel so friggin alone. I was out partying with all these people, but so few of my friends. And yesterday...well... it didn't help. God, I just need someone to talk to. I need a hug. I need a big hug, and a shoulder to cry on. I so incredibly hate my life. I wish I could just disappear. I would go to the park and sit for a while, but the mosquitos are getting bad. Yeah, it's summer alright. God I need a hug. I need everything to be ok again. "Jump in the river, what do I see?

And then they had to leave so it was just me and Mark again and that was even more fun XD Sorry, I just can't really help it there. I'm getting mad. I'm talking to someone who I really shouldn't be, and I'm remembering why I shouldn't talk to him.... grrrrr... Oh well, he doesn't effect me (other than getting me mad) So yeah, I'm done here.

      Wow, the strangest things have been happening to me today. It's like my brain has just shut down! I'm making so many spelling mistakes (not that you would know, I correct them all) and it's like I can't talk! I mix up words, letters, anything. I guess I'm just a little tired. I'm worried about thursday and friday. Finals. Ugh. Oh well, after that nothing but rest, relaxation, and watching lilly. For the rest of the summer. I know some friends and I are supposed to get together sometime soon and go see the Matrix again, but I don't know when that's going to happen. Nothing planned nothing planned, lalala, nothing planned :-D That's just the way I like it. I'm sure sometime this summer I'm going to go visit dad (which will be cool) and I'm still hoping Katie or Emma (or both) can come up and see me. Other than that... I got nothin :-D ~I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after~ Me

      Petals pounding Mind racing Breath rasping But at least I'm getting away I had to run Had to get away Or else I don't know I just don't know I hear shouts But they're just in my head Seeing lights that aren't really there I'm just here Running away Riding away Fading away And I'm so scared Scared of what you'll do to me If you get your hands on me again If I hear you say those deadly words Again So for now I'll stick with running Stick with riding Not stop fading From your memory

      Here I am. Sunday morning, sitting in my bathrobe with a cup of coffee and small pile of cookies (for dunking, of course). I'm listening to Kari's voice drifting through the speakers. Damn her, I thought I was the one with the nice voice in that family. I don't like being proved wrong. Another bite of coffee-cookie and all is well in the life of Kristin. I got a new phone yesterday, which is very good cause I needed one. Ben's coming up to visit me. :-D Good times. This is the last week of school. We might go see Nemo tonight (I hope we do) That would be fun. Well then, I think I'm about done here. That was just a bit of an update about me. So yeah See ya'll around on the other side

      I feel like I've lost something. Like a peice of me is gone. I don't know what it is, it just isn't there...   I haven't been able to cry. Not since the night I called mark. Since the night dad told me we're leaving. I just haven't been able to cry, no matter what happened. I didn't cry, not even when Ben told me he found a girlfriend. Not when I told my friends what was going on. Not when I realized what might happen to me...   I feel hardened. Like nothing can get in anymore. Apathetic. Like even if something really good happened to me right now, I'm not sure I would smile. If I cut myself right now, if I could cry. Tears well up in my eyes, but something suppresses them. I feel like...   Like I've lost my soul.

        You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You are an IDEALISTIC VIRGIN.    urlLink   What Kind of Virgin Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Hmm, maybe I'd better keep those in mind the next time someone asks how many boyfriends I've ever had... (take a guess, it's none)    You're the smirk,a frown-smile hybrid that's a little bit cocky and usually associated with evil or arrogant,but attractive people.You probably just don't give a damn,but it's everyone else's fault if you don't because you're too awesome to have any real faults.    urlLink   What Kind of Smile are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ok, now that one I like

      Mr. Saxiphone player "You were scared of being abandoned so you abandoned them. You distanced yourself from the whole thing... I am both of them. I am neither." Spike "You think I'm Vicious?

      I start crying. I don't know why. I've been watching anime. The heros have people who care about them. It's just a cartoon. I start crying. I really have chosen the path of safety. It's right, I know it is. But it feels so wrong. It feels so empty. I can't come out of the dark though. I've been in there for so long now, it's all I know. The light is painful, the dark is familliar. I wish I were someone who could just pick up and walk away. Someone less empathic than me. I wish I could be like Spike, or Vash. Someone who isn't me. Just pick up and walk away, and forget what I've left behind. The road of the wanderer. The mind of a wonderer. Damn it all. And damn you too.

      While watching Daria, I realized something important, that totally cancels out my last two updates. Screw hypocracy. *insert evil grin here* I'm a teenage girl and I'm allowed to speak my mind. I only pity the people who have to put up with me. But that doesn't mean I'm going to change. So what if I'm a hypocrit, who isn't in this screwed up thing we call life *insert evil laugh here, here, and here* Another update of the happiest shitty hypocrit you'll ever meet. )8-D  And hey, if you really "luv" someone, isn't it worth it to spell out the whole word? (Just something Mark once pointed out to me)

      *bangs head on desk* I hate myself. That and the fact that Amber's going to Maumee Bay today and I can't because I'm babysitting. That and the fact that he has been on twice today and said nothing, AND YET IT STILL BOTHERS ME!!! What the hell is wrong with me? It's like I need to have control over people. I need to feel like people like me, even when it's him. Grrr. I wish mark or steven were on. Another day in the life of a shitty hypocrit.

      I just realized something terrible. I am the hypocrit. I insult him, and then say he gives up too easily. I finally got rid of him, which was my main goal...   For the past three months I've been trying to get rid of him. I'd send him a random message, always curt, and never starting with just Hi. I wanted to make him fight for me, to make him prove that he really wanted me. And most of all to make him hurt. I would watch my buddy list without blinking when he was on, waiting for him to send me a message. A usual "love you" or "miss you" But it hurted the most when those messages stopped all together.   Isn't this what I wanted? I don't have to worry about creepy guys anymore. I don't have to worry about wheither or not I could say no, because he's lost the will to ask. Isn't that what I was going for? I don't have to worry about wheither or not I'm lying when I tell him I love him, because he doesn't say it to me anymore. I don't have to worry about feeling lonely or empty when he goes off to college.   Because that's what I'm feeling now.

      Interesting day. Helped out with mom's summer reading program by handling snakes. It was so friggin cool. The biggest one I held was a boa named stash, 5 foot four inches. She was cool. Tried to go up my sleeve though, and that made me feel a little freaked out... understandably. The best part though, was Steve came with me. Man, I haven't seen him hardly at all for an entire year! But I asked if he wanted to help, and he said yes! God, I had forgotten how much I miss him. And afterwards, mom took us out to lunch, and he was so funny! Honestly, the only other time I had seen him outside of school was at the play, and he wasn't with him. Mom gave he permission to marry him, lol. Something to remember, cyclops' can only have a unibrow. :-D Yeah, good times. I don't want it to end... Ugh, this is gonna be one hell of a summer... :-( No ones talking to me!!!! ~Kristin  Later~ I hate hypocrits. The kind of people who say they love you, but give you up so easily.

      I'd really like to give up right about now. I dont' know why. Maybe it's because I've finally realized what's really going to happen to me. All the promises I've made that I haven't kept. All the promises I've made myself that have almost killed me. All the terrible things I've done, and all the ones I'm capible of doing. What's really going to happen. Who I'm leaving. What I'm losing. Who doesn't really care...  I think that's what hurts the worst. Who doesn't really care.  But then again...  Why should I?  One question still haunts my mind.  How little of a difference do I really make?  Would you really care if you never saw me again?

      I'm tired. This is probably the most I've ever been up in one morning without having to go to school. Oh well, it all works out.  I'm thinking of taking lilly downtown today since her swimming lessons are canceled. Poor baby, and she was so looking forward to them. It's raining. It's such a peaceful, lovely rain.  I like this kind of rain.  I still have to call cassie to see if she wants to go too. Mark's trying to get his licence today. GOOD LUCK! not that you read this... Oh well. Sophie is stalking birds through the window. It's a good thing she can't get out, or she'd never come back. She'd have too much fun terrorizing the neighborhood flocks. Such a darling little savage. I'll be back later, right now I have to see a man about a horse.  ~Me

      I think of something I did this morning that reminded me of mark, and I start laughing. Loud. Lilly comes in and asks what's so funny. I don't know. She starts laughing too. We just laugh.  I start singing a song my sister wrote. It's so beautiful. Ask her about it, she'll send you a copy. It makes me think of...well... the past. People I've ended up hurting, while only trying to save them from myself. It made me cry. Me. Cry.   Could it be that I am fixed?

      Lol, once again I wake up to hear the phone ring. Oh well, at least this time it's grandma. Man, I haven't slept this late in ages, but it feels good. And considering I was out pretty late last night, totaly excusable.  But oh man, after the movie last night we drove to the Maumee River and tried (ha) to make a bonfire. That didn't really pan out, so we ended up just sitting in the dark and watching the stars. It was so beautiful. The ripples on the river reflected the stars in the sky and the sounds of all the wild things nearby. Very peacful. It was funny to see everyone in their make shift Lort Of The Rings costume. It really was a spur of the moment thing, so none of ours was that great. I'd have to say Rob's was the best. But still, I've never seen the stars that well in Ohio. It's funny how you can look to the stars for hours on end, and never get bored. Something about them just makes you...think.   Well I'm gonna go have some lunch. ~Your own personal starry eye dreamer

      I wake up to hear the phone ring. At nine o'clock in the morning. At 9:03 or so, another call comes through. At 9:13 I'm slamming down the phone again. Three telemarketers before nine fifteen...   And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

      Wow, so this is the new blogging system. Please excuse any typing errors you might find, but I'm not wearing my contacts right now and I'm not sure where my glasses are so in all honesty I can't read the screen. It can actually be kind of fun trying to figure out what's being said on different sites, but I've been to some of the ones so many times I would navigate them blind... Heh, like any of this matter.  Oh well, it happen. Well I'm going to make myself talk about things that matter then I really don't know what to say. You know what's sad? When a babysitter sees more of a child than their parent does. Yeah. That would suck...  I guess I'm done here. Sorry about the whole me wasting your time thing.  Meh, like I really care.  ~Kristin

      Whenever I'm on the computer I always have my headphones on. I'm always listening to whatever music I like at the time. Mom says I listen to my music too loudly. Whenever she needs me she always ends up screaming her head off just to get me to turn around. But that's why I listen to my music so loud. So I can't hear her screaming. So much fighting at my house, I get sick of it. We're not a disfunctional family or anything, we all love eachother very much, and know it...but there's always those little things that get in the way. The little things that make us scream our heads off and make the children cry. Mom says I listen to my music too loud, but that doesn't matter. I can't hear her say it anyway.

I just hope those thunderstorms in Dayton didn't dampen anyones spirits for that big music festival that I can't find a single peice of information on AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY! Ok, ok, I'm ok. I'm just going through a bit of stress right now... *twitches* Yeah that's another thing. My left eye has been twitching for the whole day and I don't know why.

      MMaann I had that weirdest dream last night. I dreamed that a whole bunch of drama people were in my house, and we were all upstairs in my parents room because I needed to use the computer in there. Only, Mark had to use it first so I let him (being the good hostess that I am) but he had to creat a new account on some website... I dunno. So while we were waiting for him to finish we were watching this weird kids show (it might have actually been south park) and finally he was done but when he had logged off he had actually logged off of the desktop account... you know what I mean? Well anyway I didn't know the pass word for the family account so Kari and I were freaking out and all the kids started fighting, like, violently when all of the sudden G walks in! She had this big smile on like she didn't notice anyone was fighting...and then lilly woke me up. I think it means I'm having drama withdrawal symptoms. (that and I should never let mark get on my computer without constant supervision) Heehee. Man, I'm still pretty tired. COFFEE TIME!!! "Coffee is for wimps." "So I'm a wimp! NOW GIMME MY COFFEE!" Heeheehee, Rob knows what I'm talking about. ;-)   So tired...  ~Me

      Catching fireflies with lilly makes me kind of nostalgic. I remember the days when Katie still lived here, and we would spend late nights with out butterfly nets having competitions to see how many fire flies we could catch. Or when Kari Mom and I would go sit on the porch and watch the sun set while the little yellow flickers start to come out. Those were the really good days. Curtis Avenue, Conneaut, and Katie. Probably the best times. I remember the one time I stayed up till 5:30 in the morning at Jenn's birthday party to wake everyone up so we could watch the sun rise, only to fall asleep minutes before it came up. Lol, we had so much sugar that night, and you know we played all those silly games like truth or dare where the main question was "who do you have a crush on?" only to be followed by a squeal of giggles. Yeah, those were the good times. The best part is though, they're not over yet. I still have so much time and so many great friends, more than I realize. More than I appriciate, I'm sure. Well you know what I say?  Let the good times roll :-D

Incase you haven't checked them out yet... DO IT! JUST DO IT DAMNIT! WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM!? There, I'd done my part in spreading Flogging Molly awarness. In case you haven't been able to notice, I'm not quite in my right mind this morning. Or is it afternoon yet...? I don't know. Don't really care right now. I read the 5th harry potter yesterday. Man that was good. Well, ok, I finished it yesterday. I started it the day before. :-D I'm such a geek. Oh well, it's not like I have any kind of social life to distract me from reading... *glares evily* Oh well. Man, I still keep thinking about friday night. It was like, the best time I've had all summer. "Oooh, Kristin's puttin on the moves" "Shut up mork" heeheehee, good times had by all. Except for maybe Maggie...? Maggie, if you're reading this, are you ok? I hope so. Heh-heh, and amber forgot any kindling for the fire. Wow, that was pricless.

      Admit it cassie, you are spanking yourself. rockcandy1419 (10:32:17 PM): well...if i told you id have to kil you  Heeheehee.  I'm too tired to be mad right now. Tune in in a couple of hours. Maybe I'll be pissed off again by then. Oasis is a good band. I'm not just now realizing this, I'm just now listening to the music. I knew they were good, I just didn't listen to them. If only I could find that CD.......  God I'm tired. I had a good dream about Jeff Corwin last night. Emily (Keegan) had connections so she made it so I could go with him. We were swimming in Lake Conneaut. It's like, all the playground equipment was still there, just submerged in water. And there were all these really cool fish. Man, he could swim fast. Made me feel slow, and I'm a pretty good swimmer. Then I broke his cameras and I thought he was going to get really mad at me... but he didn't... I dunno. Then we were going back to shore (the parking lot) when dad woke me up and told me I had to get up because the realitors were showing the house at 10. Damn them all for interrupting my good dream. Man those fish were cute. It wasn't nearly as weird as the dream with cassie and tracy though. Woodstock was there too... I'll get into that one later. For now, I think I'm just gonna go back to sleep...  Mmmm, sleep.  rockcandy1419 (10:43:29 PM): i want mark's dick? rockcandy1419 (10:44:37 PM): hehe...he would enjoy it...

      Sometimes I get so depressed I scare myself. Terrible thoughts race through my head. I can't see because my eyes are so blinded by my own self hate. Self pity.  Sometimes life just isn't fair. God damnit, I'll show you not fair. Sometimes things don't go your way? Yes, but things might just get a little more difficult from now on, so watch your ass. And while we're at it, watch your damn mouth.  Grrr. Now I'm mad too. This has been a fun week...........grrrrrrrr.........

      I try to swallow. I start choking. That taste. I know it. Blood. I start coughing until I can breathe again. What's happening? I look down at my hands. Red. Blood. Blood dripping from my hands. Into my eyes. I scream.  I wake up, panting. Dark clouds swirl before my eyes. I'm in my room. It was just a dream...but then, why is my little light on? I look around... everything seems normal. But then I look at my hands again. The blood. The blood is still there! Where could it have come from? I hear a moan, and my body freezes. Something, laying next to my bed on the floor. Oh god. What have I done? I look at him, his eye glazed over, gasping for one last breath. It's him. I... I killed him. I rub my eyes, smearing the blood into them. The more blood gets into my eyes, the more the vision fades. At last, it is all gone...  But not forgotten.

      "Honey you are a rock, upon which I stand. And I come here to talk. I hope you understand. The green eyes, yeah the spot light shines upon you. How could anybody deny you? Cause I came here with a load, and it feels so much lighter now I met you. And honey you should know, that I could never go on without you."  My boy with green eyes. Not really my boy. Never was my boy. Never will be my boy. Never wanted to be my boy. Never intended to be my boy.  So why does it still hurt? I have a boy now. A boy who loves me. "Cause everybody wants everybody else." Damnit. I just want to stop wanting. I'm happy with what I have god damn it!  But what I don't have is killing me... "Cause everybody wants everybody else."  except me.

      It's funny, how the most sane, stable person can snap just so easily. And the ones that seem the craziest are the ones who show the least emotion.  My lip gives an involuntary quiver. A pain flashes in my chest. A chill races through my body. I know I'm losing it, but I don't know why.  My eyes half close. My body stiffens. My muscles tensen. What are you trying to do to me...  ...friend...

      I gotta tell you right now I don't feel like living up to my name. I don't feel starry eyed. I don't feel like a dreamer. Right now, I feel...   All those dark little swirls outlining the farthest parts of your soul. The parts you wish you could forget was there. The ones that make you revengful, or bitter, or spiteful. The swirls are getting bigger. Darker. Reacher farther out than their previous confinments. My body is rigid in a kind of fixed hatred. I just stare. And stare. I see you. Not moving. Not saying a word. While I'm sceaming all the things I've ever wanted to say to you. In my head. Where you are still protected from the truth.  For now. The swirls are getting bigger. Darker. Clouding my eyes with what I don't want to see. My mind enters the bittersweet confines of contempt.   Thanks for the help... friend...

      I warned you to not read, but you came anyway. Damn you. I have heard about you. I heard about the things you do to the "inferior", and what you dream in your sleep. I have heard about the sickly shade of green your eyes turn when things don't go your way. Well I damn you again. Don't you come back here, or else I might get mad again, and if you remember what happened last time, you'll remember that neither of us came out well in the end. So go on! Git! Run away like the cursed dog you are. Beware of the violet eyes, glowing in the dark Me

      Ugh. I've done it again. I've made the silences all that more awkward and long. I've made you hate me even more. I've made myself the fool once again. Even if I tell you I'm sorry, it's too late to try to heal all the wounds I've created. Who knows, maybe I'm over estimating my influences in your life. Maybe the things I do don't really matter as much as I'm afraid they do. But I still have that feeling... maybe it would be better if I just disappear for a while. Better for the both of us. I wish I were not who I am. I wish I had more control over my life.  I wish you would honestly forgive me.

      "Some things can't be put into words. Emotions. Human Emotions. Feelings of the heart shouldn't be put into a little box. The girl lied to me, and I believed her. The man lied to me, when I trusted him."  Amen.  The thunderstorm. It makes me think of a past telephone call. Before the awkwardness had set it. "I love thunderstorms." "Yeah, me too." Before I made the mistake. Good times are gone. Maybe that's why I have to leave. So that one day, I can come back. And the good times will be waiting for me again. "I love thunderstorms." But that's not the only thing. What the world needs now...

I can't believe I don't know you anymore. I can't believe, after all these years, you still have the power to make me cry.  I don't see how I could forgive you this time... FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO US!!!!

      Dad just got home for the weekend, and already he Kari and mom are having a fight. I think I'm going to leave. You know, take a bike ride or something. I'm acting the same way I would be, dad, if you had been here the whole time. I don't like to see you guys fight.  Bye

      Oh lord how I do love Grounds for Thought. It's such a wonderful little cafe. After lilly and I are done here, we're going to go to the flower shop to pick up a nice arrangment to suprise mom with. I was kinda hoping to meet someone I know here, unfortunately the only people I've seen are Andy Schmidt and Nate Cheedle. If you're reading this now and I spelled your name wrong... hahaha. Like I really care. :-D There's a really cute guy at the register. He's usually here when I come, but I've never actually talked to him... oh wait... that's right. I have a boyfriend.... I guess I'm just still not really used to that... SORRY BEN!  Well... I'm done here. Time to get some flowers! :-D Kristin

      Oh. My. God. That was sooo incredibly much fun. Tracy's surprise birthday party was last night and it was such a blast! OMG, sharron and I had to go pick up balloons from Ben Franklin's before the party started, and we saw tracy at grounds! We were like... OH SHIT! Luckily we saw her before we got the balloons and she didn't see us get them but that was such a friggin close call. I think I stayed up till three but a couple people actually stayed up till six or something. Brian Eberly was there and he was being such a sweety! Nothing like a cute gay guy to really make you feel loved. :-D Tracy was totally surprised too. That was the best part. I think she was about to cry. Only a few people ended up staying the night though, so we all slept in one tent. We played truth or day into the wee hours of the night. I heard some very strange noises while I was asleep... but I'm not really gonna ask. Oh man. So tired. I think I have to go finish packing. Did I happen to mention how tired I am? Still though, totally worth it. And tracy liked the present I gave her. heeheehee. I love my friends. :-D Good night everybody! ~Kristin (I'll be back in a couple weeks! Try not to miss me too much!)

      Oh man. Tonight. It's gonna be so cool. I don't think I've stated this enough. You cannot possible understand how incredibly excited I am right now. It's like... incredi-cited. I love making up new words. I'm ready way too early, but at least I'm ready... oh wait... I'm not packed yet. For anything. Hmmm, I might want to go do that. Oh well, all in good time. I'm so excited. Oh wait... I have to wrap something too. I would tell you, but if this one person found out, I would be shot on sight. Oh well. All in good time, as I said. Man, I'm really repeating myself today. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I only got 5 hours of sleep last night. I might have to pick up a coffee at grounds when I go get balloons. Whoa... who said anything about balloons? I know I didn't...  It's all an illusion, go back to sleep.

      Good day today. Amber took me and Sheena to Oak Openings for a picnic. Fun fun fun. It was such a beautiful day. The boys were all sleeping though, so they missed out. Lazy bums. Heeheehee. Tomorrow night. Oh man. That's all I can say. Tomorrow night. Wow. Then on saturday we're leaving for vermont. I'll be glad to see people before I go. Man. Tomorrow night. Well wait, I guess it is past midnight. Tonight. Oh man. I can't wait. That's all I can say though. Poor amber. Can't come. She's going to college. Ha ha. She'll be back though. Yarr. P-D (that's the pirate smily face) Ok, well I'm tired, and anime is starting again. Can't get enough of that sweet sweet anime. I need a life.  Can I have yours? Or maybe just you.

      So. Here I am. Woo. Downtown was fun today. Man, I didn't realize how much I missed my friends until I saw cassie today. Good times. Getting ready for The Night. Man, that's gonna be some major kick ass-ness. That's all I can say. Honestly, it's only because that's all I know.  Leaving for vermont saturday. The angels are singing. Thank the dear God above. Vermont. Oasis is good. I still want to cry though. "I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now. And all the roads we have to walk are winding. And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I would like to say to you but I don't know how. Cause maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me. And after all, you're my wonderwall."  Such a good song. Sad though. At least, in my current frame of mind. I am irritable. So tired. Headache.  Lonely. I know I didn't really have anyone to begin with... but still... Maybe a short bikeride will help. Yes. That would be nice.

      So. Here I am. Woo. This is the earliest I've been up in weeks. That's sad. I hate sleeping in. It feels good, but it's just a waste of time. I had a weird dream about school last night. A little too weird for my taste.  I get to spend some quality shopping time with cassie today. That'll be fun. Getting drunk on Chai Laittes and buying random crap. Man, that's my kinda good day. To insure a good day, I'm wearing my fun pink skirt and matching braclet. And of course my kick ass drama shirt I got from states. Ah states. That was fun. Pink pony tails top off my outrageous outfit. Man. I'm sooo ready for that Chai. *snore* Oasis is good to listen to if you're not happy. It's loud, so it takes over your mind, but it's not like heavy metal. You can actually listen to it. And I love the lead singers voice.  Time to put on the happy mask to hide the streaks of mascara running down my face. I have made my choice.

      No one can run from the truth forever. No matter how fast you run, it will catch up to you in the end.  You can't blind your eyes from the truth forever. It will find you. Haunt your dreams. No matter how hard you try. It will find you in the end. No matter how hard you try. The truth will find you in the end.  Man, I just realized I'm repeating myself. *sigh* I don't like what I've done. I can't take it back though, for it is what I wanted to happen. I just didn't want to face it. I still wish I hadn't.  I don't know. I feel bad.

      I find it hard to think straight anymore. So many conflicting thoughts race inside my head, it's hard to distinguish one from another. All I can hear is the constant yelling in my head. Yelling for me to make up my mind. Make a choice. Choose the murder weapon, time and date. And the victim. Oh if only it could be me. "The fewer sacrafices the better... right?" Yeah. Kill two birds with one stone. Stop two hearts with one bullet.  I find it hard to think straight anymore. I have no idea why these thoughts are running through my head. I need to make a choice.

      Well, so much for the ingeneous plan. Man, no one told me how expencive duck tape can be. Oh well, it's not like I actually have school spirit anyway. I stayed up too late reading last night, but I can't get back to sleep. The Pillows rock my world. Check them out, just don't try to listen to closly to what they're saying. You won't understand it, it's japanese. Still really good though. I'm too tired to type anymore, so I'm going to leave. ~Gone~

      I decided to walk home tonight after band camp. It was pleasant, it really was. I think that's just how I'll walk home from now on, it's a nice way to cool off.  I had a really shitty day today. We were supposed to have a showing today so we cleaned the entire house. It took at least three hours. Then after we left, the realitor called to say it was cancelled. They called one minute after it was scheduled to start. We were a little mad, to say the least. I had to take the garbage out at one point, and I ended up getting stung between the toes by a yellow jacket. I had a dream last night that we sold the house, and this morning I thought it was real. Then band camp. That in itself is self explainable. Still though, the walk home was nice. A little lonely though.  I wish I had my Blanket. ~Kristin

      You tell me that you suffer when I'm gone. You miss me so much you don't know what to do with yourself. You beg me to never leave again, but I know what's really wrong. The reason you suffer is because when I am gone, there is still hope of my return. So you're forced to wait. The wait for my return is what drives you so crazy, which is why I tell you before I leave this one last time I'm not coming back. It's better this way. Easier on both of us. I'm sorry for troubling you for so long.   Goodbye.

      Here's a thought for every man Who tries to understand what is in his hands He walks along the open road of Love & Life surviving if he can   Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say Chained to all the places that he never wished to say Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say and as faced the sun he cast no shadow   As they took his soul they stole his pride  I love that song. For anyone who is not familliar with Oasis, I strongly recommend you become familliar with it. And then there's the pillows. Man, gotta love them pillows. You can't really understand what they're singing unless you can speak japanese, but even if you can't understand then they're still worth listening to. You would have already heard some of their songs if you ever watch FLCL (fooly cooly) on adult swim at 12. Now I'm sleepy. All this talk of pillows and such. And then there's the fact that I woke up really early today to go get my picture taken for school and all that jazz. I still stand by my statement that I made yesterday. I. Hate. Bandcamp.  Although, the rides home can be pretty nice.

      The best compliment I've ever gotten "You're like the desert I never ordered."  Today was the best day ever. I'm so glad I went out. Me and Amber had such a good time together. I'm totally losing my voice though. I don't care, it's all worth it. I love my friends. They're like, the coolest people I know. I know that sounds really corny, but I don't honestly give a damn. Besides, I swallowed too much pool water today, do you honestly expect me to make sense?!  There's only one thing that's bringing me down right now. Some people just can't take a hint. Some people just don't know when to drop something, to let it be, to move on. Oh well, I had too much of a good day to really let it get to me, so for now I'll take it with a good humored shrug and an attempt to aid the situation. Oh well, it's all good.  Good night, sweet prince. May we meet again some day.

      I don't care anymore. Fuck it. Let it all go to waste. All the hours, all the tears. I don't care anymore. I just don't care.

      I should really stop this all. I should take what I can get and be thankful for it. I should stop crying over what I never had. I should stop thinking too much about a situation and just let myself be happy in the moment.  But what moment is there to be happy in?  "You were afraid of being abandoned so you abandoned them. You distanced yourself from the whole thing."  I should really stop this all. I should stop crying before I lose myself again. Because there would be no one to search for me. They've all stopped coming, and I stopped waiting, and it's all ended now.  I'm sorry.

      I rode my bike to the festival this afternoon, in hopes of finding some friends. I did, and I had a pretty decent time for a while, but then I left, and now I'm back here. I'm sorry to Tracy and Joe, who I kinda ran out on. Well, without the kinda. I'm tired. I knew I should have gotten some coffee while I could. Oh well.  It happens.

      I tried to make it a good day. I tried so hard to make it a good day. How could it have turned so wrong?? What could lilly have done to make those bees so angry? Why'd I have to try to wear my stupid skirt on my bike? Why didn't I do my homework when I got home, instead of putting it off till now? Now that I'm sooo tired. Such a long, rotten day. I tried so hard.  "People told me Smile, things could be worse. So I did, and it was."

      I changed my bus for band so that now I'm actually sitting with my friends. I don't know why I picked the bus I did the first time, I had no friends on it. Maybe this will make the friday night football games a little more pallitable.  Heh, what am I talking about? This is band, and band is one thing I just can't stomach.  I've been so tired lately, and school's hardly even started. I have a bunch of homework due tomorrow, but I just can't bring myself to do it right now. Maybe I'll have a little more energy (and patience) after dinner. *yawn*......      *snore*

      Hello. I'm happy. I just watched part of Breakfast at Tiffany's, and watching good old movies always puts me in a good mood. I wish I were audrey hepburn. She's so pretty, and skinny, and talented, and pretty, and smart, and she's such a good actress. Happy happy. (^_^) I like this. I think I'll go for a bike ride and spread the joy. I'm talking to amber though. That makes me happy too. September 19th is national pirate day. Don't forget that! I'm listening to Sixpense None the Richer, which also makes me happy. I like this. I'm happy. I think I'm just repeating myself right now, but I don't really care. I got my hair cut, but you can't tell the difference. I'm trying to grow it out, so this is good. I'm doing good. I like getting hugs, and happy waves, and good scores, and long walks and random talks and good times. I think this could be considered a good time right now. Yes, I like this. This is good.  ~Kristin

      You know, any run of the mill football team can win a game or two, but it take a truely skilled team to lose every single one. And not just that, but to get stomped on by every single team. That, my friend, is why we love our team so much. Our team is our only claim to fame! Who cares about our other sports, or our wonderful arts department, we have the worst football team, and that's all we need.  So go right on losing you crazy bobcats, and we'll be behind you all the way!  even if it's only because we'd like to keep our distance...

      I always wondered What it would be like To know I'm loved To kill someone To feel your hands Fading away To cry crimson tears To walk among the stars To shut out those words Every girl dreams of To leave it all behind And start all over Again.  But now I'm not so sure.

      It's such a beautiful night. I decided to go for a bike ride, and it was so nice. It was cool, something I was glad of. While out, I ran into Kevin, Carmen, Doug, and Mark almost ran into me. Yes Mark, there is a purpose for turn signals...   I'm almost done with my homework, and that makes me glad. Maybe after that I'll try to get furi kuri to work. Or maybe I'll just go to bed. It's all good.

Don't cry, lets say good bye. Adieu. It's time to say good bye. I know that in time, it will just fade away. It's time to say good bye. I stand alone, and watch you fade away like clouds high up and in the sky. I'm stong, and so cold, as I stand alone. Good bye, so long. Adieu."

      I miss talking to him. He told me he loved me, and I believed him. He called me Julia, because of how much he loved me, and I loved him for it. Now the song, the haunting tune, reminds me of his name, of his face, of his lying words.   How I wish I could believe him again.   Goodnight Julia.

      He's told me So many times How he hates Her, her, and her And yet He always greets them With such a smile It makes me wonder If I'm Not one of them Too   Good times last night. As I was laying on the ground next to the bon fire, half asleep, listening to Liz strum her guitar, and catching bits and pieces of conversation going on around me, I was really happy. It was just so nice. I had a good time last night.  Mostly.

      Fun times today. Bobby's jaw dropped when he saw me, and mark told me I was the first thing he'd really seen this morning. I wore the (as nate called them) hooker boots with my short black skirt. I love that outfit, especially with my black trench coat. I was surprised Headley didn't bitch me out for wearing something like that on the field, but I marched just fine SO HA! I am one of Balthazar's musicians. Well, actually I'm the only musician. It has no lines, but I think it's actually going to turn into a pretty important part. Music is needed in this play, and I play it well.  I've been having terrible dreams about bugs lately. The first was that all these ants and mosquitoes had made nests in our house, and that mom and dad wouldn't do anything about them. Yesterdays about about this sweat bee that got inside my thumb and started sucking my blood. I could feel it too, but I couldn't get it out. I could see it, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. *shudder* not a good time to sleep.

      Auditions were today. G said that just because we don't get a callback doesn't mean we don't get a part. I think, just because we get a callback doesn't mean we get a part. I want to get a part. But I don't think I will. It's just one of those gut instincts. Or if I do, it'll be the same kind of part I've gotten this whole time. The kind of parts that can be shoved into a corner and ignored until you realize they have a line that wasn't said. Not that it effected anything. I don't want that.  But I dunno.

      Tea is nice. Except for when it's too hot. Then it's not so great. But when it cools down, then you're in business. My day was alright, although it seemed very long. I didn't end up going to the library again like I had planned, but I think (hope) I'll be ok. I stuck around after school for a while to hang out with tracy and cassie and amanda and kristina and tylor and joe. That was fun. Now I'm drinking tea... or at least, waiting for it to cool down.  Oh, did I just waste your time?  Oops...

      It's raining again. The sun is out, and it's raining again. I can see the drops sparkling between the leaves. As my song comes on, the steady beat of the rain on the skylights back it up, and suddenly, my headache isn't so terrible anymore. Tomorrow doesn't seem as daunting, and english seems a bit more doable. My song ends, and the sound of the rain becomes less and less, but the feeling stays. It's like a nice, soft fuzzy, shading my eyes in a blanket of warm fatique. Yes, this isn't a bad thing.

      I'm lonely. I feel like I'm missing something. Like the only thing that would really make me feel myself right now is a big hug. Someone to talk to. Someone to listen to. Not even someone to understand, just someone who might feign interest for five minutes or so while I say whatever comes to mind or mouth. It seems to me like I have done a lot of talking without thinking lately, and I'm starting to wonder if some people are starting to think I'm an idiot because of it. Oh well, just one more thing people think that I already know.  I'm lonely. I really wish I had someone to talk to right now. Someone to lie to me. To make me believe that things will be ok again. That is, of course, how I know they're lying. Home Coming is coming up soon. I'll probably end up going with friends again. That's how it goes.  I'm lonely. I really wish I had a hug right now.

      So, today has been interesting. I went to go pick up my photos from Amber's graduation party on my bike this afternoon, but had a bit of an accident. Now it looks like someone attacked my leg with a fork. A many pronged fork. I learned something. Never try to go up a solid curb on your bike. Unless your me.  Or an even bigger idiot.

      So last night. Wow. That was the best. That was absolutly the best. I don't think even tonigh, being homecoming, could top it. We get to the football game, and we're looking for amber. And looking. And looking. And finally Mark finds her! Only, she's by the consesion stand and we're in the bleachers... So we had to wait till half time to run down and find her really quick. I ran to the fence by her and was screaming her name until she finally realized it was us. The best kind of hugs are the ones from friends who haven't seen you in a long time. So we hung out at third quarter and that was super fun. Then Anne came and we're all like IT'S ANNE! I didn't actually know she was coming to the game, so it was really cool that we got to see both Amber and Anne. Then, the most amazing thing happened. WE WON! THE FIRST (and probably only) GAME THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY WON! And since it's our homecoming game, it's so appropriate. Springfield must really really suck. So then we finally get back to the band room and I'm trying to change while everyone else is running around the band room with the tubas and the drummers are playing as loud as they could. Man, you don't know fun until you do The Brazillian in boxers on the balcony of the band room. So then we all (me, tracy, cassie, amber, ian, rob, and eventually alex) and we're all like So what are we going to do? So after about ten minutes of just standing around we decide to go to ians house, but amber had to take me home quick so I could change and alex decided to go with us. Then after that we had to go kidnap Mark, and I got to see his re-done bedroom which looks pretty good. Then we went and hung out in Ians garage with Rob and him singing and Alex throwing random objects and cassie and tracy doing what they do and me and amber and mark. Rob and Ian are really good. I don't think I can really stress that enough. They are really really good. After a while Tracy and Cassie had to leave so they left a little before 11, and they stole Mark. So then it was just me amber alex rob and ian hanging out and alex makes a really good pillow (I was tired) but then around 12 he had to go. Then around 12:30 Amber's like "Who's up for some waffles?" and so we go to waffle house. Heeheehee, good stuff. Then, while we were there, Karly and Anne came and we got to talk to them a bit and that was fun. Then we dropped Ian and Rob off and Amber came over so she could see my home coming dress and get her christmas present. I'm glad I got it for her, she really liked it. And then she left, and I woke up with three charley horses and a stiff neck (that's what you get for doing Special K to times in one night) (why is the head banging cadence called Special K?) but it was still soooooooo much fun. I'm glad Amber came back because I love her and I missed her and man I've been typing for a long time. *hand cramp* We'll have fun at home coming, so yay. (too bad Amber can't come to that though) Oh well, can't hog her the whole weekend. LOVE YA HUN! ~Kristin

      Well, lilly and I jut got back from the library. We decided to walk there since we had a showing this evening. There we saw doug and carmen, and chatted for a brief time. Then we walked over to blue ribbon and I turned in my pics from over the summer to get developed. Then we walked back, and dad was home, so that was nice. And then tomorrow Amber and I are going to hang out after the football game which I am rreeaallllyy looking forward to. I haven't seen her since august, and I know it hasn't really been that long, it seems like ages. I got some work done on my tome at the library, which is good because I really need to get it finished... now... I think it might actually be due next week, but at least I finally got my second note card check in today. Yes, for now, all is well in the life of me.

Think to yourself now, what could I have done and what do I do to make up for it?  However, if you happen to be luckey then I'm not mad at you. Even then you're not too luckey as I plan on taking it out on you anyway.   AAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Today was another day. As was yesterday, and as will tomorrow be. That seems to be how this whole life thing works. I got my dress. I will wear it on saturday. I talked to amber. I'll see her on friday. It will be fun. But it will all be another day. For now, I'm still waiting for today to end. But then, at midnight, it will be today again, and it will all start over. Tomorrow never comes because even at midnight, it's always today. Tomorrow may be a better day.  But will I ever reach it?

      Saturday is homecoming, and once again I am left without a date. I'm kinda hoping Amber will take me since she'll be up from college this weekend, but I don't really know if she'll be let in or not. Let's just say I have complete faith in the fact that no one will notice she graduated last year. 8-11, I know where I'll be. Mr. Dever really went out of his way to get the big gym this year... (sarcasm) I dunno. I'm just tired, and I still have so much work to do. I wish I had someone to really talk to...

      God Bless Bebop. So yesterday was fun. I went to ann arbor with Kailey and we went to this anime store and I spent fourty-five dollars on crap! Money well spent, let me tell you. Then Kevin and I went downtown to do some work on halloween costumes but salvation army was already closed so we ended up just wondering around wearing fuzzy angel wings. Then we went back to his place, only to realize the tv was already in use so we just waited till the big one was free to watch kenshin. I went home around one and woke up to go help at church. Tracy called me to tell me she's going to Franklin Park and I'm like NOOO!!! (I can't go) So that makes me sad but I really really have to do homework and there's rumors of grandparents visiting us today.   Lilly's trying to steal my wings... I must flee!

      Oh my god, last night was not fun. I woke up at two am freezing cold. I was so cold I couldn't even get out of bed to get another blanket or something. I couldn't get my teeth to stop chattering, and my body to stop shivering, so I was just laying there half alseep for a half an hour. Then I started having this crazy semi-dreams. I was like, half awake and I started having a dream that the marching band was marching through my room and around my bed and Mr. Headly was yelling at me because I just wanted to sleep. Then around 2 thirty I got this really really bad stomach ache and it still hurts, making it really hard to walk.  So thanks a bunch to all you drama dorks who didn't come to the prop room cleanup at the junior high. It was discusting. This was actually this first time it had ever been really cleaned, and we didn't even get it totally done. Even though we went and bought masks to keep from breathing in the dust and mold, I have a feeling that shortened our lifespan about 93 years. *cough cough* oh god it hurts to cough...  So then I got my homecoming pictures and they turned out ok. The only picture that didn't come out was the one of just me, but it was ok. Now I'm really really tired, and amanda never called me about the anime thing, but oh well. I'm done here. *snore*

      So I finally found out what happened, and it was exactly what I thought. It's strange though, when I heard it, the way it was said made it seem like it wasn't such a big deal. And for a moment, I believed it... then I remembered where I said that, and it made everything worse again. It was as bad as I thought, but worse than I hoped. *sigh* At least I know what to do now.  I got my third and my final notecard checks today. I was so happy, for the rest of class I was doing irish jigs in my head. I swear.  We lost again tonight, 20-0, but it was still a really fun game. I sat inbetween alex and anne and that was fun because I actually had people to talk to. The senior show was so great, I absolutly loved it. I want to know where they got those sumo outfits! (and what happened with conquest?!?!) Then doug gave me a ride home for which I was very greatful because I wasn't wearing shoes. Now I'm sleepy, and I have prop room cleanup in the morning, so I'd better go to bed. Yes. That is how it works... so I'm told...

      Did you know you can buy land on the moon now? One acre for only forty bucks. The funny thing is, Cowboy Bebop last night talked about the meaningless colonization on different planets. I think it's a sign. That we should all become teddy bear bombers... or not.   So today wasn't terrible. I've still been kinda depressed, but it hasn't been on my mind so much, so it wasn't too terrible. Was working with drama till 5, and then lilly and I went downtown. I got my homecoming pics dropped off, so I should have those by tomorrow. Then we went to the library where I got really far with my tome (yay). And then we went to grounds and Joe stalked us there so he sat through dinner with us. I would say he ate dinner with us but he didn't actually eat anything. Then lilly and I went back to the library where we ran into doug who gave us a ride home. (Thank you!!!) And then I realized something very important. If you are a realitor, you should never lock a person's door. Especially if the person has no key... and is an idiot... *cough*   I need to talk to him, but I don't know what to say, and I'm so scared I'll start crying. Or yelling.  And then... what about... so cute and so sad... He really needs someone to love him, but I'm so scared of hurting anyone else... I don't know what to do...

Yes, overall, it did end up being worth it. Even if they only part I really had fun in was the last half hour, that one half hour made it ok. Yes. It was good.

      Another sad day. Better, but still sad. It was the first time I had actually looked at him in days. I don't know why, but he seemed different. Something about his eyes and the shape of his lips that made him look like he had been pouting. It seemed like he was having a bad day, so I refrained from saying what I've been meaning to for the past few days. I didn't get a chance to go to rehersal today because of band (and the fact that my inner clock was off and I thought it was 5 and not 4) but I'll try to make it tomorrow. Now I'm tired, and will sleep.  mmmmmmm..... sleep

      Today was another bad day. There were two good parts. Telling Alex Clifford to shut up (and having mrs. bringman applaud me for it) and seeing the shooting star. It was hardly even six thirty when mom and I looked up into the clear blue sky and we saw it. Just a little streak of blue light flying across the sky into oblivion. So beautiful. It was like some kind of omen, that the rest of my day would be just as beautiful. I learned something important today. Never trust omens.

      Today, October 19, 2003 is my dearest friend Katie's birthday. She is sixteen, meaning that we have now known eachother for half our lives. I would just like to say, thank you dearest darling Katie, for deciding to be my friend for eight long years and counting. And happy happy birthday. (and don't worry, I'll send your present as soon as I can!!!)

      It's a terribly sad thing to realize you can't trust a friend anymore. It's a terribly sad thing to realize they're not your friend anymore. It's a terribly sad thing, when you think about all you told them. But maybe it's for the best. It was bound to happen, we all knew that. I guess I just never saw it ending this way.

      Last night was fun. After school till about 5 I hung out with Matthew, Andrew (that's their names... right?) Kevin and Alex. Then I went and passed out candy till about 7:00. Then it started to rain. Hard. Oh well. Around 7:20 I decided to walk over to mark's since he said loreli and him were going to be hanging out and I should stop by if I could. So, taking my umbrella, I walked the five or six blocks it takes to get to his house. No one was home. Oh well. So I walked back, cleaned up, and went back to Kevin, where the boys were minus alex. We went and got some movies with Carmen and Doug, and went back to watch charlie's angels 2. (I still say we should have gotten hellsing, but oh well) Around the end alex came back and matthew and andrew had left. Then we watched sleepy hollow which was really good. Johnny Depp. Enough said. Then we just hung out with the strobe light on till 3, when I went home. Alex is very comfortable. Even if he is a dork. And Kevin has very good aim. Especially if he's trying to get you in the forehead with a hard candy. (teeheehee) And then there's johnny depp.   Enough said.

      so elliott smith is dead. that is very very sad. he had such a beautiful voice. but, there's nothing I can do about it. still sad though.  But I'm not. Just think, if I had chosen a different seat on the bus last night, today might have just been another day. A day just like yesterday, or the day before. Oh God, yesterday, I almost completely forgot. I broke down infront of the central administration building, after falling down the basement steps and realizing I didn't have rehersal. And that face. The expression on his face, or maybe the complete lack of expression, as he handed me back my things. It scared me so bad. I was there for an hour, until alex came out and sat with me, and my parents finally came and picked me up. I cried again when I told mom what happened. I almost cried again when I got to band and saw him, pretending he didn't see me. But as those buses pulled to a stop at the game, I saw him on the bus next to mine. And I know he saw me, because I think he smiled. Just a little. One of those small, uncomfortable smiles you give people when you think they're mad at you. But he still saw me. Then, as we got back in the buses to leave again, I saw sharon in the seat behind him, and we started up a conversation. She and Dylan asked me if I loved them, and I said yes. Then sharon asked me if I loved him, and I drew little periods in a row on my window and looked away. But when I looked again, he was looking right at me. He pointed at himself, and then rubbed his chest. He later told me that that meant "I apologize"  I cried a different kind of tear that night. I never realized how soft his sweatshirt is, as I gave him a hug and told him how scared I had been that I had really lost him, and he told me he was sorry. I didn't have to say anything. He told me he had been stubborn, and he didn't have the right to do what he did. My face burried in his shoulder, my arms around him, with his around me. And he told me he was sorry. And I am one million times better.  Good rides home are the best.

      Yesterday sucked. Stupid band. I hate it. With the burning passion of one thousand suns.  That and my cold. Goddamn cold.  Today was better though. Spent the early afternoon with mom, clothes shopping. Spent the rest of the day with alex. In the end of the day, Kevin came over and me him and alex watched the rest of finding nemo. We got a big box this week. It turns out there was a tv in it. Now we have a big tv. "The Amazing Sounds Orgy" is a very misleading title, but still a good song. Alex and I were supposed to go see elf, but we got there too late, so we ended up just hanging out at the mall for three hours. It was fun. I got the second FLCL manga and some earrings. I also got alex some shoe laces since he was keeping his shoe tied with duck tape. Overall, it was a good day. I just wish I weren't so sick. Me: that's why the world loves you alex Alex: But the world doesnt love me Me: says who? Alex: The world Me: it's wrong Alex: Really? Me: yes Alex: How do you know this? Me: I am the world Alex: What a wonderful world  One of the only quotes of the day that I will ever do: Most people would rather be certain they're miserable, than risk being happy

Except for friday. That's going to suck. Stupid band. Oh well. For now, I'm still in a pretty good mood. Rehersal isn't bad, and the two hour delay was fun. "It's such a beautiful day" Yummeow.  I don't know.  "you know, when I'm with you and we're not being interrupted by anyone, It's like being completely at peace with everything"

      To everyone who helped out with the Halloween dance last night: Thank you so much for making it such a huge success!  To everyone who came: Thanks so much for coming, and I'm glad you had such a great time!  To everyone who missed it: HAHA SUCKA!!!!  It was so great. Ten million times better than homecoming. I had so much fun. Moshing to Rob's band, and sneaking away when we saw Mr. Dever coming our way.  Rob (into the mic): Ask me if I want some waffles Alex (into the mic): Do you want some waffles? Rob: (still into the mic): If by waffles you mean an all night orgy, I'm up for waffles all night long! Mark's absolutly insane cat costume, and Amber as Evil Cher. And dancing with alex. (it's funny how the dj's son can play as many slow songs as he wants to) And then (heeheehee) going to waffle house and squeezing six people into one booth and five other people pulling up chairs, and me drowning in three cups of quickly emptied coffee, with a very warm arm over my shoulder. Yes, when is the next drama dance? We could all go for a little more waffles. :-D

      I hate it. I officially hate it. It's like they've taken everything that was mine away from me. It's not working out. It just isn't. Between the homework, and the hacking coughs, nothing can go right. Nothing damnit. Nothing. I think I'm gonna go cry now. Damnit. I just feel so helpless. The situation looks so hopeless. I feel like I've tried so hard, only to be told that it has to be changed. Everything. And nothing. Everying is changing. Nothing is as I thought it would be. I feel really frustrated, but I have no way to express it. I don't know what to do. I'm just so mad.  damnit  How I wish, how I wish you were here.  We're just two lost souls  Swimming in a fish bowl,  Year after year,  Running over the same old ground.  What have we found?  The same old fears.  Wish you were here.

      ok ok. the weekend is over. So is monday... strangly enough. It was a long weekend, but it was well worth it. The play went well, overall, even though the crowd was very unresponsive today. All is going relativly well, it seems. I think my cough is getting a little worse today, which worries me a bit as I have to go back to the doctor tomorrow and I really want it to seem like I'm getting better. Not worse. Much better. Think of what a day it would be if...  Never mind. Don't worry about it. I am well.  So, so you think you can tell heaven from hell blue skies from gray   how I wish... how I wish you were here

      So I woke up this morning. Then I went back to bed. Then I woke up again. By then, it was about 11. Yes, I did have school today. No, I did not go. SO THERE! Besides, I needed a break. And, I was feeling like... well, I think that goes without saying. So what's to do with a few spare hours? The three Rs. Read, Ramen, and Rebma (amber spelled backwards) Darling Amber came to visit today around 1 with super fun birthday presents. Then around 2:30 I went to school to work on art, but got very very very little done. Now I'm back to where I started, just not feeling quite so.... bad. I might go see Pirates tonight. I'm not so sure anymore though. Oh well. Good night, dear void.

      i don't feel like typing with caps today. so sue me. so yesterday I go to answer the door and ian's standing there. i dunno. it was very strange. then it turned out he had been hanging with kevin and alex and carolyn, so it made a little more sense. bucks lost. oh well. jay.... soemthing... came over at some point and carolyn had to leave ( :-( ) and then we decided to go downtown to "rescue" rob. that didn't really end up working, as he wasn't in any sort of danger. then we went over to alex's house and watched dogma in his basement. good times. i finally got a tour of his house.... oh man.... it was nuts, but in a good way.  then we went to al mar lanes to see amber (yay!!!) and it was fun except that i stink at bowling but oh well. then we went over to waffle house and i felt bad because i had no money so amber paid for me but she also paid for two other people so yeah.... (sorry!) we got back pretty early actually it was only midnight when we finally got home but even after the two cups of coffee i was ready for bed. i accidently slept till 12:30 which is something i never do and now feel bad about just because it feels like a giant waste of day. alex called and wondered if i wanted to go to franklin park mall but i said no... even though i should have gone... but right now i'm not feeling that good so it was probably a good idea to stay home. i'm seriously rambling now. mrs. dunn would be horrified. oh well. this is my first real update in ages.   hahahahahahaha.   sucker

      Allright allright I admit it, I've been slacking off with the blog. It's only because I love you, though, and want to protect you from the truth! erm... something like that.  So I'm sick, and it's not fun. The penta trip is tomorrow, and so is my doctor's appointment... funny how I'm supposed to be at two places at once...  Oh well. I'm hope I'm better by friday. Friday night I'm supposed to go hang out with alex, and then saturday I'm gonna try to see the last samouri with kevin. Then... sunday.... something? I don't remember. School's going well. We switched art classes, so now I'm in drawing, but Mrs. Meyer's wanted to put one of my projects in the art show so that's cool. Mr. Glandorf is giving me all these stupid rules for my experiment making it so that if I follow them, I won't actually have any real results... I wonder how he'll feel when he realizes I have to break them or else I'll have no research paper... There's no way I'm going to change it this late, so oh well! :-) Vacation wasn't terrible. I got a cold. But I also got to see The Nutcracker, and it was really really cute, so it wasn't totally terrible. I've been whistling Sleigh Ride all day, but that's ok because I really like that song and I'm glad we're playing it in band because isn't it pretty much a tradition for symph to play that in the winter? I think so. Sleepy sleepy.   *yawn*

      I woke up this morning at exactly 8:12. At first I thought I was seeing things again, sometimes when I'm tired I can't think straight, but no, it was right. I was over 20 minutes late to school. It wasn't till 2:30 that I actually went. Mom told me that it's not good for a person with a 100 degree temperature to go to school. I suppose. Today's been so strange though, it like I've been walking around in a daze. I knew I was walking down that hall, but I couldn't feel it. I knew I was moving, but I couldn't remember why. It was like everything was fake, the only thing that was real was the terrible heat radiating from my bones that surrounded my body and stuck to every inch of my skin. The unbearable feeling of such heat, more fever induced fun. Today I missed at least two tests, (geometry, french, and possibly world history), getting back my paper from Mrs. Dunn, and Alex. But then about two hours ago, my doorbell rang, and there was a very silly boy there waiting to give me a hug. Thank you alex.   heeheehee, dork

      I first realized I shouldn't go to school this morning when I walked outside and lost my vision, and the majority of my balance. The only thing I could see was a bunch of strange neon green lines and a lot of black. Mom helped me back inside where she made me sit down. When she did that, I managed to get my vision back, but there was a strange rushing noise in my ears. Mom said that that means I had almost fainted. That's happened at least three more times today. Then she took my temperature. 101.0 degrees. That was actually kind of funny. How can a person have that kind of temperature, and yet not be able to stop shivering? I laid down on the couch for a while, but I was very cold and didn't get any kind of restful sleep. I had some breakfast and a lot of pills and more attempted sleep. Around 2:30 alex called me to see if I was ok and that made me happy. For a while now I've been able to walk around without too much trouble, but then again, I really have taken a lot of medication in the last 11 hours, so I'd better not push my luck. I missed school. I really wish I hadn't had to take a day off. I hate missing work. *gags* Alright, well I'm starting to feel rreeaallllyy hot (at least I'm not shivering anymore) so I'm gonna go lay down or something. ttfn ta ta for now

Oh weekend, why will you not come sooner? Oh crap... I forgot... shoot shoot shoot. I have to be better by saturday! Noooooo!!!!!   craptastic.   when i move my eyes fast i get dizzy....   not good?

      if i knew what to say i would say it a million times, but i don't, so i stay in a suspended silence. i shy away from questioning eyes, blinking away my tears of confusion, frustration, madness. black is what i see. black is what i feel. black is what i am. i don't know what to think, i don't know what to do, i don't know what to say.  so i stay in a suspended silence.

      a most regretable weekend. i am sorry, that i am. sorry for what i've done, and for what i now have to do. so sorry.   And in despair I bow'd my head:  "There is no peace on earth," I said,  "For hate is strong, and mocks the song  Of peace on earth, good will to men."    fortune cookies make sweet liars

      If you still think of me, then you waste your thoughts on a dream...   I just got back from seeing The Last Samouri with Kevin. It was so good, but so incredibly sad. At one point, there was a problem with my contacts, which made it seem like I was crying... (just trust me) The cinemaphotography was beautiful, and the story was really moving. But it really made me think. We are one of the most uncivilized nations. Honor, respect, discipline, and family are sacraficed for technological advances and commercial opportunities. And what of those that we presume to declare to be "uncivilized"? The ones that live simply.... but even as I write this, I force myself to wonder, what is the right way to live? The is no right answer, because all civilizations seem strange in the eye of a foreigner. Things that can seem right to one, can seem so barbaric to another. I don't know. Maybe it's just because I'm too tired. But still, I'm glad I saw that. It reminded me that some of the most beautiful things in life are the most simple, like a cherry blossom in spring, or the way snow floats in winter. True signs of a truly great movie.  Have a good night.

      So today I spent the day, well, two hours of it anyway, ringing bells for Salvation Army with alex. It was pretty fun, we were singing christmas carols and Ian stopped by and acted like a hobo. It was very cold though. Then we went back over to his house and hung out. Right now I'm in the middle of trying to organize us geting together tomorrow to see Lord Of The Rings again. I'm a little worried, as I'm starting to question weither or not it's going to work, but we have time...  I think...  Oh well. It will work. Mom's working on my costume right now, and I'm very grateful for it. My hands are very numb... Good music is nice. I'm thirsty. I'm also talking very randomly, and without much purpose, but oh well. It happens sometimes.  MEOW!

      I just got back from the lord of the rings, and that is all I will tell you about it. Go see it yourself and draw your own conclusions. All I have to say is "oh.my.god."   today I felt like I was in a dream. every time I would see heidi she would tell me how long until the movie started, even if it had only been minutes since I had last seen her. then after the movie, we went outside to wait for her mom, but after a minute decided to brave the cold inside. I was shivering so hard I couldn't find my balance, and had to lean against the wall. it's been hard to think straight.   MEOW!

      I like to act because I get to put on a mask, and escape reality for a bit. Sometimes I like to keep it on even after the play, just to stay in a non real world, even if only for a little while. But then, when I do that, it becomes harder and more painful to take the mask off again. To face the world through my real eyes. Life isn't scripted. You can't just sit down with a bunch of people and decide what you're going to say, and make sure everyone understands your decisions. Things happen that make me realize that more and more, every day. Not everything will happen how you plan.   That is why I like to act.

      Home is behind The world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadow To the edge of night Until the stars are all alight  Mist and shadow Cloud and shape Hope shall fail All shall fade   Oh man, that movie was so good. I'm planning on learning how to play some of the songs on my flute over vacation. Oh yeah man, I'm a real party animal like that. Yesterday I went to see Lord of the Rings for the second time, and it was still really good. We were all dressed up (yes, we are dorks like that) and we saw Mrs. Dunn. The funny thing was, she saw us first. Yeah, that was interesting. (luckey for me I have a good grade in english) We were supposed to do something tonight, but no plans were ever made, so I'm pretty much just sittin around here looking like a bum. Oh well, I have my Billy Boyd.   Home is behind The world ahead...

      YES. I AM supposed to be working on my science paper.... but right now.... my eyes won't focus on the screen. My fingers anre nervously tapping the keyboard and it's turning into words. So I decided to come here. Not that it will do my any good. PROCASTINATION!!! Yes, that moca-latte I had this morning was missing chocolate, but it most certainly wasn't missing it's caffine. Only my body is feeling it though, not my mind. My eyelids are still hung at half mast from staying up till 1:30 reading a new comic I was loaned the other day. Making sure my cell phone was indeed on so I wouldn't miss any calls. Even at that time of night. There was always hope. To no avail. No matter. "so he would sulk and drink and mope and cross his arms and hope to die..." TELL ME WHAT TO DO! I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE! I've lost all the tears I'm going to this weekend. I'm at a loss as to what to do next.  SCIENCE PAPER HO!   caffine rocks my squeeky slippers off......

      So often I'm made to be sorry for something I've done. Why now must I be sorry for something I cannot? Why must I be sorry if someone else chooses to not understand? Does this make me sound insensitive?   but then, i'm alway the first to apologize. i just want people to be happy. is that really such a bad thing? i just want people to be happy. even if it's not always me. even if it's not always right. i want to cry for this, but i know i haven't done anything wrong! I haven't done anything wrong! I Haven't Done Anything Wrong! Why?! Why?!     i'm sorry there's nothing i can say to make this better.   Driftwood: A fairy tale So he would sulk and drink and mope and cross his arms and hope to die. And then a fairy came one night to bring this sorry boy to life. She pulled some strings and spun him about. That boy sprang up and began to shout, "My arms, my legs, my heart, my face they're alive!" And she would cry, "Liar, liar! What have I done? You're no lover, and I'm no fighter."

      "A magician closed you in his hand and opened it, suddenly empty."  ~Yuan Chen  Holy mother of pearl I've been working on my stupid tome for at least four hours now and I'm only halfway finished. I just don't know how to make it go any faster! I don't think there is a way. Mom told me I ought to go take a break, so here I am. Homework is going to consume my entire being this weekend just you watch. I procrastinated, and now I have to pay for it by missing any kind of social event, no matter how much I would rather be there. Maybe tomorrow I'll work on my painting and leave my papers for sunday. I don't know. Something has to be done. Well anyway while I was working on my tome for Spring Moon, I found that quote and was rather taken by it so I thought I'd copy it down. I'm glad I did, but I'm yet to discover why. Just something about it. I don't know. I'm going to go now. Maybe mom will take me on a brief shopping expedition. Maybe.   GAH!

      Once upon a time there was a little girl. She loved to wander the hills and fields beyond her grandmothers house. One day, she saw a mysterious site. It was a tree unlike any other tree. It was a muffin tree. The girl was delighted. She climbed its branches, she ate its muffins, she rested in it's shade. Day after day, she returned to climb and play and eat, by the old muffin tree. The muffin tree was generous in it's bounty, and soon she grew very fat. She could no longer climb the tree's branches. All she could do was sit in the shade and eat more tasty muffins. After many days of this, she became bored. "Oh muffin tree, why do you only grow blueberry muffins? Please make me another kind." The muffin tree said nothing, as it was a tree. And trees don't talk. But, just because tree don't talk doesn't mean they're aren't listening. The next day, a new kind of muffin was growing on the tree. "mm" And it was the best muffin she had ever tasted. However, three minutes later she fell down dead. The end. The moral is, never talk to muffin trees.   www.muffinfilms.com

      Meow.  I'm back, for all of my avid readers, who I'm sure have missed my almost daily updates. Nothing much has been happening here, and that includes with homework... (oh well) I've been hanging out with Alex a lot which has been fun because... well... it's Alex. What else is there to say. Late night phone calls are very fun, I must admit. Today, Lilly asked me who I was going to marry. She's such a cute little five year old. She told me if I married Alex I could stay with him forever. Kids say the funniest things. I don't really have much else to say. School's starting again in 5 days, which is rather depressing. Oh well, it happens. Tomorrow is Kevin's birthday, and the 4th is Alex's. Yay. More shopping. XD  I think I've done enough damage here for one day.

      Today. At first it was only ok. Then it was great. But now it sucks. It's sucked for the past six hours. Then after that, I had so many chances to just go and make it right. Make it better for the both of us. But I didn't. But then, at the same time, I've had even more chances to just go and make it stop. Make it worse for both of us. Bring it all crashing down. But I didn't do that either. I just   I  Just Don't Know What To Do Right Now  so I'm just not going to do anything.

      I am unaware of what to do next. Well, ok, I know I should do my homework next, but that's not what I'm talking about. Something has changed, and I don't know what to do about it. I wish there was a real way to know what to do in these kinds of situations.  "so he would buy her gifts and kiss her hand to show he was for real. And she would take those gifts and kisses though just stringing him along. She knew about, those wooden boys. It's an empty love, to fill the void. Pinoccio, oh boy how your nose has grown, and he would cry out 'liar liar. I'll prove it to you.'"  Black was what I wore today and black is still my mood. I don't know what to think and I don't know what to do. There are no easy answers no no no no no no no easy answers no no not anymore no more easy answers now.

I was considering going to see Peter Pan with cassie and kat today, but I don't think I'll be able to. Then amber was thinking about coming over, but I think even if she does call me about that I would have to decline. I look like crap, and the house is prtty much under contruction at the moment. I think I'm going to go veg infront of the TV while watching the princess bride and pray that the tylenol I just took kicks in soon. (or that someone will take me to grounds for an emergency coffee break) But I guess I can't just mope around here all day.

      Today is almost over. Maybe tomorrow will be better. I just got back from seeing big fish for a second time. It was me, amber, maggie, rob, tracy, kevin, kat, and mark. Half of us cried. It was just so good. Then we went out to waffles. I couldn't eat half of what I ordered because I just felt awful. My stomach hasn't been liking me for the past couple days. (it's not alone) Then mark and I had a very long talk while he was taking me home. It was lovely. It made me remember why I consider him to be such a good friend of mine. Even if his car does smell like nilla wafers. I am very tired now, but seeing as how I had two cups of coffee at waffle house, I don't think I'll sleep. I'll probably just read till 2 then fall asleep with my light still on. It wouldn't be the worst thing that's happened to me today. Will miss amber. She goes back to college on sunday. Maybe will do something tomorrow. Hope tomorrow it good.   doubt it    about two minutes later... this blog says it's 12:32, but it's only 11:32... must figure out how to change that...

      Oh man, I got so much sleep last night. It was a beautiful thing. Then I had a giant cup of coffee to go along with that. By the time I got to school, I was in such a good mood. All of my exams (I think) went pretty well. I hope they did, anyway. Then mom lilly and I went to Ben Franklin's to get balloons and grounds to get coffee. The coffee was delicious. The conversation was a little disturbing though. Anyway, a whole bunch of friends and I are going to see Big Fish tonight and I'm excited because it's a really good movie and I don't get to go out with these people all that often. Oh well, I'm off. Overall, this hasn't been a terribly horrible day. Some parts I could certainly do without, but oh well. It will be over soon.  tata

      off to bed. notice, I said off to bed, not off to sleep. it would be nice if i could sleep, but i'm not going to count on it. more like a mixture of fitful dozing mixed with a lot of crying and tossing and turning. maybe i'll try to read one of those books mom got me. maybe i'll just stare at my blank cell phone for a couple hours in a dim realization that no one is going to call me. or maybe i'll just cry till 5:30, get up, and go on like i have been this past week. fuck no. i'm better than that. aren't i?  i wish.

      Every single thing. Every single fecking thing. Today was complete shat. Except for art and a little english. Art cause I finished my painting/drawing and mrs. sockman said she really liked it. English because Mrs. Dunn asked me if I was ok, and looked like she really meant it. I almost broke down at least three times today. I just want it to be over. And I don't just mean the week. I really want this to end. Why do people make it their business to make me cry?   DAMNIT! this has to stop this has to stop this has to stop this has to stop. on my way out of school, I walked through the halls with my hat over my eyes and my headphones securely in place. It was kind of nice to not have to see or hear anyone, to just walk on in my own little world. Even if it is looking a little bleak.   later: a little bleak? hmm, no. I hate this. I wish I just had a little room where I could go to cry and scream and break as much as I want to. Dog fecking darnit. (that doesn't help, none of the normal satisfation of cussing) IT HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT MAKE IT SSSSSTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've fucked up so much, more than I can stand!  I just want to sit and cry and make IT ALL FUCKING STOP! but no. that's not my choice. that's not my job. it's out of my hands. AND I HATE IT

      I feel cold. I feel so cold, like the unshed tears of a snake after it's struck. I feel so alone. So incredibly alone. After such a brief high, such a brief wonderful high, I sink so low. Lower than when I started. Lower than I've been in a while. You don't understand. You can't possibly understand. But know this. It's got to stop. It has got to stop.   I'm sorry.

      Yay. Ever since saturday evening I have been much better. Even though school starts again tomorrow, I'm kind of looking forward to it. I really want to see what I got on my exams. Alex and I talked saturday night, and the funny thing was, we hardly even talked about what had happened. We talked about completely random things, like nothing had happened at all. And that was that. I hung out with him sunday, monday, and today. Yesterday (being monday) I was at his house till pretty late and ended up falling asleep in his arms... mmm, who needs an electric blanket when you have a boyfriend? (too bad I can't have one to take home with me!) Then today his mom took us shopping at Frankin Park mall and we had a good time there. He found a b e a u t i f u l trench coat. Think Neo. Think the first Matrix. Then you'll have his coat. He even found really cool shades to go with it. It was a wonderful thing. And now here I am. It's a little past four... by four I mean nine of course. I think I'm ready for bed. Good night all you pretty people :-)  ~Kristin

      "I Lied" by me  You ask me if it's worth it And I say yes But I wonder If you agree  You ask me if I love you And I say yes But I wonder What I've done to make you question it  You ask me if it's ok And I say yes Because I want it to be And I want you to be  You ask me if it's true And I say yes Because in the end It's always worth it Because I love you And everything Is going to be  Okay

      Tonight, we mourn the loss of a really cute, short, denim skirt. It died in a tragic accident, and will never be forgotten.  RIP dear skirt.

       urlLink    urlLink audio post  powered by  urlLink audblog   god damnit it cut me off! So yeah, we watched Donnie Darko and it was weird. Not bad, but I just didn't get it. But the song. The song in the end. oh god. it's a very very...   mad world.   I love alex. It's just like, I think about him, and I have to remind myself to breathe. And the funny thing is, I didn't always feel like this, even when we were first going it. It's like, the more I get to know him, the more I want to be with him. I like this feeling. It think it's what people really mean, or try to mean, when they talk about love. I like this feeling. Just a little more proof that it's a....   mad world.

      Starring at the floor on my ceiling Starring at the rugs on my walls Wondering if I'm Really there at all  Seeing you walk through my closet door Seeing things I've never seen before Wondering if  You're really there at all  Seeing the snow fall  off my hair Before it bursts into tiny flames Wondering why I don't feel it Burn at all  And I don't know

We're going out to lunch pretty soon... I hope... Alex is at church not eating for the weekend, but maybe I have get him to come out tomorrow and go see a movie. I'm cold. Where'd All This Snow Come From?!?!?!?!   grrrr

      Two days ago was friday the thirteenth. For being the day notorious for bad luck, it was pretty ok. My bed frame chose a very opportune time to break, but that was about the worst of it. Yesterfay was saturday the fourteenth, also known as valentine's day. It was lovely, it really really was. Mom finished my dress at like, 5:30 but it was so beautiful. I kept getting comments like "you look like a princess!" I loved it. I had dinner at alex's house (heart shaped pizza and a salad which was quite good). It was a really wonderful night, the best valentines day I can remember. Every thing just went right. Everything as so perfect. You have no idea how much it meant to me. It was just so perfect...   Sorry, back to the real world (I got lost there for a sec) So today I went to church and then to southwic to learn that the walden's book store was already closed. Poop, at least I still got miyuki-chan! I had a really good day with alex. We went back to his house after shopping and watch underworld. Well, I watched it, alex fell asleep on my tummy. Teeheehee, he was snoring. But it was a really good movie, and alex was very warm, so it was a rather wonderful experience. Have you ever heard the song "I miss you"? Have you ever heard the song "I miss you" and wanted to cry? Have you ever heard the song "I missed you" and cried so hard that you wished you could run over to their house just to make sure it wasn't a dream?   Sorry. Back to the real world.

      Ok, I feel kinda bad. I feel like I've been acting selfish. Like I've been pouting around just to get attention, while shading my eyes from the real problems of my friends. I feel like even though I did have a really bad day, I probably overreacted. Sorry.

      Have you ever had the feeling that you just want to walk away? Like, just keep walking and not look back. Leave everyone and everything behind, and just start again. I felt like that today, when I was walking home. I didn't really want to go home. I didn't really want to go anywhere. I just didn't want to go back.  Everyone's allowed to have a fucking bad day everyonce in a while, so let me have mine in privacy thank you very much.  Ha, I take that back. It's absolutly no thanks to you.  Whoever you are.

      Yay. This has, over all, been a pretty decent week. Yeah, there were some pretty sucky parts, but those don't need to be mentioned. Friday afternoon I rode my bike over to alex's and stayed there till almost midnight. We went to The Grill around nine for a burgar and they were so good. Then we went to B2K and got some good icecream.  The ride home was really nice. Alex lent me a sweatshirt of his so I wouldn't be cold, and I've slept in it the past two nights. It's very warm, like a big hug. *teeheehee* Oh god I sound stupid. Oh well. Then yesterday we went to see Starsky and Hutch. It was awesome. Seriously, it was sweet. We also went to see the play, and it was actually a lot better than I was expecting. Today I'm probably gonna go over to alex's to watch a movie we bought yesterday that I am anxiously waiting to see. I also got...ummm... wow, totally just lost my train of though. Well, that means I need coffee, also means I'm gonna go drink coffee, also means I'm gonna stop writing now.     I LOVE YOU ALEX!  ~Kristin

      I'll stay up till ten, before I start my homework. I'll stay up till ten, reading a book I stole from Kari. I'll stay up till ten, thinking about the view of my neighborhood from my perch in my tree. I'll stay up till ten, wondering what I ought to do about tomorrow, and the day after. I'll stay up till ten, make some poor excuse for myself, then go to bed without doing my homework. Then, I'll stay up till two, or until I drown in the puddle of tears that will be on my pillow. But I still won't know what to do about tomorrow, or the day after.

      Something I don't understand is why so many people think of the song Greensleeves as a classic love song. It's about a chick who runs off with another guy for petes sake! "Alas my love, you do me wrong to cast me off discurtiously." Does that really sound romantic to anyone?  no. I don't.

      Tonight was interesting. Today wasn't so bad. Cleaned my room, and got my picture taken with the Easter Bunny with Kari and Lilly. I went over to alex's house after that and I gave him his easter present, a movie he's been wanting for a while. He liked it, and that made me happy. Ian and Liz were still there so we hung out and that was fun. I fell asleep around nine and when I woke up tracy had arrived so that was cool. It was... an experience. I wish it could have gone better. Oh, and I'm tired of changing myself, and kissing everybody's ass all the time just to please them, and sometimes getting little or nothing in return. The new philosophy is "If you dont like it, then F U C K Y O U!!!" I think it's a decent way of thinking.  25 hours. That must be a new fucking worlds record for us getting along.

      I fell asleep yesterday at 7:41 pm. In my jeans and t-shirt. And contacts. I had been reading my fourth tome for english, and decided to take a little nap. I woke up this morning at 5:24, very confused as to why I was sleeping in my clothes. Yay for little naps. So today I'm supposed to go shopping with mark. He hasn't called me to tell me when he's going to pick me up. Erm... I dunno. If I'm going to be bitching about that maybe I should go take my shower so I'd actually be ready when he calls.

      I had a really fucking awful weekend. Really. I didn't need to spend 100 dollars to have a shitty weekend. However, I suppose it was a really good eye opener. In that, I realized I only have three friends. AND NONE OF THEM LIVE HERE ANYMORE!!!!!!!! god fucking dammit. People are such fucking hypocrits. "What a piece of work is man" The plays sucked too. Not to mention how many times I got stabbed in the back by some of my best "friends" and how many little cuts I now have on my arms from my fingernails. How the hell can you want something you don't know exists!? Where do out loyalties lie?! I want to scream louder than I can. I want to break and stab and stomp and crush and slash! But I won't. I will remain calm. (on the outside, anyway) I tried to be pretty. I tried to be perfect. I tried to do the right thing. Now I will go cry tonight, and tomorrow reconvince everyone that I am pretty, and perfect by doing the "right thing". I will do what everyone expects me to do, and lose all respect for myself in the process. G told us she's see us all at school tomorrow. I feel like it's more likely that she'll see me in the obituary.    i hate people. i hate them all so much.   yay states.

      I hate watching people in movies kiss. It's like, what's so great about kissing them? Are all people in movies good kissers? I just got done watching The Truth About Charlie, which although is a very very good movie, has some rather sloppy, nose squashing kisses. But the thing is... they really seemed to enjoy it... Is it really not that bad to get your nose squashed in the name of love? I dunno. My day hasn't gotten much better. It's actually gotten a lot worse. But you know what?  Can't complain.

      I don't know what to say. I was trying to think of something poetic to say, but nothing good is coming. So yeah. I don't know. If I could say something poetic, it would be like "I tried to pretend everything was fuzzy peaches, but instead it turned out sour grapes" but that sounds kind of corny. I wrote a peom this afternoon that incorporated that idea, but it's not really good enough to type. So yeah, today wasn't that great. People seemed to be in cahoots to make me cry, and they sure did succeed. (by the end of first period...) It was weird, for a while there I was laughing. Like, after fourth period, I seemed to be ok, but once I left seventh period I sunk back down into myself. Joe was being silly during rehersal, and that helped, but joe's always silly so it wasn't anything special. "nine out of ten times our hearts just get desolved" or something like that. I'm listening to Modest Mouse (their newest cd) so I feel compelled to write down some of the lyrics. But I dunno. I think I'm gonna go do homework. Or go for a walk. Or something. I don't know. If you (the reader) want to do something, or have a suggestion, you probably know either my number or my screen name... cause yeah... I'll be here.   yeah.  If god controls the land and disease And keeps a watchful eye on me And if he is really so damn mild Well my problem is I can't see  well who would want to be, who would want to be such a control freak well who would want to be, who would want to be such a control freak

      I'm very tired. We got a two in band. That has not, however, dampened my spirits. They're nonexistant at the moment, and thus unavailable for dampening. I don't feel like getting into how unhappy I really am, as I don't enjoy blaming my own bitterness on myself... but there's not too many other choices. So instead, I choose to shut up for a long time until maybe I feel better. (I'm going to be shut up for a very long time).  I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

      I've already dumped a boy whom I've told I've loved. I've already tried to kill myself. So if I do it all again, I'd be being unoriginal. But who said there's anything wrong with being unoriginal? Why do I have to be me if I don't want me to be? I could be jade kizuz, famous lesbien writer. Or I could be Elizabeth Robinson, first woman president.  Or I could be dead in twenty minutes. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

      more lyrics for today. this is the moment that you know that you told her that you loved her but you don't. you touch her skin, and then you think that she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me. yeah she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me. i spent a week in silver lake. the california sun cascading down my face. there was a girl with light brown streaks and she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me. yeah she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me. i wanted to believe all the words that i was speaking as we moved together in the dark. all the friends that i was telling and all the playful misspellings and every bite i gave her left a mark. the tiny vessels oozed into her neck to form the bruises that she said she didn't want to fade. but they did and so did i that day. all i see are dark gray clouds in the distance moving closer with every hour, so when you'd ask is something wrong? i'd think, you're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now. no we can't talk about it now. so one last touch, and then we'll go. and we pretend that it was something so much more. but it was vile, and it was cheap. and you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me. yeah you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me.   Tiny Vessels, by Death Cab for Cutie.

      hurray for third post of the day! (even if it's only modest mouse lyrics)  Well all that icing and all that cake,  I can't make it to your wedding, but I'm sure I'll be at your wake.  You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day,  when you get to the point make sure that I'm still awake, OK?   well, ok, not just modest mouse lyrics. It's so wierd, my cell phone tells me it's 8:27, and I'm like nuh-uh honey, it's only half past six! Then I realize, oh yeah, I lost a couple hours at the cla-zel this afternoon. It was fun. Bizzare, but well worth it. If you get a chance, go see Les Triplettes de Belleville (also known as the triplets of belleville). It's bizzare, but well worth it. Just ignore the woman dancing around with no shirt on in the beginning and you'll be alright. Instead, focus on the tap-dancer who gets eaten by his own shoes. Yes, you'll be fine.  yes... i'll be fine...

      Six months ago (last night) amber, mark, tracy, rob, maggie, kevin, alex and I went to waffle house. It was awesome, cause we were all dressed up after the halloween dance. It was an awesome night, but unfortunately, there have been few since then. Amber has gone to college, and only comes home every once in a while. She is one of my very best friends. *gags* Oh god that sounds corny. I feel like I should be wearing pom poms on my head and giggling while I scream BFF AND BUBBLE GUM BUDDIES! YAY! no.  just no.   I loves me some waffles. I misses me some amber.

      Hey. I just got back from waffle house, where I had two cups of coffee, so I decided to come here and write a bit. I mean, I'm not about to sleep or anything. I went to see Troy today with amber, mark, alex, rob, ian, and maggie, and it was pretty fun. I enjoyed it. Especially the naked brad pitt. Oh lord... It was... wow... It's strange, I was really fascinated by  some of the fight scenes. It was strange, when they were fighting it seemed like certain parts were sped up, to emphasize the speed of Akilese (excuse my spelling) and yet at the same time it was slowed to show each stroke of the swords. The choreography was so incredibly intricate, it was beautiful. I know that's kind of morbid, considering how violent it was, but it really was amazing. Then we all went to waffle house (plus tracy), and then I ended up here. I know I'm not playing by the rules, but I find myself not really caring. That's a horrible thing to say, and it's a horrible thing I'm doing... but what if I can't really help it? I didn't choose for those rules to get set down in the first place, can I really be blamed if I don't follow them word for word? ...  Oh well, good night, sweet prince.

      There's nothing I could say To make you try to feel okay And nothing you could do To stop me feeling the way I do And if the chance should happen That I never see you again Just remember that I'll always love you  I'd be a better person  On the other side I'm sure You'd find a way to help yourself And find another door To shrug off a minor incident And make us both feel proud I just wish I could be there to see you through  You always were the one To make us stand out in the crowd Though every once upon a while Your head was in a cloud There's nothing you could never do To ever let me down And remember that I'll always love you    it's called A Minor Incident, and it's by badly drawn boy. it's from the movie About A Boy, and i just felt like it would be nice lyrics to put down in my blog. so i did. so yeah. this week has been very taxing. these last two weeks have been very taxing. both mentally and psyically. probably socially too. i isolate myself. oh well. when people talk about life, they never talking about sleep. they never say how nice it is to lay down after a very long day, and just slip into inconsciousness. it's really really lovely. yeah. it is. my new theory in life.  Sleep Now.

This paper is going to consume my weekend, along with my ten-page study guide for science and the pops concert on sunday. Speaking of which, you should really go to that. It's Sunday night at 7:00 at Kobacher Hall and it's free. As far as I can tell, it's going to be ok, and we're all going to be fancied up so why not come?  done.   only moments (hours) later: I'm done! My 10 page biology study guide is completed!!! And I have an evidence warrant sheet for my stupid english paper! Yay!!!  so... tired... *falls down*

      Guess what folks! Good news! I'm officially losing it! I thought I heard a music box playing the harry potter theme this evening before the play, and for about a week now I keep hearing people say my name. I swear to god someone just leaned over my left shoulder and whispered "kristin". Dark shadows out of the corners of my eyes never cease to entertain, especially when I continuously think someone is walking up the front way to the door! Yay! Fun fun for everyone!  ...  the play is over. isolation insues. call me. for the love of god. call me.

      I love acting. but for all the wrong reasons I loved acting because I get to put on a new face. All the things that we're supposed to say are already written down, and in the end, even though it may not seem like it, things tend to turn out right. All in less than two hours. Even if someone makes a mistake, they still know what they're supposed to say, and things usually don't get too messed up because of it.  my life is not like that.

      Starry, starry night  Paint your palette blue and gray  Look out on a summer's day  With eyes that know the darkness in my soul  Shadows on the hills  Sketch the trees and the daffodils  Catch the breeze and the winter chills  In colors on the snowy linen land    no one is talking to me. the people who think they understand are silent, the people who know they don't understand are worse. people who just don't know talk too much, a mixed blessing. i scorn them for petty problems, but praise them for distracting my from the soap opera that is my life. people tell me to stop using lyrics, to say it my own way, but what if i'm tired of hearing myself talk? anyway, i'm going to go see the third lord of the rings tonight, and i'm going to have a wonderful time, and then i'm going to come home and it will all start over again. i wish something bad had happened in my life, a terrible home growing up, an abusive boyfriend,  something . but no, there is nothing in my life to blame for this depression. there's only one constant, and one thing to blame. Myself.

They say these things are meant for our words only, why would I want to post something that wasn't in my own words or something?  What if I don't have any words to describe what I want to say? God there's so much I want to say, but I just don't know how. Cause I don't know what you want to hear.

      Today was an interesting day. I got a new cd (franz ferdinand, check it) and I made a new friend. His name is Johnny, and he's really cool. He has wild black hair, and big dark eyes. He's tall and skinny, and when he's either in a good mood or really really sadistic (sometimes both) he's really beautiful... There's only two problems I can see that might keep us from getting closer. 1) He's a homicidal manic 2) He's a character in a comic called Johnny the Homicidal Manic.  Oh well, there's nothing about that that I can't get past...   mmmm, johnny...

      i'm so unhappy right now. i had plenty of time to think while i walked away, but my mind remained an uncomfortable blank. i'm just so depressed. there are so many things i want to say but most of them would be out of spite. a truth told out of spite is worse than all the lies you may concoct. or something like that. i wish i wish i wish i wish i wish. it used to be that when i felt like this i would go over to katie's house, but that was a long time ago, and is no longer an option. in more recent times i would go to alex's house but that again is no longer an option. now when i'm in a mood like this, i might go to marks, but he's not home this weekend. or else, i might go to amber, but that would not be appropriate right now as she is currently out with friends. i just don't know what to do. i really really really want a hug BUT I CAN'T FUCKING GET ONE ANYMORE DAMMIT!...  the last several sentences have been deleted due to content. please, have a good night.  *#(%&@%#($&&@$(!(@&#&$^!(*@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Alright, I've decided something. I need my own personal soundtrack. I need someone to follow me around with a sound system and just play songs according to my mood, or what's going on, so instead of me just writing down lyrics, everyone can hear them. For instance, right now "Closing time" my semisonic would be playing. A few minutes ago "And so it goes" would have been playing. However, I can see one drawback to everyone constantly having their own soundtracks running... well two. One, you couldn't lie. The music would give it away. And two, do you know how many people would be constantly running the theme from Shaft? Think about it. It'd be like "wa-ka-ti-ca"  all the time.   Can ya dig it?

      In every heart there is a room A sanctuary safe and strong To heal the wounds from lovers past Until a new one comes along  I spoke to you in cautious tones You answered me with no pretense And still I feel I said too much My silence is my self defense  And every time I've held a rose It seems I only felt the thorns And so it goes, and so it goes And so will you soon I suppose  But if my silence made you leave Then that would be my worst mistake So I will share this room with you And you can have this heart to break  And this is why my eyes are closed It's just as well for all I've seen And so it goes, and so it goes And you're the only one who knows  So I would choose to be with you That's if the choice were mine to make But you can make decisions too And you can have this heart to break  And so it goes, and so it goes And you're the only one who knows    that was the best and worst part of graduation. it was so beautiful when they sang it, but it was the only part where i cried. i don't know why i thought of it just now, but i did, and now it's there. and you're the only one who know. and so it goes.

      i just came in from putting a bottle in the recycling bin. it's drizzling slightly, and the only lights are those from the neighbor's houses. it was so quite that all i could hear was the bearly audible raindrops on the pavement, the distant cars, and the only pair of sandles i could find in the front hall. it was really peaceful, and although it wasn't really cool, it was just on the brink of warm. it was lovely. lonely. but lovely.  i've been really horrible today. i've just been snapping at every chance i had, and isolated. this is what i was talking about earlier. it's not that i can't call people, it's that i make excuses not to. there's one person i want to see right now. but at the same time, i really really don't. god i need to stop doing this to myself. i need sleep now.

      This is a poem I wrote a few weeks ago. I just found it again today, so I figured I would lay it down here. The begining sounds kinda like a part from "A Knight's Tale" but Heath Ledger is hot so it doesn't matter.  I miss you Like the earth misses the sun In the bitter winter Like the flowers miss the rain In the horrid drought Like the fish misses water Suddenly thrown to where It shouldn't be. I miss you Like a poets misses paper Endlessly scribbling on walls Like an actor misses the stage While plays turn into monologues Like a girl who lost a boy Like me Like you Like me Missing you  I miss you.

      I was going to write something silly in here, but half way through I completely forgot the rest of it, so I got rid of the first part too and now all that's left is this. I'm still rather ill today, but feeling much better than yesterday. Now I can actually stand up, and if I'm lucky, eat! Isn't life grand? Katie comes up tomorrow so of course I have to clean but then dad comes home early today and says he feels like poo so what now? I can't have katie over here when people are sick. I would feel awful if I gave her this. There are only a few select people I would ever wish this on! (it's really that bad) So yeah... I dunno...

      So. I'm going on a diet. Seriously, I've found one that I think will really help me to accomplish what I've always wanted. A positive self image. I'm really excited about this. It was actually created by Margaret Cho, and it's called the "fuck it" diet. You see, what you do, is when you're confronted with something with a lot of fat, or a lot of carbs, you have to go deep inside yourself for a moment and think...  Fuck it  And eat it. This should be repeated about six times a day, and goes well with the "fuck that shit" exercise program. I'm sure you can figure that one out for yourself.    ASS MASTER!!!!

      I'm just writing to say I'll try to have a better day  ...  I posted the whole thing in here a while ago. if you want to read the rest, just look in the archives. I don't really have much to say. Katie left this afternoon, but I think last night went ok between her my my friends here. It'll probably be another year or two before I see her again, so it was fun while it lasted. I don't really have much else to say.  echo echo echo echo

      I want to go for a bike ride, would you come with me? Now. The darkness is delicious, and that's why I want to go now. I want to go fine a dark little spot to sit and think. I want to race through the allies decorated with twinkling stars and glide down moonlit paths, or sit in some dark garden and smell the forgotten scents of the day passed. To find someplace to call my own until the dawn comes and the sun reclaims it, that is what I would do.  Would you come with me?    (thank you so much ben for calling me tonight, it was wonderful to hear from you again!)

      I love how mistakes can make the best of evenings. If mark hadn't called and offered to come with me, I wouldn't have gotten downtown in time to see alex. If that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have decided to stay at grounds and gotten to see Kat and Tony. Also, Talea wouldn't have found us and sent us on a quest to find tracy! If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have ended up with a can of chocolate whipped cream at the bowling ally, and then we wouldn't have gone over to Rob's to watch puni puni poemy! I love how mistakes can make the best of evenings!  AFRO BASTARD!

      Gah, I'm so bloody sore! I hardly even realised it till just a few hours ago, but my left leg and my right shoulder and in so much pain! I need like tenmillion asprin and some major comfort foods. And a hug. Or a pillow. Or both! All rolled into one. They should sell pillows with arms for lonely women. I'd buy three. One good thing about sleeping so much today, is that I'm not so tired while watching latenight anime. Just sore. *sigh* Welcome home.   lets do lunch

      Hurray for Amber, Queen of summer! Well, at least she had us all over to her house last night, so I'd say that's worth at least something. Me her and mark went playing tennis at the university, and then we went and played in the fountains to cool off. It felt wonderful, and it wasn't illegal! We even got two other women and a little girl to come and play with us. Then, after that, me mark amanda ian rob tracy cassie kat and heather.... oh yeah, and kevin went to amber's house. I mean, we weren't all there at the same time, but we swam and watched "cannible, the musical" and played lots and lots of spoons. Oh the spoonage that was. *nods knowingly* Amanda and I ended up staying up till five, I think we were the last to fall asleep. And tracy played with her birthday present. *heh-heh-heh* That was so much fun. I slept from five till eleven, then I got home at one and pretty much slept till one-thirty till six-thirty. Lovely lovely one of the best times I've had allllllll summer. (except for katie coming of course) Well I'm still tired so I probably shouldn't be rambling on like this so  WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!  ~Kristin

      So there are these two guys residing my house. One of them happens to be rather cute, tan, and at the moment, shirtless. With a soul patch and dark curly hair, I think he's pretty cute. Just a few minutes ago, he was working infront of the back doors, and you know what? He's wearing spongebob boxers.  Well, now I have to take lilly to her swimming lessons where I get to ogle her cute, tan, shirtless swimming instructor.  Yeah, today's pretty good.

      How is it that no matter what I choose to do it always turns out to be the wrong decision. Tracy told me I was being quiet so she was going to leave me alone, and as I didn't protest (I am being quiet today, I don't know why, I just am) she assumed I'm mad at her or something! I didn't go see that movie with everyone the other day because I was in a horrible mood and knew I would just bring everyone down, so in return for thinking of my friends I get called a bitch! I don't appriciate constantly being wrong! And what about the people who put me in a such a bad mood, shouldn't they get some of the rap? No! Of course not. IT'S ALWAYS MY FAULT!!!   oh please, don't apologize, your words fall on dead ears and your sentiments on a dead heart

      This has been a very long and unbelievably horrible week, but you know what? It's almost over.  Maybe  tomorrow might just get better. I don't know that, but I don't know that it won't. Who knows, maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but when I have so few things to be hopeful in anymore, I'll take what I can get. So good night, sweet prince/ss, may you be in a better mood than my own.

      I was walking through my living room, getting lilly ready for her swim lessons, when I began to feel faint. I could feel the demons hands reaching out from behind me, aiming to snare me by my stomach, returning from this mornings dreams. I clutched my latest book to my chest, but it was too light. I felt like I was going to float off the ground and end up falling again. I laid the book down and grabbed the kitchen counter, waiting for my head to catch up with the rest of my body, while I calmed my breath and my racing pulse. My little necklace jingling all the while. My stomach still aflutter. Today could have gone better.

      I'll sing it one last time for you Then we really have to go You've been the only thing that's right In all I've done  And I can barely look at you But every single time I do I know we'll make it anywhere Away from here  Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear  Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say  To think I might not see those eyes Makes it so hard not to cry And as we say our long goodbye I nearly do   Run, by Snow Patrol  Just one more song I want to send you, but won't.

      Some people say, all you need is love.  I say, all you really need is some rootbeer and vanilla ice cream.  That is, if you want a rootbeer float, and not a meaningful longterm relationship.  But if your local grocer loves you, you could get both!  Just something to think about.

      Tonight was not exactly how I planned to spend it, so many months ago. "she laid her head, on my chest, as the sun burned down the west. There's one thing we still got. One last dance in this parking lot. Oh yeah I, I got a heart of darkness." Heart Of Darkness by Sparklehorse has been on my mind lately. It's funny how some princes ride up on while stallions, while some stand in a Big Boys parking lot while you drive away. I don't know. I'm rambling on now. Mom told me to go to bed, but I just don't think it will do me any good. I don't want to go back to sleep. I feel backwards. I feel like any time I try to do something right, it always ends up for the worse. I always end up making someone mad without even realizing it until it's too late. I'm sorry tracy. I'm sorry alex. I'm sorry mark and amanda and kevin and ben and amber and matt and rob and ian.   fireworks are so beautiful. even though their beauty is short lived, they always go out with a bang.

      Usually, when I have a dream, it will stay with me for a few minutes after I wake up, but then fade slowly as I become concious. For a little more than a week though, I've been having really vivid dreams, a few of them have stuck with me even till now. The strangest part is, in certain dreams I actually  feel . A kiss in one dream leaves my lips tingling, a hug in another leaves me feeling warm and whole. I have felt the smooth of a cloth, and the weighlessness of bouncing in a moon room, and tasted the sweet tang of lemonade. Mom says it's because this summer has been so boring for me that my mind is making up for it in my dreams, but I wish they wouldn't. One of the worst feelings in the world is for everything in your life to go right, only to wake up into reality. For the one thing you want the most to come back to you, only to wake up lost again. After one dream, even after I woke up, I felt whole. I felt warmth. I reveled in the feeling while I wrapped myself in my comforter. It was the best I had felt all summer. But it faded. The feeling faded, but not the dream. I don't know.  Sweet dreams.

      Today sucked. Except for the end. And for the ending, I can say, Today was perfect. There must have been as many fireflies as there were stars, and a warm breeze blew puffs of clouds across the deep blue sky. The only fault I can find is that it had to end, and now I'm here blogging with a dreamy expression on my face and my eyes half closed, trying to capture the smell and the taste in my mind as well as the sounds and the wonderful sight. And the feel. The texture and the warmth. *sigh* There is no word in any language that I yet know that seems right enough to describe this. I think "euphoria" is about as close as I'm going to get. or...   Delicious.

      Well, here I am. 4:44 in the morning. It's kinda funny, because I actually woke up exactly two hours ago. So yeah, since then I've written in my personal journal, and listened to my entire Snow Patrol cd (totally worth it, check it out) but after that I got bored so I came downstairs... and here I am now. Lupin the Third is on, and it's fun. So I thought I'd do a real update for once, instead of just a "poem" or being vague. This has been, and I'm almost positive on this one, the best week so far this summer. I've just been so happy, it really feels good. It's kinda funny, I got so little sleep last night, but I feel more awake now then I usually do at 3 pm after a night of peaceful slumber. I'll probably be dead by 3 today, but there's always coffee. I FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY! Sorry. Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum it's a good day. Today will be good and tomorrow will be good and friday will be too and saturday is just going to rock because it's both Tracy's and Ian's birthday! Hoorah!! Ok, that's enough senseless, sleep-deprived ramblings on for now. But I'll be back!   BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

      It seems like every time I start feeling good, and I mean really really good, I get bogged down by problems. God tonight felt so good. But no, I guess that's kind of over. I mean, it's partially my fault. I mean... I don't know. I don't know what I mean anymore. I'm so tired. I'm so confused. It's like there's so much I want to do there's never anything I can actually do. No one ever tells me anything. I have a song stuck in my head, and I don't know what it is!!! I'm losing my fecking mind!    god, I don't know. the better I feel, the harder I fall, ya know? but seriously, do I have to fall so soon after I feel so good? it makes me just feel worse, you know? like it wasn't real to begin with. why do i feel so cheap?   tell me, did i make a mistake tonight?

I leave friday, and I won't be back for two whole weeks! *falls on knees and thanks god* I sorly need this vacation, as much as I'll miss people in town, I just need to get away for a bit. I just need to be able to think straight again.    God damn...

So yeah, I was totally all confused yesterday, but this morning when I woke up it was just like "why?". I couldn't understand why it seemed like I had so many options to choose from yesterday, when I had made up my mind over a week ago! My mind is made for the moment, and I'm not going back on the decision. That wouldn't be fair to anyone. I'm not going to let this get me down, so hey, be happy, right?    Right!

      Hello dearest faithful readers, how are we all today? Good? Good. I'm sooo tired. Yesterday was fun. It was tracy and ian's birthday, so we went to the quarry to celebrate. After that we went to matt and dan's and hung out there for a while. I felt kinda bad for dan, just because he was just kinda hangin out when we all came over and crashed, and I think by the end he was really getting pissed off. And as&nbsp; weird as this may sound, I also felt kinda bad for maggie. Yeah, she was listening in and yeah she has done things just to get attention from us, but still. If she's going through all this trouble, doesn't that mean that she's been hurt pretty bad? I also think that a lot of things that's been done to her have been unprovoked, and purly to get a reaction. Yes, she's been really really annoying at times, but then, a lot of us are being worse right now. Oh well, after a while Steven and George came and that was totally awesome. We were driving around with the spice girls blasting and it was just really fun. I didn't end up going to big boy's though, even though amber was there. I was just starting to feel kind of uncomfortable with the whole... situation... so I figured it was best that I made my exit. Oh well. Now I'm sleepy, so I think I'll go take a nap. Have a good day/night/evening/afternoon/whatever.

      Hurray for yesterday. It was a lot of fun! In the morning I got to go help mom with the medieval fair (cassie you dirty liar you never came!) and all the kids thought I was sooo pretty in my dress. Then after that I got to go visit steven at boyscout camp, and I've come to a conclusion. I wanna be a boy scout!!!!! Camp Pioneer is soooooo beautiful, it's not fair! And they have all kinds of fun things to do, it puts camp Libby to shame. TO SHAME!!! His mom, meara and I had to leave early though because meara was running a temperature. I was really sad that I had to leave, but I really really hope meara's better. But yeah, it was fun to see him again since I'm leaving tomorrow and won't see him (or anyone else for that matter) for like two weeks! Oh well, vermont, she calls to me. *says in cheesy french accent* As for now, however, I am very tired, and looking forward (ha) to a full day of packing. But at least I'm in a good mood. Yes, I feel good today.    ~Kristin    (Later)  Or at least, I  did .

      Hurray for internet connection being back up!! I had more bizzare dreams last night. I can hardly remember the details, but they were very real. There was one part where I actually had to wake up to realize that I was dreaming. It was weird. Aunt Peggy and leanne left yesterday, but it was really fun to see them. Ummm... something else to say. *think think think* Nothing's coming. Oh! Tomorrow, at the pemberville library, there is a medieval fair and I get to help out! If you want to see me in "authentic" medieval garb them give me a call or come by and see it. It's going to be fun. I think I'm about done here. I need coffee.    SO I FLEE

      Wow, this is definetly my millionth attempt at trying to blog this morning. My dsl connection is totally busted, making it really hard to do anything online. Oh be still my aching heart, and the lack of internet. It's been interesting. I couldn't really tell you what  it  is as I'm not quite sure what  it  is myself, but let me tell you, it's been interesting. I think I mean life. I don't know. I just feel like there ought to be something I'm doing right now, some emotion I'm supposed to feel, but I really don't know what that would be. I think I need to go shopping. That always makes me feel better.... god that makes me sound like such a ditz. Oh well. I feel bizzare. Lacking. Like I missed a step somewhere, or never quite got a certain set of intructions. I'm totally repeating myself, but I'm not actually saying anything that really makes sense.    My aunt and cousin from new york are here. They're fun. I want to go to bourne identity, it looks good. It's 11 o'clock, and the men who are supposed to be working on the porch aren't here yet. I have a cd here that isn't mine  That's the news, you stay classy BG.

      Hey all, and greetings from vermont! My uncle brought his laptop along, and since they're  leaving tomorrow, I figured I might as well use it for a bit. Please excuse my typing, it's a weird little keyboard. I am well here, and the weather has been mostly beautiful. It's been in the lower 70s and upper 60s today and yesterday so we haven't been able to swim, but it's still been nice. I'll be back in one week (the 14th) but until then, like I may have said, anyone can feel free to call me on my cell! I've read more this week than I have for the entire summer, and I'm tan and happy. This morning, I woke up to the smell of maple syrup, and we ended up having pancakes and sausages. Oh man, it was sooooo good. I don't really have much else to say. Kari, if you're reading this, we all miss you and wish you were here with us (but hope you are doing well on your own) As for the rest of you, I miss you myself, and I hope ya'll are well...as well... So yeah, I guess I'm done here. Good night, good knight.
