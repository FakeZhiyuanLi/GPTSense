						   I got my hair trimmed yesterday (so exciting, I know), so now it looks all punk-ish again.  It’s pretty much a reverse mullet- long in the front, short in the back.  I was kinda sad that I couldn’t have Dara, the girl who first cut my hair, do it.  I think she’s a massively cool person... but she’s pregnant now!  She’s one of the few people who I’ve given the right to procreate to, so it’s all okay. *winks*  Sam, Steph, and my ‘club’ got together today... we sit around and play scary video games and scream.  We’ve all gotten pretty good at screaming and now we’re all jumpy.  We’ve also deciphered the meaning of life: WHEN THE MONSTER IS CHASING YOU, RUN FASTER!!!  Gods, I need a life...  Uhh... yeah,  think that’s all...

						   Gods, I hate being sick!  From Sunday the 25th to today-ish I’ve been down with the stomach flu.  I was at school yesterday and today I’m nearly up to par today... but I HATE BEING SICK!  Especially since I wanted to clean my room Sunday to puppy-proof it... as you can see, I’m a major neat freak.  Yesterday was Arena Scheduling... that wonderful time of year that we “get” to “choose the classes we want for next year”.  Yeah right!  It’s a #$%@!$& rat-race!  I don’t think anyone actually got what they wanted... but next year won’t be that bad.  I got my Psyche class, and I’m looking forward to the Advanced Psyche class the semester after.  Oh, well...  However, I’m looking forward to Steph (whom I call occasionally Ryoz, FYI) sleeping over on the 7th of May and then getting J’kar with her that next morning.  I’m living for that, and also for going to New York state in June!!  I’ll get to lean how to fix motorcycles from two of my mom’s old friends, Carl and Hank.  My bet is these entries will be  far  more interesting then!  I love bikes, and I  love NY...    That’s it for now... I guess...

						   After a little convincing from a friend, (yes, I  mean you Ryoz), I agreed to keep one of these public online diaries.  Isn't that an oxymoron?  Aren't diaries supposed to be private?  Oh, well.  Irony is always fun.  It makes me laugh.  For those of you who actually do not know me, but feel compelled to read this for some unknown reason, here's a little about myself:  I'm a 5'3" blonde Goth-at-Heart.  For now, I'm an ex-writer, but hopefully that'll change.  My IQ is about 140, and yes, I flaunt that.  I have to deal with too many fundamentalist bleach-blonde Valley Girls with flowers for brains not to.  Anyways.  I've got six babies: Celeritatis (Tatis for short), a Bearded Dragon, Caleb, a "ghost" Corn Snake, Hannibal, a California King Snake, Fae, a snow albino Corn Snake, Luna, a bronze Corn Snake, and Robin, my foster striped California King Snake.  As you can tell, I love reptiles, mainly snakes.  Okay, this entry is going to stop sounding like a personal ad  now .  Moving on to more important things…  Well, Friday, April 16, I had off from school, so my mother and I went up to a kennel and got a red Doberman Pinscher puppy.  He’s only four weeks old, so we couldn’t take him home, but we’re going to pick him up on May 8, at 10 am.  We’re pretty sure on a name: J’kar, inspired by Babylon 5’s G’kar.  For future reference: J’kar was the largest in the litter, 5 lbs at four weeks, and was born on March 16, 2004.  I’m sure you’re all bored to death- mostly because I am now- so I shall conclude this entry.  Hopefully my next entry will be more entertaining…

						   Thank the Fates... school's out!  Now I can focus on things that ACTUALLY matter to me!  You know what I just realized?  I haven’t gotten really mad in a long time.  I’ve gotten angry, but I haven’t gotten  mad .  There is a difference, you know.  Angry is controlled; mad is fuming, raging, ravaging... and mad feels so good.  I need to get mad, and I need to get mad at someone... and I know exactly who.  And I’m getting mad...  For so long I’ve blamed myself, blamed myself for not being good enough, for not trying hard enough with Jeff and my relationship.  You know what I say to that?  Fuck that shit.  He was trying to tame me, make me more docile... and he nearly got away with it.  It was so subtle, so quiet, so sensual.  But you see, he was fucking with a dragon, and now it’s time to be burned.  I showed my teeth, I warned him.  Don’t try to tame a dragon unless you know you can, and a weakling like him could have never done it.  Even if he was given an eternity.  “Die, die, die my darling! Don't utter a single word. Die, die, die my darling! Shut your pretty eyes. I'll be seeing you again, I'll be seeing you... In Hell!”  I’m so mad right now, I could rip out his throat.  Quiet before the storm’s gone now, and I’ll be fuming for quite a while.  Damn, it sucks I can’t really do anything, since  I’ll never see him again.  But I swear to you- hear that, you prick?- that I’ll find a way.  I’ve got plenty of time on my hands.  Plenty of time.  It won’t be too hard once I come up with something, ‘cuz I’m not half as spineless as that worm.  Angry fades, mad stays until the fuel that feeds it is exhausted.  And trust me, Jeff, I’ve got plenty of fuel.  You won’t get out of this unscathed, even if it takes all my life.  And trust me in this, too: I know what can destroy you.  It’s not the flesh, and your emotions are too numbed because you so high on goddamned meds, but that still leaves my favorite playing field: the mind.  You thought I enjoyed only a friendly mind-fuck?  Trust me, my talents run darker than something so innocent than sheer annoyance.    It feels so good to be mad.  Cleansing... a cleansing fire...

						   Cold Lyrics by Crossfade   Looking back at me,  I see that I never really got it right;  I never stopped to think of you... I'm always wrapped up in things I can not win.  You are the antidote that gets me by;  Something strong, like a drug that gets me high.  What I really meant to say,  Is I’m sorry for the way I am! I never meant to be so cold... Never meant to be so cold...  What I really meant to say,  Is I’m sorry for the way I am! I never meant to be so cold... Never meant to be so...  Cold to you. I’m sorry about all the lies;  Maybe in a different light,  You could see me stand on my own again,  ’Cause now I can see me.  You are the antidote that got me by;  Something strong, like a drug that got me high.  What I really meant to say,  Is I’m sorry for the way I am! I never meant to be so cold... Never meant to be so cold...  What I really meant to say,  Is I’m sorry for the way I am! I never meant to be so cold... Never meant to be so cold...  I never meant to be so cold!  I never really wanted you to see The screwed up side of me that I keep Locked inside of me so deep. It always seems to get to me... I never really wanted you to go;  So many things you should have known... I guess for me there's just no hope.... I never meant to be so cold...  What I really meant to say,  Is I’m sorry for the way I am! I never meant to be so cold... Never meant to be so cold...  What I really meant to say,  Is I’m sorry for the way I am! I never meant to be so cold... Never meant to be so cold...

						   Throughout my life, I have always known I was good at two things, and two things only: building mental walls and making masks.  That is, I’m good at hiding... I’ve done it for so long, it’s all I know how to do anymore.  Hide yourself from others, lock them out with cold stone walls that no one could ever possibly break down...  ... walls that even Spartacus would fear if he saw them and turn away...  ... and then hide behind masks of emotions.  A mask for every emotion, so I could appear human, appear real, appear plausible.  Now, when I look in the mirror, I don’t understand how people can say the eyes are the windows to the soul.  Mine aren’t; they’re too clouded, now too inhuman to be beautiful, if they ever once were.  And my walls are so cold, any touch hurts because it is so warm in comparison... it’s kind of like running frost-bitten fingers under lukewarm water...   And now I’ve built this fortification around me, but it’s so cold... and I can’t get out.  No one can get in, no one can get out.  But I’m trapped now, and so cold... so very, very cold...  “Did you exchange A walk-on part in the Wall, For a lead role in a cage?”  Not many people understand that Pink Floyd line, not really, but I do.  And I did... I had a chance, I remember it so very faintly.  I had a chance to escape when I was little.  Someone gave me that choice: a moment of fame in life or the limelight in your own head?  I chose the latter... and look where it’s gotten me!  Paranoid, depressed, and cynical... because I found out that stage lights are hot, and can burn... but stone is too cold to offer any relief...  “So, so you think you can tell, Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field  From a cold, steel rail? A smile from a veil?”  No, I can’t... not with this blurred vision, anyways... too many lenses, too many masks, too much protection... and now I can only be deemed a hopeless case.  There comes a point where a person no longer wants to leave the pain they’ve known for so long; the “caged bird” syndrome.  Cliché, I know, but so true... because with all this protection around me, I’ve let myself grow weak, to the point where my walls are the sole things that keep me from being crushed under the weight of everyday living.  Isn’t that pathetic?  Everyone deals with the same thing (generally), yet I’ve become so weak and so paranoid, I’m the only one who can’t deal with it.  I know it hurts everyone, but I just can’t face it without all my guards... I’m just too weak.  Like the Giraffe People!  Those women in Africa who lengthen their necks with rings... if those rings are ever taken off, their necks are so weak, they break, but yet everyone else’s necks are just fine.  That’s what it’s like... I’m under the same gravity as everyone else, but I’ve decayed so, I _need_ my walls... my cold walls, and my burning limelight...

						   Things are a bit better, I suppose.  I’ve finished my GAII project... well, it’s not all the way done, but I turned it in ‘cuz it’s close enough.  Also, I don’t have much homework or studying, even though finals are next week.  That’s always nice, especially since I have to watch J’kar since he’s still not housebroken.  Let us see... anything else?  Uh... I don’t think so... I’ve got such a lame life.  And Fates, I wanted to do something racy today!  SO BADLY!  Sam and I felt like such hippies... drugs, sex, and rock-and-roll!  Make love, not war!  But we’re too straight-edged and we never have a chance to do anything, so yeah... as Freud would say: “Their id is very suppressed.” In a very German accent, of course.  And speaking of sex, I’ve gotta be frank with you all.  I’ve been thinking about my actor/singer, bisexual, sadomasochist ex-boyfriend, Jeff, way too much for my own good.  I know it’d never work out and I always feel so incompetent and shitty when I’m around him, BUT I WANT HIM BACK!  Yesterday was ‘our’ second ‘anniversary’ since he broke up with me... yet I still think about him hourly.  It’s terrible; I have no self-respect.  I know he’d hurt me (physically), and I’d let him... I’d lead him to believe that I was a masochist again.  But I’m not!  I always hated it... but I always felt like I deserved it.  I always wanted him to hit me harder, to hurt me more.  Because that was just.  But... he didn’t, thankfully.  Please, if there is any mercy in this barren world, make me numb.  I don’t want to feel anymore.  Not his hands... no, I don’t want to remember.  I don’t want to remember the pain, the blood.  He only drew my blood once, true, but it was my purest blood... and now I am tainted.  No one wants broken merchandise... not even the one who broke me, so it seems.

						   Bad Smauss!  I haven't written in forever.  Heh... you should see my "real" journal.    That   one's real bad.  Oh, well.  On May 8th, my mother, Sam, Stephanie and I picked up J'kar, my new Doby puppy.  He'd gotten so big, he was nearly unrecognizable!  But he's a sweetheart and I love him to death... I get frustrated, true, but I can't help it.  I get frustrated with breathing, no joke.  I'm overly behind with my Graphic Arts II project, but I'm working my ass off to get it done.  Hopefully I will... hopefully...  And, of course, I just got my bimonthly argument with my mother.  Damn, those keep getting worse!  I can't even describe... I prolly have another truant marking on my police record(the first one's because I sat on Steph's porch for three hours and did homework; shame on me), she threatened to institutionalize me/have me arrested -again-, and it was all because I wanted to have a break from doing my goddamned GAII project that I had nearly killed myself on!  And now she insists on interrupting me whenever I'm doing anything I enjoy so I only get a quarter of the time that I usually do!!  Oh, well.  At least I have my beloved friends, my reptilian babies, and my little puppy.  It's worth living for, I suppose.  Plus, I just have to make it through 'til the 26th of May and school will be over.  Just live 'til then...

						   Notes to Self When Spiking Hair: 1. PLAN!!  Take little rubber bands... try to figure out  what to do with the front. 2. START WITH THE BACK. 3. Put lots of the spiker stuff on the BASE.  Heh... I spiked my hair for the first time today.  It didn’t turn out too good, but it was my test run and my first time EVER spiking hair, so it isn’t too bad.  But yeah... those are my tips for next time.  Gods I wanna dye my hair!  What the hell is it with my hair...?  No!  PLEASE!  I’m NOT vain!  *runs away screaming*  Yep, I still need a life.

						   Once again, shame on me for not writing in so long.  Bad, bad, Smauss!  But I’ve been busy! *gasp* I know, it’s hard to believe, but I have!  First off, Stephanie’s mother is crazy... in the good way, but still crazy.  While Steph and her father were gone, her mother called me to help with yard work. *raises an eyebrow* Yeah.   I  thought it was strange!  My friend’s mother, who I thought rather disliked me, calls me to do yard work!  Paid labor, of course, but still...!  I’m not sure when that was, though.  Earlier this month, me thinks.  Also, one of my mum’s friends came down from Canada.  She’s massively cool... her name’s Linda.  She’s been staying with us, and she’s just fun to talk to and be with.  And she has a Harley!  It’s in the shop, but still!  Already she has my approval. *winks*  On June 30th I’ll be leaving for New York, and I’ll be staying until July 28th!  I’m  so  excited... I’ve been waiting for that forever!  And my Uncle Conrad’s even getting Internet access so I won’t go crazy!  AND RED SWEDISH FISH!  OHMYGOSH! *salivates*   More good news, too!  Isn’t it great?!  I got a court notice saying that I had to testify against my psycho father, but the District Attorney  made it so I don’t have to go since the trauma would be too great!  I don’t have to see that psycho-bastard-filth!  Yay!  It’s bad enough that he’s been here in town, but at least I don’t have to go to court!

						   Well, my month here in New York is up; I'm waking up at 4 am Eastern Time to get to the plane... yucky...   I went to the races again on Friday, and that was great fun. It was the Speedway (which I'll explain when I get home, lovies) championship and Carl knew one of the guys, Kyle. On one race, some poor rider was ahead the entire four laps by a whole lot, but in the last 20 feet of the track... his chain broke! So he had to push his bike across the finish line, and because of that all the other guys passed him within 2 feet of the finish line and he came in last!! How much does that suck?! But it was so cool... Kyle won the championship for the 2nd year in a row! We met him in the pits, but he was really busy, so we only got to say congrats, but I got to shake his hand... and he was pretty cute. :)   Monday I had such a great day, though! Carl came over and he taught me how to ride! Oh, it was so great! I only fell over twice, once on my first time around the yard and the other because I was trying to change gears and I wasn't paying attention. Eventually I even got up to 2nd gear! Somehow... it was pretty hard, but it seems like one of those things that you learn pretty quick to do without thinking about it. My top speed was 12 mph, but that's really friggin' fast on a motorcycle for your first time. I was really proud of myself and I've got lots of pretty bruises from falling. Afterwards, Carl took me back to his house and taught me how to braze (pretty much soddering with brass) and I made a picture frame LOL I like it, it makes me smile.   Today was pretty good too. I walked all around Youngstown, literally. It took me about two and a half hours, but I swear I walked down ever road for at least a few feet. I was even going to be adventurous/stupid, too, but decided against it. You see, there is this old abandon storage company on Elliot Street near here, and I stood in front of it really wanting to go in and explore... but I decided against it. I kinda regret not going in, I wanted to be brave and follow my curiosity for a change. After all, I'm smart enough not to be too stupid, but no... I'm too wussie. Anyways, it took me an hour to find Main Street where all the stores are... the whole reason for this trek was to get presents for the two of you (being Steph and Sam). But there's nothing on Main Street in the way of gifts! Can you believe that?! I got really upset, so I started down Main Street farther, and saw a sign that said Old Fort Niagara, the old Revolutionary War fort, was nearby. I've been there and they had a really cool gift shop, but my feet were hurting and I thought it might be closed cuz it was starting to rain. However, I learned that it wasn't;t closed and admission is free... so now I feel like an ass for not going and buying you two cool gifts. I apologize... I'll make it up to you, promise.  Well, I better go to bed, I have an early morning tomorrow... sleep well, both of you! Oh, but remind me about the Goo Goo Dolls, the two of you... I've gotta tell you something! Anyways, sweet dreams, dreamless sleep...

						   I'm a wee bit disappointed. Everyone's at work during the week and I really haven't gotten to do much. I swear, if I don't get to ride a motorcycle with Carl because I chickened out I'll throw myself into the Eerie Canal!  Like I said, not much has happened... which is sad, but oh well. I did however get to see my old friend Larry and go to a rubberband-airplane contest thing. It was really windy so not many people flew their planes that day, which sucked because a lot of people come a long way to do this, but I got the meet a lot of really cool old guys. There was this one guy who was 76 that had this little tiny harmonica that he could play with just his mouth, no hands, and would do the jig! He was so nice! One of those people who you just love to hear talk... and he'd go off on tangents worse than you, dove! (I'm guessing that only Steph's reading this... but I guess that'd work for Sam too.) You would've loved him, dearie. There were a few younger guys, about 19 or so, and I got a few looks from them, so that made me feel really good. It was so nice to see Larry again too! He was great! We hung around a lot and just talked about random things. I really forgot how much he was like my dad. Not like my grandpa was, but in a different way. It was so sweet, too... he kept bragging about me and so many of the guys there knew about me and called me "exceptional" and "a great kid" and all this nice stuff.   Other than that, I've been pretty bored. I haven't really called many people because I don't want to be a bother, but I think I will just because I've been so bored.   I've really liked all the summer reading so far.  The Scarlet Letter  made me cry and I enjoyed  The Glass Menagerie , and so far  Huck Finn  has been a real fun read. The weather's been pleasant but rainy... uh, I think that's all the questions you asked in your diary thingy, Steph. And I understand having little time to post, but I'm just so glad that you're RPing with me! It's so great! And by the way, on Friday Mekare will be on 9 pm  her  time... 10 pm our time. Oh, and Buffalo is right near Canada, near Lake Eerie. And no, I haven't been to the Anchor Bar yet.   I miss the both of you! Glad to hear you're having a great time in NJ, and I can't wait to come home and see you again, Sam!

						   Ohmygod!  I hate VCR/DVD Players!! *screams* Today, I spent   4 HOURS  , since 9am to 1pm, trying to hook one up for my uncle.  That wasn't supposed to be so fucking hard!  But I got it to work... finally.  Other than that, the last two days have been uneventful.  I've just been hanging out while my uncle's at work, but I like not having to do much.  Er, I guess that's it for now...

						   Woohoo!  I'm in Youngstown, New York, currently with my psychotic (or rather, sycotic) uncle... but it's been great! *eats a Red Swedish Fish* We now have Internet and I can continue RPing again, and I also have  so much  I can't wait to do!  Okay, from the beginning.  The plane ride here wasn't bad at all, although since I was an unaccompanied minor they treated me like I was six.  That was annoying, but it was tolerable.  Once we got home after dinner, 'we' being my uncle and I, I fell right asleep.  Or rather, I did once my cramps subsided.  What a day to get your period, neh? *rolls her eyes*  Not much happened on the second day here... I pretty much relaxed and got settled in.  I did meet my uncle's barber, though, and he's a really interesting older man.  That night, I pretty much got to meet all of Youngstown, 'cuz my uncle and I were sitting out on the porch, and here in WNY (Western New York) that means that all the neighbors'll come and chat.  It was really cool, since all the people I met were so nice.  It was kinda surreal, 'cuz that  never  happens on the west coast.  The next day we went to a restaurant called "The Silo"... it was once a grain silo that received grain from a train that would go by and distribute it to ships on the river!  So, needless to say, it's right next to the river (I don't know which one).  After lunch, my uncle and I took a nice walk next to the river, and then went furniture shopping. We pretty much did some running around and just did a whole bunch of errands while my uncle showed me around.  And guess who came to dinner...? Carl, one of my mum's old friends, and his son!  We chatted and just hung out.  But yesterday was the best!  Carl came over and I helped (er... rather watched) him and his son Bill (who's 13, FYI) repair the brake (yes, singular) on Bill's Kawasaki flat-tracker.  I learned a lot... like what a crush washer is and a whole bunch of odds and ends.  Carl really knows his stuff, but he's a very "do as I say, not as I do" kinda person 'cuz he's really good at stuff so he takes a lot of risks most other people shouldn't.  Then the three of us went to Carl's brother's, Gary, place to ride around.  They were gonna teach me how to ride, and I sat on a bike collecting myself, but we didn't have much time so we didn't get around to it.  I'm still kinda kicking myself for not just going for it and taking so long to calm down, but they promised we'd go out another time.   Then  I'll be ready!  After that, we went to Canada to see the bike and ATV races... which was so friggin' cool!!!!  OMG!  I really didn't think I was much of a race-person, but you really get into it while you're there.  It's really cool when you know someone (Carl knew a guy there) and you're cheering for him/her... after a while, I loved cheering someone on so much I either picked a random person to cheer for or I cheered for the girl(s).  It was so great- there were a lot of girls, and they  all  placed in the top three!  And also, in the 600 cc class, the fastest bikes they had, the person who won was   14   and it was his first time racing a 600!  He did so friggin' well it was scary, especially since he was half the size of everyone else!  It was such a wonderful experience... and to top it off, I saw this incredibly pretty gut there!  It took me a good 15 minutes to tell if it was a guy or a girl, already a sign I'd like him.  He had this perfect chocolate-brown hair that came to his shoulders and flipped out ever so slightly and was  so  well kept!  And he look absolutely stunning... he had on a nice black shirt, rather formal-looking, with a dark auburn button-down shirt over it... the kind that are made to just accent clothing and are kinda jacket-ish... and he had on black formal-ish pants and a nice dark red-brown leather jacket.  He just was so well dressed, it was amazing... that's why he first caught my eye.  He was long and lanky, and pale, with hands that Steph'd like, but long fingers like I'm fond of.  He wasn't that pretty in the face, but he was interesting... he'd've looked better if he smiled, me thinks.  Anyways, I got home about midnight and fell right asleep.  Not much has happened today... it's been raining, so I've been reading  The Scarlet Letter  (which I always get confused with The  Purloined Letter , which has a similar base idea).  It kinda bugs me, but the style I really like; it's really eloquent and not too terribly wordy.  Also, as you can see, my Uncle Con got the 'Net up, so I'll be on a lot once he goes to work.  He's kinda crazy... he has a white oak that he's grown from an acorn (it's six years old now and about six feet tall) that he's named "Weed"... every morning he looks out the window and yells, yes yells, "Mornin', Weed!" *rolls her eyes*  But he's cool, regardless...  That's about it... I'll update frequently from now on! *smile*
