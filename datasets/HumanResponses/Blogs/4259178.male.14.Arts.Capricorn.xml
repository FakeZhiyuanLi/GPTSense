      Ok. Aside from Aim, I HAVE F***ING NOTHING TO DO!! Since I am ordering a new computer, the internet on my old one has been disconnected(damn bastards as Frontier...) and now I can only use the internet at the library. I need some blogs to read. Please post links to any blogs that you think are worth reading. Thank you!!!

      I play the cello, as most of you who read my blog know(which is probably in a rough arithmetic mean 2.3 people), and I have made the most prestigious youth orchestra of Rochester, Hochstein Youth Symphony Orchestra. Well, RPYO might be a little better, but I hate those goddamn bastards, they think their all that, they think their so much better than us,   YEAH, WELL THEY CAN SHOVE IT UP THEIR!! .......  well, I'll save that story for later.   Anyway, aside from playing an extrenuating audition just to get into the orchestra, now I have to play virtually impossible excerpts just to be placed in the seating. I could just blow off this audition, but then I'd end up last chair and be the ass of the cello section. I could practice really hard and get a good seating, but then people will think that I'm a snooty loser that practices cello all day. I curse you choir members, not having to worry about seating.  A little side note to instrumentalists. I don't know about brass or wind players, but have you ever noticed that whenever you audition for any part, the audition excerpts are always extremely harder than the material you actually play? It's weird, cause once I tried out for this Chamber Orchestra, and they made me play the Haydn Cello Concerto, and if you don't play cello, it's REALLY, REALLY,   HARD.    Turns out, we were just gonna play songs like Ashokan Farewell.            Well, the audition draws nearer, and I am totally clueless. I am pretty much dead.                     Oh well, might as well have some pringles...

      I know I don't updated my blog as frequently as some of my friends do, or write as much as them, but I have three really good reasons why.   1:  I suck at writing(hence the title).  2:  I can't type very fast.  3:  Terrorists.     Well... Maybe not the last reason so much, but I still suck at English.   Now you may be wondering, why is a Chinese student bad at a subject? Why? I don't fit your American stereo-type!! I am different!!    1. Chinese people are unathletic. FALSE!!! I am gonna be in freshman basketball this year. YEEEAAAAAA!!!  2. Chinese people are smart at everything. PARTIALLY TRUE!!! Remember, I suck at English. I ain't no Elaine Zhong!!  3. All Chinese people love video games. FALSE!!! My dad hates video games.  4. All Chinese people play at least one string instrument ot piano.  True  (no comment)  5. The Chinese have the toughest parents. FALSE!!! Take a look at the Jewish mother.    So you see, even though there are a lot of Chinese people, not all of them are good at English in school(like me!). Another reason why I'm bad, I got off topic and discussed Chinese stereo-types in the U.S. instead of me being bad at English and I don't feel like going back deleting it after spending half an hour on it. Figures.   (P.S. Was that last sentence a run-on sentence?)

      Ahh... The summer days of Pittsford, New York . WITHOUT A SINGLE GODDAMN THING TO DO!!! ARRGGHHH!!!!!!!!! I went to camp this summer, some BBQs, had good times. Then I did pit orchestra for Suessical, the local play/musical. It was a great experience, but now that its over, I find myself sitting at home watchin' the Olympics with a can of Pringles(cheering on China, of course. w00t w00t!!), or talking to various friends on AIM. Today, my friend Cody told me that he had started a blog. After reading his blog (cholliday.blogspot.com), I found it very intruiging and have decided that i would start my own blog, having nothing better to do with my time(either write a blog, or gain 6 pounds by Pringles and TV, I went for the blog). Now everybody is starting their own blog!! Its okay. I don't mind. Its not about competition....
