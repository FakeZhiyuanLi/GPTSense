      Oprah Winfrey recently had a woman on her show who had a successful career as a school counselor, but as she approached menopause she began to feel a lot less of a woman. In an attempt to recapture the essence of her youth, she posed for some very extreme nude photos. She had not thought about how this would effect the community she lives in or the children whose lives she was in a position to alter for the good. The town was completely up in arms over the pictures when they got out. She had to resign from her job. I watched "Oprah, After the Show" the other day. The woman seemed so devastated. She was trying, through a storm of tears, to explain how it all made her feel. I felt for her because I knew that the real heartache was that at one time she had the ability to do something good and apparently she had strongly influenced a lot of students in a very positive way in the past. Her actions had robbed future children of being able to benefit from her strengths as a counselor. And lets not forget the cruelty that she is now subject to at the hands of an unforgiving community that is always waiting for a sacrificial lamb to unleash their judgments upon. It is always nice when someone puts their self out there for you to talk about so you can take the focus off of yourself for a while. Ah, the gossipy hearts are always ripe to jump into action. This woman appeared to be having a bit of a nervous breakdown on national television (nervous breakdowns which I strongly recommend - go ahead and cry honey). Oprah did not pander to the woman but what she said was real and it was the truth and it rang so profoundly in my heart. She said something to the affect that  God had given her the power to affect people's lives but that she apparently did not at one time recognize how awesome that was. Essentially, she did not see herself. The Lord saw this and delivered her through a situation that was entirely the result of her not recognizing her own power. Now that it is all said and done, she realizes what she had and she now sees who she is is a very significant instrument of God.  Oprah added that  once you see the lesson that you were suppose to learn, it is over and that is what "grace" is.  Wow! What a woman. I look back at decisions I have made since 2002 and I struggle to try to realize why I made some of the decisions I made. What was I thinking? Well I know what I was not thinking: I was not thinking about my own ability to affect others lives. The Lord saw this and He accompanied me through my mistakes and brought me through it to the other side. If I only learned this one thing from it all, I have perhaps learned the most valuable lesson of my life.

      I woke up with a bad taste in my mouth. I am a home health aide (I really am) and I was in a classroom with a room full of people and my client was sitting way over on the other side. He fell on the floor and was lying there on his back. I leaped to go lift him off the floor and I did not realize until I had him back in his chair that I was completely naked. Everyone was very grossed out. They told me so. Then I woke up and I am now thinking about a number of things. The first thing that occurs to me is. "THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY A DREAM!"

      Starting my blog is not the easiest thing. There are different kinds of blogs you could have and you can have several at the same time or you could just have one. Everyone has things about themselves that they do not want everyone to know -- maybe something that happened in the past. For instance (and this is perhaps an extreme example), lets just say that at one time in your life you had a stuffed animal fetish. You loved to roll around in a pile of stuffed animals when no one else was around. Obviously, you weren't sharing this with too many people at the time. However, as you grew in your wisdom and faith in God, you came to realize that your teddy bear fetish was really only a symptom of a much deeper problem. Along the way, as your obsession increased in its intensity, you perhaps committed some truly ungodly acts with pooh bear (boy this really is an extreme example). However, The Lord dealt with you and delivered you out of your sinful psuedo-beastialistic ways. Now, you are free of the affliction of pseudo-beastialism. However, something pulls at you to want to share your experience with others because you feel that if only you could convey the experience with untainted honesty, you could some how use it to glorify God.  I think I have been awake far too long.  So what should you do? Should you go forth and begin proclaiming yourself saved by God and begin detailing the realities of your nightmarish obsession with pooh-pooh? Or should you deny it to the end and go forth to walk in a newness of life, reaping the benefits of your newly found, God given wisdom? Or even worse, what if somebody somehow found out about your Poohilism before you were delivered from it? How will you ever be able to face the world? What if someone has pictures? My point is this. How much of your self must you reveal in a blog in order to maintain its integrity as a genuine and complete representation of who you are? Are there not instances in which it is not what you do say but what you don't say that is faulty?
