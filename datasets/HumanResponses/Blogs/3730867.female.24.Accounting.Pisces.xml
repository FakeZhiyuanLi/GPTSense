      I am so excited to have a new car.  Though It's a little overwhelming.  This morning Matt and I met with the man with the stuff and I now own a brand new car!  It is absolutely wonderful. My car is a lovely green Ion 3.  I know that sounds kinda odd, a green car, but truly it is a good color...not too flashy.  I won't actually have possesion of the car until 5pm this evening when I get out of work.  Only 39 minutes to go.  I also had the opportunity to visit with my Grandmother today and see how she is doing.  I had to go see her to get my GM discount code for the car and she graciously did everything I needed her to do.  I should be a better granddaughter and visit more often .  I am sure she gets so lonely there all by herself and get this...she has never learned to drive so she cannot go anywhere without someone driving her.  Can you imagine?  I cannot believe how fast this non exsistant summer is going!  Tomorrow is July 1st.  Next thing you know it will be September and time to get back into the hectic life of Work, School and life.  I am so looking forward to that@!   "What will happen to a face in the crowd when it finally gets too crowded.

      I am now driving a Saturn Ion.  Not officailly yet but they let me take for the night to make sure I want that car.  It is so much fun, no more shifting!!  It is such a nice day out, I don't want to be here at work.  Wishing for a nice beach to appear outside and for me to magically be clad in a swimsuit and ready for sunbathing.  Damn, it's not working.  Well at least I can sit and enjoy the sun for some of the evening when I attend the Lugnuts game just to be in the company of Matt.  He is so busy with work and the Lugnuts that I barely get to see him.    I cannot wait for this long 4th of July weekend ahead.  I am very burnt out at work.  I just don't want to be here.  And thankfully Matt and I have a week long vacation planned in a little over a week.  We are going to visit his parents in Missouri, whom I adore.  Caitlyn is coming along too and it will be her first plane ride so she is exstatic.  "Dance with me, because if you've got the poison, I've got the remedy"

      Melissa I blame you for this!  This is offically my first blog.  I have enjoyed reading Melissa's, so I thought why not jump on the bandwagon.  Just returned from a fun and sun filled long weekend in Traverse City.  It was a nice little escape from reality.  Our friends Brian and Betsy had a joint bachelor/bachelorette party up in TC and we had a blast.  Nothing like getting loopy on the cosmos and riding around in a taxi van with crazy cats in a town you know nothing about.  Today is the day that I will become poor again.  I am buying a much needed new car.  My car choice...a Satun Ion.  A cute little car that I can actually afford.  But this means I must give up my tiny shopping habit, not sure if I can do it so wish me luck.  Oh good news has come my way, thanks to the knowledge of my girl Amy...Jason Mraz is coming to town!!  If your reading this and asking yourself who is Jason Mraz, your crazy for not knowing but i will forgive you.  In short he an amazing singer/songwriter and he is coming to MSU on 8/28!

      Why did I take my bra off in the tanner?&nbsp; Ouch!  At what point will I get enough sleep as to not wake up so very tired?  Coffee...good or bad/awake-good, jittery-bad?  When will I have time to do what I want to do?  Why does saddness come and go for no reason?  Is there ever a point where we don't want something more than we have?  "She will be loved".&nbsp; Song by Maroon 5, very cool.  Will Caitlyn survive the mess that is her/my life?  Today feels like Friday.  Why did cancer choose my dad?&nbsp; Will it choose me?&nbsp; Matt?&nbsp; Caitlyn?  Round brushing the back of your hair is hard!  Music is needed, good songs bring me to tears.  Why do people hurt eachother?  What do my dreams mean?  My world is so small.  I need motivation.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm glad that it is almost quiting time here at work.&nbsp; Just can't take the madness anymore.&nbsp; I finally figured out how to put my pic on my profile but not too happy with it.&nbsp; It's way too small and fuzzy.&nbsp; Anyone know how to make it bigger?&nbsp; Bigger is always better.  My dress dilema has been solved, some magician at Lett's bridal is going to alter it by Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; No more liquid diet!&nbsp;   Last night Matt and I went to Trippers and watched and amateur comedy show.&nbsp; Matt had to be a judge and I had to be the tag along groupie.&nbsp; It was as bad I thought it would be, there were some funny cats there.&nbsp; The winner will go on to the next round and compete for a chance to be on some show on Comedy Central.  My friend Amy just emailed me 31 pictures that were taken the night of her b-day party.&nbsp; I will post some they are silly!!  &nbsp;

      Major dilemma!!&nbsp; I am in a wedding on Saturday and I thought to myself yesterday, "I better try on my dress again to make sure it fits" and guess what?...It doesn't!&nbsp; I must have acquired some weight in the last monthor two&nbsp;and now the top will not zip up at all! Crap, it's a bousteae' (sp) type of top that can not be let out because of all of the ribbing!&nbsp; So today I am starting a five day liquid diet, only coffee and water for 5 days.&nbsp; So if you see me and I am cranky, you now know why.   Any other suggestions for losing a quick 5lbs in the next week would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I suppose I&nbsp;must exercise too, guess I will have to dust off those Windsor pilates DVD's and do them double time and maybe take my doggy for a couple of runs.&nbsp;   Weekends suck...when they're over.&nbsp; Seems like Friday, Saturday and sunday last for 10 hours combined and then poof Monday is here again.&nbsp; We did get one thing accomplished, Matt mowed down our jungle in the back yard on Saturday.&nbsp; You should have seen him, clad in long pants, long sleeve shirt and gloves; he's deathly afraid of getting poison ivy, it was very funny to watch him.   Since I have wasted a good hour of my monday morning, I suppose I must start some actual work here a my job.&nbsp; Hope all who read have a fantastic Monday, as I am sure I will!

       Yesterday was Amy's birthday and we celebrated a little too hard.&nbsp; Let's just say my head is pounding this morning!&nbsp;I cannot concentrate on work&nbsp;at all. &nbsp;I think we took appox 50 pictures last night, we seem to be camera crazy when we get together and include our buddy&nbsp;alcohol.&nbsp; I will post some pics&nbsp;when she emails them to me, then you can see how silly we are.   Finally the weather is as it should be for summer.&nbsp; In the 90's and&nbsp;sunny, now I wish I had a pool to lounge at.&nbsp; Too bad our back yard is a jungle and it wouldn't be possible to place a pool amoungst the crazy things growing back there.&nbsp; One day Matt and I are going to tackle the insane overgrowth and make it look all nice and neat but we have to work up the courage to make an attempt first.&nbsp; If you've seen it you know what I am talking about.   Saw Julia on Monday.&nbsp; It's been awhile...too long. The last time we hung out was in May for Brooke and Kara's graduation party/campout.&nbsp; That was the night Joe told me scary stories about the woods&nbsp;so&nbsp;I couldn't go to sleep in my tent alone.&nbsp; It was his fault that I&nbsp;made him and Julia sleep with me in my tent.&nbsp; But I got the idea that&nbsp;he didn't mind&nbsp;when he proclaimed, "I'M IN THE MIDDLE!!".   Since I am not in the mood to work today I've been tooling around on the internet and I found out some interesting new info about NIN.&nbsp; Trent is still in the midst of production for the new album  Bleedthrough .&nbsp; He said it is set to be released in early 2005 and they will be touring heavily to support the album!&nbsp; You know me I'm going to hit every&nbsp;show in MI.&nbsp; The new website is really great (nin.com).&nbsp; The content is very simple and direct, no flashy graphics or secret ways to get&nbsp;info like the old one.&nbsp; It's just a white page with typewriter type font on it.&nbsp; And there is a place where you can ask Trent questions and he answers them, that's where I got the info from above.&nbsp; Another interesting fact; Dave Grohl (foo fighters) is playing the drums for the entire album, he is a genius at drums so that should be good.   I also found the following helpful information on hangovers, since I am suffering from one at this very moment, enjoy:  &nbsp;  Most experts think that a hangover is a mild form of alcohol withdrawal, which distresses the body, leads to dehydration and makes you feel awful. Below is a list of foolproof tips to help ease you through that painful morning after:  &nbsp;  Drink lots of H2O.&nbsp; Alcohol is a diuretic; it dehydrates our cells, causing us to feel tired, headachy and generally out of sorts.&nbsp;   Get plenty of salt and potassium. Heavy drinking purges the body of these two important electrolytes, which together help transport and distribute nutrients and water throughout your body. To restock your body with these two essentials, try a sports drink, or eat a potassium-rich kiwi or banana.&nbsp;   Fill up on fruit juice. Fruit sugar (fructose) is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, so any kind of juice will give your energy level a big boost-- fast. In addition, some studies have shown fructose to play a part in speeding up the rate at which the body eliminates toxins -- including those from alcohol. Orange and tomato juices are good bets.   &nbsp; Don't forget your B and C vitamins. Supplies of these two are severely depleted when you drink -- thanks again to alcohol's diuretic effect -- so when you're consuming alcohol, your system needs these vitamins&nbsp;more than ever. There's no time like the morning after a big night out to load up on supplements. &nbsp;Better yet, get your dose naturally in a glass of fresh-squeezed fruit juice.   Caffeinate or pop a painkiller. Alcohol causes blood vessels to swell, which can also lead to serious head throbbing. Caffeine counteracts that, but since it's also a diuretic, limit yourself to just one cup of coffee. If that doesn't work, use ibuprofen, but skip aspirin -- it could help heal your pounding head, but this over-the-counter drug is known for wreaking havoc on a tender tummy.           "I beg you to pay attention to coincidences. People who appear in your life for the simplest of reasons usually offer us the best clues on what to do with our lives. Those connections make up the music of today, remind us of our youth, and keep us believing that the truth is out there and that happiness may be just around the next corner of the roller rink."

      Vacation is over and I am not happy about it.&nbsp; But who would be.&nbsp; Matt and I had a blast in Missouri with his parents.&nbsp; I enjoyed many days of lounging by the pool, much to my content!&nbsp; We lazied around their beautiful house most of the days and relaxed on the porch by the pond to fill our evenings.&nbsp; Much alcohol was involved on a few nights and funny stories were told about Matt's childhood.&nbsp; Fun fun time. &nbsp; Jim (matt's dad) also took some awesome pics of Caitlyn while we were there.&nbsp; He is a professional photographer and a good one at that.&nbsp; I will post some of the pictures here soon. &nbsp; On a much sadder note...Friday before we left we found out some very unfortunate news.&nbsp; My dad will no longer be going to Irac (which is good)&nbsp;because he has been diagnosed with Cancer (which is bad!).&nbsp;&nbsp;We found out that he has prostate cancer and has had it for at least&nbsp;a year.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be going through surgery here shortly,&nbsp;he will have to have radiation to follow-up and then will have to be on hormone therepy for 4 years after that.&nbsp; We are all praying that these things will work to kill the cancer and&nbsp;I can have&nbsp;my healthy dad back.&nbsp; As for the present&nbsp;he has had a bone&nbsp;scan/cat scan to make sure the cancer hasn't spread.&nbsp; The doc said the&nbsp;he has an&nbsp;"aggressive" case&nbsp;and it is highly possible that it has spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should find out the results to that today and I will post the news shortly after I do find out.&nbsp; I know all who read this will keep my dad in your prayers and/or thoughts and I thank you for that! &nbsp; &nbsp; "I tried to find the logic logically.  I had a dream and I could not shake it.&nbsp; &nbsp;  There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand" &nbsp;

      Work is so unnecessary sometimes...at least in my mind.  I really don't want to be here doing my daily tasks that will just be redone again and again. It just seems so pointless.  I would much rather be... hmmm, at the Ledges. Remember the ledges Melissa, Brooke, Kara and Julia?  We should take a trip down memory lane and visit our old outdoor adventure spot soon.  I would love to be climbing the ledges, discovering new caves and crossing that tressell as the train gets dangerously close!  Ah to daydream about the past.  At times it makes me sad that we can't go back, just for a day or two.  I popped some Pink Floyd into my radio the other day, and as "Wish you were here" blasted through my speakers, I remembered when we used to sit around a fire and sing the words (way out of tune) while Chris Kouts strummed the guitar.  Those were the days.  Not to say I am unhappy in the present but sometimes I just miss my naive youthfullness.  Sorry about my trip down memory lane, it just hits me sometimes.  I will be flying amoung the clouds tomorrow morning.  We will finally be on vacation.  Oh, I'm sure it will fly by and soon I will be back here at work, wishing I was somewhere else again.  But for now I am going to imagine it lasting forever.  I am more excited than Caitlyn for her first plane ride.  I promised her a window seat so she could see the beauty that is the sky above the clouds.    I wonder if she will be a dreamer like me when she grows up.  Will she dream about her past with her 4 closest friends and wish to return too?

      Well today I must work and then go home and do more work.  How fun is that?  We leave for MO on Saturday so I have to do all of our laundry and that is a lot of f'ing laundry.  Since we will be gone for 5 days I will have to pack at least 15 outfits for Cailtyn and I and Matt will want to pack 3 so I must clean clothes today!  Yesterday I had quite a scare!  My new radio in my new car would not accept any of my Jason Mraz cds, I know what your thinking...,"oh lord, how terrible, what did she do?"...well I tried other cds too and it still wouldn't play anything.  At this point I am a little releaved because my radio is not just boycotting Mraz music it is boycotting all tunes.  So I drove on down to the dealership and they put a brand spankin new one in that likes all of my music.  So I say hasta la vista to my other  radio!  C-ya!  Do you want more bad news?  Jason Mraz is coming to MSU on Aug 28th and Matt said he could hook me up with good seats and possibly a meet and greet but nooooooo I have to go to my cousin's wedding that day!  I know it's selfish of me to want to be somewhere else on a family member's special day but I'm just being honest by saying "damnit man why can't she get married the next week."  I'll call everybody and tell them the date has been changed myself.  Oh well whatcha gonna do.  Good news...I am officially enroute to getting my bachelor's degree now.  I have enrolled at Davenport U as of yesterday and will hopefully be done by Jan 2050.  Just kidding, hopefully I only have 2-3 years left.

      Thank god it is friday today!  I am looking forward to the long weekend for sure.  Matt and I plan to visit our favorite sushi bar for the last time tonight :o(.  Unfortunately Shiki (aka Mirasaki) is closing it's doors for good today.  So we will raise our saki glasses in salute to a fine establishment that will be no more.  Not much planned for the holiday weekend ahead.  Maybe some golf tomorrow.  Matt and I took up the expensive sport about a month ago and I am getting a little better...I make contact with the ball now.  Sunday we will probabaly BBQ with our friends Scotty & Jenn, Brian & Betsy and Billy.  Should be a fun relaxing day.  And then monday Matt has to work so I might work on my tan then if the weather cooperates.  Hope all who read this have a safe and fun 4th of July weekend.

      Well after an excellent time was had on Saturday, at our friend Billy's house, we found out today that Matt had cracked his ribs because of too much fun in the dunk tank! Yup you read that right, Matt not only was in a dunk tank on Sat. but he is now in mucho pain because of it. Let this be a lesson not to mix beer and dunk tanks.  Despite the injuries that came out of Sat, Billy's party was a blast. We partied for 12 hours straight. Bits of our partying included Holt firemen and their big red truck, dunk tanks, good food, good beer, good music, bocce ball, and hot tubbing. No the fireman didn't come to put out a fire, they were friends of friends who came to party. Me and my girls, Val and Amy, got to climb inside the big red truck and get our picture taken. And Amy even gave her digits to a cute young fire boy!  So obviously Sunday was our day of rest, as not much happened but laziness and a bit of moaning on Matt's part...due to his sore ribs.  Yesterday was another boring day at work and today is much the same. But I guess I better not take these boring, uneventful days for granted because as of next week it's back to school for Caitlyn and I. I'm absolutely stoked about that! Can't you tell?  And soon I will be a full time mom again, no more joint custody with her pops. He decided to move away on us. Not necessarily a bad thing but not so good for Caitlyn either. She is really sad :o( and I am left to pick up her little broken heart. Ahh, life is so good sometimes. I just need to remember that something positive will come of all of this and that is that my beautiful baby girl and I will be so much closer in the end after all we've been through!   Don't get me wrong cause I don't want to know what the truth is I believe that I'd be here with or without it All that lies around put me where I am, where I stand

      Or is it?  Had a intuitive converstation with a friend today and found out this...that the grass is indeed NOT always greener on the other side. When you are stuck in a rut and going through tough times you tend to think that everyone has it better than you. But truely, they may be just as miserable or even more than you. So what we all need to do is be optimistic and know that eventually life will play it's course and start to look up. I cannot go through life hoping and wishing i had what I don't have. I need to be happy with what I do have and work hard for the things I want.  So starting today, I'm going to try to think positive. Easier said than done, believe me I know.  1st positive thought... I think that eventually Caitlyn will appreciate all I have done for her instead of feeling anger towards me for taking her away from her father.  Found a silly yet thought provoking excerpt from mraz's journal entries and I thought I would share it here. Enjoy...     Excerpt from: I’ve seen hell and it departs from Heathrow:   I smoke. That’s obvious. It’s a hot topic, literally. So when I have time to kill at an airport, what better way to do it than to go suck down a few fags and drag the words from my head? It’s been said that a cigarette will take minutes and eventually years off of your life, depending on how you stack them up. I can’t think of a better place to apply this theory. Smoking at an airport is time traveling. This particular smoking lounge is more than that, however, I’ve crossed into another dimension, somewhere on the proverbial other side. It’s a long green corridor paralleled by green skinned aliens from all nations and distances far, far away. There is smoke billowing from every orifice of their bodies. Men, women and children and the occasional undetermined gender all share a common destination this morning in this cavern of cancer. Maybe it’s more like purgatory than hell itself, and we’re just training for the ultimate burn barn that awaits us all when our flight number is finally called. The burn could be better described in our lack of smoking on the flight than the plane actually exploding and charring our flesh along with our hopes and dreams and tearing us from our families. I imagine everyone in here dwells more on being kept from their precious smoking habit than being taken away from their travel plans, be them business or holiday. We’re all sick in here and we don’t deny it. We openly share our distaste in air and work as a unit to ruin it. We’ve come of age where don’t give a shit for public places as it shows on our grim faces and grows like shoelaces from the tips of our nicotine sticks. We walked miles to get here and here we are, rising stars from the new generation, not celebrities, but heated balls of gas far too dense to see the light and not yet solid enough to stand on. We are no longer a shocked culture when we arrive at wherever we are. We only want to get closer to the love in our minds that confines us to love only ourselves, and that love is bare and carefree and couldn’t care less about the color of our skin, external or within, we are scars of bars and smoking in cars and anywhere there are too few open windows. We shun the weight of purity, this being light and the equivalent of oxygen, be it in an air conditioner. We are well wishers for a kitchen sink or anyplace we can think of to dispose of the ash that we have created. We are artists of the lowest kind, though our thoughts about what we do supersedes all others by comparison thanks to abbreviation. We abbreviate time mostly. And we think less of our crimes assuming they are nothing of the kind. We are smart to our philosophies but not to our hearts and tendencies for evolution. We are self-pollution and probably the worst thing that has ever happened to each other. If humanity knew what it was getting itself into we would’ve added nicotine to marijuana ages ago and this morning at Heathrow would be a livelier place for many a dull face and pacemaker on the run and the millions to come through this god awful room. We are the still image of BOOM! Exploding in slow motion. We are the emotion of non-emotion. We are the collective catastrophe. We are green with envy at those who chose to stay from this prose we play over and over again, wondering how we got here, realizing it, and then wondering why we came in. We are important in and of ourselves and we don’t understand anything remotely close to what we think we do. We’ve short-circuited our frontal lobes and reptilian pros and cons and any means of rationalizing clearly. We are leftovers from the day we died, that first day we tried smoking in the first place. Some of us were teenagers and some probably in the womb, without ever a chance to decide what to do or not to do with our beautiful lives. We were never healthy to begin with if we happened upon this. It was foolish to ever consider it. Now look where it’s gotten us, hurrying though life to see what’s on the other side and take pride in our uselessness and repent for our sins and begin our natural life in the society designed for our needs and supply. We try to build hell right here on earth for what it’s worth and suck on as much that sucks as we can muster. We are the cluster of misters and misses of misery and I, like the others, am not afraid of taking everybody with me so that someday I can be the one who’s free to claim that this is clarity and we, those few millions who choke on the smoke screen, are king and queen. The benefits and the revenge will be sweet, and we’ll change the rules on this school of where and when to participate in our sorry deeds. Our seats will be on the planes and trains and only those who smoke will complain that others don’t. This isn’t a joke. Folks are thinking about this, and those who didn’t will be pissed that they weren’t born again and they’ll miss their chance at being on the list to the biggest party called bliss. We will die first and know before all others what it’s like to ride in the hearse and experience the curse of hell. I can tell already that it’s not such a bad place except that it has a taste that leaves your mouth dry, comparable to an ashtray. Luckily on the long flight they’ll give us the travel toothbrush to be as fresh as possible upon arrival…

      I have posted a link to the new Jason Mraz cd/dvd player. You can get a sneak peek at the songs that will be on the cd/dvd that's dropping on Aug 25.  Rain sucks! Yeah, yeah it's good for the trees, grass and flowers but not me. It makes me a sneezy crabby girl! In fact I will count the total amount of times i sneeze today and report it back here tomorrow. You will be amazed that someone can still function after using so much energy to SNEEZE! As of right now, I have sneezed 36 times since 7:41 am and it's only 9:34 am. I know, you can't believe it, but please do, I am not a liar.  I tried to post this funny picture of me that my friend Nichole sent, but it's not happening. I'll try to give you a visual until I figure out how to post it. It's a picture of me back in 1993. I am attempting to pose like a model with my hand placed behind my head and my little itty bitty oh so nice tiny hips that I had way back when shifted to the side. My hair is awful, short and dorky looking. I am wearing a white T with Tweety bird boxer shorts, awesome outfit huh? It's really funny, wish you all could see it and laugh with me, I mean at me! It's so la la la lovely!!  Rain rain go away....

      It's so nice to be up in every one's beazzness! I love that all my friends are starting blogs so I can nose my way into their life. Welcome Jen!  What a weekend! Much fun was had. Friday Matt and I gorged on some greasy Mexican food at El Azteco, yummy! Saturday was an eventful day of golf with Matt, Paul, Aaron and Amy. We had fun even though the beeatch owner at Eagle View kept trying to split us up so we couldn't cause any trouble. What's the point of golf if you can't cause trouble? Afterwards we went back to our house for beer, vodka, botchy ball, more vodka, pizza and echre (all in that order) Needless to say, I eventually passed out!!  Sunday after I got my lazy booty out of bed I hooked up Jennifer for bloody mary's, softball, beer and more bloody mary's (all in that order). It was awesome to catch up with Jen, had a ton of fun hanging out even though a certain Mr. spoiled it in the end. Ahh well.  Now we are here on Monday, back to reality. I have not been able to surf the net and or keep in touch with many people via email today because our server keeps dying . What the hell do they expect me to do now....work?! I don't think so!  Already looking foward to the upcoming weekend. We have a B-day party to attend that entails Mr. Mojo in a dunk tank. Haa, I will probably pee my pants laughing at him!!

      I miss my best friend Amanda so much!  She is such a great person and it sucks to be so far away from her.  Amanda, if you're reading this, I miss you darling.  Last night was movie night with the ladies and it was so much fun.  We watched the movie 13 going on 30, so cute.  I laughed more last night than I have in a long long time.  It was needed.  And just so you all know, fluffy pillows rock!  Tonight is another round of "Thirsty Thursday" at the Lug Nuttys game, seems that we are in for a sunny night of beer, baseball and fun.  Can't wait.   But I must not get too tipsy I have to take my dear old grandmother to the Dentist at 8am.  I'm sorry but who makes an appointment to get their teeth cleaned that fricking early in the morning?  The dentist is torture enough as it is but to go there so early in the morning is insane!!  Ah well, I must do my good deed for the month and get my ass out of bed to take her...pat on the back for me.   I'm one curly fry in the box of the regular Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt People say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things Instead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings

      So I should go right? But I am too lazy to get up and walk down the hall to the camode. I'm sure I will soon, when my bladder crys out in pain.  Well here we are at Monday again. La dee fricking da! Not feeling any happier than my random thought day.  Reasons I am feeling blue lately...  for a very very dear friend cuz she has a broken heart.  for myself cuz I don't know if my heart is where is supposed to be sometimes.  for my dad cuz he is so exhausted.  for my toes cuz they can no longer see out of my shoes at work.  for Val cuz she has to deal with the people who are very angry about the new no toes policy.  for my daughter cuz she has no idea that her dad is leaving.  for my mind cuz it's filled with so much uneasyness. ____________________  But I am happy because...  I have wonderful friends  I have my health  I have my family  I have a roof over my head  I have music  I have love  I have faith in myself  Seems I have been using my blog as a venting board lately, and honestly it helps. It helps to put it out there and be able to go back and reflect on it all. I highly recommend it!  We are going to visit the children's garden this afternoon after work. I cannot wait to watch Caitlyn's face. I love it when she sees beautiful things, her whole face lights up and it's as if none of the stuff I listed above matters.     Your children will not be your children   They are the daughters and the sons of the beginning  They will come through your womb but not be coming from you  They will be with you but they do not belong to you  You can give them your love but not your thoughts   They will arrive with their own hearts   They are the coming of angels this blessed season   God rests in reason
