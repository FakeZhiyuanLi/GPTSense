      Double Magic Power After getting the magic powder, go to Smithy's Shop in Kakario Villiage in the Light World. Use the Magic Hammer on the stake and fall down the hole. Go up and throw Magic Powder into the red thing on hands. A bat will come out. When he's done, your Magic Bar will have a 1/2 on top of it. You now have double magic power! Submitted by - Mysterious Mike Final Boss Tactics When you get to the last boss, here's how to defeat him. Hit him a couple of times with your sword. He should throw his dagger at you. Try to avoid it. Do this another time. The third time you do this, he will twirl his dagger. Little fireballs will form around it. The balls will expand. Soon they will turn to fire bats. These bats take away 2 hearts. Try to avoid them. Keep hitting him with your sword. Do this step 3 times. When you finish, his dagger will be gone. Now his usual attack will be a power stomp that lets out a fire bat, that will make fire balls in its path. When he stomps, the floor will cave in on one side. If you drop through this, there will be 2 chests with treasures to help you. He'll stomp 4 times. Then the lights will go out. The 2 torches at the end of the room will go out. Light them with your torch or fire rod to see him. Hit him with your sword, then he will freeze. Quickly equip your bow and silver arrows. Shoot him once. The lights will go out again. Light them a second time to see him again, and hit him with your sword again. Equip your bow and shoot him with a silver arrow. Do this 1 or 2 more times and he will be defeated. A door will open and a bridge will appear. Go in the door to receive the tri-force. You have conquered the game! Submitted by - Mikey Hill (MLMQH2@aol.com) Get the 4th Magic Jar Beside the desert in the light world, there is a man who sits by a sign and he says to leave him alone. When you are nearing the end of the game in the dark world, in the village in one of the demolished houses, there will be a chest. You can't open it, so bring it to that guy in the light world who wants to be left alone. He turns out to be a theif and he will pick the lock for you, and inside the chest is the last magic jar. Submitted by - Renagade Webmasta Get the Magic Powder In the light world, when you are in the dark forest, you will see a rotted mushroom, you are allowed to put it in your item stash. It doesn't do anything, but take it and go to the witch who is brewing something beside the potion shop. Give the mushroom to her and she will say that she will give you something in return. So go in the shop, and beside the little guy sitting there, is a bag of magic powder. Submitted by - Renagade Webmasta Items from the Fat Ferry Near the end of the game in the dark world, you will see in the pyramid that there is a crack in it for a bomb to blow up. An ordinary bomb wo'nt do the trick, but a super bomb will. Go to the guy near the village selling bombs. He will have a big green one to sell to you, go and buy it, but be carefull, since it is so big, you cant carry it, you have to drag it to the pyramid. When you get to the pyramid, releace the bomb in front of the crack. It will blow a hole in the wall. Enter to meeet the fat fairy who will tell you to throw items into the pond. The only items you can throw in are your master sword, your arrows, and an empty magic jar. She will give you a #4 sword, silver arrows, and fill your empty jars with magic potion. Submitted by - Renegade Webmasta The Flute and the Duck Once you have the flute, if you play it in front of the weather vane in Kakariko, the duck will come and help you. He can transport you to many locations. Here they are: #1 Death Mountain#2 Witch's Hut#3 Kakariko Village#4 Link's Cottage#5 Warp Tile South of Eastern Palace#6 Warp Tile in Desert#7 Swamp Ruins#8 South of Lake Hylia Submitted by - Paul Shamilov Hint: Get Rupees Easily In the normal world (not the dark one), go to the area before the desert, just to the west of the swamps. Lift the large green rock to reveal a secret cave entrance underneath it. Enter this cave and lift the pots to find a total of 50 rupees. Go back out and re-enter this cave again and again to keep gaining rupees. Submitted by - AdhereFIEND420 Hint: Hookshot Invincibility When you fire the hookshot, no matter how far it extends, you will be invincible during its duration. Enemies will pass right through you. Use it to your advantage if you're surrounded. Submitted by - Doomknocker Super bomb Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 24812Submitted by: Neto ( gabrielibarra10 AT hotmail.com )Complete the Ice Palace followed by the Misery Mire Maze. Go to your house in the Dark World and buy the orange and white bomb. Glitch: Turbo dig Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 24711Submitted by: Neto ( gabrielibarra10 AT hotmail.com )When you get the shovel and the magic boomerang (the normal version may also work), you can dig very quickly. Throw the boomerang, quickly change to the shovel, and dig. The spot where the boomerang passes by will be dug. Glitch: Run very fast Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 24710Submitted by: Neto ( gabrielibarra10 AT hotmail.com )Jump off Spectacle Rock (near the first warp pad you find in the game) in the Light World and land on top of the cave entrance. You will go into the cave, but the screen change animation will glitch. You will appear in the middle of the screen, but none of the buttons (except Start and Select) will do anything. The only thing you can do at this point is save and quit the game. Glitch: Instruction manual error Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 24709Submitted by: Neto ( gabrielibarra10 AT hotmail.com )Under the items for A Link To The Past, the Roc's Cape is listed. However, it is really the Magic Cape. The Roc's Cape is only in The Four Swords. Hint: Hidden bee Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 24708Submitted by: Neto ( gabrielibarra10 AT hotmail.com )There is a secret bee that will never fly away from you. Go to the cave where the Ice Rod is obtained. In the cave next to that one is a statue of a fairy. Run into it and the bee will appear. The Chickens Attack Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 23711The Chickens found in Kakariko Village and other areas have a vendetta against you; that is, of course, if you attack them. Hit a chicken enough with your various weapons, whether it be sword, arrow, bomb, whatever, and the chickens will come from all directions to peck you! It's a storm of chickens! Not really a useful secret, but a good one none-the-less, wouldn't you say? Blind Spot In Tile Trap Rooms Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 23708In rooms with the poltregeist tiles, stand at the edge of the room and face the center of the room. The tiles will bounce harmlessly off the shield. Drastic Dark World Shortcut Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 23707Upon entering Dark World and completing the first dungeon, Link can enter the Thieves' Den dungeon in the Village of Outcasts and upon completing it, he can use the Titan's Mitt to get the Dwarves to upgrade the Master Sword from L2 to L3. Running Man Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 23710The running man in Kakariko Village, that dashes away from you each time you approach, can actually be caught up to. To catch him, run towards him with the Pegasus Shoes. It'll take some practice, but you can catch up to him. Nothing useful happens though, he just tells you about some various things that aren't very important. Still, it's fun to be able to catch him. The Waterfall of Wishing Platform: GameBoy Adv.Code: 23712A fairly important secret, the Waterfall of Wishing provides Link the opportunity to upgrade two of his very important items, his Shield and his Boomerang. The Waterfall of Wishing is located at the end of the river in which you get the Flippers from Zora, but on the opposite end of the river. Pass by the Witch's Hut, move the green stone to gain access to the river, and you'll be in the general vicinity. You need the Flippers to access the Waterfall of Wishing, however. Read the signs in the area to find its location, and then jump into the water. Swim north into a waterfall and you'll be in a secret cave. Now, approach the pond in the cave and it'll ask you to throw an item into the water. Throw your Shield in the water to get the Red Shield back, and your Boomerang in the water to get the Magical Boomerang back, both free of charge.
