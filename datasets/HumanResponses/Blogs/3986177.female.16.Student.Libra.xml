              Hey agen!  its been a while since i blogged, almost a whole week, huh? Ohh that for those who are confused, I published dat last blog on Sunday and then sumhow (I have no idea how) I published it agen on Monday… anywayz its been a crazy week. Crazy I tell ya!!  On Tuesday I heard sumfin dat I really wasn’t supposed to hear. Not for a while newaiz. Hehe u prolly all dying to know wat dat little secret is, but I’m not gonna tell u either =) sorry! Lets jus say I’m not sorry that I heard it. although it caught me a bit off guard n left me brain dead for the whole week. Maybe I’m exaggerating a little but that’s seriously wat it felt like. Head saying one thing, heart saying another, head hurting from thinking, heart breaking from hurting, heart changin its mind all da time… well u get me. If u think that this wouldn't affect me at all, ur a silly bugger. Hrmm I betta stop there before I give nethin away. Or have I already? Ok next topic…  Schools been fun. It was really bludgy this week, but that could jus be because I dun do my work newaiz. Big thanku to  anna  who helped me with my maths wen I was sick. I went to her house on Tuesday afta school. Haha its funny, both our mums talk like theres no tomorrow. We were supposed to leave at 7:30ish but ended up leavin at 9:45. They didn’t even realise me n anna were fallin asleep on da couch. I’m so proud of  nita ! I taught her to crochet in english n now she’s makin a mad red beanie. Ooh I’m proud of  larri  too, who figured how to crochet with a pen AND ate a handful of salt in english. Haha we also got our school fotos bac n I’ll scan em n put them up lata for u to look at my beautiful friends.  On Friday I had  KLOZ NCOUNTA  practice. Haha I luv goin there, its jus fun I swear. Tires me out tho which was bad cuz this was one of da few times I was gonna go out aftawards. Big thanku to  danny  for takin me to hillsong. Sorry I was dozin off, dat speaker wasn’t boring, I was jus sleepy. Its heaps different from my normal church, it got mad music n dancers n they talk bout cool things like sex n sexuality =) haha I had a great time n met sum really nice people n I feel bad cuz I can’t remember their names. They’re so friendly its cool!  Dis is becomin really long, huh? I’m nearly done I swear, one more thing… WE WON OUR HOCKEY GAME TODAY!!! 2 - nil! Yeaaah!! Go us!! we’re comin 2nd out of 8 teams and playin semi’s next week so wish us luck! hehe NOW I’m done =) lator aligators

          Today was seriously the only day I stayed at home (and wasn’t sick) in a loong time. At first I was angry cuz my mum sed I’ve been out too much n mad me stay home. Kloz Ncounta had a tryout for ‘miss teen philippines’ today n I was gonna miss it. I replied with a "fine then!" n went back to sleep angry. When I woke up I got over my bad mood very quickly =). My mum n dad went shopping and my sister went to work. Hehe that meant I had the hoouse all to myself!! I played sum music full loud, danced round like a complete psycho, played da piano n sung as loud as I could, did cartwheels n flips in my living room, hung with my baby dog chucky, watched harry potter, ate migoreng and even did sum of my homework! It was entirely ‘ella’ time n I lurvved it. Do whatever u want, whenever u want, however u want… its da best feeling!! I’m sure many people could argue that I could’ve used this time more productively and I should be doing sumthin more worthwhile, but lemme tell u this; doing sumthin that u love IS worthwhile. Its what keeps me sane, seriously! Haha I bet I know what ur thinking now, "this comin from a chick who likes doing cartwheels in her spare time"… Well all I’ve got to say is it makes me a happy little vegemite =) oh n ur mean. Haha getting of track… back to being alone in my funky spunky house. Eventually I got tired of being a psycho n plonked my ass down on da sofa. I didn’t move for 3 hours… well I slept for 2hrs n 15mins but for the remainder I literally sat, stared and thunk my brain to bits.  I thought about so many things. Funny how the mind works. One thing links to another which links to another, and soo on. In the space of one second its probably possible to think at least 3 different thoughts. I was there for 45 minutes -_-  The subject that crept up the most were my friends. So dats wat this blogs about. If ur my friend (and u know that u are) all I have to say is thankyou n I luv u all to bits. It makes me soo warm and tingly inside knowing I got people like u guys who care about me. Recent events brought this back to my attention. For those who don’t know I’ve been sick for more than a week. And although I hated it and I neva wanna go through that agen, it all made it worthwhile. The day before the big competition, Elite, Kloz Ncounta were at pcyc practicin. That’s when "The Fever" struck. I was lying down n shivering n I dun really remember much but everyone givin me jackets to keep me warm, sittin on my frozen toes, givin me yummy tea, and all tellin me I’d get better, it’ll only last a day, I’ll be able to dance in Elite. I seriously didn’t think I could, which made me cry cuz I didn’t wanna let all these special people down. We worked so hard to get this far n I was bout to ruin it all. *sigh* I was sucha sad sight, I got everyone down in the dumps. Great way to finish day day, huh? Well I gotta say a huge thankyou goes out to martin n richard who took me home that day. In a taxi mite I mention! I still say a bus would’ve been fine, $20 cheaper as well… nah jkz… for real, they’re my heroes. The next day I got many many messages from my friends who cudn’t make it. Sorry if I didn’t reply guys!! They meant a lot to me. All saying good luck n go get that trophy!! Haha even Anna called up straight afta she got back from the ski trip to ask how it was! My bestest cuzzin celina called up her friend durin our performance to ask how we were doin! My friends are da best =) Big thanku to mei, cath n louise who hauled their asses all da way to blacktown to watch! Ooh n darius&nbsp;for taking me home n for being the wonderful person dat u are.  With all this positive attitude n encouragement, who wouldn’t get better? I swear God must luv me. Make that me AND martin cuz I got him sick after he took me home. We were cured (even if it was only for dat 6 minutes we were on da stage). I wouldn’t trade that experience for the world. U know wat its like to have so many people cheering for ya? Puts u up on a high n u dun come down for hours… days even!! Hahaha I’m onto another topic… well maybe I’ll talk bout it more next time cuz I’m getting tired n I bet u dun wanna hear more mindless babble from my mouth. One last big THANKYOU and I LUV U to all my friends out there. Having u guys around makes me truly believe that I am da luckiest girl in da world =)

Nooo... im gonna miss it =(  Unfortunately played in the semis on saturday and lost 2 nil. I swear we were kicking their asssses all da way to timbucktoo in the first half, grrr i dun wanna talk bout it, it jus makes me mad. So that was the last game we're gonna play as a team cuz we're losing Beck and Jenna next year. Y do u have to be in year 12?! nah i'm kiddin... its not ur fault ur old =) We'll miss ya HEAPS!!!  Overall it was a great season, finishing 3rd ain't bad guys!! a whole lot better than last year... haha 'challenge cup'?? we didn't even win it!! We'll be even betta next year. Jus like the Hockeyroos!!! Can't wait til the hockey dinna, be there or be square.. whatever that means...  Today at skool was fun. Hip hop was mad, everyones getting betta and betta. Haha we're gonna burn da floor at the senior dance, which u girls ARE going to!! After that was lunch. We spent it inside the Campbell hall cuz it was coooold outside. Luckily the piano was there to keep us entertained! Being the Brady bunch family we are, we had a group singalong round da piano. Corny, i know, but who cares its fun!!! Sorry i ran outa songs to play, write me a list of 'special requests' n i'll learn them for ya. Newaiz halfway through Louise got all sad. She started to thinking bout how things would be like 2 years from now, i think... where would we all be? Would we still talk n act like total retards together? hey i could be wrong. Either way dun be sad babe!! There are many more cold, wet lunchtimes to come =)  newaiz hope u like the pictures!!! i'm off! - luv ella

      I touched an octupus. a LIVE one *shudders* suckers and all... I thought it was so interestin dat i had to tell everyone =) If yall wonderin, which undoubtedly u are, i went on a biology excursion!!  I had to get up at 5 in the friggin cold mornin n haul my asss up to school by 7:30. Not a very good start to the day but it soon got betta. I met up with my bio buddies,  Nita  n  Mei , at schoool n then caught a bus all the way to Collary beach. We wondered around the rock pools, caught a pretty big octopus and named him  wilbert . Haha he escaped a few times n sucked his way over to the water. We had to try n pick him up n put him back in his tub so we cud draw him. Highlight of the day =) we walked over to the other side of the rock pools to observe sum lumps of green jelly in the water. The tide was comin in so we didn't have much time but the view was completely breathtaking. Staring into that huge expanse of blue ocean, with the waves rolling high and white foam hissing away at our feet was my idea of paradise =) it was so serene n peaceful, i could have sat there all day n be completely happy. If i learned nethin today it would be that nature IS beautiful.  I saw soo many amazing things. Have u ever seen a whole flock of birds fly in a V formation? I dunno why but it jus leaves me in awe. That whole idea of team work, with one lone bird at the front taking the hit n reducing the wind drag for others, then swapping around when he gets to tired... ok i sound like a nerd. But it makes u wonder why, if animals do it instinctively, humans find it difficult. Hahaha then agen i also saw a pelican with a fish in its mouth being chased by a flock of seagulls...  Newaiz by lunch time our shoes were completely soaked n full of sand. Lucky we brought spare shoes, which is more than i can say for poor Nita. haha silly gurl... after lunch we had to trek up a huge hill to see a special type of hairy grass. That really pissed me off cuz I was so tired n i'm sure everyone else was too. After another trek back to the bus, we went back to school. I slept the whole way =)  Now I'm at home and sick cuz i got wet, but i swear it was SOOOO worth it! Hrmm i really should get out more often....  Thats all for me =) laters ellagators!!

          Hello all =) I jus got home n I’m completely poooped but in a good way! I had such an exciting weekend so I decided it was worth bloggin about. Today started off as a usual Sunday. I had hockey training nice n early in the mornin. I swear it was soo cold I didn’t wanna wake up. Grade 1 had the entire field to ourselves today. It was mad doing all those crazy drills. Push, dribble, throw, turn, hit, trap, lead, through, deflect, jab, tackle, backtackle!!! Haha it made me so tired. My dad forgot to pick us up because he was playing golf while we had training so we got to watch a first grade uni game. I swear it was so fast n so impressive. They knew exactly wat they were doing n had game plays n everything!! All we have is the tornado, peanut butter and walrus. Walrus is da best tho! We do a fake pass through one of our playas n BAM in da goal. Well that’s wats supposed to happen newaiz. Afta hockey training I had to go straight home cuz we were gonna eat out at yum cha with my family. I had to leave half way (which sux cuz I was hungry!!) cuz I had to meet up with my kloz ncounta buddies at rooty hill at 3. We had an audition to perform in the Miss Teen Philippines pagent. I walked into  martin prinze  on da platform at parra station which was cool cuz I wasn’t a nigel nemore. This dude is da bomb. He jus came to support us n ended up dancing cuz we were missing richard.  Karen  looked like a million bucks all dressed up in her heels and bling bling and  martin c  got a haircut which looks very sexy indeed =) jus thought I might mention that. Oh n  richie , the bumhole, lost the beanie that I made for him n now he wants another one -_- well buy me wool n I will! We got rides off sum very nice people to da venue. Haha well that’s a whole different story in itself… we were somewhere in da middle of rooty hill, dancing on a large slab of concrete with a main road just metres away. What kinda audition is this? That’s wat we were all asking ourselves. Oh n the ground was dirrrty… I sound like da biggest priss in the world rite now but trust me, even the boys didn’t wanna get down… We had a really quick run through n then performed as best as we possibly could. Honestly it was the most underpracticed performance yet n we thought we made fools outa ourselves but guess wat?! WE GOT IN!! dunno how that happened but its allll goot =) Go us! Then I went to parra with  joanne  for a bit. Poor girl, her parents forgot all bout her n she didn’t know how to get home plus she forgot her wallet!! so we had sum food n then sat at da bus stops talkin. Hahaha JOMER!!! Rofl… newaiz my bus came eventually n she was gonna get picked up so I jus went home. Now I’m sittin here typing =) On a sadder note we lost our hockey game this Saturday =( 3nil. Its ok cuz we got a second chance to be in the grand finals cuz we’re coming second in the ladder. We’ll kick butt next week, yeh? That’s why we’re training so hard… hrmm I took a few fotos so I mite put them up. Thanks  darius  for watching! Ur not very vocal but I’m sure u were cheering for us internally =)  That’s all from me for today! Laterz aligatorz…. - Luv ella
