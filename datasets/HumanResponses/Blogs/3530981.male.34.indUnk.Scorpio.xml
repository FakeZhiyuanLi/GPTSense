      I just finished reading Steve Martin's "Shopgirl". I didn't like it as much as his newest book "The Pleasure of My Company" but it won me over by the end. The thing that bothered me in the begining was the very prim, kind of pompous, New Yorker magazine style narrative voice. It was like clinical observation at first and it took me about half the book before I was emotionally involved in the characters. But I finally did and Steve has such a gift for unforced happy endings that you can't  fault him for the slow start.   Couldn't find anything new at the library. I don't know about other places but the library here sucks. It's ok if you're looking for chick-lit books or John Grisham type thrillers but don't ask for anything more. Everything I want they either don't have or has a five year waiting list.  I have no fucking idea who's checking out the good stuff because nobody reads books anymore. Everytime I'm at the library all I see are people surfing the internet and checking out videos and dvds.  It's easier to just pick up books used on half.com or amazon where you can usually get them for a couple dollars plus shipping. I just ordered Nick Hornby's "How To Be Good", Neal Stephenson's "Snow Crash" and Dave Eggers "You Shall Know Your Own Velocity". All of which I wouldn't  have a chance in hell of finding at the library.

      My cousin got pistol whipped the other day. He went into a bar with some friends and there's this crackhead in there with a bullet-proof vest on waving a gun around trying to rob people. He had some guy cornered with the gun in his face screaming at him and then all the sudden turned his attention to my cousin. He cracked him in the head with the gun  and when he had him on the ground started kicking him in the ribs. At this point the other guy who he was pointing the gun at  before high tails it out of the bar and when the  crackhead see him he takes off after him shooting.   My cousin was ok, but he had to stick for about 3-4 hours afterward dealing with the cops, answering questions. Plus his friends ditched him when the fuzz arrived because they were all loaded. It was like "Here's cab fare dude, we gotta split". We were laughing about it today. Life is interesting sometimes.

      Came across this quote from writer Jamie Rich's blog  "People have expressed a lot of sentiments to me lately, regarding the alleged bravery of my striking out to write. Several have noted their own desire to do the same, but not sure if they can or should. I know of at least one person older than me lamenting that his film career has yet to zoom forth. And all I can think is it took one of the most renowned filmmakers of all time nine years to finally strike gold, so is a year or two more than expected really so long? I also recall being a young editor at Dark Horse, annoyed that Paul Pope was already producing amazing work at a tender young age, and Bob Schreck wisely said not to worry about it, we all work at our own pace.  And it's true. Sometimes you just have to wait until the stars align. The real challenge is to make sure you actually recognize that they have when they do. That's what ultimately separates the art from the pose."  The above is so true as I'm gradually starting to realize myself. When I was younger I was both enamored and intimidated by wunderkind's and as a result subconsciously believed I wasn't good enough because I wasn't already a success by age twentysomething. The truth is I wasn't ready back then. I'm ready now. I realize now that it's not about "making it", even though I want to be successfull, it's about doing it for the pure love of the art and being willing to jump off that cliff everyday into new artistic territory. Writing is not easy for me, it's fucking hard work, but the more I do it the more fullfilling it becomes and I get a buzz off of it that's better than any intoxicant I've ever ingested.  I can't ignore the creative voice within me any longer. I look up now and the stars are aligned.

      I've recently fallen in love with XTC again after not really listening to them for a couple of years. They along with The Smiths were the seminal bands that converted me from teenaged metalhead to a more eclectic and cultured musical explorer as I entered college.  XTC have yet to release a dud in their 20 plus years as a band but Skylarking in truly their masterpiece and one of my favorite albums ever. It has a loose "concept" of the seasons as a metaphor for life that was, according to their bio, foisted on them by producer Todd Rundgren but damn it works making this their most seemless record. This would definately be among my dozen dessert island discs. Skylarking and The Queen Is Dead were basically the only 2 albums I listened to for about 3 years in my early 20's.   Saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with my son Nathan this weekend. Alphonso Cuaron definately gave the film a more organic look and it was  beautifully directed but something was missing for me this time around after having adored the first two Harry Potter movies. The sense of wonder was gone. There wasn't as much magic if you can believe that. In streamlining the script to the essential plot they excised the wonderful world of Hogwarts which I think is an essential component. Many characters are reduced to mere cameos. Don't get me wrong it was good, but I think the law of diminishing returns is begining to set in as the books get more complex. Still, Nathan declared it the "best movie ever" which is all that matters.   The Complete Pee Wee's Playhouse is coming out on DVD this fall.  If that doesn't make you love the DVD format I don't know what will.  I don't care what anyone says Paul Reubens/Pee Wee Herman is a genius. Now if only they'd put out the original HBO special. C'mon DVD makers don't be a Mr. Bungle.

      Sitting here with 2 more hours to go at work. Feeling a bit wiped, definately have the Fridayitis. Also feeling a bit haunted tonight. Ghosts from my past seem to be popping up with alarming frequency. It all started when I played a cd that I haven't listened to in awhile (XTC's Oranges & Lemons) and I realized that an old former friend of mine had absconded with a few of my other XTC cd's. That plus a couple other reminders of former friends and flames just drove home how people come into your life and out just as quickly. I guess I need to accept the fluidity of  existence but I just get stuck on how wrong it seems that certain people can be such a big part of your life one moment and be nothing more than a lingering memory the next. I wonder if it's as hard for others as it is for me? I've known plenty of people that seemingly had no trouble leaving me behind and never looking back. I think I'm particularly empathic in that I listen to a song from a certain time or see memento and instantly get time warped back to whatever emotional state I was in then. I know it's not a good idea to revisit the past but I have a morbid curiousity about what people I don't talk to or see anymore are doing now. Nothing good can come of acting on it as I can attest to from experience but you want to think you had some sort of impact on the people in your life. Maybe it's just an ego thing for me, but I want to whole George Bailey montage of how miserable things are without me but it never works out that way. People just move on.  I'm also particularly upset that Lollapalooza is not coming to Florida. The closest city is Atlanta. I'm so tempted, Morrissey is the only member of the Holy Musical Trinity I haven't seen,  but I just don't have the money for a trip like that right now. Plus, there's always at least a 50/50 chance with Moz that he's going to cancel. It would suck to put up all that effort and money for nothing. Still I want I want go soooo bad. Morrissey and The Flaming Lips are two of my absolute favorites.

      Doing this I'm just now realizing how they came up with the name Dashboard Confessional. I'm so behind the times. I kind of feel like a bandwagon jumper doing this blog, but I will admit that the chance of someone actually reading and responding to this does have its appeal. There's a hint of danger to it, especially when one of my biggest fears is having nothing interesting to say. However, if I remain silent it becomes a self fullfilling prophecy. Hell, I gotta be more interesting than most of the navel gazers out there. So welcome to my  warped world. Hopefully I can entrall you with devestating wit, impeccable taste, and facinatingly insightful inner musings.
