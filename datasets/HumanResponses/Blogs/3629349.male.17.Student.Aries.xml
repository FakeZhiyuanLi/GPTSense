      wooHooo~~ first day of sch in SP~~ my mood was damn gd today when i woke up!! pretty excited...but was really disappointed with SP in terms of their planning and management lvl of running the sch...etc. 1 unexpected matter was dat i was changed from 1A03 to 1A02 class w/o notifying me.haiz...now my timetable is so %^$%$^%..why??~~ 03 timetable had earlier dismissals, and compared with it to 02, which only had a day of early dismissal.... and their games...wasn't very nice~~i think it's probably due to my class mates...they gave up even b4 trying!!and they wanted the forfeits.....i was feeling so JACK when i saw them saying all those stuff...perhaps i'm too en2? Overall, the new friends i made were pretty friendly lah...not bad...looking forward for more fun with them.and guess what?i was so blur during the class games ...like wacko~i got so blur after when i was caught more than 3 times...aiyoz...why i so weak... :X

      hmmm...forgot to blog yesterday...so now i'm adding some info on it.Went to carrefour HR to collect my OT pay with tanghoe and alvin.well, didn't manage to receive the pay cause the woman in charge has forgotton abt it....so got to wait till friday for her news. went "shopping" around suntec area.., supposingly to accompany tanghoe to shop...but he didn't buy any shoes not clothings.haha....instead he spent $18 on some "tikum" keychains.He wanted to get a pirate ship(1 piece cartoon), but he couldn't.hehe...bad luck huh?:P..as for me...i got the gundam character which i wanted in 1 TRY~~haha..thx to tanghoe for helping me....  :) and...we went down to bishan cc to play bball....first game with braddell westlake pple, and we won lah.2nd match with the "old birds" there, was a sure lose match.Their skills and speed is far too much better....and i'm very pek chek with my skills.Firstly, i can't shoot .All my shots hit the rim and bounced back.Or it's a airball(haiz...sad case).But i did a very nice lay-up from the baseline and managed to contribute something....

      something i can be proud of today~~managed to woke up early today without alarm clock nor my parent's wake up call~~went to play bball...and guess what?~~the guy dat's always late was the first there today~~haha...as usual, very angry with myself for making mistakes and bit performing.Guess i really need intensive bball training(alone) and gym visits.1 more thing~~went to watch "The BEst Bet" with my whole family~ can't believe my dad came along, cause i have never gone out with him to the mall for like 7 yrs~~happy but tiring day...  and i had a weird dream this morning....haha...i have tanghoe quarrelling with some opponent on the bball court.Then i intercepted to help tanghoe...den got whacked up by the gang...kaoz...what kind of dream was dat...~~~  :P

      erhm...this is for yesterday which i didn't have the chance to blog.yup....sunday was the last day of my grandpa's wake...i stay overnight at the wake, and waited for the rituals to start.Well, we sent him off to cremate..den we went to the temple to get ready for his urn and place in the temple.Temple's name was Wan Fuo Lin , somewhere near CHaiChee.Glad it was not some hill at the north side cause i could just take a train to the place.After dat, i went home to rest until 245pm.Then i returned to collect his ashes, then back to the temple again to put the ashes into the urn.yup...dat's how my day ended....not in a gd mood to write, probably go play bball to relieve stress...

      yup, today is the first day of my grandpa's wake.Got down to SIngapore Casket around 5 plus...ya...saw his body lying there in the coffin.I almost cried, but i stopped myself.No point crying infront of my grandpa.Well, spent the rest of the day burning joss paper and sticks for him.AT least this is something which i can do for him before i can't really c him again in real life.SO i kept burning those things for him, from 5pm to 11pm plus, with some water-breaks inbetween.got myself some burns in the process. i'm not trying to be superstitious, but the elders of the family said the more things you do for him, you would have greater bless from him too.oF cour3e i didn't really believed in dat, but i'm really sincerely wishing my grandpa to have a peaceful rest in h3aven~

      erhmm...this is my first time posting abt me on my blog,so still not very used to it. ok...basically, today was not a very happy day.My grandpa passed away peacefully in SGH around 7:35pm .Strange, i did not drop a single tear for him.Instead, i was happy for him.WHy?This ended his suffering for him.Perhaps you might not know, he could not talk,see,hear for the past 1 week.Everyday for him was just purely sighing from him in pain.I cried whenever i visit him, but not today.Yup,dat's abt it today...getting sleepy..*yAwNz

      looked forward to this day, but it wasn't as gd as i expected..... went out with this 3 classmates lor, supposingly trying to bring me togther with this ger lah....or i should say, know her better.Dun think it was successful bah...well...i guess i was too tired to talk or make a fool out of myself. 1/2 way through the outing, i got mood swing again.Haiz...just so sudden, and uncontrollable.I couldn't figure out the actual reason, but i guess i could be jealous, or i was thinking abt the 4SE gang.Toking abt 4SE gang, i just ordered the jerseys!guess what?darren told me milton is not getting the jersey anymore cause he has no money.Seriously,i got pretty pissed off by his reason .Come on, it's for our friendship, not for someo strangers.What brothers forever....more like fuckers....  Thinking on the train home after i sent that ger home.....must a gurl and a guy be always be lovers and not friends?i did asked myself this some time ago, but i didn't think much into it....   topics which went thru my head today -i missed bball~ -i missed 4SE days~ -i missed NCC days~ -the one whom i actually like now -working hard for my results -love commitments -most guys are really &!&amp;$$##!!^%^, what else could they do beside flirting? -i can't stand gers who think dat they are at a higher class den other gers, and they are damn chio. -meaning of friendship.....  got to know myself better again.... i'm totally emotional....and i'm....easily jealous..and...i'm weak in maintaining relationships....but, i'm willing to sacrifice anything for friends/family for the sake of them....i can't understand why money is placed above relationships in many pple now....*sighz...the world is getting dimmer...  ask myself again .....am i the only one still waiting for the grp to come back...?~!!!

      things aren't going smoothly for me....not really used to poly life yet....maybe i can't get rid of my sec sch habits.....well...at least it's better since the start of poly... ^^...i have some cool classmates to make my day better!!  haiz....haven't really get down to serious studying....wasting lots of time doing unneccessary stuff... thinking to give up bball for my fish hobby....which i'm not very sure abt this decison...  life..has ups and downs, but there are times which we need to give things up....including pple.....why pple?friends come and go....you might be missing him/her, but would they do the same to you?dun know why i'm thinking of such selfish logics....i'm never like this b4... i once mentioned this to my friend....if i ever died one day, would he weep for me?well...he asked me not to ask such silly questions..... the actual fact i want to know...how many friends i have will actually do dat? i remembered how i lost Norwyn during April's Fool last yr...i cried days for him... i'm still missing his smiles....the great times we had togther...he's a great friend!  and i also dream....playing on the bball court...with my best friends i could ever find thus far as a team, against other pple...showing great teamwork and trust....yet, this day has not come.....maybe i'm pondering upon something which would never happen...or everyone has left this dream,leaving me, the only one behind....  haha....from what i wrote here....i c myself as a emotional person.One who can't let go of things easily...and i tend to live with such burdens....you can say i'm naive too...

       writing this straight after i reached home...............   something i must decide once and for all.....   i think i should leave the grp,&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;someone told me yesterday, "friends come and go "....which i find it very true.   I can't forget the memories dat the grp had, but i know i must forget this and carry on.   This is becoming a burden to me, not something which encourages me.It's just pulling me back...far too many times....   And, my classmates are pretty cool guys....tot they were just hi bye friends, but their characters are far much better den those in the grps....they give me the feel of respect, and the feeling which i have known them for yrs.....perhaps, i was fated to meet them for a purpose?....perhaps perhaps....life's full of surprises, isn't it?    &nbsp;  i have a much different view on pple now....SERIOUSLY, looks dun matter at all to me now......it's the characters....   so pple may look normal or ugly...but they have very gd characters.....and they make gd friends...so dun judge a book by it's cover...   and singaporean gals....most of them are so materialistic...so difficult to find one who really likes you because of your characters , and not your money,looks...etc   still looking for the one..................maybe it's not time yet....

      hmm...went out with my bro and his friends..went fish hunting...got myself a new strain "coral red" with metal genes...the female gave birth while on the way home~haha...i expected it, from my decade plus of experience...this is so easy to spot one~ btw, i only bought the female ...a pair is at $30, i bought the female at $15.haha...a way to save money, cause the female was hit by the male already, so in a way i dun need the male anymore.Then went pasir ris park to makan dinner, hmm...food there isn't expensive...quite tasty also..maybe next time i jio my friends go also...  and..from the way most of the guys in poly behave infront of gals, they are definitely so different when they are with their male friends.well, they have to act just to please the gals?~~for goddness sake, can't you guys ever wake up?can't you guys be yourself?at least i am...i dun give a damn how the gers look at me, i just want to be comfortable and be myself.I dun go around gers watching, spotting which are the pretty ones and then ask for their nos...i find it...so disgusting...is it the looks dat are so important? for me,CHaracters come first man.I hate gers who think dat they are damn chio(when they are not) .....or those who are super teh...or super bhb..or those who uses profanities...joking around is fine, but not overboard...

      erhmmz....it's a sat today...didn't do much today...woke up at 12pm...i was too tired after playing bball for hrs at SP.parts of my body were still aching when i woke up..but i went to PPCC to play bball(aGaIn)...saw 1 pro which i really admired...3 pt shooter who hardly miss...ya...dat's not all.HE can HANG like NOBODY's business...and fake away jump shots with like 80% accuracy...and it's from baseline~~damn pro...i really pei fu... as for me, didn't do well lah....i had gd postures but lousy finish...only score a few...den meet some juniors from SAS...wah...they damn pro liao...maybe i long time never play~~damn tired...played like 4 hrs there today...  haiz...why i'm i still thinking of melissa?did i play bball there just to try my luck if i can meet her again?or i was always trying to meet her at the court again...hoping her shots would rebounced and hit my head again...  or the feeling for claudia is just a moment...i feel dat she's not the one for me... confused....

      woohoo~~a week at poly...too many things to do, yet not enough time... is time running out for me?perhaps it's everyone as we get older day by day.Making commitments towards relationships is probably the toughest thing i can ever handle.For friends, for family....it's never enough for me.If i'm given a wish,i just want some more time. and...played bball from 2pm to 6pm...it was tiring yet satisfactory.FInally, i understand what the teachers have been preaching in sch...never never rest on your laurels.WHy?there's always someone better than you out there in this world.Always hone on your skills... yeah....and...something i thought abt as i walked home from the mrt station.Although it was just a 5 mins walk, i found something we as humans should do.Always stretch out your helping hand to someone, even to someone you dun know.Yup, maybe dat's why i joined CSCC....to handle things in a calmer way, and learn to be observant and care for others. It's high time for me study hard, coz i'm running out of time...

      second day of poly...pretty fun...i enjoyed most of the lessons except ITOS...it's abit com hardware and software...the teacher made it boring, but she's a nice lady...haha. breaks inbetween lessons.got to know this cute ger in my class, name is claudia i think...haha...but she's so cUtEE~~~heard her using some %^&%&^ to jerome outside lecture hall i think...but she said she didn't(???)...haha...i will try to know her better first...to me, character is more important den anything.   ....muhahaha.....hey..this does not mean i'm forgetting melissa ok.... :X   and just stoned and think thru some stuff.......friends...who are they?for company?for laughters?or when we need help?well...i think they are more than dat...they know you inside out, and remind you when you making mistakes.When i mean understand you, they are predict your actions when handling matters.  and friends are like plants, they need water,sunlight and minerals.And we as friends, we give each other these.Sunlight is laughter, water is help/company and minerals are the silly and stupid things we do together.Plants without sunlight,water,minerals will withered in no time.THis happened to me and yongxiang recently.Perhaps it was time tken by his gf bah.I'm never gd in relationships, as i have made many plants withered in my life.Of course i regretted not spending more time with them....  well maintained plants would eventually bloomed with flowers...i hope i could make as many flowers bloom beside me....

      erhm....suddenly these thoughts came to my mind....abt friends in life. Friends...i classified them in 2 grps.Casual and close.CLose are the ones whom you can be friends for the life time, always doing the little things for each other.Casual are just the ones you can hang out with when you are lonely.You dun really know how's the character of casual friends.But close friends(brothers), really understand you well.even though we bickers and have some misunderstandings, we are together again after we are cooled down.Well...one can make lots of friends, but a brother is for a lifetime,casual friends are just for a moment.  my bRothERs lisTS                   1)bendy                            2)tanghoe 3)alvin 4)enoch 5)zhicong  the one-->melisSa

      managed to experience poly life for the past few days....could feel that friends aren't easy to make.I mean friends dat are really going to be close.Casual friends are easy to make, but definitely not close ones. back to business, played some games, listened to some talks..learned how to logged on to sch's webby...and bball everyday after sch...until 630pm~~woohoo...i'm so shagged for the past few days....haha...but enjoying... sad thing is...i've been changed to class 03 to 02...haiz...missed the class man..

      mind is very focused today.....seems that i'm able to keep my mood serious for the day..... at least, i'm trying to concentrate on my work now, unlike these past weeks which i'm always distracted by someone.........  fuLL of vigor with bball~.....waiting for that day to come so badly....  noone in this world can comment anything on my actions....cause noone has the position to reprimand me.3ven me myself dun give comments....why do strangers bother so much.....

            hmm....guess i'm finally settled down after 5 weeks in poly....(not getting myself entangled in love life), deciding what i actually want for myself.I always ask others, but not really thought it over for myself. What i want is very simple, i hust wanna do whatever i like(w/o the expense of other's happiness), and stay happy.       Friends, family, my fishes, bball are my today priorities now.Love life now, i will not do anything at the moment.and i kinda hate some gers.They just take the guys for granted.We are not born to be ordered around by you, nor born just to entertain you and doing silly stuff which we look like stupid silly morons.Well, i have had enough.All these nonsense shall ceased.Unless it's my close friends and my loved ones, i won't do any other nonsensical thing.This sounds so mean and sensitive, but i just need to set a standard for myself.      I'm getting far too ill disciplined this days, i need to really get myself more organised.....i shall see, as actions speak louder than words.bball....is still my love....nor i will give up things that i like....mY fiShiEs!~and friends...never give up hopes in them.... if tanghoe you are reading this......i didn't give up our friendship nor 4SE.....bRoTH3rS foRevEr~!

      it's me again........having some thoughts right now............ dun really know the reason why i'm thinking all this..... there's time for everything under the heaven, and there's time to be serious , and time to play. Like the sch motto, " Up and On ", and play like you never play b4, study like you never study b4........Thinking abt myself, i really go wild when i play....and very serious when i'm in the mood, and i dun joke around at all, nor do i laugh abt anything.........perhaps, i'm trained to do so.....
