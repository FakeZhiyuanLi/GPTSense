      It feels like its been a long day, although it really wasn't.  Sis came back from her GRE classes at around 1.  We ordered a pizza and some chicken fingers and decided to sit back and watch a movie at home.  It was too hot in Chennai to step out.  We picked a movie titled "Something's Gotta Give" starring Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand.  The movie started off as being boring but started to get better as it went along.  Sis decided to get some sleep while the movie was still on and stretched out in the living room itself. I watched the complete movie and then we decided to have some hot tea and then get dressed to go out.  We visited a couple of temples on the outskirts of the city.  For the first time in my life, when I stood in front of God, I felt truly humbled.  My experiences the last 10 months have made me realise that everyone is vulnerable and sometimes, situations and circumstances can humble almost anyone....and no one is invincible.  For the first time in my life, I realised that happiness can be stolen away in one swift stroke of fate and you can be helpless and only hoping for things to get better.    I am too tired to talk about what I am thinking right now.  Its already 11PM and I need to get up early and set out to Blore.  Its going to be another 7 hour drive and I need to get back as early as possible.  So, I'd better sign out now and hope that tomorrow is as good and as enlightening as today.

      Folks,  When I set out to Chennai this weekend, I thought I would have something really nice to write about.  This was a trip that I'd planned for months on, and when it materialised, I was thrilled as hell.  I took Friday off (rather worked from home) just so that I could go to my parents' place, pick up things that my mom wanted to give my sis, then set out to see Ricky.  She wanted to buy my sis a book, and I thought it was a wonderful gesture, besides it was an opportunity for me to see her as well.  So, despite her office being virtually in the opposite direction, I drove all the way to see her.  She picked up something very thoughtful and nice and I was positive that my sis would be delighted.    I think I had a fight with Ricky when I was with her (I dont even remember now).  I think we did have a fight because when I headed out home, I decided to go to the hairdresser although Ricky wanted me to grow my hair so that she could take me to a hair sylist.  She thinks my hairstyle is horrid and that there is no syle to it.  So, she's been wanting me to grow my hair and she would take me to this sylist that she visited recently.  Anyways, I wanted to defy her and therefore got my hair chopped short as always.  I then drove to the gas station and filled my fuel tank to the brim.  It had 5 litres of petrol already and I ended up filling up another 25 litres, and it cost me a thousand bucks.  Made sure that my tyres had enough air and I drove back home, all excited about the early morning start that I had planned.  Ricky was on the phone with me for an hour or so that night, talking to me about what I should do during the trip and basically being with me during my times of excitement.  I must acknowledge that it must've been awfully difficult for her to talk while her husband was at home but she did manage to spend time with me on the phone.  I asked her if she would give me a wake up call in the morning at 4.  She said she would love to, but was worried that she might not wake up in time to call me and that I would be ticked off because of that.  That spun off into a relatively small fight (some of our fights are big, hurtful and therefore this sounded relatively small).  Despite the fight, she promised to do her best to wake up in the morning and give me a call.    I didn't want to take chances and therefore I kept a wakeup call for myself, woke up by 3.45 itself and got busy getting ready.  4AM went by and so did 4.30 and there was no call from her.  I knew I was going to get pissed and I was fighting my emotions really hard.  I didn't want to ruin the trip and definitely didn't want to spend the next 6 hours, driving in a foul mood.  I'd been planning this trip for months and when it was eventually happening, I didn't want to be pissed.  I love driving my car and I knew that the Blore-Chennai road would be awesome.  So, I pretended like nothing had happened (actually nothing had happened and that was the whole issue.  She hadn't called!!) and went about getting ready.  I finally managed to get out of the house by 4.50AM and I sent her an sms saying that I was setting out now.  I drove to the nearby Citibank ATM, withdrew lots of money and set out from the ATM by 5.05AM.  I took note of the reading on the car, decided to make notes while on the way, and use those notes to update my blog later on.  I have those notes lying in the car right now and I am too lazy to go pick it up.  So, I am going to let this blog be a free flowing one, free of all data points :-)  The weather was pleasant in Blore when I started off, the roads were empty (which is a rare thing in Blore these days), and within a few minutes, my bad mood lifted off and I started to enjoy my driving.  I drove thru J'nagar 4th block, then onto Ashoka Pillar, hit Double Road, then drove past MG Rd, and then finally got onto Old Madras Road.  I started to wonder why it was still called "Old Madras Road" considering that people take this road to get to Chennai.  I started to get a nagging feeling that I might be on the wrong road, and finally couldn't resist the tempatation of waking up Naveen to confirm.  I called him at 5.30 I guess and he mumbled a "hullo" in his sleep.  I asked him if this was the right road, he started to say something but the line got cut.  I waited for him to call back but he didn't.  I figured I shouldn't disturb him once more and decided to continue on the same road.  I prayed a little prayer in my head, hoping that my trip wouldn't be ruined for such a silly reason.  By 5.45AM, the sun started to rise and it was bright enough for me to switch off my headlights.  I noticed that the oncoming vehicles started to switch off their headlights too and that was a big relief for me.  Lights glaring into your eye when you are driving can be very difficult to deal with.  By six, I knew I was really enjoying the drive, I started to increase my speed and was hitting 100 kmph regularly and for good distances.  I was making quick progress and I was beginning to love the feel of the car.  The way it took the curves at that speed was awesome.  I started to think it was the right time to switch on music, so I chose to listen to Yuva.  Yuva is Mani Ratnam's latest movie and the music is composed by AR Rahman.  I can bet on Rahman to belt out amazing music anyday of the year.  So, I started to listen to those numbers and I thought the first two songs were average and then the music started to get worse.  I figured listening to his tunes the first time always feels this way, so I promised to listen to them a few more times to see if I start liking them.  But when I got to the last track (the 6th one), I was in for a pleasant surprise.  This song was titled "Fanaa" and wow, was it good!  It was so catchy that I must've listened to it atleast 5-6 times over and over again and then I started to like the first two songs too...although not as much as the last one.  I dont know what Fanaa means but wow, was that song good!  I was beginning to move my head in tune with the music and I started to clap along with the rhythm of the song.  I realised that I'd been listening to the songs so many times that it was already 8.30AM.  I glanced at my cell to see if there were any missed calls or if there was an sms.  The music was so loud in the car that it was quite possible that I might not have heard the cellphone ring.  But to my dismay, there were none --- no missed calls, no sms msgs either.  I tried to brush it off and told myself that I was doing just fine, I was already 3 hours into my drive and having a good time.  I noticed that I'd done almost 200 kms and I started to think that I could actually reach Chennai soon and my sis would keep me occupied enough to not think of Ricky.  I changed the CD and I started to listen to the NOW collection of songs.  The songs were pleasant, not as catchy as Yuva and I guess I wasn't enjoying them as much because I've listened to them before and was refreshingly new like Yuva.  I realised that I'd been driving for nearly 200 minutes and I hadn't taken a single break.  I also realised that I must've driven past Woody's and I'd completely forgotten about it.  I was enjoying my drive that much!  I was to have breakfast at Woody's but I wasn't really hungry, so I didn't mind not stopping there.    I was probably doing a speed of 105 kmph and one of the songs got over and there was a brief silence in the car, and I heard a loud long drawn sound from outside the car.  It didn't sound like an accident or a big thud, but it sounded like there was siren going off from a nearby factory.  I glanced over to my right but there were no buildings around.  Just lots of trees and open fields.  I glanced at the rear-view mirror to see if the sound was coming from a vehicle from behind me but saw none.  There were no vehicles ahead of me either.  For a moment, I was blank.  Then, it struck me that it could be from my car!!!!!!  I quickly turned off my CD player, turned off the AC, slowed down a bit and rolled down my window pane.  And to my sheer luck, I realised that the loud sound was actually louder (now that I'd rolled down my window pane) and it was indeed from my car!  Bloody hell!  My heart almost stopped and for a minute, I imagined being stranded on this deserted highway, with my car broken down and waiting for hours before I could get a mechanic to my car and get it diagonised, let alone get it fixed.  I almost literally saw my weekend Chennai plans go up in smoke.  I switched on my left indicator, pulled over the car to the side of the road, stopped under a tree, turned off the engine and stepped out of the car to see if there was any visible damage to the car (like smoke bellowing from the hood of the car!).  I didn't see anything wrong on the face of it, I decided to take a quick loo break, pee-ed behind the tree, drank some water and walked around the car, as if that would help the car miraculously work.  Not that I could've opened the hood and started to fix the engine either.  Walking around it was probably the only thing I could do.  I looked up and down the road to see if there was help nearby but saw none.  I ambled to the front of the car again, stepped inside with absolutely no hope, turned the engine on and waited for that sound to come again.  It didn't.  I gingerly shifted to first gear, slowly stepped on the peddle and started to slowly move down the road.  No sound yet.  I kept thinking it was only a matter of time before the sound resurfaced, decided that I wouldn't speed and keep moving slowly till I reached a nearby town where I could show my car to a mechanic.  I kept going slowly, slowly started getting more confident and increased the speed to 40kmph.  Still nothing happened.  I kept that speed for the next 15 minutes or so and then I increased the speed to 60kmph.  Still nothing happened.  I rolled up the windown pane, confident that I could keep this speed and reach the nearby town.  Just when a smile started to appear on my face, I heard the same damn sound again and my heart sank.  I once again pulled over to the side of the road, stopped, but didn't switch off the engine.  I waited for about 2 minutes and I started again and there was no sound.  I kept going and going and you wont believe it, but till I reached Chennai, that sound never resurfaced again.  Phew!  I stopped driving at 100kmph but occasionally touched 80kmph but predominantly maintained my speed at 70kmph.  I guess cutting down on speed started to affect my progress and I started to enjoy my drive that much lesser.  Not that I am a speed-freak but having to consciously drive slower is being unnatural.  Other vehicles were beginning to overtake me, the roads were getting better and wider and I had to actually stick to the left lane so that I could let other vehicles overtake me.  I guess I started to think of other things like Ricky, for example, now that I wasn't really kicked about the drive.  I glanced at the cell and found one sms with a timestamp of 9.30 which said "I fell asleep on the sofa, woke up in the morning and went upstairs to sleep.  I woke up again just now.  So, how's the drive been?"  I was very disappointed with that.  I was disappointed that she didn't call and I was disappointed that it was almost 10 and yet, there was no call from her.  Not being able to get up at 4 to give me a wake up call is one thing but not calling me the moment she woke was even more hurtful.  I tried not to reply, tried to think of other things and continuing with the drive but I just couldn't.  I must've battled with my emotions for over 15 minutes (it seemed like 15 hours!), then couldn't help starting to type a reply back.  I wrote her a nasty sms --- I dont want to quote it online, it was that nasty, and waited for a reply.  I must've waited 10 min or so, and then wrote another nasty sms.  I knew this was going to spin off into a fight but I just couldn't help it.  My mood started to get really, really foul and to make matters worse, I got stuck in a traffic jam!  That gave me the time to exchange a series of angry msgs with her and at the end of it, she became defiant as always and told me that I was an insensitive, mean and nasty guy.  I was hurt, yelled at myself in the car, shouted at the top of my voice telling myself to forget her, get over her and move on.  I yelled so hard that my throat started to hurt and tears started to fill up my eyes.  Luckily, no one could've heard me yelling because the window panes were up, the AC was on and so was the music.    I spoke to her a couple of times on the phone but that didn't help either.  I drove on, hoping that my mood would get better but I started to approach the city (Chennai), the traffic started getting thicker, the weather was getting hotter and none of this was helping.  By the time I got to the city, I was frustrated, angry, bitter, helpless and wanted to get away from everything.  I messaged her saying "Reached the outskirts of the city" and she wrote back excitedly, saying that she was really kicked and happy for her, "although I dont like you".  I felt better because she was excited for me and that lifted my spirits a bit.  I stopped several times to enquire how to get to my sister's house and eventually got there.  She had to rush to some meeting which would last an hour and asked me if it was ok for me to be alone for an hour or so.  I was more than happy to be alone, I wanted the time to sort out my mood and be ok enough to have a good time with my sis.  I had driven 7 hours "door to door" and I didn't want to sound grumpy or distracted and in turn disappoint her.  I knew she had to cancel a number of appointments just so that she could spend time with me.  I HAD to sound better, I HAD to feel better.  She left, I had a bath, changed to fresh clothes and stretched out on the bed.  I must've fallen asleep in seconds and when I woke up, it was 3.30 and I found sister lying down on the carpet in the living room, catching up on sleep herself.  She woke up and we started to talk.  I found a bean bag to sit on and surprisingly enough, found it every comfy.  The bean bag at Ricky's place didn't excite me too much when I was at her place.  Anyways, we started to talk and soon enough, I was telling her about the sorry state that I was in and the difficulties I was facing.  She was supportive as always, told me to give it time, give it my honest best and if I was destined to get Ricky, I would.  She never said even one thing negative about Ricky but only told me that I was entitled to feel jealous or possessive, entitled to be disappointed if she didn't call you at 4, entitled to get angry if she decided to spend time with her husband.  She fully understood my feelings but never a word like "what Ricky is doing to you is wrong", or "I wish Ricky wouldn't be so thoughtless" or "Ricky is mean".  None of that.  I was really touched.    Anyways, we got dressed and decided to drive down to Fisherman's Cove.  The traffic was horrid in the beginning but as we got to the outskirts of the city, it started to get darker, the traffic thinned down and the drive become more enjoyable.  I glanced at the meter and noticed that I'd done nearly 425 kms the same day and wondered how I could still enjoy driving.  Anyways, sis started to tell me about what she was going thru.  I can't put all of that online but when she finished telling her story, I was shattered.  I felt horrid and felt that God was being mean and cruel.  A couple of times, I started to think that I would start crying but fought back my tears and appeared to be supportive just like how she is when I confide in her.  I was really touched to see that my sis was confiding in me but her story made me feel so sad.  I was lost for words and couldn't manage to say anything sensible.  I decided I wouldn't advice her unless I knew what I was talking about, so I just nodded my head most times and listened to her.  I guess she was happy with just that, and she spoke for hours.  I must confess that last night was one of the most depressing nights of my life.  The whole world seemed so cruel and mean.  I started to think of ways to help her but I couldn't think of any.  If the problem was to do with money or something material, I could always help her.  I could give her money, buy her a house or whatever.  But what she was going thru was something that I couldn't help.  I could at best extend a shoulder for her to lean on.  I was mortified and by the end of dinner, I was feeling sick and asked her if we could go home.  She apologised for ruining my evening but I insisted that the evening wasn't really "ruined" but I was feeling bad for her and feeling helpless.  We drove back in silence and stopped on the way to have a fruit juice.  The place was classy and it was a drive-in thing.  So, we sat in the darkness of my car and sipped on our juice.  I had a Mango-Banana smoothie and she had something that I can't seemed to recollect.  We then drove back home, talked for a while and eventually went to sleep at around midnight.  I lay awake on my bed for nearly 2 hours, thinking of all the things that my sis said the evening earlier and felt worse.  I messaged Ricky asking her if she was awake and if we could speak.  Not that I wanted to tell about what my sis was going thru but I just wanted to be comforted and I wanted to speak to her real bad.  I waited for a response and got none.  I realised that her last sms was at around 9 PM and she hadn't even bothered to wish me good night.  I wondered if she was having a nice time with Arjun and she completely forgot about me.  It made me feel pukish and I even contemplated going over to the bathroom.  I then fought my feelings (as always), tried telling myself that she must've fallen asleep --- it sounded so cliched and I knew she wouldn't tell me anything different the next morning but I had nothing better to tell and comfort myself.  It took a while but I eventually fell asleep.  I think this is the most horrid feeling in the world and I pray God that no one...absolutely no one, not even the worst of my enemies, has to go thru this.  Its so sickening that its hard to describe by words.  Horrid!  Horrid!  Horrid!  We woke up late this morning.  She's gone to take GRE classes and should be back in an hour's time.  I thought I'd get online and send a mail to my bosses, letting them know that I would not be coming to work tomorrow either.  I have no enthusiasm left in me, I go thru the motions because I must get on with life but I find life to be so meaningless without Ricky.  Its so painful that it actually hurts deep inside.  When I got online, I found her online on Yahoo and I was thrilled for a brief moment.  She told me that she got online to get download some receipies.  I realised she was probably having a good time with Arjun, cooking for him and enjoying the weekend together.  I asked her if she was cooking for him and she came up with something lame about "trying to get to the kitchen" but it sounded so lame and shallow that I didn't want to believe her.  I hate myself for having to put up with all this.  I hate myself so much....

      Sony co-founder and chairman Akio Morita was a legendary workaholic. "The best way to describe Morita's extraordinary drive," the consultant Kenichi Ohmae once remarked, "is to scan his schedule for the two-month period immediately preceding his stroke [while playing tennis at 72]. He took trips from his home base in Tokyo to New Jersey, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Dallas, Britain, Barcelona and Paris. During that time he met with Queen Elizabeth II, General Electric chief Jack Welch, future French President Jacques Chirac, Isaac Stern and many other politicians, bureaucrats and business associates. He attended two concerts and a movie; took four trips within Japan; appeared at eight receptions; played nine rounds of golf; was guest of honor at a wedding ceremony; and went to work as usual for 17 days at Sony headquarters. Morita's schedule had been decided on more than a year in advance."  [In his 60s Morita took up wind surfing and scuba diving and started skiing to ensure good exercise through the winter.]  Morita, Akio (1921-1999) Japanese executive, co-founder and chairman of Sony (until 1994) [noted for his role in the development of such revolutionary products as the transistor radio (1957), the VCR, and the Sony walkman]

      I've been desperately trying to clear up all my work and ensure a hassle-free weekend but my laptop has other plans.  Everytime I open a Word document, the system hangs, and makes me have to reboot all over again.  There's this annoying contract document that I need to review and send it out to the customer but I just can't seem to get it done with.  Besides, I have over 80 more unread emails --- in other words, lots of work.    I am looking forward to this evening because I am going out.  I am looking forward to leaving as early as possible so that I can scuttle "someone's" plans of going to the airport...hehehe...wicked me :-)  More later...let me try making my system work atleast now.  If I can't, I am gonna log a helpline call.

      I didn't title this blog as "My weekend trip..." or "My roadtrip..." or any such thing because this trip was really meant to be a get-away....I needed it real bad.  And by the way, this trip wasn't on a weekend either -- it was bang in the middle of a week, with work left waiting to be attended to later on.  The need for the get-away was that bad.  Its not been much of a get-away so far though.  I've been pretty much on the phone all evening with Ricky and all morning too!  Its close to noon now and I am sitting in this quaint Sify Iway internet parlour, chatting on Yahoo with Ricky and updating my blog.  I have my laptop with me and would've loved to log on from my room at the resort and surfed the net but they don't have broadband connection and they charge Rs 5 for 180 seconds of dialup time!!  That makes it Rs 200 per hour and as expensive as it would be at the Taj.  Not that this place is any less classier --- I didn't realise that this resort belonged to the Ashok group untill I actually checked in and looked at their logo on the Menu Card in the room.  I did notice their name on the Indiamart site when I checked for beach resorts at Pondy but just like most net users do, I picked the top 2 hits -- the Kailash Beach Resort and the St James Beach Resort.  I found the St James Resort to be a lot less expensive at Rs 1000 per night for single occupancy (Yes, single occupancy because I went alone!!! -- more about this later) and Kailash was twice as expensive at Rs 2100 per night.  I am usually not that finnicky about the price but on this trip, I decided to watch my spending because this trip was meant to be dedicated for sulking and I didn't think sulking required as much spending (yes, i meant "sulking" with an "l'.....so, stop thinking dirty now!).  The drive to Pondy was different from the one to Chennai in a lot of ways.  Although I was doing another 250 miles all by myself, the similarity ended there.  Folks, by the way, 250 miles on Indian roads is a lot of driving, given the condition of the roads -- although the condition of the roads on both these trips was simply brilliant.  I was initially thinking about taking the same Old Madras Road and kept thinking that there would be a deviation for Pondy, pretty much like the deviation for Tirupati somewhere along the way.  On the last day at work just before leaving, I wrote a mail to the Yahoo Group, comprising of other residents in my apartment building and asked them if anyone had done a recent trip to Pondy and if they had any suggestions for me.  One guy wrote back saying that they stayed at the Karnataka Guest House or some such thing...talked about places to see at Pondy, such as the Auroville and finally while signing off, like almost as if it was an after-thought, mentioned that Hosur Road was a pleasure to drive on!!  Hosur Road??!!??  I knew Hosur Road led to Chennai too and therefore to Pondy as well, but I had this impression that Hosur Road was the route people "used" to take but not anymore.  I put that thought away during the day and thankfully, in the evening, Chandru called me.  I was telling him about my trip and asked him which way to take.  Chandru has done his share of road trips in the past and I figured that he might know.  He suggested that I take the Hosur Road too, and that pretty much sealed the case for me.  Talking about dissimilarities between this trip and the Chennai trip, the first one started bang in the morning.  I didn't start as early as 5AM for this drive but instead started at 7.38AM (dont' get flabbergasted with my memory....I am referring to my notes as I reel out the next few pieces of statistics).  My new servant maid came in the morning and I gave away all the left over food to her --- signs of me becoming more domesticated ;-)  Whoever is going to be my future girlfriend or wife should be pleased to read this.  And hey Ricky, don't start getting panicky....I am not suggesting that I would look elsewhere but given whatever you said last night, I guess we are a few more lifetimes apart from each other right now.  Anyways, having dealt with the maid, I quickly packed up and started out.  I hadn't withdrawn money yet and given that it was already nearing 8 in the morning, I knew I had to have breakfast before I set out.  I went to the Shanthi Sagar close to home and picked up a truck load of money from the nearby Citibank ATM.  I picked up a 2 ltr bottle of water and a measly looking biscuit packet and got back to my car.  When I switched on the ignition and glanced at the clock, it showed 8.15AM.  By the way, I don't wear a watch and if I need to know the time, I need to either look at the my cellphone or the clock mounted on the dashboard of my car.  Why don't I wear a watch?  hhmm....thats a tough one.  I guess I stopped wearing initially because I didn't have a good watch but later on, I got so used to it that when I did get a good watch, I didn't like the feel of something strapped around my wrist all day.  Much later on, about 11 months back actually, Ricky bought me a watch --- it was a blue sports watch, don't remember the brand and I think it cost around $25, and I was kicked to wear it.  Everytime I looked at the time, it would remind me of her and given that she was going to be 15,000 miles away, that was the best thing I could do -- stare at the watch and get reminded of her.  Anyways, starting as late as 8.15 was a terrible thing to do.

      Today, I decided to work from the MG Road office for two reasons.  One, Infy was announcing its first quarter results today and I wanted to stay back and watch the Boardroom discussion on CNBC.  For those of you who aren't familiar with this CNBC programme, let me clarify that what they show is not the actual Board Room proceedings but they invite people like the CEO, COO, CFO etc and ask them questions about the company  performance.  Anyways, this program was meant to start at 10.30AM IST and was to last an hour.  Having to drive down to ECity after all this would mean that I would reach office only by lunchtime.    The other reason why I chose to work from MG Rd office was because I had a dinner appointment tonight.  Now, let me not make this sound so formal.  Actually, I am to meet Damini later this evening and we planned to go out from "8PM to 10PM".  Apparently, she needs to get back home by 10.30 latest and therefore the timeslot, almost making me feel like its some kind of an appointment.  Thankfully, she stays closer to home and I usually drop her back on my way home --- giving us that much more touchtime.  Ahem!  Now, stop letting your dirty mind think in the devious way it normally thinks.  Sure, Damini is very pretty but she's not the kind of girl that I would like to be seeing on a regular basis.    So, having come to the MG Rd office, Iam propped up in one of those half-cabins and have been slogging my butt off, all day so far.  Its 3.15PM right now and I have this dying urge to take a few minutes to catch a game of bowling.  I have 31 unread emails but thankfully they dont sound earth-shattering.  I tried logging into my company intranet site a little while earlier because I wanted to complete some formalities for my parents' insurance policy, but the damn site wasn't working.  I guess I'll stop blogging for now and get back to my usual daily grind.  By the way, I was pretty kicked last night because Hazy called me and we chatted up a bit.  This was the first time she was calling me on her own, and considering that we dated last week and she called first, I take it as a good sign.  More about her later.

       	 		 		 After 7 hours of driving, I finally got to Chennai in one piece. The drive was enjoyable, barring the last couple of hours when I started to fight with Ricky on the phone (as always). 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Entering Chennai City!

       	 		 		 I dont remember when I started doing this but every now and then, I take a picture of me through the mirror. Its kinda wierd but I think the genisis of this goes back to a website that I saw, full of such pictures. I must find a way to get hold of that URL again. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Another pic thru the mirror 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .

       	 		 		 I hadn't really picked up too much stuff to eat but my passenger seat was messy alright. I'd much rather have some interesting company on my next drive to Chennai. Yes! I plan to do another Chennai drive soon. Hoping to get someone to go with me then. So, people who are reading this....get the hint? ;-) 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink The inside of my car 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .

       	 		 		 This is the spot where I first stopped after driving for nearly 3 hours non-stop. The reason why I had to stop was because my car started to make a funny noise --- actually, it wasn't funny really. I started to think I would have to abort my drive, given how loud the sound was. Strangely, the sound stopped shortly after this break and I could proceed to driving at 80 kmph consistantly thereafter 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink My first break during the 7 hour journey 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .

       	 		 		 These roads can put even the best of US freeways to shame! This was a 6 lane highway closer to Ranipet, around 250 kms away from Bangalore. A delight to drive on this road. I noticed that they were constructing tollgates, so I suspect that driving on this road would attract a toll charge shortly 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Roads - US style!

      Folks,  For reasons I don't want to disclose, I am having to stop blogging on this site.  In some ways, I feel sad because Ricky got me to this site and on this last date, when I logged in to write this small note, I accidentally discovered that Ricky had disregarded my bans and has been visiting Sreekesh's blog and commenting on some of them.  Anyways, goodbye everyone.....
