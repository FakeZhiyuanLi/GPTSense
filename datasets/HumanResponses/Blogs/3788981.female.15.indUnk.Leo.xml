      yesterday... was my birthday.... a birthday i would never forget... coz i'm 15! 15! 15! argghhh... and then... we had this interview for the Asean 12th exchange student program... i bet i wouldn't be chosen.. for sure they would choose tresa... *sigh*.... and we also lost the cheerleading competition... the judges were totally unfair!!! fyi, we made our routine all by ourselves! and that.. that section two hired a trainer for them to make their totally boring routine... and they even had slow moves, which is not fit for a cheerleading routine, right??? and we only got the 2nd place... i'll kill them! i just want to tell them that us, section one, made big sacrifices... from staying awake till 11 pm just perfecting and making our routine... to hearing those big mouths of our moms and dads.. and even enduring the sprains, body aches, ulcer and headaches just to practice our moves.. and it just resulted to N-O-T-H-I-N-G!!!!!!!! well, who said life was fair?? nobody... a life full of misery, cheating, problems... i hate our lives! maybe the body aches was ok for me... but the point that i missed or big planned attendance in our church's evangelical mission... i planned to attend that a week before... but then, i still have to miss it so that i could be with my classmates and make more cheerleading moves... just the thought of all our sacrifices were nothing kill me... i even did not make a single assignment so that i could give my whole time for this cheerleading.. *sigh* i hate them!!! i hate them!!! so right now, i'm at home... taking a break... coz my ulcer is getting worse... til here....

      after 2 weeks... i'm 15 yrs old! arggghhhh... i don't want to grow up... growing up means having a lot of responsibilities... that means... no more computer.. no more tv... no more time for friends! waahhh!!! *sigh* i just wish there's a youth fountain/ spring... i'd surely go there... (pala babyface! ^_^X) this week's been fun... i guess... i had many challenges (nakanakz naman... parang extra challenge)... and, i'm, again, a leader in our english subject... damn, 6 subjects of responsibilities! i just wush i could survive it... (dream! believe! survive! rizal high!) ahahaha... yesterday, i went to ateneo de manila and attended a seminar about robotics... it wasn't really about makin robotics, 'twas more of automizing a creation... we did some programming and construction of "robots"... the robots were made of LEGO... i just found out that lego has a new feature called mindstorms... like i said it was more of automizing a creation... the pressure on me was a LOT! coz, i was the youngest in the group... all the other people were all teachers! and then, my groupmates, from phil sci hs went home early coz they have something important to do... so, me and that old grumpy woman was left in our group... 'twas one of the best days for me... imagine... me doing all the work... programming... constructing.... testing.. experimenting.... woohoo!   oh, before i forget... we have a new puppy! puppy! puppy! puppy!.... it's a chow chow... and it's the cutest thing i ever saw this week!(syempre, may iba ring cute) i was the one who named it... and his name is TENSHI... w/c means...

      waaaahhhH! i can't take it anymore... the pressure on me is getting worse EVERYDAY... we have assignments everyday.. and we have quizzes everyday... why can't we enjoy hs life? while the other people are havin' fun... laughing ang giggling with their friends... treasuring and cherishing every moment in their lives... as if they don't have problems... well, that's the sacrifice in being a sec. 1 student.. what if, i requested that i'd be transferred to another section, as long as it's not one of the pilot sections... 5 maybe? but, that, would be the worst thing to happen to me.. with that that evil guy around there... kill him! ahhh! ahahaha... *sigh*... my dad even uninstalled hello from picasa so, i can't upload any pic... i'd have to install it again secretly...  and there's this guy who keep on buggin' me in my cel... he keeps on calling me every 5 hours, when the fact is, i haven't given my number to anyone lately... not a single living cell(^_^)... he keeps on sayin "ur special to me... "... ewwwwwww.... inde kami talo! ahahaha...!  "no more! please! no more! i can't take it anymore! i beg you! please!" - from idontknowewankomalaykodikamiclose... ^_^x

       Friendster? Myspace? Xanga? Blogspot? Multiply? Face-Pic?  Blogger? Fark?      dang... that's not all... i just know few sites... but still.... how did they become popular? what's their purpose? anyone???     here's what i scooped up:  A weblog is usually  urlLink defined  as a personal or noncommercial web site that uses a dated log format (usually with the most recent addition at the top of the page) and contains links to other web sites along with commentary about those sites. A weblog is updated frequently and sometimes groups links by specific subjects, such as politics, news, pop culture, or computer issues. Some people are of the opinion that  urlLink Mosaic's What's New page  in 1993 was the first weblog. It was essentially a list of links that a few people thought were worth passing along to others. However, it wasn't until December 1997 that  urlLink Jorn Barger  coined the term "weblog" in his  urlLink Robot Wisdom Weblog . In 1998, only a handful of blogs existed, and many of the bloggers knew each other and linked to each other's sites.  urlLink Rebecca Blood , author of The Weblog Handbook, notes that one preeminent site listed only 23 blogs in existence at the beginning of 1999. The  urlLink media  started noticing blogs later in 1999 and drew attention to the phenomenon. But it was the proliferation of free weblog-creation programs in 1999 that made blogging into a hugely popular pastime. Before this software was widely available, most weblogs were hand-coded by web developers and others who taught themselves HTML. The new programs made it easy for anyone to create their own weblog.  urlLink Blogger  was released in August 1999 and was an immediate hit. This simple weblog application allows users to create any kind of weblog they desire. By October 2000, Blogger users were creating  urlLink 300 new blogs a day , and the Blogger directory had over 5,500 blogs listed. In November of the same year, the 10,000th Blogger weblog was created. As of 2002, Blogger claimed over 750,000 users. The rise of tools like Blogger also changed the content of weblogs. While they had begun as link-driven sites offering alternative viewpoints on news and other subjects, weblogs began to collide with  urlLink online journals . Blogger-style tools allowed links and commentary to quickly grow into longer essays and diaries on the Web. Online journals had existed before this, but weblog applications made journals easier to manage for those who didn't know HTML. Weblogs and online journals are often confused, and they can frequently overlap in content and style. But  urlLink purists  point out that a person writing in an online journal or diary is logging their life, not the Web. Weblogs still exist to log what's going on around the World Wide Web.  so far... for me... i think... multiply is a lot better than any other weblog/community... Coz it has soooo many features.... and everyone can see your posts... even if they are not your contacts! they may be friends of your friends.... friends of your friends' friends... it's cool... just check it out... i'm totally havin fun with it...   so that's it...   wala lang magawa... tinatamad na kc ako... wala lang talaga....
