       So if I was ninja I think I would use a staff and three daggers all three different colors like blue, orange, and green with different poisons on them. my staff would have a sword built and a giant smoke bomb on top for ninja vanish. I would wear goggles b/c a ninja is not good with out his eyes. I don't know what the ninja code says about transportation but I am lazy so I would roll in a suburu wrx me and my ninja pal's can get around in style, and carry crazy weapons with us for all situation. if I could I would make an anime about me and my ninja friends similar to ninja scroll but more modern, but fight warlocks and vampires. What kind of ninja would you be? and I need a wheel man, (that means driver)

       You know, what I have never been good at is making things with my hands, face it if you can't see the finished project in your mind then its hard to build it. but dang if I can't coach a soccer team. I wake up at nights write plays or practice drills down and run them at the next practice. I can make any player feel like a winner weather we win or lose. I can motivate, if you know me you would find it hard to believe but on the soccer field I become "coach" and have a great attitude and make people feel good, and people make me feel good and wanted. I hope I can make that my calling, I fear if I don't act soon I might miss my window to work my way up to the pros someday. We all have our extreme goals, that is mine. On a finer note I feel like my friends have all become closer and stronger and ...Better magic players... Since we saw each other for a weekend and we need to do that more often, and more often and more often...

       I think green is my favorite color, I think it makes me look a little bit slimier and if you have ever seen me you know what I am taking about. grass is beautiful girls with green eyes make me think smart, pretty and lovable, green shirts dive me nuts, green shorts makes me think so hard I can hardly talk to the girl. Green cars make you feel proud. green magic decks are strong and powerful. green soda makes belly's happy. you know what made lord of the rings such a great trilogy... All the lovely green shots of plains and green mountains and green elves.

       Man what a great week. I got my first full paycheck with my 2 dollar raise. I got to hang with all my good friends all week. I got to see why I changed my life, and went cold turkey on all drug's. But enough about me, man where would anyone be without good friends and conversation. I'll tell you what I would have gone crazy by now, or at least crazier then I am. My friends make me feel better about not having a girlfriend, or even knowing any girls outside of them. If anyone knows me they know I wont go to the movie theater much anymore, I will tell you all way and hope it comes out the way I feel about the way I feel       I told myself I wont go to a movie till I have a real date to take, and I love my friends but for me to stay true and try to bust my ass to get a girl to go with me I need to not go, don't get me wrong if it is a movie need to be seen at the theater I will go and see it but not many have come out, so I hope this is read and understood, and taking seriously, because it is serious to me. Its getting harder and harder to be a true 23 year old man, you all know what that means.  Sorry this one was so about me I will write a better one next time.

       The Tampa bay lighting just won lord stanly's cup. Great coaching, great players, great vision. if you like any sport and did not watch this game, you are no sports fan. you cant ask for anything better, clean skating, great checks, beautiful goals, I mean come on 2-1, laker game was a blow out, last super bowl was good for like the last five mins, I lover every sport but hockey no doubt has the best finals in its sport. The smell of the ice, the touch of the tape, the look in their eyes, its all about love for themselves, and the game. football players hit the bench for a hangnail, basketball players sit out for personal reason, hockey players play till there arm's fall off then they get them sewn back on and play 2 more periods. I am tired of people only liking football and basketball, what lame sports, compare to soccer, and hockey, and lacrosse, not so much about big lame scores more about holding onto 1 score games, that's how you determine, men from boys

       Hey let me tell you something, magic is no game to mock. Sure it may look lame on the outside looking in, but when you start to throw the cards done and layith the smackdown with zombies or Artifacts you feel the real power of the game. I had never played before this weekend, and bagged on it all the time, but now I am hooked, thanks John and Christine and Jacob. I have found the heart of the cards. what's up with Smarty Jones he lag bubbled there at the end of the Belmont to lose the Triple Crown, should have brought a stick and trip that other horse. Well I had a hell of a weekend hanging out with my friends, I wish we could do that more often, I love the conversations you can have with your friends, and the games made fun by playing them with your friends.

       Check it out I got a 2 dollar raise today, and I don't have anyone to go drinking with tonight. I cant believe that he gave me a raise. and I kick my helper to another lead guy and I get a new one, what a great week and last night me Jake and rock beat three computers in starcraft, that was pimpish... did you know water is better cold but you can drink more Luke warm. did you know a six pack of Dr. Pepper a day keeps the headaches away, for good. always slightly shake your beer to the mix the 80% water, and get the great taste to the end. thunderbolt

       Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me Everyone should play Amplitude, for 40 mins a week. If happiness comes in the form of a Rolling Rock, or Corona, or 40 oz, then I say drink up, you know I am. We have gone back to 8 hour days and that has made me very happy, I am tired of working 10's in 101 degree weather I think it was frying my brain. I think if I was a sim I would cheat and rosebud myself to have everything in the world. If I was a paladin I would make sure my friends always got the best auras, so we could kill the hate with 50% more ice attack in our shinguards. I think if everyone played soccer no one would ever watch a pro basketball game again, unless you are a hardcore fan like myself. If I was on a desert island I would take a two way paging item to communicate with my friends, and blog. I think if everyone stop caring so much the world would be a "stoner" place to live. caring is good, over caring is harsh. Always wear stripes, or plaid on Saturdays. When listening to Cash always hear what he says or you will miss a great story. When you are hungry eat what sounds good to you not to some sumch at slimfast... Eating worms is a wired hobby. Go fishing as much as possible, you don't even have to catch anything to have peace. Never eat a fish from a black lake, you cant even see what's in there...

       So I feel like everyone is making excuses for me not wanting to go to the Rocky's house around John and My birthday. Since I feel like it is pointless to celebrate "my" birthday I do see it ass a great time to hang with John and Christine and Jacob... as for my best friend Rocky... I feel like so much has changed, like everyday SB molds him into a hater of Bako... like no matter what I say my word is crap and only things spoken by Santa Barbarians is right and make since. We see eye to eye on nothing... Which saddens me. Statements are worthless where I come from "" so I will profile go down there as long that everyone else goes to just hangout, no birthday stuff, on my behave. I know I am a jerk, I try to blame all my hurt and anger on rocky leaving 4 or so years ago, but can you blame me we hung out 295 days of 365, and about 10 hours of those days. In this time I have grown a great, no fantastic friendship with Jacob, and I feel like I am always bringing him down b/c I cant move on, and wine about Rocky's changed life without me. I have also hung out with John and Christine a lot or at least when they come to town, and we have a great time, but I am sure I wine like a little jerk to them about rocky too,  I need to give my friends that want to be a part of my life more time and just deal with those that don't... TO be cont'd

       Check it out I love to hate? don't get me wrong I don't feel this way about everything, just most things. what's with people who think they know what's best for you or for that matter think they know more then you, that's piss.... weather or not they do or don't keep it to yourself, that's the only way friendships work. what's with people who think beach towns are so much better then any place else? Sure they are nice to go visit at, but really they are still just towns with problems the same as towns 2 hours from the beach much better when really I feel like I have it better b/c why go somewhere and change when I can stay the same here... what's with people you work with, even work under you, thinking they know how to do something better then you have been doing for 3 years? Piss on them. I am a worker I get my jobs done when the boss wants it done... You line them out on the job you want them to do and they do it ass backwards and make you have to fix it... Like that's faster 2 people on... Feel better for now.

       "good old boys" a term to describe nascar watchers or country music listeners. I guess you could call me that. I see them one of the few groups with respect for themselves and have been staying true for over 100 years. I watch things like cmt and there list of 40 greatest men (country/rock singers), and there list has men of hard lives, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Willie Nelson,and Elvis Presley, men of lifestyle, George Straight, Buck Owens, Conway Twitty, and Tim McGraw, and men who wrote and written songs that changed everyone's lives, Johnny Cash, Charlie Pride, Hank Williams Sr., and Garth Brooks. I feel proud of these men and feel in good company when I listen to them. I just think to myself what kind of lame ass list would mtv come up with, it would have killers, rapest, kids, boy bands, non song writers, and people who call themselves punk singers, b/c we all know you can't be puck if you are sold out on mtv. I don't get how anyone can watch that channel and love there music, I watch cmt and see a cash video and I wont lie I get up throw one hand in the air and get close to dropping a tear every time, or see a Merle Haggard video and play an air guitar to sound like the bad ass he is, what do mtv people do, proably do what I do "click" "click" "click" (that's turning it on changeing the channel off of mtv turning it of and writing this) "click"
