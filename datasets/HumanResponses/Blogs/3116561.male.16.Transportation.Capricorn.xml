       Screw fricken Watertown. Town is the worst fricken town in the wrost fricken state in the world. I just got back from my road test. Guess what!! i didnt pass. i got one point marked off, and the point was becuz there's 50 one way streets in watertown if u didnt know. so i thought i was on a one way street, and she said make a left turn here, i pulled to the left side of the street i was on, and she said.. this is a two way street, so i quickly moved into the right lane, and turned left and finished the rest of my test. We came back and she said ... Well you did everything perfect however, you thought you were on a one way street, and it was actaully a 2 way street so you'll have to come back. WTF!!! i did everything perfect and got a perfect score except i was so nervous and wasn't thinking and before i turned i went into the left side of the street and you fail me!!! Yeah and i'm just gonna "come back" yeah no problem for me at all..... except i live an hour away.. Yeah real easy for her to say.. she dosent have to take off of work, make sure her mom or dad takes off of work, and miss a half day of school just to "come back" to watertown. Oh yeah and in case she didnt know... EVERY FRICKEN DMV is booked up till like freakin july, so no i can't just "come back" in a week and redo it. But anyway i went online today and found an appointment in fondu lac may 12. at least fond du lac isnt so gay that they have to take their students on one way streets the whole test. gosh this pisses me off... this is exactly what she said, "You are an excellent driver, and would've easily passed, but you were blocking traffic on the left side." HELLO i was in the left side of the street, was extremly nervous and moved over after 1 second. besides who the heck drives on 1 way streets every day. NO ONE. hartford has umm lemme see ONE, 1 way street, in the whole city. Should be a fun day at school tomorrow listening to everyone saying HAHA u failed !!! :)

       Wow; go to school today.. didnt realize i had so many fans of this blog. i'm kind of like a retarded celebrity now. Well school today was bad i guess. idk i was really tired all day cuz i got like what.. 4 hours of sleep?? and i failed like all of those tests i took b4 spring break. just like i predicted! :) that really pisses me off... i study and put in like all this work and i fail all that comp lit stuff and history, and on top of that the teachers dont know i've been putting in 22 hours, i swear i get like 1 day off a week and thats on top of doing all that homework. it's like pick one or the other: study or make money, im making money. School also REALLY SUCKED cuz i got drawn all over by ummm certain people. I get home and my mom is like oh my gosh.. i was embarrassed before about going in public with you but now i'll never go anywhere with you. I'm also susposedly going to 1st grade tomorrow with melanie because i have such a "passion" for coloring. I kept telling her, "MOM, i didnt draw on myself, some girls behind me did." she said, "Matthew........you mean u didnt know they were doing that to you?", "no i didnt, i said"  so then she said, "wouldnt u get the idea something is on your face and that their drawing on you when people are looking at ur face and laughing?" ,"No wait matt, i guess you wouldnt know, becasuse people laugh at your face even when you don't have a painting drawn on it."   YEAH.... thanks mom that makes me feel great. lol I'm still deciding what kind of car i wanna get. either a grand AM or a newer cavalier. whatever kind... i want it silver... hard to find though. ummm spring break was all right.... gotta go tho type later  bi

       haha......ok i will write more posts, but seriously i am tha gangsta of KML.. anyway well let's see its 12:36 in the morning and i Feel wide awake!!! I feel like 500 pounds lighter since i got all of those projects and tests done. i prolly failed the tests cuz i was doin the projects but hey I dont have to worry about that for another week !!! SPRING BREAK ..... GOING TO MARDI GRAS!!!! YEAH umm no actaully just staying in little old hartford. this week was the most tiring week for me but it was awesome too cuz guess what .. i got skittles. i thought rachel and emily put something on them too but i was wrong. they were really good until JUSTIN and ABE (not me) spilt them all over the floor. oh well thanks again rachel and emily.   in other news .. me and justin had some fights this week :( just when i think things are looking up for us i catch him grabbing kyle's butt AGAIN in phy ed. WHAT IS THAT! Thats usually me that gets pantsed or my butt he grabs not kyle's! kyle is a man whore. thats all i have to say, kellye, u should see him in phyed... he hits on EVERY guy there ,sister. then again in phy ed everyone is gay idk why, alotta testosterone floating around.  Last night i was tired and sick so i didnt wanna do anything. joe stayed over tho.. we had fun... i bought this awesome new game called NBA Ballers. its tight. so i woke up at noon then friday and we went to church at like 1:30. it's really eerie when everyone leaves and no one can or wants to say a word. I couldnt imagine seeing passion of the christ on a good friday, i cant even imagine seeing it again. it's wierd how now whenever Pastor castillo will read from the bible or talk about jesus's crucifiction, i start to think of the images in the movie. So i came home from church and played "ballers" watched some basketball, then went to "the courts' and played some basketball. then called mel up cuz we were planning on doing something over break. we were susposed to go bowling and come here but she ended up coming here and we played frogger on the gaycube,couldnt get past the first platform lol. then we made smoothies, tryed to bake, made a CD lol. we went to taco bell and blockbuster then and then OMG it was the funniest thing.  we were driving  u know where the mineshaft is in downtown and i kept telling mel what a bad driver she was and she was laughin say no she wasnt and blah, so first off shes in the wrong lane and then we're laughing about stuff and talking and she RAN THE RED LIGHT  LMAO! i didnt believe it. i laughed so hard, and she kept saying oh my gosh, god is going to send me to hell ... to hell! lol  Tomorrows gonna suck cuz i gotta work 6 hours then go to my aunts for easter for the whole night. i dont think my mom knows easter is on sunday, cuz i have no other idea why we're going saturday.   wow i type a lot in here. 10 more days till i have to endure lunch at school :(  hey rachel, steph and emily add me to AIM sometime     smitty1234567  goonight sue (name of my diary)

       Dear diary, lol first off i dont know why i'm doing this, but i guess i'm doing this so why not.  So anyway this is my first post.   So what all happened today? well last night i stayed up till 2 AM dong homework, so i was tired pretty much the whole day, then the whole day basically sucked in classes cuz it seemed like every single teacher had some kind of test for us tomorrow, and I'm not gonna have any time to study. lunch was the horriying expierence it always is for me thanks to none other than rachel and emily.....then geography was fun as always cuz ms. semon is the teacher and I always crack up whenever she yells at eddy me or jake. she's a nazi beast i swear. then religion came and baically all that happened was emily did my homework and I tryed to help her with her problems that I know becasue I just knew what she was thinking not cuz of some "blog" thing she was talking about... (dont know what she wastalking about ) lol so emily suggested i make some blog so we could work our problems out, and I guess it's a good idea becasue we do have a lotta problems that i think we need to work on.. lol. i have no clue why i made this since no one will ever read it, but maybe it'll be good i let some feelings out. (I sound so sensitive now......:)) umm then after school I went to work and it was boring as always but hey it's work and i need the money and have no other ways of getting it for now. Other problem I have with work is becasue it takes so much of my time and also I feel really bad cuz lately it's been harder going to church becasue they always schedule me to work on church days. so i started taking off more on sundays and now hopefuly stuff will get better.  My love life is dumb right now. mainly cuz any girl i would think aboiut going out with is taken, dosen't wanna a b/f, or i basically have no chance with becuz well yea i'm mem, and idk if i even want a girlfriend cuz stuff always turns out bad in the end, and girls have way too many issues well at least freshmen girls do so thats why i would never date one of them again. I honestly think maybe its better just being friends instead with girls cuz u dotn have to worry about all that extra garbage and stuff that couples go through. Although it'd be nice just to have someone u could hold and talk to and have fun with. SO idk i'm just confused with that but not really worried about it, cuz i'm busier with other stuff. Waiting for spring break to come, gotta go finish my comp lit and geography....

       i know rachel.. friday was awesome.. we gotta do it some other time.. anyways u wanted answers to ur questions well i'll try to give u the matt smith expertise and since it's late and im in a "sensitive" mood i know what im talking about (hopefully)  Why does change suck? Becasue most people don't like what their not used to.. change usually sucks at first but it all works out  Why does one thought always stay in the back of your head? Cuz it's what ur worried or excited the most about  Why do heartaches hurt so badly? Cuz it really sucks when u got feelings for ppl and basically  they say to u that they dont care at all about those feelings to u when u get ur heart broken, and that sucks  Why do bird's tweet and cat's meow? umm.... why is my hair red.. idk... cuz god made it that way Why do people judge others? Cuz some people are insecure and A-Holes  How come I feel self-centered whenever I write in this? I dont know why u do.. probley cuz ur writing about urself...  u shouldnt tho  How come I always look at the negative side to things? I dont know why u do.. u shouldnt tho.. cuz u got so much going for u and so much other good things like good friends (u already know that)  Why does my mood change within seconds? probley cuz we're 16... it's funny cuz thats exactly what happens to me too... i'm really happy and stuff for one moment, then i think about something and my mood switches like that.. i just dont care anymore.. and try to stay happy, and when im sad i go to my "happy place" lol (happy gilmore)... stuff will get better in a few years, just enjoy everything good  How come most sports include a spherical object? what the heck is a spherical???  How come science is so boring? CUZ Im NOT IN IT!! duh  Why am I still typing? umm ur not right now.. ur looking at a computer screen... stop whining lol  im like dr. phil now i guess u could say.. any more questions?? post em

       I am really excited right now..... I got in for a driving test at westbend, this thursday. everyone says west bend is the easiest, so hopefully I should pass it. Joe's over right now, we're waiting for the Hornets/Heat game to start. Later we're going to his Dad's work to hopefully buy a car for me. And it's gonna be really sweet cuz we're going to the hummer dealer off HWY 45 near milwaukee, and me my dad and him are gonna test drive some hummers. but the bad thing is i'm not steph and i can't just give the dealer 50,000 dollars cash and buy one........ I really wish I had a gucci Hummer :( just like steph!   umm i dont know if i even wanna talk about yesterday..... oh man..... i went paintballing for the first time. Yea umm I got lost in the woods. this is how it happened, we started the game and 5 minutes into it i heard someone yelling. I figured mike or someone got shot. and then i heard like joel calling my name but i thought it was a trap so I stayed put under the tree I was laying under. All of a sudden it started to rain, and I was laying in the muddiest pile of mud ever. So i stayed in the same spot for 2 hours, I kept looking for them to see where they were. I couldnt see em, so I decided i'd just head back. I go back to joel's house, and everyone is inside, and they're like WHERE WERE YOU. and everyone started laughing. I said.. what the heck, I was sitting out there for 2 hours, dead silent looking for you guys. lol they went inside like 2 hours ago they said and when they called my name they were trying to tell me that they thought it was gonna rain so we should head in. I HATE PAINTBALLING  Yeah I gotta work tonight at 6-10, it sucks but oh well. My sister's confirmation is tomorrow morning at St. Paul's. Lol Rachel.. member our confirmation? The hymn we were susposed to memorize, we sang one verse and then didn't remeber the 2nd or third so all we did was stand there and look blankly. I remeber i was laughing so hard when I saw Mr. Hosbach's face.. he was sitting in the front of the church just shaking his head. Kind of summed up our whole 8th grade year.  Hope u have a good Sat and SUn... see u mon
