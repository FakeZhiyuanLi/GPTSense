      Yeah so I've been doing lot's of exciting things this weekend.  Helping with my grandparents garage sale was extremely fun and interesting.  At least I sold some of my stuff and made $50.  That was cool.  I don't know what I'm going to do this week... it looks pretty open so if anyone has any ideas let me know.  Well I guess that's it...   maybe i could tell some more fun camp stories.  We did some fun stuff at the talent show... like this weird cup game/skit thing and bethanne fell off her chair and it was funny... yeah well anyway I guess that's all.

      So I decided to get a blog because I thought it would be cooler than just having a written journal.  I'm not sure how much I'll remember to post in it, but hopefully at least once a week.  In case you don't know me here's some background: I'm 17, I have curly blonde hair, and I'm a christian.  Well I guess that's enough background for now, so I'll start my actual post.  I just got back from being a counselor at Bible Memory Camp.  It was so awesome.  BethAnne and I had eight 4th grade girls.  At first I wasn't so sure how well it was gonna work, but it turned out awesome.  By the end of the week, everyone seemed so close to God.  Almost everyone made new commitments.  I became so close to the other campers and counselors that it was really hard to say goodbye.  I think I hugged the other girl counselors like 80 times each.  So much happened it's hard to write it all.  One thing that was cool was how 4 of the girl counselors dressed for banquet night.  Three of us have curly hair and BethAnne has really long hair so we decided to from our hair and wear mismatched clothes.  Let's just say we were definitely the center of attention.  We looked soo awesome.  I'm gonna miss them a lot.  At least I'll get to see most of them when I go to high school camp.  We're gonna try to meet at Holly's house the Saturday before it so that we can hang out before camp.  It was really great, but I am glad to be home and relax for awhile.  I'll write more about it later, but that's all for now.  Peace out.

       Well... today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I guess I'm gonna sort of have to be choosy what I write about because I could really take up a lot of time and space and I just don't have enough energy.     First off I have to say that camp was awesome and even better than I could have expected. God's been doing so much stuff in my life lately and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf I guess, but anyway's back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and we stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, walmart and watched movies. It was pretty fun and it was a good way to start camp without being so tired.     Camp started off great and just seemed to get better. I got to see a lot of people that I really missed and even meet some new people. Wow, it's just so hard to describe. I guess I'll just go over the highlights and if anyone wants to know more they can ask. Mostly it just consisted of playing fun games and worshipping God. What could be better? One of the things we had to do was get up at 4 AM and each team had to eat a gallon of ice cream. I ate quite a lot and it was actually sort of good despite the fact that it was cold. For the thursday night game we went bowling, but before that we had a youth rally. It was pretty awesome and I think that would be great if we could have something like that around here. Maybe the youth group could do something like that I don't know, but we really need to start doing more outreach. On the way back from Indiana I saw this homeless guy with a sign that said:    Homeless Out of work Needs money for food God Bless    It made me so sad and I really wanted to do something but I didn't have much extra money and I'm not so sure it would be a good idea to approach him without a guy with us. I kinda wish we would of bought him some food or something. Well I guess now all I can do is just pray for him. It's really sad though.     I really want to go to this mission thing with Bible Memory. It's in Florida and it's the first week of April. They do a lot of witnessing and stuff I'm not exactly sure but I really think it would be great. The problem is I need $350 for food, travel, shelter, etc. I really need to get a job I guess or maybe I could just try to raise it.    You know what's weird....I keep talking in an Indiana accent. It's weird. I wish I would stop. Well anyway I'm just going to end and say that my life has taken a turn for the better and maybe I'll write more later when I'm well rested and then I can tell more details.

        BECAUSE I'M LEAVING FOR INDIANA TOMORROW!!!!       &nbsp; Ok so I'm a little excited.&nbsp; Today I'm working on washing my clothes and packing and stuff.&nbsp; I leave with BethAnne tomorrow at like 2 or 3.&nbsp; I know you're all gonna miss me dreadfully but don't worry, I'll only be gone for a week.&nbsp; Most of the people that read my blog are going to camp anyways, but probably not until sunday or monday.&nbsp; It's gonna be SUPER fun.&nbsp; I love road trips.&nbsp; Imagine me and BethAnne in a car together for about 4 hours.... scary I know.&nbsp; Well everyone, feel free to leave me tons of comments while I'm gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; EEEEEE.... I'm so excited.&nbsp;

      I hate it when my posts get deleted ant then I have to retype them.&nbsp;&nbsp; anger.....  &nbsp;  So I went shopping with hannah and got a bunch of stuff at old navy.&nbsp; I also got these cool flip-flops that say disco queen.&nbsp; I now have about 87 pairs of flip-flops... or maybe just 8.&nbsp; I also got some flip-flop toe-rings.&nbsp; They're fun.&nbsp; We ate at panda express and I got the usual.&nbsp; The last time I wrote this I went into more detail but somehow I lost the motivation.&nbsp; After I got home we went putt-putting with the youth group and Leslie brought chip.&nbsp; The free fudge was good and my team won.&nbsp; Then we went to pizza hut and had some pizza...go figure.&nbsp; A lot of licking happened on the way home but I won't get into that.  &nbsp;  Today I was rudely dragged out of bed by my mom because or computer got a virus.&nbsp; I had to download the repair tool but all is good now.&nbsp; We went to st. vincents and I got a couple books but nothing great.&nbsp; The guy that works there was whistling do you know the muffin man.&nbsp; He asked me how I was doing and I said good.... in that weird way that I say all words that have double 00s or so my brother says.&nbsp; Now I'm sitting at home in the sweltering heat, trying to drink enough caffinated beverages to not be completely out of it today.

      So last night I got a call from Angie and she wanted me to babysit today so I said I would.&nbsp; I had to get up at 7 in order to be there on time, but I only had to stay til 2.&nbsp; It was ok... not bad but not exactly fun.&nbsp; I like Chad and Angie's kids.&nbsp; After that I went home.&nbsp; Pretty boring... but at least I made some money and helped Angie out.&nbsp; Wow at least I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll actually have some money and do something fun.&nbsp; I forgot how&nbsp;unfun working actually was.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I've finally decided which senior pictures I'm getting... but I'm not telling... it's a suprise. &nbsp; Today I've been wondering... who all keeps beeping when they go by my house?&nbsp; Ok I know Ronnie does... and once I think it was Tom, but we get like 20 beeps a day... seriously.&nbsp; Sometimes I see the vehicle and it's like wow I don't know anyone with a truck like that or I've never seen that car in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't understand.&nbsp; Is there this sign that says : Please Beep at Our House?&nbsp; One day my brother was like... I think people see my car here and beep and I was like don't flatter yourself, they beep just as much when you're not here.&nbsp; But anyway... If you have any idea who keeps beeping at our house let me know.

      Yeah I guess that's the only thing I can say about yesterday... moving on...  &nbsp;  Today I went to the sunday school picnic whic was SUPER FUN.&nbsp; I ate some extremely good food, went swimming, and won the sack race.&nbsp; For that I got this hot shirt that says " I won this at Riverside's sunday school picnic".&nbsp;&nbsp; The back is the same except it's a mirror image.&nbsp; After that Sarah dragged me along to Susan's grad party... how fun.&nbsp; We stayed for like 15 minutes.  &nbsp;  On the way home I passed glen hill &nbsp;in my car and I was thinking... "Wow, &nbsp;I must look extremely hot driving in my hot station wagon with my hot&nbsp;good will sunglasses, listening to my hot techno remix cd."

      First off I have to say that I, Alecia, mooned Jared Southworth today for a meesly 5 bucks.&nbsp; That's right, but lets start at the beginning... &nbsp; Today I went shopping with Sarah and Leslie.&nbsp; We went to Saginaw and stopped at the salvation army and the red eye, after eating lunch at the Panda Express (no sarah, that's not a movie).&nbsp; At the sav I bought a Phil&nbsp;keychain, 3 books, and a&nbsp;beverly hills camp t-shirt.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course since we were in Saginaw, Leslie had to stop and see Nick Osmond aka Chip.&nbsp; That was fun enough and then we went to some cd store and stopped at Blue Knight on the way back.&nbsp; The order of that may or may not be how I stated it.&nbsp; On the way home, on 13, &nbsp;we were behind this annoying red truck that thought it could drive halfway into the other lane, so we passed them and went really slow... I think they got mad because later they passed us and the old hairy guy felt the need to flash us.&nbsp; It was like ooh... wow... that was vicious.&nbsp; Then there was this guy and girl that had to stare at us every time we went by, so then the next time me and sarah did it.&nbsp; This started a war and they sped up and passed us and then the girl mooned us.... great.&nbsp; So we tried to speed up and show them our "your butt needs a tan" sign.&nbsp; But they were going at least 90 and we were unable to catch up.&nbsp; They turned and we beeped at them, but unfortunately we were unable to get revenge, but wait, there's more.&nbsp;&nbsp;We got to AuGres and saw Jared driving beside us and we were like "hey, let's show Jared the sign."&nbsp; Then I said that I would moon him if someone gave me some money so Sarah agreed to give me $3 and Leslie said she would give me $2.&nbsp; It took us until halfway down Tonkey to pass him, but finally we did and I mooned him...&nbsp; then he passed us again and I hid because I was dying of laughter and hoping that maybe he didn't know it was me.&nbsp; Apparently he thought it was funny too because he was laughing... wow I can't believe I did that.&nbsp; Who would've guessed?&nbsp; I wonder if he knew it was me?&nbsp; Anyway it was a fun trip and thinking about it still makes me laugh.

       I'm officialy burnt.&nbsp; Not like lobster burnt, more like tan with a reddish tint.&nbsp; It pains me... but i guess I'll survive. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Mostly the carwash involved holding signs and getting beeped at (ooh how fun!)&nbsp;or washing car after car after car....&nbsp; yeah you get the idea.&nbsp; After the car wash I went with bethanne to west branch.&nbsp; That was fun and I got a tank top at rue 21 for only 4.99.&nbsp; I'm exausted and I think I'm going to go take a nap......

       Guess what!&nbsp;&nbsp; I finished the techno remix cd.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's right, I know you all want a copy, but I'm gonna have to start charging soon.&nbsp; Ok not really but it's extremely hot.    &nbsp;    So about my adventures...       &nbsp;  I went swimming with Ross today.&nbsp; It was too "cold" for Sarah.&nbsp; I think she's just too wimpy.&nbsp; Anyway, we took the innertubes in and it was really windy and we started blowing.&nbsp; After awhile Sarah was just a little speck on the dock so we finally paddled to shore and walked back.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was definitely an adventure... well as adventurous as I've been the last couple weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we went to my house and tried to figure out what we were gonna do for food (the long, strenuous adventure wore us out).&nbsp; We decided to order pizza and then BethAnne showed up and we rented some movies and made it a party.&nbsp; After watching Alice in Wonderland we went for a walk and picked every kind of wildflower, weed, crop, trash, and pepperment schnapps bottle&nbsp;we could find and made it into a boquet for my mom.&nbsp; She loved it of course and we put it in a jar on the kitchen table.&nbsp; Unfortunately it's lovely smell was a bit too much for us so we had to throw it out, but it's memory will be with us forever.....    &nbsp;  Tomorrow I have a PAL (Peer Assistant Leader) car wash in the Pamida parking lot.&nbsp; Everyone should check it out.&nbsp; It's from 9-3.&nbsp; It's the social event of the season.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Yeah it is oh and guess who just went by my house on his moped?  Leslie, see if you can guess.  Heh... yeah I hid though because I just rolled out of bad and am looking so incredibly hot that he might've gotten in an accident or something... wouldn't want that.    So yesterday was another exciting day.  Sarah and I went to St. Vincents because my mom said they had a bunch of movies.  I think they were pretty well picked over when we got there and all I could find was 101 dalmations.  It was cool though because it used to be my favorite movie when I was like 5.  Then we hung out with Leslie at the Legacy for a while and brushed up on our presidents and trivia, although SOME of us already had the questions memorized...  After that we drove around and tried to get lost, but somehow ended up at Sarah's, so we just watched 101 dalmations and ate some grilled cheese until I went home to finish my techno remix cd.... which isn't quit finished, but I think I have all the songs downloaded now.  I know that posting all of the songs might ruin the experience of those who requested a copy, but I'm gonna do it anyway.  Here's the rest of the tecno remixes that I didn't post yet:   - fur elise - coca-cola - sweet dreams - dancing queen - barbie world  - jaws theme - kung fu fighting - the simsons theme - the final countdown - sail away (enya)  Yeah well that's all I think, I might have missed 1 or 2 but I think that's all.

      Sadly, today is rainy and gross.  What ever will I do today?  Perhaps I will download enough techno remixes to make my cd or maybe I'll have a veggietales marathon... oh the possibilities.  Bible study was fun yesterday.  We watched veggietales: I can be your friend.  It was great which is why I was thinking about having a veggietales marathon, but I'm not sure how many movies we have.  Hmmm... I'll have to check.  Speaking of movies, last night I watched Saturday Night Fever.  It was fun and I think I learned some new dance moves.  Who knows what would happen if I tried to use them in public though... could be painful.  I watched it with Ross, Ryan, and BethAnne and we had to brave the severe thunderstorm to get there... oooh scary.  My mom almost didn't let me go... it's like mom, it's just a thunderstorm.  I don't know but anyway.  Ross was extremely cool and gave me one of his Jones.  Berry lemonade even.    Here is a list of some of the new techno remixes I downloaded or will download:  -smurfs theme -cotton eyed joe -spongebob theme -inspector gadget -mr. roboto -holloween theme  there's a lot more but that's all I can remember right now...

      It was so hard to get up this morning for jazz band.  I pressed the snooze like 80 times...  Well I guess I'm just used to getting up at 11.    Anyway, yesterday was fun.  First I went to the beach with Jen, Kev, their kids, and sarah.  The water was actually warm for a change and the beach wasn't quite as nasty as it used to be.  After that was the youth group bonfire and that was exciting.  Ross painted BethAnnes toes and I kissed Ryan's foot.  Ewwww... it was this thing we had to draw from a bowl.  It took me like 10 minutes to actually do it.... yeah anyhow....  then we played I've never, which was fun and I flipped over the chair.    You know what's fun?  Downloading techno remixes.  Techno itself doesn't interest me but techno remixes are hot.  I downloaded ice ice baby, kiss the girl (Little Mermaid), pacman, and I will survive techno remixes.  I think I'm gonna make a cd out of them.  Yeah well I guess that's all for now maybe I'll write more later..

      I definitely took that seriously today.  Haven't done much besides church and the family cookout.  Not that I have much choice about it since my parents think I need to "stay home more".  Seriously, who wants to stay home?  Staying home is so overrated.  I mean what do they expect me to do?    Well anyway yesterday was fun. I went to the beach with Sarah and then Ryan and BethAnne showed up.  Before they got there me and Sarah were just swimming around and I started walking out farther.  Then I like fell off this drop off and almost died.  Well... not really since I can swim, but it was weird.  Turns out it was a hole.  Who knows how deep it was, I wasn't about to check.  After that I went to Jen & Kev's (my sis and her husband) and Paul & Rebekah (my bro and his wife) came too.  It was fun and we played this weird trivia game and skipbo.  Skipbo is cool, it was the first time I played it and I actually won once.  We also played scategories and guess what?  For the first time in my life, I actually won scategories.  I know it's scary.  I almost cried. Then I got hyper and froed my hair and it was even better than at camp.  It was awesome I should've taken a picture.  There's one thing I really want to know.  Is there any guy that cares about more than how hot a girl is?   It's so annoying.  I mean ok I admit it, I notice when a guy is hot, but I don't start liking them until I get to know them.  So I've heard from other guys that they think I'm hot.  Great.  I'd rather not be so then at least when they like me I'll know that they like my personality not just my looks.  And then there's the stupid ones that feel the need to beep at me.  Thank you for that.  Sorry I just need to vent.  Anyways, thats all for now.

      Yeah so I actually got up early enough to watch cartoons.  It's like the first time in months.  The sad part is they just don't make cartoons like they used to.  Kim possible and Lizzie McGuire are great and all, but what happened to Doug, Pepper Ann, and Recess?  It's all so very disappointing... but I guess I'll get over it.  Well I guess I should tell what I did yesterday.  First I had my friend Vanessa's going away party.  Her parents are moving to west virginia and she's going to college there.  It's so sad that she's leaving.  We were like best friends or anything, but we did have some fun times together.  And now my post is looking extremely depressing but it gets better.  At 7 we had a jazz band concert and that was cool even though I played the songs like once or twice and 2 of them I'd never played before.  It was all good though.  When it was over we (me, BethAnne, Ross, Sarah, Ryan, and Ronnie) went to the new coffee shop in Tawas... sorry Leslie the Legacy was closed and just for the record they weren't as good anyway.  We all got iced coffee blenders and they were pretty good, but not as good as the one me and Sarah got at the Legacy.  So anyways after that we all went to BethAnnes and went on her barn swing.  Fun stuff.  Well anyway it's all so excting but I think I'm gonna go and take a shower now........

      Yeah about the fireworks post...lol... yeah I don't know what happened with that.  I was like wow I haven't written in my blog for awhile and then I started to and then I was like wow I'm super tired and I don't wanna write anymore.   So sorry about that.  There's not much to say about the fireworks anyways.  BethAnne and I hung out w/ Leslie for awhile and then watched the fireworks.  After that we just sort of walked around for awhile and got beeped at by drunken idiots.  How exciting!  Yeah not really.  On Tuesday I accidently on purpose slept through summer jazz band.  For some reason I was extremely tired and couldn't force myself out of bed.  I didn't do much at all on tuesday besides sit around until our youth group bible study and bonfire.  That was sorta fun.  Jon showed up and he cut his hair and it looks better actually.  It used to be really long... probably because me and Hannah said that it looked hot long.  Not as long as he let it get though.  But anyways who cares about that.    On Wednesday I was awakened by a call from Leslie's friend Nick, who apparently likes me.  He said he wanted to do something we me and sarah and leslie and stuff later.  I was like sure but we have to do it early because my mom got mad when I was out so late.  That was the extent of the convo but...Ok heres the thing: I don't mind hanging out with him and I like him enough for that but I get the impression that he really likes me.  So then I wasn't sure about it and I was thinking about it and then I talked to Sarah and she was like let's just rent movies and stuff so that's what we did.  I feel bad now that while we were watching movies him and leslie were trying to call us, but couldn't get through for some reason.  Then Ross wanted me and sarah to go to this stupid band concert thing in bay city and sarah begged me forever to go and I was like I'd rather stare at a blank wall but fine only if we can stop at meijer and get some Jones.  So all was peachy until Leslie and Nick called right before we left and nick was all mad.  I told sarah to tell him i was in the bathroom, i don't know why but I guess I wanted to avoid conflict.  I'm like that sometimes.  So now he's like deathly angry and he wrote me a stupid email so I was nice and apologized.  But then he emailed me back today and wasn't quite so mad but still equally annoying... I don't know I guess it'll all blow over.  My activity choices for yesterday were band concert or hang out with nick and I guess I chose the band concert which was as boring as I predicted (no offense to ross or sarah who somehow found in fun and exciting, I can't imagine how).  But at least the band concert got rained out and I went to meijers and found the jones soda.  Then we watched homeward bound 2.. (I know what your think and yes it was and extremely exciting and good movie).  Ross fell asleep and I put makeup on him and he didn't notice when he woke up and I'm still not sure if he did because i forgot to ask him today but anyway... after he left we watched Three Ninjas Kick Back... another great movie... and then I spent the night at sarah's and slept in the spare room on the squeakiest bed ever.  So today me and Sarah watched the last movie- Payback. It was okay.  Not the best but decently good.  We took the movies back and visited Leslie at work and then went home.  At 6:30 I had jazz band and that was fun.  After that we decided to go swimming even though it was like 65 degrees out.  We would've actually done it too if the lake wouldn't have been so furry.  That's right furry.  There was some black looking planty scum stuff in the water that was most likely the home of several thousand small animals.  So I went home (my parents were freaking out about me being gone all the time) and cleaned my pit I mean room.  I now looks somewhat presentable... and that's about it.  Wow I really need to write like ever day and I am definitely in an interesting mood.....  I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIGHSCHOOL CAMP!!!

      Lately I've been wanting to go on a blog strike. I'm not sure why. I guess I just don't feel much like blogging. It's sad, but I guess I'll get through it. I do not want to be one of those people who go for weeks withour updating their blog.....(you know who you are)  Today I got up somewhat early and went to Goodwill with my mom. I like the one in Bay City, but the Salvation Army in Bay City is crap. I got a couple shirts. There's this one shirt that says ymca football. It's cool. I also bought a weathervane sweatshirt and a silver belt. Overall it was a good trip. Driving was annoying though. There was this guy that passed me going like .5 mph faster than me and then slowed down once he was in front of me. So I passed him and of course he sped up, but I just went about 70 until I was way past him. People can be so dumb.  Yesterday Sarah and I went to take back our movies. We also stopped in and visited Leslie. I got the usual. St. Vincents was hoppin. Evan Story was there. I got some toilet earrings... definitely a good investment.  I don't want to start thinking about college yet...... eeeeeee....

      Well this is the church campout weekend.  Currently I'm at home.  I went back to check my email and get some cold medicine.   I was somewhat cold last night.  Not too bad though because my car is nice and cozy and I had a lot of blankets.  Then I got up at 6 to go blueberry picking but my mom forgot I wanted to go and I tried to wave her down, running out in my socks and half-dressed.  They must be blind or something because they didn't see me and I had to drive home and call them.  I realized about half way there that my contacts weren't in.  That was real safe, but I got to go blueberry picking.  A couple nights ago I watched the Bourne Supremecy.   It was good.  Almost better than the first one.  Well my mom wants me to go get some black olives... I'll write more later or maybe not til tomorrow.

      So cedar point was fun. I actually got to ride the Top Thrill Dragster. It was awesome and definitely worth the wait. Luckily we only waited for about 1.5 hours. Here are the rides I went on in the order I went on them:    Raptor  Magnum  Thunder Canyon (or whatever it's called)  Snake River Falls  Millenium Force  Mantis  Power Tower  Top Thrill Dragster  Raptor   Sadly the Wicked Twister wasn't working. I would've liked to have gone on it. Over all Cedar point was fun despite my nasty cold. We didn't get home until 4:30 AM and I slept in until about 2:30 PM. I wish I lived closer to cedar point.  Yesterday Sarah and I went to tawas. We rented 6 movies for 5 days and it only cost $2. We're not sure when we're going to watch all of them but probably this weekend when we're supposed to be having the church campout in Sarah's woods.   Today has been a very intense day so far. I took a shower, went to the post office, bought some kitty litter at carters, and gave my cat a bath. I figured after all that I deserve to relax for the rest of the day....

      I got up pretty early most of the time at the relief sale. On saturday morning we had to serve for the all you can eat pancake and sausage breakfast. We worked from 6-8. I had to go around and give everyone seconds of pancakes... or thirds... or eighths. This one guy seriously had like 8 or 9 pancakes. He was fun though. We referred to him as the pancake guy after that. It was like hey, there's the pancake guy. The amish really like pancakes. At least the amish guys do. Amish are fun.  We ate at this restaurant in Mio on Saturday. I got the shrimp basket. Hannah got a nacho supreme without lettuce and she found this tiny piece of lettuce in it. So she tells the waiter (Matt) that she found a piece of lettuce, just joking with him and he brought her a whole new plate. We left him a 20% tip though. Then when we were pulling out of the driveway she forgot her retainer and she had to go back in and Matt dug throught the garbage and found it stuck to this nasty spaghetti napkin... it was funny.  Well that's all I'm gonna say about the relief sale for now because I've got to take a shower and then drop the tent off at Jen and Kev's and then get my bag from Hannah's and then I have to do some laundry and then I have to make sure I have every thing I need for cedar point and figure out what I'm going to wear. Are youth group decided to wear christian shirts to cedar point. I'm not sure which one I want to wear though. Oh well I'll figure it out. Tomorrow we leave the school at 6:00 so I'm gonna have to get up at like 5... how fun. Actually it will be fun. I'm so excited!

      Sometimes I just wake up with a quote stuck in my head.  That one's from Win a Date With Tad Hamilton, but in all seriousness it wouldn't be so bad if I went around telling people that.  Not very many people take that seriously.  If you don't know what I'm talking about and haven't seen the movie it's ok.  You should be able to figure it out without getting too many brain cramps.   Last night I stayed at my sister's again and watched A Walk In the Clouds.  It was good if you like the really sappy, romantic movies.  Keanu Reeves is actually a very bad actor.  You can't really notice it in the Matrix so much, but when he talks, he sounds like his reading something.  It could just be the way he talks though.  Kind of like if Andy Minard became an actor.  He would just sound like he was reading it.  I find it so hard to actually take the step and do something different with my life.  Changing isn't really an easy thing for me.  I've prayed for opportunities, but I'm not really the type of person that goes up and talks to random people.  I suppose it takes time to be able to do that.  In the mean time I guess I'll just keep trying and hope for the best.  It would be really cool if our youth group could organize a youth rally.  I'm really seriously wanting to do it and it's not just one of those stupid ideas that just get forgotten after a couple weeks.   Hmm... I guess if anyone has any ideas about that let me know.  Well we've got bible study in a few and my mom's buggin me to help her with ebay stuff so I guess that's all for now.

      mmm... lemonade is great. The beach was nice. I feel tired. Stuck On You was weird. I got a microphone in the mail. I spent the night at my sister's last night. My walk that I took yesterday caused me to become scratched and bitten. Rebekah's birthday was a couple days ago. I put some wildflowers on the table......  Ok, are you annoyed yet? I know I am, so enough of that. I'm so glad it's finally cooled off outside. I was practically dying there for awhile, but at least I had the lake to cool me off. There actually was a purpose of the first paragragh. It was a way to say what I did without having to take too long. I'm not feeling very motivated to blog right now I guess.  We were on the way home from the beach and I was like, "What if your name was Sandy Globsky?" It was the first random thing I've said in awhile. I'm not really a random type of person. I'm really bad at that awkward silence so say random words game. By the time I think of something random it's too late. Oh well I guess it's ok to not be so random.  I had a sort of revelation yesterday. We watched a couple of movies that weren't the greatest. I was thinking that I shouldn't have watched them, but I think it's not just about preventing yourself from doing things it's about how you choose to respond to them. I don't know it was just a thought and I think I'm confusing myself even. My mood is really weird right now I guess.... Tomorrow we have bible study and I hope it's actually good and I hope no one acts stupid and I'll try not to. Yes, I know that I can be one of those that disturbs it and I'm going to concentrate this time. We also need to talk about having a youth rally or something and discuss Cedar Point plans.  Ok, I'm going to stop now.... this one post took me like 20 minutes... I think I'm in slow motion.
