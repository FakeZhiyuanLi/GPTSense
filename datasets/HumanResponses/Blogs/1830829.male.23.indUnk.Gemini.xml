      feeling is an interesting concept, we don't actually feel, we think that we do but we don't. On a (non)purpose-society like ours, feelings are a based on the "me" "I" "mine" therefore we only think to feel what is really a demand of a fake morality. Instinct however has always survived within this concept of morality, if you analyze this you will know it has truth and if you are a preception based human you will deny at first but come to the same conclusion, humans are nature demons.  Flesh has always prevailed.

      I look around and all i see is dispair and confusion, people know in their inner that nothing is, spiritually speaking, real. Yes, you think, react,  "feel"  and speak but nothing really matters, you are just sand.

      "The prion (proteinaceous infectious agent). Prions are proteins thought to originate as regular components of neurological tissues in animals: they are not cellular organisms or viruses.  In their normal noninfectious state, these proteins may be involved in cell-to-cell communication. When these proteins become abnormally shaped i.e., prions, they are able to transform molecules of the normally shaped protein with which they come into contact to the abnormal prion configuration. This process is repeated numerous times until the number of abnormally shaped molecules causes overt illness.  When consumed in the diet, prions are thought to be absorbed into the body where, again, they begin the process of changing their normal protein counterparts into prions. The specific prions of interest in disease and their normally configured proteins are those found in mammals; however, similar proteins occur in other organisms, from chickens to yeasts. While the "prion theory" of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) is widely accepted and explains the occurrence of TSEs, there are other theories of the cause of these illnesses."

      Sometimes I like to think about stupid things... like, for instance, if i bleed is it because i live or just because that is what reality makes my body bleed? If i die will you still be here, or has all this been an illusion created by my disturbed mind?  "come come said the spider"  We all live in society, we may like or not but it is our curse or pleasure to enroll on the game of pretend. We are all actors.

      E então o mundo acabou!  O inevitável fim da nossa existência causa-nos tanto receio como interesse. Faz parte do nosso instinto de sobrevivência enquanto espécie tentar precaver ameaça à nossa existência. O mais irónico é que a própria natureza indica-nos todos os dias que somos em número demasiado grande para continuar-mos a existir neste frágil ecosistema.   O fim é inevitável.   "Although Malthus thought famine and poverty natural outcomes, the ultimate reason for those outcomes was divine institution. He believed that such natural outcomes were God's way of preventing man from being lazy. Both Darwin and Wallace independantly arrived at similar theories of Natural Selection after reading Malthus. Unlike Malthus, they framed his principle in purely natural terms both in outcome and in ultimate reason. By so doing, they extended Malthus' logic further than Malthus himself could ever take it. They realized that producing more offspring than can survive establishes a competitive environment among siblings, and that the variation among siblings would produce some individuals with a slightly greater chance of survival."    Yeah... right.

A QUIET BLACKNESS.. A STILL BLACKNESS.. THE KIND OF BLACKNESS THAT DOESN'T PERMIT ME TO THINK EVERY TIME I TRY TO STEP INTO THE LIGHT IT FLICKERS AND DIES ONCE AGAIN I AM LEFT IN THE DARK.. ALONE.. THE ONLY COMFORT I HAVE IS AN ILLUSION OF LOVE AND THE WARMTH OF MY TEARS FLOWING DOWN MY FACE MY BLOOD NO LONGER WARMS ME IT RUNS COLD IN MY VEINS LYING HERE WITHOUT YOU I LOSE ALL HOPE AND I LET THE RIVER OF BLOOD FLOW HOW NICE IT IS TO FINALLY SEE COLOUR RED... RED... ALL I SEE IS RED..

      Sadness used to be just a word... that was a long time ago when time still flooded our lives, it was before this timeless organized anarchy where I seem to be the main character of a nowhere story. It was before the end of times and the beginning of this limbo-alike existence.. We go nowhere to reach noplace and create a noncreation.

      Houve uma altura em que tudo isto fazia sentido, em que n'alguma lógica distrocida o ser humano tinha uma razão para fazer o que faz e ser como é. Neste momento tudo parece ser uma farsa em o homem se torna um automata dependente de regras e instrumentos que tenta quebrar apenas por breves momentos para logo de seguida ficar submisso na compreensão de que a sua vida sem essas coisas vale menos de zero. Esse protocolo de comportamento social obriga a renunciar a nossa natureza e instintos apenas para cumprimento de uma lógica que nada tem a ver com a verdadeira natureza do ser humano. Nós não somos nem nunca fomos seres de lógica, até os primeiros gregos pioneiros na lógica humana admitem que ser humano é ser impulsivo e destrutivo. Numa sociedade rigida o resultado pode apenas ser um, automutilação mental e muitas vezes fisica do indivíduo em  prol de um todo com finalidades puramente lucrativas. O conceito de felicidade que muitas vezes tentamos impingir à juventude é rapidamente substituido pela necessidade de possuir algo não importa o quão banal isso possa ser.

      ...my two cents is common comment/remark used on english/american literature, the meaning is almost instantly acquired by those that hear it but in it's full extension this expression means as much as saying that i have a crippled leg a bad knee or that society is fucking us... in my not so humble opinion, for i'm not humble nor modest, it means i'm nothing, my opinion is just one it mean nothing or at least nothing more than a drunk man being abused in the middle of the street. my two cents

      Bring it on,  take all the time you need. sometimes it's cold and dark and you can't grasp your breath.  Time has ended, keep holding that thought 'til it's too late too soon  to be something else.  comprehension is beyond you like an ethereal dream and I feel so lonely in the quest for an answer

      As I hold my last breath,  you reach out to touch me. EVERY TIME EVERY TIME Just as I am drowning, you bring me air. But darling, look around you. There is nothing to see,  nothing to touch. But darkness and coldness.  Locked inside my mind, I can't express myself. Lost in countless thoughts, I forget what I wanted to say.  Nothing and no one can destroy us. Not love, sex, or even distance. For when there is nothing left, not even hope, we have what others do not... The one thing that cannot be bought, bargained or even stolden, (and I don't' mean love, for "love" can be bought and it's existence is questionable). ...we have a mind.... So ironic that the one thing that makes us human is seldom used...  *surrounded by apes in disguise* CRIS

      Have you ever... listen to the wild and lost phrases of time? it speaks a little like &quot;the pope&quot;, you know he's trying to say something but noone never understands what. I feel like that sometimes... it's like we are seeing the world but it's trapped inside a small glass bubble unable to escape, unable to think, unable to be free. My point is, why do &quot;we&quot;, has in mankind, try contantly to suffocate each other, with no space to breath, to reach new ideas... yes there is still space for new things.. we are not &quot;originally&quot; drowning in a sea of remixes, remakes and reshakes, we are not limited to fusion or a so called technologic advance  way of leaving (read:  the american way, no i don't hate America i simply hate the idea of superiority or rulership... guess why I am unemployed and fond of opensource projects). To be original and to think requires time and space none of these is provided to new generations, schools and society impose restrict ways of thinking and knowledge, there is very little space for creativity &quot;free&quot; of harassment from comunication and marketing... even the web is just a brain killer there's a trillion of info just waiting to be grasped... it doesn't matter if 99,99% is useless and purelly marketing entertainment... just a thought &quot;even the alternative is subject of marketing and comercial appreciation&quot;, you think underground behaviour is a way of hitting society were it hurts? You are wrong, the youth of today are tomorrow's tirans, we are allowed only enough space to breath but just barely.

      Ever wonder what  your  mind is made of? How you think? Why you think? After reading soo many case studies, I have come to the same old conclusion: it is unfair to say that we ALL think.  A few elite get the priviledge of adding the letters pHd or Dr to their names and they consider themselves worthy, intelligent and thoughtful people. Well  I  have news for you baby, they are trained and no more worthy than a computer programmed to strictly follow if..then rules! After all "they" spend years stripping themselves of all feelings and emotions (since these interfere with your intellect), hence you are left with nothing more then a mass of meat that reacts to stimulus, and thus the Behaviourist theories fall into play. So simple it is to categorize others, but how to we categorize ourselves? Who am I? what am I becoming? Who will I become? Can my uncouscious mind answer that? If so bring on the ouiji board!! What do you do when all you can do is think? But not in words..it's difficult to explain..I can't put into words what I am thinking..what I am feeling.. nothign makes sense! Not one thing I have written makes sense except for maybe this:   Thinking is a thing of the past, the future is but a dream, and the present is truly a gift.. so act and don't think

      Time is full of shit, I can tell you that much... it only shows you what is predictable but then rules don't apply ... not anymore... not to anything... not to me, I wonder what others think... not too much it seems... they all look like braindead zombies, do we really have to respect others? If we do, in the name of that only law of respect for each other &quot;my freedom ends where others begins&quot; how can that be? how can that possibly work? It doesn't, not for me neither for anyone else, unless you are a plant... but then again it doesn't work for them also... not for plants not for humans not for planets not for anything in this existence. Lately I have been thinking in doing a new game a new actor on this final play, a bit dramatic sentence you may think.. could be worse &quot;a new game, a new actor on this last dance&quot;.. one of these is correct... all my life (def.:      (Philos) The potential principle, or force, by which the       organs of animals and plants are started and continued in       the performance of their several and co[&quot;o]perative       functions; the vital force, whether regarded as physical       or spiritual.       [1913 Webster]) ...is balanced between forgetness and forgetless. &quot;I don't want this anymore I want to call it off&quot;, forget what never existed.. at least I have a sense of humour, sort of.

      The question is not, so much, &quot;who I am&quot; but &quot;where I'm going&quot;. Why can't I find something new, something i like and appreciate. Everything is the same and something is everything, which means that everything is banal, dull or out of order.. I don't fit in, I'm too strange and odd.. well at least from the inside. I really don't understand what's wrong with the world or even sadder what's wrong with me. Funny, I was a lot happier when i didn't think... ignorance isn't, afterall, the ultimate bless.. stupidity is an essencial part of happiness and intelligence is overrated.  With time I have learned to assume perfection not as an impossible idea but as a standart.  Sometimes I think all I need is someone to embrace and share my ideas.. my thoughts... even my feelings.. that's impossible.. if such thing exists. Right now man or woman are the same I seek their essence not who they are or what they are. Philos. Two years ago I wrote as my mobile phone welcome message, a thought i belived at the time have reached... &quot;Seek balance and you will find peace&quot;. Peace? rarelly achieved and like most human feelings, fake. Feelings are different from organism to organism you know... human chemistry is something interesting, never wondered why the same medication causes different secondary effects? Genetic Variation..

      Somewhere along the way my feelings got away so stolen and corrupted so empty minded I can only remember to forget but i never do four days seemed to have passed but they never do  I'm afraid of you though so in love days are years  and has gone so long ago  deep down in my memory  burried you droughned  And I will never know why it's so wrong for a man to feel why are we condemned  why are we so lonely?  where lays the frontier  between love and insanity? between passion and necessity? I fell so often love so many  A girl is just a girl I'm told  I'm a fool looking for  I'm too smart for this but I can't leave it be new and old  seem so alike  all i know  is that life... goes by... and guilt... never does.

      "Every living creature dies alone"  Lately I have been thinking on the very meaning of words in this sentence, there's something special in writing a thought that affects all of us and make us feel uncomfortable, it dissects the meaning of life and gives an answer that all of us know but try to avoid.. there's no meaning on this nonsense. All things we are told to search and do are just a way to flow through life avoiding a certain and unbearable emptiness that sooner or later affects us all. I have judged this theater of pain, this sadomistic play and i like it.   Like all things this is just a circle and everything is more of the same.

      I close my eyes and my journey begins. A journey into darkness. Deep, deep silence, where nothing exists (but my thoughts) not even you exist there! My mind floats away from my body, into an abyss. And the journey begins. I see nothing  but  you. I think of everything, I think of nothing. Just when I think I am ready to return, I am trapped. trapped inside my own head, I can hear myself think! Just as I begin to question  the existence of my thoughts.. I open my eyes.. And the journey begins again.

          A pack of cards just waiting on top a round, dark wood table, the present, past and future. Seven cards, seven premonitions with a deadly meaning like only seven can have. A prince and a queen, so v.i.p are we, a five and six torment and disgrace, a star as bright as only night can be, and at the end? No other than seven itself so beautiful outside so rotten inside, oh yes what else could it be.          There are some stars outside, few people on the street, a car going by, a twirling wind asking directions to nowhere land, bad luck it seems. This flight is full. After all this is a small aircraft only five seats and million more in each one. A small clay bowl with three peanuts and a gallon of beer.

          I questioned life long before seeing any movie or reading book, i questioned the way things work and man actions by nature, like many did before me... how many of us have not the privilege of writing a book or making a movie although our point of view is by far more plausible or passionable than those that do.          We are denied nothing but simply by thinking we are subject of evaluation and ridiculous accusations.. we grasp our very humanity on a small portion of sanity and if that isn't enough we are strangled by those less fortunated, their stupidity and horror... I say no names, i question myself before others by doing so i should be my only judge and free to live my life has i wish, but i'm not.. Lack of values they say, how inquisitive how tyrant. My choices are mine alone and i regret only those that i hurt, i have no joy on others pain only in doing what i feel i must... thought is my killer, like a suicidal lady i throw myself in the deep waters of pain never to come back.         Sweet pleasure. To rest after all this time after all this torment, so few have touched the sky has i did, just to fall on the ruthless darkness of constrainment. Do you live for yourself or for others sake?         No one knows... things i told you long ago things that I know you don't remember anymore or seem to you just silly theories silly memories silly me will make all the meaning, it is not a matter of choice it simply is, you know me better than anyone and yet you don't know me. strange you think in your quiet bedroom, so far we are in all things, even from ourselves
