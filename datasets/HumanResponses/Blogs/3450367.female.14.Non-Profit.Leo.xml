        hey! It's finally thursday! and 2moro it's firday! YAY! off skool for one week, I've probably already said that. I wore my new skirt 2day that I bought on Monday from New Look, I wore it on Tuesday aswell for skool. I don't think I'll be wearing it 2moro though cos it's nor supposed to be as warm. My mum got my sum super cool and groovy sandals that other day, they have toe posts and they are sooo comfy, it's too hard to say! She also got my this case that I'm gonna put my minidisc player in, it's really cute, it's purple, and looks like a mini hiking bag, with all the elastic and clips ans stuff! LOL! I've got to make a mental note that it's the twins birthday on Saturday, and they are 7. I'll remember now. 4ev@. (or maybe not) g2g for my tea, I'm havin Spag Bol. luv Laura xxx

       I'm here again to write about what happened 2day, I'm treatin this as like a diary. Can other people read this? If you can, can u put a reply on? pls!  Anyway;; I set off to skool. Met my friend and went to the shop to buy our dinner. Then did our lessons. At break, the  "hard""I'm gonna smash ur head in"  girl asked us why we had been bitches to one of our other friends, (which we hadn't) so all her crew sed "Come on, u dont need friends like them, come and hang round with us" So... she did.  We didn't like her anyway!
