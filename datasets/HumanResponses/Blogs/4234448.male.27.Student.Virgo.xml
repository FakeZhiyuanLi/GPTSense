      Not long after the families arrived in Egypt, Herod died.  Fear of attack, however, did not go away.  Herod’s son Archelaus now ruled in place of his father.  Among the mothers and fathers of the children, heated discussions took place.  It was agreed that danger still existed.  A change in kings would not change the plight of king’s subjects.  The Empire and its kingdoms had always outlived its individual rulers.  Egypt, however, was not there home.  If their children were to one day strike at the foundations of the Empire, fear served only to lock them out of their homeland and its promise.  For years their people had lived under the threat of violence.  Nothing would change if they never returned.  Their journey home would be a gamble based upon a hope.  It would be an act of faith.  Not long after their return, the people of Nazareth gathered to dedicate themselves to the upbringing of the children.  Together they pledged to nurture the children with tenderness and warmth, to model the generosity of sharing, to reveal the beauty of creation, to demonstrate the meaning of care for others, to spur their imaginations with stories, to humor them with play, to equip them with the history of their people, to strengthen them with the customs that enabled survival and resistance.   The children became the joy of the people.  They grew and became strong, filled with wisdom.  The presence of God was in them.

      Before I answer the question of why I am experimenting with the writing of my own gospel, let me say somethings about the orginal gospels that might indicate some of the thoughts which lie in the background of my endeavor.   The Gospels in the New Testament were not eyewitness reports.  A typical reconstruction of how they came into being is this:  In a beginning of that is cloudy to us, there was a Jesus who lived and died.  Following his death, there was a period of oral transmission for forty or so years.  During this time, folk stories and sayings of a sort were passed from one teller to the next in a variety of contexts.  Then, some writers came along and began to make this oral tradition a written tradition.  In both traditions, one can imagine that the story was told, embellished, and edited in a number of different ways as people sought to make meaning out of life.  For better or worse, these meanings were always political.  At the end of the long process of telling and writing the story of Jesus, we eventually got some gospels written in Greek.  We get the slightly muffled version of these gospels in our English Bibles today.  When ever I think about this process that created the gospels, I think to myself, "Why did it have to end?"  None of us our ever going to know what "really happened."  So why not continue in our efforts to make meaning out of life by re-telling the story of Jesus?   Why not continue in our search for meaning through the creative excitement that occurs when one's imagination works with the materials of tradition, with the materials that have been handed to us?  Who said we can't do this?

       This may seem presumptuous but I am experimenting with the creation of my very own gospel. If Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John could do it, why not Clearwater. My gospel is going to be a little different from their gospels, however. For example, there is not going to be a Jesus. That's right. No Messiah. This isn't for the sake of making an anti-Jesus statement. It's because I'm interested in imagining a heroic struggle for justice that doesn't focus upon a single charismatic leader. Here, the focus is on a group of twelve souls--men and women--who rebel against an oppressive empire while envisioning an alternative empire ruled by the liberatory ideals.   In the beginning was Justice, and Justice was with God, and Justice was God. She was in the beginning with God. All the wages of struggle came into being through her, and without her not one wage of struggle came into being. What has come into being in her was hope, and the hope was the light of all people. The light shines through the night, and the night never overcomes it.  There was an artist who came from God, whose name was Simmer. Simmer came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe in it. Simmer had the light within him, but his light was small for he was alone. Light shines in its greatest beauty when small lights like Simmer join together to form a larger circle of burning brilliance.  Throughout history, the light has shined. At times, it has been dim and fading. At others, it has been bright and expanding. At all times, the quality of light has depended upon whether the world has allowed Justice to enter into its affairs, guide its passions, and become a living force.  Simmer lived with Justice and knew that the ripening of Justice was to come. He testified that after him would come an era of grace in which Justice would live more fully. He gave his testimony to all. When the religious leaders and political officials heard the murmuring of the crowds, they asked him, “Who are you?” He confessed, “I am just a sign of what is to come. Soon a band of twelve will come. They will do what I cannot.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you a prophet?” He answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for we want to know if there are those who will one day dare to challenge our authority.” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the road upon which God shall travel.’”  That night the women of Nazareth began to sing. Eleven of them were expecting. Their song gave shape to their hopes.  “Our soul magnifies our God, and our spirit rejoices in our Savior, for God has looked with favor on those low who work without pay. Surely, from now on all generations will call us blessed; For the One who endures has done great things for us So that we might see might see the sacredness of Justice. God’s love is for those all, and it lives from generation to generation. God has shown the strength that comes from many arms joined in struggle. God has challenged the words and ways of the proud and arrogant. God has brought down the powerful from their thrones, And lifted the lowly to the level ground of equality. God has filled the stomachs of the hungry with rich and plentiful food. God has reclaimed the wealth stolen by the rich. God has been with us in times of both loss and gain. We remember our God and look toward the promise of the future.”  These women lived in difficult times. In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered as subjects in the Roman Empire. Subjects were ordered to travel to designated towns in order to register. The eleven women and their husbands had to leave the town of Nazareth in Galilee and travel seven miles to city in Judea called Bethlehem.  The journey made birthing strenuous and sometimes difficult for the women. A few gave birth shortly before leaving on donkey without rest or recovery. Across the desert, they carried their fragile newborn. Another two were less fortunate. They were forced to give birth while in the midst of their journey. In Bethlehem, two mothers found luck. One gave birth in the comfort of an inn, while another gave birth at relative’s house. Meanwhile, another gave birth to twins in a stable for animals as another gave birth in an alley. Two gave birth on the way back home.  Some say angels. And, finally, one made it all the way home and was the luckiest of all.  Moving from one birth site to the next were a group of wise men. These wise men had gone to visit the local king, King Herod. King Herod had spies throughout the country. They had gathered information about the coming births of children destined to rebel against the Emperor and his kings. Herod professed that he was not against these children but wanted them to grow strong and fully embody the spirit of Freedom and Peace cherished by the Roman Empire. He then declared that he would give the wise men fine gifts of gold and silver to give to each of the children. Thus, Herod instructed the wise men to track down the women and their newborn.  The wise men, however, did not initially present the gold and silver as a gift. Instead, they honored the infants with songs and tender affections. Softly, they then spoke to the women. Not trusting their king, the wise men then told each woman to stay off the main roads and head towards Egypt before finally returning home. They knew that Herod planned to kill each of their infants. To help them survive this longer journey, the wise men gave them the silver and gold to use for the extra food and lodging.  When Herod discovered that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated. He sent his soldiers to kill all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under. Hundreds of innocent children were killed. Throughout the land, a collective wailing and loud lamentation was heard from parents. They refused to be consoled because their children were no more. In the ground of their grief, a deep anger took root that would never die as long as they lived. Toward the Empire and its kingdoms, they directed their rage.

       Here's the beginning of a new fictional series of blog entries. The main character aspires to be a revolutionary "leader." His means to the vanguard: toastmasters.   For years, I’ve longed to be a revolutionary leader. I’ve dreamed of giving voice to the aspirations of those trapped in the dungeons of despair and indignity. I’ve dreamed of standing upon the convictions of justice as I facedown the evils of our global masters. I’ve dreamed of forming the indignations of the masses into the hammer of protest. I’ve dreamed of envisioning a world to come, a world where members of the human family no longer seek to kill, control, and exploit each other with guns or bombs, prisons or police, industries and markets. I’ve dreamed all of these things, but have never known how to realize them.  I’ve yearned to be at the podium before the chanting crowd, but there has been no crowd. I’ve yearned to lead the march to capital steps, but there have been no marchers. I’ve yearned to rally hunger strikes while jailed for a noble cause, but there have been no noble causes to bring forth my heroism.  I was depressed, disappointed, despairing over having my longings frustrated. If only the world knew of the courage possessed in side of me! I knew there must be a pathway to my blooming, my blossoming. I knew there must be a first step that I could take that would place me on my way to the revolution.  I thought over the matter. I considered how a revolutionary must possess the right critical consciousness. A revolutionary must understand the violence of racism, capitalism, authoritarianism, sexism…A revolutionary must understand the systems and institutions of oppression. Indeed, I did possess this mind. I then considered how a revolutionary must have a vision for the future. A vision for a life where society is organized to ensure equality, individual liberty, self-governance, just rewards…I did possess such a vision. Finally, I considered how a critical and visionary mind needs a platform. What good is a revolutionary if the revolution is stored in a locked closet, shelved amidst broken dreams?  I considered the matter at length. Alternative newspapers were a limited platform. I could write but leaders must do more than write. They must be actors in the public sphere. They must be speakers in town square. I needed a place from which to speak. I racked my brain for where I might speak, how I might take my first steps into that unwieldy world of exposure before the common peoples of this land.  And then finally, I discovered an organization that sought to empower men and women from different walks of life to become public speakers. The name of that fine organization is toastmasters. It is toastmasters that changed my life for the better. It is toastmasters that has placed me on the road to the vanguard.
